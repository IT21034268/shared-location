2,Hair left orangey shade,"I am going gray or white and have been permanently coloring my hair ash brown for years. I wanted to go natural. I used the product through 3 treatments. It did remove the brunette color but left me strawberry blond, not gray or white. I will say in its defense that my hair is not damaged. it is soft and smooth. I do not like this color but I suppose it will grow out and it will not have such a contrast as the brown and gray would."
5,As promised!,"It works! I was dyeing my hair blue-black once a month for almost a year, from root to tip each time, but finally got tired of it. Last time I ripped black out of my hair I used 40% bleach and it fried my hair. There was no way I could grow it out after the bleaching.I split the step 1 and 2 applications in half for two sessions right after the other, as the directions suggest, and threw out the third step (do not want darkening!). Kept it on my hair 30 minutes each time under a plastic bag, rinsed for 5-10 mins, shampooed and rinsed 5-10 mins. First time lifted more at the roots. Second time, I can see the natural auburn of my hair down to the ends. Wow. It's a little redder than usual, like it's been in the sun, but my hair is still soft and pliable. Ten times better than the L'Oreal color fixer I used.About the smell. Yes, it's sulfur, but it's not bad. I used to work at a resort with natural sulfur hot springs, and this is mild compared to that."
1,Stay away!,"I just used this to lighten a dark brown shade I dyed my hair about a week ago...I applied it twice, kept on for max 20 minutes as advised, and NOTHING! My hair is not even a tad lighter! On top of it, the smell is beyond sickening (no words to describe it, really), gave me a headache and stunk up my entire house! Here I am, in the middle of Chicago winter, it is 8 degrees outside, and I have all my windows open trying to get rid of this horrific stench. I've also washed my hair about 10 times and the smell is still lingering, ugh. About to go to the store and pick up a true and tried hilighting kit - gets rid of the color after one application and NO smell :)"
3,Not for every situation...,"I used this, trying to remove some semi-permanent that refused to come out (Ion ColorBrilliance Brights in Sky Blue on bleached hair). This did nothing. I achieved no lift, there was not even any colour in the water. I don't recommend this product if you're having trouble removing a semi-permanent colour that sticks around, stubbornly, on bleached hair. I will, however, give it a 3 star rating because I know it has worked well for other people in my life, removing permanent colour."
1,Doesn't work!!!!!!!,"You know all this good reviews,but I agree with one review on the begining. What jet-black color did you all use? I been dyeing my hair blue-black for about 20 years. I put this application 5 times, and it did not remove a bit of color. So if you dye your hair black for years: don't bother with this stuff!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Turned hair strawberry blond,I am a guy with medium brown hair. I have about 15% gray. My barber put a dye in my hair to cover the gray but after a while it turned a brassy color. I bought colorfix to take out that dye. I had hoped my hair would return to its natural color. I could live with the gray but not with the brass color. But my hair turned strawberry blond. It looks awful. I will buy a brown hair dye now in the hopes it will cover the strawberry blonde color. My hair also smells awful.
1,Junk,"First of all, the process alone that you have to go through is entirely too much. Apply product, wash out and repeat 2-3 times?You're better off finding an easier product that will actually strip the color out in ONE try and leave an orange base so that you can recolor.My hair was red.. And now it's blue from this crap. BLUE. And if I reapply, it's unlikely that it will remove the blue.Don't do it."
5,one'n only COLORFIX is AWESOME!!,"I dyed my hair ""Morticia"" black...not a good look for a 70yr old.I used one box, & followed directions carefully (except for usingthe Processing Lotion). I used an empty,wellwashed, dish detergentbottle to mix parts 1 & 2: I applied the product liberally through out my hair with my hands, I used an ordinary plastic grocery bagto cover my head for 20 min. I also used my disposable garden gloves..I was surprised these items were not in the box. (I did not use theProcessing Lotion)..I washed and rinsed my hair as directed. Long story short..I now have beautiful, soft auburn hair with gold highlights.p.s. yes, it's going to be smelley for a little while :)"
5,Truly amazing,"Wow! This product is amazing. After having jet black hair for a few months, I wanted to go lighter. I didn't have a specific level of lift in mind, just something lighter. After one application, my hair was significantly lighter. I'm pretty hard to please, and I was impressed with how well this worked and how decent my hair felt afterwards. It does have a bit of a sulfur smell, but I don't think it is any stronger than the smell of hair color. If you want to remove color yourself, I would strongly recommend this product."
2,Wow wish I would of read the reviews before buying,My keyboard had quit on me unexpectedly so when I saw this bundle I decided to buy it. Waste of money especially when you consider the mouse.I love the keyboard the buttons on it are nice and I like the range I can have without the wire.The mouse sucks for me. There is a terrible lag and the mouse will scroll all over the screen and it sometimes just stops for awhile almost like it is frozen. I despise the mouse and I am forced to use it which makes me even more mad because it doesn't work.I would not recommend this product to anyone. The bundle is not worth the money in my opinion.
2,Cheap product for the money,"This was my first purchase of wireless keyboard/mouse. I am very disappointed that HP offers such a cheap product! The mouse runs through batteries like crazy! The ""door"" to change the batteries is so hard to take off, I ended up breaking the clip and now the mouse is pretty useless. Not to many problems with the keyboard. If we have a power outage or when I do change the batteries, I have a hard time getting them to re-connect to the computer. I have purchased another combo from Logitech for the same cost and LOVE it!Bottom line - if you have $50 to waste and want to have to change batteries constantly, this would be your product. Not a good buy."
2,Sad,The orchestra seemed to overwhelm the singer. I wanted to hear his great voice--but it didn't happen for me.
1,Waste of Money,"If you use only this book, you will not pass the exam. The practice exams include topics that are not covered anywhere in the book. The level of detail provided by both the exams and the content is not sufficient to pass the real exam. I scored 95% - 100% consistently on all exams in this book including the 3 bonus exams on the cdrom and still did not pass the real exam. I found that the real exam covered several topics that either were not covered at all in this book or did not provide the level of detail or understanding necessary to pass the exam."
2,Not enough to pass the exam,"I passed the exam and used this book during my study but fortunately not only this book.Pros- The book is clear and quite pleasant to read- You certainly need to know what's in this book to pass the examCons- All subjects in the test list are covered but not in depth- During this Oracle certification exam, you will have basic questions about backup/recovery and Oracle networks concepts. You will certainly be able to answer these questions if you have a good understanding of the content of this book. On the other hand, you will also have ""mastery"" questions which required an in depth knowledge of the subject (mainly of commands). The answer to these questions is simply not in this book. Approximatively 1 question out of 3 are concerned which in my opinion is too much."
2,Lite on the subject matter,"Having used the previous two study guides in the set for Oracle 9i DBA OCP, I found the third book (this one) to be missing the depth the first two had. I've been using Oracle's online documentation to supplement my study. This book gave me a good overview for starting, but the authors seem to pick a few examples for mostly illustrative purposes, and the questions just didn't do the subject material justice. I expect more from a study guide than just that. Organization could be better too. (Same goes for Oracle's docs.) There are so many convoluted ways to backup/restore/recover that a study guide needs to bring it all together in a concise summary. Of course that's a good exercise left to the student, along with the some hands-on stuff, which I need to get back to. I just wish I had a study guide that made better sense of it all."
2,Does not meet the Exam objectives,I used this book as supplement and the oracle press book (R. Velpuri) as main reference. This book published by sybex does not account for all the objectives covered in the exam (1z0-032). The books covers some of the topics but not into details. I read the whole book twice and gained some knowledge out of it but I believe it is not a complete study guide for preparing for the exam. I also used the practice exam questions on the CD.
5,Great actionable guide to the music business,"This is a real workbook that helped me get to where I can pitch my songs to publishers and producers, and feel comfortable and recognized in town. You rate where you are in your career at the beginning and take small doable steps towards your goal. I'd already had my first cut (and others) when I bought the book, but it helped me get more. My book is so well-used the cover's fallen off and the pages curl (it's a well-made book, but I've used it, traveled with it, copied it...worn it out!)"
5,Great guide book!,"As an aspiring songwriter I bought this book, at the time for grins and kicks, but it has become very valuable to me. For those people who like step-by-step guides and a plan to do something, and want to be songwriters, this book is for you. It covers the basic steps of how to get your first cut in 20 chapters, and there is a lot of insight and advice from other songwriters. If you are even curious, I would say buy this book. I'm actually considering getting a second copy!"
5,The taskmaster you need!,"This book is not reslly a book, it's an action plan for your songwriting career. Everything you need to do is laid out in a clear and easy to follow order, with plenty af helpful advice, personal experiences and links to added resources. I personally appreciate the larger print used and the included space to make your own notes. The book also does not let you make excuses, as it predicts the kinds of things that might impede your progress and warns you of the thi8jngs you yourself might do to derail your success. I have not completed the process yet, so I can't give a results-oriented review, but I can say that I have read many books about ""making it"" in the music business, and this one is the easiest to follow and seems to have real and USEFUL information."
3,Hitchcock Collection,the advertisment on a VHS movie that I own states that this collection is supposed to have 14 movies -- all that is presently listed on-line PLUS the movie: Rear Window
3,Only showcases some of Hitchcock's best work,"I actually rate this 3 1/2 stars but that was not an option. Anyway...The packaging, remastering, and inclusions of the theatrical trailers were all great, granted, but this is not all of Hitchcock's best work. Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, and I was shocked to see all the great movies that were omitted (REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE 39 STEPS, NOTORIOUS, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REBECCA, and THE LADY VANISHES) that are much better than many of these mostly mediocre movies (TORN CURTAIN, TOPAZ, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and ROPE). However, this collection does include 4 of my top 6 Hitchcock movies: PSYCHO, VERTIGO, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and THE BIRDS. I suggest you avoid this collection, and get the quartet I just listed and the 7 other classics I previously mentioned separately. You will be much more satisfied with them than if you bought this collection, trust me."
3,"If You Hated the Movie, You'll Love the Book!","Don't let the movie steer you away from this title! Check out the book, and see all the funny stuff that was left out of the script."
5,Mean and lean and probably lost on the masses,"I realize this is an old title, I've not had a chance to get to all of the back list, I only first read Hiaasen a couple years ago.Anyway, Hiaasen is a writer, pure and simple, but he also has a good idea of what goes on in the human mind and behind closed doors. That kind of cynicism and satirical writing can be horrible if not handled well, but he pulls it off and I've enjoyed the several titles I've had a chance to read.This one was funny and pointed out some of the absurd things we let happen in our houses of government. While the story centers around a stripper, it is really a story about corruption and politics.In any case, if you haven't had a chance to check out this author, this is a good a place as any I suppose and I give this one a strong recommendation."
3,TOO MUCH TEASING!,"After reading Sick Puppy and Skinny Dip, I expected more laughs. Perhaps working in the spouse/child abuse field, this was not so funny to me. But I admire Carl Hiaasen's love for Florida and his not-so-subtle frustration with its head-in-the-sand abuse of the ecosystem. As a recent resident of Florida, I total agree with him.Erin, the stripper, was a survivor. Her husband, Darrell, never saw further than his next sentence and lived in a drug induced state most of his life. Loser was tatooed into his DNA. Mr. Hiaasen is an iconoclast and his humor teaches without pontificating. Although his other two books were funnier, I really dug this one. Loved the way he got in a plug for the Miami Herald too.Detective Garcia and Shad were excellent foils. With the political season heating up, the book ended on the note that no matter how many shysters are caught, there is always another hundered in the wings. Definitely will read another of Mr. Hiaasen's books."
5,This bok is the best I've read in a long time!,"This book is the first I have read from Carl Hiaasen. I 'll tell you, He is one talented guy! Once I got past the first page, I couldn't put this book down. Since then, I've read almost all of his books. all of them are excellent! This is a must read. You won't be able to stop smirking when you are reading this book! It is so funny. Believe me, this is a book you don't want to pass by!"
4,Keeps you laughing but leaves you thinking...,"Tourist Season was my first exposure to the world according to Hiaasen. It blew me my mind like ""Sergeant Pepper's"" must have done to music lovers in 1969. Since then I have read Native Tongue and Strip Tease, and am always impressed with the ferocity of Hiaasen's humor. Hiaasen's humor is a cogent and non-pedantic vehicle for his human, moral and environmental concerns. Living in Japan I especially appreciate Strip Tease's exposure ( no pun intended ) of the hypocrisy of U.S. sugar subsidies in an era where we so vociferously decry similar protectionism in other nations. But Hiaasen makes his point without sounding nearly as preachy as I do!"
2,Contrived and Overrated,"Hiaasen manages to sprinkle this book liberally with witty one-liners, but not enough to overcome the contrived plot and the cardboard characters. The description and indictment of the U.S. sugar industry are interesting, but the action in the book relies on far too many coincidences, and the characters are all comic-book heroes, villians, and buffoons. Not awful, but disappointing."
2,"All voice, no substance.",Hiassen is one of those writers for whom it's all about voice. However from a reader's point of view an author's voice can be intrusive. In a work of this genre I prefer to be so engaged by the story and the characters (and their own distinct voices) that I'm not aware of the author's voice at all.Striptease is superficially clever but there wasn't enough beneath the cleverness to engage me. It was promising to begin with but after a while my smile became fixed. I felt like I was just there to listen to Hiassen speak. I've never been tempted to read another of Hiassen's books.
2,Disappointed,"While this book was my brother's favorite, I had difficulty even finishing it. I actually put it down for weeks, then finally made it through to the end. I didn't 'like' many of the characters, the politic was 'everyday', and I missed the great descriptions of natural Florida. Hiaasen is one of my favorite authors, but this is one of my least favorite of his books."
3,Another enjoyable comic caper by Hiaasen,"The one thing you can say about Hiaasen's books is that you'll never be disappointed with the endings. His novels are neither thrillers nor mysteries. As one of his characters mentions, it's more about ""sweet justice"". In this comic caper, it's Erin Gant's turn to set things straight with her ex-husband, who currently has custody over their daughter and likes to steal wheelchairs, and a congressman, who is obsessed with her, simply because she's the best dancer at the Eager Beaver strip club. Blackmail drives this plot as certain unsavory characters try to expose the congressman for assaulting a patron at the Eager Beaver. Hiassen gives his characters an unhealthy dose of ambition, which often leads to amusing hijinks. Many of them are obsessed with get-rich-quick schemes, and they end up falling on their face. Get ready for lots of laughs."
4,"Absurd, cynical, twisted and credible","Again Hiaasen provides a delightfully savage lampoon of the political system with particular scorn for politicians and lobbiests. He clearly has a formula, but its one that results in books that are a tonic for those who are totally cynical politically with a taste for somewhat warped sardonic humor.In ""Strip Tease"" Hiaasen flays the criminal justice system and corporate agriculture in particular. This farce is formed around a strip tease bar, and the story's heroine is one of the performers. Hiassen uses a misogynistic set to highlight what he highlights as the Achilles heel in male judgement as well as corporate greed and decadence and the political system which enables it (or it enables).This is not great literature, but is an entertaining romp. A great poolside, airplane, or vacation novel for the reader with a more than three digit iq."
2,least favorite,I've read a number of Hiaasen's books and this is my least favorite. It lacks the clever character development that Sick Puppy has. I barely got through it and I'm a big fan of his!
5,Strip Tease,"Haven't read this yet, but am very happy with the condition of the book and how quickly it arrived. Have read many of Hiaasen's books and know it will be a fun read."
1,Very disappointing after skinny dip,I ordered this book as the reviews said it was funny. I found Skinny Dip so funny that at times I could not see thru tears of laughter. But I am 3/4 thru Strip Tease and have yet to laugh.The characters are so strange they are off-putting so I'm not going to finish the book.
1,Not Funny,"I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them. They were very funny. This one is not. It is an endless description of naked strippers. I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing. She is just so stupid. Her problems are all of her own creation. And she is not funny. I think you have to be a man to like this book. I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring. I kept waiting for it to get funny. It never did."
1,The overall rating should be 0 stars,"Excluding the reviews prior to the set coming out, all ratings were 1 star, except for 1. The higher ratings were pre-viewing, mostly anticipation. DVD viewing is supposed to have special features. If one wanted to just see a movie, they would purchase VHS. The poor quality of this product shameful for the DVD industry. Products should be monitored before it gets released. Everyone who purchased the set deserves a REFUND if they want. The refund should come from the people that released it."
1,Avoid buying this at all costs!!! (0 stars if I could do it),"Poor transfer, all the movies are VHS dubs to DVD, no enhancement whatsoever, and with Shining and Full Metal Jacket in Mono and pan and scan (two of the better movies), This set just isn't worth it.This is a serious rip off, and isn't worth more than $70 for the whole set. I don't see how warner can expect $100 for this set with poor, low quality transfers that are almost completely lacking in extras.I would ask for my money back, but I bought it at 50% off, which makes it mildly worth the price paid."
1,Thanks for the Warning,Thanks guys for the warning! I was about to purchase the Kubrick collection and I read the reviews... Money well spent is sometimes not spent at all
1,Kubrick is great...this DVD set isn't,"I rented a few of this set this week and I must say it's disgraceful! I just got a DVD player and watched films like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Das Boot, which were in pristine condition. This DVD set sucks! Believe me, you guys musn't buy it...thank god I didn't."
3,What happened to proper aspect ratio?,This is a fine collection of films but what do I find when I rip the pastic away? Three of the films have been 'formatted' to fit the screen. This is horrible. I feel really let down. What is the point of putting together a set of films by one of the best directers that ever lived if you're not going to show the entire footage? Stanley is turning in his grave!
2,"Wonderful films, horrible transfers","Well, alas, to just get it out of the way, this long-awaited collection just about fails on all counts. Though analyses of Kubrick's work is not the focus here, a basic perusing of the set as a whole reveals a surprising, even shocking, lack of effort expended. The transfers are dated, the sound mixes unexceptional, and the menus bland. The packaging is sparse, though director-approved. Aside from the usual theatrical trailers and a very nice documentary on The Shining (which offers a glimpse of what could have been), there isn't a single meaningful supplement. There isn't even any exciting booklets or extensive text celebrating the work. Just a few ""Collector's Cards"" of the poster art. Last but not least, there is not a single anamorphic transfer is present in the bunch, with some discs even presented full frame, and the two reissues of previously released Kubrick discs are insulting. (from www.dvdfile.com review site)"
1,Do not buy this set,"Like the last reviewer said, Warner really pushed these out the door, obviously to coincide with the publicity of Eyes Wide Shut, and the master's death. What a waste. Extremely low quality DVDs. I never thought I'd recommend Ghostbusters over Stanley Kubrick, but the difference in quality of features and presentation is striking. It's like having a Monet exhibit shown in a crummy high school in dirty plastic frames.Do not buy any of these movies. Wait for Warner to rerelease them with features and better transfers."
2,"Save you money, remastered edition coming out in June, 2001.","For those of you thinking about getting this set, save your money. This boxed set was rushed and poorly done. The new remastered editions come out in June 2001."
1,Get The New Box Set!,"Of course, Kubrick was a genius and all these films are great, but this set is really lacking, with horrible sound and atrocious picture quality. Happily, WB quickly rectified the mistake by msking ""The New Stanley Kubrick Collection."" What sounds like a cash cow turns out to be a carefully planned, beautifully remastered set with ample special features that I'm pretty sure would satisfy Kubrick, and I'm completely sure will satisfy any fan. Go order that set.PS: This set is out of print now, and for good reason."
2,"Great movies, horrible transfers","Format debate aside, the transfer is horrible. Grainy, bad sound mixing, washed out color in the color pictures. It's worth waiting until someone who loved these wonderful films decides to put together DVDs worthy of the films on them."
1,Avoid this DVD set.,"If you love Kubrick's work, then leave this on the shelf, and wait until a re-release. I can't believe that a perfectionist such as Kubrick would have approved this technically sloppy, substandard recording of his art. Otherwise, only buy this from a merchant who will give a full refund!"
1,Robbed of the benefits of dvd...,"I concur with colleagues in saying that this collection leaves much to be desired. If you are looking to finally enjoy Full Metal Jacket in all of its widescreen and surround sound splendor, as I was, you will be woefully disappointed. I think that Warner Bros. owes all of us the quality films we deserve. Despite all of that, I do think that 2001 was the only worthy feature-filled film offered in this collection."
3,Aspect Ratios,"I agree with the rest of your reviews, with one exception. Both full Metal Jacket and The Shining were shot in the full frame aspect ratio. It is irritating, but that is how they are supposed to look."
5,What are you lot complaining about?,"I can't see what most of you are complaining about. Sure the picture is sometimes slightly pixled, and some times the voices are slightly out of sync with the picture, but when you have 7 of the greatest films ever made I feel you have no course for complaint. Kubrick supervised these, and I know it's how he wanted it to be. And for those people complaining about the lack of extras, just look on some site, there's copious amounts of downloads to satisfy you. The sound isn't half as bad as most of you say it is, if it's not loud enough for you just turn up the volume.I truly believe this is the best way to commemorate Stanley's death, and just serves to show what the world is now missing."
1,Some movies lack full-frame and few extras,I highly doubt Kubrick would allow his DVDs to be produced in standard format. There are almost no extras. This collection is insulting to the master. Avoid until Warner Bros. does the director justice.
2,The Disembodied Voice of Stanley Kubrick Does Not Approve,"These DVDs are the reason I bought a DVD player. Each film in this collection (with the possible exception of Lolita) is a masterpiece. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered the lack of care and effort that went into these DVDs. The transfers are poor and unrestored, the audio is plain old vanilla stereo, a few films are pan-and-scanned, and not a single special feature of note to be found. This could have been a 4-year film school in a box. It isn't anywhere close."
5,Great collection!,This is the greatest seven-title collection on 8 VHS tapes from the legendary director Stanley Kubrick.
3,Kubrick's wishes?,"I want the DVD edition of a movie to look as good as it possibly can. I'm dismayed that FULL METAL JACKET and THE SHINING are in full-screen format, supposedly as the director wished. [Had he lived, might he later have ordered widescreen editions once DVD had caught on with the masses? We'll never know.] I distinctly remember wonderful horizontal compositions in both films. Kubrick's trademark wide-angle dolly and Steadicam shots definitely lose something in the translation. Therefore [the films are phenomenal, don't get me wrong], the set gets only three stars from me. It was one last stunning surprise from Mr. Kubrick, just not in my mind a pleasant one."
5,"Best formats, best movies, best director, Gotta have!","Yea, I know, the price seems a little steep... but it's not.Not when you consider that Stanley Kubrick has been one of the finest directors and his movies are some of the very best made.Making history with these movies covering the best of his career films from 1961 to 1987, you just can't go wrong.The power that these movies carry is inspiring.DVD Format! Excellent choice. WideScreen! Excellent choice. Thorough collection!If you enjoy movies, this collosal gathering is the best I've found.Grab it!"
2,Great Movies on Terrible DVDs,"Stanley Kubrick is arguably one of the greatest film makers ever. It is a crying shame that soon after his death, those who would try to capitalize on his talent, would do a rush job on releasing these DVDs. The video quality on most of the movies is poor at best. The audio quality is terrible on most of them. It is just a shame that the engineers of these DVDs didn't take just a bit more time and do them right. If you like these movies then get this collection since the chances of ever seeing any better engineered versions of this set aren't very likely."
2,Kubrick DVD Box is BOMB,"Although highly anticipated, the ""new"" dvd releases in this box set are mediocre and often sub standard. The worst aspects of compressed digitalization are woefully apparent in ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Shining"". Worst of the bunch ,and possibly the worst DVD transfer since ""Blade Runner"" is ""Barry Lyndon"". The bit rate for each scene barely moves over 40% for all scenes and there is a lot of motion artifact, digital pixels on faces, shimmering in the purportedly static background, washed out color and marginal sound. Add to that the extremely ""cheap"" (read - cheap!!) menus and artwork on the discs themselves and you have my vote to return to vhs copies and laser disc on these . The exceptions are ""lolita"", ""2001"" and ""Strangelove"" all of which are from superior transfers. Warners should be ashamed."
4,Not as bad as I thought.,"I read the reviews AFTER I ordered the set and they were already on their way. At first I considered returning them unopened to get a full refund but decided against it. I'm glad I kept them. After watching the DVD's I couldn't figure out what all of the fuss was about. With the exception of Full Metal Jacket, the quality is not all that bad and 2001 is excellent. All are better than VHS and the sale price was about the same as a VHS box set. Too much complaining and not enough enjoying. If you are a fan of these movies in general, you will enjoy the set."
2,"Use As Back Up to Your Other Study Guide ""ONLY""","I will say that I am a fan of ExamCram2 Series of Study Guides, and that is what they are: ""Study Guides"". I was disappointed about the lack of material in this guide, do not rely on this book to pass the 70-272 Exam. If you pass the test just by reading this book you may have all ready had enough knowledge to pass. This book does not cover all the material in the exam by any means. The MeasureUp testing software is nice to get you use to the way some of the exam questions are. I would use this book to just go over questions and answers before you do a final write. I highly suggest to get Microsoft 70-272 Training Kit if you are new to alot of the material covered by this exam."
3,Deeply insufficient,"My IT background: ten years as a Unix admin, pursuing a Master's degree in Telecom. Extensive familiarity with desktop OS's and apps both as a user and LAN admin.Newcomers to IT hoping to use this book as a primary study source will be disappointed.I scored a 754 on 70-272 (700 is passing). The Exam Cram helped a bit in focusing which aspects of the Office, Outlook, and IE GUIs with which to become familiar. However, entire topics on the exam were completely unaddressed by this book (""Security Center"", GPOs). Moreover, The book was apparently written before XP SP2 was released; the test requires knowledge of SP2 features."
3,Not Enough,"The book had a lot of useful information, however it did not really go indepth on any of the subjects. I wish the book had given more examples or details on the topic. It provided only 145 questions, compared to other books for the test that provided over 300. I gave the book 3 stars because it is a useful study guide that can fit into my purse so I can take it everywhere. I would suggest reading something more in depth first."
2,Not enough depth,"This book provides a good high level overview of the material. The main shortcoming is that it makes statements like ""make sure you know this or that"" but doesn't explain or provide examples. I took the test and passed, but don't think this book contributed a lot to my success. This book is worth a read, but don't rely on it."
1,I never received this item!,I am throughly disappointed! I have never received this item. I paid for the entire order and I have yet to hear from or receive any correspondence from this seller. I made an attemp to reach out to the seller via email with no reply. I will never use Amazon again!Sherry Battle
5,For my daughter,"I love this music and I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Hopefully, she will gain appreciation of Classical music."
2,Seen it all before,"The only thing to fear in ""Fear City"" is the fact that you've seen it all before and you're about to waste 96 minutes of your life seeing it again. This 1984 hybrid slasher/soft core porn flick boasts an impressive cast with some prominent actors at the start of their careers (Tom Berenger, Billy Dee Williams, Melanie Griffith) and some well established ones (Jan Murray, Rossano Brazzi) in the mix.The film's director, Bronx born Abel Ferrara, is best known for his gritty films like ""Bad Lieutenant"" (1992) and ""King of New York"" (1990), both of which are similar to this film - set in New York, lots of crime, sex, and death. Think of this film as the tune up for the later films, which are considerably better, albeit no Oscar contenders. His long time collaborator, Nicholas St. John is credited as the writer, but one has to wonder if he is a real character or merely a nom d'plume for Ferrara himself.Bottom line - give this one a miss."
2,This is not a documentary.,"The movie is based on testimonies of Arabs who live in Jenin and have experienced, in what they claim: A Massacre. Set in the ruins of the battle that took place there, a picture of miserable life is painted by Mohammed Bakri, using provocative editing, almost like a holocaust film.As a documentary, the movie fails, as its plot is twisted out ofreality, therefore, it is regarded as a personal film and not as a Documentary.As a film, the movie is quite repetitive and boring. Same interviewees repeating on describing their misery, rather than using visuals of some action to demonstrate what happened in Jenin.I would recommend to pass on this film, as it is a waste of time.Watching the world news can help you understand the condition of the Palastinians better than this film.4 out of 10."
1,Fabrication and Lies,"Jenin was a terrorist base used to launch suicide attacks against Israel that killed Jews, Christians and Israeli Arabs. Every piece of supportable evidence debunks any massacre claim. Even the UN, which is openly politically biased against Israel, stated that there was no massacre and also stated that Jenin was a terrorist base camp. The Arab world has many legitimate issues with the west. But continuing to propogate total falsehoods will not solve any of the problems and will not help the Palestinian civilians who are caught in the middle. Israel will make peace with a real partner as they did with Egypt and Jordan. No peace can be made with terrorism and terrorists."
1,Wretched pack of lies,"Folks, this is simply propaganda which does not follow with any of the facts the UN and other international organizations have found. A much better and factual expose of the Jenin story is ""The Road to Jenin""."
1,Why Did it Happen?,"If this film is to be believed, an Arab refugee camp was suddenly attacked out of the blue and subjected to brutalities and atrocities without any rhyme or reason whatsoever. This truly sounds kind of farfetched, and I'd like to know what really prompted the attack and the true extent of the damage and human costs. If you do decide to view this film, be prepared for an endless litany of complaints, accusations, calls for revenge and unrelenting hatred."
5,"The Road to Jenin VS Jenin Jenin, Since You Left","There will always be a stark disconnect between the two differing realities of Palestinians and Israel. Both dvds, The Road to Jenin VS Jenin Jenin, Since You Left, discuss the Jenin city and camp battles, but there are two realities. The occupied Palestinians see it as a massacre and on the flip side from the Israelis as a justified cause. The amount of damage to Jenin could not have been sustained by the Palestinians as Israel would like us to believe. The conclusion of both dvds exemplify Israel needs to step out of the way and allow Palestinians the freedom to grow and heal. The only way Palestinians can heal is to pull away from their adopted parent, Israel. Palestine must become an independent entity. Everyday Israel delays this, creates another sore to heal and another misunderstanding or disaster waiting to happen. Israel has world access to media and promotes their misguided delays quite well."
5,McHale's Navy in a different country.,"I was a bit leary when I ordered Season Four of McHale's Navy. Having the first three season already, I wanted to complete my series with season four. I am glad I did. My only regret is that this was the last season of McHale's Navy."
1,Gary Hoyt,"Sorry to disagree with the favorable reviews-+++There is a reason, this was the ""last and final season""++++Save your money and if you haven't purchased the previous seasons of McHales Navy use it wisely and spend it on the more previous seasons."
1,NOT IN COLOR--THIS IS IN THE ORGINIAL BLACK AND WHITE,"I expected McHale's Navy Season Four to have been colorized, since it is stated COLOR in the Product Details section under Format. I received this season in the orginial BLACK AND WHITE verision. My father and I were very disappointed, since we have all the episodes already in black and white and were excited to see one of our favorite shows in a color verision. I wouldn't have purchased this if the product details stated black and white. Also, I have had a very difficult experience with the Amazon represenatives I have dealt with regarding this purchase."
3,JAMES BROWN 12 Top Ten Hits,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. THE FIRST CD [LIVE] WAS SO TERRIBLE! BUT, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE SECOUND CD WAS JUST GREAT! THOSE SONGS WERE ORIGINALLY ON JAMES BROWNS' [TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO] ALBUM."
2,Shark hand held vacuum not so great,I have the Shark and also a B&D dust buster and hands down the B&D is better. now admittedly Shark has more initial power but it soon dies and the last 4 min. of power is totally useless then it takes ANOTHER 20 HOURS to recharge and in this case the manual is wrong you can't get a full charge is 10 hours. on the other hand the B&D is ALWAYS charged always ready for use. also Shark tech support is horrendous.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this vacuum from the store after I lost my previous hand vac in a move. (the previous one was a different model and worked really well) After owning this vacuum for about a month I have already trashed it. I could not get this vacuum to pick up even the little stuff. I've actually had to bend down and stuff small items into the vacuum. Also, unless I hold it at just the right angle to the floor it won't pick up anything. I have only been using it on hardwood though, so perhaps it works better for carpet. It just didn't work for me."
1,charger problem,"I have two Shark 15.6V, one charger stop work in 6 months, the other stop work in 9 months, as they suggested I bought one new charger ($14), it only last for 2 months, asked warranty for charger but they suggested me buy new one again. I quite no more.Do not buy the new charger as they ask you the quality control is bad."
2,Poor battery life,"I had the virtually identical, earlier version of the vac and it was great... power and long battery life. Finally, the batteries died and I removed them for recycling. The batteries were substantial. I ordered a new unit and it seemed identical but lighter... something is different. I believe the battery pack is much smaller and hence, the shorter run time. I tried the battery maintenance tips but they didn't really help. I just believe the battery pack is inadequate for more than a few minutes of run time. Too bad this ""update"" is inferior to the original, but looks identical. Time to look for another brand."
2,Decent while it lasts,"Like many other reviews, I found this vacuum to pick up dirt/hair/small debris quite well in the beginning. But soon the battery gets worse and worse, barely being able to hold a charge. I saw some posters describe a precise cycle for charging/depleting (and even to go against the recommendations in the manual); this does not make a good product. I followed the manual recommendations, and would be happy with a significantly reduced charge over time, but this is just ridiculous. I find it ergonomically satisfactory, easy enough to empty, and overall very sturdy. But without being able to hold a charge, it's not worth it."
1,A TOTAL waste of money.,"I bought this vacuum despite the reviews that it didn't hold a charge figuring that the people who wrote those reviews didn't follow the directions explicitly. Well, I was wrong. I followed the directions completely and this vacuum does not hold a charge at all. I couldn't vacuum a 2 sq foot area before the battery drains. It also kicks out a fair amount of dust when turned on. The only positive is that it looks cool. If you want an ornamental vacuum that doesn't work at all, then this is a good product. Otherwise it is a complete waste of money."
2,NOT GOOD IN MY BOOK HERES WHY!,"I BOUGHT THIS MARCH 3RD, USED IT TWICE, WENT TO CHARGE IT, AND IT WONT TAKE A CHARGE!I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY ARE ALL INDIAN, AND YOU CANT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THEY SAY.ANYWAY THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND ME A NEW CHARGER, THAT WAS 4 WEEKS AGO, I HAVE CALLED 4 TIMES, THEY NOW TELL ME THEY DONT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GET CHARGERS IN!I AM AN ENGINEER, SO I GOT OUT MY TICK TRACER AND ITS SHOWING THERES CURRENT FROM THE CHARGER TO THE VACUUM, SO WHEN I TOLD THEM THIS, THEY SAID THAT IF THE CHARGER (WHICH THEY DONT KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GET) DOESNT WORK THEN CALL THEM AGAIN!THEY ALSO TRIED TO MAKE ME PAY FOR A NEW CHARGER!I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS UNIT TO MY WORST ENEMY.CUSTOMER SERVICE STINKS, AND SO DO THIER REPS.JUST WARNING YOU ALL, BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS DUE TO ALL THE ""SHINNING REVIEWS"" ITS NOT WORTH IT IF IT DOESNT WORK."
4,Strong little vacuum; wish it had a wall bracket,"The little green Shark has been great for general pick-ups and good for pet hair (the little beater attachment works well, although it clogs often with the hair from our longhaired cats, meaning that I have to remove the two screws that hold the beater unit together and cut and pull the hair off the spindle.) Like other users, I do wish it came with a bracket to hang it on the wall."
2,Think twice before buying,"This unit does a very good job, however, do not expect it to last. The battery lasted about 1 1/2 years, after following all charge/recharge instructions very carefully. It was never left on the charger, and it was never recharged until it was nearly discharged. It was used on a regular basis and never in storage. Perhaps 1 1/2 years is an acceptable period for battery life, but the outrageous cost of the replacement ($36 including shipping) renders this absurd. Yet another throwaway."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER,"NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER, CONTACT YOU SEVERAL TIMES AS WELL AS THE SELLER, NEVER RECEIVED ANY RESPONSES. I ALSO PUT IN A CLAIM - WHICH WILL NOT LET ME KNOW ANYTHING UNTIL FEB. TOTALLY DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR SERVICE"
4,Nice Hand Vac,"The hand vac is working great so far. We read the instructions on how to charge and discharge the battery as well as other reviews on this subject and to date the battery holds up Great. The only disappointment is that the color of the vac we received is not the green one that had been pictured, but rather grey. Other than that the vac came to us in a very timely manner and overall I would buy it again if I was choosing today."
2,"Good, to a point","The good: this lightweight vacuum doesn't have any consumables (like bags). It has plenty of pull for light use on dry messes.The not so good: This sucked up a dust-bunny just a bit bigger than it could swallow, and it choked. That blocked the one-way intake valve half open, and it threw up some of what it had swallowed earlier back onto the floor. Yuk.The conclusion: Good, up to a point, but don't assume it will handle a car floor's worth of sand and grit. Save the heavy lifting for a bigger tool.Update after using it a while longer: Downgraded from three to two stars. The darned thing clogs easily and is tedious to unclog. Dust-bunnies aren't the only offenders, but any house with animals that shed will want a tool with a wider throat."
2,Charging Stand \ Wall hanging unit no longer available!,"I bought this product based on the reviews, and I was aware that I was going to need to order the wall hanging unit separately. Called Shark today and found out that they no longer carry the wall hanging unit. Great vac, but not real convenient now that I can't hang it on the wall in my broom closet. Buyer beware!"
3,Too much filter changing,"I bought this vacuum to clean the cat hair off of my two fabric sofas. I only own one cat, and the shark did get most of the pet hair after 2-3 passes, but I had to take the filter and clean it out three times during one cleaning session. I found this to be quite time consuming, especially since the battery started to loose steam as I got half way through the second couch.Pluses: Will pick up cat hair and is cordlessMinuses: Filter constantly needs to be cleaned and the battery life is suspect."
5,Powerful and worth it.,"I bought this a few days ago and am impressed with how strong it is even on toughly woven rugs. Definitely a good investment. I don't usually review things I've purchased, but felt this one deserved it."
2,Not that good. Read on..,"Ok, after all of the fantastic reviews, I decided to get it. Since I am an owner of a husky that sheds a lot I was tired of all the hair on the furniture.My first impressions: this vac has some kick, yup, it does. It sucks pretty well, but thats about it. It doesn't pick up the hair very well. After reading the reviews I though it may be as easy as 123, but not really. You really have to work hard on getting the hair out, and even then, some are still left on the furniture material. I would never buy it to clean up pets hair. Maybe it is OK for small clean-up jobs around the house, but not for pets hairy mess.Also, with the motor head, the vac dies fast, I would say 7-8 minutes tops.THE WORST part about this vac is the messy filter and dirt container. You have to reach inside pull the filter out first, then empty the bin. Nasty, nasty, nasty."
1,Battery NOT COVERED Under 1 Year Warranty,"After 6 months of use the custom battery now fails to hold a charge. Called customer support and was informed that NO parts that are ""replaceable"" are covered under the 1 year warranty.Pretty pathetic product quality and the warranty effectively excludes anything that will likely fail in normal use and yes I followed the recommendations regarding how to optimize the battery charge.Works great other then that... Shameful support and warranty exclusions."
3,Picks up well but no charging stand,"A lot of power and does a great job of picking up what I need it to - however, it DID NOT come with a charging stand which is almost impossible to find"
5,Dog hair MACHINE!!!,"We received this product as a wedding gift and my husband and I love it! We have a dog that sheds constantly, and it works great for quick touch-ups in between vacuuming. We vacuum our bedspread with it about every other day!! The suction in this little vacuum can't be beat. The power brush makes cleaning furniture and even carpet a breeze. The only downside I can think of is the lack of a charging station. We've used this product almost daily since receiving it over a month ago. Would buy again over and over."
1,Not as pictured/described,The TARGET SV736 does not come with the attachments shown and described. All you gets is the one motorized brush.
1,I won't buy this again,"I had it for slightly over a year and used it occasionally only. Now it is broken. I cannot recharge the battery; the recharge indicated could not be on when the charger was plugged in. I called Shark and they told me to replace the battery. I got the new battery but it still didn't work. I called Shark again. The rep had a bad attitude. She told me to replace the charger or send it for repair for $30.00. I am not going to deal with Shark again. In summary, this product is unreliable and Shark does not stand behind their products."
5,The best on Polk I've ever read!,"For years I've been convinced that James K. Polk was one of our country's most effective presidents and most successful. After reading the two volumes by Eugene I. McCormac, I'm more convinced than ever. I rank Polk as one of the top six (6) presidents this country has ever had. He stated what he wanted emphatically, he fought hard to get them accomplished and in the long run, they were good for the country. It's so sad that his accomplishments were overshadowed by the pending slavery question and his own lack of charisma. Yet, he was great and I rank him along with Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln & Truman. Others would disagree I'm sure, but I believe I'm right. Thanks, McCormac, for such two fine volumes on such a great statesman. Peahillfm@aol.com"
1,This was free for Prime customers - and now it isn't?,"Love Monty Python, hate seeing Amazon randomly change prices in general on items [sometimes minutes after purchase]. Was really looking forward to watching some eps today. Starting to wonder if Prime is really worth it."
3,ok player,"good:-its very money saving get it for half the price as nano-it seems to play songs fine-small, nano sized-fm radio is easy to use-photos can be viewed on itbad:-manual is not easy to understand-should replace the tiny screws with something that would hold better-smaller headphone jacks so its harder to replace-USB cord is hard to plug into the player-you can only use one application at once (cant play games and music at same time)-the front of the player looks quite cheap-mini disk that comes with it is half in chinese"
4,good gun,"I bougt this gun at GANDER MOUNTAIN for about $120, and it had a nice scope. BUT, it was to awesome! >:oI'm glad you were able to fing this AWESOME review AWESOMELY helpful. TO AWESOME! TO AWESOME!"
4,Powerful Break Barrel Air Rifle Not As Accurate as Pump,"The air rifle is powerful, but it is not as accurate as my old Crossman pump pellet rifle. The item shipped quickly and in good shape."
4,Exactly what i was looking for,"Like the title says this gun is exactly what i was looking for. I have a slight rat problem in my backyard and its pretty fun sitting out on my deck and pickin them off. Drawbacks, like a lot of people have said its a little loud at first but quiets down, the adjustable sights are something that took a lot of tinkering with, just couldn't seem to get myself zero'd in. Those are the only bad things i can say about the gun really, for the price I paid for it I'm very happy."
4,For the price this is the best air gun out there.,"This is a great little gun, fast accurate and fun to shoot. This morning i killed my first possom with this airgun, i don't know how many i've shot before, but this is the first kill with an air gun. I'm very pleased."
5,"Excellent gun for the price, very powerful!!","I am truly impressed with this air rifle. All the multi pump guns dont even come close to this. Very powerful, i took care of a rooster we had with one shot to the back of the head. The pellet went straight through, and the rooster was motionless in less than 2 minutes. I have a 4x32 scope mounted on it and it is acurate within about a 4 inch diameter from 30 yards. I honestly do not believe you can get a better all around air rifle than this one for the price."
3,The Phantom,"The Phantom was delivered as advertised. It has not been as accurate as I had hoped. Even when secured in a stable shooting platform the performance is not consistent. If I were the only shooter, I would question my abilities but other shooters have had the same accuracy issues."
2,My experience with this rifle.,This rifle was a lesson in frustration for me. Has a nice feel and look to it and shoots with good power. The shooting cycle is decent for this price point but it was a inconsistant shooter. Started out showing promise and then gradually turned ugly. Been at this hobby for years and tried every trick I know trying to get consistant accuracy but nothing worked. Lubed cleaned and tuned still underperformed . Even tried a GRT II trigger up grade and still disapointed me in the accuracy department. For the record this was my second example I took the first one back. I have run into this before with Crosman air rifles and it frustrates me I could not solve the problem. Fortunatly I have lots of other air rifles to shoot and a couple of up graded Crosman CO 2 pistols I enjoy shooting so life is good. If you buy it I hope you get one from a good batch. I know they are out there.
3,Shoots Well - Back Sight is Bad,"The gun shoots well, is sturdy, and overall very nice. Will kill small birds, squirrels, etc with little problem and from pretty good range. I killed 8 pigeons about as fast as I could load it at about 20 yds. Its not loud like a real gun, about like a hammering a nail. Either way its not loud enough to scare pigeons in a barn on a clear spring day.The rear sight is appallingly cheap. If you buy this gun plan on replacing it first thing. Not only is it plastic but the sides can catch on the barrel when you cock it if you arent really careful. Seriously, be prepared to replace the back sight as soon as you can."
2,would be good,well it is a very sturdy well bult gun and it is at a cheap price....i bought this about 5 weeks ago and it lived up to its power but accracy was horrable no matter how you adjusted the sights it always went to the left...i used a gun vice sighter and it still was not accurate...
2,not impressed,"A very, clunky, front heavy with light stock type of gun. Accurate once you sight in and then with the cheap sights, it falls out of accuracy. Mounted a scope, tightened well, and the scope creeped off and began to fall off the rear. I think there are better products out there but you are going to pay for them."
5,Awsome,I used to have a crossman 760 when I was a kid and 10 pumps would get you an amazing 650 feet per second.This gun uses the same caliber pellet but pushes it out at 1000fps and with great accuracy! I am having a lot of fun target shooting with this gun.
4,Phantom is OK for the price but..,"Phantom is not bad for the money but, there are much better break barrels.The open sites are terrible, who designed these things anyway?Did they ever try to use them?? I cut the front at anglesfrom each side up to create a Point so I could SEE the TARGET!It requires a scope mount with a STOP PIN so it will stay in place.The trigger is not even as good as cheaper guns, but it shoots...The rear rubber stock hangs up on your clothes and is aggravating.Also Destroyer .177 pellets are often too big to correctly fit in the barrel!Research further if you want a more satisfactory experience shooting pellets."
3,Metal Sights,"Almost sent it back to Manufacturer for defective metal sights. Adjusted rear sight all the way left, still hit target 3-4"" off. Went to Ebay & bought a used Crosman scope which sighted in great. Can't explain that one. Dead on target at 50+ft now."
2,Disappointed,"I was debating whether to get the Crossman Phantom or the Ruger Blackhawks. I started by choosing the former. Delivery was quick but I was disappointed to find the gun felt like a bit of a toy - much like a lower power version I had as a kid. Worst of all, the front sight was on crooked and the gun was basically impossible to aim. I called Amazon and they sent me a UPS label to return the gun and gave me a full refund - the most impressive aspect of the whole transaction. I bought the Ruger instead and will review it when I have had a chance to use it a bit. So far I seems like a better product for a comparable price."
5,"Great airgun for the price, actually pretty good for any price","I had another break action pellet gun but I ""temporarily"" lent it to a family member. Ten months later, it was apparent that it wasn't coming back. Rather than just automatically buying another of the same brand I did some research including reading the reviews here on Amazon. I figured the almost universal great reviews made this Crosman sound like a great deal, so I bought it.All of the good reviews are right, this Crosman is powerful and accurate. I was worried about what the trigger was going to be like based on the reviews but mine came with a decent and usable two-stage trigger.You won't go wrong with this one.BTW: I'm not a beginner, been shooting rifle competitions of various types for 20 years, do a lot of my own gunsmithing and all of my reloading."
1,I will never buy crosman again !!,This is the second Crosman gun I bought. The first one what 40 bucks and was horrible which is to be expected and this one did not come with the scope stop so the scope slides back and has so much recoil that it broke the crosshairs in a $60 scope. I hate the way the make their products.
4,Great for the price,"I bought this pellet gun for target practice and pest management. This gun is pretty accurate and cannot be beat for the price. The reason this gun only recieved four stars is because it is not quite as good as other air rifles such as an air rifle made by gammo; the sights aren't as good, the trigger is plastic, and the trigger pull is heavier. However, I like the double action trigger for target shooting.As far as small game hunting goes, this air rifle will have no problem taking down a squirrel, chipmunk, crow, rat, or any other animal of that size. You just need to use the right pellets. By using hollow point pellets, the effectiveness of this rifle is really increased. Overall, this is a great gun and it will work very well at keeping squirrels out of the backyard."
4,sweet for the money,"If you shoot your eye out it will be worth it.. loud gun, be easy around nosey neighbors, soubds like a .22, great frog gun non the less"
4,scope rail,somebody please awnser me on this people have been saying that the scope dosent stay sighted in becuse the scope moves back. Someone with this gun please awnser me
4,One of the most inspirational scores I've ever heard,"Ever since I saw a young Canadian man skate to this music during a Winter Olympics, I have not been able to get it out of my mind, and I hear it now and then as a theme behind various trailers for films still. Together with the score from ""Rudy"", ""Dragon"" is one of the most beautiful movie scores to come alone in a long while.I listen to this CD nearly every morning while taking my daily walks, and I have performed Tai Chi routines to it for 500 people or more and have had overwhelmingly positive feedback which I feel is due to the beauty of this music.If you're looking for an inspirational, upbeat, 'feel good' CD, I highly recommend this one."
4,Classic Movie Trailer Music,"The Dragon's Heartbeat is a great theme that's used in a lot of inspiring, ""Rudy""-syle movies' trailers. Or on those ""Celebrating 75 years of excellence with 20th Centruy Fox, or MGM or whoever"" montages that show all the best, most memorable scenes from your favorite movies. For that reason alone, Randy Edelman is awesome."
4,Philips HS500 Behind-the-Head Sport Headphones with Neckband,I have only owned them for a little over a month but the headphones are performing very well. I wear them at the gym in the morning while I'm running or lifting or whatever I'm doing. They always sound very good and I never have problems with shorts or static.
3,Doesn't fit as expected,"The sound is good, but I don't like the way it moves behind my head. They seem a little big."
4,Cool headphones,These headphones look really close to the picture. It has some nice features like a system to help keep the cord in good condition and the sound is good. Real good if you like a deep bass sound.The Price will help too.
4,old model that still remains in memory,"**story** the first pair of these i owned i bought from a friend at school in 11th grade, 4 years ago. i was amazed at how well they sounded. i remember i lost my first pair, bought some sony earbuds that disappointed me then rebought these brand new. i also remember them taking a little while to get comfortable compared to the first pair i bought which were already worn-in.*review* overall great headphones, they are durable, sound great compared to the several pairs of name brand mid-priced headphones ive gotten over the years and got packaged with cdplayers/ipodim going out to target (as of 1-21-09 still sells these, save $[...] shipping and buy in-store!) right now to buy my 3rd pair (i lost my 2nd..). im happy they still sell this model!they also have the exact same plastic main-piece as the Logitech Extreme PC Gaming Headset 980233-0403. i noticed because i've owned both products at the same time."
1,WRONG ITEM SHIPPED.,"I've had several pairs of these headphones that have lasted me ten years, but the time came to replace them, so I turned to Amazon. I was sent the wrong pair (a much cheaper model worth roughly half to a quarter of the price, depending on where you buy them). Not only did the pair break after two weeks of use, but I spent nearly $30 with one-click ordering! Save your money and find these headphones elsewhere."
1,Sending out the wrong headphones!!,"The only seller offering these is sending out HS520 (instead of HS500), these sound terrible!"
5,Great Purchase,"These headphones are comfortable, have great sound, are durable, and affordable! I don't think you can find a better value for your money. I am extremely pleased with these headphones which I use daily at the gym and office."
5,Impossibly good.,"I have no freaking idea how headphones of this caliber can cost this little money. These things sound extremely good, with rich bass and clear treble. Plus it has an elastic thingie to prevent the cord from being pulled, which is pure genius. Highly recommended!"
5,Best mini earphones around for the money.,"I just got a pair of these for Sixteen dollars delivered from an amazon.com vendor partner. I can't say enough about how good they are - especially for the low price! Great bass and mids, adequate highs, VERY confortable and they stay in place. What more can be said?"
4,good sound and light weight,"The HS500 sound pretty good for wrap around headphones and they are very light weight... you can almost hardly knotice that they are there.My only problem with them is that after about an hour or so if your not carefull to put them on juuuust right they pinch your ear.It's a weird pinch tho because it only begins to hurt me after I take them off.But like I said, if you move them around a little and get them comfortable it really isn't to much of a problem."
1,No Treble,"Based on all these great reviews here I bought a pair. I tried numerous regular CDDA CD's and MP3's, mainly playing hard rock and heavy metal. Didn't matter what I played, the treble was practically non-existent and couldn't be adjusted/equalized properly. Bass and mid-range were very good, but NO TREBLE. Next, they wrap around you ears via a hard plastic earpiece that can't be adjusted. Tried them for 45 minutes, and my ears were really starting to hurt. This is my 2nd attempt to try Philips headphones and last. Tried those HN100, Philips Noise Cancelling headphones, and they had tons of distortion. Philips makes excellent DVD players such as DVP642, great TV's and great CD/MP3 players, but they can't seem to make great headphones!"
4,Excellent value,I was looking into buying either these or the sony street headphones. I noticed that these have a larger freq. response and greater sensitivity when looking at the specs. They were also cheaper than the sony's so I thought I'd give them a shot. I think they are WELL worth the price. The sound is awesome and I do not find them uncomfortable at all. They also look really cool. I would recommend these to anyone.
4,"Good for price, but might be worth spending a little extra","At the time I am writing this, these are only $7.49. I rated it the four stars because the sound and comfort are pretty darn good for that price. However, I have been able to compare them to the KOSS KSC75's that I bought this week, too. The sound and comfort on the Koss far surpasses these for only $5-6 more. I recommend the upgrade if you are a heavy ear phone user like myself.To those who have had problems with the sound, I hope I'm not insulting you by asking if you've adjusted your equilizer's? I have found that adjustments were required with both these and the Koss' to achieve even good sound. Even the Koss' sounded awful with my MP3 player's factory default settings."
5,Some great cheap headphones,"These headphones are excellent for the price. I just got them to accompany my new laptop coming soon. I tried them out and wow. I was actually stunned at the bass. Very clear.Only two things that annoyed me with them. Sometimes my left ear hurts after wearing them. It's not horrible but still a little uncomfortable. And I cut off the ""pull relief"" cord. I found it annoying and ugly.Beside those two problems, if your looking for cheap headphones these are your best bet. They are sturdy and have an excellent sound."
4,Philips HS500 Headphones,"These headphones are pretty cool, and the sound is awesome. The only problem I have with them, is that when you wear them for more than fifteen minutes, they really make your ears sore. Other than that, they're great."
1,"Wrong item, again.",Just as few people before me I also got HSH5200 (much worse headphones) instead HS500. Target or Amazon refused to give any compensation.
1,Private listening?,"If you want to share what you are listening to with all of the people around you, these should do the trick. They have incorporated the brilliant idea of channelling the sound to the outside environment as well as into your ears. Now you no longer have to buy two sets of headphones when you and your loved one want to listen to music together. Or when a stranger approaches you on the street and wants to know what you're listening to, you no longer need to pass the headphones over! The music is everywhere!Enjoy the great sound and hope that your neighbors have musical tastes that are compatible with yours.As a small negative side note, the band is not adjustable and these things might move around uncomfortably when you move your neck up and down."
2,it's ok,it's ok to begin with. but it starts to hurt my ears after wearing them for over 10 mins... I thought it'd be more comfortable
4,"Good sound, comfortable and reasonably priced","These are excellent headphones for the price.Sound quality is very goodThe headphones are comfortable, unlike the earbuds which I find to be painful. I like the fact that these go behind the neck rather than on top. The headphones are not adjustable, and they feel like they may fall off my head (and I have a big head...LOL), but the ear clips keep this from happening. My plan is to use these during exercise (walking/biking) and I'm concerned that they may move too much when I do....we'll have to see.Purchased at Target store (I didn't have the patience to wait fo shipping), and at $15, the price is definitely right!!Good choice for the money.enjoy"
5,WOW cheap price yet awesome quality,These headphones are awesome. When I got mine they were $12 and now they are even cheaper. They cover more than the range of human hearing. The sound quality is better than many $50 headphones. Really the sound quality doesn't get any better than this unless you start cancelling out noise that isn't coming from your headphones. Like people talking in the room. Really if you wore tight ear muffs over your headphones they would sound just as good as the $100+ that are on the market.These are also very durrable. They have this little bungie cord on the end so when you accidently jerk the cord it doesn't break. And that kind of stuff happens once and a while.The only bad thing about these headphones is that the bar goes behind your head so you can't lean your head back. They aren't really comtorable but they don't get uncomtorable.Just an awesome pair of headphones for an insane price.
4,Good Headphones,"These headphones are a good value for the money. They look good, work well and feel just fine."
3,A French housewife,"The movie is in French, which I was not aware of when I rented it, however I was able to turn English subtitles on. This drama takes place in the 1930s and is from a Belgian filmmaker. It is unfortunate that she doesn't leave her husband as he is abusive and controlling. The film is not rated, but would probably be rated R."
5,Reiki Master Attunement,"Great dvd. For those of use who can't go to classes because either we can not afford them or can not get to them, it is perfect. Does everything it promises."
5,Powerful Attunement!!!,Very Powerful Attunement. This attunement with the Master symbol has increased my Reiki. My whole family notices the difference. I recommend this when you are ready. I have now taken all three of Steve Murray's attunement programs and happy and pleased with all three.
2,Reiki?,"It is a very peaceful tape/CD but I do not ""see"" how someone could actually get an attunement JUST by viewing this"
1,This is so cheap,Nice meditation. That is about it. This is probably the lousiest Reiki attunement one can possibly get. I did not feel anything. Why not get a real Reikimaster teacher to attune you in person. Also it is totally foolish to think you can become a Reikimaster from a CD. I don't see how Murray does other than exploit and debilitate the beauty of Reiki this way.
2,Umm...,"I don't feel any different. My reiki is still the same, my Pranic healing is excellent. I think it comes from within. Big disappointment not seeing Steve doing the symbols on the screen."
4,reiki master attunement,"i liked and i felt good during the viewing ,I'm already a reiki master,but i ad a good feeling about it"
5,Powerful healing to come from this attunement,I have been doing hands on healing on and off for nearly 20 years. I took this attunement for the first time 6 months ago (I had Reiki I and II in a local shop and then moved) and have taken it again several times since then. I did my first healing since taking the attunement a few days ago and the energy was amazing....it poured from my palms and shot from my fingertips....I did not even use the symbols for this particular healing. I highly recommend this dvd for your Master attunement if you had training and attunements elsewhere and want to finish up and become a Reiki Master it is perfect and the healing is most wonderful! Steve Murray really knows Reiki.
5,Rossi's masterpiece,"Phenomenal perfromance by Rossi, a gripping encounter with the healing power of Christ"
4,Nice product but hows the lifespan?,This is a repeat of the same item I had already been using. Made in China. 5 year life span isn't what they say it is. Looks and preforms as stated but not expected to last as long as former American made detector.
5,sue,I have not had to use this product thank goodness. But light was bright and it feasted fine so hopefully it will hold up in a fire like it says it will. Everything it says it did so far.
1,did not work,I could never get the alarm to work. I tested it after inserting the battery and the light came on but the alarm did not sound. I contacted first alert and was told they are only the on line distributor for the product.
2,Fire alert,"These have been a great disappointment!! My TV remote of all things can set it off in the den. Near the bedroom the florescent light sets that one off, lol. Not funny at 3:00am let me tell u. I kept the one in the Den after repositioning it further from the light source the remote still very rarely sets it off but oh well. The bedroom one we gave away with a warning I hope - but no it had to go! Bought a simple replacement and intend to do the same from now on."
3,Good recipes but needs pictures,"I collect cookbooks and love to find ones with great recipes as this one does. However, it needs more illustrations or graphics."
4,Cookbook,This book has joined my collection of teatime cookbooks and the recipes I've tried have been good. Nothing like a good cup of tea and a treat!
4,Nice Addition to the Cookbook Selection,"This book is cute and has quite a few recipes, and so far the recipes I've tried have been good. What is preventing me from giving it 5 starts is there seemed to be a lot of recipes for sweets in this book, and I would have liked to see more variety in the recipes, or more tea sandwhich recipes."
3,Gift basket filler,I bought this as a gift for a friend who loves to bake. It's a small book with no illustrations but the recipes are easy and delicious!I only wish it had some pictures(I am just more visual) to have in my mind what the end product will look like. It's a great gift or a reference book for when you feel like making some snacks for tea parties or an evening get together.
1,Only choose if you are REALLY just beginning,"I am 59 years old and in pretty good shape. Recently, I have been working overseas and have not wanted to purchase a gym membership. Liking yoga, and dance, I decided to purchase this DVD to bring with me overseas, hoping it would give me a reasonable workout. I might as well have been reading, because that is about how much work this video takes. If you are older and just starting out, it probably is a great starting point, but other than that......"
4,anti-aging,"It's a pretty good workout tape. It's more of a strenghthening and toning work out. I'm not really crazy about the flowery words she uses, but this is just a personal preference. Also, the floor exercises I find somewhat aggravating - because I have to stop and see what they are doing - it puts a strain on my neck trying to watch. Sometimes I just sit there till they get in position and then do the same. But, I find I have to do this in other exercise tapes too. It is kind of a low stress, feel good tape, and it does make you feel energized, for the most part. If you are going to buy an excercise tape, this is a good place to start."
5,Carol Argo's Anti Aging Method,The Anti Aging Method by Carol Argo an excellent exercise video. It is very easy to follow and moves smoothly from one exercise to the next. I could do every exercise the first time through and I didn't feel stiff or sore the next day. You get a complete head-to-toe workout and each section holds your attention without getting repetitious or boring. It is one of my very favorite workouts!
5,Get Ready to be Energized!,"Get Ready to be Energized! This DVD is a total body workout with a beautiful setting and easy to follow choreography. The variety of genres make it fun and invigorating, making this an inspiring and complete workout. This DVD is a fusion of movement style. you will experince the expressiveness of Dance, the precision and grace of Pilates, the concentration of Tai Chi and the dynamic poses of Yoga. it will leave you with a sense of well-being that filters into evry aspect of your life. You will love it!"
2,Not impressed !,"I am in my mid 40's and only exercise lightly once to twice a week. Although I am not considered active at all, most of the movements in this DVD were way too slow and easy for me. I'd like to re-visit this DVD 10 years later for it might help me then."
4,Perfect for getting things loosened up!,I'm 47 and have back pain so keeping active is important. I got Carol's video about six months ago and love doing it on those days when I'm feeling extra stiff. It's easy movements are safe on my joints yet I will work up a sweat doing it. I wish she had a series of these...I would buy them all!
3,Just okay - better suited for older women,I feel I waited too long to return this video since I spent over $20. It's just okay -- I would not pay more than a few $ for it. It's kind of slow and the 'free-form' parts were not really needed so much. It's just an okay workout for beginners (which I still consider myself) and could probably still use if you're intermediate or just lots older than me (50's).
4,Tired Of waiting,"If anyone wants this cd and is tired of waiting for Amazon to get it in, Tower records has it in stock for a cheaper price."
4,Nice little case,"I would recommend this case for your Panasonic camera. I took it on a trip to Europe recently and it worked perfectly. I wore it on my belt, which kept the camera easily accessible without having to worry about putting it down somewhere and forgetting it. It fits and protects perfectly, the price was right, and it weighs almost nothing.I didn't give it the full five stars only because I would have preferred better quality leather - picky, picky ..."
2,Panasonic Lumix Camera Case,This is a very poor replica of a real one. Construction is shoddy. The closure do not work properly.
4,"Nice quality, be sure to check inside dimensions vs. your camera","A very nice, but quite small, case, easy to open with the magnetic catch. Good quality materials. It is not padded, but should give adequate protection for regular use. Not waterproof nor particularly shockproof."
3,Interesting artifact,"My mother told me that she saw this film in a Black rural church in the 1940s, so I had the pleasure of watching it with her and reliving her memories. It's interesting in that it's a morality play based on a Southern Black version of themes of the afterlife and salvation. Spencer Williams (who also directed and is best remembered as ""Andy"" of ""Amos and Andy"") also provides some comic relief. While it is not likely to be taken seriously today by anyone aside from rural funamentalist Christians (due to the dialogue and extremely low budget), it is still very interesting to watch."
5,"fabulous, a must see",post-modern vision of the surrealist commentary. a deliniation of pre-byzantine cutlery mixed with class struggle/psychotic view of the protestant work ethic.
1,This is garbage.,This is garbage. Advertised as die cast metal - the shuttle itself is metal but the cargo doors are a cheap looking fragile plastic. This product could be a poster child for products made in China intended to make American children cry. It is a quick breaker and a design joke. In three days three separate parts broke off. I ought to get my money back.
3,OKAY,"All of these reviews about this toy are WRONG. I got this for my grandson and he loves it. The only cons are the bay dors witch are cheaply made and weak plastic, and the SRB'S do not come off. I give it 3 stars because of quality and durability.This is a good toy,not the best but, cool. folding gear to canadarm it has it all!"
4,Beautiful but less detailed handicraft than pictured,"The stadium lacks texture and from picture, I thought that it would be more detailed handicraft. I also did not get a certificate of authenticity from seller. But overall it looks nice, and makes a great gift for NFL fans in New England. I also found the display case to be a bit overpriced but these limited edition collector's items usually are often so."
3,Signing flash cards,With my son recently diagnosed with an ongoing hearing loss it is very important that we learn ASL as soon as possible. These cards make it easy for my son to learn new words every day and review the basic words and numbers he uses to communicate daily.
4,In The Line of Duty 3,"I started out watching this series backwards so i seen part 4 before i seen this one and it really doesn't compare. Yuen woo ping choreographed In the Line of Duty IV so its a no brainer that it would be way better than this. I mean you could get up and go to the bathroom and not miss much. The best thing about this movie is the ending fight scene. The robbers in the movie are really good and just for some reason always have machine guns on hand. They are really tough fighters for the police to go up against and they usually spray up the whole place with like Mac 11's in every scene they're in.Pros: Ending fight scene, Robbers.Cons: At times it seems more of a drama with not enough action for me, Some of the dumb things police do in the movie.Its a must have if you are collecting the series from when Michelle Yeoh was doing it. I'll give it 4 stars cuz i like the series."
5,Perfect for a fan,"I bought this book in Boston when I was in eighth grade, back in the mid eighties. At the time I was really into the Sex Pistols, and things like this book were hard to find. The book is basically comprised of photographs and newspaper clippings, beginning with the birth of the Sex Pistols, with Glen Matlock, up until Sid's death and Johnny's next band, Public Image, Ltd. If you want to see the actual photos and learn about the band, then this book is for you. I know that there is a lot of Sex Pistols stuff out there right now, but this book is really worth getting. All the legendary stuff is in here, including pictures from the infamous Bill Grundy interview, where you can see a very young Siouxsie Sioux. If you're into the Pistols, buy this book."
4,Interesting expat perspective,"All I'll say is that the author had the patience (or stubborn-ness!) of a saint! After reading about her experiences with the religious police, what tourist would WANT to go there if they could?"
2,Needs updating,This book needs a major overhaul. Information and photos are out-of-date. Very superficial information for anyone on the verge of buying and building. Printing quality is very poor -- some of the photos are so dark they are indistinguishable - copier quality in fact. For the first time ever -- I sent a book back for a refund.
2,The Movie is an incomplete copy.,"I was expecting to see the entire original film as I had seen on regular television in the 70's. Disappointed that some of the film had been edited out. Still, I wish the Studio which owns this movie would release it to DVD in its entirety.."
2,Cliched to the Hilt,"I find the story of Lupe and her growth into a woman cliched and overly predictable. Viilasenor is talented at description, but the plot leaves much to be desired. Beyond the opening fable, I could have slept through the rest. This is the literary version of a chick flick."
3,"Genuine story, translation lacking","A genuine story recommended by a Latino friend who is determined to have ""gringo"" friends understand his cultural ""genetics"". The story does well to portray history, family, culture, thinking...but the English translation seems a bit thin linguistically in a book that would be well served with rich language. Still worth the read."
5,History of two Mexican family's journey to the United States,"This lengthy book is a great historic reference of twodifferent family's. A girl's family and a boy's family.It is full of special moments for the families. A new home,a new language, a new culture, and a new freedom. Later,the girl and boy meet, and this brings the two familieshistories to start a new history. This book is full ofmany hardships, joys, and most of all a type of suspense."
3,My opinion of Rain of Gold,"It was entertaining reading however I felt that the author put the characters in a much better light than what was the truth. For starters he made his father look like an honest businessman when to me I felt he was a 1920's version of Tony Montana.Anyone who goes around carrying 2 guns (one an automatic) was certainly not planning to use it for self defense but rather a shoot out probably with the law. His propensity to quickly pull one out to use it if he didn't like what you say or did only reinforced that feeling. As for his mother, well again I find it hard to believe that someone could go through the whole story with their ""head in the clouds"". I don't think that there was anything magical about how the author's parents got together like he would like everyone to believe. In probability the girls mother most likely didn't want her marrying an american and they probably were impressed by Juan Villasenor's flaunting of his money with expensive cars and clothes."
5,Rain of Gold,"Villasenor is an excellent storyteller who totally involved me in the tale of his family. I feel as though I know his family, and feel a sense of loss as the book comes to an end. I have ordered another of his books to fill the void when I complete Rain of Gold."
2,Not so good.,"I read Macho and thought it was an accurate, honest book. It was very good. I enjoyed it. Someone recommended Rain of Gold, so I started it. It starts out interesting and enjoyable and then goes sour. Senior Villasenor weaves a tale I just don't believe. It gradually turns into a 'blame it all on the Anglo and Bad Mexicans' story. He can't find anything good or even understanding about these 2 peoples. Apparently he does this in an attempt to excuse some of his relatives who were involved in organized crime ( naturally because of the Terrible Gringos and the Worthless Mexicans ).I finished over half of the book, which was difficult. I suspect that the rewiews for this book are invalid (author, family write-ins).It's your typical 'blame it all on the Anglo' (and in this case 'Bad Mexicans' who are any Mexican-Americans Senior Villasenor doesn't like. This is a pity because Macho was an very good book. Hopefully the author will resolve some of his issues.Barry Coe."
1,This book is horrible,"This is the most biased book I've ever read. I can't believe I have to read it in school - it's a big hogwash of Judeo-Christian bias.The author forces his religion on the reader. It might as well be the Bible, which is the big reason I can't believe I have to read it. What happened to the seperation of church and state?ANyway, he goes into too much detail. Who wants to hear about digging through horse manure to find seeds to eat? It's fine when he talks about Socorro giving birth, but when he constantly likens it to 'taking a huge caca,' he's going too far. Someone needs to get better at writing. There are better analogies.I honestly believe that this book should be outlawed as required reading for high school. It is not great literature. It's horrible Judeo-Christian BS, and it's not even written well. Not to mention it's disgustingly detailed."
5,astounding true-story about real life,"Everyone shoul read this book, it gives people an understanding of the hardships that the latino immigrants had to face."
5,A well written account of true family love and survival.,"This book rates right up there with Buck's ""The Good Earth"" only better as it is dealing with our wonderful melting pot, The United States. Two family saga's as they struggle to obtain the American Dream."
5,"Made me laugh, made me cry...","When I was reading this book I sat for part of the time in a hotel lobby in Houston. I was alternately laughing and crying, until the concierge came and asked if I was ok. I replied that I was just great. Everyone to whom I have recommended this book has both laughed out loud and cried real tears.Why? Because this book illuminates the soul of the Mexican People, and the soul of humanity, in a way which speaks to the hearts of all of us. Love between people, whether a man and woman or a parent and child, is depicted herein in a way which we all aspire to.The people of Mexico have borne much - the stories in Rain of Gold of the civil war in the 30s describe the horror which the people went through in a way which is difficult for many in the US to understand. The description of the suffering and the dignity of the people in Mexico clarified for me why I have so much respect for la gente de Mexico.Villasenor has done us a great service, and provided a terrific read."
5,A mystical struggle for survival through harsh times.,"Victor Villaseñor's own family tells this beautifully writtenstory of poverty, immigration, struggle and success.The book focuses on three generations of Villaseñor's kin,their spiritual and cultural roots back in Mexico,their immigration to California and their overcomingpoverty, prejudice and economic exploitation. The mysticismso prevalant in the Hispanic culture is woven throughout."
3,decent,"In the beginning Doña Margarita wouldn't lay a finger on her boy Juan. But towards the end, Juan's perspective tells of how he is fearful of how she used to beat him, and how little Jose and little Pedro's testicle squishing episode reminded him of how his mother used to punish him. Then he's getting his ear pulled on, like she used to do all the time. However, like I said, in the beginning of the book the author explains in detail how Sal's mother wouldn't lay a finger on him, despite Luisa encouraging her to straighten him out. At first I read into it that she might be losing her mind in her old age, but then he goes into the family details of how it was common practice for her to abuse him.This was a good read! But I felt like some editor probably forced in some crap. Parts of story got twisted. Ending was pretty boring."
4,"great violin, not so great bow","actually I'd rate it 4.5, love the fact I got 2 bows, but sadly(only tried one so far) the rosin didn't stay on well, but the violin is well worth the price.The case is nice, the violin is a bit small but it works very well with my petite frame. the wood, nice and sturdy but pretty light. the extra G cord was a surprise."
4,Important book,"A lot of people think Linux is bullet proof, but its not. If not configured correctly, it can be just as insecure as Windows.Hardening Linux is an important book in that it shows how to harden Linux to be very secure."
3,Nothing New,Anne Sophie is among my favorite violinists and she is nothing but excellent throughout this whole cd. But the recordings are pulled from previous releases. The Carmen sequence suffers badly from the recording and contains the identical flaws that the original release did on her previous Carmen Fantasy cd. As an introduction to ASM I recommend it. Her playing is as great as ever. But you will not find anything new here and the recordings are less than stellar.
2,Johnny Starlight,"Having read this book to my son I found that Johnny Starlight does not live up to the hype mentioned by her publisher or in these reviews. The subject matter is a delightful one but Erika V. Queens use of rhyming verse [His name was Johnny Starlight. He was a starborn boy. And wherever Johnny went, he would fill young hearts with Joy.] is more of the same and runs too long [26 pages] to hold the attention of not only young readers but older ones also. Agreed, this writer uses a flowing style here and the illistrations are colorful, Johnny Starlight is an offering that tends rely more on hype than actual content. This writer would do well to fine tune her work before releasing another chidrens book."
2,Poked me...,I didn't really like this ring. It was much bigger than it looks and had big hard prongs around the jewel and will poke your belly button...
3,"A tragedy, but not a scandal","I'm sorry to say this, but if this book purports to be anything but fiction, it is misleading potential readers. The Normandie was not sabotaged by anyone. The fire that destroyed it was a stupid accident, nothing more. I say this on the basis of studying more than 2,000 pages of FBI reports which I personally obtained under the Freedom of Information Act while writing my book ""Normandie, Her Life and Times."" It was my great hope that there was some scandal, some crime, some sabotage, but none of these words apply to the Normandie's fate. I have read literally dozens of direct eye-witness accounts and they agree with the way the fire and the later sinking occurred. What I have said is not to be construed as a review of this book, only of the notion that some kind of scandal was involved in the Normandie's demise."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"This was, without question, one of the most depressing and boring books that I have ever read. I made the mistake of choosing this book for an analytical book report, and found it to be the most depressing choice I could have made. I wouldn't even reccommend this book to my worst enemy."
2,"""Rediscovered"" Film Somewhat Disappointing","This is one of those films you've heard about for 30 years and have never been able to see, until now. It has a small cult following in England (where it was shot). It concerns a lunatic living in a London subway, preying on commuters. The movie had a lot of potential. Donald Pleasance is terrific as a sarcastic police chief, the premise is creepy and the camera work is good. Yet somehow the film falls flat. When it's over, you'll say: ""That's it?"" The DVD has no extras. Director Gary Sherman runs hot and cold. His ""Dead and Buried"" is very good, but ""Poltergeist III""... need I say more? Fans of British horror will want this rarity to complete their collection, others beware."
3,CREEPY URBAN CANNIBAL MOVIE,"This movie is interesting in many ways. First, the story is really deep and well thought. The Cannibal character is not showed as some kind of BoogeyMan but more like a victim of his situation. He scares you but makes you feel sad at the same time, a lot like the Frankenstein's creature does.Then, you got Donald Pleasance and Christopher Lee in it and that's more than a good point. Plus there are some great scenes of macabre ( the Cannibal's room full of half devoured dead bodies will blow your mind !! ) and a litle bit of Gore too. To my mind, the only low point of the movie is the lack of action, that's why I don't give the movie more than 3 stars. But anyway, that's a great movie that any Horror Fan should add to his collection. Yes Sir !!"
4,A Horror Fan Must !,"""RAW MEAT"" is a slow paced but good little creepfest with chunks of unintentional silly humor scattered throughout wich mostly comes from it's outdated content,offbeat acting at times & clunky delivery of the score. With that said it does have plenty of that thick creepy 70's horror film atmosphere along with a couple of jumpy scares and some great ""gross out"" visuals. The execise of making the viewer grapple between fearing the mutant man or feeling bad for him was accomplished brilliantly in my eyes. I'm willing to bet that before shooting ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" Tobe Hooper definitely took some visual tips from the morbid tunnel dwelling of our sad villian from this film. I do consider this to be a little known lost gem and I'm very happy to add it to my collection. This disturbing little midnight frightfest definitely deserves a special little place in the demented heart of every true horror fan."
1,Don't buy these,The JBL EON 15 G2 is not a good sounding speaker & the design of them is very bad. They are made to just be thrown away when they break. Unless you get a REALLY good deal on them don't buy.
5,Culture SHOCK,"The book is certainly what I wanted, the advertizement was exact and the deliverywas efficient. RITA"
2,Redundancies galore!,"Where was the editor on this? The author repeats herself all over the place, even from one page to the next, and there are other editorial shortcomings (pg. 75: ""Poland and East Germany are contributing...""; hmmm, East Germany hasn't existed since long before this book was supposedly first published, which makes me think that the 2008 edition is a regurgitated 2001 edition, with even that being dated; pg. 86: ""spend together"" vs. ""spend time together,"" etc.) These are just a few of many such examples that take away from the content, which is overall quite good."
3,Most of the reviews are for the WRONG ITEM!!!,"Please be aware that this item is about young people during the Holocaust. Ten of the 12 reviews to date are about another DVD by the same title. Amazon, please fix this!!"
4,Horn sounds good,"The horn sounds good. Its a little tricky mounting it on the existing mount on the side of a Harley. I found using your braket from the old horn works best.It's not as loud as I though, but works better then stock Harley horn!"
1,fell apart,Put this on my CVO street gide and it looked nice but it fell short of quality from there.the sound was not as loud as the competing models that I put on my other bikes and the round chrome peice on the top fell off after only a few months later.My recommendation is to spend a little more money and buy one from a store where you can test the sound and have someone to return it to if it does start falling apart.
4,Good alternative to factory horn,"Willing to increase safety by installing a louder horn, this horn did the trick. The installation was simple and the horn outperforms the factory horn in my 87 Honda Magna; the dual tone sounds much nicer. Keep in mind that, as the manufacturer suggested, using the enclosed relay means that you will need to purchase 16-gauge wire to run the battery-to-horn circuit which will be activated by the motorcycle horn button."
3,wolo 519 Bad Boy air horn,"I love the idea of this item. I ride a Harley Davidson Road King and drive long distances. Last trip was to the West Coast and back. The horn works great but please check out the packaging before you open it. Mine was opaque and It clearly looked like new old stock and I could not see the item clearly and once the package is open it's destroyed, so returning it in the packaging is an impossibility. Mine had blemishes on the main body the ""plastic chrome"" appears to be peeling off and looks pretty bad. To return it would be more hassle and cost than it's worth. The horn is great but unless I was offered a replacement at no cost to me I would not bother to return it. It bothers me that this is the only thing on my motorcycle that looks bad. People look at the horn and try it. They love the sound but always ask "" What's up with the finish"" I always tell them to check the packaging well before opening. The horn is great but poor packaging."
4,Good Bad Boy Horn,"I ordered this horn for installation on a Honda Valkyrie motorcycle and I have to say it works and looks great. I mounted it to the front engine guard and it looks like it was meant for the bike. The only problem I had was the weak single bolt mounting bracket on the horn. I solved this by using epoxy putty to secure a bolt into the horn mounting bracket, then used the bolt for attachment to the motorcycle. The horn is super loud. Many time louder than the stock Honda horns on the bike. No problems with being heard in traffic now..! I haven't had the horn long enough to test it for long term durability, but so far it is holding up well."
1,Wolo Horn,"This horn would be fine if hidden under a car hood. The cover is chromed plastic, not chrome. The one I received already looked worn in spots and the seams looked like they were glued. Again, under the hood it might work fine and who cares about the looks. I sent it right back and would not put it on my Harley."
2,does not fit anywhere in a 2001 Goldwing,Bought this for my GW does not fit anywhere so put it on my truck...would have liked to put it on one of my other cars but no easy way to do that since it seems all horns are hidden now..and require a lot of work to replace. Sound was not that much of a improvement from my standard Found on Road Dead F150
2,Not very Loud,This horn isn't very loud. It would be if you could get the Juice it needs to it but the wiring is complicated and frusterating. I didn't think it was worth the money.
5,Wolo Compact air horn,"I am Very pleased with the Wolo compact air horn for my bike. it was very simple to install but did require a few additional electrical accessories to complete the wire harness. the horn was installed in about 20 minutes, sounds great and is loud, very loud. A great product for a great price.George"
5,Wolo model 519 bad boy air horn,"I bought one already and it sounded so good that i had to get another one,it's a great price and is very easy to hook up"
4,Wallo Bad Boy,This horn for the money is a no brainer to me much louder than Harley factory. Installed two months ago on my 09 Ultra Classic and have put 2000 miles and with heat and vibration has held up fine. Unit is plastic but well built chrome exceptable finish. Looks good on bike. Would recommend if not just for safety of people hearing me.
2,"Great horn, the good look just doesn't last long.",This horn sounds great on the motorcycle. In less than 1 year the 'Chrome Plastic' looks awful. I am very unhappy with the quality of the horn. It says chrome and not chrome plastic. The warranty is only good for 90 days. Go figure.
3,Longevity a problem,Simple install on my harley..unplug the original and plug in this one.....very loud and great but after a year starting to look funky and after about 20k miles it just died....maybe the vibration wore it out but I'm buying another one because it makes me feel safe to have a very very loud horn ....and that's worth it...
3,Wolo customer service is weak sauce.,"This horn sounds awsome. the look is good as well. I received it from amazon, packing was good, item in the origional packing, I opened it and noticed that the chrome at the seam on the front side of the horn was missing like it had peeled off. I contacted WOLO and after some arguing I was told they would send a call tag and check it out, they were told the exact problem. 2 weeks later I got it back in the mail, the exact same horn with the exact same problems, the warranty note said everything checked good. Really??? I even put a sticky note on it with an arrow pointing to the problem. anyway so I then called amazon, longer story shorter 5 min later and the replacement is going out today and the peely one is going back. Should have just delt with amazon in the first place.Thank you Amazon"
2,Disappointing,"We already had another live characters Hansel and Gretel DVD, which was destroyed by my 4 year old, so i got this and assumed it will be the same exciting story. It wasn't, they dont even watch it at all."
4,Another must for the Morgan (and Peace) collector,"This is one of the first references discussing Prooflike Morgan Dollars. It was published in the late 70's as an update to Wayne Millers ""An Analysis of Morgan and Peace Dollars""He delves into the differences in the minting standards between the different mints as well as the minting process itself. He also lists each date (and mint) and discusses the relative rarity of prooflikes (and regular strikes). Although the prices are way outdated, the information is still very valuable. Mr Miller was one of the first to create a very high end Prooflike collection. As for Peace dollars he discusses the typical strike etc. This is a must for the serious dollar collector from a reference information viewpoint, especially @ less than $100."
4,Better than plastic!,"Zorn's creation is fun to build, nice to look at, and fairly difficult to construct if you want to make it look good. The book contains 5 pages of pictures and info on the real plane and flight, and then it gets to the hard part. Mastering the skill of working with the paper is the first challenge. I learned that cutting with scissors is usually better than an X-acto knife when possible. Also, make sure to not use too much glue (I used Elmers) or it will warp the paper, and avoid getting gluey finger-prints on the outside. This is a great model of the Spirit of St. Louis but the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because there are some steps that are not illustrated very well and some creativity is required. Step 30, where the rudder is glued into the rear fuselage is one such step. However, the plane still looks great and the problems ""wouldn't be noticed on a galloping horse"" (except by the builder.) Buy it! and enjoy."
4,An interesting attempt,"Walter Korn was one of my favorite chess writers, although you also have to admit that most of what he did had deep flaws. He was, first and foremost, a storyteller. This is an attempt to place U.S. chess history up to the Fischer era in an entertaining context. As is usual with such attempts, there is significant glossing-over of what is really important and a sometimes slipshod approach to the facts (although there is little of the ""chessmaster running through the hotel halls naked"" sort of apocrypha), and unsupportable conclusions. But no one else has put together anything like this.It's a good read, just be aware of the potential flaws."
2,"Diverting, Not All That Engaging","Rambling, disjointed, speculative, and obscure in its account of American chess history, this book is useful at best as a companion to a real chronicle."
3,Gets the job done...kinda,Works great except you cannot transfer the voice memo files - just the photo & viseo (P207 rogers)E.S. Day
2,Too limited,This booklet makes a big thing of Lisbon colloquialisms and leaves you with the wrong vocabulary for other parts of the country like the Algarve. It is also unsuitable for other Portuguese speaking countries like Brazil. I would not recommend it to my evening class students.
2,Worst Installment,"This Middle Man title is actually more appropriate for In the Line of Duty IV. This movie starts out with a decent fight scene and its all down hill from there. Its more of a drama about people who are friends of friends in this movie. Cynthia Khan has a relative who has friends that are into some information smugglin and thats basically her beef to get into a lot of the action in this movie. Like others stated this film has very little to do with the original series theres absolutely no comedy as in other installments its a very serious drama and not enough action for me. I really stopped paying attention because of how boring this film was, i mean you can get up and go get something to eat and you won't miss much. This one doesn't measure up to the rest, If you want to watch a good ITLOD series i'd go for 4 or 2.Pros: Cynthia KhanCons: Too much drama, Not Enough Action, Fights were poorly choreographed, Story and plot were very weak."
5,A very important contribution to shamanic literature,"This book opens the door to a very personal look at shamanic journeying and the dance the journeyer does with power animals and guides, as well as expounding on the map of the three worlds and the inner connectedness between all. Yes, it is about a personal healing bravely and openly told, but more than that, it is very much about relationship to one's Higher Self and all our inner aspects in dreamtime. I highly recommend the companion guide be read at the same time as it sheds even more light on the very personal dance we create within the realm of Spirit."
5,Love this!,"This book is both a personal story and a story that will touch everyone's soul. Everyone has been hurt in some way in this life. Kelley Herrell does an amazing job of sharing her personal healing while showing how very important it is in the healing process for everyone that we are open to loving and forgiving those who did the damage as well as ourselves. Your path will be different from Kelley's, but we can all find our own path to being healed with this author's guidance."
5,Worked Nicely on a 2001 Jetta,This product did a fantastic job of restoring the color on my slightly oxidized blue 2001 Jetta. Very pleased with the product and will be following up with an NXT waxing as suggested by another reviewer.
5,Dacha: The Great Retreat (in all sizes).,"Dacha is derived from the verb ""to give.""Peter the Great gave to a select few the dacha experience. Downthrough the past three centuries the concept has had a many splendidmetamorphosis. Often, the dacha was hidden in a coppice of trees,not remote, but secluded.A radical break with urban routine, and therefore an opportunity toexperience a different pattern of life. There are no direct equivalents, particularly for styles of buildings. SUMMERFOLK meant, summertime in the country for people from big cities lastingapproximately two months.Stephen Lovell is a social and cultural historian and shows us with his Between City and Court, the Late Imperial Dacha Boom, the Dacha as a Cultural Space (1860-1917). the making of the Soviet Dacha (1917-1941), Exurban Life (1941-1986) and the Dacha Settlements in contemporary Russia.This is a first book of its kind. It truly presents a unique Russianway of life!Dag Stomberg,St. Andrews, Scotland"
3,Cute but not comfortable,"I bought these sandals last summer when they first came out -- they are so cute and go with almost any outfit -- but like most Steve Madden shoes, they are NOT comfortable. The sole is so flat and offers zero arch support. I generally wear them when I know I won't be walking around very much."
5,My favorite shoes!,"Buying shoes online is always a little worrisome for me--what if they don't fit? What if they rub? With the unique model this shoe has, I was especially worried that the top of my feet would be rubbed while walking. However, I am beyond pleased. There is no rubbing at all and didn't require any breaking in to get to that point. also, the Sannibel is fancy enough to wear with slacks while pairing well with jeans and shorts, too!"
4,Super comfy and more interesting than boring old flip flops!,"I've been wearing these all summer. They are very comfortable. I get compliments on them constantly. I didn't give it 5 stars because the gold began to wear off between the toes. It's not noticeable, and I have been wearing them almost constantly, so I guess a little wear and tear is OK!"
1,not what i ordered,I ordered the sandals with gold links and instead received ones with silver links... NOT what I wanted! I was very dissatisfied that there wasn't anyone to make sure I was getting what I payed for.
3,Item not as pictured,"I like these sandals by Steve Madden. I have them in several different colors, but I was expecting to get the sandals that were pictured, ones with gold links. Instead, I received ones with silver links. It was pretty disappointing. Now, how am I ever supposed to know if what I'm seeing online is really what I'm getting in the mail?"
3,Horrible Ending!,"I loved the book all the way through....but the ending is horrible!!!! Nothing happens! Check this book out from your local library, I wouldn't spend too much money on it. Maybe there will be sequel."
3,A beach read,"""Nothing but Trouble"" was ok, but nothing I would recommend. It's a light read, the kind of book you can read if you have nothing else to do.I didn't care for any of the characters in this story.Also a lot of the stuff that went on was predictable."
4,It is good but...,"We found this product at Amazon.com after looking at several music web sites. The major reasons for my son to pick this one are the price and color. My son's teacher said its quality is good. However there is no manual, warranty, or any written document inside the case, and the quality of the case makes us believe that it will not protect the instrument.We have contacted the seller by mail and phone for the document. The response is quick but not very helpful and friendly."
5,The funniest Marathon I ever did !,Thoroughly enjoyed Shulman's 26.2 tour of all 5 boros. Anyone who has ever run the NYCM will really enjoy this book. You will re-live your own run with Shulman running right along with you and laugh all the way. It is 26.2 miles of fun. Way to go Shulman!!
3,I wish Zweibel could just read it to me,"I liked the book...I guess...actually, It was just OK.I bought it because I saw the author on letterman doing a reading and he was freaking hilarious. He reminded my wife and I a little bit of David Sedaris.The problem was that the book took a really weird turn that it just couldn't come back from and it left me wanting more of the anecdotal asides from the main character and far less of what was ""The Other Schulman"" part of the story. I would maybe read another book by this guy, but I would want it more vigorously edited by someone who isn't his friend. He can clearly write and is a good storyteller, he just needs to be reigned in a little bit to make the story tighter.BTW, good luck actually finding this book...it is out of print and I had to wait 2 1/2 weeks for it...NOT worth it."
2,"Nice product, but completely misrepresented as to size","I have been looking all over the place for a strainer for the plug of my bathtub. It is a popup type. Per the dimensions advertised with this product, I was very hopeful it would fill the bill. Unfortunately, the seller listed this as a completely wrong size:Length: 0.50 inchesWidth: 4 inchesHeight: 5.75 inchesThese are the actual dimensions on the product delivered:Length: 0.85 inchesWidth: 2.70 inchesHeight: 1.45 inchesThis strainer might work on a very small sink of the old-fashioned type which uses a plug. In that case, you would turn it upside down and the small ""bowl"" part would fit in the drain. I'm not sure what else it might conceivably work for. It is too tiny to fit over any raised plug, and even if it did fit, it is too flat and hard to mold itself within a sink with curved sides, which most all have other than, perhaps, autility sink."
3,Sybex not as good as Oracle Press book,"I bought the Sybex Performance Tuning book. A colleague of mine bought the Oracle Press book. I read both and passed the OCP exam with plenty to spare. While the Sybex book is good, the Oracle Press book is better."
3,Bach's Symphony No. 1 in G,The above is the piece that was playing during the corranation. I know YoYo Ma has it on one of his CD's. It's beautiful.
3,Review and Question for Prince and Me Soundtrack,"The Soundtrck is great but I was wondering if anyone could tellme where I could find the song that is playing in the baackground for this trailer and is also in the trailer for ""13 Going on 30""It's something like ""If I could believe everything is alright"" and it a female artist."
4,Musical Score,"I have listened to all tracks and they sound really good but I really would like to know more about the main musical theme. Who composed it? Is there another CD available with scores from that composer, and in the same style? I like the songs but I'm really a music person, music has its own beauty, why ruin it with lyrics."
3,CORONATION MUSIC,"Sorry, as a cellist of 20+ years who was very moved by the use of the Bach Unaccompanied Cello Suite No. 1, that they used during the coronation, I just wanted to make sure people didn't go looking for Bach Symphonies (I'm sure it was just a oversight).The piece was written for solo cello and was orchestrated (very well I think) for the movie. I was also quite pleased they only took one small cut from the movement for timing. I don't think it's on the CD though. Please correct me if I'm wrong :)"
5,Good pillow,"I needed a pillow to have at my side while sleeping to prevent me from rolling onto my stomach and this pillow worked for that. Its a bit stiff but I don't mind that and I had a brookstone pillow before this one and loved it but since those pillows are not being sold anymore, I would recommend this pillow 100%. Also the shipping time took about 3 days!"
2,Lack of detail and description,"I own a 2001 SE 4x4 Pathfinder and bought the manual so I could replace the spark plugs and oxygen sensors, along with having it for other general vehicle repair info. As for the spark plugs, it was useless. It also has repair information for the frontier and xterra. Spark plug replacement provided detailed information based on an engine other than the pathfinder and directions were basically as simple as if all plugs were staring you straight in the face and all you had to do was unscrew and replace. As for the oxygen sensors, it is about the same thing. I would look elsewhere before buying this manual. In fact, that's why I'm here... I'm online now looking for different manuals."

2,"Okay flag, splotchy in places",The flag has red splotches in the white and white splotches in the red. It looks like I wiped semen and blood on the flag. Not what I wanted to hang in my room.
3,Cheap,I like to hang this flag in my barracks room to represent my home state. It is the right size and correct colors. It came folded very tightly and still has creases even though it has been hanging for a few weeks now. I tried washing it but it is just wrinkly now. Also the black paint is splattered into the yellow.
3,Maryland flag,Thin fabric but has held its color for a long time outside in the sun.Good deal at such a low price.
5,Gorgeous,"This is a gorgeous flag. It's a full 3 x 5 and I have it drapping down the wall of my ""ManCave"". It brings a lot of color to the room and constantly reminds me of my home state."
5,"Thrilling, Action Packed, You'll want to finish it for sure","This is one of the greatest batman stories ever written. I absolutely loved the way the story progressed and how you become attached to each individual character. It is an amazing tale of the Dark Knight, Dennis O' Neil did a magnificent job. If you like any of the movies or simply like Batman you will like this book. It is really great also because we get to see smart Bane rather then the big strong idiot depicted in the movie in the 90s. Unlike how the movie destroyed the character, this book digs deep into Bane's past. With every turn of the page you learn something new and I absolutely loved it. It's the kind of book I will read again and again, and enjoy it every time."
2,Lackluster,"Growing up, the original Knightfall saga was one of my favorite Batman story arcs. I figured that reading a novelization of the series would have provided deeper insight and more thorough descriptions that were not captured by the comic. However, just the opposite was true. The novel skipped a bunch of details and subthemes that I thought were important, and failed to provide anything to supplement the original series. Just one example that comes to mind is how only 2 chapters were dedicated to Lady Shiva's Tengu training. It's a decent read in itself, but does nothing to supplement the original storyline from the comics."
4,Fiery start.....dull ending.,"I loved the way this book started of with the primary focus on Batman and Bane. But as the book progressed into the middle, the main focus ""wandered away"" to a not so exciting plot and with this shift came an arid ending. All in all, it was a good read."
4,This is a classic among comic novels.,"I loved this novelization of the Knightfall saga. I do hope that its adapted into an animated movie, like Superman: Doomsday, another great book/story."
3,pieces missing or not needed,"Nothing against telling how interesting writing a book is, but a sizable chunk of the pages are made up of forword and afterword.As for the story, it remains mostly true to the story's general direction and actions. Unfortunately, it skimps on some battle details, and outright deletes battle sequences that were in the comics. It also had some changes noticealbe in lesser, but memorable details the comics had (like bane's confronting bruce wayne, Azrael confronting Bane)Plotwise, it entirely erased Nightwing's involvement altogether (Dick Grayson), a good chunk of Bruce Wayne's trials under Lady Shiva, and it also deleted the progression of Azrael's Batman suit changes (there were several incarnations and constructs, of which only one was truly Azrael's suit).If you are a story nut like me, you might reconsider, especially if you have to pay full price."
3,Good Introduction,This is a fairly good book for some one starting to use Analysis services. If you are a professional and are looking for a reference source then this is not for you. But if you just want something to help you get started... this is a simplified introduction with few useful insights.
2,CD is Virus Infected!!?,"I liked the book, but when I went to load the sample software called Proclarity, I got a message from Norton anti-virus that something was afoul in the install routine. Foolishly, I thought that Norton must be wrong. It turns out, I was wrong and the CD apparently had a virus or did something it shouldn't have done.Immediately after rebooting, my desktop disappeared after opening my first application. The mouse isn't working right either.So, the book is good. But don't load the sample software from Proclarity. Regarding the rest of the CD, I have not loaded it all, so I can't speak for whether it has any other viruses/problems. Just make sure you have your anti-virus software running. BTW, I'm running XP Pro."
4,Bought for vortex strikefire red dot optic,Tight very tight. I read in a gun fourm that this was the size to order for the vortex strikefire.I am not sure if this review will show my purchase and the size I bought. But if it does you might research the next size up on both ends. I think I bought the size 5 and 6 but not sure and I threw away the packaging.Beside the very tight fit they work just fine. I live in Alaska and no problem with the cold yet.
4,TV at work,"Great product would recommend for other people. Especially to watching games when at work, and not able to go next to the television at work. great for the desk in the office."
5,fastrax driver,"I was always playing the right side of the fairway or one fairway over, until I purchased this Fastrax driver, Now it's right down the middle!!!Thank You"
1,wrong,Your picture shows a 10 degree driver and it is a 10.5 driver. Anyone who golfs knows that is a big difference. I take notice you still have the same add. I would suggest you change it right away.
4,Taking Truth Next Door,"Faust's writing style is easy to pick up and hard to put down! He offers a contemporary apologetic for the Christian faith. He sets out to wrestle with some common questions people might have about Christianity like: Why does God allow good people to suffer, Is the Bible Really True, and other interesting but tough questions to handle. He uses a narrative style that simply tells the stories of ordinary people who have not so ordinary questions. For anyone who wants to investigate the claims of Christ and the Bible, Faust takes a simple and non-threatening approach. It's well worth the read!"
2,Two great scenes...,"I will give this movie two stars, simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing - at least once. The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead. It's so ridiculously absurd and campy, it makes me crack up every time I see it."
3,kinda funny/kinda scary,basicly more of the first movie but with more humor and less claustrophobia.
1,It stinks!,"DEMONS 2 provides more of the sames as part one except this time it's bloody boring. This time a demon pops out of the TV and gives a young woman the bug. Then she gives everyone else around the town the bug and then it all leads to complete nothingless. A big disappointment from Italian horror legends Dario Argento and Lamberto Bava, for real entertainment watch Argento's SUSPIRIA and Bava's BLACK SUNDAY."
2,D-TV...,"No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing..."
2,A solid step down from Demons,"A disappointing sequel to say the least. When first viewing Demons 2, I remember being upset wiht how it explained the end events of the first film. The first Demons ended with the Demon plauge spreading and the world on the brink of armageddon. Demons 2 begins with some cheesy explaination on ""how the human race beat the demon onslaught."" I was not impressed on how it explained it and it seemed to rush through it in order to get to the new story. After that we get introduced to the bratty Asia Argento at her birthday party. She gets possessed by a demon through her TV set(?) and spreads the contaigon to other members in an apartment complex. Lamerbto Bava's stylish direction is back and so are the special effects, bu the script just has too many holes and looses ends and the film seems to be editied by some knife weilding maniac. Sure it entertains to an agree, but it is a solid step down from the first film and it had the opportunity to be just as good or even better."
1,DON'T WATCH THAT MOVIE,This movie is one of the worst and terribley discusting horror movie I have ever seen. one of the most important turnoffs of the movie is that it was dubbed.I had to forward many of the boring and jucier scene( as the cover of the video proudly announced). and the idea of every one turning into demons made the story so boring.This movie is not worth any penny that I spent on it. Movie maker should not underestimate the audiance into making such movies in the future.
2,Not worth buying...,"I saw this in high hopes that it would be a good movie, since I've heard a lot about the director. Instead, it's just disturbing at some points and just stupid at others. It's good if you want to show it with other horror films and rent it, but I don't think that it's worth buying."
2,2 1/2 stars ! this is not the worst gore film eva made but not as good as expected!,"Lamberto Bava's ""Demons 2"" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! ""Demons 2"" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original ""Demons"" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!)"
5,Better Than he 1st,Demons 2 is better than the first in my opinion as there are more deaths and the effects are slightly better. Ill admit that the story line is a bit dodgy but they all were at the time that this film was released. There are more deaths in various different was with the demons havinf the full run of an apartment block containing flats offices and a gym. Any TRUE fan of the first will like the sequel and rush out and both it to complete the set
3,An okay movie,I ordered demons 1 and 2 a few years ago and i liked both movies but the only thing i dont like is that they use some of the same characters that was killed in the first Demons movies and they are also in the Second demons..ALIVE!!! WEIRD!!!
4,DEMONS 2 is Good Film -- Period!,"I love reading reviews where people say this film had ""bad editing"" ""plot holes"" ""bad acting."" Reality Check: This is NOT ""Gone with the Wind!"" This is a horror film that does not pretend to be anything other than it is: A cheesy film filled with gore and a lot of in-your-face action. In addition, for those who think this film was any worse than the first film -- whatever. Same story -- just a different setting -- Demons creating more demons. Truth is: This is a highly entertaining Italian film. It is far better than many of the sub-par Italian horror flicks that have graced the silver screen. Being critical of this film is easy to do -- as is frying almost any horror film. This film is a decent watch. It is worth every minute of its 93 minute running time."
2,"A comment on the April, 1999 correction","Lamberto Bava did a remake of Mario Bava's ""Black Sunday,""(La Maschera del Demonio) but to the best of my knowledge it is not yet available in the states.As for ""Demons 2"". It can be fun to watch, but it can stand with the best of Argento, nor the best of either Bava. Unfortunately, with the exception of ""Phenomena"" and ""Tenebre"", there are very few good Italian Horror films out on DVD. The best films of Argento, Bava & Bava, and Soavi have not yet been released on DVD.Hear that people at Anchor Bay?...I am waiting!!!"
5,Helpful book for PPD!,"After suffering through horrible PPD with my twins & then again with my son, I decided to be pro-active for my 4th & final child. I read this book & was prepared for the inevitable. I have to say that having a plan in place really helped! The book is most helpful if you read it BEFORE you have the baby, & BEFORE the depression hits. But even if you are in the midst of PPD, this book would be helpful for you or your hubs to read. I was ready for the depression by taking the steps in this book (have a therapist, be prepared for meds, I didn't have much extended-family support but I did prepare frozen meals etc. to make things easier) It was nice to not have to deal with horrible PPD with my last child, I wish I had read this before I had my twins!"
2,Great Hand Vac - but only for 1.5 years,"This dustbuster was FABULOUS... for one and half years. It picked up everything in its path! Including cheerios. The last 6 months it has barely held a charge and kicks dust out the back. Gross. If you want something short-term, this is a great machine! I see other reviewers have said the same thing. I don't feel like buying another one, it should have lasted longer."
1,Poor performance overall,The battery did not last more than a few months. It no longer holds charge for more than a few seconds! The suction even with full power was just ok. Agree with the other reviews that the filter gets clogged very easily. Not impressed with the product at all.
5,Hand Vac,I purchased it exclusively for my car mats and the small attachment gets the hard to reach edges and corners. It does not hold a charge too long and works much better when it is fully charged. I also recommend emptying the catch after each use. I'm now using it to pick up debris around the fire place.
1,DOES NOT LAST!,"We got this vacuum last year. I just threw it in the trash and am online to buy the black and decker! We were going to purchase the black and decker, but decided to save a few dollars and get this dirt devil. It worked wonderfully for the first 10 months. It now has NO suction power and won't hold a charge. My sister purchased the black and decker one 2 years earlier than us... and hers is still working GREAT! Don't waste your money on this particular vacuum. Buy a different one... the first time!"
2,Wall mount is a FALL mount!!,The vac has a big failing! The wall mount just does not work. I attached the mount to the wall and the vac simply falls out. Stay away if you need a wall mount!!!! Vac seems fine but it has a bearing noise when spinning down.
2,Dirt Devil,"Extreme Power Hand Vac, M0914 is a disappointment. The battery does not last long and the angle needed to do the job is awkward. The extension piece, which is built in, is useless as it does not stay in position. Would not recommend."
3,Average product,"Works well without crevice tool. If that is flipped out and extended, suction is not that good. The tool is not lengthy enough to reach out in between car seats and door."
3,Bueno,"No lleno mis espectativas, funcionó un tiempo y luego se hecho a perder el cargador y no he podido conseguir repuesto. no lo recomiendo"
1,battery does not last long,I have had the handvac for about two years. after one year the battery life dropped by 50%. now after two years the battery last me about two minutes.
3,Just an OK product,"The good news is that, when new, this vacuum works well. The attachments are actually ""attached"", and, unlike the Black and Decker models, it mounts to the wall out of the way where you pull it off with one hand. The bad news, it only has a minute or so of full power before it retreats. I've had this unit for a year and a half. Now it's sluggish and has no full power left at all. But the lack of a similar wallmount on other brands means that I just might have to buy this guy again."
1,short life,"No good.After a year or so, it stopped charging and I could use for 10second after charging all day.Do not get fulled by the name of the product.""Extreme Power"" LOL"
2,There has to be a better alternative out there,This product does not pick up well and charge does not hold up. Have to hold the vac at an awkward angle for it to do its job.
1,Dirt devil hand vac,Suction is good when the vacumn is a quarter inch from dirt. No range. If you dropped peas on the floor youWould have to vacumn up one at a time. Also battery's life is Jill. I was disappointed and will probablyNever use it again - it serves no purpose
3,broke after 2 years,"This worked great for 2 1/2 years, then it pooped out. I used it for almost all my vacuumming and am very disappointed it no longer has good suction. The charger gets hot. I spent over an hour chatting with Amazon and then calling the manufacturer. Now I have to mail the whole thing back to the manufacturer at my own expense to get it replaced under warranty. After I mail It I have to call the manufacturer back with a tracking number. The shipping time and cost is going to be significant. I just am not too thrilled about the whole thing. Not a good customer support experience although I did love it while it worked."
1,Lasted almost one year,"Bought this as a replacement for the same one that we had for a few years which lasted decently. This one lasted slightly less than one year. It slowly stopped holding a charge, and now when it's turned on, it sounds like it's been sitting out all night off of the charger. But, it's on the charger constantly when not in use. I hate to say that I just got a bad one. It's too late to return it, and nothing I do seems to make it work correctly anymore even replacing the filter. Sad since when I first got it, the thing had excellent power and worked beautifully for quick touch-ups in the bathroom. I use it mostly to vacuum up hair and any cat litter that spills out of my cat's box. It's not like I expect to use it to vacuum the entire house. I expected this product to hold up much better. Going to purchase a Dyson handheld next. At least then I know the quality won't be in question."
2,Doesn't suck (that's a bad thing) and it's loud,"I have always purchased DustBusters in the past, thought I'd give Dirt Devil a try based on the 4 star average review at Amazon. The vacuum itself is too short (you have to bend too low to use it), it has poor suction compared to what I've used before, and it's deafening. Very disappointing."
1,Hideous cradle design,"The mounting/recharging cradle is awful. In our case, the vacuum was stuck to the cradle like glue, with no embossed arrows or other indication of how to separate the two. Do you pull the vacuum up and out of the cradle? Straight out? Push a release button somewhere? I guess you're supposed to have a PhD in mechanical engineering. My bachelor's in mechanical engineering was inadequate; I kept trying to tug and pull apart every which way until finally the plastic broke.Other reviewers have experienced similar cradle problems. Too hard to separate (like ours): one reviewer apparently thinks the two pieces are permanently affixed, and vacuums with the cradle attached. Others complain about the opposite extreme: no positive ""click"" engagement between vacuum and cradle, with the vacuum eventually falling off the wall-mounted cradle.In summation, the design of this vacuum's mounting is hideous and infuriating."
3,Good for only FEW activities,"I purchased this hand vac mostly to clean around the fire place, in the car and around base boards. The suction strength is sufficient. The problem is the design of using the vac WITHOUT the fold out ""wand"". I have not been able to figure out the proper way to hold the vac so that the ""mouth"" will pick stuff up. Sounds crazy, but for the little that I use it, that function has not helped me at all. The ""wand"" is what I use the most because I just aim and point it and it picks up! Great! Although, the wand is TOO SHORT to be very useful in the car ... I cannot get the short stubby wand in between the car seats to get the dirt."
2,"Dirt Devil Extreme Power Hand Vac, MO914","I ordered this vac because of Dirt Devil's reputation and because the vac looked great. I kept the vac on its charger base at all times; however, much to my surprise, the charger light on the base went out and I discovered that my vac had no removable batteries. My building engineer took a look at it and my outlets and pronounced it dead so, I tried to get a refund from Amazon. Well, this was a waste of time. Instead of giving me a refund, Amazon sent me chasing to Dirt Devil. Dirt Devil addressed the problem by sending a new base approximately two weeks ago. More bad news! That one worked for one week ONLY! Now, since I 'm tired of this scenario, I am going to Target or Home Depot and buy a vac (other than Dirt Devil) -- One I can see and feel and one that I can return to a store, if something goes wrong.I purchased this vac, brand new, in early March of 2011. It stopped working in March of 2012 and I am out of $40.48.Dirt Devil Extreme Power Hand Vac, M0914"
1,Battery life is laughable,I expect more from Dirt Devil. Battery life is a joke! Don't waste your money on this. We are searching for an alternate.
2,Not happy with product,"I'm not happy with the product, but unfortunately I've already thrown the packaging away and can't return it. It's heavy, it blows air back in your face, and the nozzle does not stay in place when vacuuming. Would not recommend."
3,"Dirt Devil Extreme Power Hand Vac, M0914","Has good suction, but batteries realy die after about 3 minutes. The next one I buy will be 110vac powered."
4,Dirt Devil Extreme OK,"This replaces a previous unit. The difference between the two is significant. It has enough torque that when you push the button it twists a little in your hand. It really has good suction. You can re-use the filters quite a few times if you tap out the dirt. The ""Quick Flip"" crevice tool rotates out and then pushes in which is a lot more positive than the older unit."
5,Excellent little Vac,"This is the best little hand vac I ever had and I have had a few. I love the built in crevice tool, super easy to slide out you don't have to look for where you put the attachments..also it has a lot of power just like it says. Very pleased and would recommend it to my friends. Claudia from upstate NY"
2,Poor Battery,"Purchased about a year ago and rarely used. Stays plugged in, but battery drains very quickly (within 1 minute of use). Now looking for a replacement and it won't be this one..."
2,"Starts off great, but battery doesn't last long.",This vacuum started off great. After a few months the battery stopped holding a charge. I contacted the manufacturer and they said to let the battery drain all the way down and charge it up again. This doesn't work. Still doesn't hold a charge. I tried to buy a new battery but they don't sell them. I'd spend more in the future and get a better unit.
2,Lasted 6 months,"The Dirt Devil Extreme Power hand vac did everything I needed it to...for the first 6 months. I have owned it since December 2009. At 6 months, I ran into the same issue that has hampered many hand vacuums and that is loss of battery power. It will no longer hold a full charge. Now when I turn it on, it goes full suction for about 15 seconds, then goes way down from there until it finally gives out. I have looked for a replacement battery, but to no avail.I rate this product two stars simply due to it lasting 6 months and had pretty good suction during that time. After that...forget it. It makes a good paperweight. My plight continues on finding a handheld vacuum that will keep a full battery charge."
5,"ok, i'm redundant...",At first I thought the Dirt Devil made too much noise and sucked too much and blew out too much air. And my dogs were afraid of it. But after a while I got used to the vacuum's power. Now I love it. And my dogs don't even move when I'm vacuuming.
4,Very powerful,"Great vac, this is my second one. Only complaint is you can not change the batteries after they wear out."
4,"Very, very handy!","This little portable vac is so darn handy. It is light and portable, yet plenty of power for those little jobs around the house when you don't want to drag around a corded unit. Great little product."
2,Bad battery,Worked great for about 3 months and then it stopped taking a charge. I get about 3 minutes of use before it needs to go back on the charger. Dirt Devil also does not offer a new battery in their parts that are available.
3,"Great, but battery failed after two years","I used to love this machine. But after just two years it became slow, and now I need a new battery.I don't have the expertise to replace the battery and my local vacuum repair store charges thesame for repair as a new one. I think I'll pass on this vacuum, and use my small electric vacuum."
3,Battery Life,"I bought this vacuum 18 months ago and I'm shopping for a replacement now. Although this unit got good reviews and it worked well for a year, the battery no longer holds a charge and is not replaceable. I can't tell what kind of battery it has but my lithium ion powered tool's batteries seem to last much better. I've had several hand held vacuums over the years and it is always the battery that fails first. Hopefully a more expensive lithium ion powered vac (if I can find one) will last much better than this unit did."
2,Unacceptable Battery,I have had this vac for 18 months. It has been used lightly and always stored in its charger. After about 12 months the battery had lost considerable power. It is now so weak as to make the vac almost useless. It will be replaced with another brand.
4,Dirt Devil M0914,"This a great little vacuum.It replaced an older Craftsman hand vac that would no longer hold a charge.If only I had known how much better the Dirt Devil is, I would have upgraded long ago.One of the first jobs this vac had was to clean up some paint chips that had fallen on my gravel drive. I had to be careful not to get the nozzle to close to the ground as it would suck up 3/4"" gravel. That would not have been a issue with the old vac even when it was new.I would recommend this Dirt Devil for any one in need of a small portable vac.7/31/20011This comment is a followup to my above review.After having owned and lightly used this hand vac for about 10 months now, the battery has failed. It will operate at full power for only 10 to 15 seconds straight off the charger. Turns out, this vac was no better than my old powerless Craftsman.I can no longer recommend this Dirt Devil vacuum."
4,Good little handvac,Great for picking up kitty litter the cat tracked out of the litter box or for crumbs left behind by my kids. It's not meant for big jobs and not great on carpet but good for when you don't want to lug the big vacuum out. The crevice tool is useful for tight spaces. Glad I purchased it.
5,AWESOME,This 14 volt handheld vacuum is awesome. It picks up anything and everything in its path. It even has the capability to pick up crumbs and dirt in between my sofa and in my car seats. It's cordless so I can take it anywhere. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap and efficent handheld vacuum.
2,this vacuum has limited use - keep looking,"I bought this item and found it disappointing. Design-wise, it has a cheap feel, and the flip-down detailing nozzle is poorly designed and easy to break. Buyers should be aware that the main suction opening is only about 1 1/4 inches wide, so this vacuum is useless for rugs and stairs take forever. It is good for limited detailing, like for cracks and windowsills. The power wears down fairly quickly--another drawback."
1,poor filter system,"The filter becomes clogged after 2 uses. It is never the same, hard to clean, faces the wrong way for optimal cleaning. More trouble than it is worth."
2,just like its brothers -- not much good but necessary,"I've had a million of these things. All brands. The longest one has worked was about three years. They are all junk. But better than a broom and dust pan. So far this one is working good. This is the second or third Dirt Devil I've owned so the brand must be as good or better than the others. The price is okay. The filters work good and are easy to change and last a long time. But sooner or later the motor starts to sound wheezy and tired and then it's back shopping for another one. Unfortunately, cars are the same way. At least these things are cheap. Good luck."
2,Not totally useless,"I bought this to use in my car. It was not powerful enough to do a more than a modest job. I wish that I had not bought it, and just paid for a powerful vacuum at the car wash. The Dirt Devil will do OK if you are just picking up dust bunnies, cat hair, or light objects. I gave it 2 stars instead of three because I consider it's label, ""Extreme Power"" to be false advertising."
3,Hand held vacuum,"IT does the job of picking up small quantities of ""dirt"" and that is why I bought it."
2,Still waiting....,"Just so you know the time frame for delivery of this item seems to be a bit off. I ordered mine 1/11/05 and just today I got a second email telling me that they HOPE it will be available sometimes in the next 2-3 weeks. I'm sorry I ever attempted the switch from Black and Decker. Their 7.2 Volt machine was wonderful (not the standard one), but mine finally died after 15+/- years of abuse by our large family and I thought I would try the Dirt Devel because the price was right at the time. I will give it two more weeks and then it's back to B&D; for me! At least I can buy replacment batteries for those at any hardware store...... Not something we can say for Dirt Devil, now can we? Maybe you will see a great review from me on the product itself by the end of the month - but don't hold your breath. After waiting over a month it's going to take one heck of a handheld vac to impress me!-Norene Parker"
4,works great for cleaning the inside of my car.,"I bought the dirt devil extreme power hand vac for my car. i use it to clean it out instead of paying to use a vacume at the car wash, the dirt devil will pay for itself in about two months and ill be happy that its free for me after that."
4,satisfaction with Dirt Devil Extreme Power,"Dirt Devil M0914 Extreme Power Quick-Flip Rechargeable Handheld Vacuum CleanerThis replaced a small Dustbuster and what I like best is that it's able to be used for a longer period of time without loosing the ability to suction. I can usually get up all the areas that I want to clean without having to put it back in the charger. The only think that I don't like , so far, is that it vents out the side and sometimes it's blowing out in my face. It's not quiet, but not so lout that it is annoying. I would recommend this product."
5,A good buy on my Dirt Devil,"This is an excellant product we now own two of them and the price was even better. I found that Amazon was $3.oo cheaper than Wallyworld, no tax and no shipping. Another great buy from Amazon and a great product."
1,Dirt devil is no angel,"Thinking that this small hand held machine would pickup those small messes without dragging out the bigElectrolux, I was sorely disappointed. Not having many instances to use this machine, it sat quietly in itscradle being readied for action, so I thought. Trouble is, the batterry was still being depleted of power andtry to find a battery to replace the old, they're no where available. Made in China. Another joke on us."
1,NOT extreme power,"The only thing Extreme about this machine is the amount of noise it makes compare to how much suction it creates. It picks up some lighter things if it has been charging for a few days then rapidly loses power after just a minute or so of use. It takes forever to recharge. I usually give up using it and just go get our 7 year old Black and Decker Dust Buster that is much more powerful than this. If you leave it off the charger for a day, it will lose it's charge. I've exchanged it thinking I just got a bad one, but the new one was just as weak. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. It is the last Dirt Devil product I will ever buy!"
4,Super portable vacuum,Does a great job cleaning up small messes. Extension wand difficult to open and close.
3,powerful hand vac,"This vacuum is easy to use and is more powerful than any other brands I've used.It's easy to take apart and put back together. I also appreciate the fact that the air doesn't blow back in my face.My complaints are about the design and composition of the filter, the fact that it can't be washed, the cost of replacements, and that it HAS to be cleaned after every use. The dirt/dust chamber is smaller than other brands I've used so you may have to empty it at least once before your cleaning job is finished. When the filter is emptied in the garbage can, you will have to be careful because dust may fly everywhere. The filter can't be cleaned easily because of how it's made and what it's made of. Because of dust flying, I have to take it outside and use a vegetable brush to remove as much dirt as I can.I guess nothing is perfect."
4,powerful,"I like the power with this product. Also it's extending narrow nozzle for small spaces. It fits easily into its charger. the only minor problem is its weight, but I guess you have to have that for power"
1,Short Lived,"I bought the Dirt Devil 15.6v cordless EXTREME Power. The power was great, the unit looked great, the suction was great all for about a total of one month. After each charge the battery in my unit got weaker and weaker. Finally the entire unit just died. I could understand this unit expiring if I used the vacuum everyday for several minutes at a time however I only used this unit about twice a month and only for 1 or 2 minutes. I've only had to empty the canister once since I have owned it. The unit and the filter still look brand new but I have EXTREME disappointment in the longevity of this product. It is possible that I purchased a LEMON and it is possible that this is the exception not the rule. However I have notified Dirt Devil Customer Service about my problem and if they do make things right(which I doubt) I will be happy to write another review to at least let everyone know that they stick by their products and take care of their disappointed customers. The Colonel"
3,Battery doesn't last,"This is a nice little vac, but the battery just doesn't cut it. It will get weaker and weaker as the seconds tick away. I can't bring this out to my car and clean the whole thing. I can bring it out and clean the front, then go back inside and charge it again, and come back out later to clean the back of the car. This is after I have owned the product for 2 years. It was a bit better when I got it, but still not good in terms of battery life.Still good for a quick clean up of dust, dirt, crumbs, etc. but not for anything that is measured in minutes rather than seconds."
2,Dirt Devil Extreme Power,"This Dirt Devil is maybe Extreme Power and cordless, however, once it's charged for several hours, the battery lasts only very very little.Ened up returning and replacing with the one with the cord, much more hapier."
2,Poor battery life,I have had two of these and they work great but both started to lose power in abour 2 years. One is dead to the world and the other is good for just a few minutes. pparently no battery replacement.
2,Short-lived; medium power,"After (barely) using it for about 8 months, it loses power in about 30 seconds; and it wasn't as powerful to begin with.Kinda heavy for a handheld vac."
3,OK while it lasted,"The vac was alright. A little clunky with the back and forth wand adapter, wand worked better with wand extended than theclosed, without variation. Battery died after a couple of years. I will be looking for another brand this time."
4,If you appreciate real women.,while the cover modle is not a good represintation of the models in the book. It is a book that really shows the real everyday women that roam the earth in all thier natural beauty. I bought this book to aid in an art class study. This was an outstanding book to own.
1,Same tired stuff,Nothing new here. Same old tired nudes that you can find in dozens of books. Photo quality is mediocre - poor image designs. The women in most of these pictures look terrible.
1,Too small!,It is very small and one of the leg is missing and very hard to bend. I wouldn't recommend this product because it's really a ramekin with a cheap little candle with wire.
1,"good idea, poor execution","it was a good idea, but it doesnt work out.the instructions were for another model, the set barely stood on its own, the dipping sticks barely held the food. overall, Not Worth It."
3,Its working,"I do not like the cable is too tick and difficult to move around, specially for someone that doesnt have the strenghtto move it, too stiff for me."
5,Flat plug,I needed a flat plug on my extension cord so that the furniture could slide all the way back to the wall and this did it!
2,You get what you pay for,The kit was overall great design but when the 30w Solder iron doesn't get hot cept near the handle(well halfway up really) makes it hard to solder small parts as the tip is not hot enough which defeats the purpose of the iron... I will not be buying another one of these and cannot recommend this kit for anyone looking for a good iron....
1,cheap cummins tool,This product was all scattered in box like it wasn't new and the product looked to be cheaply made. Not going to even try to use it. I will re-sell it and buy a nicer soldering set.
5,"Nice, Just what we were looking for","Very good seller, Quick Shipper, Very nice Product, Looks good, Works well.We bought these two for my Mother-n-law and sister-n-law. The one I bought for my wife works great, get's a lot of use. ( back , Shoulder injuries).."
4,fast delivery,"The herbal packs smell more like menthol than anything else. They are all very nice sized, no scrimming on the herbs in the packs. The neck wrap and back wrap are much larger than expected. I am hoping the more we warm them up the more herbal smell comes out of them."
4,tension release,I have enjoyed this product. After a day of work I will heat it up and place it on the area that is the tightest. It does help.
4,does what it's supposed to,"the product is fine, does what it's supposed to. i dont use anything else except the neck wrap to warm my lap at work. holds heat well, i microwave it with a cup of water because im scared it might dry out the filling and the fabric. so far so good."
3,Strong and Heavy,I have a torn disc in my neck and have sever muscle spasms. The shoulder and neck piece is VERY heavy. I cant really sit up with and an be comfortable for too long.The belt piece has plastic on it for the buckle around the waist for lower back and it get warm so there is a concern there.I have a small microwave unfortunately and the only ones that fit to where I can get the heat evenly are the smaller ones.And if you have migraines you wont be able to handle the heavy smell if your like me and my girls when I am in pain...light and smells really bother me. Although they can be a benefit I have not used them that much since I recvd it and will keep it only cuz my girls might use it.For me I will look for the Original Bed Buddy that is a rice filled sock with handles on the end made of rope type material. It smelled light and worked well. I wish I had thought of doing a search before I bought this product BUT I am sure this may be a better fit for others but not for me.
3,A decent kit but quality is just ok,"In general this kit is pretty good. The items I used most were the shoulder pack and the back belt. They get hot and they stay hot for a decent amount of time. When I decided I wanted these herbal packs it was because I used an herbal pack that a friend had. These packs did not smell as nice when heated and I don't think they use a high quality fill compared to some other packs out there. Also, my shoulder pack broke and obviously the stuff came out. It looked like these things are filled mostly with rice or something. I'll try to post a pic of the filling one of these days.Also, the picture shows the items in purple. Mine came in black and I would have preferred the purple.In general I like the kit and I'm glad I got it but it somewhat missed the mark in quality for me. I'll be looking to replace some of the components with some of the made in the USA brands which will hopefully be similar in quality as to what I tried in the past."
1,Worst heating pad EVER!,"I purchased this heating pad set based on the rerview, and because I had a similar product(that was great, but getting worn from daily use over years), which I wanted to replace. When the set came I was very disappointed! The fabric is extremley hard and uncomfotable! which defeats the whole purpose of a heating pad. The only reason I gave the product one star is because it does get hot.When I called and informed the seller that I was not satisfied with the product I was told that a repackaging fee would be deducted from my return. The product came in plastic bags with tape, which I resealed in the same condition I received them in! Total rip off! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Watch out for this buyer/manufacturer. One of the four packs is NOT suitable to use as a heating pack at all!!! I tried heating it in the microwave and no matter how long I heated it, the temperature never changed. Then I wrote to the buyer complaining of this. He wrote back and said that this one pack (peppermint small pack) was NOT supposed to be microwaved or heated, and that it could cause a FIRE if placed in the microwave. Nice knowing that after the fact!!! The buyer suggested I contact the manufacturer with my complaint. Bad buyer, bad product, bad information... BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Produce Disaster,"This item did not meet my expectations at all. Product did not heat up or retain cold long enough to be effective. Eye pad emitted and leaked a sticky gel substance onto skin, and was completely irritating. Belt buckle on hip pad did not work properly. In all, this item was a complete failure - a disaster, a waste of my time and money."
4,Loud and crisp.,These headphones are perfect for all kinds of music. The clarity of sound is amazing considering the size of these things. When you flick on the bass boost (present on most portable audio players) your whole ear vibrates to the booming music.They are also very comfortable. Also as the speakers are located at the tip of the headphone the music is directed right down your ear giving very little music leakage when you have the volume up high.I would really advise buying these.4 stars.
4,"Really great sound..., but poor wires!","I agree with all the previous reviewers: the headphones are really nice. They fit well in your ears and give you a tremendous sound but... the wires are terribly weak! :-(If Philips succeeds in correcting this ""minor"" (and annoying) problem they will have an unbeatable champ! For sure!:-)"
2,Good... For A While...,"I bought these about a year ago, and they delivered great sound and bass with relatively decent comfort. However, after about a month of ownership, they began to fall apart. It all culminated when on a trip they snapped in my bag, even though they were protected. Decent headphones, but shoddy worksmanship."
2,"Worked great for two months, then broke","These headphones are a little heavier than the sony sport models that come with your walkmen, but they sound every bit as good, if not better. However, after about two months of use my connection to the left ear piece died, and it only comes back if I hold the cord at just the right angle. My other headphones lasted me about 8 years before that happened, so these must be a shoddy piece of work. Hopefully you will have better luck with yours if you decide to try them."
1,"good sound, bad wiring",I bought a pair of these. while the sound is good the wires started to give out after a few months.
2,Irritates my ears,"The sound is okay for it's price, but the headphones hurt my ears. The shape is flat on one side and round on the other. After I wore them for a while, the headphones started getting hot and they made my outer ears hurt. I traded headphones with my friend and she said the headphones didn't hurt THAT much. I'm a big comfort lover and these headphones arent very comfortable."
1,A shame to all Pit owners,"This book not only has pit fighting rules from the 70's, but the photos are dull and even the few color ones aren't quality. This is the book for you if you are the type that likes to sit on your grandpa's lap and hear his ol' Pit stories. Even die-hard dog breeders couldn't use this in there arsenal of books. Don't waste you money on this one."
1,Pitbulls are not just fighting dogs,"I resent the way pitbulls are portrayed as fighting objects when in fact they are very loving kind creatures. I personally own a full-blooded APBT and he has a heart of gold. He greets strangers with kisses and is the most loving good natured dog I have ever seen not to mention submissive. A dogs actions are a direct reflection of how they were trained. Dont blame pitbulls, blame the irresponsible people that train their dogs improperly!!!"
1,Horrible Book,"I do not recommend this book. Richard Stratton is in favor for Pit fights. He even gives how-to's. The photos in the book are extremely old. It seems he doesn't know the breed, ie. the breed shouldn't play with other dogs...Pit Bulls are extremely loving and gentil dogs. Pits are what their master are. It's all about the owner."
4,Review of The American Pit Bull Terrier,Overall pretty good book. My only complaint is that its very similar to Strattons other books. I am not a dog fighter but I do study the breed extensively and I feel Stratton does give you a good history and back ground on dog fighting and the APBT.
5,The other side of the APBT,This is a great book if you want to learn more about dog fighting and the abilities of pitt bulls in such competitions. You just need to see the cover to figure this out. If you are looking for general information of the breed this book is not very helpful. This books clearly describes the fighting background of this great breed and how it has develop to what we know today as the APBT
3,The GMRS 1535- Is an o.k. bubble pack,"I bought one of these a few months ago, and found it to be an o.k. radio. A license, which I already had, is required as mentioned- or should be mentioned, everywhere GMRS radio equipment is sold. It has good WX reception even with the stock antenna, and has o.k. audio sound. Compared to my FR140s, this radio is less. Range from any consumer grade radio, regardless of TX power, will give you no more range than an FRS radio. So, if you were considering a GMRS radio over an FRS radio because of claimed added range, then you might as well just stick with FRS because it will work better than most of these."
4,Sheena shines like never before,"Throughout her career, Easton has somehow managed to explore a wide spectrum of musical genres without ever once earning the earnest respect of critics. This collection of standards, while by no means perfect, would easily have changed that if anyone had heard it. On the eleven tracks, from the ubiquitous ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" (has anyone not recorded this song?) to the more swinging and refreshingly pessimistic ""Never Will I Marry,"" Easton displays a tremendous control over her voice that is rarely seen in pop artists today (Mariah and Celine don't know the meaning of subtlty). Easton has the confidence and poise to let the material shine, and it only serves to make her sound like a superstar. If she decides to go further down this path in the future, there is no doubt she will earn the praise that so easily comes to less deserving voices. ""No Strings"" is an highly engaging record with which many will rediscover this talent."
2,I know what you're thinking....,"""....Hmmm, Sheena Easton - didn't she sing 'Morning Train' back in the early eighties? What's she doing releasing jazz standards?.... Hey, she's looking good on the cover...""Sheena had a nice pop voice then, breathy and girlish. It can convey girlish vulnerability, but not much else. It isn't a versatile voice, or one for jazz. Her voice still is high and airy, and she will never be able to sustain most of the material here.If you are looking for pop singers doing jazz classics, try Linda Ronstat or Natalie Cole, who both did a much better job.Why then, two stars instead of one? Well, she DOES look pretty good on the cover...."
2,High school girl sings the blues,"That's the impression I got when I first listened to this album. Sheena is a good enough pop singer, but this classic jazz/cabaret material is completely out of her reach, emotionally and vocally. Her attempts at emoting (as in ""The Man That Got Away"") come across as whiny, the equivalent of a teenage girl complaining about a bad prom date or her most recent adolescent heartache. This is not the effect this material should have on the listener, believe me. This album will be of interest to fans of the singer, but those looking for the real thing should stick to veteran, time-proven vocalists with the emotional chops to put this material across properly."
4,Entertainment You Can Learn From,"I bought this because my wife was featured as an extra in the film. Being a History and Discovery Channel fanatic, I was eagerly expecting a boiler plate documentary with scenes reinacted for dramatic effect. I was pleasantly surprised to find is was more of a historical drama film with narration to place the action in its historic context.Despite the low-budget nature of the production, I found the acting fair considering. The story is told well from both sides: German and Allied. It's not ""Titanic,"" but I strongly recommend it for disaster/action film buffs who may not be as enthusiatic about sitting for hours tuned to the History Channel. You will be entertained and learn something at the same time."
2,Would not order again,"I was looking for a change from my typical brand of after shave (which is L'Oreal Men's Expert Comfort Max). The only reason I wanted a change was because I was getting bored with the other.My preference is to use an after shave that combines soothing with healthy moisturizing and sun block, with a light or non-existent scent.Problems:1) The product description says this has UAV and UAB sun block. When I received the product, I noticed this wasn't mentioned anywhere on the packaging or the container. Hmm. SO I'm not confident it actually has sun block.2) The scent is a little heavy for my taste, but that's a personal preference. It's not offensive.3) It doesn't do a very good job soothing my face after shaving. And I shave very easily. In fact, some days this just burns.It's not worth returning, but I wouldn't order it again or recommend it to a friend."
3,E3 spark plugs,"Did not do anything special that any ""new"" set of plugs would have done. Save your money and buy a good standard plug."
4,"To E3 or Not To E3, That is the Question?","After watching the E3 Special on TV. I decided to Give them A shot. I Installed these on a 2007 6.2L Denali and I can honestly say that I have not noticed any increase in fuel economy but have noticed that the engine seems to idle smoother than before. As far as power the Denali has never left me wanting more so the jury is still out on that one. Overall they were a good price and with the 100,000 mile warranty from E3 I look forward to putting them to the test."
1,Plugs fouled withing 1500 Miles,"These plugs were the worst I have every used. Will Notpurchase them again! Fouled after about 1500 miles, computer reset upon install, and seemed fine at first. But items not worth the price."
4,Know your movies.,The deluxe edition comes with interviews from the cast and gives insight to the making of the movie that I found very interesting.
4,Expert Advise,"Management responsibility takes on a new dimension in ISO 9001:2000.This book gives managers a concise guide about the changes to management's role to meet the ISO 9001:2000 requirements. This book focuses on management responsibility, management commitment, quality planning and objectives, management review, customer, and continuous improvement.After the publication of ISO 9000:2000 In a Nutshell Authors Jeanne Ketola and Katty Roberts offer again a very concise and easy to use guide this time on Management Responsibility.This is guide on section 5 of the ISO 9000:2000 standard and explains the intent of each standard subsections and offer tips for implementation."
2,"A good ""Lay on the Beach"" read","In spite of others comments, I enjoyed this book. I found it easy to read, albeit more romatic than suspenseful. It took me two days to read while listening to the waves crash and I felt refreshed afterwards."
2,a very fragmented story line,After the first fifty pages I had to force myself to finish this story. I think the author's intent in jumping from character to character was to add to the suspense one step at a time. Instead she succeeded in losing my interest. I would reccommend that the reader borrow this book as it is not a keeper.
1,Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hate to say this but, this was one of the worst books that I've ever read. I don't want to hurt the author's feelings if she should happen to read this. But honestly, this was the worst book that I've ever read. It usually takes me no more than a week to read a book-if it's interesting. But I had this book for @6 weeks and I just finished it today. It was slow and it was not the thriller that it was supposed to be. Hopefully, the author will get it right next time."
3,finding replacement for lost mixed drink recipe book,"Has a lot of the classic coctails in it, but missing a few necessary items like ""Fish House Punch"" the way I used to make it. Useful, but not comprehensive."
4,not a horrible book,"i like this book, i probibly won't make all the cocktails in here but it has some nice basic recipies for starting bartenders"
5,Book of Cocktails,Very useful book! i've known a lot of things from it! would recommend to everyone!
4,In liquor cabinet,Great small book for you to get started making cocktails. I found myself desiring knowledge on how to make cocktails so I could appear more sophisticated and classy. This helped me do it. The book is small which is good because you can just keep it on hand next to your liquor cabinet. It has many and all the cocktails I've ever though about are in there. I've only tried a few but will continue try them over time.
3,Funnier on Paper,"If you are a fan of Robert Benchley's writing, of course you need this to complete your collection, which is why I give this three stars. His humor doesn't quite translate to the screen, probably because these short films by their nature depend a bit more on images than snappy repartee. Many of them are a bit stodgy compared to Benchley's sharp, quick, written humor. So...first step, any anthologies of his humor articles you can find. (Bonus - hysterical illustrations by Gluyas Williams.)Second step, his brilliant theatre reviews. Then, complete your collection with this admittedly rare anthology of shorts."
4,Funny Shorts,"Robert Benchley was one of the great American humorists of the 1930s. His shorts were popular additions to the movies shown in the 1930s and 1940s, with commentary and observations on modern life which were popular at the time. Most of his jokes still resonate today, although at times Benchley's delivery leaves something to be desired. A fun set of ""miniatures!"""
5,Great Christmas family time!,"Our family loves this book. My kids are 9 and 12 and they both love it, as do I! It was a great find for us and it will be for your family too."
4,Nice Little History of Mothers Mk I,"This book contains a pretty decent history of Zappa and the Mothers from 65 - 70. The anecdotal information is delivered by the guys who lived the experience, Preston, Black, Collins, Estrada, Gardener, and others who joined later. The actual history is a wee bit short and the writing style is somewhat... well, James clearly doesn't write books and wasn't educated to write books for a living, let's just put it that way. Still, it is and enjoyable, quick read.An interesting read for all who want to learn about the early Mothers. Don't expect to understand the contradictions that are Frank Zappa after reading this. There probably isn't anything that could impart that kind of understanding."
2,Little Miss Ego,"What an obnoxious book! Miss Lee apparently thinks she's God's gift to music.....page after page of ""lookie what I did and ain't I somethin'"" gets old after awhile. She should take humility lessons from Loretta Lynn, whose new book is MOST enjoyable."
3,Interesting !!,Didn't know much about her until this book. Haven't quite finished it yet but am enjoying it .Would recommend to those who are interested in her type of music.
3,Just misses the mark,"This is a strange hybrid of a biography and an autobiography. There are a lot of quotes from other people about Brenda Lee, something you'd expect to find in a biography. You will certainly learn the basic facts of her early life, family, and career, but just the facts. Occasionally Lee does offer some personal insight or observation, but they are rare. Unfortunately, too much of the filler in this book is about the pop and music culture of the 1950s and 1960s with Brenda Lee only playing a part in it. I got the vague impression that Lee was kept so busy and preoccupied with her career during her formative years that she really doesn't remember it herself (she has two co-writers of her ""autobiography""). To her loyal fans, Miss Lee can do no wrong, as evidenced by the gushing reviews they give her here; I like her music too but I don't think she had enough personal material to warrant an ""autobiography."""
5,"an easy, very honest read","a fast-paced book about theglobe.com. yes, we've heard the story a million times over from the press, but this is an honest and extremely personal account from one of the founders. lots of ups-n-downs, but you come out of it with the feeling that anything is possible with a little ambition."
4,An excellent story...,"While this is not Shakespeare- it is an excellent story about the dot.com boom and bust. Paternot uses the same language that you would expect to hear on the street, and that is refreshing- especially when the author went to Cornell, and was worth $98,000,000 (on paper) for one day.The only failing for the book is that he did not go into as much detail as I would have liked him too- the book could have lasted another 100 pages and it probably would of been better if it had. Regardless, I recommend this book if you are interested in the dot.com boom and bust..."
1,a whitewash by a callow founder,"At an age when he should have been interning in an NGO or assistant-managing a fast food outlet, Paternot became a tycoon on paper. That was a topsy-turvy, demented era that evokes only embarrassment and disdain now. Now Paternot, who was part of vaporizing trusting investors' money, tries yet again to make a few bucks off the corpse of that era. Don't help him. Borrow the book through interlibrary loan (it is unlikely your particular library will own it) and struggle through his amateurish prose for free."
2,Style over substance.,"As a recent MBA grad, I would have to say that I was awfully disappointed in what could have been --should have been an amazing book on par with other documentaries of the dotcom meltdown, such as the fantastic movie ""Startup.com,"" about the crashing and burning of GovWorks.Mr. Paternot seems barely contrite, and I would be frightened at the prospect of hiring him in another capacity because he does not seem to have genuinely learned from his mistakes.The writing style is light. It was certainly an easy read, but the time spent reading this book could have been better spent learning how to avoid the excesses and mistakes committed by the author. It gets 2 stars from me for ease of reading, editing and parts of the style.I was a fan of The Globe, and it is a shame that I cannot recommend this book as highly as the service."
5,"A true ""one-stop shop"" for bible dictionaries","Although this is the first bible dictionary i've purchased, it has already in many ways exceeded my expectations. I find that alot of the questions I have ever had, particularly about the old testament, are often answered just by flipping through the pages. A very great value for Bible study."
5,Wonderful,I love this book-- great photos and information. Just needs more words to define. Great product for the person who wants to start a real bible study.
4,Very Useful,"I find it covers most - not all by any means - of the questions I have about the Bibles terms or words. Usually there is a clear and total explaination. Sometimes nothing at all. I'd highly recommend it. But you may find, as I did, you have to go beyond for more information at times."
1,Kindle Edition,"I have enjoyed Unger's Bible Dictionary over the years. However, the Kindle edition gets zero for searches. Clarification: One can search for a word and everywhere it appears in the dictionary will be shown. Sometimes hundreds. BUT - when searching for an particular article, such as 'Jonah', all that pops up is every single instance of the word in the dictionary. Most Kindle dictionaries will come up with suggestions as you begin typing the word. This one only allows you to go to the beginning of each letter group and then you must page through until the article appears. What a waste of time. Please help."
5,More Than Pleased with My Unger's Bible Dictionary!,"This particular Bible dictionary is by far the most complete for reference work when studying Scripture. By looking up particular people, places, and events, I have come to a far better understanding while studying. I would not hesitate to recommend this dictionary to anyone who wants the absolute best."
3,Quickly received but the condition was a little disappointing.,"We received the quite quickly. However, the spine on the book was broken and there was no mention of that in the description."
1,Book spine and cover damaged upon reciept returned.,"The book was damaged upon reciept, the spine was broken and the book cover had a deep scratch the book was supposed to be new"
5,The best,"funny, funny, funny. Davis plays Beethoven's ""Apassionata"" Sonata (1st movement greatly abridged) with candlesticks ala Liberace. Rains the Composer spits ( ""I write phttt and they play phtt...) It is a hoot. Excellent Korngold piece... what a waste of that composer's talent to have only done mostly movie music. He was unappreciated, maybe, in other venues?0 Any way, a great flick."
3,Leaves some major questions un-answered,"A ""typical"" Bette Davis potboiler, but in this one the pot just can't quite reach the boiling point and goes flat. Davis is in love with composer Claude Rains, but suddenly encounters the man she's loved in the past (Paul Henreid) - and the vicious triangle is set up. The old love hasn't died, and she marries Henreid, but decides to keep her affair with Rains a secret from him. Rains is insanely jealous and hurt by her sudden marriage and attempts revenge: he threatens to tell Henreid everything. Davis shoots him just before a big concert (Henreid is a cellist about to premier a new work by Henreid - what a coincidence!).Some of this doesn't make sense: why the big secret? And hardest of all to figure out is why does she shoot Rains and then tell Henreid everythng anyway? The script, especially the dialogue is prety weak and lifeless, though Rains manages to shine. What's lacking most in this picture is inspiration."
2,From a Davis fan in D.C.,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers of this film. This was one of the slower, less interesting films that Davis made. The title of the movie led me to believe she was going to be her usual ""Bad Bette"", full of fiest and independance. This is not the case. This movie contains no excitement, and the story is not involving."
4,"Claude Rains outBette's Bette (Davis, that is)","This is Rains at his best male bitchiness. The dinner with Davis and Heinreid (usually cut for some inexplicable reason when this film makes an extremely rare appearance on commercial late-night television)is worth the price of purchase: a degree of sophistication almost non-existent in most American-made movies of this or any era, post Hayes-office. This is a movie of an era that is vanished and can never be duplicated. It's like looking at a John Singer Sargent portrait. The music may even sound good at this late 1990's remove from classical film music of the 1940's."
5,One of Bette Davis' greatest films!,This is a movie no fan of Bette Davis should miss seeing. The story really holds your interest. I'd give it more stars if I could. They don't make them like this anymore.
5,As Good As The Other Seasons,"I can't stand Dennis Leary as a comedian, however he is excellent as Tommy Gavin. He has found his nitch."
5,Leary just keeps on going....,"I've watched all seasons, all episodes, multiple times, something I have not done with any other show, ever, period.I was watching really closely during season three and more so in season 4 for signs, any signs at all, that the show was going to take a dive, because it seemed impossible that a series could keep it up for so long. And with Rescue Me, what's UP is a long, long way compared to any other series.It is up there, out there, nothing really compares. I am biting my nails waiting for season five. So, does season 4 compare with the previous 3?Oh yeah! It is just as funny, it is just as raw, it is just as dramaticas the first three. each episode will involve you deeply and leave you craving the next and when the ending of the last episode sinks in, you will be howling with laughter at the absolute righteousness and yowling with disbelief that you have to wait for the next season to start to continue this journey through Leary's creativity which seems boundless."
3,rescue me series,"Not sure what to think of this series, it does grow on you. One thing for certain, this series is definately out of the ordinary!"
3,Rescue Me Season 4 DVD,"Excellent deal and fast shipping. Both of the DVD case's disc holder tabs were all busted. However, even with replacing the DVD cases this item is still cheaper than anywhere else."
3,Fourth time was not a charm,"After watching the previous seasons, I couldnt wait for number four, in actuality, I could have waited for number four!The series seems to be going the way of all series that lose their way after a few seasons..(ala the Sopranos), the writers need to go back to review what made the series a success in seasons one through three.Dont get me wrong,if you like Denis Leary, you can tolerate this season, but there needs to be a five alarm wake up call for the writers!!!Please Rescue Me with a great Fifth Season!"
3,Rescue me may need rescuing,"I think the first 3 seasons are solid and very well written. I found the 4th season weak in plot and to be harsh, a little boring. It tries to pick up the pieces from the previous 3 seasons and follow on, but thats all it is really. No great twists or events. The new stories are slow and predictable which is disappointing. I was looking forward to this season as i love the first 3 seasons, and i would buy this 4th season only to follow up the final episode of the 3rd season which left me hanging on... but i probably will not watch theses episodes in a hurry again. Hope season 5 is more energetic."
5,Rescue Me Season Four,I'm very satisfied with this season just like the other three seasons. It is the very best show on the air so glad FX has the foresight to keep us well entertained !!
1,It's getting boring!,Unless you're a die hard fan of this series - then save your money and don't buy Season 4. it's become the Tommy Gavin show - there's hardly any focus on the other great characters. It's one long boring scene featuring T.G after another. The first few seasons were great - but it just hasn't maintained it's momentum.
2,not a fan anymore,"I loved seasons 1,2 but it seems like the ensomble cast are background players now. It's the Tommy (Denis Leary) show."
2,Disappointed.,"I fell in love with this show when I saw the pilot. I've since seen all the seasons and continued to watch all of them over and over while patiently waiting for the fourth season to be released.Well, I as disappointed. The fourth season is not nearly as interesting as the others. It lacks the creativity the others had, and while the other seasons were emotional, they were still upbeat. This one was just depressing. They had so much to work with and they did nothing with it."
2,So disappointing,"After the excellence of the first three seasons, season four is really disappointing. It loses any sense of realism in the characters, they act out of character, plot lines seem to be reworkings of previous plots and the whole thing feels a bit tired and desperate. As is so often the case, it appears they didn't manage to stop while they were winning!"
4,What The Manual Should Have Been,"This book does an excellent job of leading the FrontPage beginner throught the mechanics of the program and explaining the possibilities available. Where the supplied manual explains what can be done, this book shows how to do it in an entertaining manner. Five stars would have been earned had there been a section with examples (not tutorials) and how they were achieved using tricks and graphics."
4,"Good starting point, worth the price","I read this book a couple of years ago as a fledgling ""web master"" for a non-profit organization. With virtually no experience in web design before, I was able to complete this book in a weekend and start designing in Front Page. It was the perfect book to get me started. I have since outgrown Front Page and moved up to Dreamweaver which is much better suited for large advanced sites. Though, I still think Front Page is the fastest way to create a simple website and the easiest way to manage a small to medium sized website. Front Page for dummies will give you the essential skills you need to use Front Page and is a quick easy read. Well worth the nominal price of the book."
3,Minor Upgrade to FP98 for Dummies,"Not a bad book for complete newbies, but I was hoping for some detailed info on the most exciting part of FP2000- its ability to generate its own database and query it. Don't look for ""database"" in the index. It's mentioned on p.215 where it refers you to the program's online help. There is no coverage of ASP."
2,"""Fast and Easy"" Books are Much Better","After reading ""Frontpage '98 - Fast and Easy"" when I was using that version of the program, I have to say that this book is not up to the task. Information is unnecessarily repeated, sometimes within the same chapter. It has no flow or momentum towards easily completing a web site. And it curiously contains few illustrations and screen shots for a ""Dummy"" book. I'm going back to the ""fast and Easy"" series."
1,Front Page for Dummies 2000 flops!,"I wanted a book to learn FP 2000, I went straight to the Dummie section. The Dummie proved to be me.First let me say, I have been creating websites for several years in HTML, so I'm not a novice, but this book frustrated me!Poorly written, jumps around until you are confused. Skims each subject, nothing in depth here. A lot of important information is skipped, and 2 chapters are on the CD. So, if you want to use them, you have the expense of printing them yourself! The CD is full of outdated links also.I actually learned more using the tutorial that came with FP 2000, the Dummy book was a complete waste of my limited book funds..."
2,Not for dummies,"I never got past the beginning. Something has been left out of the directions for getting started. I'm sure that advanced users would find this a good reference. But like most text books I've seen, you have to know something about web pages to use the book."
4,like new,"I purchased this book used for $1.00, and was quite impressed with the condition of the book. It looked brand new and had one mark on the inside cover."
3,different,"This young lady had some good points and some bad points. She is very opinionated. Since I am a writer that writes to bring healing to women in the church, that have suffered through abusive and violent relationships, I believe she should be more balanced in her inference that a woman can ""make"" a man be what she wants him to be. He has the responsibility to meet the criteria that the bible sets for godly relationships.A Letter to My Sisters: The Way Out"
1,Misleading title.,"I'm 13 years old and looking 4 something empowering feminine, ( in a world where there seems none ), and this book did not do it 4 me cuz this book should be called ""the power of being a CHRISTIAN woman,""not a woman in general.my family isn't christian.so women are not limited to the patriarch scrips.i found more empowering things about women through historical /natural reseatch than thru this book.women were always feared in the past to have subtle charm and even occult knowlidge.so theres more to women than jus 'giving into ur husband' xtian women will LOVE this book tho"
1,"For the love of God, give me a break...","This book does not even deserve one star but unfortunately it's the lowest rating I could give it. Is she serious? She's making riddiculous points.She says women should be submissive to our hubands. Bull. She says that we should be content with ""influencing"" the decision makers. Nope. I'll join in the decision making thank you.Equality is beautiful. Equality regardless of race, gender, ethnicity and class. It doesn't make sense to say that the man must always be the head of the household for the simple fact that he's a male. Girlfriend, you are not talking to your fellow girlfriend. You're setting us back. Sit down and back off."
2,Serviceable but unexceptional stuff,"Death Drums Along the River offered Nic Roeg his first story credit, although you won't find it on the curiously chopped up credits of this Harry Alan Towers update of Sanders of the River. About the only thing it shares with the Paul Robeson version is Sanders himself, played with a lightness of touch that you don't usually associate with Richard Todd. Despite a typically inept start, this is one of old HAT's better efforts, a serviceable programmer that passes the time without ever threatening to lodge in the memory, which by his standards is a masterpiece.The Australian PAL DVD offers an unexceptional fullframe transfer cropped from the original 2.35:1 with no extras."
3,there are better,"It is a nice relaxing CD to listen to, but not as amazing az EROS which I absolutely love."
4,Pretty good,"This headphone are nice, I love them, but I've been using this pair for like 8-10 months now and I've kinda blown them out, it sucks"
4,"Pretty good, but...","The sound quality of these headphones are quite good.However, I have purchased two of these, and both broke : (One simply degraded over time, and the other snapped at the hard plastic area on the right side."
3,Looks better than it sounds...,"Ok, so I bought these headphones a couple weeks ago. They looked cool, but to be honest, the sound quality is not the best. However, they are very comfortable. Overall, I would look elsewhere."
2,rough edges,"I was so excited to finally have my Le Creuset pot. When I opened it, the first thing I noticed was how rough the edges of the pot and lid were. For all that money, I expected better craftsmanship."
4,Another Great Dipset choice.,"Continues the format of great beats and witty wordplay. Juelz is not a great lyricist by any stretch of the imagination, but puts forth a solid effort and handles the great added touch of DJ Green Lanterns expertise on the 1's and 2's. Lots of unreleased music on here from the whole crew. A very good listen."
4,His Name is S.A.N.T.A.N.A.,"Juelz is tight, like he says on the BLCC2 and I quote, ""the difference between us and them is, we us and they them...that says it all! BLCC is crazy and if you are a diplomat fan check it out...He is definitely a preview of the Matrix !2.."
4,AJ 300 (24 years old),"Once again the diplomats member, Juelz Santana represents. Themusic was pretty damn good for a mixtape. I can't wait play it in my car. It was like a freestyle mix cd, with some sampled beats. Buy this cd if you are a true Diplomats fan!!""Dipset all day everyday"""
4,John Barry fan,"I remember watching this movie and hearing the instumental music for the first time. I instantly recognized the music and was drawn to it, like responding to the voice of a dear and long-time friend. I have been a fan of John Barry's music for awhile now, starting with the movie ""Dances with Wolves"", then discovering my favorite ""Somewhere in time"". Buy this CD, if only for the 25 minute insrumental suite by John Barry. It will stir your heart and soul. I look forward to hearing the rest of his music."
3,Indecent Proposal's soundtrack album 50/50,"These days it's hard to find a good movie soundtrack album and most often than not you get the best tracks on a compilation of songs from various movies versus just one in particular. In the case of this soundtrack I found that out of nine songs, only four were good including The Pretenders, Seal, Lisa Stansfield and John Barry's instrumental suite. The other five are not as appealing and I think the addition of Sade on this album would have done a lot to enhance its quality. Most of the songs on here are relatively unknown, even though the singers are very familiar. That doesn't mean the songs are of dubious quality however and these four surely stand out above the rest.If you're looking to add to your soundtrack collection or if you enjoyed the film and its background music, this may not be a bad bet. Enjoy!"
3,Not original,"To whom this may concern,I already sent in my review but I will do it again. Although the music is gennerally the same, the speed of the CD is slower than the original. I don't know much about recording technologies used but something must have gone wrong because clearly you can hear the difference. Especially in the instrumental piece. The color picture of the CD sleeve is of poor quality as well so we can tell this is not an orginal product.Other than that it is better than nothing as the orginal cannot be found anymore.ThanksDavid Benizri"
4,"Great film...more than 1,000,000 dollars",I was looking for this Cd in Argentina but I couldn't find it... Lisa Stanfield and Pretenders the best songs of this movie. I will buy this CD for these songs only ! Monumental...very romantic
1,WHERE are the subtitles?,"I find it misleading and unethical that nowhere on the box (which is in English only) does it indicate that this is a German film in German. Several other reviewers have maintained that this disc does offer English subtitles (again not mentioned on the box), but darned if I can access them. I have tried going to the menu, but when I do, all that happens is the film starts playing again without subtitles. Perhaps those whose remotes have a ""subtitle"" button can get them to play, but they are beyond the reach of my Panasonic DVD player (which was, when I bought it a couple of years ago, top-of-the-line). In addition, as others have noted, the print quality is poor, like a sloppy transfer of a VHS tape. The film itself might be interesting--Alma Mahler as a blonde sexkitten in lace teddy??? Paging Ken Russell!--but apparently one needs special equipment to find the hidden subtitles, without which the film is meaningless."
1,Very boring.,"Extremely boring narration of some extracts of remeniscences/letters of Mahler and about Mahler, narrated by actors impersonating the authors of the recollections. Total waste of time and money."
2,Ich bein eine Berliner?,"If you speak German, you may enjoy this. I don't so ... I don't know what else to say... nice pictures? Looks *very* stylized altho not quite as bizzarre as Ken Russell's piece of trash. Not sure if it's a documentary or cinema."
2,Highlights Disk,"The singing of the two principles (especially Fassbaender) is good and the film looks pretty. But the director compresses the performance to feature film length by deleting every scene that does not involve the two principal singers. This is not a performance of ""Werther""; it is a disk of highlights."
3,Peter Dvorsky,"Peter Dvorsky est une véritable révélation dans le rle de Werther. Il maitrise parfaitement la langue franaise et la tessiture. Il joue avec passion et sa virile beauté contraste avec la sentimentalité du personnage. Brigitte Fassbänder est très belle, sa voix est chaude et colorée mais son franais est incompréhensible. C'est bien dommage.Petr Weigl est un habitué de l'opéra filmé. Sa ""Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk"" avait fait sensation par son érotisme exacerbé, à la limite de la pornographie. Ici, il privilégie la campagne, la nature et les intérieurs germano-bourgeois. Séduisant et convaincant."
3,Dive back into the 60's,"The merit of the book is to provide an affordable compilation of Archigram's images and original text, mostly published on Architectural Design almost forty years ago. While it is disappointing not to have color pictures, the graphics are still compelling and provocative (all done without Photoshop!). It is a very good basic reference book if you are interested in Archigram."
4,archigram review,"that's a pitty not have portuguese language but it is an interesting book.Not only for architects, but to anyone who loves construcion"
3,Useful observations,"This book contains essays prepared for a 1989 lecture series at the Irish Institute for Pastoral Liturgy. They consider the status of liturgy 25 years after Sacrosanctum Concilium. The essays include: Local Church Reception of Conciliar Reform; Women in the Liturgical Assembly; Liturgy: Corporate Public Prayer; Eucharistic Praying and the Good of the Church; Liturgical Language: The Words of Faith; Contemplative Participation;The essays are interesting an occasionally provocative but with the forecoming new liturgical documents and the decade since the confence, the material is becoming more historical and less a contemporary evaluation."
2,just a nice diary,"Small books about Lemare's impressions... He wrote down his troubles, afraid and reminds always in fight with the his living time... collegues, family and organs. Sometime those lines are actual because every musicians, organists, composers found thousand difficulties concerning life and others. Lemare write down a small notes about his feelings concerning materials.. just impressions not else."
3,The Other Boleyn Girl is Better,"Gregory's writing is beautiful but the main character, Hannah, is an idiot. I know Gregory wanted to create Hannah as a ""fool"" in her personal life as well as life at court, but she so truly ridiculous that she is unrealistic. I loved the entire book except ""Hannah"". If you can get past her ongoing and very annoying crush on an unattainable older man and her unfathomable way of constantly putting herself and her family in mortal danger for no real reason, then you might like it. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is much, much better."
3,lack of continuity,"I won't reiterate everything here, but I basically agree with the more negative reviews. I did find her feminist comments way out of character for ANY woman of that time. (One of those ""give me a break!"" moments when reading.) Once I got past the absurdness of how quickly this young girl became such a close confidante to top royalty, (another ""GMAB!"") and just accepted it, I enjoyed it more. In other words, if you can suspend disbelief it's rather entertaining. There were a few inconsistencies, and I spent 10 minutes looking for the first description in the book of Robert Dudley's wife as having brown eyes because later in the book her ""big blue eyes"" are mentioned. How does that get past an editor, much less the author?"
3,The Motley Fool,"""The Queen's Fool"" is the fourth Phillipa Gregory book in this series I have read. The other three were fascinating, informative and page-turning. This one was tedious. Hannah Verde, the protagonist, (aka the Queen's Fool, Mistress Boy, Hannah Green, Hannah Carpenter, My Lord's Vassal and so forth)is a fool indeed. She is the most fickle, unpredictable protagonist imaginable. Hannah loves both Queen Mary (yes, the bloody one) and Princess Elizabeth, which presents a problem because the two are always plotting against one another. She loves Robert Dudley and her husband, Daniel Carpenter. which presents a problem because her loyalties are constantly divided between the two. She loves spending time with her father and spending time at court, which presents a problem because she can't be both places at once. Although the main story is interesting, Hannah seems more like a plot device to keep the story moving than she does a real person."
4,Really fantastic,This one of my favorite books by Gregory and it adds an interesting touch after reading The Other Boleyn Girl and seeing the struggles between Elizabeth and Mary. It was really refreshing to see a different side of Mary portrayed other than the ruthless and demented side that most people would like to paint her as. I also really liked Hannah's personnal life story amidst the splendor and opulence of the Tudor reign. The only thing that I wish had been added was Hannah's visions and portrayals of the future.
4,A Good Book,"I didn't like this book as much as The Other Boleyn Girl. But it's still a good book. Hannah's life at court was interesting but the way she deals with Daniel was typical. It's written like a romance novel...she loves him, she hates him, she lusts for him, she leaves him because of something he did etc. etc.It was not as good as TOBG. I might have liked it better if the book was done from Mary's point of view instead of Hannah's.Overall, it was a decent book and I hope that Ms. Gregory writes more novels during this time period. I'd also like to see some of her older works such as The Wise Woman come into print again. I look forward to her next book."
5,SO AMAZING!!,"This was the best book i have read in a very long time, and i very much reccommend it, this book is mainly about a young jewish girl living in England, and about all the religious struggles between Roman Catholic Queen Mary and Protestant Princess Elizabeth I. Very great if you love the Tudor history."
3,Eh.,"I read ""The Virgin's Lover"" by Gregory and loved it- delightfully smutty and scandalous and really engagingly well written. I picked up this book thinking that I would enjoy it just as much, and realized today that I'm really not enjoying it.Hannah is the vassal of Robert Dudley. He's released her from her duty to him, but because she's in love with him (Why? cause he's, like, a hottie?) he blatantly manipulates her into spying and plotting against a queen she loves. And there's lots of independant girl in a patriarchal period drama with her betrothed.All I can say is meh meh meh."
3,Unsure of my rating.....,"I read the Other Boleyn Girl, and I loved it! So when I found this novel at the store, I purchased it immediately, but I found it dull and not anywhere near the greatness of the Other Boleyn Girl. As other reviews state, I felt the same way that this book seems to have been sloppily put together just to meet a deadline. And Hannah's ever-changing views about the main people in the book, Mary, Elizabeth, Daniel, and Robert are always different. She also seems to switch from hating them to loving them. How can Hannah love someone such as Mary when she is in danger of dying the same way her mother died by just being with the queen because she is a Jew? And I didn't like how they portrayed Elizabeth as some whore and a devious brat. But however, some of the information is pretty accurate, but I recommend this book if you are more of a Mary fan, not a fan of the previous book, the Other Boleyn Girl, because sadly, this book is a disappointment. :("
4,A Good Follow Up to Other Boleyn Girl,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. It was a wonderful follow-up to The Other Boleyn Girl which i could not put down. The character development is done beautifully and draws you in immediately. The historical perspective is tantallizing. Hannah is the type of girl we hope we all have something in common with. She is the perfect combination of foolish yet bright, independant yet naive, progressive yet traditional, and she just wants to be loved...dont we all?"
4,Interesting,"The historical information presented by the book, even the last detail, is extremely accurate. It serves as a history lesson woven into a fascinating storyline. Although the book lacks a structured plot or even a clear struggle for the protagonist, Hannah Green, it follows her adventures and is definitely interesting."
5,An Enthralling Read,"Phillipa Gregory is among the best historical fiction writers of our time.Her portrayals of Robert Dudley,Elizabeth,and the whole of Tudor court life are ingeniusly accurate (I should know,I was there),and I liked the twist on popular opinion...making Mary the good hearted,if not woefully misguided Queen; and Elizabeth aggravating,selfish,dastardly, but above all sphinxlike and clever.Decidedly one of Phillipa's best novels,a wonderfully written romp through the terrors,follies,escapades,and trials of Bloody Mary,the nine day Queen,and Gloriana."
2,Broken Record,"After reading The Other Boleyn Girl, I expected a bit better from Gregory. This novel was however, quite boring. The first half was quite repetative and I found myself highly disliking the protagonist. The phrase ""i am a fool, a holy fool, pretending to be a christian, while still a jew, and a fool"" resurfaced about every other page. I found myself just trying to find a redeeming quality somewhere since I'd already read so much, and in the end, I think it just grew on me, partly because I knew it was finished."
2,Smuts and begged for a fool,"This was my first Philippa Gregory novel and I won't soon pursue another. I found her repetition of images and phrases very off-putting and lacking in verbal imagination.Hannah was 'begged for a fool' so often and even more often 'brushed her face with her fingers as though to remove smuts from a fire' that those usages became very annoying.I understand that fire was supposed to be a powerful symbol in the character's life, but a little less reliance on the same phrasing would have shown more skill on the author's part.I also found the love Hannah professed for Mary unbelievable for a refugee from the Inquisition.Being a fan of Elizabeth, I was not amused by the allusion of her stealing ideas from Mary, e.g. her ascension quote, the idea of being a virgin queen, etc."
3,Just too improbable,"I was a big fan of Philippa Gregory after racing through ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" but here, without the anchor of a real-life main character, Gregory falters . Hannah Green is a secret Jew, who becomes the fool in the court of the Tudors during the 1550's. Hannah is loyal and loving to Queen Mary Todor, is equally fascinated by the vivacious Elizabeth, and has a special relationship with Robert Dudley, Elizabeth's lover. Much more clever people than Hannah become caught in the web of intrique that surrounded the successors to Hanry VIII, but Hannah seems to move effortlessly among the competing courts, shifting her loyalties as circumstances demanded. Several times she is caught in her own little betrayals of those she admires, but seems to be forgiven every time. Gregory is a good writer, and her details of life during this period fascinate, but I thought she strayed too far from reality in ""The Queen's Fool."""
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this book as soon as I finished ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" expecting to be carried away as much as I was in that novel. While the writing style was the same, and I truly enjoyed the descriptions and narrations of Elizabeth I and Queen Mary, I found the heroine, Hannah (Verde) Green, to be a bit of a stretch. Unlike Mary Boleyn in ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" Gregory seems to have sold out to the romance novel ideal in attempting to set a 21st Century girl in 16th century England. It doesn't work in tawdry romance novels and it doesn't work here. The novel is a quick read and does hold interest, but I really wish that Gregory had made her heroine more true to her time. It would have continued the magic of her other novel. A good escapist read, and some interesting perceptions of two of England's most interesting monarchs, but not as engrossing as ""The Other Boleyn Girl."""
4,Queen Mary,"I really enjoyed that this book let you see into the world of both Mary and Elizabeth. Often books center around Princess (Queen) Elizabeth, and while she is in this book most of the writing talks about a girls life during Mary's Reign. I really enjoyed it."
4,"Good, but...","not as entertaining as The Other Boleyn Girl or the Boleyn Inheritence. However, a good read!"
2,Just ok for me!,"I love most of Philippa's novels, but this one was slow and didn't do much for me...."
5,A Fool No More,"Another drama of the Tudors by Philippa Gregory. I enjoyed this one more than ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" because the main character had spunk and independence, unusual for a girl in those days. Although a vassal to a Lord with his own agenda, she developed a deep love for Queen Mary and was a loyal friend to her through all her suffering. For the first time, I got a clear picture of the conflict between Mary and Elizabeth before and after the death of their young brother the King. Both made huge mistakes but were strong women to be reckoned with. Hannah serves both but is still her own woman. Very exciting events unfold as the balance of power shifts back and forth between these two woman and their supporters. Adding to the drama is the fact that Hannah and her family are Jews passing as Christians during a time when heretics were burned at the stake."
4,Tudor Historical Fiction,"This historical fiction was another great Tudor novel of Philippa Gregory. It takes place in 1553 with Queen Mary I in power. She has married King Phillip of Spain, but he has eyes for her half sister, Elizabeth. Earl Robert Dudley is also entranced by Elizabeth, who is the daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. The story centers around a ficticious character, Hannah Greene. Hannah has been on the run with her father as Jewish refuges from Spain during the Inquisition. They run a book store, selling religious and forbidden books, not allowed by the very devout Catholic Queen Mary. It is an interesting perspective, having the story told through Hannah's eyes. Hannah has allegiances to both Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth. This is an interesting and fast-paced read."
5,GREGORY'S BEST SO FAR,"The plot was a unique concept but very well written. A young refugee, Jewish, ends up in the Queen's court and favored by both Mary and Queen Elizabeth. (knowing the intrigue made this just a little less plausible)I was utterly caught up in this book and upon finishing it stayed with me for some time. It's the best book I've read this year and one of the author's very very best."
3,So so,"I found it difficult to like or even to care much about any of the characters in this book and their various travails. The two queens were self-indulgent and self-centered to the point of being annoying. The fool was . . . I guess the best discription is an adolescent inflicted with hero worship and a total lack of common sense. I wish the author had continued the story into her life after she finally grew up . . . where did they go, what did they do after she finally left the poisonous atmosphere of the English court, how did she compromise with her inlaws. It was just beginning to get interesting when the author lost interest in the story."
4,The Reign of Mary Tudor,"Another great work of historical fiction from Gregory.This book focuses on the reign of Mary Tudor, the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon (Henry's first wife). The story is told from the viewpoint of a young female servant, who gets drawn into the court and the politics and plots that surround it.I have read other books set in this time period in England, and Gregory managed to tell the story in a way that was fresh and entertaining.If you are interested in the period, or a fan of Gregory's you'll enjoy this one. If you want to read her books in historical order, here it is:1. The Constant Princess (Katherine of Aragon)2. The Other Boleyn Girl (Anne Boleyn)3. The Boleyn Inheritance (Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard)4. The Queen's Fool (Mary Tudor and Elizabeth I)5. The Virgin's Lover (Elizabeth I)6. The Other Queen (Mary Queen of Scots)"
1,Some bright spots in the disbelief,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring."
4,great book!,I read The Other Boleyn Girl by the same author and loved it.This book is just as good. It will grab your interest from the first page and keep it until the last page.
5,A facinating perspective,"The Queen's Fool is the story of Queen Mary and her step sister Queen Elizabeth told from the perspective of a young Jewish girl trying to hide in plain site from the Inquisition as the Queen's Fool. The historical references, while maybe not always completely acurate, are always authentic and believable. This book made me think about Queen Elizabeth in a whole new way. I strongly recommend it."
5,Couldn't put it down!!,I loved this book. It kept me entertained. I continue to recommend to anyone that enjoys novels based in history. Loved it!!
4,The Queen's Fool,"I thought this book was really really good. The only problem I had with it was the amount of talking...talk talk talk. My favorite parts were Hannah's time with Daniel and his family. I had never read into Queen Mary I's life before, so I found that interesting too...although I just wanted Hannah to hurry up and realize that Daniel was in love with her! But, overall it was a very good book and only took me three days to read it!"
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I absolutely loved The Other Boleyn Girl, and was really looking forward to The Queen's Fool. However, I found the book ridiculously far-fetched with the ""Sight"" business, and very historically inaccurate as well. As a serious student of the Tudors, I found several laughable errors in this book, and though it is a work of historical fiction, such obvious errors do detract from the story. The Other Boleyn Girl was a vastly superior work to this one, which seems like it was thrown together hastily to meet a deadline. The ending seems to set up a sequel -- please Ms. Gregory, don't bother."
2,Informational soap opera,"Phillipa Gregory gives you a lot of historical information. However, this novel was so redundant that she could have deleted more than 50 pages.It is a few steps highter than Danielle Steele."
5,How can I like this more than Philippa Gregory's Boleyn stories??,"I don't know how it's possible that I liked ""The Queen's Fool"" even more than ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", and ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" which I loved. I think it's partially the addition of Hannah Green the young jewish girl escaping the Spanish Inquisition and becoming the Queen's Fool, telling the story. Having Hannah tell the story introduces how great an effect all the european countries and their politics have on other European countries.I am sure it is also the fact that these stories build on each other, with characters whose families and circumstances are already familiar from the book before. I encourage you to read in sequence - and I encourage you to READ these stories and learn some history. Even if it is couched in some fiction, you still learn and this way is so much more fun. My friends are now as hooked as I am -- this many people can't all be wrong."
2,A good read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I am an avid reader who reads a lot of different types of books and this was a new direction for me. I do have to say that you should read ""The Other Bolyn Sister"" before reading this book. This book has some reference to characters that tie in with each story. All in all it was entertaining and had some great twists and turns that kept me guessing."
2,Very disappointing,"Like many others, I bought this as soon as I put down THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL. I pretty much wish I had my money back. Hannah is not a likeable character and the writing seems very surface level. I did emphathize with Mary but that was about it. I am giving Gregory another chance with WIDEACRE but I think I may have to stick to Robin Mawell or Sandra Gulland for historical fiction."
2,Improbable story accompanied with bad grammar,"I found the incorrect grammar coming from the characters (and the author) very off putting. The story while interesting put people in situaations that could not possibly happen. I'm really surprised the publlishers allowed the bad grammaar to come from the queen, the Lords, and the author.Lillian Belinfante Herzberg, author (see my reviews)"
4,I really liked this.,"It's a good story; quite an interesting tale. Plus, you get a little refresher course in history without even realizing it!"
4,Captivating,"At first I wasn't sure where this was going, but then I couldn't put it down. I had read ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", so some of the references were familiar. I'm sure it's not all literal truth, but I feel like I have learned more about English history and it makes me want to know more."
3,Good history; weak characters; contrived ending,"There were definitely things I liked about this book such as the portrayal of Queen Mary, life at and away from the court, and the ""secret"" life of the Jews. The background of the book seems very accurate and well researched and consistent with other books of this time period. However, the narrator Hannah Green just does not seem believable. The fact that Hannah seems to easily find herself in the position to be ""selected"" to become the queen's fool is a bit of a stretch. Her relationship with Daniel while still maintaining the role of an intimate friend of both Mary and Elizabeth seems also very improbable.This is the only book I've read by Philippa Gregory; I'm not sure I'll pick up another one. This was a light entertaining read, but it does not stand up to the works of Jean Plaidy"
4,Tracie Hunter,"This is Ian Hunter's daughter, for all those who didn't know. She's got a sexy voice and lyrical talent, and I'm surprised she wasn't signed to a label sooner. It's a great album; get it!"
4,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MAC G3 - SO BE CAREFUL,"My daughter played this game at a local computer store, and really liked it, so she got it for her birthday. It was very disappointing to discover that she cannot play it, because we have a G3 iMac, and you need to have a G4. This is mentioned in small print on the packaging, but it would be nice if it were mentioned on the Amazon site as well, so people would know before they order whether it will run on their computer or not. My daughter doesn't want to return the game, she really likes it, so we'll just have to wait until we upgrade our computer at some point."
1,Only THREE levels???????,"Great graphics for sure but after I ccompleted the third level, it said MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. After three levels?! Just three levels? Are you kidding me?! Buyers beware!"
1,old school,Did not offer me anything more than I learned in high school 40 years ago. I was disappointed. I would not recommend this book for anyone who is looking for some insight to better customer service on the phone.
1,Less than entry-level book - too basic for anyone who already can use a phone,"I was very dissapointed with this book - it features extremely basic information about customer service and phone skills. The books stresses that the phone should be answered quickly, politely and that the CSR should listen to the caller. They recommend taking complete messages, calling back promptly and trying to sound positive when saying ""no"".I believe I learned all of that from my mom and dad when I was 8. It was not worth the $10.95, and I won't be buying any titles from this series or publisher again - it just isn't new or useful information."
2,Down with the up rules!,The rules were interpreted - the initial game played. Will probably never play again. You are crossing arms with your opponent to place the drawn tile at the head of their column. It's messy and screws up response times.
3,Itchy Skin but it works.,I have been taking the Maxi-Hair vitamin for about three weeks. I itch like crazy....but my nails are growing and are as hard as acrylic nails (which comes in handy for the itching). Not a lot of diff. in hair or skin. I would really like to stick it out for awile to see if I get more results but the itching is almost unbearable.
2,Upset my stomach,"I tried the Maxi-Hair vitamins based on other reviews. I am not satisfied w/results, caused upset stomach and no noticeable differences in hair or nails. I would not purchase these again. Plan to return to Phytophanere capsules again and take w/Biotin and zinc supplements."
4,Great way to spruce up your stove!,"These match my dishes. I have an electic stove and they help make it look very nice. Also, I have limited counter space, so they make a nice surface on my stove to work in the kitchen. You have to make sure you take them off the stove before heating the oven! They can discolor and burn!"
4,Diamonds,"Who doesn't like diamonds? This was a fun, small book of old and new tiaras. I liked the format and the way the book was layed out."
1,Not so speedy,"Waited until after the last date that was listed to receive item. Contacted seller, they were then quick about getting it to me. I think I fell through a crack somewhere."
1,So Sad,"I was really exited to get an honest to goodness grown up sewing machine. I thought I would be getting a good deal, after all my vaccuum cleaner by the same co. works just fine. The first machine's automatic needle threading was misaligned. The decorative stitches worked okay though. So I had my husband exchange it. The second machine threaded like it promised, but the decorative stitches weren't so decorative. I'm quite dissapointed and returning this machine as well. I'm wondering if it's just luck of the draw on how well your machine works."
1,Lack of Service,"I bought the machine at Target a week ago and took it home and started learning it right away. I was very pleased with what I tried. But when I tried to change the bobbin, there was no instruction on how to remove the cover to it. I figured it out. Then when I went to put on a new bobbin in the bobbin threader, the tiny ""spring pin"" broke immediately. We tried to fix it ourselves, but couldn't. Tried to call the company, but the phone is constantly busy. No address to even write or send it back to. It has a 25-year warranty, but it's no good if you can't get service!! I'm bringing it back to Target."
1,Lemon???,"I made a BIG mistake! I purchased this machine over 6 months ago knowing that my 30+ year old Kenmore was going to die at any time. Today I finally opened the box, took out the machine, plugged it in and - NOTHING. No power; just a whining sound from the machine. I tried everything I could think of to get this machine to power-up. Of course, I can't find my receipt anywhere and will just have to live with the fact that I spent the price to keep a boxed machine under my sewing cabinet. Live and learn - I'm not usually so stupid. I'll try to return it to Target and see if they will exchange it for something else - it WON'T be another Shark Intell-Sew!! Consumer Reports recommend (1/05 issue) the Brother machines - pricier @ $500, but very high reviews. I'm off to buy a Brother......."
5,SEWING MACHINE,THIS WAS MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT. I LOVE IT. IT HAS SO MANY FEATURES. THE SHIPPING WAS FAST. IT HAS DIFFERENT STYLE LETTERS BUT I WISH THEY CAME IN DIFFERENT SIZES (LIKE 2INCHES IN SIZE) BUT I'M HAPPY. IT'S A PERFECT MACHINE. IT TAKES CLEAR PLASTIC BOBBINS WHICH YOU CAN PRACTICALLY BUY ANYWHERE. THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT I CAN'T POINT OUT BUT OVERALL IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE WITH EASY TO USE FEATURES. I'M VERY SATISFIED.
1,Don't buy any Euro Pro products!!,"I have had my Euro Pro Intelli-Sew 9110 for barely over a year. 4 months ago, the lamps went out and I have not been able to get them replaced. No one repairs Euro Pro (I live just outside of Washington, DC so sewing machine repair places are thick on the ground here) because their customer service and repair service just reeks. You can't get parts, you can't get them repaired and they don't work after a while. Mine just started jamming in the feed dogs today (I cleaned it out and there is no dust or lint evident) and I know I won't get any help if I call Euro Pro. The price is good, but the service stinks. I'll never buy another and the one I own now is going for garbage on Tuesday. Grrrrrrrrrrrr. I'm going to buy another Pfaff or Bernina from now on."
3,computer nightmare,"This was my third machine and was hopeful that it would be the best. Now that I have been using it for less than a year it has started jamming and caused the computer to malfunction. I had no trouble getting customer service only to find out that they have no repair places around to go to for warrenty work. They want you to pay all the postage and mail it to them in NY and cannot tell you how long the machine will be there, but did stress a month at least. They said it would be spendy because of the weight so I went to a local shop and the estimate to reset the computer is $125. I about fell over and am so disappointed in the lack of service you get. If it happens again its in the trash!"
1,Don't buy Euro Pro sewing machine 9110,"Don't waist your money on this machine. I purchased one two years ago and it has been sent back for repair twice and it is broken again-same thing,it won't take up the bobbin thread!The last time I sent it back, it took them three months to send it back to me. Customer service is very rude!I won't bother sending this one back. I haven't even worked five hours on it!Please don't waist your money and time!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,This item is a total lemon - check out all the sites on this and read the reviews before you purchase - I wam sorry I did not. After a few times sewing the bobbin holder will pop out of the machine and get the thread all tangled up in it and you can no longer sew. The holder no longer stays in place - professionals cannot fix it because they say the machine is like paper in the inside a total waste of money. Really it is crap - don't be fooled and Euro Pro does not even answer their phones or make the product anymore. So parts or any help is not available. Really a total joke!
1,lemon from hell,"I bought one, yes the bobbin wouldn't catch...just like all the other reviews. So, I returned it. Same thing. Blew the motor in a week and the bobbin wouldn't catch. Decorative stitches only work on 2 speed. I have worked in the design field and this sucks. I plan on returning this one to get a third and sell it before I break it again. Don't bother with customer service. All they do is tell you it cost $40 to fix under warranty and $15.95 to ship it."
4,The technique works,"The previous reviewer, who chose to remain anonymous, clearly has not tested Alphee's methods. They work. Enough said."
1,Lose this book before you find it,"An ignorant mish-mash of pseudo-astrological ""wisdom"" that should be given a miss by anyone really wanting to learn this subject. Lavoie's prose reflects his uneducated background, and he lacks the sharpness, clarity, ethics, and insight that so many other, far more articulate and informed astrologers have on this subject. Try books by Anthony Louis, Karen Hamaker-Zondag, or Mark Edmund Jones--Lavoie is primarily a salesman of software and books, and a frequent lecturer at astrological conventions--but those who know indicate that he is unable to deliver the goods as a horary astrologer. Give this book a miss and go after one of the many other fine books on the subject offered by Amazon.com"
3,sastified,I purchased this necklace for my teenage son and he really liked it. The necklace was good quality for the price. We were definitely satisfied with the purchase.
4,"Nice Quality, well-designed","Nice quality, well-designed simple baby finger toothbrush. I bought a few different brands of these (all of which are good) to try for brushing my cats teeth - turned out to be easier for me to use a small, thin toothbrush and gauze squares for that purpose, but your mileage may vary. I gave away the unused finger toothbrushes to friends with babies - some liked them, some preferred the thin toothbrush and gauze square method for baby. Decent product at a good price."
4,Easy to use,"My babies (4 months old) love this! they both laugh when I brush their gums. The only thing I can say is wrong with this is that it's a little small, I have to use my pinky with it. =)"
2,almost useless,"wont even fit my pinky finger way to small,had to slit it almost completely to use at all. I got these to brush my miniature Dachshunds teeth all the finger brushes or finger brush gloves seem to be made for very small hands and don't state on any packaging I have found size at all."
2,"decent, but too expensive.",This product is ok. I've found cheaper with a case and you definitely need a case for it. I ended up cleaning my sons gums in the bath with a cloth. It ended being a very random bath toy.
4,This is a well written and researched book,"This really is a great book. The author gices only the breifest description of the political events that preceded the war, but does go into a detailed description of the difference between the Prussian staff system and the Austrian old style system. The book concludes by showing how the Prussian staff system influenced the Germans in makeing their decisions through WW II. The only problem is that the maps were not clearly prepared. I found that this made the book somewhat hard to follow. In the paperback version that I have, the type size was somewhat small and hard to read. As the author was only able to use the Austrian achives, the Prussian archives were destroyed in WW II, he was able to go into more depth on the Austrian side of the war than the Prussian side."
4,1866,"There is only one way to describe this book, serviceable. If you are interested in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, this book will appeal to you. Of course the issue of the war was not minor. The decision as to who would dominate the as yet divided states of Germany was decided, and Bismark's design for a united Germany under Prussian domination moved one step closer. The First World War became a little more inevitable with the Prussian victory, and also the fatal weakness of Austria, the ally in the Great War that the Prussia had defeated 38 years earlier, moved closer to becoming an albatross around Germany,s neck. Understand, however, that this book is primarily a military history of the war. You will find material here on the campaign against Prussia's junior ally Italy, the major actions between Austria and Prussia, and a two chapter treatment of Koniggratz. The naval aspects of the war are not covered and you will find no discussion of Lissa here."
3,Illegible,"I have no wish to criticise the writer- I moved on to this book after being very impressed by his work on the Franco-Prussian War, but I bought the paperback over the Internet and was shocked when it arrived- the print is very small and I had to struggle to read it with a magnifying glass. Cambridge should be ashamed of producing such a volume."
4,Music for Christmas,I bought this so that by Christmas the grandkid will be familiar with the music.
5,Great right out of the box,"I primarily used this item to transfer several types of media to DVD. Two types of camcorder tapes and VHS home movies were easily copied to the hard drive, then edited on screen, them burned to DVD. This unit has lots of features so reading through the owners manual to figure it all out was something I was not used to doing. The on screen editing is very straight forward once you read about it. I was very impressed with how my old 8mm and mini-DV tapes looked after moving them to DVD. I haven't used all the features yet, but look forward to it.This unit only used DVD's that are DVD-R or DVD-RW."
5,Sylvania VCR / DVD combo player / recorder,We just needed a simple to use DVD / VCR combo playing / recording device for our kids and for us. This product is great. Simple to install. It does exactly what it says. For somebody who is technically challenged like myself I just needed something I could plug and not have to worry about complicated operating instructions. I would highly recommend this product and am very pleased with our purchase.
4,Sylvania HDV200F,"This refurbished DVD/VCR has worked quite well and gives a lot of flexibility for viewing different media. The 160GB hard drive is a great way to record without the degredation in the media, over time, as you have with VCR tapes. The added benefit of better resolution makes viewing a pleasure. So far, the system has been fairly easy to use."
1,trouble prone,"I bought this unit to replace a failed VCR. It sounded like it had some great features, 80 gig hard drive built-in, DVD to tape transfers, etc. It does. The only problem is the only ones I could find were refurbished. And it was defective, most likely never even tested. I waited until after our vacation to set it up. Big mistake. Turns out the clock does not work, making it useless except as a player. And the reseller has a 30 day return policy, so I just threw away $145 on a piece of junk!"
2,1 disc player worked sporadically,Looks nice and has nice features. I typically don't write review but in this case I had to return the stereo because disc 1 did not work. The player at times just would not recoginize and play a disc in disc 1. The doors had to be openned and closed for it to work then the tracks would still cut in and out. I've returned this one for a replacement. I hope this one works better!
4,great for the money,"I bought this system for my 11 year old for christmas and she loves it. The sound is good for the price. However, you can only adjust the sound by preset format (rock, classical, pop or flat). It is sleek looking but make sure you have a place to put it, as it is tall. You can play a different CD within a few seconds. For the money it is a good deal. The remote is good too."
4,Wonderful,I think this book is perfect for the children who may not be quite ready for the more compex words used in the Harry Potter series.
5,Ram Ram Ram Ram,"Another wonderful set of cd's from Krishna Das. The chanting is beautiful, the music sublime...It doesn't get any better than this. Another beautiful CD from a Master. My fiance and I have gotten addicted to Krishna Das & listen to his CD's every morning. You can't explain perfection.....you just listen and enjoy."
5,The Yoga King,"This CD also came with a DVD showing Das performing and commenting on his work. You meet his wife and daughter (who sings harmony with Das). For those that love this music this is top notch. Once you see the DVD, it probably will remain in storage, but the music/chants are excellent"
3,disappointed,The music is ok very much the same thing over and over again! Also there are two cds in the case one of the cds was blank!
5,Warp Speed Path to the Divine!,"Ram Dass introduced me to chanting in the mid 80's...now I am completely immersed in the way Kirtan opens me to the sacred light within. I suppose it's no coincidence that all my most beloved teachers are connected through KD's Guru, Neem Karoli Baba (Ram Dass, Hilda Charlton)You can feel the love and devotion pouring out of Krishna Das throughout this CD! The DVD documentary is a jewel as well...and then when you think it can't get any better, the live Kirtan gives your soul wings. I feel the Divine Mother flow through me more powerfully each time I play the Kirtan DVD...I use it as part of my daily spiritual practice, sometimes dancing in bliss.Whether you are new to Krishna Das or a longtime fan, this CD and DVD are worth the money ten times over."
2,Rodyne Yee ABS Yoga Abs for Beginners,Think it is mostly stretching and not getting much of a workout to tighten abs.
1,Lame even for beginners,"This is by far the most lame yoga video I ever tries. It runs for less than 20 minutes. I thought I was just warming up and it was already over. Really a let down. I own a Rodney Yee video , and I was expecting this to be more ab focused. But there was nothing in this other than a few simple leg and spine stretches."
3,Didn't even break a sweat!,This video is too easy. It was so short and easy that I didn't even break a sweat and I am far from in shape.
1,Never buy from dvdlegacy again!!,I purchased this dvd back in february and seller was paid for it. I have never received the item. I have emailed the seller over six times and have received no response back
5,yoga dvd,Great product for those serious about getting back in shape.Not for someone excessively over weight.
4,a great ab strengthener!,This is a great ab workout but I think Rodney's cueing could be a little better. After doing this tape once I let it sit unused for about a year and a half and now I have that I have started using it again I can really appreciate the poses. To explain...I have done both The Bar Method and Lotte Berk workouts and both have similarites in the ab portion to this tape in that you have to hold your back really up off the floor and hollow the belly. The other tapes really stress that you keep your ribs up off the floor and that makes all the difference in the integrity of the pose. Rodney does not really stress this point. I like this one because even though you are working the abs it is very relaxing and it's a great one to do after a really brisk walk.
1,SLOW!,"I own several Rodney Yee yoga DVDs that I enjoy but I was very disappointed with this one. It was just SO slow and I am a yoga beginner. During watching the DVD, I kept wondering when we would get going only to find that it already reached its end. Since it felt like I hadn't done any exercise at all, I ended up working out to one of my other exercise DVDs..."
1,"Boring, slow, more meditation video than abs workout","Though I can do intermediate yoga & pilates video, I see the value of beginner workouts. However, this workout is sooo slow. And there is virtually no working out. I thought at first the video was just doing a warm up but the whole video is like a really slow meditative warm up/cool down. Very disappointed and total waste of money. I cannot imagine anyone really reaping any noticeable benefits from doing this video except for maybe lowered blood pressure or lowered stress levels."
4,"Only done this once, but can already feel it!","I just received this DVD in the mail two days ago and just did the routine yesterday for the first time. I woke up this morning and I could definitely feel it in my abs--not too painful, just a pleasant burn to prove I worked them harder than I generally do :-) The routine itself is short enough to do even if you're a little rushed for time, and it didn't feel strenuous, even to a yoga beginner like me."
4,Classic early Monty Python,"It seems as though the Python troupe was still feeling their way in some of these early shows. Though the good stuff is really, really funny, a couple of the skits--though humorous--simply drag on a bit too long. But overall, this is classic Monty Python; very silly. [wink wink, nudge nudge, know what I mean?]"
5,Completely Different,"Imagine what the English viewer must have thought when the Python group was first presented to them. It had to be something completely different than the regular programming on the BBC. Although many of their jokes and stylings have since been copied by comedians and comedy shows everywhere, the DVD is still alot of fun and the sketches seem fresh. Even though I know just about every line by heart, there are many quick jokes that I get now that I'm older that may have gone over my head back then. The sound was always awful when I watched the PBS broadcasts, but the sound as well as picture on the DVDs is great. I have gladly started to record over my long treasured VHS tapes since now I can replace them all with these nicely packaged sets."
4,Fact checking,"All professional writers check their facts--here are some things for another review writer to ponder before subjecting us to yet another ""top"" review:President Nixon was elected in 1968.The first manned moon landing took place during Apollo 11.John Lennon was born in 1940.The Beatles broke up in 1970.Best to get your facts straight *before* publishing. Obvious errors detract from credibility."
1,A complete waste of time and money!,"Misleading title! Nothing about Java. The book tells you how to use the <APPLET> tag in your HTML-page - thats all. I simply dont understand how it is possible to fill a whole book with nonsense, while the only usable stuff would fit in one or two pages!"
1,"This Book is not for Programming, or for Applets","I got this book thinking I was going to learn java. Great right? Well not, I soon figured out this book is about using someone elses applet, on the web! First of all This book has nothing to do with programming! Second of all, If you wanted to have applets on your web-site, why can't you learn to make your own, instead copying off of someone else?"
1,Nothing about Java language; only how to configure applets,Title is misleading. Deals with applet parameters used in HTML documents; not the Java language. Tells reader that Java language and Java script are too hard to deal with. Text is endlessly repetitive; could be reduced to a few pages of HTML-oriented guidance.
1,don't waste time or money on this book,I bought this book because I want to teach myself Jave - the book might be useful for a C++ programmer or someone who wants to do web pages but it has no useful information for a novice Java programmer. Don't buy this book.
2,this is not programming,"i thought this was a programming book and i could learn commands etc and syntaxes etc of java language but this book has no commands or does not treat java as a language but as a tool and says you can use java in webpages without a single line of code!i did not read the book though once surfing through the pages i came to know it is not a programmers book,not a java programming starters tool!maybe i have to buy another book to learn programming!this may not be what you think it is!"
1,almost utterly useless,"First of all, this book is not actually about java programming, it's about puting applets on your web page. There isn't a line of java code anywhere. It is not very well written and it is way too long for its topic. With all the <embed>s and <objects> nowadays, putting applets on your page is hard, but not that hard. Who wants to read several chapters on passing parameters to an applet when you don't kno how to make the applet recieve them? Who wants to pay someone to program for them, like it suggests, when they know how to program begginer HTML anyway? And you would think they would wake the title different, or at least mention in the first chapter that this book is not actually about java programming. Big rip-off."
1,"Should be called ""How to use the Applet Tag in HTML""",I missed the part that stated that this book was not for programming. It should have been more than 2 words in the synopsis of the book. The whole book (mostly) was how to use the <APPLET> tag. So not what I was looking for.
3,it's very british,"(no real spoilers)I was going to write out a huge review but it doesn't really matter. The movie is cheap to rent and it's really not that bad. You may in fact find it entertaining.I never cared about the characters, nor the weak premise, nor the British view of firearms where they are not a weapon so much as a plot device, nor the sudden jerk of horror and gore after an hour of watching Grandma make sandwiches.I turned it off 75% of the way through when they did the dance sequence. I could write out the rest of the movie because I'm absolutely positive I know where it goes now and frankly I just don't care enough about the characters to watch it.There are worse ways you could spend your time. Not many, but there are."
2,Yuck,"Sorry..not my thing. The British have a way in making a movie that is not only not entertaining but ..freakish! I agree with the review above about their abhorrence of ""guns"". Well, the movie is more dangerous than any gun..a gun can be rightly used as a defensive weapon. This movie...well...who can protect us from it? Oh yeah...turn it off. Just not my thing, I guess."
3,An interesting piece of the puzzle,"By far not the best Hooters album, it does have its moments and it is interesting to hear Mindy Jostyn with the band. Her voice and fiddle gives the band a slightly interesting difference. However, the songs are not as strong as other projects. Still, the Hooters on an average day are better than most bands on their best days. This is an interesting piece of the puzzle that is the Hooters' career."
5,Excellent Product!,"This is a great showerhead! I had one in my old house and it was great. We recently moved out to the country and are on a well with low water pressure. I had to search to find this head again, but finally I did through Amazon. It is not only a water saver, but it also restored my water pressure, even when we are running the wash machine and dish washer at the same time. Unfortunately it is discontinued, but maybe someday I will be able to find another to fit the other shower in the house."
1,couldn't prove it by me!,"I see this rated as 5-stars and sure don't know how.Only once, in many attempts, I have even managed to get this game to start. I still don't know how it started that one time.Even with the patch installed, I keep locking up when the screen says ""initializing..."".I think there's some visual c+ error but I can't even see the pop up. I can't use ctrl-alt-del even to get out of the software. The only thing I can do is turn my whole pc off.How I got past the c+ error one time is still a mystery and when I did, you can believe I wasn't over impressed with what little I saw."
3,New Softer Version,"Years ago I always had a pair of Dr. Scholl's to wear in the summer. When you wear a wooden shoe there is very little give and your feet get tired. I was very excited to find the new softer version. I have only had mine for a day. If I have trouble like the other reviewers, I will change my review.*****This is a year later and I'm changing my rewiew. I suggest that you buy a traditional pair of Dr. Scholl's. These shoes are smaller than the size you think you are getting, they run narrow as well. The first week I wore these shoes the heel was nearly worn out. I had only walked from the parking lot to work and back.I still have these shoes and still wear them, but they are worn into the body of the shoe. The insole liner peeled off and the next layer is beginning to come off as well. They still feel good and look good from the top.Jill VanderwoodAuthor: Stowaway: The San Francisco Adventures Of Sara, The Pineapple CatThrough the Rug"
2,"Cute, But Not Well Made","Very disappointing and not recommended. These look great, but are not Dr. Scholl's standard quality. They are just slightly narrower than the usual medium width, making the them less than totally comfortable. In addition, the sole lining is very thin and it detached from both shoes. This was only after maybe six month's indoor-only wear. These shoes have been sent to the trash can and have been replaced with Dr. Scholl's 2.0 sandal."
2,Too narrow,Dr. Scholl's know for their comfortable shoes. These are comfy for the front of the foot but not for sides and back. If you have a narrow foot these would work for you.
3,A tight fit,"Seems to be a great shoe, runns a bit small and tight so if you dont have norrow feet or your feet are flat prob. wont fit other than that nice shoe"
2,Don't waste your money on monster HDMI cables,The cable works but it is far too much money. I have since purchased cables through amazon for around 10 bucks and they work great. I have been using these inexpensive cables for two years and have had no problems. I currently keep this monster cable as a back up or in case I need to connect a new component.
1,"no difference in quality, just price","digital cables transmit a series of zeros and ones to an output source - usually your television or stereo. they either do that...or they don't. there is no quality loss or gain from the cheap or expensive cables, respectively. in other words, a cable either works flawlessly and as well as any other cable, or its broken. find the cheapest HDMI cable with the distance you need, and that's the best cable you can buy."
1,Digital vs Analog,"Regarding your decision whether to drop $300 on an 8 foot cable for a digital signal... it really will not make a difference. With a digital signal, the receiving end only has to tell the difference between ON and OFF - if the signal comes over as 4.9v instead of 5v; or varies a little; it makes literally absolutely 0 difference in picture quality as it's still interpreted correctly as a 1 or a 0; and then the bits are assembled into a visual image. At the point where the receiver is getting confused between an ON and an OFF signal over an 8ft cable run... is the point where you should be checking that your dog is not chewing on your cable. (And not that your cable is not ""nitrogen bubble micro-injected"" or doesn't have ""twin neuro-demagnatronizing halon super-cores"")"
1,HDMI cables are ALL THE SAME regardless of price,"digital cables transmit a series of zeros and ones to an output source - usually your television or stereo. they either do that...or they don't. there is no quality loss or gain from the cheap or expensive cables, respectively. in other words, a cable either works flawlessly and as well as any other cable, or its broken. find the cheapest HDMI cable with the distance you need, and that's the best cable you can buy."
3,Great Pictures,This book has beautiful pictures of finished products and beading demonstrations/tips. It is a good source of color schemes and patterns. It could provide more pattern guides but the ones it does show are clear and easy to follow. Great book for new ideas and projects to do.
3,Includes purses,"When I first received the book I was happy to see that the instructions were clear in how to set up the beginners loom. I gave it 3 stars because some of the items in the book need different looms to complete the projects. Also there is a page in the beginning that shows an assortment of items (some of which I would love to make) that there are no directions for. I'm sort of disappointed, but I do like the beaded purses."
2,it seemed like a good idea at the time...,The Half ball was soooooo appealing to me for what i shoot that I sold my old sticks and bought a complete package with the adjustable half ball. It unfortunately compromised a lot of my shots by slipping and jerking. not a lot but when shooting stuff you don;t get a second chance with I would not recommend the particular half ball. Get one in the legs that's a bit more reliable...
2,Much ado about nothing,"I was very disappointed when I realized how short the interview was and how little it contained. The main issue was about Andrew's former drinking problems, which I wasn't aware of. However, I like Andrew so much that the dvd gets two stars. Don't bother to buy it. Buy one of Andrew's great films instead."
3,Good but not great,I would use this book as a starting point but would use other sources for a complete review. Lots of question included in this book. I passed the test on my first try but used several sources to study from including this book. Beware of the test. It is very hard and has lots of tricky questions.
3,"A Good Book, but the CD isn't from MeasureUp","One of the reviewers has said ""The book in itself is Ok, but the CD has practice questions from MeasureUp and they want $89 for their practice exam... So for less that $20 for the book, you get $89 worth of practice exam... Good deal"".I bought the book based on this advice. Unfortunately the CD contains only the questions from the book, and the book clearly states this. The test engine is from MeasureUp, NOT the questions.The questions in the book are arranged by the objectives, and that helps me memorize the facts. (Yes, you do need to memorize a few things)."
2,I have an issue with several of the answers to questions,"This book is good for quizzing yourself but is it really that great if some of the answers are totally wrongFor example under objective 4.2.3 Authentication question #3 isWhich of the following provides for Authentication, Key Distribution Services, and Single Sign-On(SS0)?A.PKI, B. CA, C.VPN or D. HoneypotThe answer according to the book is Krypto-Knight...WTF?????? Its not even one of the choices!I'll just use the actual Exam Cram book instead of the practice questions as there are too many errors to name."
2,Explanations for answers are EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL.,"Only buy this if you are looking for questions, and do not want an explanation as to why you get the answers wrong. When you get the answers wrong, the explanation will simply tell you what the correct response was, with absolutely no insight whatsoever."
1,British Military History Deserves Better,"This is not a very good book. It consists of three parts, apparently strung together to justify being published as a book. The first part is a confusing list of Victoria Cross winners. The second part is a poorly written short biography of a Zulu War VC winner. The third part is an anthology of first-person accounts previously published in a magazine. With so many good books on the market, one could better spend one's money elsewhere."
5,ALLYSON IS WATCHING & SO AM I,"I wasn't aware of Jennifer Hammon or anything about the soap opera PORT CHARLES before this, but based on the reviews I read here... I just had to check it out.I was not disappointed! Jennifer Hammon is a beautiful woman and the movie is incredibly steamy. Yet, more importantly, unlike most erotic edged movies, it has a substance and a believablity. The character of Allyson (Played by Hammon) is realistic and complex. Too often, the people in these sort of movies are such push overs. So easily convinced into... well, bed. Allyson is realistic, conflicted and therefore creates a successful and very erotic, erotic film.I'd have to say, ALLYSON IS WATCHING, ranks as one of my top 5 sexiest movies."
4,Worth Buying,"Okay I read the other reviews and I said to myself hey their talking about the women that used to be on Port Charles. So I said to myself she was attractive, let me check this out. Gentlemen if you are familiar with Port Charles and you remember Jennifer Hammon this is a MUST buy. Her performance is definitely arousing to say the least, and she showed more than I though you could show in a movie rated less than an X. The video story was actually pretty good and easy to sit through. I thought the movie would be cheesy and cheap, I was wrong. The only think that disappointed me was the fact that it had no extra features on it, other than scene selection."
4,Jennifer Hammon Does It For Me,"Jennifer Hammon carries this film. The plot is hokey and the gratuitious lesbian sex scene was not very convincing. Putting that aside this Jennifer Hammon is one beautiful and clever actress. I am keeping this one in the DVD collection,"
3,Erotic and interesting movie,"Erotic and somewhat predictable plot to the movie. It doesn't hide that it comes from Eros pictures, a subsidiary of Playboy. There is a lot of high quality eroticism. The two main female characters are very pretty, where one is actually a veteran of soap operas and the other a erotic series on Cinemax."
4,So was I!,"This is a moderate soft-core film made better by the stunningly beautiful leading actress (in an innocent farm-girl kind-of way).There is a reasonable plot here too as youg farm girl goes to the city to be an artist and meets with an interesting dominatrix neighbour, and a murderer."
5,Deep in my heart,This is a wonderful movie for all of us who love operetta and especially the music of Sigmnd Romberg. A rare performance of Gene Kelly with his brother is also featured.
3,Great dancing,"The only thing good about the movie is the dancing. Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, and Ann Miller. They are 3 of the best dancers and you won't see anything like this again."
2,Depp In My Heart,"Sound - using both the Phillips DVD player - DVDR3360H and LG DVD player DR7922W were between one third and one half compared to other commercial DVD's. Constant humming probably due to 50HZ pick with the high audio setting required.Picture - was faultless on LG recorder. However, when played on the Phillips recorder, there were many sporadic breaks of typically 3 - 8 seconds of darkened screen and sound loss.May well be incapability problem, as no such effects have been found with other commercial DVD's. If so, this should have been advised on purchase."
4,a founding father of the defense industry,"this is the autobiography of Bill Burden, who began life among the wealthy of Newport, went to Harvard in 1923, and, after many high positions in the financial and defense industries, convinced President Nixon to build the Air and Space Museum. The Peggy of the title was his wife, Peggy Partridge. A fascinating book for those interested in America's true aristocracy. Full of little surprises, such as his friendship with Noel Coward. 348 pages, photos.Foreword by General Maxwell Taylor."
5,Superb,Sounds like a full orchestra thanks to great arrangements.Better liner notes should have been provided. Gershwin lives on. Nuff said
5,GEORGE AND IRA GERSHWIN.,WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THE GERSHWIN BROTHER'S MUSIC. I LOVE EVERYTHING THEY EVER WROTE AND AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS IN MY LARGE COLLECTION.
3,An adagio homage...,"Listening to this recording reminds me of a stunning molasses sculpture. If there is such a thing, it would be artwork that is too sweet and lugubrious to be great art.The three familiar arias by Cilea, Puccini, and Verdi, can be heard in more urgent readings by any number of spintos from past decades. (Think Price, Scotto, Freni, Tebaldi.) It's nice, but not essential, to hear these warhorses sung by Fleming.The remaining arias are new to me. Hearing rarely performed arias sung by Ms. Fleming is worth the price of this disk. But, did she have to pick arias that, for the most part, are somber, dreary, and morose? Weren't some of the divas cited in the liner notes capable of joy, humor, or at least an ""up"" tempo?I must agree with another reviewer, Dean Rishel, that Renee Fleming has a great voice. But why does she seem to communicate ""...see what a great voice I have?"" For whom is she singing? With all of these dirges, is she singing for a dead relative/relationship?"
2,Renee! Pick up the pace girl!,"Maria Callas said as a soprano you should be able to sing everything. People may not like the interpretation but musicality should never waver. Well, Renee! Your tempi are so slow that I lost interest in most of this CD. Still love you. I cannot recommend this CD."
3,Guide to teaching Brass,"The book is too expensive, perhaps it is because of the use of some shinny papers to boost up the cost.I find it very disorganized in how it presents the material."
1,Nothing great about it !,The books talk more about BPM high level overview and some basics fundamentals. Also I observed that it focuses more towards vendor selection and tool side. I found it is very common info. Also the approach from the title itself is very confusing
5,Harry does it again,"I loved Harry's first book, and this one is even better. While I don't agree with all the advice, he certainly nails the decision points and helps you make any marketing or sales more effective."
3,OK Book but not up to Beckwith's standards,"Don't et me wrong, this is a good book, and if you have time I would recommend reading it. It's just not one of the best and not as good as the first two books from Harry Beckwith.The format is great: compact, easy to read, perfect to bring on a 2-3 hour flight. The book is a collection of ideas and stories, which makes it also a good book for people who prefer to read a few pages per day. The stories are not very connected on a single theme:the book is about much more than ""What clients love"" .Some of the ideas in the book are old, some are OK, some I don't agree with, and a few were really good. This is one of those books that can give you one really good idea that makes reading the book 10x worth it. Yet I didn't get any - you might. Good luck"
4,What Clients Love,"The book is almost as good as Harry Beckwirth's first book, Selling the Invisible. It's certainly a book that I intend to keep, and refer to from time to time."
5,"When the blue of the night, meets the laser of your CD....","I have always been a casual Bing fan so I borrowed this from a friend just to listen to. I had a fear of many ""cheezy"" and drab tunes. But I was surprised.WOW! What a phenominal collection. Besides many of Bing's biggest hits, there are also a number of rareities and obscurities. Just about every song on all 4 CD's are a treat.Highlights include singing with Bob Hope on THE ROAD TO MORROCO, Bing sings Christmas tunes, a few tunes from the flick HOILDAY INN, many cool standards!!There are a number of his early tunes on the 1st CD that are worth the price of admission. Only complaint - where is I SURRENDER DEAR?You can't go wrong here. This is THE Bing collection."
3,handle too large,I don't like this as well as my other canes. The foam handle is too large (and I have large hands). In the summer it's warm/
5,"Crash, bang, clankity clang","This is a sort of ""Best Thomas Trainwrecks"" collection. It is a series of five minute stories, each involving trains that derail, crash into one another, drive into water or get covered by dirt. It is great fun. My two year old, who is a Thomas addict, loves this video and just laughs with glee with every wreck.Alec Baldwin's narration is excellent. This is a must have video for your Thomas collection!"
2,too scary!,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves Thomas, so I was excited to buy him this DVD. However, this collection includes episodes about mudslides, floods, and something about being trapped in a mine. The first (and only) time he watched it, he kept running out of the room to hide in another room. What a disappointment. I don't know why the creators of shows for small children think they have to make things scary. What a waste."
5,An up-close and personal look at domestic violence,"Scared To Leave, Afraid To Stay is a book that shows what it is like for a woman to leave the man that is abusing her. While there are many good domestic violence books, none combine an understanding of domestic violence with knowledge of the law like this book does. I found myself caring about the women described in the book and wishing all women could have an attorney as caring as the author. This book will be popular with domestic violence victims and their advocates. I only hope some judges read it also."
5,Works well,"I used this to flush out the grey and black water tanks prior to winterizing. Two to three tries were needed to clean out all the residual scum or deposits. It also restored the level sensing that had become stuck. Bottom line, it works well."
3,I'm Sure The Original Valterra Is Better,"This thing is okay. The ""switch"" to go between hose and tank is fairly pointless and in fact, it has such a small hole that it reduces the flow somewhat from the Flush King. It is a straight connector unlike the Flush King that comes out at 45 degrees. Lucky for me I already had a 45 degree flush, but it doesn't have a valve so that's why I bought this. It works, but the fit wasn't great. The more I had to twist the hose/tank switch and push/pull the valve, the more that the thing tried to come off my trailer. It would start sliding off and leaking on the ground a little. As long as I kept a good eye on it I could keep it from doing that. The Flush King is more expensive but I think if I had my choice to do it all over I would buy the original and I would buy it online from Tweetys not camping world. I tried searching for it on Amazon but this product was where I ended up. I don't think Amazon or anyone on Amazon sells it I guess."
3,leaks,THe unit I got worked and allowed me to flush my tanks but the hose/off valve leaks just a little especially if you try to change the setting with the hose pressurized also if for any reason you bump or turn the valve while dumping.
4,Not used,I bought this to use on my fifth wheel and stored it in the camper without installing it. Who knows why? It looks to be well made as it is designed.
5,RV Holding Tank Rinser,This item is fantastic. After the first week with our new travel trailerwe found none of the three holding tank level indicators registeredcorrectly after dumping. The dual flush pro arrived from Amazon.com acouple days before they said it would. After several flushes in the blacktank and one each for the grey tanks every thing was back to normal. Icouldn't be more satisfied!
2,"leaks around sewage connection, no o-ring. flush valve small and takes along time to backflush tanks.","leaks around sewage connection, no o-ring.flush valve small and takes a long time to refill tanks. does the job if you have time and patience. would search for different product next time for the price of this one."
5,Great Product!,This was the best investment for our Travel Trailer. Using this helped minimize the smell you get using at camper bathroom. Plus it helped with the indicator reading correctly on the levels withing the tanks. I would recommend if you don't have a built in backflushing systems.
1,Poor quality product,I ordered two of these valves at seperate times and they were both broken. It is a very poor design and it should not be onthe market. The place were you attach the fresh water hose is not strong enough to support the weight of the hose with out breaking off the coupling.
2,"Arrived broken, twice.",I guess I should take the hint and move on to another product. Amazon cancelled my 3rd order and refunded my $. Both units arrived with a crack in the base of the connector for the hose. Water would have sprayed everywhere when I hooked them up (I didn't). Both were packaged well enough that I don't think shipping caused the damage (the boxes were not beat up or anything). Seems like it would work if I could get one that isn't defective.
4,My Hubby loves this thing!,"Okay so I am not an expert on Tank Flushing, however my Hubby wanted one, He says it makes it easier to flush the tanks."
2,Get the chicco C5,"I bought this stroller 2 months ago and have not been very happy with it.First of all, when I am pushing the stroller I kick the wheels, which is beyond annoying, and I am only 5'3"". My husband can't stand behind it at all and push, he has to stand to the side. And don't even try to do any one handed pushing or turning, it's impossible.Also, my baby is only 20 lbs. right now, under the 35 lb. weight limit for the stroller, and when I push and turn the stroller it seems very flimsy almost ""bendy"" to me, which really makes it hard to steer and maneuver. I can't imagine how ""bendy"" it will be when he gains weight. Well, I'll never know because I am returning this one today to BRU and getting the Chicco C5.The only good reason I can think of to have this stroller is the fact that it is so light. If you travel alot and need a stroller that is easy to carry and is pretty cheap, this would be it."
1,Unworthy of the O' Malley Legacy,"I felt that Darling Jasmine was just a very bad book all around--despicable characters, frenzied plot twists, faulty editing, weak dialogue, and on and on. This was an unpleasant surprise for me. I have read the entire O'Malley Saga; Darling Jasmine brings Skye O'Malley's life of adventure to a fitting close. However, Darling Jasmine is nothing like the other O'Malley books and belongs in a place all to itself--the trash can."
2,Mediocrity At Its Worst,"I must admit that I have read every Bertrice Small novel. Some I have read many times. Yet, with each new novel Ms. Small becomes less concerned with the plot, setting, and characterization and more obsessed with extroardinarily graphic sex. Darling Jasmine is no exception. I hope that in the futore Bertrice Small returns to her roots and doles out novels the likes of the Kadin, which focus on the entire lifestyles of the characters as opposed to the time they spend in the bedroom."
1,Worst of all Small's books,"I disliked ""Wild Jasmine"" greatly as I felt it was nothing more than a compilation of several elements of her other books. I found the sequel to be nothing more than a plug for the rest of the O'Malley saga. It was overly graphic, even for Ms. Small and completely unromantic. At best it was a simple attempt to continue to milk fans of the O'Malley saga."
1,...since there was no selection for zero stars,"I did not even finish this book. I read Hellion and enjoyed her writing style, but I believe that is the end of my purchases of Beatrice Small books. In a word... Boring."
1,Didn't make it past page 100,"I haven't read any other of Ms. Small's ""Skye O'Malley"" series, so that may have something to do with my feelings. I found ""Darling Jasmine"" boring and pathetic, full of cliched characters and positions."
4,A Good Read,"Although she is no Skye O'Malley, Jasmine is her own person and commands excitement nonetheless. This sequel to Wild Jasmine was predictable, yet exciting. Bertrice Small writes with such lush detail and vivid characters that I feel as if I am a participant. I enjoyed this book. (Some parts better than others.) Someone who picks it up before reading the other Skye O'Malley books, might get a little lost. Those who have read the series must remember that Jasmine is not Skye, and enjoy this character for who she is."
4,I liked this one.,"One of the better ones for me in this series. If you like her books, you will like this one and I say that because some are not good or worth the money and some are a great read."
2,Oh Dear,"In absolute terms, this book is still worth reading (which is why it's getting two stars.) Small's worst pretty stacks up to everyone else's best. That being said, it's sad to read this and remember her masterworks (mistressworks?) such as Skye O'Malley, Kadin, and Beloved. At her best, Small had written books that were genuinely literary. With Darling Jasmine, and the last several in general, she gives the impression of simply going through the motions."
5,Welcome Back!,"Petsmart stop carrying these bones. Thought I was sunk. Now my 3 dogs will entertainthemselves for hours and I can get some peace. Not quiet, but I won't complain. Thebones will last for months. Hot Damn!!!"
3,Jack Russel destroyed this,"My dog loves to chew. A dear antler usually last her 3 weeks, but they are pretty pricy. After reading peoples reviews on how their big dogs would chew on this for months, I decided to give it a try. Well after 20 minutes my Jack Russel tore a half inch chunk off of the bone. Had to grab it out of her mouth because I was afraid she would choke on it. I'm not sure if i have a super dog, but I was expecting something a little tougher."
1,Purpose and Process,I though this book would help me with my writing class....IT did notInstead I read other people's writing and got no help
5,"Humorous, Witty, Clever!","This is one of my favorite Nero Wolfe novels. I think my mouth may have fallen open in surprise as I read it. Not only does Nero Wolfe leave his secure brownstone (to attend an orchid show), but -- horrors! -- Archie drives their car into a tree. They seek help from a nearby farm, but in crossing the pasture to get to the farmhouse, they're charged by a bull. Caesar by name, $45,000 of beef on the hoof. The scene in which Wolfe scrambles to safety atop a rock is hilarious.As it turns out, the bull is owned by Thomas Pratt, who intends to slaughter and barbecue Ceaser in order to publicize his (Pratt's) chain of restaurants. This publicly declared announcement by Pratt sets off a series of murders, the first of which is attributed to . . . Caesar. A great read. Highly recommended!"
5,Confusing Bonus content with book,"I don't like most of the ""Wolfe out of the office"" stories but this is one of the best. It's also the debut Lily Rowan story and establishes why she acts the way she does with Archie in subsequent stories.The confusing bonus content is that the book also comes with ""The Golden Spiders"". Not a preview, but the entire novel. It's also a bit confusing to get two novels for less than the price of ""Too Many Cooks"". Clearly the people who own the Kindle editions need to get together on this."
2,Hip hop ejay 6 what a waist of time,"ONLY 8 Bars to record at a time, man that's lame. What's with all the complicated screens, it should supply its own computer geek with the software. Ejay 4 was much better! I would have enjoyed it more if it were a little easier to use and understand. Don't waist your time!"
2,this isnt the best ejay,"this product runs the slowest out of all of them. I tried to run it on my laptop but it would just lag to much. so then I decided to run it on my newest computer, just got it in 2006 and it is designed for gaming but it was still to slow. The software is to advanced for what you are really here for. It focuses on to many things other than making music. Although it is a little more advanced than the other ones but the beatz are kinda soft. They could have made it a little harder. But over all i recamend hip hop ejay 5. Probably the most advanced but simplest to use and good sound quality out of all of them."
4,Great...but why not for Mac??,"I've had the past 5 versions of this but have recently switched to a Macintosh and am completely unable to run any of the past 5 versions or this new one. Why? Make a Mac version, bottom line."
2,Dont Believe the Hype,"All the other reviews must have been written by the published or author because this book was definitely not 4.5 stars. The content is good, but if you are trying to learn access it is pretty confusing and annoying to use as a reference. Not enough examples and too many wordy descriptions which become confusing and annoying to decipher. Not to mention my book came missing about 50 pages."
4,This was very useful,This book has many samples to work from. It is very useful tool for someone to use to pull informtion out of a database.
3,Microsoft forms access,Product is OK Not what I expected. I thought it was a full program of Access.
2,Needs meat!,"If you are a beginner then there is some value. Any higher skill level then you will find that the book lacks meat - nothing new or exciting or creative to forms, reports or queries that you could not get out of some dummy book. No cd to practice with and some of the examples are unclear."
5,Fantastic reference for busy business analyst,"This book is well organized and makes referencing functions, concepts and procedures easy for the busy working analyst. The book covers all the ""little things"" that makes Access the quicky but useful business tool. Excellent ""on the go"" reference, I didn't sit down to read this cover to cover but have managed to read most of the book just by looking up the one or two concepts I need at the moment. Excellent for office use!"
2,Disappointing purchase!,"I'm not a red Sox fan but I am a baseball fan and after purchasing this book I can safely say I was truly disappointed. A respected newspaper like the Boston Globe should turn out a fine publication of it's hometown baseball team conquering the Baseball World in the most dramatic fashion but it fails badly. You can't overlook the grievous statistical errors that appear at various times within the box and line scores. I also have an issue with the choice of pictures, there are very little photos of actual hitting, pitching and fielding, mostly they are of guys celebrating. The reader is left wondering if they ever played games on the field. Not enough actual baseball action photos to detail Boston's great season. A very poor effort and had i known the book would be this disappointing I obviously would have avoided buying it."
2,Errorful,"I wonder if anyone tried to edit this book. You would think that after 86 years of no championships, this book would be flawless. O well, at least the Boston Globe tried and I'm sure the ring is more important than a book to Red Sox fans."
1,Highly disappointing effort,"[...] This book was highly disappointing to me as a huge Sox fan for a number of reasons. In an effort to produce something quickly, the Globe sportswriters wrote some of their worst articles ever. Look no further than inside the front cover, where it says that a statue will be erected to Pedro Martinez, among others. After Pedro bolted for the Mets and trashed the team, that seems highly unlikely. Perhaps if the Globe let some time pass by before writing this trash, they could have placed the championship in a better perspective. For now, however, I am glad that I borrowed a copy instead of paying for one."
2,Crying Shame!,"Yes, the book is full of errors. They are altering history! It's obvious the book was rushed.Here are some other error facts:1) The errors seem to be inconsistent. It's almost like they tried to fix them and created others!2) The box score errors are the saddest part of the book. When you look at the box scores to see how the Sox beat the Yanks so dramatically and the runs don't even add up in the total column...sigh...3) In my book, the Pedro Martinez tribute story starts on page 116 and re-starts on page 118 (of course these page ""numbers"" might not match with yours).Bad edit decisions exist too. Put the World series first, then the ALCS, the ALDS, and then the regular season??? So, I read it backwards.The pictures are nice. I love the ALCS Game 3 spectator shot (p. 47)--it sums up the feelings I had at that time. Is it worth $25? How big of a fan are you? I'd still by it again, but it's a huge disappointment. What a paradox!"
4,What great Concert!,"If you Love Greg's Studio Albums but have never seen him Live you Have to check this out. I sat down with my old friend the other day and threw this album on he had never heard of Greg Before but instantly loved it. Grab this album sit down with a bottle of good Whiskey and set the mood, and Greg Will do the rest."
4,Very cool--though pricey,"These fit my head perfectly and the earbuds inserted into my ears better than any earbuds I own. Not bad as sunglasses, though not my personal style. Perhaps they can do these in the C-Frame someday...I think 256Meg is the absolute minimum in today's MP3 world and the price difference between 128 and 256 isn't too much of a curve. Overall, if you want to have the coolest toy on the block, these babies are it...for now."
4,Gift,I purchased this item for someone that does not live here. I haven't seen it but they are satisfied with it.
5,Smart investment,"I used to worry about power surges and voltage spikes, but no more. I have a background in electronics, so I am very familiar with what happens when some motor kicks on.I've had one of these units for 5 or 6 years now and there have been zero problems. This unit stops all problems. (Didn't help my neighbors though). There is one caution: keep an eye on those led's. These units tell you if there is a problem, which is why we bought them in the first place."
4,advertising murder-for-hire [no spoilers],"""The Soldier of Fortune Murders"" largely follows four people, including their family background, as related to three murders in the 1980's. Sandra Black, mother and wife, is the unfortunate victim in a gruesome assassination for greed and lust. The remaining three, her husband Bob Black, John Wayne Hearn, and the object of John's desires Debbie Bannister, lie, cheat, and murder to get what they want.The ruthless Debbie Bannister is faultlessly portrayed as the mastermind behind the cold-blooded schemes while Hearn receives a mixture of desperation and despair. The author not only includes the family history addressing psychological behaviors but also covers local history of Texas and especially Texas A&M.; Unfortunately the chronological order becomes confusing when it jumps around particularly within individual storylines. Still the information is quite thorough, ending maybe near the middle of 1991.Thank you."
1,Pathetic,"A privileged boy's aggrandized account of his relatively uneventful days during the tail-end of the Vietnam war, penned (with uncredited help) for a politically driven purpose. An affront to those who served under heavy fire in face-to-face combat. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this."
5,Important read.,"Seashore6, your post was absolutely uncalled for and untrue. I watched this book being written with absolutely NO help. It was also absolutely not written for political reasons. In fact, the book was written initially just after the author left the war as an account for personal reasons. On top of it, how dare you disrespect one of our nations veterans? utterly shameful."
3,"""Tell it like it is"" cut in the middle","There are some very good songs on this CD like the original version of ""Mother in Law"" by Ernie K. Doe and of course all the Fats Domino tracks ; but it is frustrating to get the song ""Tell it like it is"" cut in the middle of a verse, at only 2'24."
5,Great Item,"I bought this item for my son's shuffle that he inherited from a friend. It's brand new and came in a box. I received the item quickly with no problem. My son love's this clip, sinc eit came with a key ring. I would definitely recommend this item anytime and supplier. Thank you!"
3,"Not bad,but...","It is much better than most of his works in the 80-ies and 90-ies,but I would strongly recommend ""Kontinuum""(2007)instead,especially for those who loved ""Timewind"",""Moondawn"",""Body Love"" and ""Mirage"".Though ""Moonlake"" has its fine moments(""Same thoughts Lion"",""Mephisto""),but the longest first track(""Playmate in Paradise"" - 30:07 min.)with its boring New Age ethnic vocalization spoils,unfortunatelly, the whole work.Anyway,recommended for at least two really good tracks at the end."
3,So close...,"This is Schulze's best release in years - not counting his collaborations with Pete Namlook. I just wish that there weren't the awful vocallizations in the first track (it would have been the best track). Overall it's a consistent effort. Unlike Edgar Froese, Klaus still has the creative spirit and energy of his younger days."
5,The greatest BB 2 cd hit collection ever put together WORD!,"First of all, Bobby Blue Bland is without a doubt the most gifted singer of his generation in the Blues/RB field, and when united with the writers, musicians and arrangements of the Duke team, it was a marriage blessed to create songs that will nevergrow old,cold or fail to warm your heart deep in your soul. This collection is without dispute the very best of those happily married years. It a shame they didn't have more kids/songs to keep them coming back together, cuzz when they were together they couldn't be beat and were as hot as the funk brothers in motown. Hope someone takes a hint and tells their story, WORD!Yours truly, OldSchoolMaster1,Daniel M. Ellis."
5,I was lucky enough to stumble across this.....,"If you are the type of person who heard Otis Redding for the first time, and fell in love with his voice only later falling in love the music all together then this is an album you must have. Bobby ""Blue"" Bland has an extremely soulful unique voice that can massage the stress right out of your soul. You will think to yourself how did I miss this, and then you will realize your life will never be the same now that you found it."
3,Japanese Art Schooling,"Handsome ambitious art students struggle to meet ends as entering a circle of friends 19-year-old female co-student disrupted them from arrangements.This lyric drama is of ""maybe watch"" value to a reviewer."
3,It is OK but not that great,"The actors were fine but it was obvious that the story lacked big chunks. Don't get this unless you know the manga or the TV series (I haven't read or seen either) or care for any of the actors.It is not bad per se, just a bit bland."
2,eh. not the best but...,i watched the entire series online and wasn't that crazy about it. Huge fan of Ikuta Toma but his character was dull in this drama. Also it wasn't exciting at all for me. Anyways i don't think its worth buying but you can always watch it on mysoju.com along with many more asian dramas
3,Not Bad,"Mostly comprised of recent remakes of the originals which somehow lack the excitement of their heyday, this 3 disc set nevertheless churns out some listenable (mostly surf) instrumentals."
3,Wasn't as describe :(,I was angry when the book arrived. It had said that it ncluded the CD-rom with the book and it did not.
4,Guru Guru - 'Dance Of The Flames' (Inside Out),"Originally released in 1974, this was Guru Guru's seventh album, counting compilations. Even though ace krautrocker guitarist Ax Genrich had already jumped ship and was replaced by Houschang Nejadepour (former Eiliff member), I felt that 'Dance Of The Flames' was a worth while effort. Maybe more progressive than past Guru Guru efforts but still likely to hold most fan's interest. Reason I'm even giving this CD reissue a four-star rating is mostly for effort, I guess. Most happening cuts here are the adventurous ""Dagobert Duck's 100th Birthday"", ""Girl From Hirschhorn"", the wailing title track ""Dance Of The Flames"" and even thought I'm usually bored with most tunes as such,the jazzy ""God's Endless Love For Man"". Was pleasantly surprised by this disc. Line-up: Mani Neumeier-drums & keyboards, Houschang Nejadepour - guitar and Hans Hartman - bass. Nice."
5,A Haunting Book,"There's a Macbeth-like feel to these indelible sepia-toned images. Many of Clay's pictures bring to mind the words ""blasted heath"" and echo the Shakespearean turns of phrase in the lyrics of Robert Johnson. And oh, those wonderful dogs!..."
3,Thought these were the big ones,Unfortunately I thought these were the jumbo blocks so needless to say I was a little dissapointed... Although my son seems to like them but doesn't love them as much as the big ones...
2,Bloody boring. Like an unending nightmare.,"I don't know if the Taxmen were after Heyer when she wrote this, but this is simply boring tales of a wive who spends too much money and digs in deeper as she refuses to tell her loving husband. Compounded by a brother who borrows for his gambling, these are all unlikeable characters."
4,a good read,"Although not the absolute best Heyer novel, this one is still worth reading. I actually rate it one of my favorites If you enjoy Heyer's other regency novels, you might give this a try as well."
3,One of Heyer's few Regency's that doesn't work,"April Lady is a frustrating book. Instead of worrying about extravagence Lord Cardross should be worrying that his children will be half-witted like his wife and brother-in-law or willfull and selfish like his sister. Nell is not only naive, she's also stupid, and her brother Dysart is just an idiot. At least Dysart's friend Corny is a lovable idiot. And Cardross's sister is a piece of work. I feel very sorry for Mr. Allandale. I was cringing through much of the narrative. Only the last few scenes sparkled with Heyer's usual wittiness and saved the book from 2 stars. I'll add this to Regency Buck and Sprig Muslin as Heyer books that just aren't up to her usual standard."
4,an education the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst couldn't give,The blundering of a badly run military campaign in well documented form.Why the British Empire actually failed?For me it was an education the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst couldn't give.
2,Buyer Beware...,"Be prepared to be slightly disappointed with the quality of the images on this video. As an addition to one's judo video library, and as an historical record of Mifune-sensei in action, this is probably worth having if for no other reason than to have the opportunity to see Mifune move. However, I again caution you that the quality of the old B&W footage is poor at best. In addition, my copy took 6 or 7 weeks to arrive it was advertised as being readily available. So, buyer beware."
1,All Judoka must see this material,"I first saw this material 40 years ago on 16mm film. Among the judoka I know, it's known as the ""pruning the cherry tree"" film. It's wonderful footage and so it's a real shame that the DVD will not play reliably. The first time I played it, it seemed to ""stutter"" a number of times during the 2 hrs. The second time several weeks later it wouldn't play more than a few seconds! I bought the Jigoro Kano DVD at the same time and it has the same problem. They are both produced by the same company and I suspect the disks physical specs. are borderline. these are the only DVDs in my collection with this problem."
5,Kodokan Judo with Kyuzo Mifune,"This DVD contains footage the last 10th dan ever. The footage is about 2 hours long and all of this footage is of Mifune himself, he is seen taking a class, of adults and children, demonstrating all the major throws (gokyo). Mifune himself performing Kata which include the Shinken Shobu no Kata (Kime no Kata), the Itsitsu no Kata (Five Forms) and the Kodokan Goshin Jutsu. Mifune is also seen supervising students performing the Nage no Kata, he then takes part in a randori session with students of about 4th dan and above. This DVD is in my opinion a must for any serious Judoka, the footage is in black and white throughout with a slightly out of synch commentary, but this in no way detracts from the high quality content. A definite must have for any serious Judo collector or enthusiast."
5,"Very aesthetic, easy installation","It is cheap, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. If you have small speakers, it is definitely a great option."
1,A very bad book,"This is one of the worst textbooks I have ever used. Luckily, we only used to for one week...I couldn't imagine having to use it for any longer than that. Unfortunately there isn't an option for zero stars."
4,Helpful,"I'm using this book to study for a DSST test, and so far it has been a great resource. My favorite part is the summary at the end of each chapter."
2,"basic information, nothing very deep","I bought this book after using Outlook98 for approximately one week. During that week, I was self tought, and purchased the book because I was looking for something that could give me more than I could teach myself. What I found was disappointing. The book is essentially a walk through of the simple features of Outlook. It provides a basic overview, but lacks the depth in any one subject that I hoped to find."
4,Good for a real Dummy,"I bought this book for a client who uses Outlook for email. I've ready quite a bit of it myself and so far, everything we've needed to figure out has been covered in the book.I don't personally use Outlook, however (I use Eudora). I did find it a little lacking in ""security"" issues, but it is a ""beginner's"" book, after all."
1,Dangerous,Addded air and got 3 short blasts. Added more air and can exploded. There is no way to tell how much air is in canister.
3,"Works, but ...","Bought this to try to mitigate the neighbor dog's incessant barking. A few blasts and the dog shuts up, for a while anyway. The product is pretty much as advertised, with one exception: the can says max pressure is 150psi. Don't believe it. After charging many times to 120-130psi, my compressor reservoir was showing 140 and I tried to fill the horn. The bottom buckled out and popped the plastic base off (which was only attached with hot glue). Also, this is about $3 worth of materials--so it's grossly overpriced--but I'll probably buy another because it does what I need done and it's refillable and so more eco-friendly."
5,"Loud, reuseable",Not much to say here. Very useful and environmentally friendly! Just hook up to pressurized air and refill. Works great!
2,Not enough capacity,I bought this product at a local marine store and I am very disappointed at the very small amount of blasts you can actually get from one charge. I use air horns on my sail boat as a safety device and I would basically need to have a compressor handy to be absolutely sure that I will be able to use the horn. I might as well buy a real horn with a compressor or stick to the air cans that I have used in the past.Also beware that the product is slightly bigger than the usual air horns.One additional drawback is the fact that you don't know how much compressed air is left in the can.I like and support the move to Eco friendly products but I feel that products like this one are so inferior to their non-Eco counter parts that they are doing a disservice to the cause.I would have returned the product but the packaging was already gone.
2,Dull and boring.,"This soundtrack isn't really up to much at all I'm afraid. The are only 10 tracks and most them are tedious songs that no one cares about. A real disappointment, much like the film.The depth and reason behind much of the songs chosen for the film are very uninspired. It could have been a lot better, especially when you consider how well the album to the first movie sold. Tho this time the movie didn't have the expertise and scutiny of Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. The result is a flat and uninteresting soundtrack CD.Nile Rogers even replaced the now MIA Harold Faltermeyer. His music in the movie was of a completely tone but it is still better than anything this CD has to offer. The Axel F tune is the only worthy track left. But EVERYBODY knows how it goes by now so it's hardly worth shelling out the money for."
1,"PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE, DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!",This movie has a running time of only a few minutes. Purchased this for my Kindle Fire and had to call customer service for a refund.
1,Can only view first two minutes,Paid $3.99 to watch something that I can only watch a minute and 56 seconds of. Not sure why the entire film is not available.
5,the best bag for your budget,"The bag looks nice with the meinl name on front. Fits the timbales really good a 14"" and 15"". Prevents them from scratching and taking good care of the timbales. You also have a separate room for the stand and some sticks. Although there's no room for the cowbells, this bag is amazing. The only down side is that is pretty heavy to carry them around but that's understandable. Overall for the price I'm really happy with the bag."
2,hunting game,I didnt care for the game play. Most of the Cabela games play the same and its just a personal prefernce.
4,ARGGGHHH! Oh the frustration!,"Love the camera! Hate the dang Power button. Whoever designed this stupid, itty-bitty, tiny, button should be smacked in the face. Other than that this camera works beautifully! It's great for those candids of my 1 year old daughter! Just beware of trying to turn it on with fat fingers!"
1,Think twice before u buy this peice:,"Guys wait for some time. They are playing mind games with this piece. They started displaying it with 65% off - for $104.58.(July 20th)Now the display is with 27% off - for $219.95.(July 27th)The silliest part is the same seller is also displaying the item in an ""In stock soon"" order with 17% off - for $249.94.I have gone through its user-manual. The product looks cool on paper. But this gross play is making this product stink."
1,they must be joking,"I bought the camera for advertised $104 price and they have cancelled my order without notifying me at all. That's not all, i also bought a SD Memory Card to use with the camera and they have already delivered it. Now i have a SD Card with no camera :). I really need a digital camera but i don't know if i can trust them again. From now on, how could i know if their advertised prices are real?"
5,Great,"This book is amazing. An all Time American Classic. The follow up to ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" follows his best friend Huckleberry and a black slave named Jim as they journey to free Jim. I give this 2 thumbs WAAAAAAAy UP. A must read"
3,Not exactly round,"The trimmer string was supposed to be round, it has edges that make it hard to put on the spool."
1,Misleading pictures and description,"I just received this and to my surprise, what was shipped is not what is adverstised here. I did get Force 4 .065 trimmer line but I received a ROLL, not a spool, of 540 feet (not that I measured it, it says so right on the package).I have been shopping with Amazon for a long time and this is the first time I was totally disappointed in what I received from them.Too bad. I guess it's true, buyer beware...."
2,Don't bother,"This is apparently written for first year college students. I'm a journalist and this book popped up somewhere on a list of books that are useful to learn good writing from. I didn't find it particularly useful. A lot of examples of facile student writing. A lot of scenarios dredged from classrooms. A lot of common sense and minute dissection of words and sentences and so on and so on. The best book I've ever found on writing is Thomas and Turner's 'Writing Classic Prose.' This book can't hold a candle to it. It did have some interesting parts though, and the references to James Thurber made me look up his biography of Harold Ross, which I ordered, and which looks magnificent."
1,great film not so the dvd,"this is my favorite western and i have been after it for so long and i went and bought this dvd which i was disappointed with, it is not the official dvd, the quality is poor and blurry. this film needs to be restored and released by columbia because the film is a top notch western, for me it is better than not having it at all, because it is not often seen on t.v and i love glenn ford, by the way i rate the film 5 out of 5 and just 1 for the quality of the dvd"
4,The Sheepman,Although a little expensive the product is quite ok. It was a little unfortunate that our dollar crashed somewhat just prior to the purchase.Would reccomend it to any Glenn Ford fans.
5,The Sheepman DVD,"The only problem I had was that it took so long to get delivered that I thought it was lost in the mail. I contacted the company and they mailed out another copy. In the mean time, the original mailing arrived so I returned the second DVD to them."
5,Great Underrated Western Finally on DVD,"Hooray for someone finally putting this one out on DVD. I've searched for it for years, ever hopeful. Together with The Cowboy and The Rounders, it's one of the best vehicles by Ford. Of course there are others, like 3:10 to Yuma, but these three have been long neglected in presentations of his best works. Perhaps Ford's death last year prompted release. Whatever the reason, I'm very glad."
5,The Sheepman,"Excellent. Very good quality picture. I will be purchasing more items in the future, if this is the standard. Took longer than I expected to receive the DVD but all is well."
4,"Good, old fashioned western with a twist!","A cattleman wins sheep and has to find some way to deal with it.The extra characters in this film really make it fun to watch, from Edgar Buchanan to Mickey Schaugnessy.Classic range war theme but the good guy, who maybe isn't all that good, wins in the end.Too bad there was no digital remastering done to this film. It's a straight from the film copy and could be enhanced with newer technology.But if you like western's it's a must for your collection."
4,Funk Music/Back in the Day!,"""Back in the Day when I was YOUNG ,I'm not a KID anymore but somedays I sit and WISH I was a kid AGAIN....""This album holds a song from my youth that I searched for for decades...... You will definately go back and know these musics is when MUSIC was REAL. Red Light basement Str8 funky...You are gonna love it..get both CDS and have an Old school party for you ,your family and friends....... Betcha by golla WOW!"
3,Interesting Read,"We enjoy it. I just thought from the cover that it would be more ""tarantula"" looking. It is a ""see through body"" We love the details in the articles. Alot of fun information! We like looking at the ""inside"" of the tarantula."
5,A party game,"Kung Fu Chaos is really a party game, that is, you should play it with friends. Solo play is novel and fun for about 2-3 hours, but it wears off pretty quick because you only have so many moves and the taunt system, which seems hilarious at first, doesn't have much lasting value. But with friends you can have a good time taunting each other, throwing each other off platforms, and enjoying the mini games together. The soundtrack is ok, and you can rip your own music to play with. The controls are also pretty simple to learn, so if you are a casual fighting gamer, you'll appreciate its simplicity, but if you are serious into fighting games, it's definitely too simple and bland."
5,Surprisingly Fun,"This game is so much fun.Just fighting to unlock levels and modes is a good time.I love the director and the characters in Kung Fu Chaos.If you want a Super Smash Brothers type game, get this.It's a lot of fun."
5,GREAT GAME,"This is a fun game, especially the 1-player mode. And it is 3-D. The controls are also easy to learn. This will entertain people for hours."
5,fun once you become ninja master,"at first i didnt really like it because i didnt know what was happening but once i did the training and learned all the moves i became extremely fun, it just needs one thing, a level where you can beat the director."
4,Plenty of BAD reviews but it was fun to play,"Not many good reviews of this game, but I don't think the reviews are being fair. OK. This game does have bad moments such as the multiplayer, but I think the single player mode is interesting and fun. For example, they have some mini games in between levels such as throwing the princess at other players to knock them down. Other mini games include catching as many stuntmens from the roof as possible while trying to avoid being hit by falling cows, tables, and chairs. There is some replay value because you need to complete some levels with 5 stars to unlock hidden levels or characters. If you don't believe me, just rent the game and find out for yourself."
2,2.6 Stars...,"This game is pretty silly. I mean its alright to rent to kill time or something, but other than that this is for the younger kids around ages 5 to 13, I'd say. Or if you have a bunch of family members in the house that are in to gaming its something you can all get into, but other than those reasons there is no reason to buy this game."
3,Good -- but the adhesive strips paint!,"These are good to use for small-to-medium-sized windows if you've taken old blinds or curtains down and are awaiting new ones. They're easy to trim and install, filter light well, provide privacy, and actually look nice. But watch out: the adhesive used at the top of the blind to glue it to the inside of the window frame took the paint (admittedly old paint) off that part of our window frame. Might be a good idea to play it safe and use tacks instead. And -- if you need the temporaries for more than a month -- or if you have a tall, door-sized window -- you might want to pay more for cheap screw-in blinds with strings that open and close them. The blinds are not long enough for door-sized windows."
1,Terrible!,"I bought these as temporary shades until I get some real ones installed.The installation was super fast, but the results were horrible.A few days later the pleads almost disappeared and the thing looked like a flat piece of paper. You can as well just get a large paper and cover your window, cause that's what the redi shades are after 2-3 days.Not worth the money."
3,Good cheap shade NOT 72 INCHES LONG,"BEWARE OF LENGTH!! I ordered these for two different size windows. One window is only 18 inches long and 32 inches wide so after trimming for width the shade works great. If it was only for this window I would have given 5 stars. The other window is the same width but is 60 inches long. The blinds are sold as being 72 inches long. They are only 72 inches long if you strech them until there is no pleate left in them. Even then they will not stay that length. As is they would not cover the 60 inch length of the window, leaving nearly 6-8 inches that was not covered."
4,Great temporary shades!,"We have three windows at the top of our 20-foot high cathedral ceiling that permits the Arizona sun to shine in on our TV screen making it impossible to view during most of the day. One of our maintenance men suggested these temporary blinds and offered to install them as he had the necessary extension ladder. What I like about these shades is that while blocking the Arizona sun, they allow the light to filter through. This is our second set of three blinds with the first set lasting almost 3 years before the Arizona sun and a lost hummingbird caused the shades to fall apart! They are simple to install, cut to size with a utility knife, and you can use hidden thumbtacks if you want additional reinforcement so they will stay put. Very happy with these blinds and highly recommend them for blocking out the bright sun but not the light and for their durability even though they are paper blinds."
2,Doesn't block that much light and the pleats pull out!!,"Unlike MANY of the reviewers on here, I am quite disappointed by my Redishades.... yes, they were super easy to install. I don't mind the little clips, either.But they certainly don't block too much light, and after two weeks, the pleats totally pulled out and it looks like I just hung a flat sheet of paper over my windows!!!!! I definately would not purchase again."
4,Enjoyed the broad range of life illustrated for this volume,"Wow - the enormous numbers of animal life is astounding and the book clearly shows this. Unfortunately the images are quite dark and the book is very thick (you get your money's worth - image-wise), so scanning them for use in various artistic media is difficult. Therefore, I bought two of the books and plan to cut one of them up (that hurts to say for I treasure books of all types). This way I can control the scanning and modification using software to bring out details and highlight an image to my satisfaction. And finally, the classic images are impressive and I applaud the author for his selection of animals from all realms of life on earth."
5,Black & White,"I loved this Book! I first saw it at the library and checked it out. But when I got it home and started looking at it, I knew I had to have it for my library. Great graphic drawings of animals in different poses."
2,Probably would not have purchased this had I seen it first,"There are tons of creatures in this book and interesting as it may be, many of the drawings are older and not to proper scale or perspective which is not going to be helpful if you are wanting them as a quick view for drawing or painting your own. Since I purchased it for that purpose I am disappointed. It is a nice book but not for what I was needing it for and if I had actually seen the book instead of purchasing online I would not have bought it at any price."
3,"Not all the songs , only 10 of the 16 advertised.","Beware of this album.The songs advertised are not all on the album. Also,some of the songs are recorded live at concerts and not the originals. But what is there is good, cant be mad at Bobby."
4,Marvelous....,"Ruthie Henshall has a very distinct voice that demands the attention of the listener. I wasn't sure what to expect from this album, but I was quite pleased. It's very laid-back. My only criticism is that there are no liner notes from Ms. Henshall explaining why she chose the songs she chose. The versions of Fleetwood Mac's Songbird and Madonna's Live to Tell rival the original versions. There were several songs that seemed very familiar to me, but I couldn't put my finger on where I'd heard them before. I recommend this album to any fan of so-called ""easy listening"" music or Broadway."
4,Soothing!!,"Ruthie never fails to have wonderful CD's or performances. This is one not as ""cabaret-like,"" but still has the soothing sounds of relaxation. This is a must!"
4,wow - that's a pricey cd,30 bucks? trust me - you can find it cheaper someplace like footlight records.
1,Big Disappointment,"Sea World Tycoon is one of the most frustrating simulation strategy games I have had the misfortune of purchasing. I rather enjoyed Zoo Tycoon and had hoped to find a similar happiness with Sea World Tycoon 2. Unfortunately, the ""tutorials"", and I use that term loosely, are worthless. The game also fails to come with any guide or instructions whatsoever. Several of the ""advertised"" features on the box were non-existent and/or impossible to locate or attempt to use. Not only does the game come with little help or guidelines, but there is also no online support or information out there. I recommend anyone interested in this game buy Zoo Tycoon with the Marine Mania expansion pack instead...without even having played that game, it's bound to be better then this one."
3,it's ok i guess,"this game is ok, except the fact that you can go down to being 1000 feet high! it is fun to train animals though, and to build the park, but i made a big park, with the best attractions, and i only had a 2 and half star rating; the same when i started. i would recomand something else."
3,"So So, Zoo Tycoon 2 is much better for the kids","My 5 year old daughter loves this game, but gets frustrated easily because you run out of money quick and have to manage things the right way to earn any money back. Zoo Tycoon 2 is much better, cause you can play with unlimited amounts of money."
5,THE SEA WORLD,"The following review is by Isabella (6 yr).""TONS OF DOLPHINS, SEA LIONS, POLAR BEARS, KILLER WHALES AND MORE 1000S OF OPTIONS AND CUTAWAY BUILDINGS AND BUILD THE SHAMU STADIUM,THIS IS A VERY NICE GAME TO PLAY. TAKE CARE OF THE DIFFERENT FISH. I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SEA WORLD SOME DAY""Parental comment: This particular 'animal' pc game is based on the San Diego 'Sea World' park. The purpose being to build and maintain you sea world zoo. And it dose take quite alot of planning and work to keep the various exhibits full, clean. active, and healthy. Not to mention the planning of events and layout of your fields of interaction. Helping young minds develop in planning and execution of projects. And making them aware of what it takes to run a zoo. Good crisp graphics. Good game for kids."
3,Damaged Goods,"The product it's self is what I expected, but it was badly damaged during shipping. I'm not happy at all with how the product was packed to be shipped. There was minimal padding, and a very thin box. If it were not so close to Christmas I would have sent it back for a new one. After reading other reviews, I probably will not use this seller again due to their lack of care in their shipping."
4,Great Price,I priced the same size/type board locally and was schocked to discover they were twice as much as this one.The board arrived when promised and packaged very well.I found it very easy to hang thanks to the enclosed instructions with a template and necessary hardware.One hint I would offer - you might want to use EXPO type markers exclusively because the other brand of markers were very hard to erase and I found it necessary to do a deep cleaning each time the kids earased the board.
1,Poor shipping,"I ordered this for the price--substantially less expensive for this dimension of white board than I've found elsewhere. The board itself appears very flimsy. It was bent and had a large puncture hole in it when I received it. However, the surface of the board appears like it will write well and if I can manage to get it delivered without a puncture hole in it, I can deal with the flimsiness. I've returned it and ordered another one."
1,badly damaged!,I just got it 10 minutes ago. It's badly damaged!!! I have to waste my time to call the company and have to waste more time to print out some lable and schedule with FEDEX to pick it up. Just feel totally waste my time and money.
4,Good Board,"This board is great for the price. It arrived in fine condition, was easy to mount, and markers erase nicely without leaving faint lines behind."
4,Great price for a good product,"This product matches the description well. The shipping was much faster than expected (ordered Saturday at noon and it arrived on Tuesday). Out of the box it was bent just a little toward the end of the board, but I was able to straighten it out and bend it back in place very easy.I would order this product again and possibly in bulk for several office rooms."
3,Not so flat whiteboard...,"Arrived on time, but box was bent as well as the whiteboard. This is the first time I've ever received damaged products so I'm assuming it was shipped already damaged, or in very poor packaging. Since I needed this asap, I just did my best to straighten it out and hung it up with a few extra velcro tabs to help it lay flat on the wall. For the price though, I'll keep it."
4,EXCELLENT INEXPENSIVE BOARD,"I bought this for the low price and it exceeds my expectations, and it arrived in one day! there are a few complaints here on the site, but i experienced no problems at all!"
5,Perfect! I love it,"I bought this item with Amazon prime delivery. I figured that Amazon will not mess up the shipping as other sellers may do.As expected, the board arrived this morning in perfect condition double boxed by Amazon. The seller was PLEXSUPPLY (I don't know if it makes any difference. I just went for the one available with prime shipping).The board is up and looks beautiful. I am so glad I bought it on Amazon and not a special order on Staples store for $40 more than what I paid here.**** Update: November 5 2010 *****It's been about a month and the board is performing well. My last board (that I bought at a local store) started staining and becoming permanent after a month or so, no mater how well I cleaned it. This board works well and keeps clean. I use it extensively every day, so I would know by now if something is not right. Overall I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Just what the office needed,"It's big, it's basic, it's inexpensive. I'm happy with my whiteboard. it has a tray to hold pens which some other do not. I don't need magnetic white board so it's a good value."
1,don't buy this!,"I should have heeded the other's reviews. The item was packaged very poorly and arrived with a hole through the cardboard and the dry erase board. Had very prompt response from the seller when I informed them of it, however, I had to contact them repeatedly to get my refund. Finally received my refund."
1,Board warped very badly,"Was very happy with this board, and marks erase cleanly without staining. However, the board has now warped badly and is unusable. Should probably upgrade to a better one."
3,You get what you pay for.,"After seeing many reviews about the quality of this board, I decided to order anyway. It was shipped by Amazon prime through amazon fulfillment and arrived quickly. The board itself was slightly warped and the box didn't provide much protection. After drilling through the metal to help hang it (it has clips on the back, but I wanted it hung better) and hanging it I noticed a small crack in the board as well.For the price I'm keeping it. However you definitely get what you pay for and if you want a better board you'll need to pay more money for one. It writes and erases just fine."
3,Large and Economic,I did not experience the bent or broken shipping that many others had.The packaging comments were well founded as the strength and thickness covering such a largedry erase board should have a stiffener down the middle inside to prevent the problem ( and nicer handling by the shipping carrier for sure). The dry erase surface is not high quality and a haze of what was formerly written takes an awful lot of work to remove it.
3,Good luck getting a good one,"The first one I ordered arrived cracked down the middle. The second one arrived fairly warped. The packaging is not up to par to handle being tossed around by package sorters. Product itself is good, needs better packaging."
3,Another one damaged by shipping,"As many have stated already, purchasing this is a roll of the dice. You may end up with one that comes as it is supposed to, then again you may end up like me and so many others with a damaged product. The box is not sufficient for UPS and Fedex. It looks like the box is meant to be shipped with like product in bulk.The box came to me with footprints on it and the aluminum rails were bent up pretty bad. More than could have been bent back and still used. I gave it 3 stars as it looks like it will work well once I get one that I can use.Also, there are no replacements for this. You must return it and wait for a refund and try again. If you need this product and cant wait, go to the store and just pay for it. If you are a patient person and want the best deal.....roll the dice.Good luck!"
1,Terrible Packaging,"The packaging was as bad as the other reviews indicate. The box was damaged, the packing material had shifted in transit, and the board was broken. I would not recommend purchase."
1,Worst Experience Ever!,"When it arrived, it was in a very thin box. I then opened the box, finding that the board was bent inward at the top corner. Because the board is very flimsy, I was able to bend it back into place. I then proceeded to installing it on the wall, which went pretty well. A day later, I noticed a chip where the paint had cracked off and left a black spot. Later on that same day, a sticky part on the side of one of my markers from where a piece of tape had formally been brushed against the board, taking the paint with it! So now, I have come to the conclusion that the board is very poorly made, flimsy, and I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone. I will be contacting the seller for a refund."
2,"Decent board, poor condition","The white board arrived in a box that was very dinged up. Upon opening the board was warped such that it doesn't hang flat on the wall. There is also a small crack in the board towards the bottom left hand corner.As for the white board itself, it's a decent product. Just the right size for my small home office. Mounting was a snap thanks to the included printed template and mounting hardware. Has a small tray on the bottom for storing your markers, though it's not quite wide enough for an eraser unless you balance it just so."
3,This is my second board,"The first one had a small hole in it and was bent. You can actually bend this thing back into place, I ended up keeping the first one. The second is on it's way back because it had a 7 inch crack in it. Whoever is in charge of packaging this item should be fired. The package should have a fragile sticker on it! The odds of this thing surviving a trip through the mail are very small. Nice product, bad shipping!"
4,Price over Quality,"This white board is inexpensive and it shows in its construction. Once hung, I found that it had a pretty significant bow to it. I assumed that this would be a problem due to how inexpensive it was and the other reviewers comments. However for the price in comparison to other white boards out there I am satisfied."
3,"Good product, shipping concerns","For the price, this white board seems to hold up well. If the board had arrived broken, or with cracks, I would not be so generous in my rating. As it stands, there are two corners of the aluminum frame that have shipping damage but it's not too severe.Shipping package could at least be marked fragile, it came in a large box with a sliver of Styrofoam around the edges. Not much protection for the product provided."
4,good enough,"at 50 bucks, i knew i couldn't expect much out of this bard. its definitely worth it. very roomy! the surface is of good qualityits a little flimsy...but, i didn't run into any problems cuz, i used 3M stickers to hang it on the wallgreat buy! i was lucky that my packaging wasn't damaged...if u read the other reviews, u'll realize thats a common occurrence"
2,Bad Quality,"Very very flimsy and mine arrived with a dent in the top left corner that I have covered with a post-it note. You are getting what you are paying for, so I'm not complaining too much. It's a good price for that big of a dry erase board, and it erases well and doesn't leave marks. Just hope yours doesn't come with TOO big of a crack!"
4,Whiteboard Is Good for What You Pay For,"The Whiteboard shipped ok, but I did have a small issue, and that is when I took the whiteboard out of the box, the board was bent outward at the center approximately 1 inch deep. This is a flimsy aluminum frame, and wasn't the result of the shipping. The frame wasn't bent but the actual melamine board. Did try to bend it back straight, no success, but it's only a minor inconvenience.Also if you look at the board closeup you can see these fine lines, as opposed to more expensive boards you won't see this, again you get what you pay for."
4,Melamine Board,This board was reasonable quality as we expected and we are happy with it. Much better than the light weight one we bought at Costco.
5,Good,"Order arrived in relatively good condition and in great time. It was slightly bent, but easily bent back and looks fine on the wall."
3,Okay but not perfect,"I ordered this whiteboard for use in my home office because it was significantly less expensive compared to comparable boards of the same size. I've only had it about a month.The positives: it arrived intact, erases well and is writes on well; basically, it functions well as a whiteboard.The negative(s): the board is significantly warped. I mounted it on my wall and eventually I had to nail the bottom corners down (there is no provided hardware to do this). When I write on it now, I can feel the board flexing, even though I was careful to mount it as flat as I could.All in all, this is a good whiteboard, just be aware that mounting it with the top two corner mounts is not sufficient to get it to lay flat against a wall."
1,Dry Erase Board Review,"We have purchased two of the 48x36 Dry Erase Boards and have received both boards with damage. With our first purchase, the board has bowed, had a bend in the lip of the board where the markers go and there is a 1 1/2 inch crack on the dry erase part, but the board is still useable. However, the second board we received was more damaged than the first. It had a significant bow in it, the lip had damage and there was about a 3 inch crack on the dry erase part and we have since returned that board and have asked for a refund. At this point we will no longer purchase dry erase boards from Amazon because the packing of the items has been significantly sub-par and we keep receiving our items damaged. We do understand that Amazon is only a third party and most of it and they may not be at fault, but if this is the kind of service we will keep receiving we are going to take our business elsewhere. Thank you."
5,Good whiteboard at a good price,"This whiteboard is pretty good quality, a little better than what I expected (for the price paid).It is not ""heavy duty"" and it is not meant to be. I have it set up on the wall in my office to help me focus.As others said, the shipping is not ideal - my board arrived a little warped on one side.However, all I had to do was stand the board up, grab both sides, and gently bend it towards the right direction.The metal frame was the part that was warped, and once I got that straight, the whole board became straight.It is very easy to hang up and use, and it is easy to write on and erase. I recommend this whiteboard!"
2,warped!,My board is warped and curling off the wall in the second day I had it hung! I suppose if I could mount it on the lower corners that would solve the matter--but really? No cool. But at least its cheap.
4,MacRae dry review,"Good board, sent on time, and easy to install. A little lighter-weight than anticipated, but erases well (no telltale marks) and looks good in my office."
4,Nice board,Was looking for a white board that was large and cheap to study with. Found this one and despite bad reviews about shipping board came intact. Everything writes smoothly and erases completely. Overall really like this product and would recommend.
3,Decent for the price....,"What more can you expect for such a good price? Shipping was fast, item arrived in fair condition. There were a couple of scratches on the board, but not a big deal.The tray is VERY flimsy. Every time I go to erase something, the tray falls. I finally just stopped using the tray.Overall, good product for the price!"
2,Such a Bummer!!!,"I bought this for my kids. I made them an ""art"" room up in the loft and seeing how much they love drawing on their little dry erase boards I figured why not get them a huge one! I read reviews from people who had problems with it being damaged due to improper packaging, but since this was going to be fulfilled by Amazon, I figured I wouldn't have that problem. Well...I did. You can see on the outer packaging 2 punctures in the box, which of course went through to the board. I'm not sure who packaged this, Amazon or Plexsupply, but whoever it was needs to improve on how they ship this. One would think maybe putting something in front of the white board (like another piece of cardboard or styrofoam) might help with any bumps the box takes in transit. I will be sending this back since it's damaged. Hopefully I can find another that can be shipped here without any damage. I am an avid Amazon shopper and I've never really had any problems, so this is really a bummer!"
1,Just Don't Buy It,"I bought this even after reading the reviews advising me not to and saying the packaging was terrible. And you know what: they were right. My board came in a package that wasn't fully sealed and had puncture holes in it. When I opened it the board was severely warped and had a puncture hole in it. A puncture hole! Do you really want to buy a whiteboard like this, that won't stay on the wall and looks like someone used it as target practice. I feel embarrassed to have purchased this after all the negative posts, and I think amazon should be embarrassed they still carry this product.At one time this may have been a decent product, but it is not anymore. DO NOT BUY. YOU COULD FIND BETTER WHITEBOARDS AT A GARBAGE DUMP."
1,Dry Erase Board COMPLETELY broken in half!,Packaging was awful and board was broken in half... each side detached from one another! Not amazon's fault. Plexsupply's fault!
1,"Universal Dry Erase Board, Melamine, 48w x 36h, Satin-Finished Aluminum Frame","Very cheaply made. thin, extremely pliable materials. item arrived damaged (frame bent, board had rips on writing surface) and was returned."
1,Don't buy this board!,"This is a great product so far, but it was poorly packaged and arrived damaged. I straightened the bent rail and marker tray and will use it as is, because I need it now, and it's too much hassle to return it. But if you want a good dry erase board that will probably not arrive in good condition, this is the one for you."
3,Whiteboard 3' x 5',"This was a very good price compared to retail office supply stores. However, the chalk tray was bent when we received it, but the church wanted it right away so we didn't return it."
2,Damaged in the mail,"Both Dry erase boards I received in the mail were damaged and some what broken.Nonmagnetic Melamine Dry Erase Marker Board, 36 x 48 (UNV43724) Category: Dry Erase Boards"
2,dry erase board,"I purchased this item for a Christmas gift. Although it came in a timely manner. It was damaged. Both the top and bottom of the board is dented. Since it is a gift, i didnt want to take the chance of returning it prior to Christmas and then not getting it back in time."
1,A candidate for a Golden Turkey Award,"I bought this film because of Carol Lombard and the enthusiastic reviews I read on Amazon.com. In fact, this film is a turkey, a laughable attempt by Paramount to emulate the genuine thrillers being produced at the same time by Warner Brothers. ""Supernatural"" is so corny, implausible, and so ineptly put together that your teenagers will laugh you out of the house should you be caught watching it. Poor Lombard, pretending to be a haunted killer whose powerful hands can strangle men. Poor Scott, forced to read lines (and wear a suit coat obviously to short for him) that would make a high school thespian blush. No wonder there are plenty of copies available at low, low cost. Anyone with an ounce of sophistication would want to discard this film as quickly as possible."
1,DO NOT BUY,Its amazing some idiot slapped a sticker that says professional grade Power Supply on this. Do not buy this no name garbage look for an Antec Corsair or Seasonic to name a few don't buy this I promise you will regret it. Cheap no name units can and usually will blow up AND SHORT OUT JUST ABOUT YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM. So please do not buy this.
1,Junk...Stay clear,"This piece of junk started once. When I unplugged the system to wrap the excess cables, It never started back up. Couldn't believe it. It was up and running just two minutes prior. To top it off, now my mother board is fried. Who's going to replace that? Luckily for me, Amazon has a return policy so I can get my money back but now I have to spend who knows how much to replace my mother board. Stay clear of this junk. If it happened to me, it may happen to you."
4,Classy Looking Wine Cooler,"This is a great size for a vacation cottage or to fit a smaller space. It's sophisticated enough to set different temperatures for the different wines. It has an interior light and a circulating fan. The instruction booklet gives you the 8 settings it has for various wines. The wine cellar looks good, so you could have it wherever you need your wine for meals or entertaining.Although it is quieter than other beverage coolers and small refrigerators that we've had, it still hums quite frequently. We had to move it away from our dining room so it wouldn't annoy us."
1,Not in Texas,Received my 6 bottle Cuisinart unit for Christmas. The requirement that the unit works best at room temperature below 70 degress is plain silly. In Texas one seldom sets the house thermostat below 78 degrees. With winter full upon us my kitchen temperature is 74 - 76 degrees and the unit will not cool below 55 degrees with continuous operation. Tomorrow it goes to the resale shop along with a couple of other useless gifts of Christmas past!
2,Very dissapointing!,"I bought this product hoping to be able to help preserve some of my better wines during the warm summer months. According to the insert with the product, if the room temperature is 77 then you can't do better than 54 in the wine cellar. My house temps usually run around 78+ through the summer, so this unit won't even make the 54 setting or the 57. I have it set at 64 and it continuously cycles on an off (every 30 seconds or so) with a fan that's very obnoxious and not at all quiet as advertised. On the insert and in bold letters they state ""This is a wine cellar, not a refrigerator."" I'm not so sure I would even call it a 'wine cellar'...more of an energy gulper (approx. 100 watts according to the user guide.)"
3,"Great book, horrible edition","First of all, if I were to rate the content of the book, it's a five star (at least). Exciting, touching, informative - definitely one of my favorite nonfiction books.Having said that, I unfortunately have to agree with Number Six, who complained about the reproduction quality of the pictures in the book. Originally I bought a different edition in South Africa and now I wanted to buy another one to give it to a friend. The photos of this edition here are horrible, literally like b/w copies from a 30 year old copy machine. This is especially annoying for a book about photography. Note that the pictures are b/w anyway, but the tones and contrast are just so messed up that it's truly embarrassing - definitely not suited as a gift. I recommend to try to get the other edition, it is available on amazon.co.uk from the publisher Arrow Books. Shipping to the US is naturally more expensive, but it's worth it."
5,Brutal - not just the photos but the message as well,"I can't even imagine how hard it was for these guys to write this book. Not only did they lose two of their best friends during the period covered by the book, not only did they have to watch people die in front of them, but they've come to realize that the photographs they were taking did not accomplishing what they hoped - to stop the violence. It's a harrowing but rewarding read, a real page turner."
4,A challenging read,"This is a difficult book to read. Stylistically it's well written, but the subject matter is bleak. It is a story of a country that is pulled in so many directions by the factions and ideologies and alliances and bloodlines that twist in on each other. And it is a story that confronts head-on the notion of what an individual can do to make a difference. There are no simple answers or neat happy endings. This is a book I would highly recommend though, if for no other reason than to gain an insight into the people behind the images that we see in our news media. It is easy to forget that while a story may only pass touch our lives for a few minutes, the journalists and photographers who seek them out will carry the memories with them for a lifetime."
2,"2 star for content, photo are 0 stars!","the content is informative - the image quality of the photos is horrendous. You can produce a better ""book"" using the booklet feature at your local photocopy shop. Contrast, tone etc. are specially important for black and white photography, and their inferiority is beyond belief in the book."
5,excellent for clean install,"It's super easy to install, Just align it right and two screws only. And after installing it, it is soooooo clean. I used it for putting my theater projector. The shelf blend in so well. Love it.I ordered three in total, I'm going to put a receiver on another one. The spec says it will hold 25 pounds, and the receiver is exactly 25 pounds. Let's see if it will actually hold up or not. :)"
4,Be the life of the party...,"The little ""product review"" referenced above states that you'll get ""second looks"" from passer-bys and what not. How true that is, especially if you, as I did, situate this little pup underneath your rear tires of your Hummer, kind of on his side, and then act as if you were simply backing out of, say, a driveway, when...DEAR GOD...what was that?...then begin, in a most panicked manner, asking around who has lost a dog...it is sure to get ""second looks."" When everyone realizes that it's simply a statute, boy howdy will you be the life of the party and get a million laughs from all. Try it out. Also works will in all manner of interesting ""arrangements"" with your garden gnomes and garden squirrels."
1,Pretentious,"This is so bad it's almost good. They sell it like it's RaymondChandler in space - but it's more like Raymond Chandler partially wrote a suicide note, got even more depressed, went for a walk, and then - in his absence - Ray's cat jumped up and down on the typewriter and completed it. Jeez."
3,Seems good...but not for me.,"This is the first opening book I ever read, and I must say that the lists of variations are overwhelming. Every so often the author includes 'ideas' behind a certain position, but I had trouble referring back to them in the jungle of variation lists. This book seems geared toward the more experienced (1800+) player than to someone looking to amass an opening repretoire. Perhaps I chose the wrong opening to begin with? Hope this helps."
2,Not leather,"This is not a leather case. The box clearly says synthetic leather. If you don't mind the vinyl smell, it fits the camera well. But it is a little tough to get the camera out by the camera grip."
2,Definitely Not Leather,"Amazon's product title is dead wrong: the box actually says ""synthetic leather."" My FZ50 doesn't fit as well as it should. Serves its purpose, but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably buy another (case logic) product."
1,not as describec,"The case was not ""hard"" nor leather. It was a synthetic material. My FZ50 did not fit well in the case."
1,AVOID,Ordered the spark plugs. Came in a box way too big with no filler material so the plugs where loose in the packaging. Installed them anyways. My car actually ran better with the old NGK spark plugs. I checked it found that the spark plug gap was wrong (gap not adjustable for these plugs). Had to spend more money and just purchase new plugs at local auto parts store. Do not purchase
2,limited to 3 spark plugs?,"I was going to order this item. When I went to checkout the quantity was changed from 6 to 3. It said this is a limited quantity item. Why would I only want 3 when my audi is a six cylinder? This is a stupid policy. If it said this on the product page I would not have put it in my cart. Instead, I had to waste time going through checkout only to find I coul not order the number of items I needed.I think I'll start doing my shopping elsewhere."
3,E3 plugs not what t hey claim,"I ordered these plugs seem to come very highly rated they lasted about 5 months then they failed car started spluttering ,bucking and just not preforming at all I was forced to revert to my trusty set of backups bkr6eix car is running smoothly dont think I would use them again ??"
1,True Cost = $450!!! PLEASE READ before you buy.,"I bought these after seeing them on TV. I'm not usually the kind of person to talk down a product, but in this case I feel obligated. I purchased these for my 2003 civic to replace my plugs. Within a month, the engine was stuttering and hesitating. I brought it for service and they said my ignition coils were failing and needed to be replaced. $450 for diagnostic, new coils and labor. At first I assumed it was just the coils' time to go... but my new set of coils didn't make it more than 2 miles from the shop before the engine started acting up again! Cylinders 1-3 were misfiring. Shop guys said the plugs blew out the brand new coils in 5 minutes flat! They replaced them and threw in some new plugs because they felt bad for me. Haven't had a problem with fresh coils and new plugs. I'm in the process of writing the company to see if I can get them to pay my bill. This is a clear case of crappy merchandise."
4,works better than bosch in motorcycle!!,"I have an older BMW 1100 gs they tend to have this wierd and irritating hesitation in the fuel injection system. The new bikes went to a dual spark plug configuration to eliminate the problem. I went to the e3 plugs . They work great! I could no long find the hesitation in the throttle. I couldnt believe it so I switched back to the all famous bosch platnium plugs. well it only took me a few minutes to switch back to the e-3 and they have been in there for three years now and still work great. I didnt notice a milege or horsepower increase but that wasnt the reason I tried them. I don't know if I will make to 100,000 miles with them but they have a good 20,000 miles in them and still gong strong."
3,Where's the economy?,"I've had these ""green plugs"" installed in my 2002 Subaru Outback for about 6 months and have yet to see any fuel savings. I suspect, however, that the fault is due to my computer being too ""smart"". I've been told that the computer senses less fuel coming out of the system due to the fuel savings of more efficient burning, and consequently dumps more gasoline into the fuel injector! So much for ""economy""!"
4,Awesome! More fun than Crazy Taxi!!!,"This game is an awesome bundle of fun! Much more fun than Crazy Taxi, by the way. I love how they chose unusual cities to drive in. Paris and Washington, DC, I believe. Now that's unique. I'm sick of San Francisco, and New York, and LA.I would recommend this game to any X box gamer!MC White said: X Box gamer 4 life, dawg!!!"
3,"Great driving action, dumb games","I'll be brief. The driving is great. The cities are cool and expansive. In that way alone, it is one of the best driving games out there.But the designer's sense of humor makes my skin crawl. Bad puns and stupid jokes are everywhere. The other problem is the programmers tried to design these little challenges for you to accomplish and they are all basically the same -- pick up people and drop them off, drive through checkpoints, hit cars until they stop. Put a dress on a pig and you still got bacon, ya know?"
3,Nothing new,"Out of all the driving games I've played, this one is nothing special. ""Midtown Madness 3"" is a street racing game that is just like Crazy Taxi. The gameplay consists solely of racing through the streets trying to hit checkpoints usually with a competitor in hot pursuit.This game is like all the other racing games but without the violence. There are quite a few different cars to select and drive around and they're all fairly easy to control.I'm sure that with Xbox Live, this game could be fun, but it still gets tiring after a while."
5,It was fun,"It is really cool being able to have lots of cars, and being able to drive them on the streets and in the subway."
4,UGGGGGGGHHHH,This is a great game however if you are looking for online play choose the PC version. The online play is not near as good as it was in Midtown 2.The Graphics are good and the driving is fun however the Story mode is Kind of Korny.If you are looking for a racing game that you are willing to spend 35$+ on then stick to Project Gotham. I would hold off until it goes on sale.
1,NOT PLAYABLE ON XBOX 360,"I love MTM3, but once I got my XBOX 360 and found it is not compatible and XBOX refuses to respond to my inquiries, I have decided to get rid of everything. EA Games should put pressure on Microsoft to get their act together. Until I can play some type of Midtown Madness on my 360, I will never buy another XBOX GAME, Accessory, or game from anyone."
5,"Could only have been better by running longer, and having more Niky!","If you're a fan, buy this disc. The sketch with Sam and Paul is worth the price, alone. I wish the special had run an hour, and I wish Niky Wardley had graced the screen longer (of course). Still, I'm standing firm on five stars."
4,Hilarious modern pirate read.,Unknown author but the way the main characters kept going from one bad situation to another was hilarious. Worth the time to read this book.
2,Disappointing,"This book was a great idea that didn't come to fruition. It's basicly a comic book without illustrations, or a B movie that you feel compelled to finish watching just because you started it."
5,You will love the way this guy writes!,This was his first book and a page turner it was! I had never heard of Keith Thomson before reading this one and have since read the other three of his books that I know of and am really looking for his next one due out this coming summer.
4,Great Lighthearted Action,"This is a book for those who love Caribbean action sagas, but tire of PI mysteries. A new, fun escape to the warm waters you crave!"
1,Ugh,Mostly gives a history lesson on pirates. Not my interest. I once lived in Pensacola and thought the book may have some local theme.
1,A waste of time,The book was poorly written & the story went from crisis to crisis with no sense of completion. I couldn't finish it.
1,a genuine do not read,wound give it less than a star and not worth the .99stopped reading and removed from device approximately 35% into it
5,Bleach Volume 10 Review,This was a wonderful product. No scratches. The box was in good shape and the seller was prompt in the delivery of the product. The show was awesome. The most exciting battle was one with Captain Zaraki and Ichigo. I liked the rest of the volume as well.
1,A classic case of pig-headedness ...???,"Dawn has a good voice, but does not know how to use it. She squeezes and strains her voice constantly, even on ballads. She seems unable to relax. It is the harshest singing I have ever heard. It is auditory purgatory. In the notes for this album she says, ""Knowing that it's impossible to please everyone, I've simply tried to please myself ... and I don't mean that to sound like I'm full of myself"". That is exactly how it sounds to me. I think people ask her to relax and sing softer, but she doesn't want to.The bottom line is that she had the talent to be a major star. But not the application. I've just listened to the samples for her 2007 independent release, and nothing has changed.On her website is this : "" ...Dawn Sears couldn't conform to the standards of the major labels - her standards are higher"". That was written with her blessing, so it is clear she is in total denial that she is the problem."
3,its not so bad and its not so good,one of the makeup item got spoilled (Maskara)and rest of them looks to be fine.
5,A wonderful escape,"Even though I am a diehard Milan fan, I really enjoyed this book of short stories. The stories are fast-paced, interesting and satisfying. Roberts has proved more than once that he is not a one-trick pony and this book is certainly an example!"
4,"TV Series, Airwolf",VHS tapes are on their way out thanks to DVD format. Order tape for picture on cover. TV series format was unreal but entertaining.
5,1965 Avengers Set 1,"DVD's were well packaged and were shipped quickly. It will be a Christmas present, but I am sure that the set will be enjoyed."
4,"Fond memories of an earlier age, my age","I always enjoyed the ETV series back in the sixties. Now I can see it again. Good action, good subtle humor and lots of that indomitable British flavor. It also helps one to see how he has changed. I find it to be good light entertainment. It's clean and the only hints of evil are normally the evil the 'Avengers' are fighting and defeating."
3,One-sided political rant from a side rarely heard,"Parenti offers some interesting ideas in this book. He disproves common myths, like the supposed liberal bias of the media, and raises some legitimate questions about how things are run. After a while though, his Marxist rants wear on you, his JFK conspiracy theories take up way too much space in the book, he seems to believe Russia was a perfect society under Communism - in other words, while it's interesting to hear from a Communist, it's easy to see why people shunned them so. The book ALMOST ends on a good note with some personal family tales...but then Parenti, for some reason, decides to end with three gosh-awful poems. Worth reading for a different take on things, but hardly convincing throughout."
1,The Dirty Truth is Senseless Propaganda,I was waiting for the book to blame conservatives for human mortality and to suggest that Liberals could solve it. This type of junior high school diatribe from the Left or the Right should offend us all.
2,ISO 9000:2000 In a Nutshell,"I believe this title is mis-leading, since it is written from the perspective of the 1994 standard. Comparing the old standard to the new is a excellent thought, but it should of been reversed. Infusing the old standard into the new, instead of the way it is layed out elements 1-20 interspersed with the new standard. If I were using this book as a resource in helping me capture the intent of the standard I would be sadly disappointed. This book misses the mark."
4,Read before your revisions,"As known by its users; ISO 9000 certificates must be revised and converted into ISO 9000:2000 certificates before December'2003. The book explains changes in the standard in detail, therefore provides a very good understanding of the new version in an easy way. It must be read by internal and external quality auditors besides quality management educators."
1,Poor Quality Tool Box from Klein,"Desc. on website is ""Heavy-Duty"", and ""Rigid Construction"". The item received was of very thin gage construction and visibly flexes when pressed down on with finger.Cheap latches incorrectly located.What was not in the item's description is that this item is Made in China. Kein used to make good quality tools, but now they produce in Mexico and China and their quality has suffered."
5,"Chilling poems by a great, forgotten Modernist poet","The Collected Poems of Weldon Kees is a gem of a book, depressing but deeply moving. Kees was one of the finest poets of the 20th century."
4,a dark poet,"Weldon Kees has been recommended to me by more than one person. And the reason is that he is a very dark poet, and a very interesting one at that. Kees is slightly outside of academia, though his reputation is getting bigger. I found his earlier work to be better than his later work, that's not to say that there isn't good stuff in his later work, just that I preferred his early work. I'd also recommend you did up a good biography of Kees, since he also has an interesting life."
3,Not much lyrics,"This is great music but if you can't remember the words, it's not a big help. Nice in the car, the melody cuts the stress of the terrible Atlanta traffic."
5,Szell makes each one outstanding,Seems that George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra did little wrong at the time of these recordings. They make each of these pieces into a great performance. Just enjoy some of the greatest music ever.
1,Poor design,"1) The player turns itself off after a period of inactivity. That might be a good thing except for the way it does so. The on/off switch is an in/out button. When the button is in it is lit. It stays in and lit after the player turns itself off. Thus you get the situation another reviewer mentioned where it looks like it's on, but it doesn't work and you have to turn it off and back on.2) You can't get your disc out of the player if the power isn't on.3) There is an unreasonable delay in opening the DVD drawer. There's no excuse for any delay, especially when there's no disc in the drive.4) If there is a problem with a disc it's possible for the machine to spend several minutes trying to resolve it - even after you press eject.5) I'm fed up with machines that do not have all of their controls on them and are required to be operated by remote. If it's on the remote, it should be on the machine."
1,Lasted 6 weeks,"The unit is incredibly clumsy. Often the door will not open unless the unit is turned off and on. The picture is not terrible and the remote primitive. No matter, though, because when I turned on the unit today the startup image was split in half and a large triangle appears in the middle reading PSCAN!The only contact for Desay -- and this is confirmed by Circuit City -- is an email address that bounces back with an error. Circuit City (Amazon's partner in selling this product), was unwilling to provide a refund, reluctantly offering a store credit. This is the second recent problem I've had with a return to CC that should have been a breeze. The first was for a memory card reader that was so out of date that it would not properly read recent cards. Circuit City's claim that they provide no-hassle returns is, in my experience, nonsense."
4,Good pad,"Nice that there are two. Put this on the bass head and was pleased that the sound wasn't affected. Play and rebound are equally unaffected and the divits that were beginning to form have ceased to grow. Application is simple, just make sure you've got it lined up where you want it."
3,Watchable Only For David Niven,"A bravura performance by David Niven - had never seen him do characters before. I'm so used to his consistent polished persona, this was the first time I had seen him act as anything but 'David Niven'. Awesome!You have to wonder why he never pursued other roles that could've showcased his amazing ability with various English accents?Candleshoe is an otherwise predictably average Disney live-action production for the period. Notable for having a young Jodie Foster as a street smart hustler pulled into a con orchestrated by the always enjoyable Leo McKern. His goal - use the girl to lead him to a hidden pirate treasure.This should be a two star, but Niven was really splendid in his brief, but memorable multiple roles. And that alone is worth a star - and at least one viewing.For a real treat and an infinitely more enjoyable Disney film utlizing a similar plot - consider screening Peter Ustinov's brilliant and hilarious performance as Edward Teach in ""Blackbeard's Ghost""."
3,spanish language music for gringos,"I like the Iguanas. What others complain about them I actually like...they change direction with each new album. They can rock, jam, big band, folk and sing ethnic music.I have never liked spanish language music. Nothing against the language but I always thought it took away from the ROCK. This cd changed my opinion.Essentially, the Iguanas are a New Orleans roots band that blends different styles. They are good musicians but they show restraint and rarely jam out on the songs (live they do extend themselves more).I feel that this is their most folksy work that embraces their spanish influences. My favorite song... ""Oye Isabel"" of course!This band should come out with a compilation cd"
5,bugaloo baby bugaloo,The item came in in excellant condition. Was fast in shipmentand I got everything that I was promised amd more. Just sit back and enjoy this great music with your friends.
5,Warm-hearted; quick read,"This is a great book for those looking into or in the process of an adoption from Guatemala. I read the book through in two days while completing our dossier paper work. The book was enjoyeable and I was glad the writer chose to include some photos. This isn't a ""how-to"" book, but a nice story of one families journey. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
2,Pretty overrated,"The controls are very difficult and I understand they wanted ""realism"" but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to EVERYTHING. I'm a long-time gamer and I can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme. Plus for all the people talking about immersion...I just don't see it. I just couldn't get myself to care about the world or story I was in; it didn't grab me like some games do."
2,What a disappointment,Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it. Clunky control system really put me off.
5,Don't Overlook This Game,"I just finished Gothic 2 and all I can say is.. WOW, what an awesome game. The story line was great and the slight quirkiness from this game having been translated from German to English helped make it unique. I really liked the ability to explore and do tons of unrelated quests without being trapped by a story line."
1,"Buyer beware -- Do NOT buy if you have ""always on"" internet access","I really, really wish I could write a good review for this game.Unfortunately, I can't run it. Reason why? I have a firewall on my computer system. Advice from the company that makes it: disable the firewall. Sadly, with an ""always on"" internet connection like many people have these days (DSL, cable modem, etc), today that is simply not an acceptable answer.Hopefully their next game won't have this fatal flaw. Oh, and just one star for me as well, for not researching this game better before I bought it. There's plenty of blame to go around."
1,STARFORCE !!!,"Purchased Stubbs-Zombie, Spellforce Platinum and Gothic Gold.I contacted Aspyr due to a ""key bug"" in Spellforce Platinum and found out(...customer support)Aspyr embedds STARFORCE in their games.I won't write another STARFORCE review: read Stubbs or Spellforce Platinum on my view and others on STARFORCE.I already own Gothic 2; great game.IMO, it's better than Gothic, which I rate 5 stars.Get the original; less potential problems."
4,As if!,"If you liked Jason Patric in Neil Labute's Friends and Neighbors and really really wish that character had his own movie, Expired will go along way to fulfilling your Jones. It's kind of hard to believe that Alpha Alpha Alpha would end up in this social pit but how else to see his fury in small ways. I would have pretended to be gay and given the target a makeover first because red lipstick is the bare minimum not bare faced, but that would have been too involved for a 90 minute movie that was never going to make any profit. Oh, well! Enjoy."
2,single use only,My daughter dressed up in it 2x and never even left the house - and the seams already tore! It didn't even make it to halloween!
4,It's wonderful,"This bag is great. Offers great protection for my cajon. I opted for the black 'professional' model over the camouflage model, as the strap looked like it would last longer. My only pet peeve is that it doesn't have a larger pocket. It's not a huge drawback, but I have some brushes I would prefer to carry in the bag, rather than carry an additional stick bag, or put them inside the cajon itself for transport. Other than that, it's a great product, that does its job well."
5,drum bag,excellent item; arrived within stated time; my daughter (receiver of gift) was very pleased and happy; correct size and fits her drum.
5,Simply the best (c) book about .NET,"If you are looking for good introduction.This book is your best choice.Very consistent, without any ""poetry"" (like in last Richter's book).Mr.Tapadiya's two book about COM+ and .NET must have any Windows developer."
4,Passed the first OCA/OCP SQL Exam,"I just read the 1st book in the kit and passed the first exam on OCA/OCP for 9i SQL. Got 54/57.Users have also to practice on other testing (or any other similar test guide) exams. Else, you may pass it borderline (or even fail borderline). So, a combo of this kit and an outside question-answer type practice exams should pass anybody.Now, on to my next course - Oracle 9i DBA Fund I !!"
1,SAME TYPE OF REVIEWS,"Are all over the places, for example, on bookpool.comis it the same word for word review, just the name of ""reviewer"" is different, it is "" Satish Vare from USA"". All these sale's pitches make me very unhappy, least to say and it doesn't add to credibility of selling company either!"
5,Another Masterpiece by the Master,"Any music educator you may converse with will no doubt know the name Frank Metis, for his name is synonymous with the most brilliantly arranged music books and individual compositions ever to be published. His choral arrangements alone number thousands of titles in print, not to mention hundreds of celebrity collaborations with everyone from Sondheim to Springsteen. His own composition ""The Enchanted Sea"", topped the charts in the 1960's and is still a big seller for Martin Denny. Whether you are an educator or a professional musician, this book, as well as as all of Mr. Metis's books will be a great asset to your work!"
3,"They ok,","they are ok the rumble feature is very good, but I'm sure someone mention that the left stick is really sensitive, I been playing zelda windwaker again, you can not believe how sensitive this thing is for aiming, anyways if you don't play zelda then you should be just find, I will be just like the wave bird controller, but heavier, most man would not mind the extra weight due to the batteries, mine had four batteries. The batteries will last longer without the rumble feature."
5,The best book,Even it is an old book. I have no found a book about this topic. I am Colombia and live ten years in U.S . It is hard to find a book that express better the cultural diferrence between anglo and latin. He speaks about time difference and views of life deiferences and give examples of his life amazing...great book.
4,WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW!,"I have been waiting for Ed Edd n' Eddy to be on a video game, i have seen screens and it has much better grafix than gba games by nickelodeon. I don't care what you say, GET THIS GAME (Mar 28, 2003) Also get Zelda the Four Swords and Budokai (DBZ) happy shoppin!"
4,IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS GAME READ THIS REVIEW!!!!!!,this game is o.k i first saw it in 1 of my younger brothers cartoon network magazine and i thought it looked good so i went 2 buy it and actualy well i dont no how 2 say it but i thought the game was pretty good!!!SO EVERY1 BETTER GET THIS GAME IF THEY WANT SOMTHING TO GET INTOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Cartoon Network hit!,"I am 10 years old. This is the perfect game for any gameboy advance gamer! It is very challenging, it has great gameplay, and wonderful graphics! A must for any Ed,Edd,n' Eddy fan."
5,Awesome,"Smoothe SylkThe last time I played smoothe sylk was in 1994 beforeI ordered my own copy last month, and it is awesome."
2,"OK...well, average.","This is not the most comfortable mules you will find. They look nice, but you wont be able to use them all day long if you do tons of walking."
5,ABSOLUTELY MAGNFICENT PERFORMANCE,"I owned the record version of this recording at 1 time. I especially always have held Eugene Ormandy in high esteem for being such a fantastic person and conductor and the Philadelphia Orchestra which he conducted for many years. I'm not the only person who held him in high regard. I read or heard somewhere that Sergei Rachmoninoff preferred his conducting to other conductors and the piano of Vladimir Horowitz together especially as they performed Rachmoninoff's Concerto #3 for Piano and Orchestra. But in this work he seems to excel along with his orchestral musicians and produce an absolutely magnificent performance. Most of all, I like Respighi's ""Pines of the Appian Way with the timpani drums and all the horn sections increasing in sound and volume."
4,"Southwestern Journals of Zebulon Pike, 1806-1807","Hart and Hulbert provide an outstanding and logical defense of the Pike Expedition and counter some of the lies and misconceptions associated with the journey. Basically written for historians and researchers, the book format is generally a reprint of the journals with interpretations and comments below each page. The forward by Mr. Gardner is very good, and the explanation of the purpose of the expedition is explained in relative detail. Generally appropriate for anyone interested in the exploration of the Louisiana Purchase, but ,once again, even more interesting to researchers and historians.-T.R."
4,Really Neat Journal of American Exploration,"If you are a fan of American exploration a la Lewis and Clark and enjoy reading excerpts of travel journals, you will find this book interesting. While it does focus at times on the political wrangling relating to the US's expansion post-Louisiana Purchase, and contacts with the Spanish, it remains a fascinating tale with which most history buffs are not famliar.Having traveled in the areas of Colorado described therein I found it interesting and enjoyable. Though not a book for the casual reader, for those of you interested in the subject matter and time period this has proven to be a wonderful gem of a discovery and I would encourage you to read it."
1,damaged my hair..keeps breaking,"I have used hair coloring for 28 years so it is safe to say that I would notice a difference using something that really damaged my hair. When I first used the product, I loved the color...it was ash blonde and was so natural looking....I started noticing my hair breaking off on one side after a while and at first could not believe what was happening...I googled to see if others had this experience but noone has written about it...my hair looks horrible now and for the first time in 28 years I am actually afraid to try any new product for fear my hair will break off more...so, I say my experience may be an isolated incident or may be something others have experienced as well...just wanted to say...be careful this doesn't happen to your hair..."

4,Great Wartime Propaganda/Adventure!!,"To enjoy this movie, you have to get past the wartime propaganda. If you can, this is a great escapist flick! Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan carry the show, with superb supporting roles by Alan Hale and Raymond Massey. If you like war movies that were produced during WWII, this one should be at the top of your list!!"
5,Desperate Journey,My dad was so happy to receive this movie. It came packed so well he is going to save the packing. I want to thank the seller for this movie. My dad has been looking for this movie for over a year. I am so glad that I was able to buy this for him for his birthday. Again thank you so much.Could not be happier.Thank YouMrs. Cynthia Sanchez
5,Love these guys!,I happen to work with the wife of the lead singer and I have to say this has got to be one heck of a great band. Most of them are Canadian who live here in Japan. They are all fluent in Japanese and most of their songs are half in Japanese half in English so it sounds really cool. This has got to go main stream in the states but from what I have heard they are more into just staying here locally in Japan. You should definitely check them out.
4,Best of the Original Monty Python,"Disk 5 contains some truely classic monty python. I have several other disks but disk 5 is my favorite. While I am a true python fan and there is not an episode I don't like, certain episodes (on other disks) have their low points. For example, the ""dead parrot"" sketch and ""self defense against fresh fruit"" start with a premise which is not all that funny, then beat it into the ground. Disk 5, however, is highly entertaining from start to finish. ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition"" and ""Poet McTeagle"" are particularly good."
5,The Flintstones,This is a awesome soundtrack this soundtrack is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all them of if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
5,Cute read!,I loved this book when I was young. My children loved this book. And now my grandkids are enjoying this darling story.
5,Humbug Witch,"I read this book to 42 classes of 3, 4, and five year olds over the years and some grandchildren. I'm so happy to have found it again!It's a great story to explore the scary parts of Halloween with small children and the story line, with Fred, the cat, is attention keeping."
5,Pomegranate Body Lotion,"Wow, this lotion smells and feels great! It is lightly fragranced and not overpowering. Will always keep an extra one of these on reserve, as I don't want to run out of it."
1,Weak,"I dind't like this version of the Little Red Riding Hood. Graphic work is poor, story different from what I was used to when I was a child. That cute music when Little Red Hiding Hood is heading to the Grandma's house is not present on this DVD. I'm still looking for a better version."
3,Fearless and unrealistic.,"A wonderful read all the way to the last chapter or so when ""Hollywood"" took over. An accurate depictment of combat throughout until one's imagination went astray."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Three quarters of the way through The Fearless Man, I simply abandoned reading it.While the experience of the grunt in Vietnam was captured realistically, the characters were two-dimensional - from Mac to the Chaplain to the women back home . A shame because Pfarr's Vietnam is vivid and harrowing. But to truly add depth to the novel, a good deal more craft is required."
3,c&s bird seed wreath,arrived with big break in the wreath but still usable tho not a great gift the birds won't mind much.
3,Bad packaging by Amazon???,"I ordered 2 of theses wreaths for Christmas presents and they were shipped with a few other things, but the biggest was a car cleaning kit that was rather heavy. One of the wreaths was beautiful and intact the other was broken and useless.... I am thinking it was a packaging/shipping issue."
2,Old product,Wreath was very dry; must have been an old one. But I called C & S and they replaced it!
1,Exploded before first ride,"I've been riding bikes and installing tires for over 15 years now and this might be the worst tube I've tried. I had it on the rim, inside the tire, and at 33 PSI during the first fill up, it exploded in my hands (recommended PSI is 90). Took it off the wheel and it had split right down the seam of the tube. I bought a 2nd tube for the other wheel and it's inflated at around 50 PSI with no problems so far; might have been a lemon tube?"
2,Nothing more than watered down bleach!,"I used the entire bottle on my boat. I was not impressed at all! It is nothing more than a weak Sodium Hypochlorite solution! Save your money, buy Clorox Clean Up or the Great Value brand, and rinse very well, especially on the threads."
1,Cap/Sprayer Broke,I ordered this product to tackle mildew stains on a plastic lounge chair. I wish I could give it a better rating but unfortunately as I used it the cap and sprayer broke. The cap had a 1/4 inch horizontal split in it and the sprayer pops out of the bottle when you try to pump it causing the chemical solution to leak onto your hand. What little product got on the chair removed only 50% of the stains. Unfortunately I can't send it back as I waited beyond the 30 day return policy to try it out.
5,Great Product,We had a problem of mold on the boat seats that occured over winter storage. After trying to clean with the regular cleaning solutions we needed something that worked. Although it is not fast acting it is a great product. Just spray it on and wait. You can see the difference in a few hours. Repeated applications has the seats looking like new... Just have patience...You will be happy!
1,This isn't a value you should teach kids.,"I identified with Elizabeth, I really did. Let's just say her life mirrored mine in a lot of ways. But this book teaches misfortunate children that all of their sufferings are their fault bacause they are inherently evil because of the so-called ""Original Sin."" Do your kids a favor and buy them a book that doesn't teach them that a beautiful, natural act of love is sinful, or teaches them to follow a hypocratic doctrine like a sheep. This series teaches the wrong things about christianity, and was one of the influences that led me away for years.Teach your kids to follow their own heart"
2,Was nice but,"I liked it but I was pissed to find out you had to pay, after I found that out I took it back to the store. And only a few people on a server also sucks."
1,phantasy star online 1 and 2 for xbox,"Trying to play this game was bad because if you tried to play it on the regular xbox it requires the xbox live account. For whatever reason my xbox would not allow me to create an account, trying to play it on the 360 said it requires certain codes that are to be downloaded from xbla, but after that i had already given up on the game.=(=( Even to be able to play offline you had to be set up online which pissed me off forever more."
1,dont buy this game on xbox,"Its just a useles game disc but a nice frisbee. The game needs an xbox live gamer tag to play, plus this game wont work on the 360 and if your aware there is no way to make a gamer tag on the original xbox so this game is obsolete. But you can get the gamecube version which is alive and strong. DONT buy this from any seller. I found this out the hard way and its my own fault."
5,Phantasy Star Online,product arrived 2 day after ship date! excellent condition and prompt delivery.
4,Did it freeze AGAIN?!?!,This game is the funnest one i have and i would play it all the time but im a little frustrated right now. My game has freezed so many times!! I am getting sick of it. I am going to buy another copy to see what happens. Wish me luck...
5,Are the extra fees really worth it?,"There is something special about this game. Not just in the game itself, but in the community you are drawn into when you play online. You meet incredible people with the same intrests as you have.I'm sure by now you have heard all about the money that will be needed to play, online or off. But if you are like me, you will do anything to play this game again. I dont currently have a highspeed connection to play online, but i am getting one soon. If there is no way you can get a high speed connection to play online, I say pass, because honestly, the game itself is not worth both the combined purchase price of the X-box live starter kit and the game:$... But if you are even considering getting a high-speed connection some time in the near future, pick this one up fast.This is going to be a special online community that will last a very long time to come. See you online (in about a month when i finally get DSL)"
3,I am soooo angry,"I love this game. I played it on dreamcast and gamecube, and although you CAN go online with those, you don't have to, and you surely didn't have to pay if you just wanted to play offline. I bought this at a gamestop because I loved the earlier versions, I put it in my xbox, and all of a sudden, I realize that I couldn't play it. I'm really mad. However, if you don't mind paying more every month, go for it, it's an amazing game."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,I would like to say this is a great game. I would settle if I could say this is a decent game. Alas I cannot as this game is unplayable. I bought this game used about 5 months ago and I found that you cant even start the game unless you have signed up for the online network (which conveniently no longer exists).
2,comme le jeu sur dreamcast plus les frais...,"ce jeu est pas mal ressemblant a la version de dremacast , pas grand amelioration graphique. aussi le probleme est que l on dois payer 9.99$us par mois pour jouer en plus de devoir etre inscris a xbox live. ca fais cher pas mal pour un seul jeu. je ne le recommande pas a moins que vous soyez un grand fan de ce jeu."
3,"Great game, terrible platform","Phantasy Star Online for Dreamcast is tied with the Sims for Mac as my favorite video game of all time. It's just gorgeous. The graphics, the sound, the adventure, the intellectual stimulation of mags and weapons, the feeling that I really am on another planet--I can play for many, many hours and not get tired of it.Unfortunately, I can't play PSO for Xbox, because I don't have a high speed Internet connection and I wouldn't be able to afford xBox live even if I did. It is a stupid, stupid, stupid thing that I can't even play the *offline* version without an xBox Live account."
3,not able to play without....,i would have given this 5 stars but you need xbox live to play it even if your gana play it in offline mode
2,Don't waste your time or money on this product!,"i've used this product for about a month, and have noticed no difference in my skin. i do not think it's worth paying 40-some dollars for--or even $10! it works okay as a face scrub, but a small loofah sponge works way better and is cheaper to buy. also, this is a product that is meant to be left on overnight, so if you have any sores on your face (like acne) this product can really sting! It says on the package that it's also supposed to help hydrate your skin, but cold cream used sparingly works much better.fyi, i am 21-years-old, so perhaps i would like this product better if i were older & dealing with wrinkles....idk"
5,useful tool to help understand book better,Just as promised. Arrived in timely fashion & packaged well. Spark Notes are a great tool when reading assigned books - helps bring understanding to the text before reading the book.
4,Express Yourself Clearly,"I bought the EYC cd only because I knew of Trey Parker from the Disney musical Newsies (1992), but I ended up loving the cd. Some of the lyrics seem like they were written in a haste, but they are actually quite funny. My favorite song on the cd is Swing My Way, which is actually the demo song (which doesn't mean anything to my knowledge). The rest of the songs are generally good too, and fun to listen to. If you like boy bands such as NSYNC or Backstreet Boys, I highly recommend this cd."
4,Well Written,"I enjoyed this book. Also, found it quite helpful -- since I know a Narcissist personally. But, I didn't realize that he had a clinical condition prior to reading this book. It fit him like a glove!!! I don't find Dr. Lowen's Freudian orientation objectionable--that's his perspective. Yes, it would have been nice if he had delineated alternate (non-Freudian) theories too, but it isn't required. After all, he probably doesn't agree with them. Unlike some of the reviewers, I don't think Freudian theory has been utterly displaced in psychology. I think there's room for lots of approaches and that if psychologists and therapists took a more eclectic view, they'd be far more successful in treating their clients/patients. By the way, while I did study Freud (and others) in colleges, I'm basically a Jungian layman--not a Freudian."
3,Interesting perspective on the subject matter,"The one thing I liked best about this book was that in the first chapter, the author admitted that he has a Narcissistic personality. I admired that he was able to present a viewpoint which was that much more honest and authentic. I have read a few other books on this subject and I have a personal interest in it, so I have read and am reading a vast amount of material on the subject at this time. In comparrison to some of the other books, this one is right in the middle- Not too clinical, but also lacking a little bit of soul. I recommend it as an introduction into this dark and deep subject matter."
3,A Good Start,"Your mother, father, sister is a narcissist? You think your mother is seducing your son into a trust and intimacy that excludes you, the parent? Here you go: situations that are prevalent in Western Society and explained in real terms. This is a very good place to begin your journey - a place to say, ""A-ha! That's the root of my problem,"" and then move on to therapy, other books, more ideas, and so on. Worth the money."
2,Flawed,"I find it interesting that this book was written for narcissists, the last sort of person likely to read anything on this subject. While the patient examples he presents are valid -- and sound a great deal like people I know or their relatives -- his methods are squicky and his prejudices are highly suspect.He lost me completely in the last chapter when talking about dignity and honor, two concepts important to me. He considered it dishonorable for teachers to go on strike, citing self-sacrifice and higher duty as their appropriate priorities. He appears never to be aware that most US teachers are grossly underpaid for the important work that they do. His criticism of our concept of success also leaves out the human need for improvement of one's circumstances and that the drive for financial success is not always about narcissism.I've read better books on this subject."
1,Interesting but Insane!,"Parts of the book are interesting and intriging. He gives a good definition of Narcissism but the clinical aspectof his approch to patients was just ""insane"" very weird...The ""Oedipal Situation"" so at around 3 to 6 I might have thought I wanted my mother to die??? That is absurd and if any therapist I don't care how educated he is get's 12 inches from my face and ask if I want to kiss him..I would vomit...Ever heard of ""boundaries""...lol...Well maybe if he was attractive I could deal with it....but that's wayyyyyyy off...Anyone who would think this is normal please feel me in; because I see this approach as completely irrational and creepy..Did not get to the end of the book but come on... it was just a little to off of the road at times and I'm the most opened minded person you could ever know...."
2,"Interesting, but out-dated","This book does have some very interesting information, however Lowen seems unfortunately rather dated. This is especially evident in his repeated reference to Freud's Oedipal/Electra complex which has been discarded by modern psychologists. Nonetheless, a good, quick read."
1,Wasted my money,This book was not an easy read. It got deeper than I cared to go - too wordy. I gave it to my friend and she didn't like it either.
2,For the sexually abused,This book is more for ppl whom have been sexually abused. It pertains to that type of reader.This book does not always make sense. It has too many clinical details.
4,Thoughtful and useful information.,"I found this book to be truly helpful in understanding the dynamics of the narcissist's inner world. Beyond that it offers insight into ways that narcissism can be treated. Modern Psychiatry holds that it cannot be treated, only controlled. Dr. Lowen offers hope to those diagnosed with the condition; through body memory release work. This book is a must for those who have a family member diagnosed with narcissism."
5,This book has changed my life absolutely!,"Lowen's insights into the machinery of the self are enlightening, simple (but not obvious) and effective for creating personal change. His ability to sense and communicate the unions of the body and mind, and the emotional past and physical present is nothing short of genius. He talks about orgasm, so people think he is ""too sexy"" and he writes with out academic technical pretense so people think he's ""common"". And he is common. Common as air and water and as rare and refreshing as truly fresh air and clean water. I give this book to people that I care about and those that are ready to hear its wisdom, thank me."
5,Awesome DVD and I still have 10 fingers!,"This was a complete guide to using knives in the kitchen, which may sound dry, but was funny and entertaining. It is a great price and great value for anyone looking to sharpen their own cooking skills.Plus these guys teach cooking classes in Berkeley at Kitchen on Fire, so I can check them out in person!"
3,alright,okay for a amatuer . typical over the top american acting wich is anoying but fundermentals okay
2,bla,"I debated about giving these 1 star, but the concept and craftsmanship are there.these did not fit well ( and i looked at two different sites for proper sizing, just to make sure). the cover actually made it more difficult to clean."
4,Verry nice,This is what i expected from Dans very well made heavy prod to own it.Nice peace to add to collection.Dan Pennington
1,Junk,"This item is made so cheap had I known it, I wouldnt have even considered it.Walmart sells one for the same price and is made much more durable."
4,Good for it's size,"I agree with another reviewer that this clipboard is not that sturdy, but for me it was the only one I could find of this type that wasn't too deep. It comfortably fits a notepad, checks, deposit slips, and pens - perfect for keeping my trips to the bank organized. Also, the writing pad is actually quite durable - much like a metal cookie sheet. This slim, professional looking clipboard works for me."
1,Misleading............,"Aelous Down Pillow........I thought that I was buying a ""down"" pillow. ""Aelous Down"" is the name of the company. What a surprise to find a feather pillow with 5% down. I hate to be misled! The ad says machine washable, but the pillow label states DRY CLEAN ONLY. The outside cover of the pillow feels soft to the touch, but when you put your head on it you hear a plastic sound. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
2,5% down!,"I have had/bought feather & down pillows for many many years. I understand the price is excellent. As a matter of fact it IS too good to be true. But the ad DOES read as if it is 100% down. I would be happy if it turned out to be 50%. But 5% is negligible & means it is ""crunchy"" sounding, kind of pokey in your ear, and definitely not as cushy as mostly down. It is misleading. The point, as with the previous rater, is I don't appreciate misleading advertising, even if it is 1 cent."
4,Fast and affordable,The price on this product was well below what I was expecting. The order went smooth and the product was at my door within days. It's really helped with the graphics on my 5 month old PC. I couldn't be happier.
3,now i can play COD4,"ok so it's got better performance then the nvidia gforce fx5500 i had, of course it's all about twice the specs.the sofware that came in the CD for the gcar partially worked, so i downloaded the updated catalyst and driver now everything is ok.i'm a little decieved since my HP laptop came with a ATI GPU (radeon express 200M) and works VERY smoothly even though the framerates are low (20-40fps minimal video quality settings), and this x1600 pro is somewhat glitchy on the same games that i play on my laptop (70-100fps minimal video quality settings also), maby because my PC is homemade but i did not have those problems with the Nvidia card or is my PC getting old?? dunno, but for the price and the games i can play with this card, plus it's AGP, i am satisfied with itoh and there are also some tools if u are interested to monitor ur GPU temperature and tweak the clock... not for newbies sorry, if u don't know how to use u'll probly burn ur gcard in 30 secs"
3,Dissapointed!,"I bought this card thinking it would be a major upgrade from my Radeon 9600 Pro, 128 mb, and I was completely dissapointed! Granted, this card may be an awesome performer when it comes to digital movie playback and things like that, but it sucks in gaming! Going to trade it for an X800XL."
3,Musical style mistake,"Hello Amazon shoppers:I just want to say that Virus is from Argentina and it doesn't play any type of metal, they are a classic 80's pop rock band, and pretty good. Don't be confused by its name, sounds evil, but it's not!Yours trulyMGS"
3,Too Expensive,"Although the music is absolutely amazing, it's too expensive for how few songs there are. The quality is great but there's only four songs; two of the songs are the same song, too, though one is with vocals and the other is without vocals. Try and find it cheaper first but if you can't, this is a good buy."
1,Picture tube has a problem,"My personal experience:I bought the Samsung SyncMaster 700NF monitor as it had excellent display resolution and I liked it.The problem:The display just goes blank, with the picture tube just not working. The LED on the front goes from solid green to blinking yellow.I have taken this very heavy 40+ lbs monitor back an forth to the Samsung service center 4 times now and this problem has not been fixed, they even gave me a different monitor and this problem still exists. Not a good experience for me. Maybe I got lemons :("
2,3C UV Light by Streamlight,"Fairly nice light but too bulky and the Xenon bulb is not as good as the new K2 L.E.D.'s out there, I sold mine and purchased an Element K2 at Sams Club a 2 pack for $24.95 and bought a separate UV light and I am much happier, the 4 L.E.D UV I purchased is brighter than the 3C UV streamlight and batteries are more common for rechargeables AAA."
4,Good tool but could be brighter.,"The main question I have is why they have 2 levels of UV brightness? The brighter setting (6 LED) is barely bright enough, the dim (3 LED) setting is worthless. The white light is OK but also could be brighter and would be nice to be LED also (but is an expensive Xenon bulb)"
5,cag88,works great use it almost everynight to hunt scorpions. we have another uv flashlight that puts out a bright purple light but this light puts out a dim purple light and makes scorpions glow brighter not having the extra light being put out. also works great for detecting a/c system leaks
5,Insane!!,"Alexei takes us on a madcap adventure of a train ride turned murder mystery. This book is completley insane! Along with the mystery we get wild tales about train rides as a kid,football,sex,and just about everything else all crammed into 152 pages of lunacy! There is no point in writing about the murder mystery because its basicly background music,for Alexei is all over the place including hilarious sketchings of whats brewing in Alexei's brain. If you like to laugh or are in any way an Alexei fan you must read this book. And all Alexei's books for that matter."
5,Peterson's Butterflies,This is for the person who likes to color and learn something at the same time. Each butterfly is described in detail and all illustrations appear in the covers in full color. Colored pencil artists will enjoy blending their colors to come up with the range of hues found in these butterflies.
4,wrong size listed,"i got this to go in a 5 in gap item was listed as a 9"" wide it is only 6"" wide well made though"
2,Old thinking,"This is a nice, easy read that can be credited with adequately summing up contemporary ideas in the Christian faith. More importantly, many of these ideas have been developed in past centuries, and have been conluded by contemporary scholars as philosophically obsolete. If you're looking for some commonground between Chrisitan theology and logical validity, I'd suggest reading the Summa Theologica by Aquinas or even Aristotle...Either way, try to maintain some perspective, which was severly lacking in Permissive Ignorance."
5,"The sun, the sky, the wind in your face","I like to take this kite backpacking.I have flown it over the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania,Mt. Michelson in the Brooks Range of Alaska at the Arctic Oceanand in my hometown. When its up high I love it. I have put it on a line and through a fishing pole and ""troll"" the kite behind a boat. You sure can't have this much fun with a board game or a GameBoy.Having a bad day??? I say...""Go fly a Kite!"""
1,worst kite ever,"The kite never flew. I should have listened to the bad review above. It gets in the air about 15 feet, and immidiately dives. I've never had any problems flying other kites."
2,Absolutely HORRIBLE!!..but kinda fun,"Having grown up in the 70's, I had my fill of Kroft Superstars and it was good clean freaked out fun. This special is SO bizzare and silly..words cannot even describe it. They pan to the audience several times and its the SAME footage over and over! The audience members look almost as strange as the characters on stage, witcheepoo is a fake! (I think), and Johnny Whitaker from Sigmund starts the whole thing off with a dreadful song about needing to have freinds. Then he tells the dumbest joke I have ever heard in my life. Weird and totally dumb, yet I must admit I think I may buy this video for kicks. P.S.-check out Anne B. Davis and Robert Reed sitting in the audience."
1,trash it,"When are they going to make a picture and use the right actors. A black GI in Waffen SS uniforms, there wouldn't be a chance in hell that would of happen."
3,"Bonjour, hepcat","Zwerin is no doubt an interesting cat -- not unlike David Amram -- deeply invested in a complicated past -- musician on the Birth of the Cool sessions -- expat in Paris & invaluable jazz columnist for the international Herald Tribune (the rag Jean Seberg peddled in 'Breathless') -- his cut & paste memoirs are so coy & cloying that this reader had to aggressivley cut through the grease to the scattered gems & direct-hits -- sketchy & self-lathering, these episodes can't quite reach beyond the vanity press ka ka -- the lingering odor of vanity w/ slithery insights & veritas are deeply bogged down by hep hip narrative-- Zwerin's book on the jazz scene in wartime Paris is much more sustained & useful -- check it out --"
2,Not the best beginniers guide to diabetes,"Easy to understand, but very repetative and specific to the authors mother. Leaves many questions unanswered for the new diabetic but might make a good adjunct to some solid teaching materials."
1,Totally Disappointed,"I am a true to the heart, die hard New Edition fan. I have all of the group albums and all of the solo albums(Johnny too). To me this album was terrible attempt by Ralph to keep up with the other singers that were talking about things of a sexual nature during that time. Like R. Kelly, Aaron Hall, Silk, Keith Sweat, bandmate Johnny Gill and many others. I was totally feeling his solo debut and still play it to this very day. ""When I Need Somebody"" is the best song on there. The rest is not worthy of play. I have to say that this cd will be collecting dust with the rest of the one song cd's that I have."
3,"C+; the ""F"" tunes bring this project down","""Graveyard"" -A""Shaky Ground"" - A""Who's The Mack"" - C""It's Goin' Down"" - A""You'll Remember Me"" - F""My Aphrodisiac"" - A""When I Need Somebody"" - A""Sex Maniac"" - B""The Booty Affair"" - A""Love At First Sight"" - F""Your Touch"" - F""G-Spot"" - C""Sex-O"" - C"
1,A waste of time and money...,"I anxiously awaited Ralph's sophmore album and rushed out to by ""It's Goin' Down"" the day it was released. What a waste of time it was. Considering that there was a three year period between this album and his first, I expected more instead of this haphazard mess. The songs were poorly produced and lacking in lyrical content. The best part of this album is when it's finished playing. I can't say enough how disappointed I was. ""It's Goin' Down"" is definitely not Ralph at his best."
2,Treasure Trove of Economic Fallacies,"This book is a delight to read, if only because McFague manages to compress so much economic illiteracy into a single book. Zero-sum game fallacy, the confusion between matter and resources, dependency theory, the idea that the market economy destroys the environment, the identification of a market economy with consumerism. They're all here in abundance! I would give the book one star simply because it displays such ignorance about a subject it claims to analyze. But some credit must be given to McFague for packing so many mistakes into so small a space, and for lacking any sense of irony for enjoying a cushy high level academic salary while disdaining all those consumer-driven lumpen proletariats who get by on half her salary."
4,muffins,Great little cookbook for muffins. Who knew there were so many varieties of muffins? Nice addition to any collection of cookbooks.
4,"""A new breed of vampire that seems more real!""","I very much enjoyed spruill's use of modern medicine to create such colorful, yet frightening characters. ""Could there really be hemophages out there now?"""
1,Utter Garbage,"An almost painful read book, chock to the brim with dimensionless characters, flimsy plotlines, cliches and writing that is just plain bad. The villain is the only character with any complexity. The protagonist is such a sickly sweet hero that he is almost instantly hatable. I found myself rooting for the bad guy. Other cliched characters abound, the smart beautiful love interest who gets menaced by the antagonist, the kindly and self-sacrificing side-kick, not to mention the virtual plethora of pitiful children who are, I suppose, expected to tug at our heartstrings but manage only annoy. The premise is shabby. The ending is both gruesomely satisfactory and irritatingly sentimental at the same time. If you're a fan of shallow formulaic tripe, buy this book."
5,Zane is my hero!,"I was never a big fan of vampire stories, but this is more than a vampire story. This was one of two books (the other being Daughter of Darkness) that actually made me feel, it made me actually feel what the characters are going through. A beautiful story that portrays the relationship between Father and Son, Father and Daughter, and the love between two people from different worlds and their loyalty toward one another. It's a wonderful book."
5,believable baddies,"Pacy thriller which describes a race of people, hemophages, which walk among us, feed on us and upon which stories of vampires are based. Through Spruill's persuasive writing and the odd happenings of this world, throughout the story this breed of hemophage became quite believable! I am looking forward to the sequel to this story."
5,If you're a fan - it's great!,"I saw ""The Desert Song"" when it was first released. I am a fan of Gordan MacRae and Kathryn Grayson. If you like light opera and romantic story settings this is great. The one thing I didn't like is it is not on DVD. My VHS copy was very good, however. It's a collector's item for sure."
2,GIFT,This video was purchased for an 89-year-old woman who loves to watch old movies. I do not watch movies...especially ones as OLD as this one! I cannot review it since I never intend to watch it.
3,Desert Song,"Watched this movie dozens of times at a youth, but not up to current movie standards. The music is great."
2,get a real handbook,Don't waste your money on this book. It covers the topics much too lightly to be useful for anything besides assignments. Get something like the Machinery's Handbook instead.
2,"A broad book, but lacking in details","The book covers a broad range of problems in machine design but lacks clear explanations and citations. Often times in sample problems the author's solution skips crucial steps or fails to cite information. The section on fasteners is lacking as well. It also does not mention AN or NAS fasteners. Too many coeficients are taken blindy from charts which are not cited. This makes the problems in the book little more than blind ""plug & chug"" type problems. One might expect this from a first or second edition high school book, but not a fourth edition college text."
3,"good in the theory part, bad in the application part","Generally, books with this title are composed of two parts: theory and machine application. The two parts are written in very different manners.This book is very good in theory part. It could be used for a quick reference at your workplace. It contains various topics from solid mechanics and explains them clearly.However, the machine application part is not as good as the theory part. The largest problem is that new concepts are introduced in the problems, not in the text. Although examples are given, they only give very basic plug-and-chug problems. You will find yourself FOOLED when you try to solve the practice problems. I learned more from the solutions manual than from the text. The book keeps doing that in most chapters of machine application part."
2,"Cool cover, poorly written",The book has a lot of errors and the examples do not clearly show all the steps. I found it very hard to learn from this book and spending a lot of time skimming through the text to find the important content.
1,**NOTICE** NOT COMPATIBLE AS STATED,This item is NOT compatible with 400 or 800 series PDAs. Be warned before ordering. I'm having to return mine due to this mistatement of compatibility in the heading
1,Do not fit 2004 Audi allroad,"These wiper blades do not fit a 2004 Audi allroad, despite the fit wizard that says that they should. The package says that they will fit A6 models from the late 90's through 2001. One is 21"" in length, the other is 22"" long. They use the same U-shaped coupling as the rear wiper blade on the allroad, not the coupling on the allroad's front blades."
1,NOT exact fit for 2009 Porsche cayman,The blades look exactly like the original but the passenger blade is 1 inch shorter than the original on the car. I
1,Wrong Item,I ordered the item as described however when it arrived is was a different threshold. A pain to return; I'll figure out a way to make it work.
2,"It's only a wall mount, not ceiling mount","Title is deceiving. Package does not include longer L shaped ball joint to mount to ceiling. Another problem is, ball itself is some cheap plastic and is getting worn out easily if you move it in the socket tightly. I thought everything is steel (again title is deceiving).Update :I had to eventually replace them after only few months of use. The plastic ball had worn out and couldn't hold the weight of the speaker which is within specs. I replaced them with BT-55 from avmountsonline and they are holding up well since last 2.5 years."
2,Difficult to install,"You'd think that these would be a snap to install, but the drywall screws were the cheap kind and don't hold well. One of my speakers is already pulling away from the wall. Also, the clamp that holds the rotating ball uses an allen wrench to tighten. The wrench provided is tiny and hard to hold onto, plus, while holding the speaker in one hand it's next to impossible to find the allen head which at this point is behind the speaker... You really need three hands or a helper to get these up right."
3,Worth a look....,"Although there is not a lot going for Sinatra in this western spoof, Jack Elam makes it worth a look. Elam was one of the all-time great character actors that can make even the worst spoof funny....case in point, Dirty Dingus Magee."
1,Unbelievably bad!,"I loved the book THE BALLAD OF DINGUS MAGEE, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. Great dialog, wild characters, hilariously funny. I was looking forward to seeing the movie based on it, until I heard who had been cast as the title character. FRANK SINATRA? Were they kidding? Had they even read the book? Out of morbid curiosity I watched the movie, and it was even worse than I could have imagined. NONE of the characters were much like they'd been in the book, and many had simply been omitted. Someone who had never read the book might get a few chuckles out of the movie, but it was dull, plodding, and hideously miscast. Really, it doesn't even deserve a one-star rating. I highly recommend the book, but the movie should be avoided like the plague it is."
5,FUNNY MOVIE,I've always enjoyed watching this film. Frank Sinatra and George kennedy are a hoot. I highly recommend this movie to all.
2,Boring and slow-moving,"What a complete dissapointment. I've been a fan of Frank Sinatra since I can remember and I've thoroughly enjoyed both his films and acting. Unfortunately, Dirty Dingus has got to be the worst thing he's ever done. Frank obviously didn't bother to see the final cut of the film. I thought Dirty Dingu was a complete waste of time and acting."
5,does the job!,Great product- we use it on the deck of the sailboat (when silly people who don't know any better walk on our boat with dirty or black soled shoes) or if bird droppings make a stain in the non-skid- also on the floor of our Boston Whaler- works like a charm!
4,"Works great, but a few complaints","As other reviewers have stated, this product really works. I have my boat parked in my driveway under a maple tree, and when leaves fall on the deck, they leave a stain, and this did a nice job of removing the stains.A couple of complaints though. First of all, when I received the product, it had leaked. They ship it in a plastic bag, but the bag leaked too, so the bottom of the box was wet with cleaner. Thinking the wetness was water, I set the box on my office desk and the chemicals damaged my desk. I have to wonder if this product really is biodegradable because it seems to be pretty caustic -- at least for my desk.When spraying off the cleaner it has a tendency to foam up. The foam prevents the water from draining down to the bilge. You have to spray for quite a bit to get rid of the foam and get the water completely out of the deck area.Despite the negatives, the product really works. My deck is looking bright and clean as new."
4,full of info,"If you have ever wanted to learn more about chameleons this is the book for you. It features several chameleons and follows then through out their day. We see their homes, we find out how they catch their prey and how they eat it. We also we how they react to one another. The authors note in the back of the book gives lots of factual information on chameleons.This truly delightful book gives a surprising amount of information. It would appeal to any age level, though its simple text is designed for a younger audience.Yes The full color photos of the chameleon are great!"
5,Best Interview Book For JMO's,"I read many books and attended too many seminars on job interviewing during my transition from the military. This book is by far the best. It is straight and to the point and tells you exactly what to do. Kreider covers every aspect of interviewing, as well as everything from resume writing to negotiating salary and signing the deal. The Handbook is well organized with chapters on each subject, so you can skip subjects not pertinent to you. All in all, this a great book and a must read for all military leaders transitioning to the civilian life. It is worth every penny."
4,Great Reference,The interviewing Handbook for Military Leaders is a must for anyone transitioning out of the military. Get your highlighter out and start reading.
4,"older handbook, good content","While this is certainly an older handbook, the content remains valid. I would read this on my way to job interviews (ha, on the plane, not while driving!), and it helped me put into perspective the way that I wanted to frame answers and talk about myself and my accomplishments. It also helped put some of my expectations into a a good frame of reference. While I won't say it was the reason that I got a job, it definitely did not hurt. Obviously, you have to take some of his suggestions with a grain of salt, as it was published before PCs were commonplace, but the actual content is great."
4,Good book on building team,Team building is very difficault. This book guide us on building a sucess team.
5,great support and width,One of the few decent looking running shoe/sneaker I can find that comes in a EE width. Very happy with it. Very comfortable and the size I ordered seemed true to size - no having to exchange for another size - which I really liked. I wear these for working out - walking - and they've worked out just fine. Thinking about buying a second pair - at least of this brand - to wear at work on casual days.
3,Size problem,I have a 4e wide foot. This product says it's wide and through the widest part it is. But at the toe area it reverts to a narrower size. I will not buy it again.
1,How do I get my money back?,"The title pretty much is the whole article. The article is about 4 paragraphs, and not worth 50 cents. What a rip-off."
5,A Must-Have!,"Every girl growing up in America should own this book. What a powerful message it sends about true beauty. With very little marketing, a re-printing of this book would be a goldmine (not to mention invaluable to our nation's future leaders and mothers)."
1,Very disappointed.,I tried half a dozen of the recipes and the drinks just don't taste right. I also had a bad aftertaste on some.I'd rather drink MUCH less of the real stuff than drink more of this awful stuff.
1,The Author Reviewed His Own Book! And Gave It *****!,"Persnickety's bizarre statements in his review of his other book, Beyond Atkins, appears to indicate that Persnickety is Markham or possibly a close family member (OUR accomplishments).Then Persnickety reviews his own book here! And gives it five stars, of course!Does Amazon approve of this? I don't. Do you?"
5,Persnickety,"Finally a book on guilt-free cocktails. So far, I've tried 5 different Low Carb Cocktail recipes and all tasted fantastic!!! This is a handy and beautiful book that was well written! I wish you health, happiness and much success! This is truly a great book on low carb cocktails!"
5,A brief yet original and captivating story,"The Secret In The Attic is a deftly written fantasy novel recommended for preteens and young adults, about a girl who inherits a secret gift from her grandmother, opening the doorway to adventures. In the course of her journey she experiences personal growth and discovery, braves challenges of mettle and spirit, finds courage and learns the hard meaning of remorse. A brief yet original and captivating story."
4,Windy Wildwood:The Secret in the Attic,"I have just read Windy Wildwood:The Secret in the Attic. I really enjoyed the book. I thought the book was so real, I was in the attic with Windy. I love Windy, she is like me. Please let me know when the next book is out. Thank you. Allissa"
5,Best Book of the Summer,"I am a high school teacher, and I highly recommend this book for all ages. I was astounded by the descriptive scenes, fantastic character development, and astonishing content. This book is a delight for all ages, and I would consider this book as apart of classroom curriculum in the english department. I can hardly wait for the next book in the series to come out."
3,review,Backcountry ski oregon is a nice guide. The photos are not as good as the ones in oregon descents but it offers a few more routes. Some of the routes are part of ski areas. useful book
1,worst phone ever made,"do not go near this phone. the screen display disintegrates, the static is terrible, the answering machine records messages at an inaudible volume, and the touchpad wears out, causing incomplete dialing. probably the worst phone ever made."
5,Printer works great but one thing to check,We replaced an aging printer of the same model that has been under hard use for many years. We use the printer through the serial card connection. We could not get it to connect until we saw that a newer serial card is needed for the newest printers of this model although there is no model change apparently changes were made in the serial interface. This raised the cost of the replacement of course. Google to find the serial numbers and required newer card if you use the serial interface.Otherwise the printer is a workhorse and performs as expected.
5,Exceeded my expectations.,The printer look almost new and it came with parallel cable (lol) and box with extra ink. It was easy to find a USB cable at the local store.Gerald
3,OKI320Turbo,"Printer is OK, It is noisy, print quality is not great,mostly outdated compared to most deskjet and laser printers.Would not have purchased except this was the only printer that worked with my software and 3 part forms."
1,"Nightmare printer, avoid at all costs!","I have to use this printer at my work and I am counting the days for it to be replaced with ANYTHING else. This printer is a nightmare. It jams constantly, tearing off the sheets is a pain to do.I do not have one positive thing to say about this printer, if you need something like it, search elsewhere.Avoid this printer at ALL COSTS."
1,can't rate yet,I can not yet rate this item. The web site suggested ordering a usb cable to go with the printer so I ordered that. When I received the printer there was no usb port. So I ordered a different cable to go from the 25 pin port on the printer to the computer's usb port. I ordered this on May 17th and am still waiting for Amazon to ship it. They say that it may arrive around June 9- 18th. I think that this is quite the wait for a printer cable. I will rate this product when I can actually use it..
1,Form tear-off is a problem on newer printers,"The Okidata 320 Turbo works great except for the form tear-off. However, the main use for this printer is printing invoices. Without the form tear-off option, the printer is worthless for printing invoices. The form tear-off seems to have started failing at a high rate within the last couple of years. It usually lasts long enough so that the printer is out of warranty. Calling Okidata support and getting a straight answer about what is wrong is a exercise in futility. They assume that you can't figure out how to set it up. Your options are quite simple. Spend the money for a new 320 or buy an Epson."
5,a classic,"Charlie Sexton is a bit of an odd duck- guitar slinger prodigy to the stars with little previous indication that he was capable of an album like this. Haunting, sepia toned production by Dan Lanois alumni Malcolm Burns combined with superbly well arranged, well written tunes make this one those overlooked masterpieces. Reams of intricately woven guitars, mandolins, atmospheric washes and heartfelt singing make for a stirring experience."
5,Rediscovering Charlie!,"Charlie had my attention from the first time I saw him on an MTV new year's concert right after ""Pictures For Pleasure."" I unfortunately lost track of him after that. I recently came across that cassette (!) and rediscovered him. All this time,I never knew the Arc Angels existed. If I had, I would have moved myself straight to Austin! I didn't know what to expect when I found ""Under the Wishing Tree."" What I found was brilliant...Charlie's beautiful, mesmerizing voice, musical talent and raw emotion on such personal songs as ""Sunday Clothes"" ""Plain Bad Luck"" and ""Spanish Words"" has me captivated. I just want to listen to him over and over. It amazes me that more people have not discovered Charlie Sexton.I am eagerly awaiting his new work out in September."
5,The Kid Who Named Pluto,"This was a very interesting book. As a teacher and mother of a science teacher, I am always excited when I discover a great book that will engage my students and develop an interest in complex subjects - particularly science. This book does that!"
1,This is Crap,"First of all, the book is over 10 years old at this point. Second of all, it's based on industrial project management concepts from the 70's. Third, it accomplishes very little besides completely boring the reader for 170 pages. It dispenses useless advice such as ""make a budget,"" ""make a schedule,"" written in a stilted format apparently designed to numb the reader's brain. You will not refer back to this book as a reference at any point after reading, I promise you.If this book has sold well, I imagine it's because of the clever title and black cover. It's certainly not because of the contents. Try ""Project Management for Dummies"" instead--it's got a silly title, but has much more useful information inside. Or at least buy something sold more recently than this paperweight."
3,information is good,"lots of info about my 1980s jag, helped me a lot. very interesting reading about the history and life of jaguar cars"
5,Definitive XJ Guide,"If you are restoring or considering purchasing one of Jaguar's XJ series sedans - this is virtually required reading. The book, well illustrated and featuring all known derivitives of the cars (such as Daimlers and the limited production coupes), is probably the most well researched guide you can own. It identifies not only what's correct and authentic when it comes to appearance and options, but what the weak spots and possible faults are as well. Featuring what seems like 100's of color photos, which must have been shot specifically for this book, this one should be on the shelf of every Jaguar lover's library."
4,Excellent,"Wilson takes many obscure gems from his lengthy songwriting career and together with producer Don Was, treats them with gentleness, simplicity, and dignity. This album is also notable for the inclusion of an original 70s demo. Poignant."
2,As If He Stayed Too Long At The Fair....,"Like Mohamed Ali boxing Larry Holmes, Like an over-weight Babe Ruth playing out his twilight years or F. Scott Fitzgerald vainly attempting to recapture the magic of his early triumphs, Brian Wilson has stayed too long at the fair. Why revisit the past glory of such marvelous works like Caroline No, Warmth of the Sun or Til I Die? It's not as though these new interpitations offer any insight or new meaning to these wonderful old songs. Unfortunately, they're downright dreadful and so is Brian's voice. I wish I had kinder words for this awful, awful album. But, as bad as ""I Just Wasn't made For These Times"" is, at least Brian isn't touring the country with cousin Mike and company on the ""oldies circuit"", signing Surfin' Safari and 409."
2,"Oh, Brian!","I bought it, I received it, I listened to it and I cried. Not from delight or sweet nostalgia. Although the music demonstrates Brian Wilson's inestimable talent as a songwriter and lyricist, he should have let someone else sing it. Listening to this CD was nearly as wrenching as watching Brian's solo performance of ""Good Vibrations"" accompanying himself on the piano with no back up whatsoever on ""Saturday Night Live"" some 20 years ago. I love the Beach Boys - but Brian should bask in old glories. My recommendation - stick with the classic Beach Boys. ""I Guess I Just Wasn't Made for these Times"" it just too appropriate a title for this CD."
3,not bad,It was a lot better that two of the others I purchased and returned. I was surprised that Big Mountain did not have getter graphics though as I have gotten tees from them before and thet were great.
5,Excellent,"This is the only charm book you'll ever need. It's a very fast read, which is great, because you can read it, learn the techniques, and start applying them immediately.This is truly a must have."
5,A necessity for all in sales,"I've ready many sales books to improve my presentation skills and closing ratio but none have worked for me quite like this book. I found it realy easy to read and finished it in about 3 hours. After following the easy to use techniques and practising before my next appointment I found my clients were like putty in my hands. Now my job is more than a pleasure to do because after each sale I feel like I've got a new friend for life. Plus, getting referals is 10 times easier after applying the content of this great book. Even Dale Carnegie would be proud to read this. I will probably read it many more times this year."
2,The power of charm,Easy to read. Not much depth. But I find it useful to remind me the power of active listening and general communication skills. Would recommend it as a coffee table book.
2,Lightweight,"A light, cheesy, unsubstantial tour of the subject. From reading the author's list titles he seems to specialize in churning out formulaic self help books. A disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for the clueless bore."
4,"39 chapters, 2 pages each","When most communication books are bloated magazine articles, this one is a magazine article with all the throat clearing drained out. Yes, much of what they say is standard wisdom but we all need a refresher and for those just getting into this area, it is a great intro: you learn more by listening then talking(with tips on how to do just that); body language pointers(the flick---move your attnetion from one eye to the other to show attention); compliment a lot(but be specific). There is also a good chapter on telephone communication. A welcome addition to the literature."
5,EXCELLENT READ FOR EVERYBODY!!!,"I worked for the American Library Association and got my hands on an uncorrected proof 2 years ago. I'm not Bill Clinton, a great speaker, or a college grad (yet), but this book changed my life.... I already did 90% of the recommended ""charming"" tools in this book, and yes maybe it is common sense, but it made me aware of it. It made me aware of these things, so I did them more and ensured I didn't slip. I found myself infront of a USC counselor, explaining why I had a 2.3 GPA in highschool and I am happy to say I will grad a trojan summer of 08'. I found myself doing it more and landing more and more interviews, women, and people in everyday situations. Any negative review on this book is some who is more interested in the ""theory"" and not practical use of charm. This is not a deep book, but rather a book easy to use for anyone who wants to improve their communication skills."
5,Simple and Powerful,"An easy yet profound read. Every time an idea struck me as ""just common sense"" I caught myself by wondering why so few of us don't do it.I think it was Emerson who said that 'common sense is genius dressed in working clothes.' This book offers simple straighforward genius in a way that works."
2,It wasnt charming !,"Everything in the book is so basic, nothing new and not told in an interesting manner. Each point could have been stated in one sentence, making the entire book a few pages long, but that wouldnt have been a book. The delivery was actually boring.Dont bother."
4,Nice coverage of well known material,"If you have looked at other books on how to better relationships, you won't find anything new. But if you are looking for a brief and readable introduction to the topic or a good review, you will find The Power of Charm to be a nice addition to your library."
3,A good primer for some,This book does a good job of introducing the reader to the elements of civility and interpersonal skills.For those who are students of human behavior the book was a good reminder of the complexities of human interaction.The information presented is not new and not particularly minding blowing but it can be helpful to some.
4,Charm your way into enhanced relationships and power,"Charm your way into enhanced relationships and powerYou could read Brian Tracy's basic handbook on charm in about an hour and come away with several elementary, but applicable, communication techniques. Even better, you can put his techniques to use immediately. Charm is the glue that unites the contents of this basket of basic communication skills and scraps. While it's a little gimmicky, the idea of being charming sounds just lovely. Co-author Ron Arden, a former actor and director, adds some solidity with valuable anecdotes about creating a stage presence. While parts of the content will seem familiar to you if you've already read a few books on interpersonal communication, this manual offers novices a fast overview and a good look at the basics. We recommend this useful book as a way to become charming without going to charm school."
3,an ok read,"It gave me some solid but predictable advice, and the word charm was said so much i started to do that thing where if you repeat a word enough it starts to loose its meaning. I'm sick of the word charm now it annoys me a bit to type it. so yeah 3 out of five is fair"
4,Well worth the money,"The latest in Kerr's celtic-style fantasy saga centering on Rhoddry and Jill. The story of Rhoddry Maelwaed has kept me eager for the next book in the sequel to come out. The jumping between alternate timelines is not too bad once you get used to it, and Kerr tells the story very well. I like the part about the dragon, Arzosah, becoming an ally of Rhoddry because she believes he has power over her by knowing her true name. Only thing I miss about the later books in this series is the fact Nevyn is gone. Jill is a competent Master of Aether, but will never match Nevyn."
3,Pretty good for the casual user,"Hello folks its Vince the radioman. I have been a collector and a buff for many years , love to do compares . This radio is generally ok no major complaints . The tuner quality is good ( although you can only tune down to a 5kh increment). Much better quality than the G2000a. The sound is a bit brassy but clear. Its a good little travel radio and for the casual user its certainly worth the money .I would rate this better than its competitor the Sangean ATS 404 . It has a little bit of a better tuner , better at noise reduction and it has an external ant. jack which is always a plus . Not the best radio for DXers because of the 5kh increment but you can still get some fairly decent results . Grundigs construction quality leaves a bit to be desired ( be careful its delicate!!) but all in all not a bad little radio . If you get a sale buy it."
3,World Band????Radio,"Good FM, poor SW. Lots of Bleed over. Lose all memory stations when batt. replaced. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Many Shortcomings,"Looking just at the features, this is a good unit to get for a basic, portable AM/FM/SW receiver. It has a good digital tuner, decent reception, an external antenna option for pulling in weak signals, etc. However the design of the unit has several short comings.The biggest by far is that it uses up the batteries when turned off! Leave it on the shelf, and in a few weeks it'll be dead. To add insult to the injury, all the features that require memory (channels, alarms) are lost when the batteries die.The second is the construction is not very sturdy. The grill popped off of mine after a few months of regularly toting it around. And the telescoping antenna - like all - is a failure waiting to happen (and it did).I'm looking for a unit that has comparable features, but is more sturdy, has better power management, and non-volatile memory."
1,Grundig YB 300 Pe,"Not a good buy Very poor speaker, even for a small one. Adjacent channel and bleed over occurs frequently on FM and AM even from stations that are many miles away. Controls are somewhat confusing.Not one of Chinas better exports."
2,"Not as bad as some people say, but not as good either","This is a disappointing collection that could have waited a while longer to include Stross's better fiction. Instead, we're left with three great pieces (""A Colder War"", ""Antibodies"", ""Extracts from the Club Diary"") adrift in an ocean of mediocre prose and stories that range from the average (""Yellow Snow"", ""A Boy and His God"" -- funny story, this, but not much else) to the atrocious (""Big Brother Iron"").I still believe that Stross has potential, as evidenced by the better stories. Unfortunately, the rest of the collection fails to meet the same standards, not to mention that it's under-edited and poorly produced (quite a few typesetting errors, and too much text crammed into a single page to save on the page count)."
5,Hot new writer,"Original, wild, and never lets up in any of his stories. This is one writer to keep an eye on as I am sure he will set new marks in excellence !!"
1,Absolute tripe,"Ugh. Shallow rip-offs .... Overworked, academic, clumsy prose. Stilted dialogue. A few clever ideas here and there, but not enough to make up for the rest.Avoid this at all costs, it'll just make you sick."
5,the sickest games ever!!,i am a wakeboarder my self and this game rocks...could b more realistic..its veeery addicting funnest game ever could be more challenging and something it really needed was create a wakeboarder otherwise the game is perfect
5,Seasons End,"One thing I've always like about amazon is they come out with the dvd's quicker than the retailers do around my parts, so it makes it easy for me to stay up to date with the episodes.Spoilers!!!In this volume its immidiatly after they talk to tsunade about becoming hokage that she has to chose between that or helping orochimaru. In the end naruto's strength and determination to become hokage helps tsunade make the decision to become hokage rather than helping orochimaru and in turn destroy the leaf village. This volume has nothing but the huge fight between the Sannins, naruto, and kabuto. Naruto also learns his special attack the Rasengan which helps beat kabuto leaving the sannin to fight.In the end orochimaru is gone again and they all head backto the leaf village with the new hokage having the season come to a close."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I bought this top of the line sashimi knife after seeing the Kyocera product advertised on How It's Made on TV. This ceramic knife was advertised as being the hardest material, harder than steel itself, and won't chip, scratch or warp like steel and won't leave an odor on your food. Well, I was in for a surprise when I found that the knife is chipped when I got it. I have to say I am disappointed in this material and knife. I would rather spend the money on a real sashimi knife than go for this product line."
2,disappointing...,"I didn't realize this is just a slightly updated version of Kaleidoscope Eyes,which Derogatis published,and I purchased,in 1996.The book itself is great,but I wouldn't have bought it a second time if i'd known it had been the same book that was simply re-titled."
3,not as helpful as other dummies guides,"Although I enjoyed the usual snide tone of this dummies book, my major complaint is that it never gets beyond the dummy level. I read the whole book in one sitting -- now I'm hardly a computer genius and have only had Windows 2000 for a week, but I only learned THREE new tricks from this entire book! I never thought of myself as a computer jock, but this book had such basics that I began to feel like a true nerd. There are other major things I wanted to learn about windows 2000: why does it make my passwords look 3 times their normal size? Is that some kind of encoding thing? I'm sure there are other aspects to learn besides 3 ways to copy a folder or file. Unless you haven't spent any time at all with Windows (any edition), you probably won't learn all that much from this very basic book."
1,Very Unhelpful,"I typically like the *for dummies* books. But this one is very poorly written. most of its advice relates to seeing the system/network administrator. As a future Network Admin in training, the last thing I would want is everyone coming to me with little problems they could solve themselves every 5 seconds. On the same note, The book has little to no technical info. in it, and it seems very unhelpful even for a beginner.I would not recommend this book for anyone. its unhelpful and much too simple to be of any use."
1,Don't buy this garbage,"I purchased 3 of these heaters 2 months ago. I've only had to use them full time the past few weeks. All three have stopped working in the last week. One of them started putting out smoke before it quit working altogether. Only buy these if you don't need them to last very long, and if you'll be able to monitor them while they're on. They lasted just long enough to not be able to get a refund."
3,Great heater...it only lasted a year before it almost burned down my house,"I bought this heater in the fall of 2010. It had a made on 8/2010 sticker on the bottom. It worked very well. Always kept the room nice a warm. However, in November 2011 I started noticing a burning smell. Then power button (not the on off button) stopped working. Then today it just stopped working all together. I noticed on the bottom a burn mark and hole. I looked around the area where it was sitting and sure enough my carpet has burn marks on it now. I took the bottom plate off to find that the coating around the small wire connecting to the power button had burned off and the wire disconnected. The wire was lying on the bottom of the unit, hence the burn mark. This is why you should never leave these space heaters on unattended. So in summary, it works great until the it starts to melt down!"
1,Smells horrible and shuts itself off!,"This heater shuts itself off after just a few minutes, which is probably a good thing, and smells like something is burning. This order permeates the room and makes one afraid to use again. I was going to put it in my daughter's room but won't now. Be very careful when purchasing this item -- could be dangerous!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.,NONE OF THE SEEDS WE BOUGHT FROM THIS SELLER GERMINATED. THESE ARE PROBABLY EXPIRED SEEDS. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
3,Good Product?,This product came with fast shipping and a decent price. The seeds still haven't sprouted yet after 3 weeks though. So I guess I'm not sure what I think yet.
4,Cagney can dominate any film,"I just watched this film on good quality video tape. There is lot to recommend it. Cagney is small in size, but how he takes much taller Stephen McNally. You really believe he can lick any man! There is also a good story and great scenery. In this film the role of woman (Irene Papas)is very important from the point of the story. She causes much of the action. Cagney is at his best in good-bad roles. There is also Lee Van Cleef in a minor role.This film reminds me of The Tall Men, but it is not nearly as good film as this one."
2,not right size,"When I purchased this reamer, I also purchased 3 other adjustable reamers. This one was to work on 5/8"" bushings, to enlarge and smooth them for shaft fitment. This reamer is to be 19/32"" - 21/32"". That, in decimal measurement would be .59375 - .65625. At its MAX measurement this reamer only mics to .6125!! It didn't even touch the OD of my bushings, let alone ream them out to the necessary shaft size! I can't use this reamer! My other reamers for 3/8"", 3/4"", and 1-1/4"" all fit like they should; smaller than the bushing, and expanding to larger than the bushing. This seems to be a fine reamer, but it is not the right size as advertised in my opinion."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH ES8152,"This item is NOT for ES8152, as reported in other postings for this product. The outer foil will fit perfectly and the blades will work, but they will not ""snap"" into place. So if you take off the foil head for cleaning, the blades will fall out. You have to look very closely (with a magnifier) to see the difference between the blades. Strange thing is, Panasonic's own website takes you to this WES9006PC as a replacement foil & blade kit for ES8152, but on the product itself model 8152 is not listed. I suppose it would be cheaper than buying them seperately, but it is a huge hassle to clean the blades, or even empty out the head after shaving."
2,expensive.,I used this razor on my legs. the replacement guards and blades are too much money. I'll probably be looking into the NONO hair remover by seporia.
2,Changed Design Not as Good as Original,Take a look at the photo of the cutter. Panasonic changed the design so it's not made up from a series of individual cutting disks. Now it's just a piece of steel stamped with slots. I find the shave isn't nearly as good as with the original design.
1,cheap but can't use,"Your price is cheap but I can't use, because it is defective. I returned this one. Also I had same experience with WES9006PC when I bought at the end of 2007 with price of 45.98 from you - I couldn't use blade either. I attached the blade when I return new one to you a month ago. I hope you should get right one. I am not sure if I can get WES9006PC from you in the future. Anyway I have new one from other site with price of 54.98 and have no problem.Thanks,"
