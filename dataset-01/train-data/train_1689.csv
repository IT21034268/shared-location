1,A place in the sun,Dvd had a large defect I have nothing more to say DVDs could not watch all of the movie that's it
5,a birthday gift well done,I gave this dvd as a birthday gift for a girlfriend and she was happy as she could be.
4,Good,"The novel on which this movie is based--Theodore Dreiser's AMERICAN TRAGEDY--is better. But the movie is good. My main problem is that Montgomery Clift's character is so DOUR through the whole movie, I did not find it believable that a bubbly, wealthy, beautiful woman like Elizabeth Taylor's character would find him appealing! You'd think he would have to exhibit some charm and energy to attract her. But I guess she just likes depressive men. A worthwhile movie, nonetheless."
4,A Place In The Sun,"I believe that this movie was very interesting. The conflict between the lovers was intense. The storyline is basically about a man who is engaged, yet he falls in love with another woman. Ultimately, the new girl it beautiful and rich so the man contemplates murdering his fiance in order to be with the new woman. It is made in the 1950's and is somewhat depressing, but it is worth viewing."
3,This movie had a lot of emotion to it.,I thought that this movie had a lot of feeling and emotion. I had no idea that Alice was going to end up dead at the hands of George. So they did a good job of keeping the movie from being predictable. The scenes with George saying goodbye to Angela were somewhat on the dramatic side. The emotion was just flowing from the movie as they kissed their last kisses. I had no idea that George would be found guilty. He seemed so innocent on the stand. I would have believed him.
3,A Great Introduction to Montgomery Clift & Elizabeth Taylor,"I had never seen a movie with Montgomery Clift and had seen very few movies with Elizabeth Taylor when I saw ""A Place in the Sun"". What a striking pair! Clift reminds me quite a bit of Tom Cruise. Taylor was quite a beauty at 17. Shelly Winters is the other key cast member and she was good as well. The dilemma that Clift gets himself into is compelling, even though it would barely be seen as a problem today (see Kevin Federline and Britney Spears...). The movie is a lesson demonstrating the old adage that ""honesty is the best policy."""
3,English 104 Review,"I believe this movie is outdated for our time, but on the hand it portrays what most of our society is like. Doing the crime before thinking of the punishment. In this movie Montgomery Clifts role as a poor gentleman, who is caught between the poor but lovely finacee, Shelley Winters and the beautiful and rich Elizabeth Taylor. He has to make a decision which is to kill his finacee and be with Elizabeth or stay with the finacee. He then takes it upon his self to kill is finacee to try and be with Elizabeth, but the plan back fires and he gets caught and then gets charged with first degree murder, then subject to the electric chair. This movie is very entriguing and also entertaining. I give it three stars because for its time it had to be some what like a thriller, but compared to today it is old news."
1,Not what I expected...,"I found the lack of interesting photographs and monotonous prose to take away from the lore and fascination of Cleveland cemeteries. There is a wealth of information that is not presented. Trivial facts about those residents whom the author finds interesting, may fail to interest others. I wasn't interested in a written, walking tour. The point of walking tours is to discover for yourself what you find interesting."
5,Easy to read & precise; a companion to your Residency,"The subjects are covered in a direct, goal oriented manner. This book will tell you the precise facts and points needed to pass your ABIM exam. Best of all, is the way letters are printed, good size, good space, it won't tire you when you read it.It is not a textbook, but a rapid resource of review, needs to be complemented with other books on IM.Good set of questions similar in format to those on ABIM examCompared to others, this is # 1 for me!"
3,Well he did at least read the book,"Green approaches the Hobbit as serious literature and undertakes to apply archetypal analysis along with some of the tools of physcological criticism. Not much help for a casual reader, but if you have a background in literaty critical theory an interesting explanation of the symbolism of the work.Green analyses the 2nd edition text of the Hobbit without reference to its sequal, The Lord of the Rings. Those wanting more information about Hobbits or their world must look elsewhere. But if you already understand the plot and are seeking to probe more deeply within the context of modern literary theories, this book may well form a part (though not an overly large one) of that journey."
1,difficult to follow this book,"This book and two cassettes contain a lot of useful information, however it is paced EXTREMELY fast and contains little translation of the Dutch conversations it presents. It is impossible to listen to the tapes while driving and make any sense of it. You must read the book carefully and listen to the tapes a bit at a time...AT HOME!"
2,Rip Off,"There are hardly any sheets per roll. We used to buy lint rollers at Costco (different brand), which were great, but Costco hasn't had them in stock lately. This is a total rip off. We're returning them--buyer beware, Target will deduct their shipping cost and YOU will have to pay to ship them back."
4,Good product,"I like the product, I use it every day for my suits. It's a good product, easy to use. Arrived on time."
4,Not perfect but did what it claimed,"This works on most clothes, pillows, and sheets. I was able to use most of the sheet before ripping it off so you shouldn't have too much waste. This doesn't work too well on woolen or special fabrics too well though. For the price, this is definitely nice to have."
5,Horatio Alger on Hashish,"I think this review is excellent and I am passing it along.-----Stew Albert offers a riotous insider's tour of the inspired chaos that was the Yippie movement in his thoroughly engaging memoir, Who the Hell is Stew Albert? His account of how an ""almost-nice Jewish boy"" from Brooklyn ended up getting beaten by cops in Chicago, hanging out with Timothy Leary and Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria, and juggling a friendship with both Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, reads like a Horatio Alger story on hashish. It also traces in fine detail the rise and fall of the great protest movements of the 1960s, including the Black Panthers and the Weathermen, in an analysis of politics and personalities that is both fond and somewhat rueful.Black Oak Books Newsletter"
2,"A phony and poseur inspired by ""Little Big Man""","In Thomas Berger's fine novel of the Old West ""Little Big Man"" the hero, Jack Crabb, goes everywhere and knows everybody, including being the sole white survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn. It's an excellent premise for a historical novel, and appears to have inspired Stew, whom I met when he was briefly in the Progressive Labor Party in San Francisco in the 1960s. The rest of his ""revolutionary"" adventures are imaginary. He's clever enough to have waited until most of the famous people he fantasizes about knowing are dead, and cannot refute his claims. If he were as good a writer as Berger we could forgive his fibs; unfortunately he's not."
3,Multi-Purpose,"Sitarist Ravi Shankar once wrote that he spent his first months of study on his instrument just practicing holding it, withour being permitted to touch the strings. I'd have used the same method of instruction on my few bassoon students over the years, if I could have gotten away with it. A properly held bassoon doesn't require the use of a seat strap, and using one as a student often leads to poor finger position.However, this Fox Bassoon Leather Seat Strap has multiple alternate uses, most of which have unfortunately been made illegal by meddling ""liberals."" My Swedish grandfather made frequent and effective pedagogical use of his seat strap when I sojourned with him, and I'm a better musician for it no doubt. Every time I hear a flat note, mine or anyone's, I remember the strap."
5,I love this seat strap and band,"I just received my seat strap today, 7 days after my initial order. I didn't notice from the picture but the band is adjustable so it can be made to custom fit the bassoon. The strap feels durable, well riveted and secure. I prefer to use a seat strap when playing bassoon because it takes the weight of the bassoon off of my body and the seat strap allows me to have the greats freedom of movement when I play. I don't like the bassoon harness because even though the weight of the bassoon is distributed over both shoulders, it is so restrictive in movement when I play and I feel it limits my ability to play with emotion. A neck strap does offer more freedom of movement than the harness but not as much as the seat strap and the weight of the bassoon using a neck strap slowly pulls my upper body down into an uncomfortable position."
5,Great songs,The songs were all that I wanted to hear from Andy Williams didn't want to miss out on hearing his voice even though he has died.
3,Moon River,"A reproduction of an old LP, I think. It is probably as goodor better than should be be expected. I liked it."
2,Nothing remarkable,"Tune + vocals in ""Just Drop Off"" and ""Another Way"" do a decent job of setting a mood. The rest of this CD is forgettable, a few songs are simply irritating. A great example of how many musicians like playing but really have no clue regarding how to put it all together. These guys need a better producer who knows ""what to leave in, what to leave out"" (to quote Bob Seger). It's not surprising you can buy this CD, used, for 1 cent (plus shipping) on Amazon right now. Not a bad work, just nothing particularly good."
2,Save your money,Where to start? Poor disjointed script? Home movie camera with feeble attempts to be artsy? Bad acting? Really bad acting! Directing non-existent? Sound quality equal to a highend cell phone. They should have saved the publicity money and spent it on production.
1,"Nice try, but...","Solid premise, terrible execution. I'm SO weary of the faux cinema-verité approach used by so many directors now: jerky hand-held cameras have become a cliché. In this case, it adds nothing and accomplishes little more than producing a feeling of needing to run to the drugstore and find some Dramamine. The intercut flashbacks are disruptive to any continuity and are often confusing and disorienting. The audio is spotty and the lame attempts at southern accents are really grating -- especially when delivering such poorly written lines. All a shame because in other hands this could have been a very meaningful project."
4,poster boy,This is not a bad movie because it makes sense in the real world. It is enjoyable to follow the story line in the real world without the usual boring bar scenes or the old gay dialog.
4,"Solid story line, with significant current implications","This is a nicely done story that could easily be about major U.S. politicians of today. While most of the acting is monolithic, Matt Newton presents a gut-wrenching emotional scene that ""made"" the film for me, while Karen Allen supports the entire film with a character having many facets and plenty of depth. Michael Lerner's character is easily hated, and rightly so, for a stunning portrayal of a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do, belligerent, self-absorbed politician."
5,McKennitt's best!,I love this CD! McKennitt blends her celtic music knowledge with a beautiful voice and new technology to create an absolutely amazing recording. I listen to it all the time.
3,"pleasant, not","I loved 'book of secrets' so much that I really was expecting more of the same and was sadly disappointed. I played it for a month or so and then it went back in the jewel case, haven't touched it since. It just didn't live up to my expectations.I want music that fills me with happy thoughts, with cheerful thoughts, with some kind of pleasant emotion. I found this selection to be ho-hum and not uplifting."
1,Nauseating music makes my intestines bleed.,"Theres just nothing like coming home to do some work and hearing the sound of annoying irish music eminating from my roomates stereo. This music truly makes me sick to my stomach. There is just something in McKennett's voice that seems to cause nausea, and possibly intestinal bleeding. I urge anyone who considers buying this to spend the next 2-3 months locked in a room with something by a real musicial in the stereo."
5,"Celtic vocals are good, but Marrakesh Night Market is great","I've noticed the doumbek in the background of a number of McKennitt's strongly celtic albums before, which is odd as it is more of a middle-eastern or arabic instrument. In this album, she allowed one song in particular be quite different then her usual -- the arabic influenced ""Marrakesh Night Market"". I feel it is worth the price of the whole album itself."
4,Solid mist,"I enjoyed this album immensely, not least because I recognised songs in different ways. For example, the fairytale used for inspiration in 'Bonny Swans' is known to me through a retelling by Patricia C. Wrede. The first track is actually the theme song for 'Mists of Avalon' and is one of the best on the album, with a misty, mystical feel to it. 'Marrakesh Night Market' is another nice one. The Spanish influence is evident in several of the tracks. McKennit's tunes, lyrics and voice combine to make this a pleasure to listen to."
5,Accoustically pleasing,Her best work to date. It adds flavor to music like spice to food particularly the variety of sounds which are real ear pleasers. It's an intriguing piece of music.
3,"Enjoyable, but a bit too ""foreign"" for me","This is the first (and only, so far) Loreena McKennit album I have purchased. While ""Dark Night Of The Soul"" is one of the most beautiful things I have heard in a long time, I must say that I wish more of the songs were in that sort of style. The heavily Middle-Eastern influences in the rest of the album turned me off. I find myself using the programming feature of my CD player with this album, skipping over tracks. Still, this album is more interesting than most output from other current artists."
5,What a voice!,"This album was my introduction to Loreena McKennitt. I could not believe that I had not previously heard such hauntingly beautiful music. Listening to this during a session with my massage therapist prompted me to buy this album and also ""The Book of Secrets"". I just love them both--they are so relaxing and should be a must for anyone who enjoys Celtic folk music."
4,Haunting and exotic,"Is it New Age? Is it World or Pop music? Is it Celtic? Heck, all I know is that it's beautiful, it's relaxing, and it can pull at your emotions differently each time you listen to it. Granted, I don't feel this is her strongest effort but we're all missing the point if we are comparing one CD to the next. They all have their strengths and weaknesses while she tries one thing after another in her travels. You have to also read the CD jacket to fully appreciate what she is trying to convey with each song. In this CD, my favorite has to be The Dark Night of the Soul. This song can be about prayer or about two lovers. With that haunting voice of hers and her unique blend of literature, travel, and ancient lore in all of her works, Ms McKennit can carry you along and make you forget the hurts and tensions of the day. She is an amazing lady. Appreciate this CD as just another exploration of her passions and insight into her soul. I have all of her CDs and I value them all equally."
4,Becoming more and more of a fan,"I have McKennitt's most widely-known CD, ""Book of Secrets"", and always enjoyed it. I purchased this one, ""the mask and the mirror"", after watching the recent TNT presentation of ""The Mists of Avalon"". The TV series was disappointing (it's my favorite book, and it's fantastic, and they changed the story too much), but the music was wonderful-- and it was Loreena McKennitt, the first track off this CD, ""The Mystic's Dream"".The whole CD is terrific, and I'm becoming a more serious fan of McKennitt in general. Looking forward to hearing more of her work."
4,For the Celt in you,"We have had this CD for several years now, and it never seems to become ""old."" We will listen to it for a calming effect during the day and especially while going to sleep. What I personally favor is the Celtic sound / Celtic draw that this music brings. It makes me feel the pull of those European Isles -- great for mood setting!My only complaint is that as good as this is, I've heard her do better... Book of Secrets, for example. All-in-all, I like it and so will any Loreen McKennitt fan!"
5,The mask and the Mirror,"This whole album is fantastic, I feel like I have entered another relm whem I listen to Loreena's music."
5,exotic,"this album will have you tasting the cinnamon and spices of India and Egypt, feeling the heat of the sands"
3,good but different,"I bought The Book of Secrets first and really enjoyed it. Aftwards, I bought the Mask and the Mirror and listened to the first 4 of 8 tracks. It is still a great album however I was expecting something similar to The Book of Secrets. As a result, I was a bit disappointed as her style is different (more upbeat rather than somber) with this album. It is still a good CD to have but my favorite remains The Book of Secrets."
5,Magical!,"Nothing less than magical...taking you to a different era, this music is very spiritual, moving and perfect! No doubt you've heard this music in great's such as ""The Mists of Avalon""! It sends chills all over everytime I listen - a MUST for New Age lovers!"
4,Almost but not quite....,"Very nice, but ""Book Of Secrets"" is much better. The over all style is the same but I like the songs better on ""secrets"". Still I listen to this cd quite alot."
5,A Real Gem,"If you like music that paints a lush soundscape, you will love this CD. Unlike Enya, Loreena McKennitt is also a very good story teller. This is my favorite release of her's. The first 4 tracks are all magnificent. The last 4 aren't quite as strong, however, by then it is much too late to walk away from this gem."
2,Inadequate directions!,"This robot has 900 parts, and the directions are provided in diagrammatic format only (ie, no words). Moreover, the illustrations are small, and so it is very difficult to identify the parts and figure out which screw (the 3/4 inch, the half inch?) goes into which hole (there are many tiny holes). My very patient 8-year-old grandson and I spent more than 4 hours working diligently, and we accomplished the first seven steps of the 56 steps required to assemble the robot. He learned what ""consultative services"" means when I said we needed more help! If the parts were labeled and the directions provided in words, this would not be such a dauting task."
2,no,"It was recommended by Robert Sawyer who I respect, however, the plot was so predictable I put it down after Chapter 3."
4,"A cracking good yarn, but watch for language & violence","I just finished reading this book to my 7-year-old son and we both loved it. I'm a fan of Terry Jones from his Monty Python days, and was delighted to find his irreverent, offbeat humor intact throughout this fast-paced adventure. Having said that, I must caution parents on the appropriateness of some of this material for the pre-10 age group. If you read it to your child, be prepared to occasionally edit for language and subject matter. Also, as the action occurs in locales throughout France, you may wish to brush up on your French pronunciations!"
5,READ IT!!,"Read the Knight and the Squire first, then read this installment. They are wonderful -- exciting storytelling, humor and excellent medieval research behind them. Terry Jones is a gifted story teller. We found the Knight and His Squire on a trip to London several years ago and loved it so much that we ordered this book as soon as it came out in England thry Amazon UK. It was well worth the extra shipping expense. We cannot wait for the next book in the series. By the way, the novels have excellent male AND female leading characters, and are witty enough to interest adults as well. Go for it!"
3,birthday,This was a Birthday gift also. We had a old school basement party. I remember when a dad use to play these songs
4,King of Italo Disco,"Miko Mission: probably one the King's of Italo Disco of the 80's. This collection of his hits is a must for any person who enjoys italo NRG. All songs are extended and there are even some updated remixes of huge dance hits like, ""How Old are You?"", ""The World is You"", and ""Two for Love"". I prefer the original versions, though. As good as the remixes are (and they are good), I like the sound of the 80's best."
4,a must have,"This is the most informational book I have read on the disease of Hepatitis C. It goes through the different stages, treatments, alternative medicines. It also helps you understand what tp expect as the disease progresses. A must have for anyone battling this horrible illness."
4,For the nostalgic flyer or an Airliners library!,"Who doesn't miss the ""innocent days"" of commercial airline travel? If you are even remotely interested in commercial flight, remember the days before the metal detectors, the Boeing 707 or simply enjoy a well designed book about fashion, food, design and airlines, this book is for you. I bought this book without hesitation and am 100% satisfied!"
3,A Disappointment to this Fan of Classic Airliners,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book. I was expecting a historical book on the evolution of airliner design and culture. What I got was a very pretty, well designed book with little substance. The trivial text is written as if for a kid in junior high school. There is just no depth to Lovegrove's discussion of the evolution of airline design. I was certainly expecting some details of what it was like flying from Britain in India back in the 1930's or crossing the Atlantic on a Stratocruiser. Many of the photos are slick promotional shots used by the airlines as marketing tools. They are interesting but I wanted more HISTORICAL photos of actual cabin interiors. Nonetheless, Lovegrove did include enough enticing photos to justify giving the book three stars. However, I cannot recommend it to a serious student of classic airliner lore. There is just very little substance to warrant spending 20 bucks on this book."
4,4 Funny Women,"I really bought this for my 90 yr. old mom she thinks they are hilarious.They were ahead of there time great episodes on these discs, I LOVE them as well. Good price and fast delivery."
5,This Show Is Amazing...,"I really have enjoyed this show over the years. Not only to I love and enjoy the acting and humor of the show, I'm so impressed with the great public works that these ladies have done over the years, especially with the GLBT community. Great job, Estelle!Again, if you want a wonderful show with some outstanding wit, get this!!! It's uncut and you can watch it anytime!"
5,The Golden Girls Rule!!!!!!!!!,"After reading other reviews i see that i'm not the only Golden Girls freak! I, like many others have been waiting a looooong time for this DVD to be released. (Gee, now if we could only see Mary Tyler Moore season two come to fruition). What a wonderful Christmas gift this would be for a friend who loves The Golden Girls or as a present for yourself! This show is is an all time classic, winning Emmys for each Golden Girl and best comedy! Shows of this caliber don't come along that often. Golden Girls fans REJOICE!!!!! *******And the new gets better!!! I just read on the Ultimate Disney website that SEASON TWO of The Golden Girls is to be released in the spring of 2005!!!!!*******"
5,FINALLY....my life is complete!,"I have been waiting and wishing and hoping for the release of this tv series on dvd! I often joked that I would do anything to have every episode on dvd (stopping just shy of selling my soul to the devil himself...don't worry I wouldn't do that). Atleast now the first season is being released. Hopefully, all the seasons will eventually be available for purchase on dvd (and soon)! The studio would make a killing, since the demand for this product is soooo great. I don't know anyone (female OR male) that doesn't love this show. I have seen every episode many times and it is still undeniably hilarious. The writers for this show really knew their stuff and the cast is phenomenal. In a man's world lets let these women have their time to shine! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for releasing this series on dvd. That just makes me SOOOOOO HAPPY! I have been dying for this."
5,About time,"Thank God almighty that The Golden Girls are finally on DVD. The best show is television is finally coming and I can't wait, I'm so excitied."
3,Information for Australian buyers,"I have always loved this show and looked forward to the arrival of the 1st series.The show as usual is great, no complaints there.For any australian or NZ buyers this DVD has problems playing on our machines. Previously I have brought many Region 1 DVD's from Amazon and all have worked, but for some reason this DVD played in one of my machines, but not the other, and they are both multi-zone. Had the same problem with the Unsolved Mysteries box set, however every single Sex and the city dvd was fine!!! Not sure why...but just a warning for buyers."
4,LOVE IT!,I love these ladies! They are hilarious! That Rose...man she's awesome! All of them! The whole show is worth buying and watching!
5,Still Funny,I am so glad this is available on dvd. I have been watching this show most of my life and it is still fun after all these years.
5,for my daughter,My daughter loves this show. This was the first season and since then we now own them all. My daughter watches this show and laughs every time.
4,One of the best shows ever,"I love Golden Girls - it reminds me of watching it with my grandma back in the late 80s and early 90s. In fact, I just finished watching the first season again today. I think this show did a lot to break down the stereotypes about middle age and elderly people. I know I always wanted to grow up and be like the Golden Girls - live with my best girlfriends and stay up all night eating cheesecake whilst reminiscing.The only complaint about the first season DVD set I have is that there's only one special feature and it's Melissa and Joan Rivers. I would have loved to have more behind the scenes stuff or even a gag reel (if they kept that kind of stuff back then)."
4,They're Back!!!!!!!,"The girls are back and it's about time!!! The Golden Girls was one of the best sitcoms of the 80s and this collection is a great walk down memory lane. This is a must have for the die-hard Golden Girl Fan, or even the occasional viewer. The special features are a bit of a disappointment, but all and all a great collection. I look forward to the second season!!!!!"
5,More! More! More!,"Absotively Posilutely Fantabulous! Even the clarity, color and sound is better than ever. All I want to know is when can we get more. One season is like an appetizer without dinner!!!"
5,I can't believe they're finally on DVD!!!,"I'm sooooooooooo happy...I rushed out to Best Buy during my lunch hour and purchased this set. As soon as I got home, I put it in the DVD player and enjoyed seeing the original, uncut episodes of this seminal TV series. I watch it on Lifetime; I didn't realize how much they edited the show until I viewed the DVD!The show is wonderfully crisp and clear, the intro and end credits are intact, and, best of all - NO COMMERCIALS to interrupt my laughter. LOL!It was wonderful to go back to when I was a kid watching this show with my mom nearly 20 years ago. It brought back many terrific memories. I can't wait for the rest of the series!"
5,Golden Girls,This disc set is the beginning to an awesome and amazing series! I can't wait to own all seven disc sets!
1,"Wonderful Series, DVDs really bad quality","I love the Golden Girls, and the first season is laugh-'til-you-cry funny. However, the quality of the DVDs themselves is very poor. The image is terrible. It was so fuzzy on my LCD screen that it hurt my eyes. And when the characters moved rapidly, there was a bunch of horizontal lines, and sometimes columns and things that should be vertical, looked curved in the middle. While the source material is not done on the best quality tape, there is still no reason the images on this DVD should be so bad that vertical images are deformed. I know this has nothing to do with my player, as other things look just fine. Gettting on video (if it exists might be a better option) or waiting until they come out with a better edition."
3,Finally!,We've been waiting for this DVD-series so long. We have lots of episodes on VHS and some of 'm I can dream. Can't wait till november..... Sylvia from the Netherlands
4,I'm a golden girl now,"Back when this was on tv, I was in my 40's and watched this grudgingly. Not sure what made me get this set, but I did, and 3 episodes in I'm enjoying it and reflecting back to the eighties."
3,Defective DVD,The series is good of course. The third DVD doesn't play good at all. It 'hangs up' so you are sitting there watching it and waiting for the citcom to continue. Not happy at all about that!
2,A Not So Good Picture,"My mon is a big fan of The Golden Girls, so the DVD was a Christmas gift to her. She just told me a few days ago that when she's watching the DVD the picture changes colors from light to dark all on its own. So that would be my complaint on that."
3,Where's the Special Features?!,"Hello Everyone! You might be surprised that I am only giving this 3 stars but I'm not talking about the show, only this DVD.If all the product details are accurate and up to date, then I have to say that I am very dissapointed and that this DVD is not doing the show justice. It's taken almost 20 years for this show to be officially released and all that is offered for extras is commentary on the fashions by Joan and Melissa Rivers. Who Cares!! I didn't like them on E! Why put them on this DVD?!What should be put on the DVD is interviews by the cast and crew that were done in the past as well as recently. There should be rehearsal footage and bloopers. There should be a tour of the set and as an extra added bonus, a compilation of Rose's St. Olaf stories.At this point, to me the only good thing about this DVD is that you get to watch the shows without commercials and hopefully without any edits."
5,Senior is SOOOOO excited!,"I can't believe it!! I have been waiting for this for 5 years! Me and my friend Jr couldn't be happier! Thank you, thank you! Miami here we come!!! SR"
5,Oh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally,I love the Golden Girls from deep down in my heart. All of them...from the cocky self conceeded Sophia Portrillo...to adorable Dorothy...to stupid funny Rose...to trampy Blanche. They are so lovable! And finally! On DVD! Thank you!
4,Golden Girls Season 1,It is a good dvd . I enjoy a lot of the episodes . There are only a few that I don't care for .
5,Your an Idiot if you don't love this show!,"Don't waste time reading reviews, and BUY THIS SET! The Golden Girls is by far the GREATEST invention when it comes to Television. It's more than a television show! It's Realistic, and it's like they are a real family. RIP Bea, Rue, & Estelle. I Love you all ! And, Betty.. I hope you live to be 110 or greater."
5,Sound Problems within set,"I believe there are sound problems with the DVD sets. Several episodes start off with really low volume during the opening credits. The sound/music starts to increase in volume til it is back to normal by the end of the opening sequence. The dialog and soundtrack is otherwise normal. I have noticed this on about 10 episodes on all 3 discs. I know it is not my player, as I have gotten the same result on other players. Is anyone having similar problems?"
3,"Not the best GG season, but it's classic","I lvoe the Golden Girls so this is a view from a fan. I remember so many better episodes than the ones in the first season, though. And whatever happened to that gay guy who cooked for them until Sophia moved in? They never even explain where he went or why.There are no extras on this disc. No Rue, Betty, or Bea interviews, but hopefully later seasons will have those. The only real extra is Joan & Melissa Rivers on GG fashion and that's nothing special.I still say buy this if you're a fan. It's a very important season for setting up the characters."
5,Waiting for this day to come!,"And its finally here! The season that started the seven year masterpiece full of sex, wit, and of course, cheesecake! I hope they will release the other six seasons as well, and soon! I can't wait!"
4,I bought TWO copies,"One for me and one for a friend. You could easily make the case that Stan Smith is one of the unluckiest guys around. He witnesses a mob hit which forces him into the witness protection plan with a beautiful woman whose responsibility is to protect him by posing as his wife. She just happens to be a lesbian. They wait for the murder trial (in which Stan is to testify) in a tiny town in Utah where all the men have multiple wives. So Stan gets married and he's still sleeping alone! Poor Stan. Everybody's after him for all the wrong reasons. ""Isn't That Bigamy"" is simply a quick, fun read."
5,Low Sodium Foods recipes,A good guide for low sodium foods and some good hints and recipes. Good information for people new to a low sodium diet.
4,Diets,"If your Doctor tells you that you need to cut out salt, this is a way to see and try and follow his instructions. I found it a little confusing at first. But I knew I had to cut out my salt intake. I was what you would call a saltaholic. But I have cut back."
1,"very, very, very bad from the moment I ordered it.","I have always had good service when ordering books from Amazon but this time it was very, very bad. They sent a CD instead of a paperback book and after I PAID for the return of the CD, they did NOT reimburse me for it and NEVER received a book. I ordered the book on December 7th and still did not have the book this week. Very very disgusted with the company."
2,Not much use unless you eat a lot of fast food,"Should have paid more attention to this purchase. ""Low Salt Favorites"" by the same author is an excellent cookbook full of useful information about low-sodium diets. Covering sodium content in restaurant food is probably an impossible job unless you limit the scope to chain eateries. But that limit means it's of little use to me personally."
1,To General,"The book in trying to cover the country made it to general, with the majority out of our area, and proably yours."
4,feedback,"I like the ease of use of the book for shopping/eating out. However, sure do wish the ""regular"" grocery stores carried more products."
5,Dealing with Congestive Heart Failure,This book was extremely helpful in determining what foods my father was able to consume.It was easy to follow and very dense with information. I was very pleased with this purchase.
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!,"I have the original clocks tape. I downloaded this black box version thinking I was getting the old tracks remixed and perhaps some new songs. The new songs were ok ,sort of ,but the real, first album ,tracks were much better, with more energy and better b side songs ,that are not on this reissue . overall don't waste your time with this and raise hell with the record company type's to release the original recordings."
3,A Spectacular Journey Through Grief,"""The Light of Stars"" brings a comforting awareness to the grief process. This book is an excellent reference for any adult who is leading a child through a period of grief or death. Through its colorful pictures and moving conversation between the little girl and dog, a person becomes touched by the greater reality of life and death in the world around us. The story will not only touch the youth but will also help the child in every adult, because in times of grieving we all become young at heart."
2,still too small,"ordered a size larger than I would usualy wear, after reading the last review, and it still doesn't fit. I want to send it back but then I will have to pay for shipping and they say that you need to put insurance on it if you are sending it back :("
5,"This book saved me $10,000 in a week","What a fantastic book. Even though many of the ideas are so simple we often forget about them. One of these simple ideas I applied to my business and I ended up saving myself just over $10,000 and all it took was three hours, a few telephone calls and a couple of short meetings. I'm busy working my way through all the other ideas - I've even given some of my staff certain chapters to read and see how they can apply it to our business."
5,Has nothing to do with Ecuador.,"This book should not be listed under Ecuador (i.e., the Republic of Ecuador). It is a treatise in/on nuclear physics."
2,A tough slog that's more about quarks than jaguars,"I picked this up because I thought it was going to have some information about Ecuador (the Jaguar section) in it. It does--about one whole pages worth. The rest of the pages concern Gell-Mann's ideas on the inter-connectedness of things. Gell-Mann, for those of you who don't buy the Nobel prize-winning scientist collector cards, was the identifier of the Quark, that object that is smaller than what had previously been thought of as the smallest element (electrons are made up of a collection of quarks). This book is interesting but rough slogging at times as Gell-Mann tries to give you an instant understanding of the last ten years of modern physics. This should appeal to fans of Richard Feynman and Douglas Hofstadter, although the style isn't as smooth as either of them."
4,The basics of information theory as relating to the science of emergent order is clearly presented,"This book gives valuable information on how complex systems arise out of a simple, natural ground. Gell-Mann's theories are useful in understanding chaos theory as well as many branches of quantum physics. A description of Gell-Mann's ecological explorations and efforts to maintain the biosphere is also given. The magician and student of physics will be well rewarded for reading Gell-Mann's work. The processes of consciousness and so magical phenomena may be understood in this light."
4,The Quark and the Jaguar,"We ordinary mortals can't really understand quantum mechanics, but this book gives us a bit more insight!"
3,Too tedious to finish,"Mr. Gell-Mann won a Nobel Prize for his work in physics, but he will never will a Pulitzer for his writing. It's too tedious to endure.I love reading books about physics. I tried to read this book -- twice. I wanted to like it. But both times, I got no more than a third of the way through, and couldn't force myself to read another word.Mr. Gell-Mann's writing is too convoluted and dry, his theories so superficially presented. Unless you're a speed reader, I'd imagine there are very few people who would ever waste the time required to force themselves through this very disappointing book."
2,"A disappointingly dull, and lackluster work.","Gell-Mann writes that this is his first and only book -- and that he came to write it to express to a wider audience his ruminations on ""complex adaptive systems"" (a phrase he seems happy to repeat again and again ...) and their relation to the fundamental world of physics. In this he fails, for his main points (which he has a hard time presenting concisely) are -- quite frankly -- rather obvious. (In this dismissal of his ideas I might well be mistaken; there may indeed be a treasure trove of ideas here. But if there is treasure to be found, it is buried well).What this book does offer is a concise summary of the complex world of particle physics which Gell-Mann helped to discover. This summary, taking up only a few short chapters near the middle of the book, is excellent. If Gell-Mann had maintained this level of precision throughout the book, it would have helped immeasurably."
1,Big and tall my azz,13-15 in the land of tiny narrow feet people. Length might be good for a 13 but if you cannot get them on doesn't make a difference. Next Olympic event will be a team of three trying to get these socks on someones size 15.
5,Excellent!,"Perfect for expecting Parents. This is the first product I found that covers the whole childbirth class, baby care, mom care, and breast/bottle feeding. All in eight lessons. You can read the text, watch the video, listen to the doctor, or learn from the nurse. The dictionary is very helpful, and an interactive self-assessment summarizes each lesson. It was perfect for us!"
5,Unbelievable software,"I just found out that I need to be in bed for the rest of my pregnancy. I am due in six weeks. I was therefore looking for a childbirth class I could take from home. I found the Childbirth software, and I thought it would begreat to be in bed with my laptop. This software seems able to provide information about any problem you have concerning childbirth, the post partum period, and baby feeding. They even provided birth announcements you can design yourself. I love it!"
1,No customer service - very disappointed,"My copy of this CD, which I purchased through Amazon.com, did not come with a serial number. Therefore, when I attempted to use the CD, I couldn't. I left several voicemail messages and sent a number of e-mails to modus 5, but to no avail. My baby is due in about a month, and I still am not able to use this CD because I don't have a serial number, and I have not heard back from Julie Lyss (or anyone else) at modus 5 despite my numerous attempts to contact her. I am very disappointed and feel that I have wasted my money with this product. I wish I could get a refund. Better yet, it would be nice to get a serial number so that I could utilize the CD."
3,not bad,"Alot of great info. However, when I got in the delivery room I only used the techniques I learned from the Laugh and Learn Lamaze DVD."
5,Barbra Streisand: Color me Barbra,I collected all of Barbra's albums on tape and it's a new experience and a joy to do it all over again on the perfection of CD! I love it!
3,Mission Canyon,"After all the hype from Stephen King about this author, I really was looking forward to reading this book which I paid dearly for. I was disappointed. Although it did hold my interest, it didn't strike me as one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Plus, I'm getting a bit tired of the constant tug-a-war between the heroine, Evan, and her wheelchair bound lover. Get married or move on..."
3,Not great,"This sophomore effort from Meg Gardiner was just that - sophomoric. It starts off pretty strong, but runs out of fire. And some aspects of Evan's character make me want to punch her in the face. Wouldn't you want to kick a person who escapes the ever-present bad guys by sliding down the drain pipe, while holding a baby? It was painful to read that whole chapter, where in page after excruciating page Evan holds a sleeping baby and creeps along the attic of the church to escape the bad guys. And then at the end... her phone rings!"
1,premise makes the book almost unreadable,I read my first book by her then picked up this one. The main tension is based on the guy who ran over her boyfriend being back. She explains there is a felony warrant because an anonymous caller said someone did it. The idea that a case could be built and a felony warrant issued over what (since the caller stays ANOYMOUS) are ZERO witnesses and no evidence is so ludicrous it's hard to pay attention to the rest of the silliness. I'm going to skim through and try another and hope this is a fluke. I will suspend belief with the best of them but the book has to make SOME sort of sense
4,"Cleverly done and entertaining, if totally implausible","OK, the plot is about as believable as your average Bruce Willis or Kurt Russell action/adventure/thriller, but this was fun to watch. Clive Owen is great in the lead role, Jennifer Aniston is completely believable in her supporting role of girl next door gone bad, Vincent Cassell is uniquely evil in his portrayal of the villain and the supporting cast give outstanding performances all around. I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because it was completely engaging and it had a happy ending for the good guy. The ridiculousness of the plot, though only a minor distraction from the flick's entertainment value, keeps it from getting a higher rating from me."
3,What you get for cheating...,"I hadn't heard much about this movie and I had no idea what to expect when I watched it. Jennifer Anniston, who I am not into, looked a bit better than usual in this particular movie. This is really the first time I've seen her play a ""big girl"" role. She's not quite leading-lady material, but she holds her own.The story/plot is taken directly from police file stories of real scams run on unsuspecting men and women. It is interesting to see it played out on-screen, especially since I wasn't expecting it. I really though Anniston's character was into Clive Owen's character.This is a decent movie. There is nothing too memorable about it, but it is worth seeing once."
3,lame,For those who have seen the movie. The con artist Jennifer Aniston in the movie does the same scheme over and over in the same city and in the same motel building. Ok. How smart is that. Even the stupidest con artist wouldn't do that. This is what really ruined the movie. But u like a cliched standard over the top twisted thriller which happens to be rated R than go see this.
3,A Decent Little Thriller,"Clive Owen stars as a family man who gets his life turnt upside down when he meets a business-women (Jennifer Aniston) on the train. They decide to get together eventhough they both have families. Before they can have sex, a man (Vincent Cassel) busts in the motel room, robs them and rapes her. Things don't end there though because the man starts calling Owen and making threats to tell his wife on him unless he gets more money. After Owen gives him some, he calls wanting more and more and Owen has to figure out how to get him out of his life.The trailers make it look like the movie is all about Owen and Aniston trying to get this bad man out of their lives but this is mostly Owen's movie and Cassel's. Vincent Cassel is great as the kind of slimy villian you love to hate. Aniston is basically just a side-character that doesn't have that much to do. Owen is excellent but the material isn't really worthy of his ability."
3,Derailed,"This movie was entertaining, I generally like Clive Owen as well as Vincent Cassel, (especially in earlier work) although I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan, and had low expectation with regard to her role in this film, to my surprise she did OK. I would guess that most folks would not see the surprising plot twist coming but I guess I have seenthis type of plot twist before and it did not fool me. The violence thatsomeone else complained about is somewhat necessary. There is a few minor holesin the story line but it is still entertaining."
4,Clever...,"Good movie. Good acting. Although after seeing it you realize that its a pretty typical plot, while watching it, it seems pretty interesting.So movie is about a man (Charles) who starts to get involved with a woman (Lucinda) he met on a train. One night while they are at a motel, a man comes in, robs Charles and rapes Lucinda. After that incident, the rapist begins to contact Charles and ask him for money. Charles is desperate and tries to find help. Towards the end, he realizes that Lucinda is not what she seems and he goes out to get revenge.Good acting by Owen and Aniston. A plot that keeps you thinking that you know whats going on when in reality you get a shock at the end.The only thing i didnt like was that when you think the movie ends, it doesnt. It keeps going for yet another encounter.However, overall its a good movie. Recommended."
2,A hair better than CLOSER,"Why does Clive Owen make these stinker movies? I thought CLOSER was one of the absolute worst movies I ever saw with a really great star in it. UGH. Then I watched DERAILED and thought ""well we have a little category here of really lousy Clive Owen movies"".He is a really GOOD actor. Why in the world does he get involved in these ridiculous films. I didn't care for this movie at all because it was too far-fetched. Jennifer Aniston was good as Lucinda, but not quite good enough as a bad girl type."
4,So Many Unpredictable Twists and Turns!,"Here are the basics: Charles Schine is a somewhat bored husband and father, with a fairly ordinary life. That is, until he encounters Lucinda Harris on his morning commute. I won't say any more because I don't want to give anything away! However, I will say this: this movie had so many surprising twists and turns, my jaw kept dropping! If you want a good thriller that will keep you on your toes, this movie is for you!"
2,Disappointing,"All the hype around this movie was just that hype. It is slow paced, without any real suspense and the plot twist that was suppose to be so awesome was very obvious.I was a 'friends' fan and I would like to see Jen Aniston have a sucessful movie career (especially after Brad did her wrong) but she better pick better scripts then this one if she wants longevity."
3,OK action poor story line of blackmail con,I can never understand why anyone would think blackmail will end once started.but this story the guy has terminally ill kid and he pays all of her medical cashto killers so they do not kill his family quickly as oppose to them dying slowlyfrom being bankrupt unable to pay for medical treatment of the child? please !!
4,Pay your own fare!,"After seeing this movie, one may not ever look upon Jennifer Aniston in quite the same way again. It's obvious that she's trying to break away from being stereocast as an actress for comedies. Looks like she's got her wish! This is a remarkably different role for her, and she pulls it off nicely.The premise of the movie is how two people meet up on a train heading to work. Both are married but end up fooling around anyway. It turns out to be the biggest mistake they'll ever make, and not JUST because their spouses might find out.What ensues is a chaotic nightmare that seems to just get worse & worse. Things are not all as they seem, and the story scores very high on the guage of sadistic intent. The story makes you feel like you're sinking in quicksand.So, if you're a fan of erotic thrillers, this one is certainly worth a look. I'll bet you'll pay your own fare from now on!!"
5,A THRILLER SURPRISE,"My better half rented this movie. At first, I was not going to watch it with her. That would have been a mistake. If you enjoyed thrillers such as Identity, Taking Lives, and Unfaithful, you will certainly enjoy this one. It is a much better thriller. Jennifer Aniston does a suprisingly good job in this movie (given her normal comedic roles). This thriller has enough surprises and twists in it to be a Kansas tornado. If you enjoy thrillers and plots that keep you guessing, this is the movie for you."
3,Not Enough Aniston,"Average thriller, average acting, and a phone in performance by Jennifer Aniston. If your expecting a lot of screen time, you will be greatly disappointed(as I was). She is in the film a total of about 15 minutes(tops). And after the big twist at the end, she doesn't even have any clever lines(in fact I think she has one or two words). The main reason for me in seeing the film was Jennifer, sadly she isn't given anything to do in the film. A BIG LETDOWN!!!"
2,Derailed? Nearly...,"In Derailed, the main character, played by Clive Owen, is a man under a great deal of stress. It's believable that he would meet someone like Jennifer Aniston and have an affair. What's more difficult to swallow is that he would go to such great length to cover his tracks instead of just coming clean with his wife.The acting here is probably the saving grace of the film. Owen and Aniston are great, and the rest of the cast is suitable, even if the nasty Frenchman is a little over the top.The script nearly wrecks the whole movie, trying to out-plot-twist itself too may times. In the end I was more confused than anything. Final grade: C-"
4,Smart,"Although I knew the plot before seeing the film, I have to admit that it still kept me on the edge of my seat. Didn't know that Anniston had it in her. Good action thriller with a believable plot. As usual, Clive Owen was great. I wasn't disappointed."
1,The Script Train is Derailed,"""Derailed"" is just another movie with a half-interesting premise that's wasted by bad writing and marginal acting. The script is just terrible, with a couple of plot holes that are giant and dialogue that's at best an awkward series of cliches, and at worst sparse and unengaging. The characters don't develop, and Owen's stony performance isn't at all endearing.My new policy is that movies with rappers are not on my watch list. Rza and Xzibit both are simply rotten in the movie, even though they play parts with few lines. Anniston does not much better, showing off her legs but offering no hint of any ability as an actress."
4,What a surprise.,"I didn't even want to watch this movie but I am glad I did. Derailed is a pleasant surprise. Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry together. They play Charles and Lucinda, they meet on their morning commute and there is an immediate attraction which leads to a casual and brief affair. I don't want to give too much away but their is a twist so pay attention to that detail. Good movie to watch when you are bored out of your mind. Clive Owen is a cutie pie!"
2,Forgettable & regrettable.,"Why two actors on their way up would agree to this is a mystery. Besides being inferior to 52 Pickup in every way, there is no chemistry and Jennifer Anniston comes off colder than Chicago in January.And yes, the big plot twist is 100% predictable. Even if its a surprise, so what? If you like this sort of ugly little story (blackmail - revenge) by all means, see 52 Pickup."
1,I've been DERAILED,"Was looking forward to receiving this as it was a great price. Unfortunately, I was sent the Canadian Alliance version, not the Weinstein US version as advertised, which means it was locked for my Australian Blu-Ray play. (The US version is region free.) Given the little amount I paid for this, I am not going through the process to send back, but buyer beware if you live in another country."
4,Very Good,This movie is better than most these days. If you liked fatal attraction this is worth seeing. Recommended.
2,Derailed is a fitting title for this one,"While ""Derailed"" certainly isn't the worst movie I've seen, it is far from one of the best. Clive Owen does a good job and creates a believable character. Jennifer Anniston however, does not. She just can't pull it off and it is glaringly obvious throughout the entire film. Blame it on direction or inexperience with a role of this nature but bottom line is that it isn't working.I hadn't heard much about this film so I went into it with an open mind but it is necessary to point out that the plot line is blatantly OBVIOUS right from the start. Seriously, within about 15 minutes, you will have figured the whole thing out. Derailed is a good title for this one because the whole film gets derailed almost immediately. Worth the rental fee but not worth a purchase."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great..... Just Very Average!","I think the title of my review sums up ""Derailed"" quite nicely.The 1st 30 minutes of this movie starts off very slowly. So slow in fact that my husband & I were contemplating stopping this DVD 25 minutes into ""Derailed"" because it was so boring!However, we did finish this movie and were glad that we did as the storyline does pick after the 1st 30 minutes. There were a lot of twists and turns in this movie and some suspense, however most of the major plot details were predictable! I won't bore you with the plot details as you can read what others have mentioned about the plot in their reviews.The acting in this movie was mediocre. Clive Owen's character in this movie was the most frustrating character in this movie. I had a difficult time believing some of the choices his character made in this movie!"
3,Read the book,"I think that some of the bad reviews here are overstated, but this movie definitely requires effort to suspend disbelief. It's interesting that although the plot seems pretty thin here, the book was a real page-turner."
1,Only for Clive Owen fans,"My star is for Clive Owen only - he is great as usual, although in a role that makes him look like a total wimp. The story has many holes in it as mentioned previously. Jennifer Anniston is horrible as Lucinda - totally miscast. There was no chemistry at all. How can any woman be so totally not hot around Clive Owen. And then agree to go to a seedy hotel with him. Only get this one if you're a Clive Owen fan."
2,Thriller based in Chicago,"Someone somewhere in Hollywood is really trying their best to keep Jennifer Aniston's career alive. This thriller is based in Chicago and it is fun to watch Metra Union Station, downtown and I believe Evanston sites. But even fine actors like Clive Owens and Vincent Cassel cannot save this film with a predictable plot. Female audience - watch this with your husband/boyfriend, just as a way to gently remind them that at all times they are bait for the con - even on their way to work. Perhaps this movie can help them appreciate what they've got. Otherwise, this film is really just not worth mentioning."
3,Interesting - Emotions are mixed in this one,"**Warning - Story Spoilers in the review***How strange it is that I was disturbed when ""Lucinda"" got raped, but I rejoiced and danced as she lay dying...Charles was an idiot. But I guess he's just not a killer, so giving away his money seemed like the thing to do... One mistake after another. If somebody tries to black mail you and has the nerve to COME INTO YOUR HOME, it's really really time to just take them out. I was amazed at how Charles seemed to make the wrong decisions at every turn."
1,Hated it!,Consider it one of the worst movies I've tried to watch in years. Didn't even finish watching it. Think it was due mainly to very poor script writing as I couldn't stay interested in the characters enough to even care what happened to them. Takes a much better script than this one to make the characters believeable.
3,The book is SO much better!,"I had just finished the book (yes, it was a novel first) and really enjoyed it, and I was excited to rent Derailed. It followed the book fairly well until the lackluster ending. If you weren't satisfied with the movie's ending, check out the book. Also, the character of LaRoche (named Vasquez in the book), just wasn't my vision at all. So overall, if I'd seen the movie first, I'd have given it 4 stars, but since I didn't, I have to give it 3."
3,I guess it's enertaining overall but the acting is bad,While you watch it you think to yourself is this a good or bad movie am I entertained or not. At the end of the film i found out I was entertained but the acting was not good and the film is slow at times. I would say it's entertaing becouse of the twist and turns in the movie even though I guess it half way through the film. The plot is good and remindes you of a early 90's fatel attraction type film. The acting is the downfall of the film Jennifer Anistion is bad and Clive Owen is boring the abd guessa re entertaning. I had no intrest to see the filma nd then I was enjoyed by it so overall i would recomend it.
2,I read this from the GET GO.,Clive Owens character really made me sick...he was so weak and stupid that I read this film from the get go...no wonder his marriage was in turmoil.How convenient that after he found out what was going on that he all of a sudden became the lone ranger who instantaniously became a one man hero.This piece of [...] made no sense and if you've seen as many movies as i have these poor excuses for TWISTS and TURNS are seem within the first 20 minutes of the film.
2,Plot Twists A Little Too Twisted,"First of all I cannot stand Jennifer Aniston in any way,shape or form! But wanting to watch something in this day of retread movie plots I gave it a go.I have to say Anniston was a better actress than I thought, because from the moment she meets Clive Owen it looks like she couldn't care less about him and therefore I guessed where the plot was going immediately and what her agenda really was.Why would such a cash strapped guy with a sick kid even THINK about doing what he did? I found that hard to believe.At least Aniston won't be around much longer.She's on the downhill slide to 40 and not movie star pretty at all. In fact in the hotel where the big assault happens, did anyone notice as she is sitting on the bed how much like DUSTIN HOFFMAN she is beginning to look like?Thank Brad for your fame, girl, otherwise you're just a faded TV hack."
2,downright bad or okay film,now first of all this isnt a kind of good acting and jennifer aniston looks unfit for the roll it sa sort of meg ryans role in the the cut made in 2005 and clive owens role is sassy
1,Graphic Rape Scene Warning,"It is unbelievable to me that any actress would agree to play the role Ms. Anniston plays in this movie. Any person who has ever been the victim of a sexual crime or knows someone who has will get flashbacks from this film. In the rated version the rape scene in the opening 20 minutes was the MOST AWFUL, NASEAUTING piece of film I have ever seen. The plot is based on a woman using a ""rape"" to extort money from a married man. I think it is time for consumers everywhere to let Hollywood know these rape scenes based on male directors wet dreams of rape are NOT entertaining, and do not belong in FILM. I am not saying that rape has no place in film, the scene in A Time to Kill was incredibly effective and very artistic. However this entire movie is based on a ""rape"" which is simply not entertaining."
1,20 minutes done,"I got 20 minutes into the movie, up to the point where Anistons character gets raped, and turned it off. No where did I see a warning that there was a rape scene. Meaning on the box or in the beginning intro. A reviewer said that he didn't think the movie was that violent and compared it to the uncomparable Pulp Fiction. Ignorance. Showing a rape in a movie instead of implying it and letting the audience use their imagination is a sign of a ""typical"" Hollywood movie. Pushing the boundries of creativity was not apart of making this film. The actors were good in what they had to work with."
3,"Okay movie, but get real...","The setup of this movie is too hard to take. Why on earth would anyone married to Melissa George cheat on her? The mind boggles. This is as hard to believe as ""Fatal Attraction"" where we are expected to think that someone would cheat on Anne Archer. Sure, Jennifer Aniston is worlds more attractive than Glenn Close, but still.....get real.It's difficult to feel any sympathy for Owen, the cur dog. I found better motivation for seeing him win in the end by feeling sympathy for the wife and daughter he attempted to betray."
3,"Could've Been, Wasn't, and It's Okay","Let me get this off my chest. Jennifer Aniston is amazing. Clive Owen is amazing. I've gotten tired of seeing Jennifer do her happy movies, and I'll never get tired of seeing Clive play dark roles. So I pretty much got my way when it came to the choice of actors in this movie.I'm not going to give anything away, but s for the plot, I found it a little far-fetched. Yep, it's a movie. But when I watch movies like this, I want to believe it at least a little bit. I found it a little hard that a man would do all of this for himself and a woman when he was taking away his child's future at the same time. This is not to say that this didn't keep me entertained by the movie. Yes, I attempted to solve what was going on before the movie did. And I did. It's not really hard because it's been done before. But again, I was still entertained. I'm pretty sure that's thanks to Aniston and Owen.Done before, could've been more, but it wasn't. I was still entertained."
2,"Predictable and not-very-thrilling ""thriller""","For the first 45 minutes this was one of the dullest ""thrillers"" I had ever seen. The rest of it was one of the more cliche-ridden ones you'll ever watch. Clive Owen is an advertising exec who's marriage is rocky and has a daughter with diabetes. One morning on the train he meets Jennifer Aniston and they strike up a conversation which leads to flirting which leads to an attempted affair. Something very bad happens at the hotel they go to and the rest of the movie is Clive Owen being blackmailed and trying to keep his secret from his wife and also protect Aniston.The twists in this movie aren't hard to see coming and will surprise no one. The ending is unbelievable and wraps things up too neatly. The movie has a good cast, and is a nice looking film but it takes too long for anything to happen and then when it does, it's predictable."
4,Not a movie for your first date.,"I went and saw Derailed last night on a first date. Over all it was pretty good. I thought Jennefier Aniston was good, and Clive Owen is hot. The cinematography was excellent. The story line itself is good, it was just the graphic rape scene that kind of ruined my date. I was braced stiff in my seat, and I could tell my date was uncomfortable. I guess I should have read the reviews first. On the upside, it didn't scare my date off, I have a second date, but I am forever banned from picking the movies."
2,Derailed was off the rails!,"I thought the movie was rather ordinary. I mean to watch Clive Owen go on the way he did in the movie by constantly giving in to the bad guys made it real frustrating to watch. I think the producers could have given him a bit more backbone earlier in the movie.When the re-runs are on TV, this will atleast fill 2 hours"
2,"casting against type, but typicall hitchcockian melodrama","Owens and Aniston are cast against type in this overwrought overwritten tale about two adulterers being blackmailed by an attacker. One is not who she seems to be, which is obvious anyway.Dustin Hoffman playing The Graduate, written for a blonde CA boy, was such casting. But that was a brilliant film and a brilliant actor. Harrison Ford in What Lies Beneath, not so much.This is a derivative film and so so actors, so the casting is a detraction. This plot and production are notable for cinemax or showtime at 10pm on Thur nite, but not for these stars in their prime."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This movie is very graphic in its depiction of physical and sexual violence. It is also highly predictable, relies on sappy heart string ploys, and ends far to conveniently. Miserable to watch."
1,No.,"Jennifer Aniston is a terrible film actress. She may be okay for bit parts in half hour comedy television, but she cannot carry a major film. She has no persona. She's a one note, expressionless, actress.And Clive Owen is wasted in this lame script. You will watch the film to the end, just to see how it turns out, and then be disappointed.I, regrettably, bought this film based on the recommendations in Amazon. My advise to you: Don't even rent this film."
2,"Decent, but so predictable","Not sure what twist the others here are talking about, you would have to be blind not to see this one coming. Decent acting, Clive Owens and Jennifer Anniston, with a big shout out to the RZA. This was like an adult reading a childrens suspense book, you see it coming from a mile or two away. Decent thriller, but so painfully obvious. You see everything coming before the actors due, tough to watch it unfold just like you though it would. Not a buy, only rentable in my humble opinion. Definitely could have used some more direction and story build up."
1,"A really bad film, sorry..",I'm sorry but Jennifer Aniston can't act to save her life and what is worse is that she doesn't suit this role at all. This sloppy movie is predictable and doesn't have any surprises and or twists. It's not a clever movie nor will adults be intrigued. Even the directing is lacking. By now I am wondering when Hollywood will make a decent movie again. At this rate I suspect never. If I were you I would wait until this movie comes out on HBO. Why bother even paying for it on video. For that case why wait at all. Just forget about it. sorry.
3,Give it a 3+,"I really liked the movie with some reservations. Maybe I watched too much Friends, but I did not buy Jennifer Aniston as a villian. I had read the book so I knew where the story was going and I still enjoyed it. The twists were there and I went along for the ride. One observation, why Chicago and not New York where the book took place (Long Island Railroad etc). I am from Western NY and enjoyed the ""Attica Prison"" location and that the protaginist lived in Bennington NY (a local town).All in all if you enjoy a suspenseful movie you will most likely like this one."
3,Worthy of a look-see!,"""Derailed"" takes the viewer on a thrilling journey through the perils of adultery, love and deceit. The movie has a great feel and fantastic flow of plots and subplots. Call it a thriller but not a puzzle muzzle like the ""Saw"" seriesCharles Schine (Clive Owen) has a so-called chance train meeting with the very lovely Lucinda Harris. (Jennifer Aniston) Both are married but succumb to temptation. But the mirror image is not what it seems. Catch a glimpse into happenstance.The plot thickens as an unexpected encounter is interrupted by would be robber Phillipe LaRouche. (Vincent Cassel) LaRouche takes what him wants and then leaves. But is LaRouche satisfied with want he got? Of course money is the root of all evil. Blackmail is a powerful tool for keeping secrets. Is paying the ransom Charles's only option?This DVD is worth a look or two. Maybe a purchase if you're a fan of Jennifer Aniston or Clive Owen."
5,I liked it.,"I thought this was definately a good movie. I mainly went to see it because Jennifer Aniston was in it, and althought she isn't in the movie much (I also too agree the person on the cover art looks NOTHING like her), Clive Owen was a fantastic actor in it. I think it was nice to see Jennifer playing a non-girl-next-door role, and she plays the role rather greatly. It's not something she would normally do at all (If you are expecting a F.R.I.E.N.D.S Rachel Green type-act from her, get that thought out of your head. Look at the cover art, for God sake.), but it is very great to see her do something more haunting and eerie. As for the plot, I thought it was rather cunning and clever, despite Lucinda (Aniston) doing the same cun over again. I'd also suggest you watch Jennifer's other current film, Rumour Has It. Derailed is a great film, despite what other critics say. While I prefer Aniston doing the girl-next-door roles, it was, like I said, great to see her breakaway from that."
2,TRAIN WRECK,"Derailed is a trainwreck of a movie. I mean a thriller? Please.. the whole plot was clear, the moment the `bad guy' burst into the room. Jennifer Anniston failed to bring life to her character, only sparks of interest were shown in her character. Overall she was unable to act her way into the plot. Most of her lines were probably cut in the editing room. I think Ms. Anniston should stick to situation comedy, basically she is unable to act her way out of a paperbag. This was an unfortunate debut for Exhibit, most of his lines were probably cut as well. The main character Clive Owens was the only one trying in this movie, and try as hard as he could, it was still a trainwreck. I won't detail the plot, but overall this thriller did not thrill me, and it is not worth your money at all."
3,"Intense, thrilling but Average","I feel that the movie got very badly looked at by reviewers which gave extremely awful reviews, I went to see this movie thinking it was going to be completely crap, why because it was the only movie starting on time. But fun enough I found it to be very enjoyable and suspenseful, I think the cast was reasonable good , with excellent performances from both Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston as I feel that their characters played very well off each other.If your in for a good thriller this is a move that works towards being exciting and fast-pas, with twists and turns it will have you guessing until the credits roll."
3,"It Twists, it turns....","""Derailed"" stars Jennifer Aniston(Lucinda) and Clive Owen(Charles) as two commuters who meet on a train one day when Charles misses his usual train.They develop an attraction and eventually take it to the next level. In the trashy hotel room they rent, someone breaks in and Charles' life is literally 'derailed'. The guy rapes Lucinda, beats the crap out of Charles, and the plot thickens. Believe me, it does, it adds texture to what could have been an otherwise drab imitation of a Hitchcock thriller.It's a good rental if you are fan of the genre.I thought the performances were fine and was intrigued by it up until the final frame of the movie. Good twists and turns help this movie along.Eileen F."
4,Jennifer resurrects her career by acting like Brangelina,"so irony comes in small packages right? Right! So in order to get back at Spad Bitt for cheating on her with Jon Voight's daughter/Billy Bob Thornton's ex, she plays the part of a gal who has a one night stand affair with this married guy, but then things happen that put them in a terrible situation that makes it impossible to revert the past. Very thrilling movie for the most part, with a lot of good plot twists! Highly Recommended for Aniston fans!!"
3,"Made no sense, till the big twist at the end",For most of this film I thought this doesnt make sense. The story just seemed dumb. But towards the end you see the big twist and scheme led by Jennifer Aniston and everything made sense. I didnt care for the beginning but the last part of the movie was good. I just thought Clive Owen getting away with everything he did at the end of the movie was very unrealistic. I believe he kills 2 men at 2 different times and gets lucky by not getting caught. Then he embezzels and just gets community service.But loved Clive in this film. I loved how he grabbed Jennifer Aniston and ran with her across the street and kisses her in an alley. What a passionate actor he is.Nicole M*
1,Leo Who?,"I'm truly at a loss to see when or, yet, when did Leo from the Hit Television Series Charmed wear such an outfit? Or, is this not part of the Charmed Toy Line? But, by the looks of it, I find that it is probably not a great thing, but if it interests you, then I say buy it. Until the second Toys Line, see you all."
2,is this lee ?,"I just can't believe that lee wrote this - I found it kinda of boring, it took me weeks to finish it, not at all like his stuff of header,the big head,or even his shorter stories of the likes of brain cheese buffet or you are my everything. the best part of this book was the last chapter. The book for me had none of the splaterspunk that he is noteably known for and there was no real sex , depravatiy or shocking scenes - sorry but this is just one of those books that did not do it for me like his other stories. I will of course continue to buy his work, but if you are a Lee fan, stay away from this one - BORING !!"
2,Not his best work,"I bought the kindle version and I'll admit that I'm only at 15% of the story but so far I am pretty bored with it. Not Lee's usual style at all, very little action. I keep waiting for it to get better, then I give up on it for a while and read something else. I'm not sure if I'll even finish this one."
3,Disappointed with GPS Compatability,"If you look on the cover of the box of the TOPO California you will see a picture of a Garmin etrex GPS handheld reciever. One would think with a picture of the exact same GPS handheld that one owns that it would work. It does not. The latest Garmin etrex uses an USB port to upload / download data to the PC which is not compatable with the TOPO software that uses the com1, com2 etc. ports. I wrote an email to TOPO asking how to correct this problem and they indicated that I could buy the expansion pack for the State series for about $20 and then it would work with my GPS reciever. So I went to their website to buy the expansion pack and it was priced at 24.95, and it is not availabe at this time. So it looks like I will be using Garmin's Mapsource product for all of my uploads to the PC. The problem with Mapsource is the level of detail. Its scale is 1:100000 vs. TOPO's 1:24000... But at least it works."
2,Useless with Garmin eTrex Vista C,"I won't repeat the complaints by the other reviewers but I will agree with them. I have a new Garmin eTrex Vista C GPS, which is a good product. But, Garmin wants you to buy their poor quality MapSource software. Poor quality because of the scale. National Geographic TOPO software is somewhat clumsy to use, but it will produce a fine map and does a good job for large scale use, as in hiking, etc. The problem is that Nat. Geo. deliberately misleads in its cover blurb by implying that TOPO will work with ""most popular handheld receivers."" It won't. So, if you want to produce a topographic map, with a route marked on it, and measure distances, develop elevation profiles, etc., then NatGeo TOPO is useful. If you want to upload waypoints from TOPO to your handheld GPS, be careful!"
3,good product,"The maps are OK, they scanned the paper maps and that it's about it, no enhancements, no grid correction. If you want to print maps that share two UTM quadrants you will end up with a messy UTM grid. The other problems with printing are scale and resolution. You can print only one page at the time, there is no such thing like select the area that you want to print and the scale and let the software do the page distribution on a given page size. When you want to print a map the software will ""suggest"" a scale, that scale is really something, no 1:24000, no 1:25000 is more like printing a picture that a map, however you can choose a custom scale and set to 1:24000 but then the printing quality is gone. The font on the printed map borders can not be selected and scale with the map, that means you will end up with a bigger font on a 1:24000 map than on a 1:25000 map."
1,Topo for Mac is horrible,"The PC version works ok but if you own a Mac, you are out of luck. Major glitches of very basic uses (such as unable to upload waypoints from a spreadsheet to your GPS!! Both upload and download buttons and pulldowns send you to a download only option). It is one of the few Mac apps that will lock down your computer and not respond to force quit.The interface is bizarre. Want to find a place? - go to ""Edit"". Want to find a coordinate? - go to ""View"". Want to find customer support? - go to the back of the room.iMac 2.4 ghz OS 10.5.4, Topo 4.5.0"
2,out of date,"I bought this software for a trip to state-line res. It was not on the map, even though it was built in 1979. I end up having to buy a current map from wildlife resources. This purchase was a waste of time and money both. The interface was cluncky and difficult to use. Switching areas requires switching between 6 different disks. There limited symbols that can be placed on the map. The is no draw feature to draw on the map. overall its just easier to purchase a good map for the area you are interested in and forget trying to use this package"
1,Horrible software - I returned it,Terribly written software. The installation process was a nightmare. After installing the application I tried to install 9 CDs worth of maps. After each disc the installer crashed so I had to restart the application repeatedly. It got stuck on on disc an was never able to complete the installation.With the maps I did install I found the navigation and software interface to be SLOW and not intuitive. It was a waste of money and I have returned the software to the seller.
2,NOT Great software for Mac users!,"I just installed this software on my G5 Dual 2 Gigahertz machine and am very un-satisfied with the product! It is very slow to respond and if you were planning on imaging the disks to your hard drive for faster response, forget it. This software crashes ALOT and is overall unstable. The navigation is not like previous versions of Topo! either. Does the software work? Yes. Are the maps great? Yes. It is the interface that is poor on this one. National Geographic needs to go back to the drawing board on this one!"
1,Out of date maps,"I bought this software because I am a grad student and I had to survey alpine sites around the state of Colorado. I thought it would be great. It was not. The biggest problem is that the maps are out of date. For example several hiking trails are missing. I drove up at least ten roads that had locked gates that were not on the map. Many roads are not labeled or not labeled correctly. It was good for putting waypoints in my GPS, but that is all it was good for."
1,Extremely Frustrating,"In the past 10 years of using numerous types of computer software this one has to be the worst. Even after reading the entire manual and troubleshooting tips from the website, I have spent hours trying to do things that are very simple in other software - such as simply saving a map that you have put an hour or two into creating. It is a very complicated and frustrating process. I'm sure I will finally figure it out, but I'll have to take detailed notes to be able to do it again!"
4,great collector with a small problem,"Overall this is a great product. I usually only run one tool at a time and this collector can easily handle it. The only problem that I have with it is that recently it has decided to turn itself on every so often( I'm guessing that there is a problem with the signal from the remote, but I'm not sure). I would definitely recommend going with a canister dust collector."
2,Not the heavy 18/10 claimed,"The only parts of these measuring cups that are made of the thicker 18/10 stainless steel claimed in the description are the handles. The cups themselves are of the thin, thin, thin metal, with a matte finish on the inside. Not what I expected, nor wanted. Doesn't match the odd-sized cups, which are of the thicker metal. I'll be returning these."
2,defective,i expected more from this brand. many scratches and handles are attached so some are slightly about the cup. i will return them.
4,Fantastic,"You get what you pay for, and these are definitely high quality. I expect to have these for the rest of my life. The markings are easy to read, and they do the job of measuring/scooping just as you would expect. Go figure!"
5,Sturdy and well worth the price,"These are heavy, sturdy, and good quality. My mother wanted a good set of measuring cups that wasn't flimsy. I bought this based on reviews and I was not disappointed."
4,"it changed a little, but who cares!!!","i used to have this on vhs, and i remember how cool it was, you know?? i mean some of the greatest matches in wwe history, it was fun (im old school so i grew up watching these wrestlers) then i heard it was coming to dvd and i thought how cool it would be to actually see this again, dont get me wrong it was fun watching macho man randy savage and hulk hogan, but they did cut some of the matches, one for example was the battle royal in wrestlemania 2 where andre wins it, and they also cut the part where they pay a litlle homage to all the celebrities that have had participated before, but i did not care the dvd is still fun to watch, and to remember those great wrestlers dead or alive that made this industry what it is today, for 9.99 its a great bargain that sholud not be missed!!! jibaro soy!!!!!"
1,Worthless,"Maps are way too small to show any detail. The maps are only good for major highways at best. For example, Mexico, the entire country is displayed in an area of less than 7 by 10 inches and shares this with inserts for Mexico City and Puerto Rico. New Mexico, the fifth largest state, has a slightly smaller display area and the city of Albuquerque map is 5 by 3 1/2 inches. Worthless is the best I can offer."
1,Horrible. Period.,"This is a terrible album. I listen to pretty much anything, and one day my roomate pulled this cd up. I absolutely hate the Super Furry Animals, and with a terrible name like that, it should be evident that this is a horrible band. The music is uninspiring and boring to listen to. I have pity for anyone who religiously listens to this type of ""music."""
4,Good Starting Point,This is a great book for studying the Nicean creed. I studied this book as a part of a Christian Theology class and it worked well in that context. I would also recommend use in a small group setting.
2,Lost opportunity,"Intimate glimpses of Gettysburg in history and marking the lives of its residents today, mingled with echoes of the several wars that mark the novel's characters: a fine idea for some other writer, but way beyond the skill of this one. We have too many characters for this short novel and all presented through the single, distinctly feminine, High Romantic voice of the author. Not a novel to persuade one to suspend disbelief. Not sure what the reviewers' stars are all about."
1,Never received!,"Maybe I can get a reply, I never got my scope I had to go to the store and buy one, because it's for X-mas. I wrote to the seller 3 times and never got a reply. My loss huh? I only gave it 1 star because I had too. It deserves NO STARS."
5,Great explanations for those newly diagnosed,"A thorough book with technical medical information presented in a way that is understandable by almost everyone, yet I suspect is still a good book for doctors whose speciality does not include the liver.Explanations of treatments currently available, herbs and what to expect as a Hep C patient.An easy read. I read it in an evening.And a great reference book."
3,One of the Early Hepatitis C Books,"Reviewing a book that was written more than 14 years ago does not seem fair, but with I want to acknowledge the author's contribution to the hepatitis C world. This book was one of the early hepatitis C books. It offers some good information, but it is now out of date. Thank you Ms. Turkington for helping patients in those early days when there wasn't much information."
4,Naya,"I purchased this book primarily because my Grandfather, F. Deforrest Schook, did the illustrations. The illustrations lived up to my expectations - the book was interesting for its style of writing, but not what I would have purchased were it not for the illustrations."
5,WOOOW!! WHAT A GREAT CD!!,"I was wishing to have this cd for many months ago, and recently I had the opportunity to found it! (and I doesn't lose the chance) It's the first time I've heard this one, and I was delightfull and very impressed with this cd. My favourite songs are ""Caravan"" (what powerfull drums and trumpets) and ""Frenesi"" (what a brillant and happy final), my love renditions are for ""An Affair to Remember"" and ""Solitude"", but ""What Kinf Of Fool Am I"" Is an excellent song, too. I don't conceive why this disc is out of print (I Knew this in the Ray Conniff's website), because this is one of his best works; but if you have the opportunity to have this cd, don't lose that!!"
5,Another Ray Conniff classic!,"It was 40 years ago this Ray Conniff album hit the record stores and 40 years later it is back on compact disc. You will enjoy the renditions of In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening, You Made Me Feel So Young, Patricia and Caravan. Even though Ray is gone, his style of music will live on. See if you agree!"
5,Memoirs,"Well written, often poignant. Harding chooses details and incidents to evoke an era and a style."
4,Progressive Suspension 512 Series 512-1024B,"I bought these for my 2006 Honda Rancher AT ATV. I took a chance knowing that they were not designed for this year and model ATV. I was able to install them but they were longer than the stock shocks. They are well built shocks and helped the ride quality of the ATV a little bit, but not nearly enough to justify spending $250 on them."
4,Two Figures to get one,"The Spawn figure in this box set sits among my figures alone. I did not like the Al Simmons figure that came with it. It kind of mucks up the display, however if you are a purist of the comic cover then never fear. This two box set is a complete steal for what they are being priced on Amazon. They are both very stable and can be displayed without fear of taking out other figures."
2,Poor packaging - broken ball,"I received this as a gift today, and it seems like a good quality product, but it was not packaged very good. As a result one of the balls was cracked. I've written an email to the company and am waiting a response. Also of note, this set comes in a very nice carrying case, but the storofoam used in the top stuck to the inside of the case and molded to it. Another thing - I did not receive any measuring tool with the set; just the balls and the case."
3,Nice balls. Not as pictured.,"This bocce set arrived today so I haven't had yet played with it. I'm sure it's good quality and all, but, being a graphic designer, I am very sensitive to the visual side of things and THESE BALLS ARE NOT SOLID in color. They are marbled. I did not want marbled balls. I wanted pretty solid colored balls like the ones pictured with this item description. Hmph. Marbled is just so untraditional."
2,"Same hash as Millionaire Next Door, old material different spin","The author seems to be milking a dead cow. The basics can be derived from the book that started it all, The Millionaire Next Door. Also no need to purchase ""The Millionaire Mind"", the only difference in this book is the shift in pronouns, where TMND used, ""them, they, etc"" the follow-up TMM uses ""us, we, etc""."
2,Overstuffed Disappointment,"Hoping this book could help in building a career as a financial advisor, I was disappointed at the lack of editing (this book is 200 pages too long) and the inclusion of some letters Stanley had written and the replies he received. Not a total waste for he does point out how many of the rich and/or socially prominent do not get approached. Some ideas, like having plaques made for potential clients you don't know, seems odd. Not nearly as helpful as Leroy Gross' ""Art of Selling Intangibles"" or Nick Murray's ""The Excellent Investment Advisor."""
5,EXCITING!,The caterpillar leaves the Silk Palace. The caterpillar learns about the forest. The caterpillar meets a lot of strange characters who teach her many things. THe caterpillar searches for the last real butterfly. So fun you shouldn't wait for the cartoon. Read it!!!
3,Esperaba más de éste libro,"Dadas las altas calificaciones que tenía el libro tuve expectativas muy altas del mismo cuando lo compré. Y cuando lo recibí la verdad es que esperaba más. El libro me pareció muy sencillo y corto. En sí el contenido no es malo, pero por el precio uno esperaría algo más."
3,doctor doolittle,"this book is great book for kids that like funny and action packed stories. This book was really good and is a quick easy book to read. So, if you're a book worm this is one you have to read before you die!!!!"
1,Don't do it!!,"Do not even waste your time getting this. First of all it's very diffucult to get it to the proper consistency, not too watery that is slips off the spoon and not too thick or it won't go down her throat. Even my daughter thought it wasn't worth the hassell and said ""let's just pretend"". If you are lucky enough to get the right consistency and it actually comes out the other end (sitting her on the potty is another story), it takes a long time to all come out and then it's a pain to clean it up. Don't do it, I'm telling you!"
4,"Great shirt, a little too long in the waist tho","the shirt was great. loved the fabric and the fit around the chest and shoulders. but it seemed a bit too long in the waist area. i'm 5'9"" and the small size shirt i could pull down--without stretching it out too far--to the top/middle of my thighs."
5,Mouse works great.,"I needed a PSI mouse for a kvm switch and ordered this one, which filled the bill. No problems."
5,I am using it right now!!,"I bought this mouse for home use, and we have them at work, and it works absolutley wonderful. Its super smooth, easy to manueaver, and easy on the wrist. Also, it will not take over another USB port on your computer, leaving your USB ports open for other things. I love the price too, very affordable. Overall I would recomment this product."
4,Great Low Cost PS/2 Optical Mouse,"My poor Microsoft Optical Blue Mouse finally died after five years so I decided to look for a low cost replacement. This one from Logitech fit the bill as I wanted a mouse to work with the PS/2 mouse port instead of USB plus I didn't need one with fancy extra buttons I would never use. A great deal for under $10 if you need a PS/2 optical mouse for your PC without extras. The size is right, scroll wheel works just fine and no problems to report using it.It started working perfectly without any adjustments in the control panel for the mouse with my Windows XP operating system after I shutdown then restarted the computer to change over the mouse.I'm glad to be back using an optical mouse from digging out an ancient Microsoft mouse (non-optical, the old ball type) which had no scroll wheel to use for a few days until this arrived."
5,Fits your pocket book quit well,"If you are hesitating to order this product because of the low price - forget it. Order it now. This mouse fits the normal sized hand like a glove. It is light and moves effortlessly with the slightest touch. If you are looking for a mouse with a no brain er installation, this is the one to purchase."
2,Junk,"This mouse is a piece of junk. Think it may be due to the optical sensor being cheap. My other optical mouse tracks without issue on my desk, but this mouse refuses to keep tracking properly on the dull dark surface. If I stick paper or something under it, it will track though. My other mouse is a cheap Microsoft. Not that the brand is better, just my original mouse works like a champ on any surface and was cheap aswell."
5,Optical Wheel Mouse Black Oem PS/2,Amazon has always been good to me and I purchased 2 of these and they are perfect for my pcs. I am very satisfied. I read the other reviews on this mouse and found other customers to be satisfied. Those reviews helped me decide to purchase 2 and I am glad I did. I have other Logitech products connected to my pcs and am happy with their performance.
3,Does the Job,"I like this product because it is clean looking and does the job properly even sometimes the optical sensor is very sensitive, I have a real long time using it and I can say is very durable too."
3,I never used it because it does not have a USB input,"I never used it because it does not have a USB input. However, i am comfortable to use it since I had this kind of logitech mouse before."
1,Poor performance,"This is a poor product, the left button does not start programs you have to use the right button to open. The left button is slow to respond, makes it hard to use."
1,"Sadly, would not load at all with Vista.","I repeatedly contacted Pogo, EA, and Oberon Media, as requested by Pogo and EA, trying to fix the game. Sadly, I can't get it to load at all, which disappoints me greatly because I know I enjoy at least 2 of the games."
1,"Semi fun games, not good ""to go"" on a laptop.","These games are relatively fun but the disc must be inserted EVERY time you want to play. I bought these to play on my laptop ""to go"" like the titles say, I want my games loaded on my hard drive so I don't have to cart around a bunch of discs, I'll never buy another game by Pogo. I understand the need for copy protection but not at the expense of convenience for the consumer. Buy games from PopCap, they load on your hard drive (no discs to carry around or hunt for) and are MUCH more fun to play!"
4,Triple Threat? Only partially.,"Two of the games in this three-pack are favorites of mine from the old Pogo.com site. 'Word Whomp' has always been my best game, and the disc version gives just as much enjoyment. 'Poppit' is a frustrating game to me (I suppose that's why I keep trying) because the instructions aren't very helpful in learning how to win the game. I haven't managed it with either the on-line or the disc version. 'Phlinx' is a game I haven't had enough experience to comment about, but I think it looked interesting enough to have purchased it. Overall, this item rates an A+ for value, but only a B for game play."
1,R/C Mack Garbage Truck,"R/C Mack Garbage TruckWORST TOY EVER!PARENTS beware - it comes from several different retailers already broken in its original box (gears already disengaged or stripped, wires disconnected, not able to be fixed). All versions (including those with different remote controls) are the same basic product that is originally produced in China and then shipped to other countries to be sold under different retailers/titles. Save yourself a lot of time, frustration, shipping, and handling, and your child's disappointment.RETAILERS also beware - offering this truck as part of your inventory creates an impression that you sell disreputable items that are cheap and not cost-effective (especially if your customer service unit continually denies that there is a problem with the truck). As one reputable retailer said, ""We have a high return rate on this item. I'm refunding your cost, shipping, and handling immediately. I'm so sorry."" You will lose customers over this item."
1,Never played with.,"This toy had to be returned before it was given as a gift. I put in new batteries so it could be played with as soon as opened. It didn't work at all. Needless to say it is going back immediately. At least, I don't have a disappointed child with a broken toy. Just have to start shopping again at this late date."
1,Would Not Recommend,We had to return the first truck since the remote control did not work. The second truck failed a few months later. I did not return it since my grandson plays with it without the remote control. I could have purchased a cheaper truck without a remote control. I would not recommend this product.
2,Odd,"I wish this book had not been done as a novel, but rather as a report of an actual trip. I don't know why it wasn't, since it seems to have been based on one. Anyway, I never felt much for this narrator, who goes wandering around smoking hash and matter-of-factly looking up Brion Gysin (who for some reason keeps letting him in) whenever he happens to be in Morocco. In the end he manages to take a completely fascinating cultural and musical world and figure out little about it. What was the point? I still don't know. Those interested in Jajouka would be best served listening to its music instead."
4,"Wonderful book, wonderful trip","Just happened upon this book at the house of a friend; I had never heard of its existence but had long been fascinated by the musicians of Jajouka, even though I knew little about them. What a wonderful book! Not really a novel, just done up that way to protect some of the participants, I suppose. Whether it's accurate or not (re: one of the other reviews), they can fight that out between themselves. But I was transported to this incredibly unique place & culture, a vestige of very ancient quasi-spiritual traditions garbed in Arab robes, at a critical juncture in its history - from its full-flowering to its near-extinction in the space of two decades. Stephen Davis was privy to something very, very special, and I thank him for sharing something so hard to capture - the mystical engagement of music and tradition (wreathed in a halo of kif smoke as well!) - in such a beautiful, touching and readable fashion."
2,Capitalism ruins ancient tribal musicians village,I thought I might be the only person to consider the role of money in the fighting that broke up the peaceful village.The writer is loose with the facts and down right inaccurate in my case. I should know I was there.
1,Would never buy another one of these scales,"I have just thrown out two of these scales. I had kept them hoping I could find someone who could tell me why I keptgetting an error message, but to no avail. No service, no nothing. I took them back to Office Depot where they were purchased and got no satisfaction at all.Only buy these scales if you want to have them work for about 3 months. They definitely aren't worth the money."
4,Good deal for the price,"Received products quickly - seller customer service was great.The product itself, is definitely a bit more on the purple side than pink like others have mentioned. But gets the job done for me!"
1,Have you ever been in love with someone you hardly knew?,"Well, someone that claims to love Boingo hardly seems to know them at all. This book has many glaring omitions and no actual information about the band members (Excluding Danny Elfman). This reads like a student term paper (I'd give it a ""C""), full of quotes and footnotes and very little original information about the band's politics, fighting and creative process. There were a lot of guys in this outfit besides Elfman that I would have liked to learn more about. The author spends page after page giving his humble opinion about EVERY song on every album. BORING! How about why Kerry Hatch left the band, why did John Hernandez leave and return, etc. This could have been much, much more interesting."
2,"Kudos for writing it, but...","Kudos for writing it, but this is nothing more than a re-writing of other people's interviews and work, and most ""factual"" information is based on the writer's own bootleg collection. And being close with the band for many years, 40% of this book I know to be absolutely wrong. Speculation is not fact. I'd rather have a book that is 50 less pages than watch the author try to piece things together and fill in the gaps with his own weirdness. It does have its amusments though, and reprints of interviews/reviews that would be difficult to track down otherwise, but it simply isn't worth the price of admission."
3,in defense...,A lot of heat in that last review. I have never been tempted to write a review - but I thought this was a pretty decent book. I found the book interesting. I emailed the author and asked him about some of this controversy. He says- in response- that #1 the book was self-published because no one wanted to publish a book about Boingo (sorry but the band isn't a big hit machine. #2 forget what the curmudgeon Boingo member said several old band members have read the book and-hold your breath!-liked it. #3 it is not the Brothers K. I recommend it not because it is brilliant and amazingly well written. Not because it had every i dotted and t crossed. I recommend it because I love the band and I love that this guy wrote it. That's what fans do.
2,Interesting but NOT ACCURATE...,"The author offers a lot of very interesting information about the early days with the Mystic Knights, but beware...there is a lot of incorrect information here. Breese is incorrect about band members' credits and even the titles of films they've scored. It makes one wonder if other information is also wrong. Don't get excited about the number of pages either. A lot of it is wasted on the author's boring opinions and descriptions of his favorite songs."
3,"Great time killer, but...","Finding info on Boingo can be frustrating, and this book solves a lot of the problem- full of info and insight, but also CHOCK FULL of typos and misinformation. A great primer, esp. finding out about 'lost' tracks, but this is more of a fan-boy perspective, as opposed to a clinical overview of Boingo's wonderful career. All the above aside, it's still an entertaining read, and I couldn't put it down- finsished it in one night.Thanks to Keith for the first, semi-definitive book."
4,great fun,"I really enjoyed this book. As a true Boingo fan (at least from the late 80's)I'd been aware of the book before it came out and was impressed when it did. Hey, to think that it was even made is more than enough reason to buy it.It is interesting to note that a reader below mentioned that the artwork was from a stranger. Well, maybe to you. Actually the artist whose work illustrates the book is a hot new talent in L.A., his animation has become something of a cult fad. Cool that he lent his work to this project.Also heard, through a friend, that the author is considering re-issuing the book in a re-edited format (fixing the typos and adding new info since he's talked to some of the band members in detail since the book was published.)Don't know if it will happen though...anyway, enjoy!"
2,fluff,"This book is great if you want to know what kind of rigging eachship had. You will not get how many crewman it took to sail each ship unless its a galley then you can figure it out by how many oars it had. On some you will get the tonnage of a particular ship but not always. You don't get any idea the cargo it was able to hold in tonnage or what type of cargo it mainly shipped. Nothing about what kind of weaponary ie cannon6pounder,12pounder etc. I did like the pictures. I did learn about ships that I never knew existed. Thats why I said fluffin the title."
3,Not a great read...,"A fictional novel where a female scientist has designed a virus to kill off all men. She then takes over the country and develops methods by which pregnancies can be started by egg manipulation. They have armies to kill off any remaining men. But it turns out that the reproduction methods have serious drawbacks they can't solve, so they are killing themselves off. One remaining man exists, and ends up being the person they need to save them. Too much feminist jargon that turns out to be faulty in the end."
1,"A depressing, ugly view of a future with passive women",The biological possiblities of asexual reproduction are over-stressed and ultimately boring. The worst part of this book's view of the future is the utter passivity and incompetence of a world of women. All technology (except biological research) breaks down - presumably there are no competent women engineers to run anything. The women allow themselves to be pushed by a totalitarian government into a lifestyle they despise. Reviews of the book describe Diana as a man-hating woman; I have to feel that the author is a woman-hating man to portray such a gloomy result of female dominance.
1,Two great minds,"In 1991-1992 I wrote a book dealing with the same subject and came to the same conclusions. I tried to interest some publishers in Israel (I write in Hebrew) and, since I was rejected for all the wrong reasons, I put it aside just to learn, ten years later, that a more persistent author overcame the publisher's opinion.I learned about the Red Queen only when an Australian resarcher (Dr. Orly Lacham-Kaplan) became famous for a method in which no male sperm is needed for fertilization. When I told her about my book she told me about Dirk Draulans's book which, according to her, was the same book as mine.I am not acusing anybody of plagiarism, but I am afraid that it is too late for me now to try and publish something that has already been published.Since then I made a few changes in the novel, returned the men to life and spread love and hope in the miserable world I had built. The reason I rank the Red Queen only 1 star is that the author failed to make those corrections."
3,Quality Assurance and Food Safety,"I have gone through the book recently. Since the author is a recognized quality auditor, he has done a great job for Quality Assuarnce of food products. The people are working in food processing sector and academicians are really looking for a informative and usable book that provide them fundamental and in depth knowledge of Quality Assurance System. The book has covered all the topics related to Total Quality Management. It starts with good manufacturing practices and gradually goes in depth of other quality systems like hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and finally discusses elaborately ISO-9000. I must appreciate the author regarding the presentation of the topics systematically and lucid way. The professionals from food processing industry and academic institute will like the book for their use."
4,Nice Product,"A nice product and a fair price. I could wish it weren't strung so tightly, there is no flow to the mala beads, otherwise a very nice well made. The beads themselves are not very uniform in finish when they arrive however a few uses and the sheen they aquire from handling is very pleasant."
3,American Made ?,I don't have a review but a question. Is this Fender 70's Stratocaster an American made strat or Japanese or Mexican because the American made one's sell for around $1500.00 brand new. If they are American made then it's a great deal.
2,5.1 speakers do not work,"I am unable to get my 5.1 speaker system to work with the m7250n media center PC. I have tried everything I know but the rear speakers do not work when I watch live TV. If I record a portion of the same TV show and then play back the recording, then the rear speakers work. I find this very strange. I have had numerouse discussions with HP support and they don't seem to know how to get the rear speakers to work with live TV. The specifications for the m7250n say that this media center PC will support up to 7.1 speaker system. I believe the manufacture has sold me a bill of goods.I any person out there can tell me how to configure this PC for 5.1 speakers, I would appreciate it very much. I am also interested to know just how many people are having the same problem.If any person is contemplating buying a m7250n in anticipation of having quality 5.1 sound, then they take a very long look before buying.A concerned consumer"
1,Buyer Beware!,"My first comment is that if you are going to purchase this or any other HP Media Center, you'd better hope it arrives in perfect operating condition or you may experience the worst customer support imaginable. Other than their ignorance, arrogance and absolute unwillingness to listen or document any conversation, there is no method of resolving issues, no matter how far they escalate the case. Secondly, if you use any type of real-time digital music workstation hardware or software, it probably will not work. Windows XP Media Center is not compatible with nearly all music production and editing hardware or software. Altough this is the only operating system that has this flaw, HP did not feel it necessary to point this out on advertising or in any informational material."
4,Good Product Overall,"Good PC, OK Media Center if you can find it at less than $1000. HP should have included a personal media drive and better software configuration if they wanted this PC to be a great value. Too many extras to buy in order to take full advantage of everything this unit has to offer. As a result, the total price on this unit can easily exceed $1700.00 and you may be able to find a better media center for less."
5,I bought this product and I have no problem,"Everything works fine. The sound is very good. You can do several things at the same time.Some of the problems related with the sounds is installation.The lightscribe is simply amazing. Great!!If I have to buy this equipment again, I will do It."
1,"Not what I heard, and what I expected!!","1. Not what you get for THE PRICE.2. This was too heavy for my skin(combination).3. I started having acne after using this. (After I discontinued this, acne started fading away with time, and did not reappear)4. Very greasy.Enough reasons not to buy this again."
3,ok documentary on the beastie boys,"if youre expecting the edge and coolness of the beastie boys in this documentary, youre not gonna find it. its a decent biographical look at them and their music, but be advised there is NO beastie boy music or interview, which sucks."
4,My baby loves this bouncer!,"This is a sturdy bouncer. There are many programmed musical selections, and the toy bar can be placed within easy reach of little hands. The only problems I can see are 1) there are only 2 settings for the toy bar position, so some babies may need to deal with having it too close because the length of their arms have not caught up with the distance of their sight; 2) the music bar does not automatically run through an entire song if you press it repeatedly. Our 3-month old likes to grab on and wave the music bar in the middle back and forth, so we get to enjoy the beginning of every song, yet never hear them the whole way through. The lights on this are entertaining, and the vibration level is just right. The whole bouncer is light enough to transport baby from room to room without having to take her out."
2,COULD BE BETTER!!!!!!!!,"This item has everything you need in a bouncer seat. A very adorable pattern, lights, music, toys and vibrating mechanism. However the quality is not the best. When I first received this item the toys on the toy bar were broken off. I had to send it back and wait for a new one. When the new one arrived, the vibrating mechanism stopped working after the first week and I ended up sending this one back. I went ahead and ordered a third one being this bouncer seat has everything that a lot of others don't. The third one I received has been ok although the vibration doesn't vibrate that much. The advertisement mentions two speed vibration and so does the box, however it only has 1 speed. The directions indicate the light bar requires AA batteries however it takes AAA batteries. Delta Corporation could have done a better job with the instructions and advertising. Very misleading!!!!!!!!!"
2,not that great-very disappointing,"I purchased this bouncer early on because I loved the theme. I should have waited to throw out the box. I was just so excited to have it that I opened it as soon as I got home. (It was one of the first things I bought for my baby.) Now that my baby is here, I am very disappointed with this product. It doesn't support a baby's small head like I would like it to, so I don't like to put my child in it. Also the music is way to loud & annoying. I wish there was a way to adjust it. The toys are not very appealing to a baby.Update:Now that my baby is a little older I find that her head falls over some but I am able to stop that by placing a rolled up towel next to one side of her head. Seems to help a lot. I still think about getting a better one though. As for the toy bar...a little piece of duct tape over the speaker holes works wonders...now the music isn't blasting in my baby's face."
1,Safety Hazard DON'T BUY!!!,My son is 5 months old. He has recently learned to roll over. This bouncy only secures your infant in at the waist. My son tried to roll out of it. He did succeed in rolling the top half of his body out. His lower half of course was stuck due to being strapped in. This caused him to be hanging upside down out of the bouncy with nowhere to go.
1,please do not buy it ...,"I search on the web and bought it for my new born when it was delivered i assembled it and think to put battries when baby will sit in it.But unfortunately when we tried to start it , it was not giving any music , 1st it was very difficult to find where to put battries for music , then we were never able to listen any music or viberation so i was very disappointed."
2,Not the greatest,"This item was not the best product for my little one. While it was extremely easy to put together it was at the same time frustrating to use. It took a while for my child to learn how to make the lights come on. The vibrating feature made her cry, rather than soothe her, and it is not very sturdy: my infant flipped out of it onto the floor in my presense before I could prevent it. Luckily the room was carpeted. Great for sitting a sleeping baby in but I wouldn't recommend it for entertainment purposes verses a more stury option, or even a swing."
2,Does not work properly,"I am 3 weeks away from having my child and wanted to get everything out of the way. When I saw this I thought it would be great but it was a turn down. When I first recieved it, I put it all together but the music and lights would not work. I worked with it for a while then got them to ship me another one. The same deal with 2nd one. I finally emailed them to let them know what was going on and I was told that it is a huge problem and they are not sure when it would be fixed. Very disappointing for I wish I would have known that before getting the 2nd one."
1,It scares her,"I received this bouncer as a gift. Unfortunately, I threw out the box before we tried it and couldn't return it.The bouncer itself is not too bad for a baby who can sit up already. But, for a smaller baby, there is nothing to hold their head upright.The bar that attaches plays music, has lights, and toys hanging from it. The music is so loud that it scares my baby. The lights are bright, but I think the music was all that scared her. There is a toy with a mirror attached, but the mirror is not positioned where a baby can see themselves in it. Plus, the mirror is so tiny they wouldn't see much if they could look into it."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I registered for this bouncer because I wanted a simple bouncer seat, without all the bells and whistles featured on the other bouncers. Now I wish I'd gone with something else -- the bouncer is poorly manufactured and defective. When I first tried to use this brand new bouncer, I discovered that one of the legs was warped so that the bouncer won't sit flat on a surface, making it unsafe for my baby. One of the toys on the activity bar was broken, leaving a dangerously sharp edge that makes the activity bar unusable. And besides that, the picture on the seat is pretty hideous. Go for something more expensive -- this one is not only cheap, it's cheaply made."
2,Does the job,I babysit and I needed a bouncy seat. This bouncer is cute but majorly loud; there is no volume control. I would not get this for my own child but I needed something to sit the baby in when I'm at my house. It is sturdy enough and the lights are great along with the music but way too loud. It does the job but I wouldn't recommend for long term use.
1,Waste of money... MUCH BETTER OUT THERE!,"This was the first bouncer I bought. The lights move WAY too fast for my daughter. She ended up getting frustrated at them. The music is too loud in a semi-quiet environment. She could not activate the music herself because it was too hard for her to reach and knock the dangling toys. Plus, when she sat in it the seat was too straight up. She would flop all over like a fish. I HIGHLY reccomend the Kick & Play by Fisher Price. It's a bit more money, but HIGHLY worth it!"
4,a little loud but worth the price,"I've been using this bouncer for about two months now and my little girl enjoys it quite a bit, and we haven't even used the vibrating feature. I love the cute pattern and the music isn't too bad( just a little loud)Assembly was super easy, I didn't even have to look at the instructions! Overall this is a really great buy. I highly reccomend it."
2,Pretty boring,"We received this bouncer as a gift and thought we'd give it a try. My son is 8 weeks old and is very bored sitting in it. The toys don't hang at the right height or angle and the music in only activated by a very hard push on the center toy. I'm not sure how the manufacturer expects an infant to get it started. Also, the music and lights only play for about 30 seconds for every time the toy is pushed. So this means that we have to have him sitting right beside us and keep activating the music and lights, not very practical. Also, son slumps down terribly in this bouncer. It has no support in it.The good points I will give it are that it's very easy to wash and lightweight to move around the house."
3,"Very cute, and economical...BUT......","I love the bouncer it's cute, it's cheap, and it works rather well, BUT...... I had to take the first one I bought back because the center toy had broken off, don't turn it sideways or twist it back and forth it or yours will probably break off too (mine came out of the box broken) Also the lights and music only work half of the time but the vibration works well. All in all I'd say it's worth [the money], but, it could have been made better!!"
1,DO NOT BUY! READ FOR MORE INFO.,I bought one of these for our server. I was terrified when within the first 3 months all data on the Ram Drive was lost. I had backups so I restored. But it happened again and I had had enough. I put it in my desktop thinking it didn't like the server but after a couple months of use IT DID IT AGAIN! All data was lost. I am no longer going to use it for anything other than a pagefile drive. At least if the pagefile goes Poof it's no big loss. Overall this is my second disppointment with the Gigabyte brand (a Dead motherboard and now this). Also this is not any noticeably faster than an SSD drive which holds a lot more data for the same price and is more reliable.
4,Canadian version,"This is the same book as ""Trees of the Northern United States and Canada"" by the same author. As I understand it Canadian books cannot be sold in the US, so this one got a US dust cover and a new ISBN number and became a US book. And a quite attractive one it is too: this is a lot better buy than George W.D. Symonds' ""The Tree identification book""."
3,Okay..............,Slightly easy to install but not for novices. Had problems with the software and it wouldnt install. To even get tech support you have to submit a form via their web site and wait 72 hours for conformation. But overall and okay burner for the price.
1,Not user friendly,"Buyer beware! hardwear installs easy-BUT WAIT! install disc is not formatted, which means some newer PC's will not allow it to be installed. Tried to contact manufacturer, no recourse given out out box and used, no return, don't have any formatted disc's either, so be very careful, nothing on box to let you know of this Tim. R."
4,Very good job but the sound quality on PSR&T is better.,"Just got it in the mail and listening to it for the second time. It is a great sounding version but what jumps out is how it does not sounds as good as Parsley Sage Rosemary the Thyme. I understand that Simon and Garfunkel may have had better equipment available to them for PSR&T. I also understand that this may be the best version that could have been produced. I would have thought that Audio Fidelity would have released this one prior to PSR&T. That being said, I would love to see them continue to release S&G CDs. Just a small quibble overall. Do not allow my negative talk to stop you from buying your copy. That would be a major mistake. They are only minor complaints."
3,Couple of good ones,"This album is a lot like the first album of Simon and Garfunkel. Of course, it has the great hits like the title track, I am a Rock, and Kathy's song, but the rest is pretty bland and inconsistent. The remastering has done little to help. Besides the highly successful tunes, nothing is really that great. Also, as an album, it doesn't seem like song order and production really matter. I would recommend all of the other album's before this because they are absolutely amazing. You might also consider the greatest hits album which carries the 3 most popular tracks. As an album this one just gets too boring after a bit."
3,Hit or Miss,"""Sounds of Silence"" the song is among the best that Simon and Garfunkle ever recorded. It is folk rock with an edge, in the spirit of Bob Dylan's best work. The album of the same name, however, is a dicier proposition. It feels like it was assembled as a launching pad for the song, rather than recorded as a conceptualized whole. There are other strong points, including the poigniant ""Like a Rock,"" the suicide lament ""Richard Cory"" the haunting ballad ""April Come She Will"" and ""A Most Peculiar Man,"" which is as engagingly strange as its title. The rest of the material, however, is spotty, dated, and of lesser interest.Overall, I would recommend this album for Simon and Garfunkle completists only. Casual fans would be better off with one of their numerous anthology albums, all of which contain the title song."
4,A Slice of 1966,"The reviewers who have canned this album (or at least some of its tracks) for sounding ""dated"" have overlooked what for me is its most endearing feature. The song that came in for the most serious bashing ""We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin' Baby"" is for me (after Sounds of Silence itself) the best song on the album. It's a perfect little slice of 1966 (and you can dance to it). One reviewer asked ""who says 'groovy' anymore?"" Nobody, of course which is why the song is so priceless!"
5,Simply ingenious,"Anyone who says this cd is ""a nice little collection of music, but not nearly their best"" should have their heads examined. I have never in my life heard a better collection of brilliantly written, yet quite up-beat tracks. Sound of Silence is easily the duo's greatest accomplishment. Leaves That Are Green Turn To Brown is a great look at the passing of time. Blessed is a nice mix of rock and the bible. Kathy's song is so beautiful and full of texture. Somewhere They Can't Find Me is superb with it's tricky guitar picking. Anji, though contains no words, is a delight to listen to. Richard Cory is an upbeat wonder. April Come She Will is a nursery rhyme put to a beautiful rhythm. A Most Peculiar Man is haunting, and original. And finally I am A Rock has some of the most cleaver lyrics dealing with someone who is paranoid, ever. This is a must."
3,Worth the price,It was worth the price to get the one tune and have a hard copy of the Cd. I would buy it again.
4,Nostalgia,"Another great look into the past. When you don't listen to this for awhile, you forget how amazing it is."
5,prefer this sounds of silence...,"I prefer the version of sounds of silence here to the one on 3am. they are both good, but in my opinion this one is much more dramatic and moving. they sound a tiny bit off on the 3am one. this cd is a must have for everyone who likes truly great music."
5,"Excellent devotional, buy the printing from Nabu Press, not General Books","The publishing from General Books was printed from the original text using OCR scanning technology, and was not edited for accuracy after the fact. In many places, the words are just nonsensical because the OCR didn't recognize the characters properly on the page scan. I found the version fromNabu Pressto just be a direct scan of the original text, and so there are no OCR issues. Definitely buy this book, just not the General Books version."
2,Works for a Grand Cherokee,"This unit will not work for you if there is not a suitable spot on your dash. The Grand Cherokee (2003) has an indentation in the dash that this fits perfectly. If not for that, it would be slidung off the dash."
1,very disappointed,"tried to find this cd for a long time, after ordering & receiving it...I put cd on to play and high road to china song came on first, but after that it seemed to not have all the music I thought it should, not even close...very disappointed....not amazon's fault but the sellers."
5,Michelle does it again!,"I'm a big fan of Michelle and was excited to get this video - she didn't let me down! This video combines fun cardio with basic toning resulting in a great moderate to high intensity workout. Of course, there are modifications, and you can vary the weight you use in the toning sections based on your level of experience. The workout is broken into 6 circuts, plus a warm up and cool down. The video even has a shortened 30 minute version for the days when you're running short on time. The exercisers in the video are all clients of Michelle's. The music and energy of the video are great and I look forward to doing this video regularly."
5,Well paced,"Agree with many of the other reviewers. Some of the moves are tough to follow at first, but after a few work-outs it is easy to follow. Great workout; sweat everytime. Also like the express workout; perfect for mornings I have overslept. Looking forward to her other videos."
1,not for beginners...,"i am getting back into working out after a few years of being pretty lazy....so i was looking for something ""easy"" and decided on this...oops! not for beginners...and way too much up and down (one minute you're doing cardio, the next minute you are on the floor and then back again). However, if you are a ""workout fool"" then this is for you!! I'm going to put this one on the back shelve for a while and come back to it when I am a little more advanced!"
1,Sought Out a Place to Express My Dislike,"I usually read the reviews for products, but rarely write them. This DVD made me want to find a place to review it- I was nearly yelling at the computer screen for the first 20 minutes of the full workout, then I just skipped to the end to do ab work & cool down.I'm new to workout videos so maybe this is common, but she created and switched moves so fast that by the time I understood what she was doing she had already moved on. This did not make me feel as though 'everyone could do it,' it made me feel slow and out of shape (which I am not). It also made me feel as though I had never actually 'worked out' from ANY of the moves because of my confusion. I also did not have the 'props' I was expected to use, which seemed almost mandatory to the workout.All in all, I have found other (cheaper) videos which are amazing in comparison and do not frustrate me so completely. Check it out from your local library before spending the money."
1,Defective,"Only the introduction played without a problem. The first time I reviewed the exercise and it worked but then the next morning when I was ready to do the workout, it wouldn't play. It seemed to be stuck - I couldn't get it to do anything. I've ordered many workout DVDs from Amazon and have never had a problem until this one.Hopefully this was the only bad one in the bunch."
5,well rounded workout with weights,"I really like this video so far, but I have only done the express workout (35 minutes). I bought it because I had a video that Michelle did a while back (VHS!) called Pilates Plus that I really liked AND it had really good reviews. I like that there is aerobic, weights, floor work and resistance band work. It is very well rounded - I guess that is why it is called circuit - duh. You can make it easier or more difficult depending on your condition. I liked it so much that I also bought the cardio video to alternate with this video every other day."
4,Well written and delightful Southwestern Cook Book,Seasons of Sante Fe is a well-written and delighful Southwestern US cookbook experience with some of the best recipes for this style of cooking we have ever had in our home. We love it so much that we ordered numerous copies as gifts for friends and family. Much of the proceeds for this book go to preparing and delivering meals to many in that area who are in need. We discovered Seasons of Sante Fe on a recent trip to that beautiful and historical city that is packed with art and culture much of which is the product of native Americans. This is a great and wonderful cook book.
5,Best of the Best,"I live in California and we arguably have some of the best cheeses in the world out here. I'm originally from New York where I worked 4 years in a Sicilian restaurant, and my taste buds prefer whole milk products with low salt. I've tried a lot of dried cheddar cheeses in my cooking and baking, but I have to admit that this cheese powder from Ohio of all places is the best I have ever used. I am 50 years old, but I also have to shamefully admit that by adding a teaspoon of this cheese powder to the mix, I am once again like a little kid and I now occassionally enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni & cheese."
2,Here's My Gripe...,"While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese. The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for. When i got this I thought this would be great to have, now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese. That was the only benefit....This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature. It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box. It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ...Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner. No dyes no artificial colors or flavors. Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese. Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese."
1,Monster Shipping Charge!,I bought this dried cheese last year but will have to go elsewhere for more - the shipping is 137% of the price of the product and that is too much.
2,Should Have Known Better,"I was hoping to use this as a lightweight substitute for some of the cheddar cheese I carry on backpacking trips. It turns out to be poorly suited for that purpose--didn't mix into the food easily, didn't taste like cheese, and didn't feel satisfying to eat like a slice of cheese. Unless I find someone to give it to, I'll end up throwing it away."
2,Not the quality I expected,"I chose this brand of cheese powder over Trio, which I'd used in the past and really liked, because this was less expensive. It came with no directions at all so I winged it remembering how I'd used the Trio sauce. This ended up thin and very salty. I had to eventually add thickener to get the consistency without making it horribly salty, but that made it more a ""gravy"" than a ""sauce"". I'll still use it up, but won't buy it again."
3,Its alright,I was hoping it would be more like the Kraft M&C but it wasn't. I could see where it would be good on popcorn though.
2,Wasn't as Sharp as I would like,This wasn't the flavor I was looking for it is bordering on sweet... not the sharp tangy taste I was looking for.
2,"Good flavor, bad texture.","The flavor of this product is similar to Kraft cheese topping, but the resemblance stops there. The texture itself isn't bad, but it clumps slightly, so it's difficult to sprinkle onto food. I've tried it on buttered toast, popcorn and eggs. When it comes in contact with moisture, it forms small, hard, chewy clumps. I haven't tried it on pasta, but I have to assume it would do the same thing. I don't think I'll buy this product again, only because I can't think of anything I can use it with."
5,cheesy review =p,Bought 5LB of this cheese and I use it for mac and cheese. Very good cheese sauce I would definitely buy more!
2,Mistake,"I gave this a few tries and ended up binning the rest. I am not a Mac and Cheese person, I did try to roll my own with some pasta also tried with instant mashed potatoes. Worth a try in either case."
2,Cheddar Cheese Powder Barry Farm,Too many chemicals including Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 coloring . I had to return it. I should have checked the ingredients beforehand.
2,Blech...and VERY orange,"Very orange cheese power. Tastes a bit like the packaged 'mac and cheese' type product, but for the price, I'd rather buy the packaged 'mac and cheese'.Doesn't have much cheese flavor but sure has a lot of orange coloring...When making M&C;, I find myself adding other ingredients to get more flavor (garlic powder, salt, pepper) because with this 'cheese' alone, you don't get much flavor.If you want a good cheese flavor, use real cheese or buy the packaged M&C.; If you want cheese color, this is your product."
1,False advertising!,I'm so tired of false advertising on Amazon! And fake reviews! This stuff is mostly whey and a very small amount of cheddar and also contains two food dies!!! It's crap!! And your site advertising it as dried cheddar! I'm almost to the point of leaving Amazon for good!
1,Don't buy this product,"This product claims to have a range of 100 feet. It WILL NOT WORK at approximately 30 feet! It works OK up to 30 feet.The manufacturer should receive lawsuits when this device does not perform a medical alert and someone suffers or dies when they wait for someone to respond to pushing the medical alert device.At 30 feet, you don't need this almost useless device."
1,Doesn't work as described,"Range is only 50 ft, not 100 ft, even with new batteries. First shipment was lost and it took them 3 weeks to send out another one. Poor customer service. Communication via email only and takes 2 days to reply. No telephone number to call."
4,Culturally Informative,"The biggest value that I received from this work was insight into some of Tibetan culture, which for me provided valuable context for deciphering what aspects of the meditation instruction I am receiving is cultural hangover and what parts are universal. If you are practicing a Tibetan form, I think this book provides a nice reality check of how you should be spending your energy as a western practitioner.The book loses a star for being a bit slow at times, but hey, its about a guy's life, you can't expect it to be a hollywood script."
4,splendid,"There are lots of inspiring life stories of great yogis of the past. They lived hundreds of years ago in circumstances far beyond our imagination. Therefore it all may seem as a fairy tale. In this book an eye witness writes about the life of great yogis living in, or close to our times. See for yourself the unfolding possibilities when you start working with your mind."
5,best gift ever,"I bought this for my husbands Christmas present, for his collection, he loved it! Almost brought tears to his eyes. Pepper mill was beautiful, as described and arrived before Christmas, as promised!"
1,Returned Item but Still No Refund,I returned this item and it was received over 3 weeks ago. Still no refund from the company. The picture is of the cage ball but in reality it is only the bladder. Will not order from this company again.
4,Good recording - not great.,"The recording of the Requiem on this CD leaves much to be desired. The choir is quite good but the organ accompaniment is overpowering. The poorly balanced bass drones ruin the Requiem's last movement - one of the most serene musical moments of 20th century. I think the orchestral accompaniment is much nicer. As for the other pieces, I would say they are well done. Ubi Caritas is nice but I wish that more of the other vocal parts would come out more with the alto melody. The tenor harmony part is beautiful-if you can hear it. Overall, the CD is a good introductory recording for Maurice Durufle's choral works."
3,No title,Unfortunately I thought it was the bigger version. But the product is still quite useful. It arrived within the stated time period. I was happy about that.
1,Iowa Hawkeye Dog Collar,"After waiting 2 weeks for my purchase of a dog collar, I was forced to email the seller and they informed me they were out of stock but forgot to email to tell me. Seller then said that it would be approximately 10 days until the dog collar would be able to be shipped, I've waited 20 days and have not heard a thing. I have tried to contact the seller on 3 different occasions, but I have yet to get a straight answer from them. I would discourage anyone from using them due to their terrible customer service."
3,very good quality,good price good quality. only bad thing was i purchased this item for an official Wii pink remote and the color of the strap was a lighter color pink. Works great never the less.
4,It's a wrist strap,It works and is a light pink color. Pretty simple you just attach it to your wii. Really can not come up with 20 words to describe this item. If you need a wrist strap this will work great for you. Unless of course you are a man that does not like pink! Can't go wrong with this buy!
2,no snap,"it doesnt have a snap close strap so when you tighten it, it can just loosen right up...other than that its almost exactly what i thought i was ordering"
4,Kurt Kinetic Riser Ring,"I bought this product about a month ago and have used it numerous times. It does its job by keeping your tire in place and elevating it slightly. I think it works best when you have some sort of training mat underneath the riser ring; it makes it less wobbly. It's cheap, but not cheaply made; I think the plastic is pretty well made and have had no problems with it thus far. I do recommend this product. Thanks for reading."
5,Riser ring works well,It works perfectly with my trainer. It levels out my bike and provides good stability. It is essential for using the trainer.
2,Buy the Swivel Riser for Rock n Roll Trainer,"Kinetics recommends using the Swivel Riser for use with the Rock n Roll trainer. Unfortunately Amazon suggests a bundle that includes the ""Fixed Riser"". This trainer is designed to move and as such the fixed riser in the wrong accessory for the Rock n Roll trainer."
2,Pretty bulky for its purpose,"For its simple purpose this riser is pretty huge. It does its job very well but in my opinion it takes up too much space. Going to create my own riser (it's not really a complicated contraption) that fits my bike perfectly and takes up much less space. But if you got plenty of storage room to spare then hey why not, it's a damn stable riser it can have that."
5,Very stable,The product arrived very quickly and in great condition. It goes great with another product that allows my to ride my road bike in the house during bad weather. The kinetic fixed riser keeps my front tire very secure.
3,not needed for me; maybe for you,"i've got a 2011 cannondale badboy solo, XL frame; stock 700c tires. my kinetic road machine lifts the back wheel only about 1.25"". there's no need for a >$20 riser for this very slight rise on such a large bike. will return. ymmv."
5,Great product!!!,"Very good for your bike, I can move it to different inclination levels, very compact, small does not take a lot of space, easy to use."
2,Unhappy,"I have used this product for a couple years now. Unfortunately the product has changed since I last bought it. My wife and I used to apply it only once and it was great for a long time. Now we had to use it three times because it keeps drying out. I guess they changed some of the ingredients in it so people would have to use it several times in a love making session, therefore having to order it more often. We will look to find a product that works well with one application not three."
5,Not like anything else,"I have used a couple types of lubrication with my toys and this is super. If you are not having such a good experience with that hot moment, then try this. It is very slippery and so far for me it does not get sticky. I recommend experimenting with the amount you use. For me a small amount lasts for some time. You be the judge. You'll enjoy those hot moments the first time you use it."
5,Fantastic product,I love this stuff. Works very well. Wife loves it as well. We use it a lot. And the shipping on it was extremely fast.
2,Works,"Like the title says it works but its nothing special, has some unwanted ingredients as well. Gun oil H2O is better, KY ultragel was better, but it does work. Basing this off of it doesn't last that long and it's messier than other brands.(m/f couple)"
5,Excellent performance,"The lube stays slick, doesn't smell unpleasant, and keeps perfectly well in a smaller container, like a prescription bottle (reuse and recycle). This first foray into water based lubricants is a pleasant change from the traditional lube."
2,tacky not silky,"was in the market for a new item in this area and thought i would try. other reviews were positive and took their words for endorsement. have not found product to be ""silk like"" at all. lube is on the tacky side. dries fast and requires reapplication much more frequently then the other products i have used. would not purchase again. also pump style bottle is great for home but makes traveling out of the question as to close bottle it is small feat!"
5,An excellent product,"I bought this here because the company I previously purchased from stopped carrying it. I have been using this particular type of lubricant for several years now and cannot say enough positives about it. This is an excellent all purpose lubricant that mimics the texture of natural body fluids (so that things don't feel artificial). It also does not get sticky as it dries out, which is very nice. Very easily water soluble so clean up is quick and easy. It is a very gentle blend which does not irritate sensitive tissues at all. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs this sort of product."
3,An OK product.,"For the amount that you get, this lube is not bad, but nor is it very good. It seems similar to a KY Jelly, except in cream/lotion form. It dries rather quickly and becomes sticky. It does, however, reactivate if water is applied to it, (but during sex, applying water can be troublesome)."
3,eh,"I'm very sensitive. this stuff burned me. I tried it cause I got a free sample, it was alright, but it burned, and irritated me. also it got sticky quickly and didn't really work.I usually use Pjur Eros Woman Bodyglide 100ml. and honestly I very much enjoy this alot more."
3,OK,I never use this kind of product but we've been needing something to help so I thought I'd try this after reading all the positive reviews. I've only used it 2x but so far it's ok. It does sort of burn my parts a bit which I don't like so I may have to find something else but for now I'll use what I have unless it get worse. If you are very sensitive then maybe a different product would work better.
5,Best lube ever,"My girlfriend and I tried a lot of lubes before we found this one. They all had their various problems, and many of them caused her physical pain. Liquid Silk was a lifesaver and we never even thought about using another one after this. Would give 6 stars if I could."
4,"Powerful dust collector, but cumbersome bag change","I originally thought the remote was a worthless frill, but now I think it is a great asset. It lets you stretch out the hose and remotely turn it on when needed at the planer or table saw. It has no problem keeping up with my 15"" planer at full blast.Con: Changing the dust bag is a pain. I think that there could be an easier way to change this, which isn't a problem when its empty, but it is a pain when its full. Therefore, I recommend a cyclone type unit to catch your big chuncks and reduce bag changes. I made one out of a 50 gallon plastic garbage can, and the collector still has no problem pulling through the can and 20' of hose. I would buy this again."
1,An extraordinary waste of the writer's effort.,"How or why should America's extreme right wingers need their language interpreted? Speaking as a Centre-right wing Brit I find the concept of such a book utterly bemusing.One might even wonder why anyone would want to write 820 pages on the decline of state militias between the War of Independence and the Civil War!If M. Pitcavage finds it amusing to dish out ""Lone Star"" reviews, then others can do the same."
4,Short Game But Very Fun,Only by this game if it is for the kids. This was a somewhat challenging game but I beat this game in about 6 hours. Very beautiful and the animation is great. Just don't plan on spending hours and hours on end playing this game.
4,How cute!,"That was my first thought when I saw this cuddly little guy in the video store. I rented it and when it was due back, I was into it, so I bought it. Some parts can confuse you while you're staring right at the obvious, you get to surf on a log, and did I mention the cuteness? Of course you get to collect things and you don't get past every area or boss without a little thought, admiration at the scenery, going back for something, and a fatality or two trying to reach those nasty collectables. When the game is ""over"", your quest continues in collecting. I wish the Klonoa (1) before this wasn't so rare, and I would really like a third one with some more platform roamability.Definitly get this. You can replay the levels over again without starting over."
2,Not Really Good.,"I have to be honest I hate childish games,they are so annoying and sometimes too cute for me. But this game is some what fun there is nothing really to unlock just to play the game and finish it.I only play it because I am just so damn bored. This game is only good for girls or boys that are below the age of 11, well that is what I think I really don't care if you buy it or not I am just saying think twice before u waste your money you might regret it later on. It's an alright game."
2,"Good for kids, but too easy....","This game would be fine for kids age 5-12, but I was dissapointed by how easy the game is. Also, I don't understand why everyone is saying the graphics are wonderful. They seem pretty mediocre to me. They are very jagged and very simplistic. I've seen better graphics on some PS One games. Again, great for young kids, but not for anyone with gaming skill."
2,"Too Short,Too Easy,Not fun at all!","Poeple are saying that this game is too easy and too short.But they also say it's fun!What type of game is easy and short yet fun?I don't quite understand.I would much rather have a game that made me want more.A game that takes more than just one day to play.I don't see how this simple childish game can appeal to anyone.Although I might be wrong,[not!]chow-dig!"
1,Wake me up when it's over,"I like all kinds of games: adventure, RTS, RPG, FPS, platformer, and a variety of cross-genre games. For example, I thoroughly enjoyed Rogue Squadron, Red Alert, Age of Empires, Zelda games, Metal Gear Solid and so on. However, one thing that I consistently like is the feeling of freedom in a game. Game developers have to think about the limits of the console and the goal of the game, but...I played about 4 hours of it and thought this game [...stunk]. Boring gameplay, virtually no feeling of freedom (2-D), and that irritating nonsensical language. I do have the odd feeling, though, that if you like anime, that you might like this game. I don't personally like anime, but the bosses and characters sure gave me the feeling that those types of folks might get a kick out of this game."
4,Beautiful graphics,"This game is so pretty. The settings and game play are super creative. It's a dream game for youngsters. Klonoa does speak in Japanese however, as it is a Japanese game, (They do translate it). If you're nosy and like to know what people are saying at all times this might annoy you."
5,LOVE THIS GAME,"I HAVEN'T PLAYED VIDEO GAMES SINCE BEING A YOUNG PERSON (ATARI)AND I RECEIVED THIS GAME ON A JAM PACK BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT I COULD PLAY - PS2 HAS ALOT OF SPORTS. SO WHEN I PLAYED THIS GAME, WHICH IS EXCITING AND AT TIMES CHALLENGING IT IS A GOOD GAME FOR THE ""NOT SO MUCH SPORTS"" AT HEART.I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING IT."
3,Not Enough Detail,"Although this book is a good overview of QA requirements in our industry, it is limited in detail. I hope the authors will put more application information in next time. I would have liked to have seen examples --- none here."
3,The IBM 300GL Desktop,"The IBM 300GL Desktop (300-MHz Pentium II, 64 MB RAM, 4 GB hard drive)is a light weight Desktop computer with plenty of power and additional hardware (two USB ports, protecting front panel)to handle upgrades with ease. The 300MHz works fast and well on the net and with most programs. The only problem was the lack of motherboard software and software for video and sound. These drivers are very basic and are easy to optain on the internet. With all things considered this buy is worth the money."
2,Do not last,I bought these (or similar Feit brand) at HD or Lowe's. They claim 2000 hours average life. Ridiculous. I'm getting maybe 3 months as the above comment also notes. This is in a brand new fixture. No other choices at the big boxes. Glad to see other choices on Amazon and external ads. Will try something else.
5,delicious,Just very good food bar. If I craving for chocolate I eat this instead. This is can be your breakfast too.Highly recommended.
5,Good Snack Bar,"I really enjoy these bars. They are filling, not overly sweet, have a good amount of protein, but still have the chocolate taste I love. They also do not have any milk products in them, which I try to avoid, and that is difficult to find with chocolate. This is not a good bar for low calories though, so check the label. I would recommend buying a single bar at a local store to make sure you like the taste before you buy so many, but this is a better price than in any store I have found."
1,Disgusting + Burnt,This tastes like something you would scrap off the button of a burnt pot. It's extremely dry and has a charred/burnt taste. Not pleasant.Try a Clif bar instead.
5,Good Stuff!!!,"These bars have good flavor and aren't full of all the fake ingredients most bars have. Quality bars, worth buying."
4,Very good :),"These bars are really chewy and have a great texture. They did start to get a little boring after eating them for breakfast several days in a row, but they are still great as long as I mix things up every once in a while."
5,wonderful,they taste like you're eating an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie instead of a healthy protein bar.
3,OK in a pinch,"Bought a couple of these for a management training event, where there were to be breakout sessions. Functions as described, but really should come with more sheets. Price per sheet is high, and the easel is really not reusable."
3,what I needed,"Just what I needed for my craftroom Functions as I expect it to, easy to set up and easy to hang."
5,"Sublime, historic.","In a recent PBS interview, Tony Bennett cited this album, among so many classics, as his favorite. He said the reason was because all the movie theme songs on this album were arranged by each individual composer. In this cd, Bennett is at the peak of his vocal form and is working (as mentioned) with each different well-known composer on each song he sings. The results are what I consider to be a long buried treasure of brilliantly performed movie themes. If you have an ounce of romance left in your body, this cd is gonna kill ya!"
4,Comprehensive Analysis,"I found this analysis of Song of Solomon very helpful. I've used this text in both my high school and college freshman level literature classes. MaxNotes doesn't presuppose the reader has a literary background and therefore makes sure to define literary terms, giving examples in order to establish a literary lexicon. However, the author also is erudite in the wide spectrum of literary criticism written on Solomon. The book does a good job of approaching the text from the standpoint of both gender and class as well as race issues. If you have a literary background you can ignore the basics but don't miss the valuable analysis and solid bibliography the author provides."
2,at least it worked,"This product worked, but I was not very happy with what else it did. Make sure you research the side effects before you purchase this item."
1,Did Nothing For Me,I purchased this for fungus on my thumb. I used it everyday for 2 weeks twice a day.This product did absolutely Nothing. If fact the brush that comes with it is so soft that it had no effect.
1,Truly offensive,"Although this book is barely more expensive than a cup of coffee, I wish I'd gone for the coffee instead.If you are deeply religious you may find comfort in this book that talks more about the scripture than about relationships. Offers very little practical information relative to almost any other book on the topic that I've encountered; suggests following the ""Word of God"" no matter what the cost."
4,Very good resource,"You should be aware that this book is heavily religous and gets quite preachy at times. Also, it is an extremely small/short book. That all being said--although I am an atheist, I found its general message inspirational, and much of its practical advice very useful."
4,A breath of fresh air,"Great book, small but effective. If you've been left or somehow find yourself the only half of the marriage wanting to save it; and believe that there's still a chance ( even if small), please read- it will help you remain sain, keep you from making a few mistakes, and give you some great advice."
3,Good But Short On Substance,This book was good and gave very helpful advice; however it can be read in less than a half an hour due to the small number of pages.
2,Good for die-hard Christians,"This is a very short, small book, which is not a problem, only something buyers should be aware of. Its message mostly sees to be encouragement to stay in a marriage, keeping faith in God. It attempts to justify everything with the Bible, including scripture references in seemingly every other sentence (FAR more than the excerpt would lead you to believe). For those of us who do not believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of god and the sole source of authority, it's so off-putting that it makes it hard to get at the author's message."
1,simplistic,"Ed Wheat completely overlooks the possibility that someone may be in an abusive situation. Reading this book in a marriage that contains any form of abuse, emotional, verbal, financial or physical could intensify the already painful patterns. Abused women already carry too much responsibility for the marriage. My wish is that the indicators of abuse were clearly stated so that if abuse were present the reader could turn to more effective methods of resolving their difficulties."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is not worth purchasing! I am in the middle of a divorce and I purchased this book and ""Divorce Remedy"" by Michele Weiner Davis. Her book is much more readable and applicable today. Dr. Wheat's recommendation to get back a walk-a-way wife is totally opposite Michele Weiner Davis'. His recommendation is sure to ruin your marriage. It's a good thing I read Michele's book first and implemented her ideas as I would already be divorced if I used Dr. Wheat's. Don't, Don't use his methods, they won't work."
2,"Some good stuff, but too much burden on the faithful spouse","This book has some helpful points, but there are many others that incorporate the concept of ""boundaries"" and ""Tough Love"". (Townsend and Cloud, James Dobson, Willard Harley). I think if you just follow Dr. Wheat's advice, you will become a perpetual doormat. This isn't what God intended. The Proverbs woman was not a wimp, and we are not called to lay down on our backs and wait to be stepped on. Love Must Be Tough is better."
4,Good Inspiration,"Obviously your marriage will not be saved without the leaver, but the process can begin by yourself (and if you don't call on God and the spouse doesn't, it'll never be reconciled.)"
1,Horrid little book,"First of all, the advice in this book is just wrong. Wheat says if you refuse to ""sign anything,"" your spouse won't be able to divorce you. Not in the United States! He pretends to be all Bible-believing, but it is the sort of cultish belief that 20/20 did an expose on: ""Independent Fundamental Baptists"" and such. It is a short book, and has an extended passage from Hosea, one of the Bible's minor prophets, who was married to a prostitute. Do yourself a favor and watch Oprah, read the book of Hosea, whatever - can't be worse than this."
5,Don't give up!,"I read this book after seeing two counselors who only wanted to prepare me for life after divorce. They were not interested in saving my marriage. This spiritual approach to saving marriages probably saved my life. I had hope for the first time in many months. While we are not divorced, my husband has not entered into a reconciliation with me. However, as a result of this book, I learned some practical, biblical actions I could take to have chance at saving my marriage. Eighteen months later, he is still here with our children. I pray for the restoration of my marriage. This book (and the bible)are my best chances of that happening."
4,"Great excerpt of ""Love life for Married Couples""","This book is two chapters from his other book ""Love life for Married Couples."" It was a great motivation to hang in there when things get tough. I bought the other book, too, and it is excellent. I was ready to give up, but I was motivated by reading to hang in there. It doesn't suggest being trampled on forever. But, by showing patience and kindness, you can open the spirit of your mate who wants to leave. Then, you can work out your problems once you can get your mate to WANT to work things out. This is a good start for people who feel that there is no hope and that trying to save their marriage is a lost cause. A better title would be ""How to begin the process of saving your marriage alone and pursuade your mate to join you"""
5,You'll wear out the pages!,"I purchased this ""little"" book about three weeks ago and I can not put it down. I have lost count of the times that I have read and re-read it's pages. It is not a very long book but it is jammed full of information! Each time I read it, something new and inspriring pops out at me! If you are looking for a ""Help me!"" book that is faith based, buy it!"
3,Wish there were more to it.,"Book was much smaller then anticipated, but did contain some good insights. I wish the author would have added more material to the subject"
3,Short but to the point,"This is a hard pill to swallow. The book is short, read it in less than 2 hours. There is a lot in it about cheating spouses so if that's not where you need help and enlightenment, this may not be your book. The author hits upon his other material, the name evades me, which may help understand where he's going with this little book. There's better options out there for helping a bad situation but this little book will help establish a good baseline to battle back with love. Be prepared for rejection."
4,Track Listing,"1. The Wonderful Go-Go2. The Computer No. 33. I'll Never Whistle4. Experimental Girl5. Only ""I Love You""6. The Fragile Glass7. To The Direction Of The Wind8. When The Sky Gets Sad9. I Never Came Once10. The Result Everlasting"
5,Favorite new artist/album-instant classic!!!,"Andrew Heilprin is SUCH a fantastic singer/songwriter. Amazing voice combined with awesome music and lyrics. Every song has a different vibe so there's no boredom from monotony like I experience with a lot of albums and the production quality is top notch. My husband and I feel lucky to have discovered this gem (thru KCRW) early on. We get to listen to him NOW before waiting for the rest of the world to catch up. This is the kind of CD you want to buy multiples of - so you can listen to it at home, in the car, and at work. An instant classic for our collection. It really is THAT good."
4,Great for practice,These swords look great and feel great. The only downside is you cannot practice at full strength because they will break very easy. Great for just footwork and technique training.
2,History without people,"The history courses that I took many years ago in NY schools discussed slavery mostly in the context of Southern plantations. I bought this book hoping to learn about the workings of slavery in my native state. I was very disappointed. On first opening the book, I was astonished to note that the name ""Sojourner Truth"" is not in the index. I soon realized that Dr. McManus is one of those historians who prefers his history without any people cluttering it up. He has produced a work filled with dates, numbers, laws, statistics and footnotes. But almost all trace of individual slaves and masters has been left out of his version of the history of slavery in NY."
1,Royal Inexacta nonscale,"Save your money. This is the worst scale I have ever used. It switches from weighing items to the tare function on a whim, or shuts off randomly, or items weigh differently depending on the pull of the moon. Please do not give this company any money, I know I won't."
1,Should have known.....,"... when the product was produced by Royal. Thankfully I got this at Costco, so it is going back! What a horrid scale. Actually, it is a joke to even call it a scale. As others said, the numbers bounce around wildly, it doesn't come back to 0 when I remove an item (and that is not due to the tare feature)."
5,Dylan at his Best,"While I flip-flop on the issue, today I consider this Dylan's finest album. When I first heard it back in the 70's, I considered the electric side dated and amateurish. Any pre-Hendrix guitar work was always going to sound behind the times, and it was just too - well, lo-fi! But the circle has turned, and lo-fi is in again, and this album miraculously sounds better than ever. The acoustic side, though, is the true miracle, with two of Bob's best-ever songs, ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and ""It's Alright Ma."" If you've only heard the Byrds' version of Tambourine Man, you haven't heard the song. Nobody but Dylan can write songs that can be tough and tender at the same time, and he never did it better than right here."
5,a classic story of escape and survival in war time Holland,"John Hackett was rescued in more ways than one after the failure of an airborne assault on Arnhem in Holland in September 1944. He spent around four months in the care of the Dutch resistance recovering from his wounds and hiding from the German army. The Dutch people are shown to have remarkable qualities of resilience, friendliness and community and family. Hackett mentions how he chose to abort one escape attempt. If only the same decision making skills had been shown before ""Market Garden""? Hackett also makes a brief mention of Montgomery, perhaps in reconciliation."
3,A Good Try,"After reading this book I would not recommend it to the military professional or the enthusiast. While the cover gives the indication of a fully detailed accounting of all major armored vehicles that have served or are in service, the author lets his readers down in a number of different areas. First although a very large number of vehicles are covered, information on each is scant. Secondly there are no pictures or illustrations of the different armored vehicles covered. And lastly the organization of the book leaves alot to be desired. It appears haphazard and the breakdown between tanks, tracked apc's, wheeled apc's etc... is at best confusing. In summation it was a worthy attempt but in the end this book misses the mark."
1,Hmmm,"Not very impressed. This same coat is on sale at Macy's, so I tried it on before purchasing. I found a pea coat of much better quality at Old Navy (simply shocking since their quality took a nose dive long ago). It looks good, but the fabric isn't at all what I expect of a good wool coat."
4,It's worth the money,I like this coat for the price. it looks nice and feels nice. it doesn't fit AMAZINGLY but what would you expect for a hundred bucks? it does fit well though. definitely looks better than it costs! I recommend it.
3,"Nice, but you're paying for the name; not warm enough","The sale price of around $100 should be the list price. The list price of $250 is seriously inflated. It's a nice jacket; the wool is soft and there is a quilted lining, but it's also thinner than expected and just not enough insulation. I bought this for my boyfriend who already has a peacoat but wanted another that would be warmer for New York City winters. This coat does not fit the bill. He is broad-shouldered and has a 46"" chest and 36"" waist, usually wears a Large or Extra Large. We ordered the Large and it fits fine everwhere except the shoulders where it's tight so he can't lift his arms up. The buttons are also kinda wimpy for a peacoat; his current army/navy-thrift-shop-bought-peacoat has larger, better secured buttons. If you live someplace where winters don't get super cold (or if you're in the car a lot), this coat should be fine. Make sure to get the buttons reinforced and don't pay more than the sale price."
1,Don't buy for replacement in Fujitsu N3010 laptop... it just won't work!,"I purchased this battery for a replacement of FPCBP70 in my N3010 laptop. It never charged up, and battery status indicator was blinking red,,, which indicates 'problem with battery'.I called Brilliant Store and arranged for an RMA#, and sent this battery back within a few days. Upon receiving the second battery, two weeks after Brilliant Store received the 1st battery, I plugged it in, having plenty of time to fully charge, encountering the same problems and battery status. Completely dead on arrival, and computer will not start up, however my original battery still works but lasts only 5 min. on a full charge.Brilliant Store was very helpful and sent 2nd RMA#, and is in process of issuing a refund on the purchase.PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS DEKCELL AS A REPLACEMENT FOR A N3010 LAPTOP!"
5,Disney's Crowning Achievement,"Gargoyles, for its all too brief run on TV, was the pinnacle of Disney animation on television. And it wasn't just beautiful art and superb voice direction that made this series amazing- it was a storyline with such complexity and balance that you'd never imagine it was aimed at children.But Gargoyles succeeded with both children and adults- it always brandished its dichotomy with skill and finesse. Shakespearean plots worked alongside puns and sight gags, all aimed to keep every single viewer bound up in the fascinating and often thought-provoking mythos of the Gargoyles.This DVD is the first chance Gargoyles fans have had to own these episodes since their original VHS release in 1996, and if this set sells well, Disney is sure to provide us with the chance to buy the even more amazing Second season!Show your support for Gargoyles, and add an incredible piece of animation history to your collection at the same time."
3,disappointed with manufacter error,I am sadly returning this set. On disc one all the episodes are not there. You won't notice unless you put in the disc and watch with your kids. I love the series but I paid for all of it not part of it.
3,"Wonderful series, but, disney....","While I have loved gargoyles since it first aired on TV, I am tired of disney's tactics on selling their products. Everytime they need money or try to boost sales its the same ""Its going into the vault"" or ""If we dont make $1.5 mill on a dvd we are not going to bother with our customers"" Im sure its like that with many companies but Im tired of the blackmail from disney specifically.This time 2 years ago, they put bambi in the vault, only to re-release it and make it a ""special edition"" and send it BACK into the vault along with Narnia. Then with the sad attempts to make sequels and ruin perfectly good storylines? Cinderella 3???? WTH was THAT!?While I do love the gargoyles series, If they choose not to release it,then I will just download it."
3,Gargoyles,I like Gummi Bears. I hope they be on DVDI want on DVDDuck TalesChip 'n' Dale RRGummi BearsTale SpinThe WuzzlesDarkwing DuckMighy Ducks (cartoon)
5,The Best TV series by Disney,"Seriously. Gargoyles mixes the best of everything; right down to Shakespear and Arthurian legend. It brings to life characters such as MacBeth, Puck, Oberon, Titania, and takes you from modern-day Manhattan to medieval Europe, Avalon, and Ireland; even the possible future our heroes face. It provides excellent voice acting by well-known personalities such as Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, and John Rys Davies; and that's only a few. The animation is beautiful and flowing. Without a doubt, old-school Gargoyles owns."
5,Awesome series with a great story line.,"I absolutly love this series. Unlike most cartoon series, this one actually has a continuing story plot from episode to episode. This truly is a masterpiece and I will definitly purchase all the other seasons of this great show."
5,Finally!!!,"I am glad they finally are putting these out on dvd! These shows are the best I can't wait to collect them all. I was a little disappointed that the ""1000 years ago"" theme wasn't on here and it would have been nice to have each episode divided into chapters, but it's much better than the version that my sister and I did trying to tape them off tv and cut out the commercials and put them in order."
5,AWESOME,"Finally can throw away my worn vhs taped versions.Awesome series, Disney get your skates on and release seasons 2 and 3 please.A series and release worthy of every accolade thrown at it.COME ON DISNEY AND Buena Vista - SERIES 2 and 3 please"
5,The ghosts of my past ReAwaken,"This Series has influenced me in more ways than I can elaborate. When I was young (I was 11 when Gargoyles Premiered)I Watched this for the first time. From that time on the plots have haunted me. There is not a day that goes by that my thoughts do not stray back to those stories.It influenced the way I write. I consistently get A's and B's on College papers because I have the voice and Vocabulary of Goliath to trace.It changed the way I looked at Cinema(even though it never aired on the big silver screen). I now demand a higher standard in entertainment.It sparked a curiosity in Mythology, Shakespeare, and Classic literature.It is one of the Cornerstones of my past and I put it there for a reason. The reason is that the Gargoyles is tied for the best Animated Series I have ever seen(The Transformers is the other one yes Gargoyles is that good)."
4,Gargoyles on the go,"I recently bought this dvd set for my husband. We took it on our vaction for the kids to watch on the road. I will never take a long road trip without it. It was a great purchase, and when the second season comes out I will buy that as well."
5,"Profound, insightful, and animated!","I grew up with Gargoyles, and I have never forgotten the vital lessons this remarkably profound and deep show taught me about friendship, prejudice, violence, and doing what is right. Gargoyles is truly a one of a kind show, and I cannot possibly express how delighted I am that it has finally come out on DVD (without jumping up and down and breaking things, that is). This incredible show is funny, romantic, sad, thought provoking, and action packed. It is all of these at once, and on a higher cognitive level, too. Ask anyone in my generation who had a television, and they will remember this gem. Once you've experienced Manhatten through an ancient Gargoyle's eyes, you will too."
5,Best Disney animated show...EVER!,"Gargoyles is without a doubt the most engaging and captivating animated series that Disney has ever commited to the small screen. A fantastic drama mixed with just the right amount of comdey and sensitivity to draw you in and keep you there. 10 years later, we are still talking about it! Disney poorly handled the series in its last season (3rd to be exact. ""The Goliath Chronicles"", it was called if anyone wants to avoid its foul stench) and was cancelled. If anyone even considers buying this DVD they are on the right track. The more DVDs purchased the more likely Disney will be to release the rest of the episodes, and there are some mighty powerful ones that occur after the first season, let me tell you! Gargoyles broke new ground, and was taken off the air FAR too early, so show your support, or interest, and buy this DVD. You will not be dissapointed!"
5,Set in Stone goodness,"Gagoyles was undoubtedly the finest animated serie ever produced by Disney and by far one of the most original. Nothing they ever produced before or to date matches it in its quality. With an incredibly talented, incredibly well known voice cast and beautiful character designs and animation it's no wonder the series took off and tragically it was cancelled in its peak (probably for being TOO good.) If you haven't seen this before then I suggest you sit down and watch an animation that rivals prime time television with ease.Draconis Mk IV"
5,Season 1 Gargoyles,"This cartoon was an is unlike any other produced by Disney or anyone else for that matter. It's content is truly unique, and encompasses Shakespeare, real history, mythology, and has continuing plotlines and amazing characters. It's appropriate and enjoyable for any age, from child to adult. It has a strong moral message but doesn't browbeat you with it. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Ahh, Nostalgia!","The great thing about this DVD is that it has the commentary, though if you haven't seen the show yet, watch it without the commentary, Mr Weisman and company give a few little spoilers away in there, but it's all good... the only thing that i've noticed is the slight sound quality issue... now, i'm running it on m PC, so that could be why it's like that, but the sound fades ever so slightly once or twice in a couple episodes...other than that, it is a great disc, i'll likely watch it a few times again and hope for the Season 2 DVD to come out soon."
5,perfect,"this is one of the greatest series, along with batman: the animated series (a clear influence in the gargoyles series). the episodes are great; the extras area great; the dvd set arrived in perfect condition. thank you!"
5,Amazing Show,"""Gargoyles"" is bar none the finest American cartoon to ever grace the television screen. I've often wondered what Disney was thinking in not renewing Greg Weisman's contract; apparently they didn't like his style. Too adult. He's even said that the show would have been even darker if Disney had let it get there. This is one that should be owned by everyone that appreciates great cartoons."
2,Kindle version maps unreadable,"The content of the book is quite helpful, however, the maps do not 'zoom' enough to be readable. I have a couple of Lonely Planet travel guides whose zoom feature works properly so I assume that the problem resides with the book and not the Kindle."
2,Disappointing,"This is a good video for the first time owner. I was disappointed that there wasn't more insight as to how the donkey thinks or interacts or even more history as an opening. The description of the different sizes I think should have been at the begining instead of toward the end. I am a long time horse person who has trained and did not learn a single thing new. What information is on the dvd can be easily found for free via internet searches.On the plus, Crystal Ward is very clear is not a little too talkative on her process and things going on with what she is instructing. For the beginner it would be great, for the more knowledgable...look further."
4,difficult workout,This DVD is a difficult workout and was way to strenuous for an in shape middle- aged woman. It is geared for a younger woman.
5,Never thought a light weight would feel so heavy!,"Michelle has a unique approach to strength training. A lot packed into a small amount of time. Weights with bands, good instruction. Be sure to use a long enough band when you do these."
3,A bit too easy,"Although I really like Michelle, I'm a very experienced workout fanatic, who mostly does videos at home. This workout was way too easy for me and I didn't feel challenged at all."
3,New or Used ???,"When I opened the box, I wasn't 100% sure this item was new. It was wadded up and taped into a mass so it would fit into the box. I honestly cannot imagine this item being new and sent in such a manor. Also, a foot pump would have been a real asset. Most balls of such size include this tool, so this was a dissapointment. How are you supposed to blow it up with the hole being flush with the ball? (No instructions either.) More work than I bargained for. All in all, the ball is good, no holes, holds air well."
1,Pops Easy,Worked great a couple of times - then popped by landing on a ladder ball set. A small plastic toy. Bigens was a much better product
1,"Hug'rs 50"" BIG GREEN BALL",What a joke! I DO NOT recommend this ball! I spent 73.00 with shipping and handling for a ball I thought would be at least somewhat durable...when I spend that kind of money on anything...I expect it to be quality product!! Not dollar tree quality. We had this ball for less than a week and it somehow just tore where the fold creases had been. It's gone. Down the drain. Worthless. $75.00. WTF!!! :(
4,Good Fun Set at a Good Price,"This Bocce Ball set is made of a semi-heavy plastic. They are not filled with water so you do not have to worry about puncturing them. However, because they are made of plastic, they will get scuffs in them as you play with them. The different colors are nice so you can easily tell everyone's throws apart. The size and weight are really nice for a family. They are not too light for adults, but they are light enough to be easy and safe for the younger ones to play along with. For the price this is a great set. It even comes in a nice nylon carrying bag that zips up and has handles."
1,Just plain terrible,"The first thing I did, after opening the brown cardboard box it was shipped in, was gently pick up the supplied red carrying bag by its handle. This ripped the bag wide open. The balls themselves are way lighter weight than any I have ever played with before (which might be okay for young kids, but not for me). This is the first item I will have ever returned to Amazon."
4,"Lighter than I'd like, but I sort of expected it","For the price, I give these a 4-star. I knew they would not be that heavy, but they're a little lighter than I had expected. Overall though, they're still fun and you don't have to spend $70 on them. I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't super serious about bocce ball but enjoys playing every once and a while."
4,Nice light weight set,"this is a great set for the not-so-serious bocce ballers. We have used it at the beach for one week and they held up well and I can see us getting a good amount of use from this set. The bag it came in, however, ripped after a few days use and we will have to find something else to store/transport them in."
3,"Good game set, horrible carrying case","I received my Bocce set just as described. The balls are great and work just as well as more expensive sets. However, the carrying case was ripped almost in half upon arrival. Be sure to check the entire package when your set arrives!"
4,Decent for the price,For about $20 it's a decent amount of fun that I can just leave in the trunk of my car and break out when the situation presents itself. Balls are pretty much as shown in the picture... nothing of really high quality but it's fine for casual bocce. The carrying bag probably won't last too long.
4,For Bocce Ball lovers!,Great set. Balls are well weighted and very durable. The bag is of low quality and will rip easily. The set will last much longer than the bag.
2,light set - lame bag,The bag with this set is garbage.It ripped the first time I picked it up - the material is closer to tissue paper than canvas.The set is quite light - but I knew that from other reviewers.At ~$20 it is likely to much trouble to return pay for shipping etc.So now I have a bunch of loose 90mm balls that likely will become disconnected from one another and/or lost.Resulting in $20 worth of garbage kicking around my house.Thanks for chintzing on the bag Halex - hope the extra .43 cents makes the difference for your employee bonus program.
1,"Works well, briefly...","As far as whisks for non-stick surfaces go, the silicone-encased wires are very flexible--a far cry from the hard, thick plastic whisks with only a few wires. They are ideal for non-stick surfaces except for one problem. The silicone is soft and not durable. After a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer, the silicone gets easily cut. The silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose. I have been very careful, but this works out to probably $2 each time I used it."

4,I'm sure the keyboard works fine...,"Don't make assumptions. I was referred to this keyboard after buying a Clie PEG-SJ22u. It doesn't work with this model. I've since come back and taken the time to read the full product description, which is accurate. I'm sure that this keyboard works fine with the models it is designed for, but be sure that you confirm that it works with your model before you buy. Amazon doesn't always direct you to accessories that work with your PDA. I assumed otherwise, and found out the hard way that I was wrong."
4,Works well,"I found this keyboard works well with the Clie. I use the 610 version, and only needed to download the latest software from targus to make it work. So make sure the CD that comes with the keyboard is the latest version. Good tactile feeling when typing."
4,Stowaway for Clie 710,"A must accessory for the on-the-go type. The keyboard is light and compact. Programmable shotcuts allow easy access to important information and applications on the handheld. Other Clie owners reported difficulties installing the application, but I had no problem. Stick the cd in your drive, install the software, hotsych, start typing. On the downside, the keyboard lays flat and is hard to touch type."
2,not as good as the one I had for a Palm Vx,"I bought this product to go with my Clié N760C (I was replacing my Palm Vx system), and expected the quality and speed of the keyboard to match (or outperform) that of my Palm system. It didn't! In fact, one of the developpers emailed me that the keyboard drivers are not yet technically compatible with the N760C. Its a great product, but even with the latest drivers, using either WordSmith (a great MS Word sync & write program - the best) or Documents to Go, it doesn't keep up with my typing speed, whereas my old Palm did. Go figure."
4,Tall Cake Dome Quite A Find,"These are great domes.....only problem is getting them in one piece! I ordered more than one, but have yet to get them all in one piece! The boxes are not marked fragile and the Post Office really handles them roughly! Even the cake dome box was mangled in one shipment. Amazon has been wonderful about replacements, but it's a mess to have to deal with the broken glass and big boxes that are ruined for any other use because of all the broken glass."
2,much taller than expected,"I bought this item because of the more gender-neutral color palette, the price, and the good reviews. We received it last night, and it's a bit of a monstrosity. It's taller than I expected. I don't like that the bins are just balanced in place without really seeming to be held in place at all by the support bars, and it's harder to get toys in and out of it than it looks. It doesn't hold as much as I expected, and it would be nice if there were screw covers to hide the metal screws on the white sides, which are visible. I am disappointed."
5,Great organizer for all the different toy shapes,This toy organizer is great for those little ones who enjoy grabbing their own toys and helps create language skills as my little girl sees and asks for her toys in the organizer. It was so easy to put together and sturdy enough that I don't fear it falling over on her even though it is not attached to the wall. The colors are great and the size of the boxes were about the expected size. No negatives thus far about this product.
5,Excellent Product,"I find this to be an excellent product. I do Play Therapy and decided I needed a way to put my toys on display. This was the ticket for me. It is sturdy and easy (even easier for an octopus) to assemble. Now, when a child client enters my office, the toys look back instead of having to be looked for. I know there are other manufacturers who offer similar products. I have no regrets with my purchase. The added bonus, for me, was no shipping charge due to the price of the product."
5,Great toy organizer!,"I really like this toy organizer. It fits a large number of toys. We currently have a family room/playroom combination, and the organizer has made a huge difference in keeping the place organized. The primary colors are great for both boys and girls and my 2.5 year old loves being able to access all of his things when he wants them. My friend has two of these at her house too. I only wish I'd bought it sooner!"
3,Broken Bin,It seems a great product for organizing our kids' crafting supplies and toys but one of the bins was broken and can't be used.
3,Not a sturdy shelf,"The shelf isnt sturdy, and when I try to tighten the screws they just keep spinning. There are more totes than the shelf is designed to handle no matter which way you lay them on there."
1,CHEAP,"Purchased this, and it arrived damaged. The packaging is horrible. After taking everything out of the package, upon further inspection every single one of the bins were all cracked and cheap. Not worth the $$!"
2,Misleading color of the table!!!!,"I just received the package today and haven't assembled it yet. I am so diappointed when I saw the darker color of the table. it is a lot darker than the picture. However, I did notice it is the same color of several of the pictures uploaded by other buyers. I went through all the review and am surprised by the fact that nobody complained about the color of the table. We got a series of ""natural"" color furniture for my son's play room. This table is a lot darker although it is labled as ""natural"" and the picture looks like ""natural"" just like the other stuff I bought. But the real color is so much darker and I am considering returning it."
3,"Item looks nice, shipping ABYSMAL!",I ordered this item a few weeks ago... still have not received it although I received an item from this same order 10 days ago. I am hoping the construction of the item is solid and worth the wait. In the meantime... a surprised and disappointed customer.
3,Great idea for organization!,"Very easy to put together. Tubs are very sturdy. The arms and rods could be made a little stronger. The tubs don't fit perfectly but overall it does the job,"
4,Exactly as expected,"Great little storage shelf. I was looking for something not so girly that one day I couldn't have another child get some use out of the item. Great shelf, exactly as anticipated. Sturdy enough, my nine month old can pull herself up using the bins but nothing to be unexpected from that age. Does not tip easily. Would recommend."
2,Bins much too small,"Four of the bins are a decent size; the other 8 are too small for toddler toys, unless all your child's toys are jacks or little action figures. Instead of so many bins, they should combine the 8 tiny ones into 4 normal-size bins. And overall, the whole until would be better if it were just a few inches wider. I don't know what kinds of toys they think kids have that would fit into those little bins."
5,Great for little ones,This toy organizer is great. Makes clean up easy. My little one loves seeing all the toys in the bins. He picks out a bin to play with and when he's done he'll actually put the toys back. Easy to assemble.
5,Perfect for sorting all the little baby stuff,"We use this in our nursery to sort all of our baby's little stuff and toys. It's a space saver and makes it easy to organize things like, rattles, small toys, bath stuff, pacifiers, CDs, etc. We plan on transitioning it as our baby gets older and using it for toys,"
3,It works for what it is,"I like that we can remove the bins, but putting the bins back has proved challenging for smaller hands, especially if they are filled. All in all it's a good product to keep things semi organized. It was very easy to put together and seems sturdy enough."
4,Fun toy organizer,I love this toy organizer. The colors are not too bright so it compliments nicely with other toys and furniture in kids bedroom. It makes toys easily accessible for kids and teaches them organizing skills early on. The structure is sturdy as well and it's easy to assemble. I would highly recommend this product.
1,DAMAGED,I JUST OPEN THE BOX PULLED THE BINS OUT THEY ARE CHIPPED AND CRACKED THE WOOD IS FAKE MADE FORM CARDBOARD AND PEELING AT THE BOTTOM RECEIVED IT YESTERDAY WANT TO RETURN IT FOR A NEW ONE. GOT IT FOR MY SON SO HE CAN LEARN ORGANIZATION I RATE IT AS POOR QUALITY
3,"Great Idea, but too small & not so sturdy","Great Idea, but too small & not so sturdy. For $60, I was expecting just a little more. Would I spend that much on one of these again--nope! The concept is great.. even the picture on line is good, but the bins are tight and small. You can only fit in SMALL toys as many reviews have already said. You still have to find something else for your bigger toys. Again, great concept--but not entirely what I desired to have for most of our Kids toys. This should go for 1/2 the price then I'd feel better, since it only takes care of 40% of the toys in our home :("
2,Item is damaged...,Received item on time. (One Star)All pieces were there. (One Star)Plastic Bins (large ones) are stuck together; cannot get them apart.One of the large bins (yellow one) is crackedTop corner of main piece is dented in.Would recommend if the item I received was not damaged.
5,Great organizer,"This is a nice organizer, very sturdy construction and a good size for most toys. Item shipped fast, receieved within 3 days. My kids (20 month old twins) love pulling their toys out and can clearly see what they want unlike the toy box it replaced."
5,Awesome!,Much sturdier than your typical kids furniture in a box type stuff. Super easy to put together. I had it together in about 10 mins with toddler interruptions! Worth every penny.
5,Toy organizer,Great toy organizer!! My 3 1/2 year old can easily see her toys & this is a great way to teach her to pick up and organize her own toys!! Love it!!!
5,love It,This has made toy storage so much easier! It was a breeze to put this together and my 2 year helped me. It is overall very sturdy and the bins are easy to remove and they are fairly deep so they are holding alot of stuff at my house.
5,It was a gift,"Gave it to grandchildren to organize their room. Shipped fast and packaged well, so I was very very happy with that."
3,Okay,Arrived with all of the bigger boxes stuck together and between my Marine husband and myself we COULD NOT get the boxes apart!!! They mustve gotten wedged together during shipping or packing. Not cool.
4,Good organizer,This organizer is colorful and does the job. One problem with this organizer is that it is not easy to access the boxes in the 2nd and below rows easily. You have to lift the box above to be able to remove the one below.Some of the boxes were broken in the original shipment. So I had to get them replaced but I wish they had shipped just the replacement boxes and not the entire organizer the 2nd time.
2,broken bin,"I ordered the toy bin as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old daughter. However, when we opened the package, one of the bins were cracked and broken. I will only be buying items in store from now on. It's too much of a hassle to return for a new one."
4,"Sturdy, attractive toy bin set","I love the item itself. The only downside is that one of the bins was cracked when we opened the box. It wasn't noticed until the shelves were put together, so it wasn't worth taking apart to send back for a new one. Other that that, the bins really helped organize my niece's playroom, especially all the little things like miniature animals and cars. Would purchase item again."
5,Great product and price,"I was looking ofr a cheap storage alternative for basement toys and this was it! It is dueable, sturdy, cute and overall a good product for a great price!"
5,organizador,"Facil de montar, cabe em qualquer cantinho, ajuda as crianas a guardar os proprios brinquedos. Cabe bastante coisa, e excelente"
2,"Junky Construction, bins do not rest snugly as pictured","The plastic bins don't really ""set"" down between the bars as shown in the picture - they sort of precariously balance on the bars and slip down, fall over, and have gaps between them. This is a good concept but if you actually put any toys in the bins without expertly balancing them the bin just falls out.So not real useful if you are trying to make it easy for your children to get out and pick up toys. Also, this same item is on sale at Aldi for less than half the price - still a little junky and not a good buy but if you insist...I suggest driving to Aldi."
3,The start of something,"Simon and Garfunkel's debut album of ""songs in the folk tradition"" seems dated now, as these two jewish lads sing christian spirituals and protest songs about hiroshima and race. Admittedly, their vocal style and guitar sounds are usually beautiful. Simon's early songs are dark, but ""Bleeker Street"" shows his astounding potential. Soon straight folk would become folk-rock, and beyond."
4,One for the time capsule,"This album really captures the feel of early sixties Greenwich Village. It would be worth 4 stars just for the incredible ""Bleecker Street"". It was a time when lyrics meant everything and Dylan (and all folkies) wanted to be Fred Neil (check him out)."
4,Acoustic version of Sound of Silience...buy it for that alone,"I always felt their best song was the Sound of Silence, but I must say, after hearing it as it was originally recorded, I like it better! The hit version was overdubbed by the producer. The acoustic version is very powerful. Buy the album for that alone, or buy the song alone via download."
5,Amazing feat for a first,"I tell yea, for a first ablum, Wednesday Morning is an amazing feat. Dealing with biblical passages, haunting metaphors, and blistering enigmas, Wednesday has everything a textured music listener can ask for. Bleeker Street is perhapse the duo's best, while the original Sounds of Silence tends to make the most profound impact. A must for all Villagers and beyond."
2,This is a terrible album!,"This ""newer"" album contains old songs in their early development before they perfected their folk/rock style. Some of these songs were later recorded on other albums and are MUCH better. Others are not worth recording at all. Some of the lyrics and accompiament are different being much more folksy. If you want to hear this for curiosity sake, then go ahead and buy it. As for me, I prefer to hear the songs as they were later perfected and recorded."
5,Great Album,This is a great Simon & Garfunkel album. My father turned me onto their Bridge Over Troubled Water album. This one is just as good if not better. It is like a window to the past... Enjoy!
5,Wonderful!!,"I've been using this product for years. I was recommended this product by my manicurist who has had numerous write-ups in Allure Magazine. It really conditions the cuticle, helping my nails grow long, strong, and beautiful."
1,Drying,"I gave this product a fair trial by using it for over 2 weeks and finally had to stop. My cuticles just got drier and drier after every application. I was so hopeful as the nail balsam seems to really help my nails gain/maintain moisture, but this cuticle treatment does nothing for my cuticles."
5,Perfect for our coach bus company. Extremely easy to use.,"Very easy to use and we don't have to worry about our customers having difficulties using the product, which would then require our bus drivers to stop what they are doing to help the customer. Works very well, clear picture and good sound"
3,fragmented,"short, fragmented, going nowhere...i have listened to most of K.J.'s CD solos. more or less they all got souls. this one is different. it seems that the stakes are too high for him to perform at Carnegie Hall, NYC (20, 30 years since his last solo performance there?) he is apparently afraid to venture out. it's sad that some of the encores (eg., the best version of ""My song"" i've ever heard.) are better than the improvisations"
3,Not a religious experience but still impressive...,"Not the religious experience it's been hailed as by some, but still an impressive and engaging solo piano workout before a worshipful and almost rowdy New York audience."
3,I expected something else,"I was disappointed, I was looking for something more in the spirit of the Koln Concert"
2,Doesn't reach all the Hype,Not nearly as good as the Koln Concert. I really like only one of the tracks.
2,Always different,Its really hard to know what to expect from Kieth. I prefer his jazz improvs. This concert has more disonnant playing than I prefer. The long applause should have been faded out as I find it a distraction. This concert does have its moments though. There aren't enough of them I'm afraid.
4,A nine minute cut with three minutes of applause?,"I've been a huge fan since he played on the Jan Garbarek ECM albums in the '70's.Keith is one of the greatest living piano players. Amazing technique,great musicality.But honestly; over 15 minutes of applause in a two disc set? And the applause is twice as loud as the music! What was he thinking?Mr. Jarrett is not being well-served by his management if they let him ruin a good CD like this. Buy ""Jasmine"" instead or any album with other powerful players that keep his ego in check.What a waste of an amazing performance."
3,"Nice playing, but not his best.","Keith Jarrett's playing is always masterful, but not always transcendent.The playing on this album is very sweet and refined, but something seems to be missing that I have heard on other works. I tend to like the longer more developed pieces that he has done; the Paris, Vienna, and La Scala discs come to mind. Jarrett seems to be moving in the direction of shorter, more focused pieces these days when it comes to the solos. I rather like the long indulgent works of the past, where ideas have an opportunity to grow and develop. But to be fair, there is very nice playing here and it is wonderfully recorded, but delivered with restraint. The excessive audience applause and dare I say sycophantic response by some individuals therein could have been omitted or at least toned down a bit.This is not quiet the listening experience I expected, but may be better appreciated with repeated listening."
2,disappointing,"We have enjoyed the Koln concert recording for years, and found this one quite disappointing. Seemed aimless and unfocused."
2,Short on Music,"Keith Jarrett is always good, but this CD is the shortest in playing time that I have ever heard. I have to wonder if something is missing. Wouldn't recommend buying the CD."
1,poser,"On this album Jarrett thinks he's being avant-garde by aping music that hasn't been avant-garde in 40 years. Much of the music on this disc is nothing less than a sonic rip off of what Boulez and Berio were doing in the 60s, but without any of the highly developed and extremely sophisticated structural and developmental elements that make that music great. He doesn't even understand what he's quite lamely attempting to emulate. It's ersatz and quite embarrassing really, especially for someone of Jarrett's supposed musical sophistication."
3,"Clapping, stomping, and whistling","The piano playing is okay, but if you love clapping, stomping and whistling you'll love this recording, because it has about 10 minutes of it."
3,lose the applause track,The piano playing is excellent. The overwrought applause tracks are so intrusive that they literally ruin the recordings.
5,believing is seeing,"This book by Laura Sewall remains the single best one-dip immersion into the field and thought of ecopsychology. Over the years I have returned to it time and time again, quoting it in many of my own writings and teachings, and continuing to marvel at its artistic mixing of deep theory with light personal stories. Overall, much more readable than Abrams' text by a long shot. For all these reasons, I was very happy that my publisher Green Frigate Books was able to successfuly ask Ms. Sewall to write one of the front-end blurbs to my recently published book ""Profitably Soaked: Thoreau's Engagment with Water"" as well as, especially, the Foreword to my recently published ""Deep Immersion: The Experience of Water."""
4,"A nice, enjoyable read.","I picked this book up expecting something a bit more fluffy and light. I'm so glad I was wrong. It is not a 'happy' novel, and doesn't try to portrey it's characters as perfect, (which they are very definitely not).The author's vision of a post-apocolyptic America is fascinating, mixing science fiction and fantasy without being awkward. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next two books in the series."
3,this was an unexpected enjoyable book,"this is the first of Bush's ""Pride and Pattern"" trilogy, and the best book in the trilogy at that. the book follows the changing relationships between three people, King Abelard, Nydia the witch, and Phineas the captain of the Guard. After saving Nydia from execution Abelard decides to use her against people who stand in his way for gaining complete control over his realm. The society created bu Bush; a scarry and twisted furture america, is intricate and full of mystery, however Bush concentrated on the relationship between Nydia and Abelard more than she should hafe, i think, and this detracted from the actual plot. the ending is completely unexpected and leaves ample room for the two books that followed it."
2,What an unlikeable heroine!,"Eve was manipulative, self-centered, spoiled, immature, and had absolutely no compassion for any other human being. And those were her GOOD qualities! She crawled all over every man she met and then wondered why Ethan had such a low opinion of her. Gee, can't imagine! In all fairness though, as much I liked Ethan, he had to be kind of out there to want this woman!It's a good thing I didn't read this book right after I'd eaten or I doubt the food would have stayed down!I can however highly recommend ""The Sheik's Chosen Wife"" and ""The Arabian Love Child"". They were the reason I got this book and they were both very good!"
4,Well done sequel to The Sheikh's Chosen Bride,"This is Ethan's happily ever after--touching, romantic, and very sweet. His heroine, Eve, is young and vulnerable, and Ethan is truly a hero in helping her through her near date rape. It was great that the plot is actually running simultaneously with Leona and Hassan's as it adds a new dimension to their story as well."
2,temptress?...or hussy?,"The title conforms to the story. Eve was definately a spoiled rotten temptress rich girl, who used seduction and other tempting wiles to get what she wanted. The only thing i favored about this book was Ethan. Poor guy, I felt such sympathy for him. How could a man as smart and charming as he, fall for a winy, sophmoric, hussy like Eve. If you ask me, Ethan should have stuck a pacifier in her mouth each time she decided to put on one of her famous (not to mention WINY) tantrums. My ears were practically SCREAMING.I hope there are better books by Michelle Reid that can molifiy the ache in my ears, because this one was awfully LOUD (and disappointing).Do yourselves a favor people: do not read this book. If you do however, get ready for some MAJOR ear bleeding.Ps. the 2stars are for Ethan."
2,WHAT a brat!,"Read ONLY if you like your female characters immature and unchanged. Usually in stories involving a spoiled heiress, I can find at least something redeeming in that character. Eve was completely unlikeable. Even after what should have been a life altering event, she remained the same obnoxious child from beginning to end. Other than a sexual attraction, nothing explains what Ethan saw in her."
4,Works to make stain lifting easier!,"I ordered this product after moving into a new place that does not have stain resistant carpet. The carpet is thick pile and a light color. Anything that spills on it, immediately soaks into the fibers, and nothing works to get out the stain. Absolutely nothing works. I've never seen anything like it, it's horrible. I have a dog who sometimes has accidents, a child who has food and beverage mishaps and now you can see everywhere they've traversed in the house due to the stains.So I purchased this product to see if the remaining clean area could stay clean. While the spills/mishaps still seem to immediately soak right in, they are much easier to get out with regular soap/water and carpet cleaning products. The directions say you need to reapply the product after carpet cleaning so I ordered several cans.One can did a small living room and dining area. There was no carpet fading. So I would rate this product a success."
3,good product for advertise,"i didnt like this product doesnt hel to protect nothing all the dogs hair are stick anyway and dust too, good product for advertising but not for daily use."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know about Geisha.,"I loved the book Memoirs of a Geisha as a fictional account and it was my first introduction to the Geisha lifestyle. I feel that Liza Dalby's ""Geisha"" is a book version of a FAQ on Geisha. Everything I ever wanted to know is in this book. I think the most interesting parts are when Ms. Dalby explains the differences between a prostitute and a geisha, although, with my westernized upbringing there are still some hazy areas. It was amazing that she, as a foreign woman, was allowed to train to become a Geisha for her research. I found the writing a bit disjointed at times and would have preferred the book to have been separated into two different books, the memoirs and the Geisha cultural study."
4,"If you want to really learn about Geisha, this is great","However, be warned, it is not a novel about Geisha as some people seem to want. She is an anthropologist and she documents and writes like an anthropologist. She casts a keen anthropologist's eye on the culture and how people act and interact. May well be too detailed for some people. I know I got a little bogged down in the last third of the book. But, really answers a lot of questions about the whole process including the trainers, dressers, wig stylists, kimono makers, etc. And I think she does a good job of updating the fact that the Geisha are a lot different now than they were even ten or twenty years ago. They've become pretty modern and the girls are much more in control of their lives. I've read 2 or 3 other books on Geisha and this is the best and most comprehensive by far."
4,Recommended to anyone who wants to learn more about Geisha,"After I read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" I became very interested in Geisha and Japanese culture, so I went straight out and bought this book. ""Geisha"", written by Liza Dalby, an American anthroplologist and the ONLY non-Japanese woman to ever become a Geisha, provides the real-life facts behind Arthur Golden's novel. The book is a combination of social history and entertaining personal anecdotes from her one year stint as a Geisha in Pontocho, Kyoto. I recommend it to anyone who's interested in learning more about Geisha."
3,Conceit overshadows book's virtues,"This book is filled with fascinating information. However, the reader is continually interrupted by the author's incessant self-praise. Evidence of the author's conceit is in every chapter and detracts terribly from this otherwise wonderful book."
4,FUN!!!!,"IT IS FUN!!!an is rated T for teens so little kids can play it if there parents don't like gory games. There is one problem, There are only seven fighters which is not that good, but if your like me and only play with your favorite fighter then if Rayden, Sub-zero, Scorpion, Liu Kang, Sonya, Kano or Jonny Kage is your favorite you can use them and only them. (NOTE TO PARENTS THIS GAME DOES NOT HAVE BLOOD OR GORE BUT ONLY VIOLENCE)"
4,Good nutrition source,I feel good about eating things I can pronounce... and the protein in this bar makes it perfect for breakfast. I'm satisfied for several hours!
4,Super Protein -- sweet but not much flavor otherwise,"This review pertains to the Super Protein flavor protein bar made by Odwalla:I generally like Odwalla bars. None of the flavors has disappointed me, though I do like some of them more than others. (The blueberry and peanut/chocolate chip flavors are particularly good.) The best thing about the Super Protein flavor is that it, in fact, does have more protein than many other bars of similar weight and caloric content. The bad news is that while this flavor doesn't taste bad, it really doesn't have much flavor beyond ""sweet."" So, while I sometimes eat this bar before or after a workout when I cannot make a whey protein shake, I actually prefer other flavors (even though they have less protein) if I'm just looking for a bar to eat as a small meal/snack."
3,No confusing this with a tasty tread,"These are high in protein and other nutrients such that they make a useful snack or meal replacement. They would be improved if Odwala has not added salt.Taste is, of course, subjective, but I find these barsa) limp and soggy, and they sometimes stick to the roof of one's mouthb) having a smell reminding one of old fashioned health food storesTheir very tastelessness is an advantage in that you won't be tempted to one of these until you really need to."
1,Not worth it,"Even with this supposed tacky surface, you'll still be buying some type of tacky glue to get anything to actually stick to it. Very disappointing."
5,get organized!!!,"Easy to hang on either a wall or fabric surface with the adhesives included. Just stuck it on the back of a door and now I have a place to hang all my bills to pay and to do lists. Came packaged well in a large box from Amazon, no creases. Adhesive surface is pretty strong. Holds my 3-5pages bills which are still folded up in one piece. Comes off easily with no tears or residual sticky surface on the papers removed."
5,works perfectly,"I was searching for a bulletin board for my new home office. This product is the right size, hangs up with no fuss, doesn't require pushpins or magnets, and works well. A great little invention!"
5,The color is perfect,"My kitchen is white, black and gray. This self stick bulletin board looks great on the inside of a cabinet door."
4,Nice addition to the office,"Allows neat display of contact lists, price lists, etc. so it is readily available. Looks great and just plain works."
3,"A quality product, but with limited power...","This ""sticky paper"" solution is the kind of high quality product you'd expect from 3M, and comes with thoughtful provisions for trimming and mounting the material to fit whatever space you have. It works well for papers, cards (e.g. Christmas cards) & etc, as long as the material lays flat, but the adhesive is just not strong enough by itself hold pictures or materials that want to roll up or curl at the edges.To complete my ""side of the fridge"" application, I (therefore) needed to purchase a few packages of tiny strong magnets I also found on Amazon(2x Three By Three Seattle Slim Mighties Square and Circle Magnets, 1/4 Inch Length, 1/32 Inch Thickness, Chrome, 12 Pack, 20400) which aren't cheap, but do the trick for supplementing the hold of the 3M material for those items that want to make trouble."
5,A Good single by WC probally best west coast of 03,This was a nice single as usuall by Cube not his old days style but his 4 or 5 year style.This may have been the best song from the Left coast this year.I will recomend this to people goodLyrics 9/10 Production 8/10 Chorus 10/10 Overall 9/10Not a classic single but definantly a nice one
3,much cheaper locally,"way overpriced, these can be found much cheaper at local hardware stores, thought i was purchasing a much larger set of decorations (larger colored balls)"
3,satisfactory,"The notes on the CD say that it plays flawlessly. It played fine on my computer. But the person I gave the CD to as a gift is unable to play it on their multi-disc player. So that is frustrating. Hopefully they will be able to play is on their DVD played instead, but I think that is inconvenient."
5,Classic,"This book is a classic children's book. The poems by Elsa Beskow are beautiful. The drawings portray the seasons and the personalities of the characters pictured - down to the very last little plant. This is a perfect book for education - seasons, months, weather for younger children and flower naming, words and prose for older children. This book is a collection of poems, not a story book. I enjoy this book, as do my children."
2,What others didn't say,I wish at least one of the other reviewers would have mentioned all of the religious references in this book. I was looking for a book that illustrates the changes of the season and helped my child gain appreciation for the beauty of the natural world. I guess I have to keep looking.
2,Boring buzz band,"If moody alternative pop is your thing you may feel at home with these modest expectations, though anyone but nineties nostalgic's will grow numb to a limited vocabulary."
1,the worst tease ever...,this is the worst issue ever. usually the girl on the cover has a pictorial spread. not Olivia munn she has a 2 page splash that has her covering up laying on a couch. don't spend money on this garbage.
5,Classic Barbara,"This is one my long-time favorite albums. Anyone who loves Barbra and has been around for a while should have had this on disc long before now, but I have lagged, holding on to my vinyl. :-)"
1,This remastered cd should be recalled!,"This is a great album...the reason for the 1-star rating is the quality of the newly remastered 2002 disc. It is actually hard to listen to...Barbra's voice in most cuts is scratchy and not clear. If you already own the previous remaster with the white sticker, it sounds so much better than this one. I have to wonder how Sony (or Barbra) would allow this to be on the shelves...there should be a replacement (or credit) recall on this ... what a rip off of a classic early Streisand album."
1,"Great album, bad remastering","This is not a review to dispute the merits of the music, which is some of Streisand's best, but the new remastering -- the third issue of this album on CD -- is radically dissapointing. The new mastering, while it pumps up the volume, sounds shrill and too bright, and even worse - the vocals have slight distortion giving them a ""dirty"" sound. Frankly, the previous remastering with the white sticker sounded much warmer and cleaner. The other newly remastered CDs sound pretty good, especially ""The Broadway Album"" which is a vast improvement on the original, but someone was really careless with this one."
1,Building Help files the OLD way,"When I saw the publish date of 1996, I assumed this book would cover the newest version of the Help compiler from Microsoft. But this book is old. It is so far out of date, it should be pulled from the shelves!"
4,Good Introduction to Iridology,A Good introduction to Iridology which leaves you wanting to go a bit more indepth and read further into the subject.
2,Nothing more than a primer,This book will not make you an iridologist. It is only an introduction or primer. Also there is no clinical validation presented here. You just have to take his word for it.
2,pictures are missing,"After e-mails and phone calls, etc., I finally found out that the publisher (Avery) does not publish the pictures that go in this book anymore. When the author discusses a topic and asks the reader to ""see figure 3.9"", there is no ""figure 3.9"" It is extremely frustrating.I like the book, but don't buy it from this publisher or you will not receive the entire book as it was intended and you won't know what is being discussed."
1,Pictures are still missing,"I purchased a copy of this book in late 2010 and the edition being offered by Amazon at this time is still missing the colored pictures. When you receive the book the back cover states that the color pictures are included, but the publisher has left them out. As stated in another review, you may obtain a copy of the book from the author. I did this and compared that copy and the amazon copy. Besides the color pictures issue, it became immediately apparent that the black and white drawings in the current amazon edition appear streaked and blurry, as if they were photocopied from the original book. The drawings in the copy I obtained from the author were crisp and clean. The book itself seems quite good (I haven't read thru the whole thing yet) and the one star is given for the bad publishing, not for the content of the book itself."
3,Not as well made as just a few years ago,"We bought a NorthStar lantern just a few years ago and decided to get one for our friend as a gift. Ours has a black (painted) cage around the globe and the nut that holds the lantern together is permanently attached to the top.Now they have an unpainted metal cage around the globe which will probably rust, and the nut that holds the lantern together isn't permanently attached to the top, which increases the chance of losing the nut in the dark.Everything else is the same quality, so I'd check on the black cage and nut before buying another."
5,Very nice and bright,Exactly what I wanted. Very bright and electronic starter works great. Very nice construction and looks. Coleman has done it again!
4,Interesting ideas,The authors show how important it is to gather ideas and encourage people to think creatively. I wish they would have described more how they could gather these ideas more effectively.
5,How wrong is it to (just) think big ?!,"""I have been given the chance to upgrade my experience form this great book by in person day-long meeting with authors of this book.Alan's and Dean's story reveals how important the ""small improving ideas"" are in our lives. If you meet somebody with block-buster hunger, buy him a copy of this book."""
3,Beware. The Kindle sample is useless,The Kindle sample of this book is useless. It gives you the introduction and credits and nothing else. You never see any of the book's content. Useless.
2,Out of Steam,"I have been buying Jerry Reed LPs, 8-Tracks and CDs since the 1960s. This CD is for people like me: completists. If you want to own everything by the man, get this one. But, if you're looking for a place to start, or round out, your Jerry Reed collection, this isn't the place. No surprise, after decades of singing and smoking, Reed's voice is pretty well depleted. Evidence of this is clear on the song ""Brand New Me"" -- a new original number which is quite good, but on which Reed has to trot out vocal assistance to finish. The other songs are lethargic shadows of the original. The recording is sloppy -- the first track starts with Reed talking in mid-sentence, and the applause track is clumsily added in a couple of places. If you want to discover what made Jerry Reed great -- and as a songwriter and guitarist he had few peers -- consider picking up one of the other fine CDs available here."
4,"Beautiful location footage, entertaining film","While Mario Lanza's singing is erratic in this film, the overall quality is very good. Stunning views of Rome, and memorable performances byMarisa Allasio and uncredited newcomer Luisa Di Meo. The scene where Lanza vocally mimics Perry Como, Dean Martin, Frankie Laine, and Louis Armstrongis exceptional, and shows a comedic side of Lanza rarely seen."
2,An Incomplete Book,The book did well in getting you started. It went through step by step the installation and setup of Linux. It taught you how to use the included applications and some basic terminal commands.It left out one key subject area that is a mystery to most Linux beginners: how to install programs that didn't come built-in.
2,Bill Gates- your money is safe,"I read somewhere that Linux is free if your TIME is worth nothing. Its true. Unless you are a true geek and spending hours tweaking a operating system sounds like fun to you, don't waste your money or your time."
5,the best!,"I have owned one for several years, and ""made do"" with other cooky sheets for the second batch...after burning some very expensive granola ingredients, even at at 325, I bought a second one. It is a GREAT product, and worth every penny."
2,Elementary,"I'm not a lawyer and I've never been involved in any legal matters and I still found this book to be overly simplistic. It defines civil versus criminal cases and the various parties involved such as Judges, prosecuters, lawyers, defendents, jurors, etc. I already knew almost everything in this book and would recommend it only for the most novice of readers, with no previous knowledge about the courtroom. The book is about 100 pages and is a very quick and easy read."
5,Brings back memories,I moved away from Wisconsin 34 years ago and have missed the polka bands. After buying several CD's I discovered this one that sounds more like the old music I used to know.
3,Surprisingly Dry with Odd Formatting,I bought the Kindle version of the book. After having read Henry VII and His Six Wives I decided to get this book. It wouldn't be so bad (still glad I got a book on the topic) but there is very odd formatting that makes pages on end really hard to read. I put the book down about a month ago and frankly don't even remember where I was at with it and am not sure how soon I'll pick it up again. There has to be a more engaging version of the subject matter somewhere.
3,Special taste,A bit of a struggle to read and not enough personal insight in Mary's character. Only for people who like to read pure history books but don't like the psychology behind the character
3,Mary Tudor,A little too stiffly written for my taste but does seem to stick to historical fact. Good for history buffs.
3,Dull,"I agree with the other reviewers. I love this period of history (my undergraduate degree is in history). But I just could not get through this book, I found it very dull."
4,Uncannily Accurate and Compelling Character Study,"Having grown up not 50 miles from the setting of the Heart of a Distant Forest, I recognized the reality of the characters immediately. Philip Lee Williams' debut novel is a deeply insightful tale of a search for meaning at life's closing. The protagonist, Andrew Lachlan, is drawn with the finest pen, a beautifully captured representative of the academic Southern Gentleman. Lachlan finds himself betrayed by a body whose physical strength had been so important and perhaps more importantly, torn between a conservative heart and a liberal mind. Seeking acceptance and understanding of his life he retires to contemplate the end of his days in solitude. The novel is told as Lachlan's journal and is primarily a character study of this contradictory man, caught between his need for an almost paralyzing self-analysis and a desire to embrace life without regard for the consequences. Fear and love, intimacy and reserve, all do quiet battle for Lachlan's soul."
2,Much flimsier than I expected...,"Rather disappointed in this purchase actually - (bought several that were similar from same mfg) -- quite flimsey plastic and they don't close well (bought a Christmas Tree mold, in addition to this one) -- would not have bought this if I'd seen/felt the quality."
4,A GREAT BUY!,"I was very pleased with this book, lots of recipies, TONS of different ideas. I compared their recipies to others in different cookbooks and the fat and calories were significantly pared down. I real good book that gives you different options to stay on track with Weight Watchers! If you are not following Weight Watchers this is still a good book if you are looking for great recipies that are filling and low in fat."
1,Really want to like this one...,"But wow. what a horribly written cookbook.The pages are MUCH too thin (I found them tearing, esp. when around ANY moisture).Points- instead of being listed UP TOP, they are ""buried"" (so no quick scanning for a 2 point treat) :(Layout/Design- the index is crummy- and the break-down/sections are a bit too 'wide open'.Typeface is hard to read.....even in good light- for the money could they pretend people are reading this?Really would like a more modern/helpful sectionals. (for example crockpot cooking, one dish meals, brunch, etc...)- instead of the rather lame ""chicken"" section, which has everything from chicken salad to fried chicken...I also find it annoying that recipes call for low fat with points, but never convert the dish to no fat, with points.I wanted to like this one...I really did- but I find it much easier just to covert OTHER recipes- less frustration..."
4,Good Cookbook...,"I am so happy with this book, I ordered it along with the ""Simply the Best"". The only thing that they needed to do to get the 5th star is put in more pictures. I like to see a picture of each recipe. There are a few pictures, but not enough for me.I am not actually on the weight watchers program, but I like that each recipe has the dietary information and they are all good recipes. My family hasn't noticed they have been eating healthier because they are still eating great!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this cookbook a little over a year ago, and just recently started using it. Much to my disappointment, the dozen or so recipes I've tried so far have had little to no flavor (with the exception of a Pumpkin Cheesecake..which tasted nothing like cheesecake but hit the spot). Even more poor husband has asked that I stop making recipes from the book. The other down side is that a lot of the recipes require special trips to the grocery store, and requires planning ahead. I'm sure there are some great WW recipes out there, but I'm afraid to try them. I'll be sticking with non-WW healthy eating cook books that let me calculate the points based on their nutritional info."
4,Nice book,Good cookbook and I am hardly a master chef. Handy recipes with lots of different kinds of food (plus the Points values! yay!)Only minor quibble is that it would be nice if all recipes had photos.
4,Very good - but sometimes expensive.,"The meals I have made from this book so far are delicious. I would love to try out all the recipes. But if you are on a budget, it's kind of hard to afford the things that make these recipes so much more tasty and healthy. Still, I think all the meal I've tried were great."
4,Great recipes - but need to convert to winning points.,"The recipes are really great - I've used several at dinner parties and no one even knew they were low fat, low calories. You do have to remember that the points given are for the 123 Success points, not Winning Points - I didnt realize this for awhile so was not counting points correctly when I used some recipes. Other wise there are a wide range of recipes and most are really great!"
3,Not what I was hoping for.,No what I thought. I was hoping for more pictures and lower point recipes. Most meals called for several ingredients. Working full time and lack of cooking experience made this book difficult to fit into my schedule. Hoped more recipes would have me grilling in pam to cut out the unnecessary points in butter and oil.
3,"Sounds good, but isn't so easy.","This book has many recipes that sound delicious; however, many of the ingredients are not things that you would normally have around the house. It is very easy to count points with these recipes, but you might want to consider the 250 Family Recipes or 500 Irresistable Recipes books instead."
2,Dirty,"I thought that the book was as new, the pages were stuck together with food. There were lots of bent pages. I was okay with it being I paid so little for it, but felt that the description was not accurate."
2,YUCK!!!,"I am a little surprised by all the high reviews for this book. I have only made a couple of the recipes from this book, but they have both been horrible. I have never hated somethinig so much that I had to throw it out, but that was the case with what I made with this book. I was actually going to get rid of this book to make room for better cookbooks, until I read all the high reviews on amazon. I may try a couple more recipes before I make my final decision. There are more recipes I would like to try, but am a little apprehensive. I don't want to waste too much more time or money on something that is not going to turn out. I do like the Simply the Best cookbook by Weight Watchers better than this one (so far)."
3,"Tasty and healthy, go together.","As child,I so hated being told ""You are eating a healthy meal tonight."" Into my mind would pop memories and awful tasting or bland foods. Thankfully I now only have those memories. Healthy and tasty now go together so well. I have yet to make any of the recipes in the book, I only recieved 1 day ago, but having flipped through, which is why I give it 3 stars. I think my daughter will even happily eat what I put on her plate. I do not follow the Weight Watchers plan, I am only looking for different ways to prepare the the things I love."
1,Disappointed.,"I love the recipes in the Weight Watchers magazine, so I thought I would love the cookbook. Wrong! There are very few pictures that show the final product--pictures often convince me to try the recipe. In fact, the whole book is bland, bland, bland. The recipes are not the type recipes I would make on a daily basis--many I would not even want to try. Come on Weight Watchers, I know you can do much better than this!"
5,YUM!,"This cookbook has a ton of great recipes that helps you stay on track using the WW points system! I love it! So does my husband and he is not even on WW!!! The meals do not taste ""diet""."
3,Costume Bows,"They company has very quick shipping, but the product is are a bit flimsy (mainly the metal clips). I purchased this for a Halloween costume, so it was perfect to use just once (inexpensive, fast shipping and look just like the photo)."
5,MIU France Red Pepper Mill and Salt Shaker Set,We couldn't be more pleased with our salt and pepper shakers.They are very attractive and the pepper mill works just perfectly. We have been looking for something of this quality for quite some time.
1,If you want your kids confused (at least in math) buy it,"UGH! For my first 15 minutes of reviewing the DVD, I choose the math portion as that is where my children need the most help. I selected Fractions & Decimals, a critical base knowledge needed for all following math instruction. You'd think that out of the 3 or 4 example problems in each section there would be no errors, but there were in fact a few. Inexcusable, obviously nothing was reviewed.First impressions, make me feel that the rest of the instructions were probably put together with the same thought and care. Not good enough."
1,Old School Videos now packaged!,"Buying this for my daughter, I just went through it only to find that it's just like the videos I was forced to watch as a child in school. The graphics are updated but many slides and videos are narrated by a voice so slow and calm that it almost caused me to sleep while just looking through it.If you are looking for something that will stimulate your child's curiosity or at the very least get to the heart of the subject efficiently, this is not the package for you!"
4,Great work that won't make you feel left out,"Poets and poetry can oftentimes make you feel out of the loop, as if you aren't getting something. Troupe's work doesn't do that, and most notably here. This is poetry for people who don't know if they like poetry, even if he doesn't deignate it as such. The work is earthy, engaging and a legit story lies in almost every one.Good stuff, and will impress the weird poet crowd if you're caught with it. ;-)"
3,Not one of the better Bean movies,"My wife and I really enjoy Rowan Atkin's - Mr Bean character, but this isn't one of the better ""Bean Movies"" - only average. If you've watched any of his prior work, you've seen these situations all before - the plot is the only thing this is different - and the plot is rather questionable. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do so, but don't go out of your way to do it."
3,Dont be fooled!...its an OK film...nothing more,"Can't see how this is an ""improvement"" to the first, its still dull and has some, not all, the same old, same old funny skits from his TV show, however, there were some parts that were funny. Now, i will agree, it has put some new stuff in the movie and they have cut down the ""old skits from TV show"" a tad..but, its still there no matter how you see it, and you will see an ""old skit"" you already seen on his TV show..nothing new..again!. I was hoping for ""redemption"" from the first film..but all i got was disappointment. Stick to his first film, that one (even as dull and dry as it was) was at least a tad funnier than this one. This is a rental at best!"
3,"TAKE CHAPLIN, PEE WEE HERMAN AND JERRI BLANK AND YOU GOT......... BEANS!","Mr. Bean is a very strange character and right away I was thinking.....what do you get when you take an English Pee Wee Herman crossed with Charlie Chaplin and then throw in a little of Jerri Blank(Strangers with Candy)?.....Mr. Beans!....that's who! This movie while funny is a bit too much ""Beans"" for me and I believe he is better in small doses. It's hard to believe the rave reviews of this film!?? It's not bad, but 5 stars?......is really pushing it. It's a funny little family film, nothing more. I rate it 2 1/2 stars for having a quirky little guy who doesn't add up to much more than a hill of ......Beans!;-b"
5,~ Unusual (ly good!) ~,"This is not really the same line of ""Bean's movies"".... this one has ""something"" that, as the movie goes, hooks your heart in... until the end which is extremely touching, beautiful... I have all the movies of Mr Atkinson and all the episode of Mr. bean (and I love them all) and I must say that this is the very best movie he has ever made because it really touched my heart in a big way..."
5,Hysterically funny!,"Again, hysterically funny! Mr Beans never fails to make you laugh. Some real out loud laughs! Have watched several times."
4,Classic Mr. Bean!,This movie is Mr. Bean at his best! Max Baldry and Emma de Caunes compliment Rowan Atkinson perfectly. Anyone who thinks sight comedy is dead should definitely view this production!
4,"Excellent collection, but not quite perfect","I have always enjoyed Mr. Bean and so and happy to have the collection. I was only disappointed with this set in that Mr. Beans Holiday was only the standard screen version, not the widescreen. Mr. Bean the Movie has both versions, it seems rediculous not to do the same with Mr. Beans Holiday."
4,Interesting.,"This movie moves kind of slow and I thought it was just weird at first, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie. It is really slow and the humor is very dry, but it is funny and the ending is very good. My kids really liked it."
4,Funny But Excruciating At Times,"I've always had a thing for slapstick, and British comedy too. This combines them both in the spirit of Benny Hill.If you are expecting a lot of dialogue from the hero, forget it. Bean does with grunts, gurgles, and an occasional word, all to great comic effect. A child in a man's body, he just can't cope well with the real world.As he plods along on his trip to Cannes, you can just see the gags coming a mile away. In fact, if they hadn't happened, I would've been disappointed. Yet, his bad luck was at times excruciating as you just know he's going to do... don't want to spoil the gags.I enjoyed the first movie and this is no exception. I don't think you can really improve on this formula, and I look forward to the next one. Live on Mr. Bean!"
2,Not good at all!,"I've been a fan of Rowan Atkinson for years and I picked this movie up thinking it would be a great addition to my collection. Boy was I wrong!The movie was just subpar by all means, the jokes were lousy, The acting in it seemed rather below the standard.The video Quality was great though, very clear and precise HD Quality I would have to give it a good 4.5 out of 5 stars.I'm selling this movie for credit towards another one ASAP, very disapointed in this film!"
2,The New Peter Sellers? Nope!,"I found this film to be annoying for the most part. The film seemed a poor attempt to capture the comedy of the ""Pink Panther"" movies. Atkinson is no match for Sellers. The film is silly, insulting, and just plain dumb. Sorry I wasted an evening viewing this stinker."
4,Mr. Bean review,"This gift is for my wife and she really enjoyed it.Watching these full feature films or the ""five-minute"" clips is fun just like 15 years ago.Mr. Bean: The Ultimate Collection"
1,really bad movie,i am a big mr bean fan but this movie sucked. basically if you watch the trailer you saw the entire movie. cant believe they put this out. bad job.
5,Excellent Collection!,"What can I say? If you like Mr. Bean, you will love this collection. Even includes 2 dvd's of the animated series. Would definately buy again!"
3,An elaborate setup -,"On the surface, slow & silly. Yet, a few, very bright moments..An elaborate joke that makes it well worth it!"
3,Good movie,"This is a very good movie, it is quite funny. However, in the digital version which I downloaded onto my Tivo box, it didn't have subtitles for the French speaking parts. My TV's subtitles wouldn't work with it either. The day before I downloaded this from Amazon, I had rented it from Netflix (watched 30 minutes of it and then it wouldn't play because the disc was scratched up) and it had subtitles on it when it played so I know it wasn't my TV. Just wanted to give a heads up for anyone else downloading this movie."
5,Very funny and very enjoyable,"For me, a comedy gets 5 stars if it is laugh out loud, and this one often is. Also, if it's a film I'd like to keep, and see again some time. It is."
5,What's not funny about Bean?,"As I received the package and saw the dvds I started to laugh with anticipation. Somebody wrote, the episodes where cut and they where disappointed. Don't worry about things you cant control. The dvds are done well so; What's not funny about Bean??"
4,Hilarious I LLOVED IT &#9825;,The only reason i didnt rate this five stars is because its not in spanish.But you really dont need to know anything because he doesnt even speak.He's too funny
1,"After This Film, Maybe He Should ""Speak Up"" A Little More...","Meh. I found Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean somewhat entertaining on the BBC (aired for me on PBS) in the early 90's, and even found the first film ""Bean"" with a few chuckles, but the silent well's run dry here. In it, Bean wins a contest to go to the Cannes Film Festival, yet only wants to go for the beach (?). Of course he goes on his usual unapoligetic destructive path and loses his tickets, way, and you know how it usually goes from there. But as with other road-movies, this one just seemed to go nowhere. And what bet did Willem Dafoe lose to have to appear in this one? Man, talk about career slumming, even though his character's movie-within-a-movie bit was a tad interesting (yet not funny either).Another ""watched off the TiVo"" expierence. And with the delete button, it now feels relieved."
1,Worst movie ever!,"If I could have given it no stars, I would have. This movie has replaced Tenacious D as the all time worst movie EVER made. Anyone with a brain will absolutely hate it. I love Mr. Bean's PBS show. It's witty, funny, downright hilarious. But the movies really are bad. I say the only people who may like this movie are between the ages of 6 and 12, who like anything that is stupid."
1,Mr. Bean: The Ultimate Collection,Very disapointed that half of the CDs are cartoons... animated...I cannot find anywhere that states this fact about the CDs...
1,Wow! Stinks!,"I saw this movie in the theaters with others. We agreed to walk out on the movie about 30 minutes into the show. It's the only movie we all had ever walked out on. Terrible! This movie gets a one-star rating only because zero or negative stars is not possible. This movie's humor seems to center on Mr. Bean doing his thing, oblivious to other people and ignoring their reactions. At least his TV shows had him reacting with scared little expressions or actions after he'd pulled his blunders. He's unrepenetant and unreactive about his actions here and that makes the movie NOT FUNNY! It's like a joke with no punch line. Boring at best, and irritating most of the time."
5,Good price,"I've always loved this joy and loved watching it as a kid, when I saw it was half off I wasted no time in purchasing it. Everything was great."
2,Not complete episodes on Christmas & Do It Yourself !,"I have waited to buy this box set on DVD, as the first box set didn't include two famous scenes. On the Christmas episode, the turkey weighing part was missing(one of the funniest parts). On the Do It Yourself episode, same thing! Missing part when older lady gets trapped by crazy recliner due to Mr. Beans intervention! So, I hung onto my old VHS copies, that are un-edited. I saw this newer version that includes both Bean movies and hoped they had listened to past complaints and re-did the editing on the t.v. episodes. OH NO! They are just copies of the original, badly edited first edition DVDs!Terrible, expected much better. I'm sure Mr. Atkinson and his fellow writers would be appalled!"
3,All in one place,All of Mr. Bean in one place + the two movies. A little disappointed on Beans Holiday. The standard screen edition is the only format. On the 1st movie you can watch either.
5,A wonderful resource!,"For several years we've memorized hymns as a family, so when I found this book I was ecstatic. We're reading it a chapter a month and learning one of the hymns that goes with each story. It's obvious that an amazing amount of research went into this book, but somehow it doesn't feel as though the information is being stuffed into you. The stories become real. I look forward to reading the second one in the series, and hope to see others in the future. *note--the book includes lyrics and music for many of the hymns. I don't play an instrument, so we've learned some of the tunes from the Cyber Hymnal, another resource well worth checking out!"
3,Very good.,"I have one comment. I wish the translators of Rumi's works would know a little more about the language, history, and culture in which Rumi has created his works. I think this helps translation. Rumi's work is not just text books in mystics or others. It is a result of a civilization, understanding, and Love. Let's learn that."
5,great lantern,"I have been using battery operated lanterns for years and hate spending lots of money and using very toxic batteries in the wilderness, so this is a great alternative with cheap energy source (gasoline)."
5,Great Lantern for camping!!!,"Just got back from a camping trip where I used this lantern and case. At first, I thought I might have made a mistake in buying this lantern over the Coleman Powerhouse lantern after I unpacked it. It's on the small compact size and I was hoping that it wouldn't be underpowered. It definitely didn't disappoint! It easily lit up our campsite and then some, and since it's compact, didn't take up a lot of room for packing and storing in my garage after we were done. The light is a lot warmer looking than an LED or flourescent lantern and doesn't blind you. The case doesn't really latch tightly on the bottom, I wish they had a better latch system to be more secure. It feels like the bottom might drop out if you were to carry it without holding the bottom. Overall, very satisfied and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a bright, economical camping lantern that will last."
5,Great Buy,"This is a great lantern, have an older model that is still in use and works great after 19 years. Had to buy another one as the price was to good to pass up, and it is still made in the USA. Highly recomend this lantern for camping or power outages. The liquid gas is much better than propane bottles as it last twice as long as my friends propane."
1,does not work,"I bought this to use on a recent camping trip and it would not work. It was my fault for not testing the item before I went on the trail, my bad. I had 5 other people with me on this trip, all with more camping experience, and no one could make it work. When I came home I placed another set of mantles on and tried again, still nothing. The worst part is now I'm being told by Amazon that I cannot return this item. This information would have been nice to know prior to my purchase seeing that I now have a $80.00 paperweight. I'm very disappointed in this transaction. As I search through Amazon's pages I cannot even find a customer service e-mail address to ask about this. My bottom line is I have to leave a negative review here so hopefully others will learn from my mistake."
1,Poor quality,"This Emerson phone has two poor qualities. One: volume issues. It is simply not loud enough even though I have tried everything and spoken to Emerson. Two: the cord is much too short. I could have gotten a longer cord, but the weak volume is a deal buster for me. I would not recommend this product."
1,not phone that is shown,"This phone does not have a caller ID, the microphone does not pick up on the speakerphone. It is completely different from the picture. Do not purchase this and think this is the actual phone you are getting. Spend more money and get a better quality phone."
4,review of English manor house,A beautiful coffee table book with lots of photographs of manor houses and their interiors. A bit dissapointing that all the photographs were in black & white and of the interiors most were just of the entrance hall. Note that the book in on English Manor Houses and not Stately Homes.
5,From the archives...,"""From the archives of Country Life"" almost says it all. Jeremy Musson does a wonderful job of applying fresh commentary to these outstanding photographs of some of England's most beautiful manor architecture. This book and others ""from the archives..."" are required reading and study for anyone wanting to understand the development of the romantic picturesque archtiectural essays of late 19th and early 20th centuries in the UK and US."
5,New driving music for me.,"I like klezmer music, and this album is one of the reasons why. The performance is great. The exploration of the influence of cultural music styles on klezmer is wonderful. Great fun to listen to on a road trip."
4,Deep and challenging,"This is really a great book by the Archbishop of Canterbury that looks at the Desert Mothers and Fathers of the 4th century and attempts to use their wisdom to give us insight into what should be our modern and personal monastic tradition. This is not an easy read. It is interesting but it is philosophical and requires some reflection to get it. There are parts of it that are still unclear to me. However, it is an inspiring book that can change the way you see your life and your relationship to Christ."
4,gripping tale about life on the range,"This was a gripping tale about life on the range with some suspense thrown in. I've read other books that have let the story be the harsh climate, ranching, and small town life. This book did that plus had an intriguing storyline/mystery."
3,authenticity challenged,"Claire Davis is a good writer, but this book is a bit over the top. It's not how we really live on the Great Plains, but a sensational version of it. For a gripping account of these same issues from someone who's lived it rather than researched it, try Linda Hasselstrom's ""Feels like Far."""
2,Too many false notes,"I bought the book because it had good reviews and I was interested in the Montana setting. Unfortunetly, it didn't read very well. Too uneven, too much ho-hum folksy dialogue, too many false and just bad moments. For example the line during the sex scene on page 45, ""he laid his hands on the hairs that furled into the ditch between her thighs."" Ditch? I think the author tried for too much. I appreciate her ambition, but couldn't buy the characters(especially Pervis), not evn Pattian. What kind of name is that? The characters just seemed too made up and I couldn't forget that I was reading a book."
1,Not for the feint of heart,I couldn't stomache the crulety to the animals. Only the worst of our society would treat animals in this fashion.
2,Misleading Title,"Because of the promise of the title I was greatly disappointed in the content. It records one mans journey of recovery after the suicide of his wife. It's focus is on his reentry into a new relationship. Unless this is your specific concern I would not recommend this book for anyone seeking depth of solace, understanding and healing in the aftermath of suicide. While I am sure the writing of it helped in the authors recovery it helped little in mine. Perhaps a more appropriate title would be ""How I dealt with grief and dating and codependancy in the aftermath of my wifes suicide."""
3,Not Bad...,"Clarke's book is another of those ""good books, not bad, not great."" Depending on what the reader is searching for, this could be great. The author does spend a significant amount of time on his codependency issues and his tales of trying to date after his wife's suicide, but all in all, it's not bad."
5,There's hope for those struggling to have faith,"This book is great for those of us who struggle from time to time to believe God for all the good things we want to achieve in our life, or for solutions to the problems we face. Using Psalm 37:4 as a starting point, the author shows how, when our faith is lacking, we should step back and begin by looking at our desires. Cultivating the desires in our heart, while walking in accordance with God's Word, is like cultivating a seed which eventually will produce faith. The examples used of several biblical characters like Joseph and Abraham, as well as the stories of present day people like you and me who exercised desire and saw fantastic results, encourage the reader to follow their example and put the Word of God into action in order to see similar results in their own life. Anything you desire can be achieved when you delight yourself in the Lord first. A simple yet deep and thought-provoking book!"
2,I was disappointed in the fabric,I was disappointed in the fabric - the color faded out very quickly and it started to fray faster than my prior Valley Forge flag did.
4,"Good, Basic Information",This is a handy little book if you need a quick source of basic cultural information about a particular orchid. The book contains 250 color photos over 160 types of orchid species and hybrids. This makes it a valuable aid in identifying those mystery orchids that we all seem to come across.
5,Tell it like it is,"Bob Barr has written an excellent book. Using clean, spare language he gets his points across and builds a convincing case. He uses specific images and anecdotes that are sometimes funny, sometimes disturbing and always work to their best effect and stay with you. In a highly readable fashion, Bob Barr also gives you a good understanding of how things work in Washington, D.C. If you want a better understanding of how government works, if you care about National Security, if you care about the future of America, I strongly recommend this book. I was walking in lower Manhattan this morning and I stopped by to look at historic Fraunces Tavern and to remember where a different kind of terrorist group set off an explosion and injured and killed innocent people almost 30 years ago. I found it chilling to read in Mr. Barr's fine book that the Clintons didn't seem to have a problem offering clemency to members of this terrorist group during Mr. Clinton's final days in office."
5,Great new product!,The millennial crutch is a great new design on the old standard wooden crutches. The spring action and curved design of the crutches won't jam your underarms.
4,Need a leg up!,"These crutches work very well. They help alleviate some of the shock regular crutches have. They also help to propel you a little bit, but not make you off balance with the shock absorber/piston on the end.Two negatives... the hand pieces tend to loosen all the time. You have to make sure they are tight every time you use them. Additionally, one of the plastic mold pieces has cracked on mine after 2 weeks of use...will call Millennial tomorrow to see if they will help."
5,Great product,Works great and very comfortable too. Had several knee operations and really helped a lot. The only problem is now I have back trouble too (not because of the crutches).
5,Best crutch for those with upper body weakness,These crutches made my recovery from ankle reconstruction so much easier. The spring action assists enough to keep me from having to do all the work propelling myself. I highly recommend them especially for those with upper body weakness and/or arthritis.
5,Millenial Travel Crutches,"I drive a small car with a small trunk. It happens to be a 2 seater so space is a premium. These crutches fold nicely and fit very well in my trunk so I can have a passenger. I rate these babies 5 stars, and the service I got was great, good communication and package arrived timely and undamaged. Would recommend both the crutches and Millenial."
4,Nice Crutches...Loving it!!!!,"I have to say that I was initially scared reading all the bad reviews about these crutches but I am loving it so far. Only a few days ago I have ordered this and was able to manage this very easily. They even have written ""R"" and ""L"" for Right and Left crutches respectively and so I don't have any issues about figuring this out. Also I am a permanently disabled person. I generally need to be crutches for extended period of time. Having spring motion really help and especially ergonomic handles helps reducing pressure. Overall I would recommend you to try. Only con I saw was a bit of of noise that spring actions makes but it doesn't bother me at all."
1,Be Careful,"I expected to receive the complete book, but what I got was Vol. 2 of this book. The image of the book if you click to look inside is of Vol. 1"
5,Excellent Seismic Reference,"I bought this book to study for the PE Structural 1. It is a thorough, item by item book that has excellent symbol references, clear definitions, worked examples etc. The author is interested on you, the reader, understanding seismic design, unlike many of the other books on the market that cater to someone impressing their literary peers. The UBC 97 was a landmark in Seismic design, and although I agree with the other reviews that it may seem ""out of date"", I found it helpful to use this book to learn the fundamentals regading seismic, which are still the same in today's codes. Excellent chapters on vibration and diagphragm analysis. All I can say is that it helped me tremendously in the PE, which is the reason I bought it."
5,The Sydney I wanted to hear about,"Really loved this Biography of Sydney. I must say I'm a fan of JB now after reading the WW2 trilogy which I loved too. I have always wondered about a lot of the darker things about Sydney, having come here in the late 80's, I think you get more of a sense as an outsider looking in. It is a confusing city at times, and as a friend of mine says....it's not as funky as it thinks it is.... This is true sometimes as seen through the violence recently and not so recently. But overall it's a great place to live, and this book has definitely helped me understand some of the difficulties Sydney has been through.The book feels like it will be almost a manual for Sydney, to go back and check facts, mostly to solve arguments I suppose, because you get those conversations where people want to out-dark each other by knowing the dirtiest stories. Yeah this book will come in handy for sure"
1,PULL THE TRIGGER ON THIS ONE!,"Arthur Clarke's book is so preachy that even a strong gun control advocate like myself was grinded down by the final page. Way over the top! The book has all the elements of a winner, but never delivers. He introduces us to several ""Einstein"" like characters that could be facsinating, however his character development is so bad, that you never get to know these brillant minds. Oh how I was left totally unsatisfied! Yes I did keep reading,but I found myself rapidly skimming the the pages to get to the end of this dreary gun control lecture. I was surprised that this has 4 stars. In terms of this being a science fiction work, forget it, it's not."
3,Not One of Clarke's Better Efforts,"This book has some interesting what if situations, based on the invention of a device that triggers all weapons within a specified range. This invention virtually renders all conventional weapons (guns, bombs) useless. Where the book lacks is in character development and plot. Instead of writing this book, Clarke could have choose to write an political essay on the plusses and minuses of using the technology introduced in the story."
2,For the politicos or lawyers...not for the sci-fi fan,"I'm in agreement with some of the other readers...spends way too much time describing politics and not enough with the technology. In addition, in trying to describe the sociological effects of this ""trigger"" device (which is used to explode munitions containing nitrates) the author seems to overlook the fact that humans have been killing each other with edged weapons for thousands of years. This kind of lapse makes the story rather laughable as this component is not offered to display effects the trigger has on societies. In addition, it is offensive to see the gun lobby portrayed the way it is in this book. This book is clearly anti-gun and anti-American in the way it portrays our government and our established laws. Mr. Clarke, quit lending your name to works that don't deserve it!"
1,"Good writing,horrid message","Christians and social conservatives, especially second amendment advocates, will be outraged. Their positions, as well as their own good selves, are viciously caricatured by two professionals who do it with great style and savagery. It would be ridiculous to call a work of fiction dangerous, but this one is certainly unhelpful. Those who most fear the violence of the world around them tend to either support firearms ownership or firearms abolition. Those of either persuasion who read this book will be more polarized than ever. Shame on both Messrs. Clark and Kube-McDowell!"
1,Badly written and retarded,"I've bought this book because of the Arthur Clarke's name on it. However judging from reading it, Mr. Clarke could have provided only the general plot. I will never believe that he could do such a horrible writing. The book is long and extremely slow-paced. The characters in it are badly retarded: all their actions are predictable 100 pages ahead yet they struggle hard during these 100 pages to come to obvious conclusions. The ""science"" in this book is completely phony. The book is so stupid and boring that I was not able to finish it. (By the way, do you know that the firearms with liquid (gasoline-like) propellant already exist and are considered the guns of the future ? This makes the described social effects of the main invention in this book, to put it mildly, unconvincing.)"
1,Social Commentary Masquerading as Fiction,"I had an opportunity to read this book and was eager to do so. Arthur C. Clarke is one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors, and I have enjoyed many of his works. Sadly, I could not finish this book because in 75 pages it was clear this was a myopic, politically-correct and fantastical vision of the way the world ""ought to be."" The ""science"" is theoretical junk, based on good wishes not scientific theory. The idea that peace would break out if all guns and explosives were rendered useless is the most hilarious, yet sad, idea that is repeatedly expressed by the authors. I look back on history and recall the millions who were slaughtered or enslaved by nations that possessed only the sword and the spear and laugh at the idea that removing weapons will change man's aggressive and dominating tendencies. Don't buy this book and contribute to ludicracy. Invest in your civil rights by reading the Constitution and the Federalist Papers (available here at Amazon, I'm sure)!"
4,An interesting idea...,"Personally, I found this book to be very thought-provoking. The views of our society and political system are interesting, and the science behind how the Trigger works was intriguing to me. I had never thought of the universe that way.Even though the book does get a little preachy at some parts, the message behind this book is a good one. Some of the gun advocates do come across as a bit overdone and maybe even a little villainous but it doesn't detract from the story, and you can still understand both sides of the argument. It also offers a somewhat bleak view of our future. While the idea of something that could render a gun useless is a reassuring one, its implications are a bit frightening. What could be next?All in all, I thought it was a good book."
1,a 10-page essay straining to fill a 500-page novel,"Whether or not you find the premise intriguing, this book is an unmitigated disaster when judged as an actual story. There are no antagonists worth mentioning, no real conflict, no satisfying explanations of the speculative technology, and NO PLOT. By the time I had reached the 300th page I was thinking, ""ok, I get it already. Do I really need to read to the end? No."" (I did anyway in the hopes of some surprise or twist at the end, of which there of course was none, or none worth mentioning at least.) Why these two gentlemen decided to force a truly lifeless novel out of a small essay's worth of ideas is beyond me. I have enjoyed Mr. Clarke's work in the past, but I was actually quite angry after wasting my time wading through this limp polemic."
1,Too bad....,"This book is the result of a previously succesful, gifted author--Clarke--deciding late in his days that it's OK to get political. The result is a wish list of things that might issue from technology. We have my namesake, Horton, making the serendipitous discovery of an effect that no one can explain, but which causes the destruction of nitrogen-based explosives. What does the world do then?Another reviewer points out the imbalanced viewpoints, pro-gun people being totally irrational in the book, anti-gunners being walking ages of reason. I agree with his criticism of this. One might do well to send Messers Clarke and Kube a copy of John Lott's excellent statistical study of the matter: More Guns, Less Crime.Or:I could just chalk it all up to the genre. After all, it's *supposed* to be fiction. I might as well see the idea that predatory people won't take advantage of a Trigger as another part of the same fiction. Too bad that it flies in the face of demonstrated human nature."
5,Friendly Persuasion--Ray Coniff,My favorite recording artist of the late 50s-early 60s-my college years-easy listning-I can still recall hearing Pat Boone sing Friendly Persuasion in the movie
5,Superb,"Just love the music for relaxing around the house. Brings back memories of my Mom, singing in the kitchen or cleaning the house way back in the 50s/60s"
3,A few good concepts that could be summarized in 20 pages,"Identifies difference between large and small selling. Overall does make a few good points but the author could have summarized in less than 20 pages. My recommendation: do browse through the book but don't spend more than day or two reading it.Summery: Implication and need-payoff are the most important stages of large selling. More you work on these questioning stages better you will get at large sales, as you will learn objection prevention Vs handling."
3,GOOD AUDIO BOOK FOR SALESMAN WHO DRIVE OR FLY,"A lot of good thought provoking information is presented in this book. Old ideas are studied and evaluated for their effectiveness when selling big ticket items. Even if you are in a small ticket market you will pick up something that may be useful in your next sales call.I like the book on CD because it makes ""productive use"" of drive and fly time."
2,Kodak endorses this program right?,"Notice that Kodak layed off several thousand more employees today. Kodak (ticker symbol:EK) was one of the biggest laggards on the DOW and slowed down substantially circa 1987, the same time this book came out.Notice that the current print of this book in hardback is dated 1988. Despite all of the hype and cheerleading, there have been no new printings for nearly 20 years!SPIN has a place in selling, no doubt about it. But there is much more to selling than just SPIN. If you doubt me, just ask Kodak."
3,"Good for making large sales, poor for small sales.","Spin Selling neglects the importance of personal chemistry in the business of selling. It implies a fear approach to the prospect in telling him what he is missing by not using your product, and the possible consequence. The reality is that, in the competitive market place, most products are similar in function and costs. His current vender is not necessary worse than you are in supplying a good product and excellent services. The account goes to the person who comes across as a trustworthy individual who can take his words to the bank, but not the one who makes the purchaser uncomfortable. Not building the proper relationship first, the prospect will thank you for making him realize the importance of buying the product and call his favorate vendor, your competitor as you walk out with an ""advance""."
4,outdated now,As a basic qualification methodology SPIN is till used although it is outdated now. The Internet has changed the buyer - vendor dynamic and buyer's are better informed.
4,"An excellent approach to ""selling""","I am a personal coach and I offer a high-cost service - I am not a sales professional and I do not like to ""sell."" This method is just what I've been looking for. I have listened to the audiocassette a couple of times and I find the SPIN Selling approach easy to understand and effective.The only thing that prevents me from giving this book 5 stars is the information sounds more like a research paper than a book - it's a bit dry, academic and takes longer to get to the point. But, the value of the useful information presented makes it worthwhile. A big thumbs up!"
4,A sales book a techie type can stomach,"I'm a geek, but, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was forced to create some sales training. I had this book recommended to me, and it saved my sanity.The title is very unfortunate. ""SPIN"" in this book doesn't refer to the stuff that White House flunkies and PR flacks do...it's an acronym for the components of Rackham's sales methodology.If you're not a sales type, you may have been grossed out by the high B.S. level of most books about selling. This book, on the other hand, is very factual and direct, and it's free of hoopla, glittering generalizations, and vacuous, trivial ""case studies."" Most amazingly, it presents sales in a way that makes it seem not so morally repellent. If it's humanly possible for sales to be a customer-service function, it's by following the practices in ""Spin Selling."""
4,Absolutely a must read for any sales pro!,"Read it. Read it again. Read it a third time. Much of the information (minus the constant put down of other sales training books within the work, reason for the 4 and not a 5) is incredible. Easy to read. Simple to implement. As a long time sales professional I have read many sales oriented books over my career. This is definitely on top of the ""technology type"" oriented books. I am in automotive sales and sometimes the principles do not transfer very well. This book is okay for my business. Along with this book, I would prefer any car salesperson (pro or green-pea) buy ""Cars and People: How to Put The Two Together"" before they work on my lot."
3,Great but needs a new edition.,It you sell a product in one face to face sales call this is your book but if your product requires several sales calls this book is just the start. The book is over 20 years old and if a new editon that take into account how things have changed it would be much more useful. I have read it a couple time and the SPIN sequence is a great start for new sellers.
4,Not bad for dull subject matter,"Personally, I thought this book could have been condensed down quite a bit (I found the graphics to be nearly useless). However, it did help me to recognize, consolidate, and understand much of what I have picked up on my own over the last few years.In addition, I found myself in agreement with most of what the author had to say which helped to build my confidence level. The book contains many useful examples which highlight the author's methods. The most interesting portions of the book are the author's disproval of the effectiveness of some well-known sales techniques when used in large accounts. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who makes his living in sales. You are almost certainly going to pick up something useful.I also agree with the reviewer below with regard to the title of this book. Perhaps the author should venture into marketing as his next area of research."
5,A great handbook,A great handbook based on extensive research that deals primarily with the large sale. It provides the power tools for making the most of a sales call. This book guides you to form the questions required prior to making each call. Working this system will produce extraordinary sales results.
4,Read for School,"I read this book for a sales and negotiations course in my undergrad. It did a good job of showing the importance of the cycle that sales goes through. How you need to find pain then follow the steps recommended here.Overall, a very good book."
4,The system does work very well,"This book was recommended to me by several highly successful people in the business world. These people emphasized that this book was the reason why they were so successful. It was with that in mind that I purchased this book.There is no spin in spin selling. The title may imply some sort of deception, but that's very far from the truth. Spin is an acronym for the technique this book is teaching. I'm saying this because I've encountered a number of people who decided to judge this book on its title rather than giving it a fair reading.Spin selling puts the reader in a position to understand what the customer is looking for and will be able to make recommendations in order to help them. The technique here is all about the customer rather than ripping the customer off. Spin selling, in that way, is about developing a relationship with the customer in order to guarantee more business with them in the future.Give it a look and see for yourself."
3,"Too much bashing of ""other"" books","There are some interesting ideas and advice in SPIN Selling. However, the author spends too much time praising his own research and bashing other sales books. Negative selling does not get one anywhere. This applies to both major and minor sales."
2,My 6 year old clearly writes his thoughts better...,"My 6 year old clearly writes his thoughts better than the author does. That is not so say that the book does not offer any truths about the ""big sale"" but he could have easily written it in about 20 pages. The scripted conversations are ridiculously simple and in the ""what not to do"" scenarios the sales rep making suggestions would have lost their jobs in 1988 when the book was originally written (I love the references to the ""big eight"", that's what re-releases are for) or can be found today on some used car lot in the California desert.This book reads like a consultant wrote it, a lot of words and wasted time determining what you already knew. If you're a sales manager looking for a book for your staff I would not recommend this one for anyone with more than a years experience if they made quota. If you have a rookie or someone making the transition from small commodity sales to larger ones then MAYBE at best.P.S. no book deserves 1 star"
1,There are better books.,"While I appreciate the effort to create a book on consultative style selling, this book just doesn't cut it. It may be a little better than the hardsell techniques espoused by some sale trainers, but it doesn't hit it.Obviously this book was written by people who have never sold anything besides books and overpriced seminars. Also quite obvious, is that the reviewers giving this book 5 stars have never sold anything either and are merely creating aliases and giving themselves ""helpful"" votes to earn points for an ""Amazon Top 1,000 Rating"" which is about as worthless as this book.One reviewer made a challenge here sometime ago. Doesn't look like he/she got any takers. Now I wonder why?"
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this book after receiving a recommendation from a friend that also works in sales. What a waste of money. This may be the most overrated, redundant sales book that I have ever read. I can summarize the entire book in one sentence: ""Techniques used in small sales will be ineffective during large sales, and we have the research to prove it."" Don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,Appropiately titled - Spins what real selling is all about.,"I will give the author credit for one thing, he came up with the right title for this book - SPIN because it spins what real selling is all about.Borrow it from you library for FREE and save your money for good quality books on selling or take a sales seminar from people qualified to speak on the subject. Certaintly not Rackham.And don't take these five star reviews with so many helpful votes seriously, just another form of spin; five star reviewers coming back and voting for their own posts to jimmy the ratings of the book and their reviews. Only at Amazon!"
3,It has been a while,I don't recall when I made this purchase and I have not been using it for whatever reason I bought it.
4,spin selling,"The book makes sense and is easy to follow. It is aimed at those selling long term services or making larger sales. It is not the book for someone whose bread and butter is high volume small sales such as retail sales. It is excellent if you are selling or would like to begin to sell legal, accounting, or similiar services."
3,"Not the Be-All or End-All in selling, but a good read.......","I didn't buy Spin Selling, but I did browse it at our local book store. Spin Selling is not new. I have used some of the techniques in spin (Tom Hopkins, top sales trainer in America for over 30 years offers a similiar spin only calls it NEADS and Brian Tracy calls it IADA) and I agree with the consultative, solution based style of selling. However, I disagree with this author in saying that your presentation should eliminate all possible objections and that objections are bad.Neil Rackham offers a soft-selling approach that is refreshing. Probably appeals to the new and amateur type of sales personality. A good read, not the be all or end all or the magic bullet that some try to make it out to be. Also strongly recommend Brian Tracy and Tom Hopkins as well as other books on selling."
3,Ok but not his best,"This book looks from the cover like it would be part of Singer Trilogy from its unusual shape (4 X 8 inches) and pen and ink drawings on the cover and throughout the book. Yet it is written in a completely different style.Instead of being a narrative poem, it is the story of a life - the story of a life told from the perspective of the person's guardian angel. The story is written as though it were true, and Miller found this strange manuscript that disappeared as he copied it.The book chronicles the life of a businessman who lives an unsavory lifestyle, until just before the end when he becomes a Christian. It tells of the changes he attempts to make in his life, both the successes and the failures.It is an interesting read. Yet I doubt the 'Angelic' perspective in the book. The Angel seems too whiny and human to have been an angel and the actual author of the book. I would state that it is an OK book by an author who has achieved greatness in some of his other writings."
1,My Amazon copy of this cd is missing the 11th song!!,I feel totally ripped off.... *O Fortuna* is not on my cd. I heard Therion's *O Fortuna* on a prog station and when I saw it was on Deggial I was excited.... only to find out that the song is not on my Amazon copy of this cd!! BUYER BEWARE!!! You are getting only 10 songs and not the FULL 11 songs!
2,Not at all what I thought it would be,"Listening to the samples of this CD on Amazon.com and reading the other reviews, I was really looking forward to owning it. I must say, I'm very disappointed. I thought the operatic and choral stuff was cool but didn't know it would be on EVERY SONG of the CD and make up the lyrics entirely. The music is simple and just doesn't do it for me. The best song is the one that Hansi Kuersch sings on and that's because it's the ONLY song on the CD that isn't totally operatic with undecipherable lyrics. What a disappointment. I won't be buying any more music from Therion. If you think this CD is for you and don't own anything else by this group, listen to someone else's copy before wasting your money."
3,Deggial,"Therion: Masters of Classical Metal, do it again. Only one problem: no metal. If you are looking for a up to date classical operatic masterpiece you have found it. If you are looking for the Therion you knew in Vovin, or Theli you won't find it here. There are moments when the metal flows, but it isn't often enough. Still this album is wonderful if you love classical music."
4,-,"I would like to note, that if you buy for the first time a album of Therion buy eighter this one or Vovin. Abouth this one; I think it is one of Therion's best albums, just be carefull that you het the one woth 'O Fortuna' song on it, these are the rarest, and 'O Fortuna' (Original by Carl Orff's Carmina Burana) is I think their best song ever. Thue to rigfhts they had to remove it from their album, but those printes with it remaind in stores. So get it."
4,IT'S LIMITED,"TO BAD IT ONLY DISPLAYS SIDE SLOTED TOOS LIKE THE TWINSELECT LINE FACING FORWARD. BUT IF YOU DON'T MINED YOUR UTENSILS DISPLAYED SIDEWAYS, THE QUALITY OF THIS RACK IS EQUAL TO RACKS COSTING 2-3 TIMES AS MUCH."
2,Had to return - didn't work!,"I was really excited to get this server for a big party. Boy was I let down when I discovered it was defective! Apparently there was a short in the unit, it would just cut off. The only way to get it to come back on was to turn the temperature knob past the point where it previously was. For example, it was on Low and cut off. When I turned the knob to Medium, it cut back on. Then about 15 minutes later, it cut off again. Then I had to turn it up to High to get it to come back on, and about 15 minutes later it cut off again. Luckily it was still within the return period so I sent it back. Maybe I just got a lemon. Overall the design was good, I liked the separate trays and covers."
4,Does what it should,I use this as a warming tray for bigger pans instead of serving up the three mini sides the picture shows. Works fine.
5,wonderful,"I bought this for a party I was having. It worked out wonderful. The food stayed nice and hot. The table it was sitting on was un damaged. It holds a LOAD of food. I put in one dish 5lbs of sliced brisket. in another there was 12 small corn on the cobbs and I think the last one just had grilled onions.A friend of mine asked me if I wanted it turned off at the end of the night, I said yes. Silly me didn't check that it was shut off. I had cleaned out the dished but thought the remaining heat was from the unit cooling down. In the morning I realized it was still on and there was no damage at all. I was very happy that it didn't cause damage to my table. Of course I don't recommend that you do this but it was a relief."
2,Cheaply made,"Works well enough, and I appreciate the versatility of being able to use the provided pans or just the flat warming surface but the lids are awful. One was cracked right out of the box, another cracked on first use and on second use one of them actually warped from the heat of the warmer. I'll be returning this and looking for something a little sturdier."
3,Lids are cheap,"Tray and pans work very well - upon receipt, two of the lids were cracked in the middle where the handles were screwed in and one had an edge missing. Very cheaply made. The handles fell off two of them when lifting off food (used once). I have asked the manufacturer to replace them."
5,Truly Five Stars,"I enjoyed the book very much, it is on a level everyone will understand. I hope all the teenagers will read this book, and learn that there is really is a GOD."
1,Don't you think you're a little biased?,"Well I have to agree with seawasp. The only thing I'm seeking is Susan which I bought from Amazon four months ago (recommend it! See my review there). Not cod.Having read ""Proof, There is a Cod"" by Steve Martin (?!) and Jim Trombly some weeks ago, I found myself reaching for the salt cellar to take an extremely large pinch...Authors should try to distance themselves when attempting to prove something otherwise they can't see what others find hard to understand. These two guys are deeper into their faith than a pogo-stick jumper in an irish peat bog.You can see how tolerant they are of other faiths and beliefs by the fanatical response to negative criticism.The other problem with the book I found was not enough pictures, and far too many long words."
1,Hope the recording quality is better,"I recently purchased the Johnny Cash hits CD called 'Columbia Recordings'. The recording quality was VERY poor - not surpising for Columbia. Back in the 70's, Columbia's classical recordings on vinyl were very poor - distorted with lots of pops and scratching noises. I have Verve CDs recording in the 50's and the quality is superb. Wait and buy a remastered CD."
5,I agree - who would have thought?!,"I agree with the other reviewers - I bought this set for the mid-sized measurements and have been surprised how often I use the 2 cup measure! I have the 5 piece set as well and love these measuring cups. The design, feel and long handles are great. Highly recommended."
5,Use Them Constantly!,"This is the best investment I've made in baking implements in years. I reach for the 3/4 and 2 cup measures almost every time I bake. They're made from the highest quality stainless and although I've tossed them around and into the dishwasher endless times, they still look brand new, which is more than I can say for my Cuispro set of standard measures.Now someone needs to make a 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 cup measure. :D"
2,Disappointed !,"Remembering when the newspapers ran a story on Poverty Point, identifying it as a large and meaningful site, in 1955, I was excited to find something written about such a mysterious place. Something a layperson could understand and enjoy. This story, while touching, failed, in my opinion, to include so much of the true wonder of Poverty Point. The lapidarian skills, the questions about the use of the stones we now call plummets, were ignored, so, I was disappointed. Chances are I may have enjoyed it had it been written about another site, which, with no more about Poverty Point actually included, it could have been."
3,Too long for the content and story,"This is the second Gear book I've read. This book has a very slow start. With over 550 pages, it took me 200 pages to have any real interest. The first 100 pages I could hardly follow all the different characters, as they were given a chapter here and then another one later one so I'd lose the thread.Frankly, the book would have been much better if it were only 250 to 300 pages. Even after I got to know the characters, the story didn't move along at a compelling pace. The main character, Salamander, was the only one the reader cared about and was the most developed.The best feature of this book is the historic scene the Gears paint. They make Poverty Point come alive by filling in the details with their imagination. The broad brush strokes are fact, but much of the details are deductions. Regardless, the Gears do help us to realize the wonderful heritage we have right here in North America with the many vibrant cultures that have come and gone."
5,Fab....,"Another engrosing book from the Gear duo. However, it took quite awhile for me to get pulled in. About twelve chapters or so. When I finally did get sucked in I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to finish the story. I do wish I could have found out a completion for the Anhinga character, I felt we were left hanging there for some reason. The other thing I wish would be completed would be the lead-in story lines. otherwise, I love the Pre-historic America series."
3,Difference than most contemporary music.,Good for my collection as it brings in a variety. Recommend it for its difference. Good pricing at amazon.com for this selection.
3,Good introduction to sitar,"Like the other reviewer wrote, Shankar explains the forms of sitar music -- different types of ragas and their rhythms. That keeps this album from being something that you listen to straight through -- it can feel instructional or something you might listen to for school. But, when Shankar does stop talking and just performs, (or once you get used to his talking on the album) the music is wonderful -- very exciting sitar. What else do you expect from a master?"
2,Lesson in Sitar,Quite disappointing CD. There's some dis-jointed sitar music which is interjected by instructons and historical lessons by Mr Shankar. Difficult to enjoy in the normal sense.
2,Diesappointing,Too much instrruction on what a raga ia and the different types. I really don't care about that. I just wanterd music.
1,too much talking and not enough music,"I did not expect a primer on Indian music. I expectd, instead examples of songs in different styles. This CD does do that to a limited extent, but Ravi Shankar spends too much time instructing the audience. The music that is presented seems rough and un rehearsed"
4,OK but...,"As great as the music is, if you are distracted by the presence of vocals...then buyer beware. Ravi does a fair share of talking on this CD...and while the info is interesting enough...some listeners may find the vocals distracting. I would recommend the CD ""Three Ragas"" as the best, vocal-free Shankar CD."
4,intro with narration and awesome playing,"The other reviews are good, so I'll try to say what has not been covered:This recording is like having a 40 minute introduction to classical Indian sitar music - Mr. Shankir talks a little bit about the musical foundation of each piece, illustrates this by playing the ""scale"" of the piece, then plays a selection. There are 4 selections, so about 10 min each. You learn that each ""raga"" is for a certain time of day.The recording is old and thus not as clear as things recorded in the digital age. But the playing is phenomenal. Worth getting if you want a piece of pure, old-fashioned, authentic Indian sitar music. I saw Mr. Shankir lecture back in the early 80s, and figured out that there is much more to this music than can be conveyed in one album - even if he lectured the whole time. But this is a good intro."
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"Took this camping for the 1st time and made rolls in it for dinner (the kind that come in the tube) we didn't wait very long, and WOW we had hot rolls with our stew. I am a seasoned camping veteran and was VERY happy with this oven. It is small, but will accomodate an 8x8 pan. Very nice to have along. Can't wait to make cinnamon rolls :-) If you really enjoy gadgets, camping and cooking - BUY THIS!!!"
3,A usefull accessory,Always handy to have a long useful for biscuits muffins or potatoes if you have the fuel. As hard as it is to get this oven up to cooking temperature it is a useful accessory something that any base camper should have in their kit.
4,it works:),"We are going camping next month, so we bought this oven as an extra way of cooking things (like biscuits.) We tried it out, just to see how well it works. We used it with ourColeman Road Trip Pro Grillwhich we plan on taking with us camping (but also use at home quite often.) As long as you watch the temperature gague(on the front of the oven) then you should do fine, it worked great with our biscuits at breakfast. it also folds up flat which makes it good for packing for a camping trip."
5,Nifty Oven,"This oven worked great! Used it on our recent camping trip on the propane stove from our popup. I couldn't center it on the back burner, but the lower panel dispersed the heat evenly anyway. Even though the temperature gauge didn't get to 400 degrees, the biscuits browned fine. It is heavier metal construction than I was expecting, and should last for many years."
2,rack missing,"This was ordered to replace the same product destroyed in a fire. I've used them for years over a Coleman multi-fuel stove, and they work fine for baking. I was disappointed when the package for this new one did not contain the internal shelf. I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if it was complete."
4,Camp cooking,"This wonderful little oven has provided our family with some great food while we were camping without having to use our dutch ovens. We've made triple corn casserole to have with dinner, banana nut muffins for breakfast and cinnamon rolls that pulled even the most reluctant out of their sleeping bags! Because we camp in a high altitude area, we needed to adjust the recipes and cooking time a little bit, but after a couple of tries, everything is working out just fine. This is a great little oven for those nice things that make a meal wonderful without all the fuss of building a fire or waiting for charcoal for dutch ovens early in the morning. Imagine hot cinnamon rolls with gooey frosting and coffee all done at the same time.I would recommend this for anyone that enjoys some baked items on their camping trips without all the extra fuss."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased Coleman's Camp Oven directly from Coleman. It had damage dents in the lower corner of the front and back panels. Didn't mind, I was still able to put together with only minor difficulty. I wanted to test it before I put it away for our next camping trip. I had the oven temperature gauge holding steady on 400 degrees. On a whim I popped in my oven thermometer. The actual temperature was 550 degrees. Needless to say I would have burnt my biscuits to a crisp. I was totally unhappy. A 25 degree discrepancy I'd live with, but 150 degrees? Unacceptable. I called Coleman, and to their credit, they sent me another oven. But even it was 125 degrees hotter than the gauge said. My advice, DO NOT expect the oven gauge to be accurate. Use an oven thermometer and make it a permanent part of your camping gear."
3,Coleman Camp Oven,"Used this oven in 30-40 degree temps. It it is hard to keep temp constant, was very hard to maintain 350 in the oven. However I wraped the top and three sides in automotive heat sheilding and that solved ALL the heat problems . Overall I will recommend this to anyone who camps regularly ."
2,If there is not other alternative,"We tried and tried this thing and it will not come up to temperature. Big burner small burner. Finally a wrap of aluminum foil helped, more the better looked like the dough boy. Its a task.Look, its fun to use, its just not an oven, its kinda a warm warmer. Yes, given enough tin foil and time it would bake some cookies. Got rid of it. If you use it in a warm camper you have a better chance."
3,Not the best glasses holder,"I bought this figure only because my husband is a doctor. The functionality of this product raises doubts, because none of the glasses I tried fit. The doctor painted accurately, but the overall shape is weird."
4,Perfect for those that love to wear boots,"I bought these because I love to wear boots in the winter but hate to squeeze into tights to keep my legs warm. These do a great job of covering my legs up to my thighs, which is perfect.The only issues I had were during the course of the day, the top of the liner would start rolling down my leg and I would have to stop & adjust every once in a while."
1,Contstantly slip down,"The quality of these socks is nice, but I cannot back them as ""over the knee"" because they constantly and quickly slip down to bunch at your knee (not comfortable with a bunch of material bunched where your knee bends). I had hoped they would work for a knee-length skirt, but I was disappointed. They are lacking any kind of backing or plastic lining on the inside (which I have seen in other thigh high hosiery that really do work) to keep them in place and give them the effect of tights with a skirt. I am tall - 5'9"", but the socks are long enough when pulled into place to cover my knees generously. The problem is the lack of any design feature that would hold them in place."
3,Over the Knee Boot Liner Sock,"The material is lightweight and comfortable to wear. The length was perfect. My problem was the sock tends to roll down the leg and is too constricting. I have varicose veins around my knees and the constriction was like a tournicet cutting off circulation to my legs. If you have varicose veins or thick legs, I would not recommend you purchase this item."
1,Indictment of the times,"A sad and disturbing book that gives an insight into the period of ""civil conflict"" misnamed ""the Troubles"".Murphy and his accomplices committed awful crimes against innocent Roman Catholics,quite stomach churning.I think this book has to be read with a view of the situation that was going on in Northern Ireland at the time.These Shankill Butchers felt that they were reacting to the murderous activities of the IRA who were shooting/bombing/maiming/torturing policemen,soldiers.As during this period the IRA and its allies the INLA were murdering people everyday."
4,I like it!,I would have to say i was surpised to see the ring the day I was to actually get it! I love the ring. It is sooo pretty just what i thought it would look like in the picture. Thanks Alot!
3,Pretty but not happy,I ordered these rings for everyday use. The pacakage was beautifully done in a pretty gift box. It has a nice shine and sparkle to it. But I was unhappy with the stone settings. It makes it look fake. Also the size I ordered is slightly loose on my finger. SO I will exchane/return them possibly.
5,Struggles with a rare form of muscular dystrophy,The eleven-year-old author has prior writings and audios about his feelings of life and his struggles with a rare form of muscular dystrophy: this collection is filled with inspiration and reflections and will attract a wide audience of listeners.
5,Unbelievable!,"If you can't find something you like on this album, then you just don't like music! Melodies, harmonies, great beats, wonderful instrumental renderings, sometimes orchestral, but always interesting with fascinating imagery."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"The reason they write about Jimmy Stewart is, there's nothing exciting happening in upstate Mi. That sums up this played out boring CD. Sorry guys, but Gordon Lightfoot beat you to this type of music and does it much better. Even their name reads like a VFW hall sunday meeting. I'm sure people who injoy Lawerence Welk might enjoy this CD."
4,excellent source of contemporary poetry,"Whether you like SOAD or not, anyone can appreciate this poetry book for its face value. He does a good job at protraying our modern society the way he sees it, and it's damn real... If you like saul williams' ""said the shotgun to the head,"" you should pick this up"
4,brilliant,"but you must be familiar with the English language to understand what he writes ... i have dozens of unknown words, so i can not enjoy it as i want. and probably i can't understand the messages in some poems..."
1,I wish I could give this no stars,"This book of poetry is a great example of why poetry is dying. There is too much of this going around. I was kind of upset with Serj for taking advantage of his new status as a celebrity to get a book of his mediocre poetry published, I rushed out and bought it and I hope you don't make the same mistake I did. Buyer beware, this book of poetry sucks. He was poised to give us a lesson on rebellion and instead took a Cleveland steamer on our chests."
3,It's OK ............,"A very no frills guide. The walk throughs are straight forword and bland, the same character bios as the games manual, no extras at all (the walk through starts on page 4 and stops at 175 , only 176 pages in the book) half decent maps and the walk throughs are as confusing as the game. The book has on cheat codes. It's ok for help but that's it."
2,Fascinating concept; disappointing execution,"The mystery surrounding Adele's mesmerizing sexuality and the decadent secrets of 1930s Paris drew me to this book. Despite witnessing the passions and fears of the book's characters including one of two protagonists, Celia (museum-robbing, sleuthing magazine publisher), the reader never gets to know why these people act as they do. Adele should perhaps remain a mystery, but the fascination behind Celia's relentless search should have been explored. On the other hand, Blanche (Adele's captor/slave/lover) is as fully fleshed as Celia should have been.Overall, I thought that for such sensual (often grotesquely so) material, the characters seem rather cold. It also seems to be missing a final chapter. Very unsatisfying (but was that the author's intent?)."
2,Didn't Come Together,"I agree with the other reviewers that although this book is supposed to be about passion, it did not inspire any passion and came off cold. This book had charming characters and an interesting core idea but it never came together. After a while I was just plodding through it to see how it came out, and then the ending was a disappointment. Good writing but the plot didn't gel."
5,Personal review-Leslie,I read and thoroughly appreciated Ann and Don's perspective having a healthy relationship. Their perspectives help to see how different male and females view circumstances. They offer sound advice and guide you in the right direction to deal with conflict in a constructive manner.
4,An Interesting Novel,"All in all this was a very good novel. I felt that Frederick Pohl had a brilliant vision for this book, and caried it out in full detail. The story revolves around Roger Torroway, a typical astronaut married to a typical wife living a typical lifestyle. However, Roger is involved in a project which isn't typical at all. This project is called Man Plus, and is devoted to saving the human race, (wihch is, the latest simulation says, a ninety nine percent chance of destroying itself within the next ten years.) Man Plus is devoted to turning a man into more than a man. by ripping out most of his biological components and replacing them with mechanical body parts, thus enabling him to live on Mars. The result would make a super being to start a colony on Mars, thus saving the human race. When William Hartnett, the original Man Plus dies, Roger Torroway has to take his place.This novel is full of surprises, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
3,Somewhat Anti-Climactic,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***I like Pohl's work, but this book is more of a novella than a novel; too short, IMHO. The build-up to the trip to Mars drags on a bit, and the actual voyage takes place very late in the day. The events which take place there are hardly exciting, although I did like the surprise ending. Sorry, not Frederik's best."
4,Simply Good!,I adore Barbra's cover of Judy Garland''s Boy Next Door (though it says boy next store-why i dont know) and is just one of the many gems on this album.
5,"Barbra's best album after her ""Second Album"" without a doubt!","""My Funny Valentine"" is pure heaven but by the time she gets to Jerome Kern's, ""All The Things You Are"" you are absolutely convinced you have purchased one of the greatest recordings ever made. Her ""Second Album"" is still the best. Sorry Barb, to my mind I liked you better before you took singing lessons and became a Jewish goddess. ""Color Me Barbra"" your second TV special, I forced my father to watch in the Grill Room at the Army Navy Club in Washington D.C. when it first aired. He called you Barbra Strident as a term of endearment after that."
4,Simply Magical,"One of the most underrated Streisand albums. Barbra's singing voice is perfect on this one - note the quality of her voice on the opening bars of ""My Funny Valentine"" - and as always, her dramatic command of the songs stands unmatched. Equally impressive are her readings of ""I'll Know"", ""Make the Man Love Me"" and ""More Than You Know"". However, her Mae West impersonation on ""Stout Hearted Men"" is annoying :-)"
4,Another strong Raven album,"Not as good as ""Rock until You Drop,"" due mainly to the weak tracks ""Athletic Rock"" and ""Sledghammer Rock."" The stand-out track on this album is ""Run Silent Run Deep,"" which is absolutely awesome. The inclusion of the B-side cover of ""Born to be Wild"" featuring guest vocals from Accept's Udo Dirkschneider makes this a must-buy; I've heard tons of covers of that song, but this one is the absolute heaviest ever. All in all a strong album."
2,Not quite what I expected,"While I am not a scholar on Japanese wood block prints, I have an appreciation for the art form. I was sadly disappointed in the collection which made up this CD. I had hoped for more images of nature, and in brighter colors, perhaps from a different period. The pixal density of the images is exceptional, and I will use a few, but by and large I found the images uninteresting and ""muddy"" in overall feel. More images from the book would have allowed me to make a more informed decision."
4,Mac OS X 10.4.3 Tiger,"This is a great operating system. The spotlight search is extremely useful to find applications, files, pictures, etc. on multiple drives. I don't find the dashboard to be particularly useful as it takes too long to load. I consider them to be more of a gimic that a useful utility.Overall, the upgrade to Tiger is great."
1,"Great for movies, music but that's all.","I got this os with my new iMac, it plays music from a CD, the software comes with none. It plays dvd's. No tutorials to help you get started, it does have some microsoft junk bundled with it. I paid more to get a mac so that I would not half to deal with microsoft. The printed documentation is of little help. My first iMac 9.1 came with a lot of extras, Appleworks, music, movies, and a good tutorial. Also none of my software that I am running on 9.1 will work on Tiger.Not happy with my $2,000 + purchase ."
2,Lacking in Practical Advice,"If you are looking for inspiration or motivation to travel with your child(ren) (or maybe just encouragement that it can be done), then this is the book for you. If you are looking for practical advice, as I was, this is definitely NOT the book for you. I flipped through the entire book in 10 minutes, turned to my husband and said, ""Well, that was a waste of $8."""
3,Flawed and not what I expected,"This product only has adhesive on two of the four sides. I guess this could be helpful for wounds that need to breathe, but I was expecting adhesive on all four sides.Also, when you remove the bandage, the pad separates from the adhesive, leaving the two strips of adhesive stuck to your body. Picking them off is a pain."
4,"Great product, but adhesive is weak.",I used these on my Father's legs before he passed away this June to take care of some scrapes and a little movement would 'dis-adhere' the sides making them flap open.I use them occasionally on myself after working on a car :) and any flexing makes them come loose. But still a good product.
2,Not comfy,"If you're looking for something firm and to keep you alert and perky in the office, this item is perfect for you. However, I have a sensitive derriere and this item is in no way soft or comfy. Plus, it reeks (as to be expected from using a product full of dried herbs). Overall, not for me. Maybe for you?"
4,Can't Fight This Feeling!,"Very clear cut, well done DVD shot before an energized crowd. Its really cool to see older bands like REO Speedwagon still putting out DVD's. Includes all of the well known hits like cant fight this feeling, take it on the run, keep on loving you, and time for me to fly. Reo always seems to be really excited to be performing on stage! This DVD will make you want to stand up and dance! Kevin Cronin's Voice seems to have changed some since the eighties. It seems less strong and almost like he seems to struggle a bit with some songs. If your a Huge Reo fan then you should get the concert video ""Wheels are Turnin"" which shows REO in their prime when they released the Wheels are Turnin Album. Good Eighties well produced concert.This is a must for any REO Fan!"
5,Classic high energy and hopefulness -- Keep Pushin On!,"This is a fantastic live album -- all the songs are played with great spirit and energy. REO has always been a sound for partyin, a sound for hope, and a sound for love. The music was there when I was up and wanted to stay high or down and needed to persevere. This live album brings back those old memories and involves the fans with fun, high-powered rock. The new(er) guitarist really jams with his own unique style and gives the old classics(Dont Let Him Go/Roll with the Changes)a spark and Kevin is simply the great, enduring vocalist and lyricist he has always been -- he cares about his fans and the music and it shows. Thanks for all the years REO, and keep pushing on."
5,CUTTING-EDGE SOUND QUALITY,"This experienced band is known for pleasing the crowds and their performance on this DVD will keep that reputation intact. But the really amazing thing on this disc is the quality of the sound. It pulls off the difficult task of sounding crisp and clean, while still sounding live. And the Dolby Surround mix will make you think you're actually standing in the front row."
3,"OK CD, But These Guys Are Getting Old","I have nothing against this CD, and I listen to it sometimes. However, these guys are getting old. Kevin Cronin's voice is weakening and the playing overall lacks the energy of ""You Get What You Play For."" The live version of ""Riding the Storm Out"" on that album if far superior to this one. I recommend that album first, this one second."
5,Surely will be a prized possession of any diehard REO fan,"""Plus"" was brilliantly shot before an packed enthusiastic crowd in Kansas City, and shows the 5 guys of the current REO and how awesome performance musicians they are. Contains the same show on the Arch Allies CD with Styx, but this is REO on their own and That Ain't Love, Keep Pushin, and Tough Guys were added. They can't stop rockin, in fact they sound tighter live than many bands sound in the studio. It also contains interviews with Kevin and Neal (on the DVD they are separate from the performance), and the DVD also contains 5.1 Dolby sound, and a trivia game fun and challenging for even longtime fans. Highly recommended whether or not you've worn out your copy of the Wheels are Tourin video :-}"
2,Please release 'Live Infidelity',This show pales in comparison to the previous 2 REO shows that now only exist on VHS. :(
3,"Great Recording, But I Miss Alan & Gary","Sorry, folks. While this is a good album, and the boys can still rock, I just don't get the same kick out of this band without Alan and Gary. I do wish they're record some the older stuff, too--even with the current lineup.Chalk it up to old age, I guess.(It's still worth adding to your collection, tho.)"
3,Fine album but for Cronin's voice.......,"REO is notoriously outstanding in concert, not just in how they sound but they really give their all and nice to see them still ""rockin""....but what is up with the lead singer's voice? Not that it's ""bad"" exactly, and granted he's no spring chicken but it sounds odd, too high, like some teenage kid or something, and he clearly can't ""belt it out"" any more. As with like many classic rock singers nowdays, it's sadly too clear how past his prime he is. This for me really took away from the tracks. Understand I take no pleasure in saying this, love the band, just my honest opinion. Maybe it's time to retire after all."
5,Outstanding,"If you are a lover of REO Speedwagon, then this DVD is a must. The quality and sound is as though you are part of the concert. This is the best live collection of REO songs that I have ever purchased. These gys really know how to rock. The energy is non stop and they play all of their top hits. Once you start watching, you will not put it down."
2,The title doesn't say it all,"112 images of disparate subjects as seen reflected of a myriad of objects including puddles, mirrors, windows, and canals among others.All shots were taken in Italy in what can be descibed as an impressionistic style.The human form dwells in most of the shots, although the shadows are so large an the details left so fused in the waves of reflections within many photos that the impact of the work, overall, is confusing, without the sence of city life one tends to see in the works of the great photographers like Kertez, Brassai & Atget among others.The reflections are literally there but they fail to convey the rich imagery one expects to find in a fecund place like Italy and its great cities, where the photos were taken."
2,Watch the fingers!,"I bought this toy for my 10 month old son thinking it would be fun with the different shapes and music. I usually sit and play with him cause he is too small to put the pieces in the right place, however, one day when I was not playing with him he grabbed the toy which was open and it closed on his finger. Luckily it did no long term damage but very disappointing especially with a product from Little Tikes. I think it's a fun toy just be sure to not leave it where your child can play with it without supervision."
4,Great for 12mo+,"We bought this toy for my son's first birthday. To begin with he just loved to have us place the shapes in the holes and then push them in the rest of the way. At about 18 months he started putting the shapes in himself.While it doesn't provide hours of entertainment, he has continually gone back to this toy over the past 10 months and I expect that he will have fun with it for a while.He also likes to carry around some of his other toys in it. I think he sees it kind of like dad's briefcase.As for downsides on the toy, I can see the potential for pinched fingers. We've never had that problem with this toy. Our son has always been conscious of his little fingers, but I know most kids are not. Also, he has difficulty opening the case once it's been closed."
2,Boating at night = video of pitch black and some voices,"It was almost so boring it was funny. The majority of the video was exactly what the title states, ""Boating at Night"". The problem with this is that it makes a horrible video. It should have been a n audio book, and most of the footage is pitch black with a couple people discussing some of the dangers of boating at night.Was it useful? I'm not sure... I fell asleep."
5,fascinating mini bios of the eccentrics throughout history,Anyone who loves biographies will enjoy this book. There are many fascinating biographies of famous and not so famous eccentrics.
1,BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!,I bought this because of all the great online reviews. It is by the far the most expensive mistake I have ever made! It claims that it is so orgasmic that you will happily prefer it over sex. Ha! I used it until it over heated and still did not even come close. I used it while watching porn and it still could not bring me to a climax. I am amazed that it has good reviews and that Dr. Ruth endorsed it! I think my electric tooth brush has more power and that it would probably be more climatic. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME! The Hitachi Magic wand is waaaay better!
4,Beautiful Watch,"I bought this for my wife, and she loves it! It is elegant and slim, and looks great with practically everything. The hands are a bit small, which makes it difficult to tell the time ""at a glance"", but my wife assures me that she got used to it quickly, and was never a big deal.The clasp is a bit difficult to work out of the box, but it loosens up pretty quickly.One quick note: If (when) you need to resize this watch, take it to a jeweler!"
5,Pretty!,"I haven't worn a watch in years because I simply haven't found one pretty and delicate enough to earn my admiration. This watch does. I'm so pleased with it. It is very elegant, sleek, simple and sparkly! I'm tickled. The hands are a bit small, with no numbers on the watch face, but it doesn't bother me at all. The band is rather long, so if you have small wrists you'll need to get it sized. I was worried that the face would be too long for my small wrists, but it is not. It's a pleaser. You won't be disappointed."
3,HP Media Center m7260n,"My computer shipped about a week EARLIER than I expected. Unfortunately, it came preloaded with soooo much extra junk - games, trial programs, miscellaneous internet provider links etc, that it does not seem to run that much faster than my old AMD Athlon 900 mHz processor. The Media Center features are cool, especially since you can use the remote. I do find the My Music feature to be rather cumbersome, but then again, I haven't read the manual on how to do it properly, either! I think that if an advanced user has trouble with initial setup, then a rookie will have bigger troubles."
1,overpriced,I recommend Citrus Magic. It is an excellent product. It works better than anything I have ever tried. But I will not buy it from this seller ever again. It is way overpriced. This is not the 7 oz. can but the 3.5 oz can. Other sellers at Amazon are charging less for the same thing.
3,"Thin material, but cute","This is a very thin rug. Not comfortable to step on at ALL. However, it IS very cute. So I just use it as the mat in my garage that I step on before walking into the house."
2,There are better travel books on Florence & Venice,"This book confuses succinct, targeted travel information with ""informationals"" about those who may have paid to get in the book. It is not a well organized book."
1,junk,This trap is an absolute piece of junk I have had other have a hard crap that were made of sufficiently strong wire this one is much too weak to hold anything of any strength the first time I use it I don't know what I caught but whatever it was it escaped by bending the rear door locking bar squeezing out under the backdoor. They may make a trap that has stronger caging material but this one I wouldn't trust for catching a field mouseplease pardon my syntax and word composition as is related to the Dragon
1,Raccoons outsmart this trap!,"We have a koi pond in our backyard. Recently we noticed that there was a critter, possibly a raccoon, trying to catch the fish at night. The water plants were turned over, the netting we put over the pond was torn and fell in the water. So we bought this trap and set up the bait at the far end of the cage. The baits were taken twice but the trap door did not close. So we tried again by tying an additional string to the bait and the hook of the trap door release, hoping that when the bait was taken, the trap door would close. This time the bait was taken and the trap door closed without trapping anything. We found that the bait was probably fished out from the top of the cage as the bait was tied to a string. We either have a very smart raccoon or the trap does not work."
5,Works fantastic!,"Length:: 0:28 MinsThis cage works fantastic. Very easy to put together. We've caught 10+ strays in our neighborhood and had them fixed. We've caught cats in less than one minute with the trap. You simply put some delicious canned kitty food on one end, set the trap, and they can't resist! Check my video for a < 1 minute catch we had a while back! The kitty was in our neighbor's yard, but very much feral. We set the trap on our porch, and had him about a minute later!None of our strays have been hurt by the trap, either! Great product."
3,call it 3 & 1/2 star,In two settings I caught two cats no problem. I'll give it 3 1/2 for not being quite as heavy duty as I thought it would be. For my purpose it worked fine but on two more settings the dead end gate got pulled inward by what was likely a good size raccoon judging from tracks I found in some mud. In that case it got a snack of dry cat food and got away. That's OK. My target is stray cats. I can only hope the trap wont come apart while there are still any cats around.
3,trap works well but Tractor supply has a similar one for a much better price,I am happy with the trap but wish i had visited the Tractor Supply Company and received a similar trap for 30% less money
5,Works great!,No instructions were included so I had to assemble it from the picture on the box. The first night I put it out I caught a stray cat using just Doritoes and Funions for bait. I am buying another one to catch more stray animals on my property. These things work great.
5,Very Pleased,"very pleased with this purchase. Set up without a problem. Collapsible feature easy to do and great for storage.Highly recommend this trap.I caught possom,skunk, 2 squirrels,easily."
2,Defective,I ordered to capture the stray cats out here that get dropped off. I can't get it to lock. I finally gave up and asked for an exchange only to find that that window expired. Not happy with item at all. Useless if it won't latch.
5,Quick Shipping. Great Product,Shipping was extremely fast and trapped an opossum the first night. Easy to use and set up. Would recommend this product to anyone looking to trap a nuisance animal.
5,Works well and easy to store,"This trap works very well. I've caught six stray cats so far on our property in about a month. The directions are well-written and have easy-to-follow diagrams. The trap has plenty of room for the cat, and there is no way that it can escape once in. The spring mechanism is just right -- the door has sprung only when a cat steps on the release plate. (Even slightly jostling the cage doesn't set it off.) I opted for this model over the Havahart 1079 because this one collapses for a smaller storage footprint and is just a few dollars more. It's been in continuous use, so I haven't tried collapsing it yet and don't know how difficult it will be. In a hot or sunny location, I'd suggest putting a piece of cardboard on top in order to shade any trapped animal until it can be removed. My only regret is that I had to purchase this at all because of some irresponsible cat owners."
5,Stray Tom Cat Is History,"Stray tom cat had taken up residence at my house, making my other cats nervous all the time and afraid to go outside. Plus, he had figured out how to use the kitty doors and was coming inside to eat. I could rarely actually see him, he was really wiley, but I could hear him and smell him (UGH!!). With the racoon trap I first caught two of my own cats -- they were not injured and then they stayed away from it. Baited it one more time and got the stray tom that very night! Very satisfied. This situation comes up now and then, so I'm glad to have a ready solution."
4,Works like a Champ,"The produce was easy to erect, although instructions are a must for a newbie. Was able to get more looking at a picture of it than reading the instructions. In an effort to catch a couple of racoons who frequent my garage I set it outside with some cat food in it. The first night, sure enough caught the family cat, who meowed all night long in it. The next night I caugt a possum, since wife didn't know how to cook it, I took it down to a wooded creek area and let it go. Still trying to get those coons, but they're smarter than the average cat or possum.."
2,Does The Job But......,There are many traps to buy & this will do the job but they make easier traps that aren't so hard to set.
1,Havahart 1089 trap,"The one I ordered had one major defect: the sides were slightly bent inwards. This prevented the easy opening of the rear panel, i.e. one would have had to insert several fingers to pull out the panel while holding on firmly to the frame. Imagine doing that to release a trapped raccoon (which is what I intended this trap for) - the animal would have bitten off one's fingers. I sent an email to Havahart describing the problem and asking for advice but they never responded. I then returned the item to Amazon's vendor. To be fair, I am not sure if all the Havahart 1089 traps have this problem. But I never order another as I couldn't face the hassle of setting it up and, in case of a similar problem, having to return it as well."
3,"Good For Cats , Not Raccoons","The trap worked the first night, but the Raccoon bent the cage door and get out. The next night, same thing.I'd recommend something more substantial for Raccoons, good for cats (I caught mine twice) and other small critters.The cage did bend back into shape, so it still works."
2,"Worked well,..but...OUCH..sharp edges!",The edges of the cage caused a few scratches upon assembly. Assembly was OK...a bit difficult to follow as the diagrams/pictures were often on a page other than the verbiage. The trap worked well. Someone stole the first bait that I put out (bacon and chicken) but the Swiss cheese rinds caught the opossum that I was after. Unfortunately (possibly due to sharp edges) there was a fair amount of blood in the cage.
2,food gone and no animal,"The weather here in Philadelphia has been very cold and snowy. I bought this trap to catch one of my cats that is outside and wont come in. We keep setting the trap, the next day the food is gone, but no animal in the trap. Followed all the directions. Was a pain putting together, but I think we got it right. I don't know if we are doing something wrong or if it is the trap."
3,"Works, not all that durable, though.","We've caught several critters with this bad boy. Groundhogs, possum, and just a couple weeks ago, a raccoon. It's done a good job of catching them, but after the first couple catches, I've noticed that the hook doesn't seem to grab quite right when you're setting it, so it's really a hair-trigger. It's been set off by wind before. Sometimes it just slowly slips."
1,Useless for trapping raccoons,This trap is only good enough for catching squirrels. Raccoon escaped several times by putting pressure on the trap door and squeeze out of it. The idea that this could happen while I were transporting raccoon in my car to the nearby park is very disturbing. Do yourself a favor - hire professional help or shop for another trap. This trap is big disappointment and waste of your time.
1,Hasn't caught anything,You have to setup and build the trap yourself. Everything went fine with the build until I had to setup the connection between the plate spring and the trap door. The metal hook had to be bent to get into the loop on the trap door mechanism. The plate that springs the trap is not sensitive enough. I baited the trap with some chicken bones and noticed that something had gone into the cage. It pulled the bones outside of the cage without springing the trap.Bottom line: so far the trap has been ineffective and I would look elsewhere for a better trap.
1,Cat Trapping Fail,"I liked this product for cat trapping. An infestation of cats emerged and the animal control failed to help and would rather deal with barking dog complaints from idiot neighbors than deal with nuisance cats, so I had to take this matter in my own hands.This cage helped at first and I was able to catch multiple feral cats but after that I was disappointed that the latch mechanism wouldn't latch anymore because the cheap metal became loose, therefore making this product useless. A waste of my hard earned cash, especially wasted on insignificant beasts."
1,Held a raccoon for an entire minute.,"Set up the 1089 trap with cat food. Aimed my motion-detector video camera at it. At 1:00 AM a medium sized raccoon entered it, ate some food, triggered the trap, turned around, and pushed his way out under a corner of the trap door. Hardly slowed him down at all. See the actual escape, caught on a motion-detector camera, here:[...]"
3,Missing Part,"My Model 1089 trap was missing the u-shaped lock for the rear entry. I can't believe their qualiity control is so lacking. I called Havahart customer service and they were going to send me the part. I asked if they can express ship it, but they can only send it by ground. Their shipping center is in the East Coast and I am located in the West Coast. It has past 4 business days and no shipment yet. I did not want other parties to wait for my bad luck anymore so I will stop by Home Depot to pickup a trap and return this one. Not all Home Depot care traps so call to make sure."
2,Not the best.......,"When I first received this trap it seemed flimsy but I figured that it would work for my needs. The first night... 1 small baby raccoon. After getting rid of that raccoon I noticed that the trap door was bent but I was able to bend it back into place. Second night another baby raccoon but this time the ""release door"" was bent inwards. I fixed it and set it out the next night. I checked the trap in the morning and noticed that the ""release door"" was nearly pulled right off of the trap, and of course it was empty (must've been mommy). In my opinion, this trap would work well on cats and other less aggressive animals. This trap is not sturdy enough for raccoons as they are too aggressive and destructive. I threw this one in the trash and ordered a Tomahawk Live Trap and WOW what a difference in quality."
3,Trap with a catch,We received the Havahart 1089 trap and immediately put it to work. It caught a sunk and a raccoon but the second raccoon we got some how got out of the trap and was blowing sweet nothings in my husbands ear. We are not sure how the raccoon got out in the car. Otherwise it does trap the animals.
3,I caught the intended cat but it escaped,"Set up was not that difficult but takes some time to figure it out. I should've search youtube for instruction. Someone posted instructions on how to set this model 1089 up.I placed the trap where I knew the cat would pass by. I caught it on the second day.However, I was so disappointed when it escaped. I had to climb a waist high wall to get this trap to my garage. While trying to carry the trap with one hand, the trap tipped down when the cat moved to the front end of the trap. This trap is quite heavy and unstable when an animal is inside it.The cat was frightened and it struggled to get out. Somehow it was able to squeeze out of the front door and escape. I was so disappointed. I don't know if I can still catch it in the future. He may not enter it ever again.My advice to you is to either get a better heavy duty trap or somehow block the front door from opening with some rod or clip or tie-down before lifting the trap (once you caught your target animal)."
4,Stray cat Trap,"Once you get this together it is wonderful, easy to use.We caught the stray cat hanging around our chickens the first night.We also were able to catch a possum that was lurking around our chickens at night.I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,No Easy Release,"It traps animals very good, but the release is very difficult. It takes both hands to open the flap gate. It does have a rear door release but, that is not easy to use either. They now have a new easy release cage, which if I had known would have bought instead."
3,Not good for multiple uses,Used this trap for groundhogs. First one went fine. Second groundhog actually bent the cage a little trying to get out. The third groundhog actually broke the back of the cage and escaped. Not the sturdiest material.
2,Not too good for armadillos,"Bought this unit to trap a nuisance armadillo. It worked to trap him, on the second night I set it out. Unfortunately because the construction of the unit is too weak, the armadillo was able to bend the metal, open the door and escape. Too bad."
2,Review of Have A Heart trap we purchased...,We found that the mechanism that closes the trap (a curved spring) is too strong. This results in the trap door closing quickly and violently. While it is true that the animal should be beyond the point beyond where the door comes down - and therefore safe - that may not always be the case. In our case we were trying to trap a mother cat with kittens. If one or more of the kittens follows her into the trap and she trips it they could be injured (or worse!). I realize that the object of the manufacturer is to have a mechanism that closes quickly and securely but this just seems too strong. We purchased a True-Catch trap that we saw at the local Humane Society and that we liked much better!
4,It sure does the job!,"Once you get the trap set up (the hard part), it works GREAT! I've caught several critters so far and very sturdy, strong trap. 3 of the raccoons caught were aggressive and feisty trying to get out of the trap. I was worried that the trap would give way but so far, it hasn't!I'm very happy with the trap, now if I could just get rid of my raccoon problem, I'd be very happy period. I gave it 4 stars because of the set up...the directions enclosed were not clear and a bit confusing."
5,Caught That Stray Feral Cat,We had a problem female stray feral cat that ended up in a neighbors attic which meant we had to remove part of the facia to let him out. We later saw his daily route - placed the trap with a little tuna fish in a small bowl - and got him. Humane Society picked her up - spayed it and another neighbor picked up cat for a pet. Great trap - easily used with great results.
4,Does what its made for,"The trap is decent size, the trap door works fine. The construction does feel a little flimsy but is still holding together. I just recently trapped a mom of 3 kittens, I did not use the trap door. I used the back door, connected a couple of strings to it and manually closed the door behind her. The trap door does seem strong, one concern would be getting a tail or another cat/kitten trapped under it.UPDATEHave caught 8 cats in it. Did not use the auto shut door as I believe it may harm the animal especially if another animal attempts to go in behind the first one. I have attached lines to the door and manually close the flap when I see the cat is safely inside. Takes time and patience but they deserve it."
4,Excellent trap for cats and opossums,"Despite some negative reviews, I decided to try this trap for the feral cat in the neighborhood. Although the trap arrived with minimal assembly instructions, I was able to put it together without difficulty. We caught a good sized opossum on the very first night that we set the trap. It took quite a while to lure the feral cat into the trap (tuna juice did the trick), but we did finally succeed. All in all, I was very pleased with it. The fact that it collapses down flat for storage is a bonus. Most of the negative reviews concern racoons. Maybe this is not the trap for them. However, it IS an effective trap for cats and opossums."
2,Traps 'em but they still get out.,I've had 3 raccoons escape from this trap. The first one tore the back door off. It's held on by two hinges - I reattached it and strengthened it with 4 more hinges I made from wire coat hangers.The next two were somehow able to put enough pressure on the trap door to be able to squeeze out of it. The only way they can't get out is if I re-enforce the top and sides of the cages with big cement blocks.
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk. The gauge of the wire is too small. A squirrel has no trouble bending the back of the trap enough to escape. A squirrel also has no problem bending the top of the cage upward sufficiently to release the latch on the trap door on the front so as to escape. A racoon has no difficulty doing either of these two feats as well as generally deforming the cage so as to open multple paths of exit. The seller pridefully asserts that the cage is made in the USA, so I guess junk can be made in the USA too."
4,Does the job!,"I'm involved in cat rescue, sometimes needing to trap outdoor cats so they can be neutered. These traps do the job, reliabily and consistently!"
2,"Interesting topic, ineffective writing","Having just started to read about Jungian psychology, and taken an interest in the concept of the shadow, I approached this book in anticipation after reading Robert A Johnson's 'Owning your shadow'.While Johnson's book was concise and to the point,and very enjoyable to read, this book has been a boring read after the first couple of chapters. The ideas presented are sometimes repetitive and at other times just do not gel. You feel that you've read a profusion of sentences with a sprinkling of punctuations in between but with very little new information or insight as you go from page to page. I don't think I've learnt much, in theory or in practice. Will go to Debbie Ford's ""The Dark side of the Light Chasers"" now and hopefully find a more satisfying read."
5,Thoughtful AND Dangerous,"I studied this book years ago, and began to explore hidden aspects of my psyche. The quest leads into territory that is not without its hazards! This is a Jungian-based work, and Jung himself wandered in lostness for quite some time as he explored the hidden aspects of himself. One final note: If you pursue an exploration of the dark side, know that some others will feel threatened, and some who feel threatened hold the power to punish. Guard your journals and do not carry them through Customs stations lest authorities read them (they can, you know). Save yourself some embarrassment, at the least."
1,Not Piano Friendly,"Though this book (and the series from which it comes) seem editorially sound, they are totally useless as working piano scores. They are small hardback books with print so small they would only be good for notation."
4,Great Music,Unless you have heard the soundtrack and agree with the previous reviewer don't pay any attention to it. Chris Michie was a great talent as anyone who is framiliar with his music and bio would know.This is a great soundtrack.
5,Inspirational poetries for the mind of a Xtian,"In the world of today where the word ""kool"" is not associated to christianity, this book brings back the ""kool"" factor. This is an inspirational book that's good for early morning read to kickstarta new day, or at night to give you the re-assurance that you are on the right path being a christian.This is not a book to be read and assume ""done that"", it's one of those few books that you read each topic over and over again, thinking you are reading that topic for the first time.But of course what do you expect? It's full of inspirational write-ups."
1,The drawbacks to this item outweigh the benefits.,This product is nearly impossible to clean and sanitize. There is really no good way to clean it without it bending in weird ways and the bark breaks off. If not cleaned correctly it is the perfect hiding spot for parasites and will mold easily.Snakes prefer hides that block more light than this hide can in order to feel safe. Something that touches them on all sides is much better.
5,Grim going.,"Much is still said about the Nazi houlocaust, and well that it should be. Little seems to be said about the millions that Stalin and his fellow garbage starved and shot to death in the late 1920's, particularly in the Ukraine. This book ought to be on the reading list of every high school student.Things like this need to be put out in the open and remembered. It wasn't too many years ago that western liberals were excusing the soviets behavior all over the place, and pretending that things like this never happened."
3,Good but not Great,I just finished this book and can say that my #1 issue with it is layout. The idea is to show poses and tell you what is right and wrong with them but almost always the image in question and the text are not visible on the same page so you have to flip pages to see the image you are reading about. Another issue is that in later chapters you will read posed according to the rules we established earlier in the book but I don't feel that the early chapters clearly define all those rules so I wish the text was specific to each image.
3,Mike,"Decent book, but may be a little too simplistic for the advanced photographer. I found some good ideas, but was looking for a little more direction on difficult people to pose, etc."
1,Really Bad,"Sorry, I was hoping to find a constructive or gentle way to title my review. However, I just can't. The photography in this book is bad (frequently bad light, bad subjects, horrible backgrounds) and the posing of the subjects is frequently laughable for what is supposed to be a 'good' pose. Plus, the organization of the book is terrible. For what is supposed to be an educational book, these shortcomings take it from sub-average to unacceptable. What a waste of money - I bought the book in a hurry in a camera shop. Never again. FLUUUUSH - that's the sound the toilet made with my $35USD.DO NOT buy this book.Amherst would be so much stronger a house if their titles were CONSISTENT - some books are good, but so much garbage. Can't trust 'em, may as well not pay for it. Find a good website or blog and learn it for free."
1,Very Disorganized!,Sample pictures do not have a clear description of which poses are good or bad. You have to read text which is usually in different pages to determine the expalantion of the poses.Writer is not clear in his explanations and is hard to follow.I will not buy any other books by this author.
1,Not at all what I had hoped..,This book did not have the creative and interesting posing techniques I had hoped for. Outdated is the best word I can think of to describe this book.
4,HP BT450 + HP DJ 6980 + ipaq hx2495,"Although my printer was not explicitly listed as compatible, it did have the USB pictbridge port so I figured it should be ok. I wanted to add BT compatibility so that I could easily send documents from my IPAQ to the printer.The only issue I have found is that I am limited in the file types that can be printed, for example: my Word docs have to be changed to .txt before they will print. My guess is that is a limitation of my printer's pictbridge since photo files such as .jpg print without a problem.In conclusion, I am happy with my purchase."
2,Range could be better,"Seems that they're a bit off on their estimate of how far this reaches. I've set up my MAC about 10 feet from it, and the bluetooth receiver doesn't pick up. Meanwhile, my bluetooth keyboard can be picked up across the apartment.Nice to have the wireless option though."
5,nitabw,"This was the best purchase ever. The HP BT450 Bluetooth Wireless Printer and PC Adapter has made printing from my laptop and cell phone possible from anywhere in my house: so convenient, I can print pictures directly from my phone; GREAT!"
2,Bluetooth,"I recently bought this product and it was not working on my printer and computer. I am not sure why, it is considered plug and play. I sold it on ebay recently."
2,Does not fulfill promise,I bought this adapter thinking I would be able to print documents from my pocketpc. I installed the adapter to my 6300 hp printer only to find out that you can only print images. I was not completely satisfied with this adapter.
1,Baffled in Florida,"Even though my HP printer manual says this should work with an iPad, it doesn't recognize the HP 6310 All-in-One Officejet printer. Therefore I feel like my money was wasted unless someone can tell me what went wrong."
1,Not compatible w/ Windows 7,"Buyers beware! This is not compatible with the Windows 7 operating system and there aren't any updated driver files that you can download from HP's website. Unfortunately I found out all of this the hard way...after buying it and trying to set it up. When I saw that it wasn't working properly, I researched a little more on HP's website and found out that it isn't compatible with Windows 7. This information should be given with the item description."
4,"Works, but not as easy as they say.","It's not just a plug & play. It took a bit more manipulations before we could figure out how to get it to work. Finally there, I do like the convenience of being able to print on the printer downstairs while I'm working on the laptop upstairs."
2,Doesn't Cut It,"I bought the product with the intention of printing from across my house. The room I'm printing from and the room with the printer aren't separated by any walls, so there shouldn't be a problem. Checked the manuals and it said there was a range of 30m. Took the measurement and found it to be only 50 feet, about half the distance that was advertised. I reconfigured their positions, and still nothing would work. The printer didn't have a problem as it's brand new and ideally should work, but nothing good has come. I resorted to the old fashion USB way. Another miss by HP."
1,Not compatible with Mac,"This product has been misrepresented since they say it's compatible with HP printers, however it is not. I purchased two of these to connect my MacBook Pro to HP Officejet 7310 and too late read in my printer's manual that it can't be commected wirelessly. What a let down! Not what I'd expect from HP."
2,It's Aparently the Wrong Class unit,"Currently I am in the market for a good Bluetooth adapter for my computer. However, I also want to have it able to meet up with my headphones I use for my LG-500, as I move around my shop all the time, so ten feet will not cut it.I have checked around for something which would state whether or not this is a Class 1 or Class 2 device, but just can't get anything to positive identify it. However, all the bad reviews lead me to conclude that this device is a Class 2, which is not what I want. Class 1 adapters will reach out to around 100 metres ideally, and Class2 adapters only about 30 metres at best. So my recommendation is to get nothing but a class 1 for a stationary unit.Based upon what I am reading here, I will not be getting this adapter, for obvious reasons: I want to get distance on my reception."
2,Wrong USB Type!,"I bought this Bluetooth adapter to print from my laptop without cable. When I received the adapter I couldn't plug it to my printer because, as a lot of printers, it only had a type B USB port, when this adapter is a type A male requiring a type A female port on the printer. Maybe I should have known this, but the product info should also have told us about this possible occurence in its specification and warn us. So I cannot say whether it works or not, because I first need to purchase a gender adapter (A female to B male) which only costs 1$90, but because I didn't find it in shops I'll have to order trough the net and pay shipment for that. Just another silly waste of time and money."
4,Good resource for both tourists and locals,Great ideas to help you to figure out where to go in NYC. just follow each route... very helpful !
5,A Thoroughly Good Read,"Readers of science fiction, romance/mystery novels or military exploits will welcome this addition to their book shelves. In the style of Tom Clancy, Cullen offers a thoughtful storyline that weaves elements of all three genres into a compeling and provocative tale based on the premise of a new constitutional convention, the great and would-be great who seek to subvert it and the very human characters fighting their plot (and, not-inconsequently, finding love in the process). I found it thorougly enjoyable and satisfying; the type of novel that can easily find its way to a screenplay and movie."
1,"Flat, Shallow, and Tepid","Cullen takes several interesting premises: a second constitutional convention, a global economic crisis, the fall of the Republican and Democratic political parties, an attempted military coup, the rise of a new Pan-Arabism; and does absolutely nothing of interest with any of them. Plot, characterization, background, and writing are all two-dimensional at best. Cullen's efforts to create depth to his characters and pathos to his story are remarkably clumsy and wholly ineffective. The most I can say about this book is that you can at least take it to a used bookstore for some trade credit."
4,In Deep Voodoo,"I love good mysteries and this was a good one. Obviously not James Patterson quality, but good nonetheless. I am looking for cheap mysteries to put on my Kindle and this was a good one."
4,Entertaining and Full of Mystery,Must read this with Voo Doo or Die. They are both fun novels with both mystery and romance. Love the location and all the quirky characters. It was a fun easy read.
2,"Free book, but the time spent was almost too high a cost","Free Kindle book. Well-enough written that I didn't stop reading it as light entertainment, but it's not terribly surprising to find that she got her start writing Harlequin romances. The mystery is just there because it's the genre she picked - it's not very well crafted. And the soft-core porn is embarrassing."
4,Page turner,I had a hard time putting it down. This was a good book with a twist I didn't see coming.
5,What a great read!!!!!,"Being a HUGE fan of Stephanie's Body Movers Series, I was not surprised at all that this book was such a hit! If you enjoy books with a little adventure, mixed with comedy, and a little romance then Stephanie Bond will not let you down. I will for sure continue with this series, and will be anxiously awaiting the new book in the Body Movers Series."
4,Witty funny and crazy,"Right.. don't be in a serious mood when starting in this book and stay open for all kinds of crazy things.. !!! It's one enormous dish of spaghetti one can only dis entangle when it nears completion.. and even then the end is unexpected and yep.. crazy.. Reading the books of this writer assures oneself of an enjoyable read ! On to the next one.. with yet another smile on my face, because of the witty sentences and the funny use of 'words'.. voodoo or die, here I come !"
4,Easy Read,Just a funny easy read with colorful characters and farily good plot. Loved the New Orleans setting and the vodoo references.
5,Stephanie knows how to work her mojo!,"I really enjoyed this quick and funny read, yet the main characters were well-developed and the plot twists were genuinely unexpected. The Voo Doo segments were well-researched and authentic. I am looking forward to the next of the series."
3,It's okay,"""Voodoo"" was a fast and easy read and perfect for the beach. But the main character is not nearly as much fun as Stephanie Plum in the Janet Evanovich books. She is, however, a health food nut so, as a reader, you didn't want to dive into fried chicken or donuts. I was content with a cup of tea!"
5,TOTALLY AWESOME.,"LOVED THIS BOOK. THE MYSTERY HOLDS YOU TIL THE END. AND VOODOO, LOTS OF VOODOO. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
3,Wrapped Up A Little Too Neat and Tidy,I have to admit I almost stopped reading this book after getting about half way through because the main character couldn't catch a break. It was just one bad thing after another and I was getting very frustrated. I pushed my way through the rest of the book and was left a finale that was a little too neat and tidy. I didn't get a sense of a build up to the finale and the finale to me had no link to the rest of the story. Yes the author wrapped up the loose ends but I didn't feel satisfied with the ending. The only reason why I'm giving it three stars is that the author did give me main characters that I really liked.
4,Fun story.,"This is not a deep book, but a lot of fun. Great to enjoy after a hard day at the office."
4,Fun,Fun book to read. Entertaining with many good characters and a good pace to it. Kept me interested the whole time
4,In deep voodoo,"This book was a fun, easy read. Kept me entertained. Will read the next book of series. Then try more of her books."
3,Cute...,"This was a cute little story I downloaded for free. I usually don't read mysteries, but this one had enough humor and madcap situations to keep me interested. The low star rating is due to my personal preferences rather than the author's writing style. She's good, just not my cup o tea!"
3,On the fence,"I enjoyed this book. It was light hearted and fun to read. It just was a little too explicit in the sex scenes for me. I have downloaded multiple Stephanie Bond books because they all sound like fun reads, but I am not sure now. I am going to read one more and see what I think before I jump to deleting them all."
5,"English Cozy, but American style!","I enjoyed this book with its engaging story because it is engrossing yet not too gory or heavy on details. It's characters are detailed enough without too much clutter. Kind of an English cozy, American style, near the ""Big Easy."" I like the writing style and can finish it in three or four sittings. Very entertaining. Thanks to Stephanie Bond, as it is not always easy to find an author consistent and that can keep my interest. Goodie 2Shoes"
3,Opine on In Deep Voodoo,"I find the book interesting as well as the characters. There were times of predictability and slow pacing. Overall, it was entertaining and worth the time to read."
4,In Deep Voodoo,"This is a light enjoyable mystery with likeable characters and humor. Penny the heroine is a bit much when it comes to being a heath food nut, and she seems to make some dumb choices that get her into trouble, but how else can you get her trapped into a scary situation. Her leading man BJ is an interesting guy. Throughout the book you wonder about him and want to know more. If you are looking for a light,entertaining read, try it. It was definitely worth the $0.99 I paid for it (on sale). I will read the next book in the series.In Deep Voodoo (Mojo, Louisiana humorous mystery series #1)"
4,Campy MoJo lol,"This was an entertaining, campy book. The characters were pretty well developed and the story was fun enough with just a bit of mystery that kept you entertained. Not a serious book by any means and not a whole lot of dramatic scandal going on, but it flowed enough that i was able to say hmm interesting. I didnt enjoy all the extensive detail that the author gave of the surroundings. i understand she was creating an atmosphere but some of it was tedious. But despite that small hiccup, I enjoyed the story and will read the sequel."
3,An easy read with a bitter aftertaste,"This book starts with a lighthearted approach to a familiar story-- the ex-wife trying to make a new life with her ex and his new love living across the street from her business. The characters are well drawn, if somewhat implausible, and the heroine more than a bit self-righteous with her insistence on healthy living to the nth degree. The solution to the mysteries is unsettling, and what seemed like an atmospheric cozy mystery turns into something quite different and much darker."
4,Voodoo good,Love the humorous voodoo of this story. In Deep Voodoo is a fun mystery that won't disappoint. Now I'm off to read the sequel.
4,"Good, fun read","In Deep Voodoo is a fun story with twists and turns right up to the end. The main character, Penny, was funny and very likable, finding herself deeper and deeper in a mess with everything she did trying to find her way out. I would definitely recommend this book to friends and will continue reading more by this author. Enjoy!"
5,Very entertaining,Loved the book and characters!!! Can't wait for the series to further develop!!! Awesome read with characters worth reading about again!!!
3,In Deep Voodoo,"This book was entertaining. I would put it almost in the romantic category. I bought it based on the humorous title, and it was worth the price."
2,Very Disappointed.,"As a fellow mystery writer, I hesitate to write this review, especially because I really enjoyed the first half of this book. But I was profoundly disappointed in the ending. Half way through, it became clear this was a romance novel dressed up as a mystery, complete with pretty explicit sex scenes that pulled me right out of the story. The proof was in the ending. The author breezes right past the resolution of the crime, and then glosses over an even more horrendous crime than the one which fueled the entire book. The villain(s) are just dumped into the ending and/or not identified at all, but sure enough, the romance is wrapped up with a neat little bow. I believe that when you spend more than two-thirds of a book building up to a big ending, you need to deliver. Too bad. I thought I was going to love this book."
4,"Great suspense, kept me guessing","I thought several times in this book I had the mystery solved... I didn't. This story will keep you in suspense. Good characters, great plot. I am anxious to read the other book in the series."
5,In Deep Voodoo,"Classic Bond, Stephanie that is. I found myself laughing out loud yet engaged in the suspense. The characters are delightful, believable, and some are just fun to hate. If you like this book, don't miss Voodoo or Die. It is a nice continuation of sorts and is the gift that just keeps giving. Brava Ms. Bond. When can we expect #3 in the series?"
4,Fun Suspenseful Murder Mystery Romance,"Interesting characters abound, led by a great protagonist accused of her ex-husband's murder after playfully stabbing a voodoo doll. Secrets abound in Mojo and the protagonist accidentally gets caught up in them. Nice style, some humor, rather grisly ""solution "" to the crimes but no egregious or disgusting details, just references. The Romance aspect is as prominent if not more so than the suspense and the overall tone light enough that the reader knows all will end well, making it a lightweight, pleasant read."
3,A ruefully wry review,"I liked the fun way Stephanie Bond writes but one critique: PLEASE STOP USING THE ADJECTIVES ""RUEFUL"" & ""WRY"" AND IT'S VARIANTS! Jeesh, it's like Dean Koontz and his obsession with the word ""preternatural!"""
3,Fiendishly fun,An easy read with some twists and turns in a different sort of setting. You'll never look at small towns the same way.
4,"Good book, great plot","Great book, good plot, keeps you reading the whole way through. I hope that the third book comes out soon."
4,Great Read,Really enjoyed this book. a fun easy read that was hard to put down. Can't wait to read the next one.
5,Couldn't put it down,Really enjoyed the book. It was difficult to put down. Was too curious to find out who the killer was.
3,A light and easy read,"A little voodoo, a little romance, a little mystery. Not an epic read, but enjoyable. Some of the characters were not as developed as I‘d like, but the main story was cute."
3,"Overall, an uninspired set....","I purchased this disc after getting and loving a few of Roland Belmares' other mixes. Here, he begins with some very hot vocal tracks from Dynamix and Dolce, but surprisingly, segues into repetitive beats of nothingness in the middle of the disc. Track 7, Hornetz, is literally an instrumental version ""in da ghetto"" by the bad yard club-which sort of lifts you up a bit and makes you want to dance, but then it goes right back to snooze-worthy beats. The saving grace is the final Rosabel mix of a Pat Hodges diva anthem. Too bad the rest of the compilation wasn't this aggressive. Track times:1. My Body (7:02)2. Feels Good (5:52)3. Drum Key (4:51)4. Party Time (6:04)5. Are You Ready (5:34)6. One Ticket to Chicago (7:31)7. Hornetz (5:49)8. Strong Resemblance (5:49)9. Feeling Hot (6:55)10. Saucy (6:46)11. Saving My Love (9:30)"
5,"Fast Paced, Witty, Satisfying","Published more than 25 years after the first Nero Wolfe novel, this outing by Rex Stout shows that the author had not lost his touch. Too Many Clients is the story of a corporate executive who kept a secret apartment for various sexual escapades. The executive is murdered, and suddenly Nero has many clients: the corporation, the widow, the couple who own the apartment building where the murder occurred, and a woman who was one of the murdered man's visitors. In typical Nero fashion, the detective figures out how he can make a lot of money solving the case. Also in typical Nero fashion, he fails to tell Archie some of the information he receives, keeping Archie in the dark. That doesn't stop Archie from making delightfully witty remarks. A very enjoyable read."
3,dog booys,"Cute product. Arrived sooner than I anticipated, great condition, great price for an item I had a hard time finding online. Very pleased."
3,Beware: Sizes are confusing,"I ordered ""small"" for my wife, and boy they werent kidding. They were actually child's size (tiny). I ordered another pair (XL) and will give the first pair I ordered to my niece."
1,Childrens socks!?,"We didn't realize these were toddler size socks, as it does not state that anywhere. We bought these for my 13 year old in a small and they are toddler size socks or children's. They should have this information listed."
5,A most impressive work,"A tightly argued piece of criticism, deploying close reading and sustained analysis with equal skill. Since it deals neither with my discipline (history) nor my period (early modern England), I must take much of the later book on faith; but the first chapter on John Locke seems both incisive and accurate. Obviously scholars of poetry will be interested in this book; I think scholars of rhetoric would also profit by taking a look."
4,It works great on shoulders,"I wake up quite often with a stiff neck. I have purchased other products from different catalogs but I have never had one as good at this. It works great on my shoulders, and my neck. This is one of the best buys I have ever made."
2,The head fell off after 5 minutes,"Worked okay for the first 5 minutes, then the head fell off. Next day, I tried to glue the head back on, but no luck because it is a two piece nylon screw assembly. I sent it back for a refund.If you get a unit that stays together then it should be good for you. It seems solid, easy to handle and powerfull."
3,accuvibe massager,"I had an old one that was no longer holding a charge and ordered a new one that I thought would be the same. It looks the same, but it does not have as powerful a vibration. I prefer my old one . . ."
5,"Small, powerful, and effective.","This is a great vibrator, excellent for people with neck and back problems, easy to use and lasts a long time on a single charge."
1,"Don't bother, poor quality control, doesn't last long",I'm in the process of returning the third accuvibe I have bought this year. This one failed to charge after the second use. The other two lasted about 2 months each before their charging systems stopped. Going back to the Hitachi.
2,disappointed,"Product arrive quickly, but when opened the fabric had torn at multiple seams resulting in holes all over. The fabric was so thin in these places that it had actually unwoven and could not be fixed. Returned it the same day."
2,Snow White Evil Queen,"For the dollars spent, if you aren't close up, it looks like the picture. However, I would have rather spent more money to have better quality."
2,Did not fit,"Had to give to a friend, but she looked great in it. Thought this was the Maleficent costume but realized it was the Snow White Evil queen costume."
3,Head piece too small,"The head piece for this costume was too small. I don't have a big head by any means (I'm only 5'5). I could barely get it to fit correctly around the face and when it did, it left the whole back of my head open and exposed my hair. Other than that, the rest of the costume was in good condition and fit well."
3,"good selection, poor organization","I liked the selection of poetry in this collection, but I don't like how the poems are organized by theme rather than author. Many of the poems, of course, engage multiple themes, so the organization system is really a bit reductive and, for that matter, scattered."
3,"Stylish, but awfully chilly","No other pop divas in the 1960's took time away from their hit-making schedule to do a French-flavored album of chilly love songs but our Barbra. I didn't care for her incessant over-dramatizing in two of my favorite songs(""What Now, My Love?"" and ""I Wish You Love"")but ""Clopin Clopan"" and ""Martina"" are blissfully pretty. An uneven collection, but certainly worth a listen. The curious cover shot seems half a drawing, half a photo, yet encapsulates '60's Barbra in all her would-be French glory."
1,Shrill and unpleasant,"I ordered this for my wife because she had found a LP record at a garage sale and I no longer have the technology to play records. I was very interested in hearing the album because of all the great reviews I read on-line. What a disappointment! Barbra sounds shrill and the recording studio sounds like an echo chamber. I have never been a Barbra fan, but I was willing to give a listen to what was advertised as some of her best work. Clearly she is a virtuoso - few people can make their voices do what she does. The only question I have is why would anyone want to?"
2,Bonafide Snooze,"Love Barbra's voice, can't stand the songs on this album-totally boring! I own a copy of every album she's released I believe but this one? I think I played it once, and once was enough!Rejane"
4,A lovely album!,"This is possibly Barbra Streisand's first experimental recording, in which the songs recorded are sung in French and/or of French origin. While it was not an experiment that paid off initially (Barbra even joked on her latest tour that it only went gold about 40 years later), the end result is a beautifully sung album.Almost all of the songs are sung with a great passion, that makes even those of us ignorant of the French language truly feel what is being said. This is especially true on ""Ma Première Chanson"" (notable for being her first songwriting venture), a swinging version of ""What Now My Love,"" and ""Clopin Clopant,"" where her enunciation of the syllables alone can make your hair stand up.Admittedly, this album will need time to grow on you. It isn't a Barbra Streisand essential by any means, but any fan will appreciate her beautiful voice and phrasing. All fans will want this."
4,For cricket lovers and even those who are not sure about cricket,"This fabulous history of the Ashes in 1981 sets the event against the social and economic climate of Thatcher's England. In a time of race and class riots, of disillusionment and divisiveness, Botham's heroic recovery after the captaincy is taken from him is uplifting. And the unlikely camaraderie and respect between the rough diamond Botham and the elegant intellectual Brierley is inspiring. Well worth watching - even for those who are not 'cricket tragics'"
3,This book was writen for repulicans,If you want to read how many times a man can talk down John Kerry. or just bad mouth Demacrates. then this is your kind of reading.
4,A Rarity in Our Day!,"Regardless of how you feel about Zell Miller, I think all would have to agree that it is unusual in this day for a politician, albeit a retired one, to speak from the heart. I enjoyed this book on a number of levels. As a conservative, Zell's stance on abortion, school prayer, government's role, etc., ring true with me.In addition, I feel that Zell is a throwback to the days of partisan participation. Unfortunately, in Washington, he did not have anyone that felt the same.This was an enjoyable, quickly read book."
1,"One need not read past the ""Forward by Sean Hannity...""","That alone should tell you what type of book this is. It's another screech by another discredited psuedo-democrat who has become unhinged. As a real democrat from Georgia, I can tell you that Zell Miller hasn't represented the Democratic party in Georgia for years.How can you trust a someone who praises a genuine war hero in one speech and demonizes him for partisan point-scoring in another speech. He simply cannot be believed or trusted.But hey, I'm sure Sean Hannity (another completely discredited partisan ideological right wing hate-monger) loved it. So there's your audience Zell.But as someone who has been betrayed by him and his so called senatorial representation, I do not recommend this book."
1,An apt title,"How apt that Zell Miller who has no decency should write a book with this title. Although I must admit that I could not read the entire book, I would recommend that everyone grab an airline barf bag and read as much as they can stomach so they can see Zell for the disgraceful excuse for a human being that he is. Someone needs to put him back in his strait-jacket and force-feed him his medication until he is ready for polite society again.Having said this, I do wish him a long and healthy life so that he can experience what happens to Emperor George Bush's tools (or should I say fools) when he's done with them. I have no doubt that history will judge him for the hypocritical, mean-spirited wingnut that he is."
1,Waste of Money,I thought this was poorly written and a complete bore. This guy is more of a nutcase than I thought! Don't waste your money.
1,Project much Zell?,"What is the saying about attacking others when you have a splinter in your own eye? Zell Miller is the classic example of a man left behind by history, and the irony of his being helped along that path by Sean Hannity is priceless (or even the penny this book can be bought for used on this site). Still I admit I wished they had left Zell's original title ""My Struggle"" intact and also the translation from the German isn't as sharp as one would like but still this book is a vivid snapshot of when conservatism embraced the worst of the old south and offically became the party of bitter old white men and uh Sarah Palin. Congrats."
5,Beacon of Insight,I'm a lifelong Democrat and agree with Zell's trumpet call for a return to decency. He rakes the extreme left over the coalswith his penetrating analysis and witty yarns. Great book!The book will make Zellmeisters cheer and wild eyed Democrats deeply ashamed of the appalling leadership displayed duringthe 2004 election.
3,"If you have a laptop, this won't work!","Paperboy was always one of my fave games growing up, so when I saw that this PC arcade game had it on there, I couldn't wait to get it! However, when I did get it, all that I got was a screen that would freeze when I tried to play. It does work on my childrens' desktop computers, but not laptops."
5,You want to read this book . . .,"What an incredible true story. Once you start to read it, you don't want put it down. We find the author, an American Permanent Resident, trapped while visiting Iraq and then forced to serve in Saddam's army. Ten years later he is thankful to be captured by American forces, but then we find that the Americans are not sure what to do with this ""strange"" POW. Given our current involvement in Iraq, with proper marketing, this book should be a best-seller."
4,Truly Unique,"Such an impossible story is made possible in this truly unique story of Shant's journey home. Each chapter draws you closer to the end, but also to a new beginning. Shant has done an excellent job making the reader feel as if they are along side him on his journey, and his attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend getting a hold of this book, (just make sure you start reading it with some time on your hands, once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down)!"
5,"A guide to warriors for 2,500 Years","Ralph D. Sawyer's translations is a must have for anyone studying military thought and theory or martial arts. This translation brings to the Western reader the ideas set down by these wise men of the past. My friends who do read Chinese say this translations is one of the best English versions. Many business professionals like to say how ""Business is war"" and use these warriors' thought, but here the Saywers show that the ideas set down in these classics are for the warrior and especially for peace. A lost business deal pales in comparison to what a warrior faces when he/she looses in combat. These seven classics are a wonderful guide to one who wishes to live a martial and peaceful life."
4,Well writen,"I, for one, enjoyed this book. I am not here to critic, as a few of these other reviews appear to be. One, the book is easy to understand and follow. Meaning, the translations are well recorded. Two, I have recently been curious in Chinese history of warfare and this book was able to show me much Chinese philosophy towards warfare. I recomend it this book to any follower of military history or Chinese warfare. You get your moneys worth."
1,Not worth the paper,"I find it to be a shame that this book has even been published. For starters, out of its 340 pages, 233 are simply unannotated API (J2ME Profiles). The remaining 107 pages are a very shallow description of Jini and J2ME, hardly providing any practical advice about use of Jini on small devices.Book's examples assume knowledge of Jini and RMI and lack any explanation. There are numerous errors and many inaccurate and misleading statements.I was truly disappointed with this book, and feel obliged to share my opinion."
2,No good compared to other paper sleeves.,Paper is too thin. Wrinkles easy. Also expensive compared to Memorex brand which is much thicker. I usually pay $4.74 per 100 pack at Walmart.
3,OK for the price,"The price was good, but the paper is a bit thinner than the slightly more expensive sleeves I had been buying. While I am not dissatisfied with the product, I probably would buy a slightly heavier brand next time."
4,They do what they're supposed to.,"These sleeves protect the DVD from scratches just fine, they don't offer much protection against breakage but for the price they work for me."
4,Maxell Paper Sleeves,"These aren't the sturdiest sleeves available, but they are just fine for what I need. Price is good too. I expected somewhat better quality associated with the Maxell name but I can't complain, they do the job.Last brand I bought before this was Memorex. Similar quality and price. I am hesitant to buy no name brand sleeves with bad reviews so I will stick with these or Memorex."
1,"Just like using white Saran Wrap ""THIN""","These are the thinnest sleeves I have ever seen and I do not recommend them. For Quality, I give these a ZERO. They are is thin as saran wrap. [...]. I give these to the 5 year old to make little projects with. I would place the worth of these at about $0.99 per box of 100. And For what I need them for I wouldn't buy them for that. The 5 year-old loved them~"
3,good buy!,good buy for what I needed. may want to consider some hard cover cases if storage method is not as secure.
2,Way too thin,"I should have listened to the other reviewers who said the paper quality was too thin. I thought it wouldn't matter much to me, but it does. This paper is very cheap, not even worth the $6.00. I know it's just a paper sleeve, but you can find better quality for cheaper."
3,I've had better,They made these sleeves out the thinnest paper they could get away with. The similar Memorex sleeves are noticeably thicker.
3,Inexpensive,"These sleeves are noticably thin, not as thick as other sleeves I've purchased for more money. But they suffice and protect my DVD/CD's. They are cheap too."
5,Excellent product !!!,What can you say about CD/DVD Paper Sleeves. They do the job and that's the main thing. I'd buy again when I need more. Thanks Maxell .
3,Paper CD Sleeves,"This product is fine but frankly much overpriced. I have bought several of these packs and they are way too expensive. Amazon offers a 1000-pack for not much more and I will go that way next time. Still, if you only need a hundred or so, these do the job."
3,OK...,I got this 4 my b-day and it was very fun until it broke after about 2 min. It just stopped working!!!! The next day we returned it and bought a new one. It suffered the same fate as the last! It was also very noisy. I would reccomend the Vectron Ultralite by National Geographic. It makes less noise and acually works.
1,SO SAD!!,"This is a really cool idea. I read all of the directions because I know how finicky these things can be with the charging of the batteries and longevity. The first one we had worked for about two minutes and died. Nothing brought it back to life. After returning it and getting a second one, we were VERY DISAPPOINTED that this second one only worked for two minutes at a time. It lasted for two more days and then it died.It is such a neat idea, if only it worked. So many toys these days are very disappointing and this one will surely disappoint any poor child who receives it. Please save your money and your time. Did I mention that this product is VERY DISAPPOINTING?"
1,big disappointment,After one flight around the living room it lost power. After recharge it never got off the ground again. They don't back up the product --once the package is open they can't accept returns (as stated on their product website)!!!! Spend your money somewhere else.
3,Awesome toy for two days,"This was the best toy this christmas! It is so much fun, for kids and adults. A four year old would be able to master it and love it, maybe even three. The one big problem is the toy lasts for about two days, as the motor is so small the bearings wear out or motor dies, and the fun is over. If only they could make one that would last."
1,Don't buy this!!!!!!!,"I would've rated this item a ""0"" if I had the option. (My mistake was not reading the other reviews before I purchased it!) My son had been dying for a Hovercopter ever since he first saw one demonstrated at the mall. Unfortunately, he was extremely disappointed on Christmas morning when his brand new Hovercopter simply flopped over and died. Wouldn't fly, wouldn't spin, wouldn't move. Occasionally you could get it to twitch; that's it. Now I'm stuck waiting in the Returns line at the store! This product was a total flop."
3,Fun while it lasts,"My 7 year old son got three of these for Christmas. He had a blast with them for about 3 days. They would hover up to about 30 feet in the air and he could control them well enough to keep them out of the trees. Now, just a few days later, all of them are pretty much useless. The styrofoam bodies took quite a beating to the point that none of them work any longer. These should be considered a disposable toy."
3,this book needs some editing,"I was attracted to this book because I'm a woman and a cat-lover. I do not know anything about the author but based on review quotes was expecting excellent, entertaining writing. The content is engaging enough, but I noticed that she seems to retell details more often than I suspect she intended. Forgetfulness perhaps? In addition, many paragraphs seem poorly constructed, with her rambling on as though she's just thinking aloud. I'm just a bit disappointed and would not be likely to seek out her other works based on this."
3,A lot of Marge and not so much cats,"I was hoping this would be more about cats since I am researching writing a cat book, but instead it was a great deal about the author Marge Piercy, her entire life, in fact. Since I was unfamiliar with her work, reading her life story in such detail was of little interest to me, although I found parts of it -- the struggle to find time to write and balance a marriage at the same time -- interesting. But her chapters on her cats, especially when they were sick or dying, moved me greatly. I ended the book crying since Oboe dies in the last chapter, and forgot how long it took me to get to this very moving part. So...if you are interested in the author, you will feel like her friend by the time you finish. If you are interested only in cats, skip around to the chapters where she focuses on them."
2,"Whining is not an attractive quality,","even in a writer of Piercy's stature. By the time I was a quarter of the way through the book, I was bored. By the time I was finished, I was ready to write Piercy off . . . but then I re-read her poetry, and was hooked again. So what if I didn't enjoy the story of her life? She probably wouldn't enjoy mine, either. But seriously, this is one autobiography that I'd rather pass in favor of the fiction and poetry."
4,A refreshing change from many autobiographies.,"Ms. Piercy shares with us her life - unsanitized, unpasteurized, in all its naked glory. She does not attempt to present herself as Saint Marge, but unapologetically offers her humanity. From her childhood in Detroit, through stints in Boston and California, then finally back to lovely Wellfleet, we see a brave, intelligent, strong woman struggling to live her life to the best of her ability. This book is an inspiration - I recommend it heartily to all women seeking to engage fully with life.Ms. Piercy addresses the cats who have populated her life as completely as she does any of the humans. Animal lovers will understand and appreciate the love she exudes in print for her four-legged family members.On the negative side, she sometimes jumps around from topic to topic, a bit disjointedly...but I pretended I was having a conversation over coffee with her, and the writing style fell into place."
4,Rich and Captivating,"SHANNA is a captivating tale by master romance storyteller Kathleen Woodiwiss. Finding herself in situation where she must marry before her father's return, Shanna goes to a prison to find herself a doomed man to marry to appease her promise made to her father. She selects Ruark Beauchamp; a man set to hang and in return promises him her body. They marry and she quickly reneges on her promise, leaving Ruark to return to his cell.However, Ruark finds himself purchased to work in the Caribbean where Shanna has also returned to live. Working on the very land her father owns, Ruark is thrust back into Shanna's life. Their passionate embraces haunt them both and Ruark is determined to collect on the promises made to him by Shanna.This wonderful story is steamy and immensely rich in historic detail. If you are looking for the perfect balance of romance, sensuality and history you will find it here!"
5,READ THIS BOOK !!,"If you love historical romance do not miss this book. I repeat, DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK! You will never forgive yourself for it's one to savor and to be read many times. And then read ""The Flame and the Flower"" and ""The Wolf and the Dove."" These three books are treasures."
5,Another all-time favorite!,"I think I've read this one also six times, along with The Wolf and the Dove and The Flame and the Flower. I have read all of these over 20 years ago, yet they still maintain their appeal. My best friend and I loved this book so much, when she got pregnant, guess what we named her daughter? What else, Shanna. Her husband never got a voice in the vote! LOL Now she's a freshman in college and I told her she has GOT to read this book! I would recommend this book to anyone, romance reader or not. Roarke has got to be one of the sexiest characters I have ever had the pleasure to read. But then as I've said before, like Beatrice Small, I will ALWAYS read a Kathleen Woodiwiss novel, even though I am into a different genre of reading now. Every now and then, you need a good romance novel."
5,My Favorite Love Story,"Shanna is the most beautiful love/romance novel that I have ever read. Kathleen's writing in this novel is superb. The two main characters are strong, dynamic people. You really feel for the characters and their situations. Shanna is what all of us secretly want to be, beautiful and rich. Ruark is every female's dream and my champion. The book isn't mushy. Lots of exciting things happen to these two. It's a book that I couldn't put down and that I read at least once a year. If you've never read Kathleen, read this book first."
5,Shanna,"One of Kathleen Woodiwiss' great books. This author was one of many who started the historical genre back in the seventies. A haughty heiress, a handsome hero, likable friends, an intense romance and even a band of pirates make Shanna a fantastic read. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and consider it one of my favorite books!"
5,Ruark... Drool Worthy,"Shanna ..This book is self titled for Shanna a selfish girl, not yet a woman but likes to think she is. Through half the book I was rolling my eyes and thinking if I put my husband through what Shanna did to Ruark ..I would be looking for a spanking...um now that I think about that ummm..nevermindRuark saved this book for me he reeked with uber sexiness (and I may be partial because Ruark's character did remind me of my husband) Rurak was kind but hard when needed be Shanna was wishy-washy through out most of the book till the pirates isle. You watch the maturing of Shanna ,the dedication of Ruark and other stuff happens as well (don't want to spoil the book for others) Its a great read> I can't be sure that you will like the character of Shanna , but you will drool over Ruark"
4,good book,"this book is a good book, it was interesting and it was a sweet love story. and i looved Ruark, but at times shanna just got on my nerves. she acts like such an arrogant spoiled brat i just wanted to slap her. but the ending is really sweet and i still liked this book anyways, but ashes in the wind and the wolf and the dove are better."
4,Laughing out loud,"Shanna was wonderful! From Orlan's muttering to the names Shanna calls Ruark, the book had my giggling along with Ruark at many many points. This book isn't only humorous,it's beautifully written. You only need to close your eyes to be on the sandy beaches of Los Camellos. Ruark's infuriating made me smolder and grin at the same time. Both he and Shanna are breave enough (and stubborn enough)to get what they want, and fight all they can for it. This is a great read for those who love the dashing and arrogent men, the beautiful and stubborn women."
3,Classic romance of the '80's.,"This is the kind of story that lingers in the mind. Overall it's the journey of Shanna from a spoiled girl to a mature woman. Good, but ""The Wolf & the Dove"" was way better. I'd forgotten that KEW loves using an overabundance of flowery prose though. I had to skim some of it so I could finish the story."
1,THE MOST BORING ROMANCE BOOK EVER,"I wished I had believed the bad reviews (I usually trust the average rating). I'm a veteran romance reader and this is BY FAR one of the most boring books I've ever read (and I've read more than 70 romance books -regency, contemporary, medieval, fantasy, paranormal. I keep two types of shelves: the keeper shelf and the regular shelf, to reread in the future to see if my opinion changes. I threw this book in the garbage can."
3,Not As Good As I Had Expected,"Hmm...I don't know. I'm a big fan of KEW, but this novel wasn't one of those 'feel good' books. Rourk was fine, but Shanna? She was snippy. I simply couldn't get into the story. (Sorry)"
2,boring,"I am a very avid reader and this book could not hold my attention. It was actually a struggle to finish. Shanna resists WAYY too long and it seems like page after page of her pretending she hates him and him pursuing her. I mean, that all good and fun, but not for hundreds of pages! There are much better books out there, so I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one"
3,Avid reader-,I have not been able to keep my interest in this book. The story seems rather unbelievable and a little silly. I have found some of her books excellent and this is not one of them.
2,Shanna,"I was most excited to read this book, for I had heard that it was very romantic. It was not. Shanna was a most spoiled and unlikable character. So much so, in fact that I couldn't stand to finish the book."
5,It was good but...,"Shanna was not deserving of a man like Ruark. By page (300 and something) I was outraged. I was so angry with Shanna. She was so immaturel. The reason why I gave this book 5 stars because, it definitely held my attention. I was really unable to put it down and I am not a avid reader. I started out reading Shanna first, because of the previous reviews this book had gotten.I'm glad I did and will continue to be a reader of KW. She is an excellent writer. Now I am reading the Flame and the Flower. I have strong feelings about this book as well, but I am saving my reviews until later."
3,dismayed,"First of all i would like to say i really thought the plot was good, i mean it had alot of promise, but most of all i was dissapointed alot by the heroine she started off really nicely but as the book progressed, i felt that she was too haughty for her own good and even after she betrayed rourk twice, and in the worst way i fail to imagine how he could still love her that much, i mean i know love is blind but enough already, rourk was intelligent and handsome and hardworking, the only thing shanna had going for her was her beauty, if you ask me, that is not enough to make a man go through hell and highwater for. It was a good effort but i really did not see what all the hype was about."
2,Simply Bored with Shanna,"I would consider selling, giving, or doing just about anything for a character like Ruark in my life! Pampered Shanna continues to refuse him throughout the book giving a tired complaint about his lack of station, position, and birthright. Despite the earnest, mutual attraction that frequently dispels her control and leads to physical and seemingly spiritual intimacy, Shanna still refuses Ruark. Despite his frequent success at saving her pride, reputation, and life, Shanna still refuses Ruark. By the end of the book, I didn't have any respect for Ruark, either. What a disappointing read!"
3,"If you learn what to skip, then the second time around gets 5 stars","The good stuff in the other reviews is definitely there. But if you actually read all of the cut-and-pasted dithering of the heroine, you may find yourself enraged. Once you've made a first pass, though, and know which parts of the story to skip - this is a great one for the keeper shelf!"
5,Very romantic,"First time I read this novel was like 30 years ago. And this is my ""to go"" novel. Read it many times. Named my daughter, Shanna. And recently , met a couple , the guy's name is Ruark. His mother also loved this book, so she named him Ruark. This novel will be read all through generations..."
4,Get lost in the language!,"One of my all-time favorite books! It has been years since I first read this book, and I found myself voraciously flipping pages. Shanna is a strong female character, and I like that she's so self-confident and fights for what she wants. She isn't the typical helpless female character in historical romance!"
5,LOTS OF EXCITEMENT AND ROMANCE,Hot! Sexy! Can't put it down - waiting anxiously for Shanna and Ruark to finally get together. First time I read the book was over 20 years ago. Have read it multiple times since - the book is falling apart. Bought it for my Kindle.
5,Great book,I have read this book several times and it gets better every time. It is in the top 3 from Kathleen Woodiwiss.
2,Shanna is a spoiled brat!,"I read this novel back in the 70's and loved it! The passion scenes were so appealing then, but as I've grown up, Shanna comes across as a rich spoiled brat that a man like Ruark would never fall for. Story line is a great one, but Shanna's attitude sets the women's movement back 100 years..."
4,my namesake,"So often when I meet people, they inform me they have read this novel. My name is Shanna, like the title character in the book. I figured, why not read the book I'm not necessarily named after, but the reason the name was in a baby-book my parents read thru in the first place. I had never before read a romance novel, and although it is at times very cliched, I enjoyed it all the same. I found the female lead to be at times infuriating, but she gained some strength the further I got into the novel. Ruark is a great character, evolving back and forth from a wild man and a gentleman. The plot line was exciting enough, but I was surprised at how long the novel is and how long it took me to read it. This book has a crazy amount of subplots - pirates, murder, love affairs, running from the law. Reading a book with my name in it was an interesting (albeit odd) experience. It made me connect with the female lead more than I might have otherwise."
5,A great story,Iwould highly recommend this book if you love historical romance. I love a book that goes into details....and this book does. I also love a book that goes into detail after the couple have settled down together and again this book does.
2,Yawn,"This is my second book that I have read by Woodiwiss, and I have found her books to be too long to the point of frustration. I think that most romances solve the problem all too quickly in the last 3 chapters and throw in an epilogue for the reader to tell them that the hero and heroine are doing great and now have a wonderful baby. Woodiwiss takes the opposite track and goes way overboard with the length with which the characters fall in love/wrap up problems/etc. After reading 200-300 pages of the same scenario between the Ruark and Shanna, I'm ready to give up! I did end up trudging through the rest of the book and can 100% agree with other 1-3 star reviewers in saying that the book falls short in these main areas:1. Painstakingly long (feel free to skip chapters!)2. A heroine that the reader hates3. Repetitive scenes with little to no movement of the story lineI will not be reading another Woodiwiss book, because while the characters may change the other downfalls do not."
2,Boring,"I liked the beginning of the book but quit reading half way through. Can't see why the hero would be interested in the heroine. Yes, she's pretty and rich but has zero depth of character. Will give this author's other books a pass."
2,"Love Woodiwiss, HATE Shanna","I adore Kathleen Woodiwiss, but I am here to finally confess my hatred for Shanna. I just can't stomach the super-spoiled, willful little witch who is the main character. That said - this is one of the finest authors of early so-called ""bodice-ripper"" romance. Don't judge the book on my account - especially if you like super-willfill heroines."
2,I do not understand the appeal of this book.,"I found the style of writing too flowery. To describe it as melodramatic is an understatement. Also, Shana was annoying. I must say, the only good part of this book for me was the hero. Now HE was something!I think I'll stick to Judith McNaught, Susan E. Phillips, Patricia Gaffney, and others.I recommend: ALMOST HEAVEN by McNaught and LADY BE GOOD by Phillips and TO HAVE AND TO HOLD by Gaffney!"
1,I am sorry to say I too am named after this book.,"Although I enjoyed this lustful adventure when I was fifteen, the shallow romance does not spark my interest any longer. Maybe my problem is that I have never been a fan of romance novels, much preferring anything that more closly resembles life, or science fiction that has nothing to do with reality. I picked up this book again last month hoping to reminisce on why I liked it in my teenage years and understand a little more of why my mother liked it enough to name her first born after it, but I was at a loss. I found the first chapter positively ridiculous. I continued anyway hoping it would get better, but was not rewarded. There was enough fluff there to kill a person. By the thrid chapter I had to quit, and had my roomate rolling on the floor with laughter at the cliched language and preposterous events. I just hope my sexual encounters can't be described so cheesily. Ruark, I hate to break it to you, but you will never be this Shanna's hero."
4,"Pretty watch, good value",It's a tad smaller then I thought but it is still worth the price!Would recommend for sure! Bulova is a good watch :)
2,Amateurish production/great performance,"Turn off the TV and listen to this DVD. Image quality and composition are the worst I've ever seen on a professionally released concert. Given that bassist Rodby had full access to the band for setups and camera angles, his directorial choices seem all the more bizzare. Add to that lame video effects reminiscent of the dreaded ""toaster"" and you have quite a dissappointment on your hands. Stellar band peformances and audio quality make the visuals even more junior-varsity by comparison. To see beautifully shot jazz, check out the Dejohnette/Hancock/Holland/Metheny DVD as well as Keith Jarret Trio, Live at Open Theater East. Being a huge PMG fan (I've seen 4 of their live concerts over the years) I was really counting on this DVD to be a front-row seat. But given the choice between this disc and the balcony, I'll take the balcony."
4,Good Live Performance,"Imaginary Day album is very interesting (and good) simply because PMG uses lots of different sounds/instruments. It's just neat to see how they play these different instruments, etc. I recommend this DVD if you like the music album. It is always interesting to actually ""see"" them play.I put 4 stars because this performance is recorded outside on a concert in CA. Some of the camera shots aren't good but this is just a minor thing to me. The sound quality is still good + pictures are clear and that's enough to make me happy."
1,Great Music - Awful Video,"Too bad the the images, film direction and photography were not on par with the music. The sound quality is outstanding, but the video is downright BAD! Many scenes were shot looking at the backs of the subject being shot. Other times I thought my TV was broke when there were many seconds of total black and no image. Worst of all was the amaturish usage of every concievable video gimmack in the book. It was hard to look at this music video for more than 15 minutes as the shots bounced around so often and never gave me a chance to settle in and enjoy the concert. Did I mention that the composition and camera angles were not well thought out either. If you are looking for a really good DVD get the WE LIVE HERE, LIVE IN JAPAN. I wish I could get my money back for this non professional attempt to record a concert."
1,Not a happy fan...,"When I ordered this DVD, I expected a show, much like the one provided on the 'We live here, live in Japan' DVD... NOT.All that is on this DVD is music with a picture accompanying each musical piece. I'm a Metheny fan, having all his albums on 33 1/3 plus CD, even got the PM Songbook. But had I known that this was nothing more than music and pictures, I would have never bought it. Of course, I had to take it out of its package to witness the desaster... so, no refund possible.By the CD. And beware of the DVD..."
2,Is this a Pat Metheny video?,I'll make it simple. This great music deserves a far better video production.Steve Rodby: please stay with what you know how to do best!
1,Dry rotted,"The steering wheel cover shipped quickly. When I went to put it on my steering wheel, it all broke apart. It was dry rotted. Pretty disappointing, but they were quick to refund."
1,"Hooooooooooorible singing, great songs","Are you people kidding?? This cd is ONLY for the diehard Finn fan. The singers manage to grunt and sputter their way through Neil and Tim Finn classics so badly that I'm still suffering after having listened to it months ago. Do yourself a favor, and keep the 2nd cd with the songs sung by the Finns, and then take the first one and stomp on it, cut it up into little bits, burn it, bury it, and then pray that it is never heard in this universe again!"
2,Price good but very little protection,"This was my first bubble mailer - offered very little protection for the contents. Very flat bubbles, compared to bubble mailers at Staples store. Probably fine if contents cannot be crushed or damaged, such as a rigid box or VHS tape. I'll be trying a different brand."
5,Very Nice,These are professional looking bubble mailers . It is much cheaper to buy this product in bulk then one at a time . I am very happy with my purchase
1,Cant close the Cover.,"You cant close the item, because gum is not great to close.I have lost 5 to 6 packages due to gum problem, some packages opened while delivery.Label also wont stick to cover, if you past the label, it will come out.You need to put the separate tape to close the cover, that is extra work.Regards"
3,not so white,i was expecting these to be white and they actually a light grey. a little disappointing but how can you get 250 padded envelopes for this price. bargain!
3,A little to small,Bubble mailer it self was fine. The dimensions given for mailer were outside dimensions not inside thus making it a little tight for shipping dvds and video games. Dimensions should reflect inside dimensions!
2,Very poor quality,"Product is of very poor quality. The mailers are very thin, and there is very little cushioning.I would not have bought these if I had seem them in person first, and I will not be buying them again."
4,#0 Poly bubble mailers,These guys have always shipped top of the line mailers. This last batch I recieved were a little different than usual. The plastic strip over the sticky is hard to remove and the mailers are 6x9 and not 6x10. Hopefully they get back to the old ones with the blue lettering and pink sticky strip. The new ones are red letters and clear sticky strip. Still the mailers are excellent.
2,"Too small, too flat. More like #00","Like a couple of other people have mentioned, these are too small to be called #0. We sell DVDs and have purchased tens of thousands of bubble mailers from various manufacturers. A DVD will barely fit in these. When we ship a DVD, we include literature with a rubber band around it. It's like torture getting these in there.And again like another reviewer said, the bubbles are very flat and there just isn't that much protection.The adhesive is another problem. It is not evenly distributed and there are often streaks or even blank areas which has required us to use tape to make sure they stay shut.To sum it up, they're pretty much useless. Better to spend a little more and get a quality mailer that is the correct size, cushioning and adhesive quality."
2,Strange,Good price but the weird non-stick texture is preventing the self adhesive labels from sticking. I have to also tape down the labels but I still feel the labels will come off if given the chance. I would not ship merchandise of value in these.
5,Great value,"Fits a variety of head sizes, very warm, and for the price, you have a winner here. I bought one for each family member to have in case of emergency."
3,"Good quality, but too small","The cap is well made; warm; and, alas, too small for my emphatically normal head. My old Army issue cap was bigger, but I can't buy from AAFES anymore. And these are tough to find. I'm keeping it for snowstorms, but at this small size, stylish it certainly ain't. Too bad."
4,US Navy watch caps,"I find these to be as good as the issue ones from the military, I have worn this type of hat for fall and winter months for years and find them warm and durable and hold their shape well compared to some of the ones on the market"
4,pretty good cap,"-warm-nicely made-just a little stiff when I bought it, but it loosen up for a more comfortable fit- love the colordefinitely get this hat"
1,Sent me the wrong color when I asked for a different color.,I asked for a black color but I got a different color. I am not happy with it. The color is not good.
2,Wool Cap,"This product does not have either the look or the feel of ""100%"" wool. A waste of $$$. I would have been better off to buy one those acrylic caps from a Dollar store."
4,very good hat for the price,this is a very warm hat and easy to take care of it. i recommend it. covers ears well also
3,"Nice cap, but a bit small","My friend wanted a 100% wool watch cap. The cap is very nice and warm, but it seems pretty small for an average male head (it's a one-size-fits-all). My friend decided to keep it anyway, and it seems to be slowly stretching out."
2,Text too small,This is the worst printed text book I have ever seen. The text is too small and the writer cannot explain his lessons in a language a reader can understand.A waste of money and time.
3,Good Mug but Check the Handle,"I purchased this mug for my fiance as a Christmas present. When he opened it, he noticed that some of the paint on the handle looked a bit funny, but we figured it was just a paint defect. Now it's February and the whole handle is falling off - starting right at the mark we saw early on. It appears that the paint covered up a weak spot on the handle and that the glaze was the only thing holding the mug together for the 1.5 months it has been in use. It's really too bad because he LOVES the mug otherwise. The colors are great, the shape is fun, and it fits his hands perfectly.If you opt for this mug, I highly recommend looking it over on receipt and exchanging it if there's anything strange-looking."
5,Sargent's Watercolors,"This impressive collection of Sargent's watercolors provides high quality color reproductions that allow me to study the works closely and gain a sense of the artist's achievement in this medium. The introduction sets the works in context, and the arrangement according to themes and genres conveys the range and originality of Sargent's artistic vision."
4,lovely to look at,"This book has fairly good reproductions of Sargent's watercolors. What I enjoy most is seeing many of his watercolors for the first time. My only complaint is that the book's smaller size limits how big the reproductions can be. Otherwise, this is a fantastic book."
5,An all-time Favorite,"I turn to this book time and again and am always astounded at the paintings. In his watercolor work, Sargent was a ""Painter's Painter"" - an artist who worked with paint so playfully, with color so passionatly, with caligraphic brushwork so seemingly irreverent - that the final effect is breathtaking and as fresh as the moment it was painted."
3,book great but photos (of ART) not great,"My watercolor teacher used this book in class and I was so fascinated with the artist, John Singer Sargent, that I bought a copy for myself. However I noticed that many of the color photos of his works were darker in value than the ones in her book. I took mine to class and we compared the two books. It seems they are identical except my copy has darker value on many prints and they were from different printings. Anyway, the color is a bit disappointing. But I am glad I bought the book anyway. I love this artist. His watercolors were so innovative. As my teacher pointed out, he was an impressionistic master that went unnoticed at the time. He is noted for his portraiture, which is how he earned his substantial living. But his watercolor was his best work."
5,Exciting,"I must say I know nothing of telescopes so when I went on looking to purchase one as a gift for my boyfriend (he's a big fan of space exploration), I searched through several before landing on this one. The telescope arrived in great timing and was packaged VERY well and safe for its travel. Nothing was missing and/or broken. My boyfriend is a bit tech savvy so it only took about 25-30minutes for him to put together and we looked through it that same night. You get really clean, crisp images and I also purchased the moon filter which I'm glad I did because the moon was especially bright that night. The telescope is beautiful in person and is wonderful for just starting out. Thanks!"
5,An excellent EQ telescope!!,"Orion makes quality optics for reasonable prices. It came well packaged and rather quickly. I appreciate ""KDKNS""'s review; it's got a lot of good tips. The rather negative review that compares a Dobsonian to this telescope isn't a fair one. Like was said elsewhere, they are really in two different camps. For an equatorial mount 130mm reflector, this one is hard to beat. The tripod is quite sturdy. First thing I did after assembly was to look at the moon. My first word was ""WOW!"" Great crisp image. I also purchased the 13% moon filter, a 2X Barlow, and an additional 6.3mm plossl eyepiece. The last item brings the magnification up to about 206X. (260x is the highest useable magnification, 16x being the lowest.) All in all, I'm very pleased with this telescope. Thanks Orion! Keep upp the good work! :)"
4,Good buy,The telescope arrived in excellent condition and assembly was not difficult. However the instructions for balancing the scope and for use would be easier to follow if a video demonstrating the process was provided.
5,Great Quality Bathouse,"this is a top quality, well built, sturdy bathouse and we're glad we ordered 2 from Looker which we plan to put up in the Spring. This is our first attempt knowing they are now in ""hybernation"" in our part of the country, so we can't yet comment on how well they attract bats but compared to several other products we saw locally before buying on line from Looker, these are far superior in construction. If I were a bat, I can't imagine an nicer abode."
5,Songs with Positive Messages,"I was pleasantly suprized when I first listened to this cd. I was expecting foul mouthed, undiscernable ""singing"" a la all those other R&B and hip hop artists. Cincere is obviously an over-comer who wants to get his positive message out through honest, heart-felt lyrics and beautifully arranged tracks. His message is: life is tough, but you can get through the hard times if you keep making the right choices and the bleak situation you may be going through will change; you're not alone. I listen to this cd in my car continuously because it is so uplifting. Thanks, Cincere, I want more!!!!"
3,okay but too dated,had this album in the day and the vocal achievements are still amazing but the songs are not exceptional. Bye now
5,One of Barbra's best,"This is a GREAT Christmas album. Barbra was in superb voice, although, she recorded it over a weekend break while filming FUNNY GIRL and the story has always been that she had a cold and didn't feel like she should record...but she did because the time was all booked, the musicians were all rehearsed and it was ready, get set, go.The result is a lovely, burnished quality to her voice that only adds to the whole charm here.It's better than her later holiday album for the same reasons that most of her earlier work is better than contemporary things like THE MOVIE ALBUM. Her arrangements back then were more thrilling and her voice was simply a younger, more vibrant instrument. She's still a great singer...but she's past the days (and rightfully so) where she could send chills up your spine and hit one out of the ballpark each time.But, she did just that in 1967 and thankfully, we have the recordings to prove it!"
1,Hilarious,She doesn't even believe in Christianity and she's singing about the birth of the Son of God.Talking about trying to make a dime....Wow!
1,Karen Carpenter is far better,The superb Karen Carpenter had the voice and the soul. Barbra is SO boring and her diction is ridiculous. ¡Santaaaaa Marrrrria!
4,Simply wonderful,"I purchased this cd last Christmas and really had only done so because I have always loved Barbra's version of ""The Lord's Prayer"". I was pleasantly rewarded with other wonderful works. I especially love ""The Best Gift."" I don't know if this is specifically a Christmas song, but any mother will instantly respond to it. I only give the album 4 stars because although her version of ""Jingle Bells"" is fun, it just doesn't seem to belong with the other more traditional and classic songs on the cd. Really, this is a minor quibble. This is a Christmas album you will play throughout each and every Christmas season."
1,"Broken Primer Pump in Less Than 1 Year, Eheim Has Horrible Customer Service","I bought this filter based on many reviews saying that if you can afford it, Eheim is the best and the quietest. Well, I shelled out the big bucks and got the Professional 3. Well, it is pretty quiet and that's probably why I have this first complaint about this filter. First, I was disappointed in the flow rate. Second, the primer does not easily start up the filter. Finally, I've had it for less than a year, and after cleaning it and restarting it by using the primer pump, the primer pump broke this week. I can't believe how cheaply made it was. The pump is made of plastic. I contacted the company which says ""3 Year Guarantee"" on their website. It's been two weeks and I've contacted them twice and I have not heard a single peep from them. I will never buy Eheim again. I'm going with Fluval next."
1,Very Disappointing,"EHEIM Professional 3e 2078 External Electronic Canister Filter for up to 185 US GallonsI will make this as short as possible...........don't purchase this product, very disappointing quality and functionality.Flow rate is miserable........using this on a 150G tank as it states it's good for up to 185G tank. Well I tell you the flow rate is so miserable I wouldn't use it on a 55G tank. This is with brand new pads and media......I can't imagine after things get a little dirty and restrict the flow some.My fish would never survive with this filter.Also, the filter trays and components are very cheaply made.....not up to the published standards of Eheim.I returned this filter within 2 days of purchase.If your looking for a canister filter for a larger tank look at the Marineland C-530........much less expensive and is a lot more durable with quality parts and has a great flow rate.Stay away from the Eheim 3e 2078 ""Electronic"" canister filter!"
1,Brand new unit LEAKED!,"The title says it all. I had just sent back a brand new Eheim 2076 for leaking after 10 minutes of operation! I figured it was a fluke and was excited to get the new unit, but that excitement quickly turned to absoloute disgust. I sent the product back to the dealer.I decided on a Fluval FX5 and have been very happy with that purchase.As an aside, I was able to use the Eheim mechanical and biological material in the Fluval FX5 and the Eheim material is performing its duties well (keeping the tank healthy)."
5,Definitely a good buy!!!,"This book fully met my expectations. It is very informative and provides detailed descriptions of techniques, accompanied by lots of pictures. The content is well thought out, well structured and includes a lot of of valuable, practical comments and tips provided by the author. On each page one can find a Chinese proverb or saying that also brings some ""exotic"" philosophy and taste to this western publication. Well done!"
1,A Collection of Basic Techniques that is Poorly Performed and Photographed.,"I bought both volumes of ""The Wing Chun Compendium""; as the title indicates, it is a compendium of a bunch of basic moves. This product, like many others on the market, is merely a laundry list of techniques/forms. If you know nothing at all, and I mean NOTHING, then it might do you some good, but probably more confusion. The photos are in black and white with dark gray background making them camouflaging into the background. If you are a beginner, it might be of no use. However, if you are a serious WC practitioner, then don't even waste your money. These volumes are huge, but they are mostly empty. I bought these books for reference, but it is not the standard I was looking for."
2,Nice Photos,"Being a student for 13 yrs, it was good to find a book that covered so many topics of wing chun and his approach to it all. While I may not agree with a lot the author had to write, too much outdated info, he stayed faithful to the minimal of the art...namely a good description of the forms. The photos and explanations may help someone who forgot how to do the forms. Otherwise not much else if you never practiced wing chun."
4,Excellent value. Probably the best speakers I've owned.,"So I picked these up to replace the stock speakers in my G8 GT. How could I have such a powerful aggressive looking car with such a terrible audio system? I relpaced all four door speaker with these and let me tell you I could not be happier. I've replaced the speakers on the last three cars I've owned and thse are hands down the sweetest sounding. Excellent highs and mids, and solid bass. Teamed with the two 8 in subs in the rear deck that I replaced I have the cleanest sounding sound system I have ever owned in a car...Now I know there are higher ""better"" speakers on the market, but if you are looking to run speakers off a stock reciever, these are a great choice considering they run at 2.6 ohms. Perfect for those who don't want to utilize an amp. Good Luck..."
1,Much worse bass response than Saab factory door speakers,"Installed these in the doors of my 2005 Saab 9-3. For this model Saab, the factory crossover only sends bass to the doors. The Infinities handled most bass guitar ok but any kind of bass drum caused them to distort and pop. I removed them and re-installed the factory Pioneer speakers."
4,good sound on a budget,Accurate mids and crisp highs these will easily get loud enough to listen until your tympanic membranes can't take it. i love em
5,Excellent Affordable Factory upgrade,"I bought one pair here on Amazon and found another set locally for $40. What a great sound when paired with a sub. Awesome, crisp highs!"
4,Pleased with Infinity,My OEM front speakers in my 2004 Colorado were blown (one anyway). I priced the OEM speakers at about $40 / set. For $10 more I was able to get these Infinitys. These seem to have a deeper base than the OEMs as well as improved treble. I have to say also that I can get more volume from these than I did the OEMs. Mounting was a bit difficult. Took about 1-1/2 hours to change them over. Down side was wiring. Would have been nice if they offered a wiring adapter kit to hook to the existing wiring. The speakers came with a mounting adapter kit that was cumbersome to install. I scrapped the whole kit and screwed them right to the opening in the door. I am pleased with the sound for the price. Enough so that I am thinking about replacing the rear seat speakers as well.
4,Great speakers for the price,"Plenty of mounting options. These sound crisp and clean. Good response on the mids. The his are clear. The innovative +3db button and directional tweeter are very useful for getting the right amount of hi where you want it. I don't get much bass from these (even considering they are 6.5""), but what bass response I do get is pretty tight. Others reviewers report decent bass, so it may be that I'm not pushing only 22 RMS each @ 4 ohms. Doesn't bother me though, as I've got a subwoofer for all my bass needs. I've already recommended them to a couple friends."
4,good spoons,"When I received the spoons I thought the quality was good and the weight decent, I haven't had a chance to really use them of yet, but I would recommend them for people that do a lot of cooking because the inset measurements will wear well and the accompanying ring allows for easy sorting of the measurements."
3,never seen the price below $11.95,"I ordered these on the excellent quality of the measuring cups. Unfortunately, they are pretty pricey even with the gold box discount. I wish there was such a thing as a 1/3 teaspoon measure."
5,Hefty and well finished....,"Not that it matters, but MIU France was founded in Hong Kong in 1978 and moved to mainland China 18 years later. These are heavy-weight stainless and have a nice oval shape for getting into smaller spice jars without creating waste. These complement the 7-piece MIU France measuring cup set. A must for the serious baker."
4,Beautiful Measuring Spoon Set,"These are very well made, and I love the long handles and the oval bowls. My only complaint is that they are not labeled with metric measurements, which I occasionally use. But otherwise, a wonderful set! Would buy this again."
1,if you care about country-of-origin...,"My rating does NOT reflect the quality of the product: In searching for stainless measuring spoons made in the U.S.A., MIU's spoons cropped up. The description actually said MIU France. Since I never did find any of the spoons that were made in the U.S.A., (but for some really expensive pewter ones) I ordered these. When they arrived, I was unhappy to see that they were, in fact, Made in China. They did look sturdy, but we are trying to support, first, the U.S. manufacturing sector, second, another country's that is not covering the earth with slave-wage-made goods and destroying the environment.So, I returned the spoons and cups for that reason.Oh, and the stainless measuring cups (which did appear to be heavy-duty) that I'd ordered from the same company at the same time, were returned for the same reason.Bottom line: If you care about such things, MIU France is a misleading designation."
5,Really excellent product,"I bought mine back in November of 2008 and they still look brand new!The handles are long so it is easy to stick down into a bag or box to scoop and measure ingredients. Unlike cheap plastic versions, the steel won't flex so measuring brown sugar is a snap.Stainless steel means that if you measure a solid shortening or an oil you can clean the spoon easily buy running super hot water over it for a few seconds till oil/grease melts off then clean as normal.I have always hand washed mine so I don't know how they'd hold up to a dish-washing machine.The price may seem high but if you use measuring spoons often and you recognized and enjoy the benefits of fine tools to work with then this is money well spent I think. On the other hand, if you think the knock off stuff at the various dollar stores are 'just as good' as quality merchandise that costs more then you will only be reading this to make fun of the rest of us :pHighly recommended."
5,The best.,"A bit pricey for what they are, but I expect these to be the last measuring spoons I ever buy. Clearly marked, and I like the shape, as they fit in jars much better than more circular designs. Good weight to them, nice feel to the handles. What more do you want? THEY'RE SPOONS!"
4,Nice spoons,"These spoons have held up well. However, the ring started to get some rust spots (I do put these in the dishwasher), so I took it off. The spoons are very deep so it is easy to get into some narrow containers (as opposed to wider spoons), but then it can be difficult to get everything out of the recesses of the spoon.Good spoons, and I definitely don't regret the purchase."
2,Falls well short of the original,I love American Pimp and was hoping for some amazing bonus footage with this DVD but aside from a few moments it is very obvious why this material didn't make the cut the first time around. Probably worth a rental if you're a huge AP fan but not to own. If you have DVD money burning a whole in your pocket just buy another copy of American Pimp and give it to a friend or loved-one. (The soundtrack is pretty good though.)
4,Advanced concepts,"Highly recommended, can't say much more. It's really well explained and doesn't leave you floundering under a dense mass of information, eventhough it gets into some advanced concepts. Riley always keeps your mind on the important issues about being a good musician and makes you never lose sight of the point of the excercises."
2,Poor sound quality,I bought this item early in '07. I rarely use it because people on the other end if the line always have difficulty hearing me. I've tried moving it around in my car with no success - even just holding it in my hand. A waste of money for me.
4,Motorola T305 Bluetooth Hands-Free works well,"I like the T305 Hands-Free. It works well. I have it on the dash in front of the steering wheel, which I thought would be best to not interfere with the radio. I get clear speaker sound and the listeners say they hear me well. Good, inexpensive solution.There are a couple of minor negatives. The button to turn it on is small and flush with the case making it difficult to turn on. The indicator LED's are difficult to see in this position. The charge cord is a curled type, a straight one would make it easier to use, routing it to the 12v outlet."
4,great for hands free,"I don't like the look of an ear piece and had heard good things about the Motorola T305 from my daughter who has one. This came within 5 days of ordering, was very easy to set up, has a short charge time, is small and unobtrusive and is priced much lower than I saw it a brick 'n morter stores. I don't have any problem at all with the ""annoying"" blue light some reviewers mentioned, don't even notice it. The only drawback I've experienced is that clarity seems to be compromised a little at high speeds, otherwise everyone I've talked to says it's just as tho I'm talking directly into my cell phone. I highly recommend this product!"
4,Be hands free in CA and happy,"Got it just in time for the new law in CA. It paired up no problem with Samsung U540. Using it to access the phone's voice-activated dialing system is great - a bonus I didn't expect to get. There is no need to touch the phone at all to make calls from your phone book or to call the number of your choice. Callers on the other end tell me it sounds like any other phone call, and I hear them fine. It is smaller than you might think, and it is plenty loud. This has got to be better than driving around with one of those ear hooks on."
4,Easy and Loud,"I've had the for a few weeks and haven't been able to play with all the options yet. It paired flawlessly with my Samsung A717 and is very loud compared to others. I've used it for 10 days without charging, which really pleases me. For the price, I think it's well worth it."
1,Sounded Aweful,Poor sound quality and could not even use it after trying several different times with different phones. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
2,callers cannot hear,"Tried this speaker for a few weeks in my car but my wife and others complained they could not hear me over the background noise. I tried eliminating or reducing the noise in my car (radio, A/C fan, ect) but nothing seemed to work even if the speaker was attached to the drivers' visor."
2,It is so so...,"If I am driving around town it works pretty well, but if I am on the freeway I can not understand what the caller is saying. I have been told that the caller can not hear what I am saying either. I am going to try out one that actually come through my car speakers as I have read and been told by a friend that has one that they work pretty well."
2,Time limit to talk?,"I second the comment about the annoying blue light right over your line of sight. But I have a issue with both of the units I bought (one for each car so I wouldn't have to remember to move it!). I'll be talking, using the device and after 5 minutes or so (haven't timed it but both units do this and they are fully charged) and the unit just drops without ANY warning (the call stays up becuase I can hit the button on my phone to use it rather than the device). Pretty well makes the device useless for me as I make calls related to my work and often times they are NOT short 1-2 minute calls due to technical nature of job."
5,Great speaker phone,This a great speaker phone. I was looking for a hands free device that I would not need to use a ear piece. I have no trouble hearing my calls and my phone automatically picks it up when I turn it on.
2,NOT HAPPY,"We got our T305 Bluetooth and hooked it up to an LG phone. On my end I heard everything perfectly clear but any person I would call said that they couldn't hear me because there was alot of static and interference. I turned off the bluetooth and talked on the phone by itself and everything was perfectly clear on both ends. We switch it to another phone to see if maybe it wasn't compatible with the LG and got the same problem. We also thought that maybe there was alot of interference on our part of town so I tried it from work (65 miles from home) and still had the same problem. It reminded me alot of the $7 Jupiter Jack that you see on TV. When you switch it to the designated radio stations, the voice on the other end of the line was barely audible because of all the static and interference. I would not recommend this product."
2,Buzzes,"In many ways a good design, but it picks up the vibration of the car through the visor and transmits it as an annoying buzz to the party on the receiving end of the line."
1,Subpar product,I am using this product in my car and it does not perform well. The people that I am talking to can't hear me well and I don't hear them well. I do not recommend this product.
4,Motorola Bluetooth Hands-Free Speaker T305,"I was given this as a gift then bought one for my husband. We've both been very happy with them. Setting them up is a breeze and they hold a charge really well. I love being able to use the phone in the car without an earpiece, etc. The price is nice too. I would recommend it!"
1,Not Worth It,Product used in the car makes it sound like you are in the other end of a warehouse talking thru a speaker phone. Not a usable product. Do not waste your money.
5,Motorola Speakerphone,"My first experience with a speakerphone of this type was the Japra. It is huge and cumbersome. It was difficult to avoid the swing-out mike when I moved my head durong normal driving conditions. I finally sent it back after seeing an ad for the Motorola. The T305 is small and sleek. It's actually smaller than my garage door opener and fits easily on my visor. Performance is excellent on both ends. A nice feature of the T305 is that it automatically switches itself off after losing contact with the phone for more than 30 minutes. No more forgetting to turn off the unit, but it's still on and ready to go when you return to your car after a brief shopping trip or errend run."
4,Motorola Hands-Free Speaker Mostly Perfect,"I bought this several weeks ago due to our State implementing a hands-free law :) .It was extremely easy to set up.It works really well, I'm very happy with it.The only reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is inconsistent in voice tag dialing. I created voice tags for every number in my phone contacts list but the unit does not manage to make a connection using the voice tag feature very well. ""Home"" connects fairly reliably but trying to say ""Mom Cell"" or ""Samantha Home"" or ""Meredith Work"" only works about 30% of the time.I can scroll to the person I want to call on my phone and push ""talk"" to dial -- not that big of a deal, but technically violates the hands free concept.It's likely that a) my car makes too much road noise and interferes, b) I recorded the voice tags too close to the mic and need to re-record while actually sitting in my car with road noise (?)."
5,Works Perfect!,"Took all of 5 minutes to install - and that included the time it took to open the box. I use in a H3 truck, which tends to be noisy but the people I talked to say they can not tell a difference. I use with the Motorola Q so this uses the same charger as my phone - very nice.. I used to use a headset - but this is so much better when you are driving.."
3,Like it yet it has problems,Depending on car noise inside it works okay. Voice reconigtion isn't very good. It calls people I don't want for the most part so I have to manually do that. But mostly it work okay. I can hear others very well! They can hear me yet sometimes can't understand. Thought I'd use it a lot yet looking for an ear piece now. Hopefully it's better. Does work great with the razor phone.
4,"Sounds good, works nice","Works well and I'm able to comply with NYS Hands-Free laws. Folks on the other end seem to be pleased with the clarity, too. As far as the charger only being available for the cigarette lighter, I found my Motorola Bluetooth earpiece AC charger works on the hands-free speaker, good thing I kept the AC charger because fortunately for me I lost the annoying little Bluetooth earpiece."
2,Voice Command Pretty Much Not Usable,"I've had mine for three weeks, and I'm taking it back. My issue is that ""the voice"" and I can't communicate. She can't understand me, and I can't understand her. I'm fine using it to answer incoming calls. Placing an outgoing call using a voice command is impossible. I say ""Call Rose."" Not only does she answer with ""Did you say Brown?"" she says it in a way I can barely make out. We finally matched on ""Margaret,"" but the way she pronounced Margaret was almost unrecognizable. I entertained my car pool group trying to make an outgoing call. People were laughing so hard they were crying."
3,Pretty good for the price.,"This is a really good bluetooth speaker for the price. The only thing you have to be careful about is the speaker volume. It's a little hard to hear it on the other end or just speak VERY loudly. Other than that, it's pretty good and SUPER easy to install and set up."
2,Another thing for my junk pile!,"Perfect idea, not perfect performance. Sound quality is very poor. Really was hopefull given all the great reviews."
2,Bad features,"If you leave your car and don't have the system off, it will answer your call if you are close. On/off button is not user friendly when attached to you visor. Switch broke internally. $70 bucks shot to hell"
1,can't hear you clearly,This product was recommended to me. Unfortunately the receiving person could not understand or hear clearly. I even held the unit close to my mouth. This happened for all callers. A plus was that I could hear them clearly. I would pass on this one.
3,Motorola Bluetooth Speaker,It's okay....does what I need it to do. People say it sounds tinny when they are talking to me but I can hear everyone else clearly.
3,"Good product. Unfortunately, my car is very loud so it does not work as well in it.","This is a good product and the delivery was flawless and timely. I enjoy the long battery life. Unfortunately, my car is loud and it does not work as well as my ear devices. Under more quiet circumstances it may work better."
4,Makes life easier...............,This is a realy good product. I have a bluetooth earpiece and I like this one a lot better. Some reviews have listed that the light is hard to see. I don't really feel this is a problem because your phone will tell if it is linked with the bluetooth. I do like that it has a designated power button and does not use the call button as a power button. Product sounds good. So far so good. Hope this helps.
4,Worth the investment,"I had to get a handsfree device to use my cellphone in the car. I don't like those things you stick in your ear. I saw my sister had this device, and I gave it a try. The broadcast is clear. People can hear me, and I can hear them. I don't have to take my phone out of my pocket to operate it. I just turn the T305 on when i get in the car, and I turn it off when I leave. There's going to be an issue when i leave it on, and I'm within it's range--then I can't answer my phone. When I go out of range, the T305 automatically turns off."
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this car speaker because of the positive reviews, however after about 5 months of working really well it stopped working. Don't know what happened."
1,Sorry it sucks,Typing this on my iPhone so I'll make it short. When my wife uses this product she sounds like she's in a tunnel. The on light is annoying and distracting at night. The power button is the size of a grain of rice. Good idea...bad production!!
1,Not useable,Folks I'm talking to say they can't hear or understand me. Very difficult to turn off and on. Not a good product.
4,Better than expected,"Bought 3 of these for each vehicle, did not want to buy on-star phone service.... they pair easily and sound quite good........ volume can be a little tricky to adjust ""just right""Would recommend.."
5,Love It!,I hate having anything in my ear. I did a lot of research before I bought this. It is super! Easy to set up. Easy to use. The sound quality is awesome. The person on the other end comes through loud and clear. I was disappointed there wasn't a home charger but luckily my husband has another bluetooth device that uses the same charger so I am all set. Would highly recommed this product.
1,Motorola T305,"Bright, constantly flashing blue light was obnoxious. Can't see having this in the car, especially at night. What were they thinking?"
1,Died in a month.,"Pros: Before it stopped working, and when it worked correctly, it was acceptable. I could hear who I was talking to and they could here me. The device recognized the voice tags for my phone numbers about 90% of the time.Cons: After about a month of use, the device would no longer turn on, even after being charged overnight. It would not turn on even when attached to a power source, even though the blue indicator light was lit to show it was fully charged. This appeared to be a useful item for hands-free use without wearing an ear piece, but it is a poorly made product.Other Thoughts: About a week before the item died, I had a horrible time using it. Whenever it or the phone was turned on, the speaker would just keep beeping, and I could not stop it. After I deleted the bluetooth connection on my phone, and re-established it, it worked again for a day or two."
1,Piece of Crap,"A one star rating for this piece of junk is a step up! Nobody could understand me when I talked; even the automated traffic robot! It was excellent, however, for throwing out the window at high speed."
3,"OK, but better choices","Purchased for wife to use in car. Does the job, but needs to be turned on each time she gets in the car. Also did not include a 120v charger (did include car charger), which had to be purchased separately. Better choice is Motorola T325, same price (Amazon). It activates when the paired cell is near, will charge from Motorola cell (Entice) 120 v charger as well as included car charger."
4,Motorola T305,"Good speaker, good loud ring,good microphone, I charge the batteries just two times in a week"
2,"OK, not great","For 25 bucks I wont send this back but to use it successfully I have to keep in my hand up close to my mouth when speaking. Listeners complain that they cant understand me and ask me where I am when I try to use it clipped to my visor.I have to constantly monitor the volume as well, too loud on some calls and too low on others.Its better than holding my phone up to my ear but didnt exactly eliminate the use of my hand, which is what I wanted to accomplish."
4,Good product for the price,Good bang for the buck. Installs easily connects to your phone in seconds. I have to talk louder than something that maybe in your ear but otherwise works well.
2,Not so Good...,"California is going hands-free in July and I needed a way to talk while driving for my work. I don't really like wearing things in my ears so thought this visor-speaker would be great. Bought it based on the decent reviews here. The instructions were clear and it paired easily. I could hear people fine and was pleased with the sound quality on my end. However, people on the other end said I sounded awful...in a tunnel. So it is on its way back to Amazon. I got a Plantronics headset at the Verizon store instead. Its actually pretty comfortable and the sound quality is great."
