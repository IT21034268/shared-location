1,Great collection - horrible quality,"As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here."
5,Prompt and Utter Distruction,"My opinion about this book is it joins a long list of similar books that pick out parts of the decisions that were made in 1945 about use of the atomic bomb and criticize U.S. leaders who made decisions under the press of time and circumstance and in dealing with a Japanese military, which totally ran the country. In such a situation, someone like the author of this book (and there are many others like him) can go back and question the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan from the safe distance of more than 50 years. In my review of the handling of the atomic bomb in August, 1945, with very minor exceptions, the leaders of the United States made the correct decision based on all the facts.uwcharlie"
5,Great History Book,I bought this book for school.. I have not read it yet but it arrived in perfect condition.. Very fast shipping.
4,Hot Funk Coming Through,"The undisputed master of funk served this up in 1982, and it has stored well. Including the classic, often-sampled ""Atomic Dog"" and other summer-lovin' tracks, ""Computer Games"" paved the way for the high-tech funk/hip-hop fusion we have today. There's dance tracks, chill tracks, and evrything in between. Don't miss this classic."
3,"Good, but...","Compared to a lot of other George Clinton endeavors (Maggot Brain by Funkadelic, Mothership Connection by Parliament), Computer Games is reasonably mediocre. There are some pretty good cuts, and of course, the hit song Atomic Dog, but it lacks any connecting element or storyline. You may groove a little in your chair listening to this cd, but it's nothing to get up and funk about."
3,Emma Isn't Pretty Enough,"I bought this version of ""Emma"" for my wife because she was smitten by anything Jane Austen. (And I had read that it was 'the closest' version to the book.) So, I ordered it. But, alas, it was an untimely purchase because the newest ""Emma"" happened to appear on television. When I proudly presented 'my' gift version of ""Emma"" to My Beloved, she could not reconcile a ""plain Emma"" with the more attractive and vivacious newer model of the latest TV offering. (For my sake she toiled through it and then went out and bought the latest TV version.)Sometimes life is cruel. Perhaps the real Emma was as plain-faced as the one I purchased, but I could never convince my wife of that.That is why I have scored this ""Emma"" as 3 stars [""It's OK""]. The movie probably deserves a better score for the acting and storyline integrity, but I have discovered that I am as shallow as my wife."
2,Boring - Not a Good Version,"I have seen several versions of Emma and enjoyed them. However, this one is my least favorite. The actress who plays Emma rather grated on my nerves and I did not enjoy her performance at all. I would not recommend this one."
3,It's not great.,"It's just ok. I didn't really enjoy many of the actors, the sets & scenery aren't great and I felt like it strayed from the book in a few unneccesary ways.It's worth having for a collector of Jane Austin movies, but there are at least three much better versions out there."
4,Worthwhile and Enjoyable Viewing,"I chose this version of ""Emma"" because it was free with Amazon Prime. ""Emma"" and ""Mr. Knightly"" especially are likeable characters. What comes across poignantly is the economic/social need of early nineteenth-century women to marry in order to survive and to avoid spinsterhood and governess positions. The eponynous Emma is convincingly severe throughout the series. I recommend this production as being a good rendering of the original novel, the outlook of the people at the time, and also an interesting taste of 1970's acting and styles."
3,Poor casting ruins a decent screenplay,"This Emma follows the book faithfully, which means that there is plenty that could be cut. The main problem is the lead actors. They are much too old to be 21 year old Emma and 36 year old Mr. Knightley. If you want to see an Emma that is light and funny and sweet, like the spirit of the novel, get the 1996 A&E/BBC production starring Kate Beckinsale."
3,"faithful, but not as enjoyable","I have watched, I believe, all other Emmas available. This is the one I enjoyed the least. Emma didn't seem lovable, though I felt like I could relate to her better as I was starting to recognize her subtle facial expressions later on in the movie. I thought Mr. Woodhouse was an interesting character in this movie, and I liked Mr. Elton. This movie didn't make Mr. Elton seem like such a bad guy, which in all probability seems realistic. I also thought Mrs. Bates was pretty good.And just for the record, though I'm not an expert, there were definitely changes in dialogue and details in this movie."
3,Emma,"This is a ""chick flick"". I have watched it a least a dozen times. I do like the newer version better but this fills an evening very well for me. I enjoy the period pieces and am constantly amazed that this piece still claims facination after 200 years. I am a fan of Jane Austen and I have several versions of each of her works. I have read the books as well."
1,Bleh!,"Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."
1,Not as easy to use as stated,Took hours to remove old finish from oak table and now the piece looks cloudy and dull. I am very disappointed and will need to use something to bring the table to life again!
2,thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high,"I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high.... this was just a waste of my time and money, now I will have to drive to town and get these items so I can get the project done in time!"
3,Too much human drama,"Sure it's the typical genetic mutations on the loose horror novel, but the creatures themselves are actually pretty inventive and are so far the first in a book that made me feel a little ookie when picturing them, so in that department it's a step above most. However, compared to the rest of the story the amount of monster action is lacking. Most of the book centers on the main characters trying to decide if they are truly in love or not. Easily 50 - 100 pages could have been dropped to make this a tighter more compact and enjoyable read, but instead it tends to drag and shift its focus on the disinteresting thoughts of the main characters far too much. Character developement is fine, but in this case instead of developement things are stuck on repeat. Overall, yes, I liked the book, but more editing should have been done."
1,No ADA seal of approval,I have this toothpaste and the ADA seal of approval is nowhere to be found on the tube. It doesn't whiten either.
2,lame photos and dreary topic,"This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
3,Good concept,Girl Culture's concept of women is interesting. The photos show how women see themselves. Some really great and revealing photos.
2,"Not bad, but not worth it","While the photographs of Lauren Greenfield were beautiful, I found the subjects she chose to be predictable and a poor representation of girlhood for most of American girls. Come on...fat camp? anorexics? models? a few spring break photos for good measure? Greenfield's book would've been groundbreaking in the early 90's, but her subjects have been done-over and over again.It appears that Greenfield herself was looking for something profound in her subjects. The results feel labored, and almost eager, as though the photos have an invisable caption attached. There is neither spontaniety, nor profundity in the way she frames her subject.There are a few photos which I did like. For example, the photographs of a young girl's quinceanera (a ""sweet "" fifteen) are lovely and refreshing. I also enjoyed the accompanying text, in which the girls talk about their life."
3,mildly interesting,"This book is ok, I would consider it as a gift to a woman under 30. As a male reader, I found the book a bit boring as a photojournal, but the stories were mildly interesting. Not an addition to a personal library, a read and donate in my opinion."
3,The Good and the Bad,"I am one of the girls in this book. I was 16 when Lauren photographed me. There is only one photograph of me and there is no story to go along with it. Why? Because I was a teen with a buzz cut who worked for a youth organization as a peer counselor. This does not fit the theme of her book, only the idea that I was controlled by our consumer culture worked to serve her concept so the rest of me was omitted. But hey, I like clothes so I must be a mindless drone of the beast that is consumer culture. I own the book now and I think what she is doing is admirable. Unfortunately I think she only shows one side and I am curious about the rest of the girls who were portrayed so negatively. This book makes a point that needs to be heard. It warns us of the dangers of our own materialism and the portrayal of women in the media. But I am sad that Lauren has not shown the other side, but simply blots it out to make sure she proves her point."
1,I found this product for $7.99 today...,"I found this exact same product for $7.99 today at Walgreens. This is a sale price, however, even regular price is less than this. I feel some/many of the mega diaper packs on amazon are a good deal, but not this one."
1,"Holds #1, not #2","The title says it all. I never had a trouble with #1 leaking, but almost everytime my breastfed son has a BM (which are usually somewhat loose), it leaks out the back or leg area. Perhaps it happens because the waistband isn't stretchy. I'm not going to buy these diapers again."
5,Assessing NAFTA,"This book contains a comprehensive assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Authors from all three countries probe different aspects of the deal; they provide an overall assessment as well as detaailed examination of some of the critical issues and sectors that will be affected.In addition to assessments of NAFTA from Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the book examines specific issues, namely, the enviroment, agriculture, investment provisions, rules of origin, the trade in automotive goods, dispute settlement, energy, the textile and apparel sector, and the financial sector. -- from book's back cover"
2,Lack of Sensitivity,"Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so."
5,Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family,"If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
4,I can't believe it's not butter!,"It's hard to believe that, in its prime, this was considered maybe the greatest picture ever made. It wasn't and it isn't. And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives ""the performance of a lifetime"", which in his case, after seeing ""Superman"", is probably true. Maria Schneider is so, so; Jean Pierre Laúd is execrable and Mássimo Girotti all but steals the show as Brando's funny-you-should-ask rival. All in all, much ado about... butter!"
2,Overrated,"Marlon Brando is a marvelous actor, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in ""9 1/2 Weeks"". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be ""OH! MY EYES!!""A film without a writer is a recipe for disaster, and it really shows here. Skip this. You're not missing a thing."
4,I;m required,"you""re fired, your fired I I Og wer adgf faerb asdb[okn dswlelkb dlf twd. I oo peradts sdg sodmr. Bye."
3,Buy it for Brando,"The film is uneven, with every scene not involving Brando taking an immediate plunge in energy and interest. Fortunately, there is a lot of Brando, and Brando at his absolute best: broken, brooding, continuously near tears or violence, and wracked with obscene despair. One moment in particular, in which he toys, bored, with an old harmonica, then suddenly breaks down weeping like a little boy, leaves you utterly moved and empty. Three stars for the film overall, five for Marlon Brando's wonderful, gutsy performance."
5,The genius of Marlon Brando,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time about a billion yrs ago and thinking, `So THIS is what being a superb actor is all about.' Brando, playing an expat in Paris who is in despair over his wife's very recent suicide, never once seems to be acting, never seems aware of camera or audience, never seems to consider how others will view him or his role or this movie. Unbelievable.The film was shocking when it was first made in 1973, especially for the graphic and (at that time) `unusual' sexual scenes - and it still makes viewers squirm a bit, but his odd and almost voiceless relationship with Maria Schneider is not self-serving on either end. It's dispassionate and anonymous sex, meant as a Band-Aid on a wound too painful to be dealt with in any other way.Super, super, super."
1,Don't buy it!,"I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff. The acting and storyline is horrible. In the nudity shots she looks like she is wearing a black bear skin rug on her private parts. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,"Horrible, wretched, totally overrated","Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this. It's stupid, sexist, pretentious, the dialogue is wretched, you don't CARE about any of the characters... and a lot of other things that other reviewers have already said."
2,Stupid movie,"When this movie first came out, it was the talk of the town, mainly because of the nudity, I believe. The plot was silly and Brando's acting was awful."
4,Interesting,"I wanted for a long time to see this movie and I wasn't dissapointed. Interesting subject, great cinema."
4,Never cared much for subtitles.,"The movie is good, as I thought it would be, but the entire movie is in French, so be prepared to read subtitles. It took me several tries to watch it all the way through. My fault; I should have known."
1,Last Tango In Paris,"I though the film was terrible. Brando mumbled in French and the plot was unrealistic. I purchased the film to see how sexualism has changed over the years, since this was touted to be the first of expicit sexual scenes."
2,They Say Its Rated NC 17...WHY,There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
1,"BS Detector Hits ""11""","Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the last 15+years or so. I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
5,"to paraphrase Inigo Montoyo and Freud, sometimes a camel hair coat ""[doesn't mean] what you think it means""","Ohmijesus, arriviste in Paris lets go of one branch to grab onto what she thinks is an established man of importance. Brando who raped faerie queen Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire has his bereaved, many-varied way with badly cloaked Toxic Ambition. This is why men break up over the telephone or via email or better yet just VANISH. This is a precursor to Fatal Attraction. I think this movie is supposed to be annoying, off-putting and unattractive. His dead wife is the daughter of a French Resistence member. Could this be important to the movie?"
1,trash masquerading as art,"Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess."
1,Horrible!,"Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least."
4,mhhh...,"Marlon Brando was an extraordinay actor, and this is what you see in this movie, a great Mr. Brando performance.I had great expectations about this movie. But I'm a little disapointed. I think the picture will be erotic in a superlative degree, but no, is a good drama story with some erotic content. I like more other movies with more erotic content as The Lover, In the Realm of the Senses, David Lynch's Lost Highway, and, as well I like other movies with some erotic content tha can be considered bizarre as David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Heavenly Creatures, among others."
2,A movie that redefines tedium,"Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about. It can be fast-forwarded to the end without anything being missed. Alas, poor Brando, we knew him well."
4,"It's a kind of unusual movie hat you can't see these days. Lots of sexual scenes, Keep it away from kids.","Marlon Brando was a mrevel. Very unorthodox acting style. The movie, however, contains lots of sexual scenes that must be kept away from children. Very unusual story."
2,Unappealing and unnecessarily perverted,"I went into this film thinking that I would see an unorthodox film involving sex. I've seen many films that could fit this description such as ""Happiness"" by Todd Solondz and ""Romance"" by Catherine Breillat, but unlike those films, I failed to see a point in this one.The sex scenes were extremely grotesque in their graphic and perverse nature, especially the scene involving sodomy.I can't say I would reccommend this film to anyone. The reason that it gets 2 stars out of 5 is because I think Marlon Brando was very convincing and entertaining, I just failed to see the point in this film as a whole and therefore I cannot give it a good rating."
2,Can't be that great.,"I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis. The film did not leave a lasting impression on me, unlike some of the other films I saw around the same time frame. I can hardly remember a single detail about it. Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art. But since I can barely recall having seen Last Tango, it leaves me with the impression that this film is not a great work of art as the urband legand makers would have it."
1,Couldn't wait for it to be over!,"I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back."
1,A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY,This is one of the worst show I've ever seen. Don't waste your money buying it. Your time is better spent cleaning out gutters than watching this tripe.I would have rated this show minus stars if it were possible.
4,Unforgettable,"Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
3,An interesting movie for adults,"This was an interesting movie with good actors and an explicit plot.It is worth seeing for Marlon Brando's great performance.This was a good movie for people that are into trashy romance.However,it isn't for all audiences but it is a compelling and fascinating film for adults.Very powerfull ."
3,Good Performance by Brando,I was looking foward to seeing this movie after reading all the reviews on here but I was dissapointed when I finally watched it. The movie is overlong and drags on although Brando has a few great scences the movie itself isnt so great. Save yourself the money and rent it.
3,"So much potential, so little payoff","""Last Tango in Paris"" is a curious mixture of brilliance and tedium. Brando's acting is finely honed, and the direction and cinematography are striking and atmospheric. The best parts of the film -- several of the scenes between the lovers, and Brando's monologue to his dead wife -- are darkly haunting.The problem, however, is that the memorable scenes are separated by long stretches of stupendous boredom. The entire subplot with Jean-Pierre Leaud is weak and annoying, and much of the dialogue throughout the movie is atrocious -- the sort of rambling dreck that one might expect from a college student trying to sound ""deep."" It's as if the film's editor was incapable of distinguishing real emotion from sophomoric posturing and simply left everything in the final print.Rent before buying if at all possible. Reactions to this film will vary wildly."
4,The best the film will ever look...,"I'm going to break the trend of a life time on Amazon now and comment on the actual item in question the blu ray disk of the movie ""Last Tango in Paris"" and not the movie itself. The good news is the film has a had a very subtle remastering for blu ray with the studio being sensitive to the source material while keeping the original palette of the movie without making it look to artificial in Hi Def. As long as you don't have your black levels set to high you won't be disappointed. Sound is a big improvement with a mono DTS remastering which does the job making the most important aspect the dialogue crystal clear. No extras but the trailer I'm afraid."
2,Materpiece that needs an overhall,faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!
3,Much Ado About Nothing,"I had not seen this movie before. It is an oldie and I thought I would buy it because of all of the hype it had received. It was as so-so movie by today's standards. I guess I am not a Brando fan. He always seemed moody, much like James Dean. This movie is no exception. I would not recommend this movie to a friend."
3,gets better as it goes,"I thought that this movie wasn't as bold as I thought it was going to be, and I think most people will not like it. However, the movie certainly has its moments, such as the eulogy Brando gives his wife, and his eventual divulging of his personal information to Jeanne. I love the line: ""I'm still a good stickman, even if I can't have any kids...I come from a time when a guy like me could walk into a joint like this, pick up a girl like you and call her a bimbo.""Also, I think college guys sit up in their seats when Paul has the balls to say ""Repeat after me..."" (i don't want to give it away)All in all, I think there are definitely people out there who can enjoy this film, and I'm still deciding if I am one of them."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie in cinematic history,"Finally saw the much-vaunted Last Tango in Paris. On the DVD case, a reviewer squeals: ""The most erotically powerful movie ever made!"" Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like ""vacant"", ""nihilistic"", ""empty"", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."
3,"little plot, unerotic, but nice photography","This movie is overrated. The plot is quite weak. I did not find it erotic at all.There is a fair amount of sex, but the characters of Paul (Marlon Brando) and Jeanne (Maria Schneider) are insufficiently developed. We learn that Paul's wife recently killed herself, but other than that the affair between them appears to be driven by boredom, escapism, and chance. What are the characters feeling, other than animal attraction?? Brando's acting is excellent, but with such a weak plot, it seems a waste. The cinematography is very nice - lots of darkness."
2,what's the big deal?,"This has to be the most overrated movie ever made. Even by 1970's standards, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. Marlon Brando is just his usual brooding self. The girl is extremely beautiful, but even if she was naked through the entire movie, I cannot understand why anyone considers this a cinema masterpiece."
5,"Great bindings, good intro critique","We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 1 contains: Hamlet; Othello; King Lear; Machbeth"
2,Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes,"I have greatly enjoyed reading the hard cover Everyman's edition of Shakespeare's Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. The hard cover books, which come in multiple volumes, are portable, have a nice type face, have excellent explanatory notes and excellent introductory essays about the plays. I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language. Many words have changed meaning significantly over time and a modern dictionary is only modestly helpful.It would be great if Amazon could get the Everyman's edition formatted for the Kindle."
5,Don't buy the wrong one!,"This review is not about the product -- Everyman Tragedies Volume 2, which is wonderful -- but a warning to use care when purchasing. My first time through, I clicked into the ""New"" options from $0.73, and was directed to several well priced books. The only problem is, they are not the volume advertised on this page. Instead it's three plays in an unattractive volume from something called Ann Arbor Media. So be careful!"
5,Brush Up Your Shakespeare Editions!,"None of the other reviews here refer to what is actually being offered on this page: the 3-volume set of Shakespeare's plays (Histories, Tragedies, Comedies) published by The Heritage Press, commonly known as The Heritage Shakespeare.This set became an instant classic when it was published in 1958, and if you're interested in a beautifully printed, edited, and illustrated edition of the plays at a reasonable price, you cannot go wrong with the Heritage."
5,And I even didn't like this singer! But now I do!,"Marco Borsato wasn't one of my favourite singers here in Holland. But that changed when I heard several of the songs on this album. As soon as the CD got out, I run to the store and bought the album. There are several slow songs, but also some songs with ritme. Marco Borsato is on his best at this CD and I think it is even better than his new album Luid en Duidelijk. A ""must have"" Cd for every Borsato fan!"
4,Fresh and intense look at who we were and are,"This is a fascinating and valuable look at the United States presented with a number of rarely seemed photographs. You will learn something here even if you think you know the whole story of our nation's 200+ years. The only caveats are a few photos which, while presenting some of the true (and unfortunate) incidents of our history, may be too graphic for children (and some adults!) Overall a fine volume worthy of any library."
5,Finally - a PRACTICAL guide,"Mark's book is an excellent, easy to understand read, which I found extremely helpful.Most books on TOC deal with a lot of theory, or case studies. This is the first book I've read that goes into incredible detail on how to implement TOC using the author's years of experience in this field.A must-read if you are plannig to implement TOC."
2,Not a good value for the price,"Given the price of this book, I felt that was not a good value for the price. Too little information for a hardcover book that supposed to be a guide for manufacturers on how to implement TOC."
4,Kind of small and Revoltech Joint system is overrated,"It's small for the money. I'm just used to a minimum of 6"" when I pay this price. Also, the Revoltech Joint system is nice if I plan on reposing a figure often, but I don't. I do so once in a while and when joints get loose I apply a little clear mounting/holding wax in inconspicuous spots. Also, with regular-ball-jointed figs I don't have to ""click"" to the next lock-step position; with this I do. I just don't buy the marketing hype.That all said this is a great-looking fig. Does it fall under mecha? If so, Revoltech mechs always look uber hip. If only they'd be sized to fit in with other figs, like DCD, Matty DC or Hasbro Marvel figs.It's educational in learning about Giant Robo, a former pop culture phenom from Japan that was updated in the nineties. Wiki has some great articles on it."
5,Tubas by a Waterfall in the Canyons of Your Mind --,This is more entertaining than anything should be allowed to be. Avoid operating heavy machinery while listening.And don't listen to it while asleep or you'll wake up on the floor wondering how you came to be so elevated.
2,Into the Wilderness It's NOT,"I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition."
5,what a great story,"I liked this. Better than the first one, I think, although I have to go re-read that one. I especially liked the way the characters are developing into more complex people. The scenes at sea are wonderful, but I have to say that I'm glad she didn't leave them in Scotland. Too much Scotland these days in love stories. Don't people realize it's wet and cold there most of the time? I'm looking forward to the next installment back on the ny frontier. Give me mosquitos over scotsmen anyday.I also have a theory about the reviews here that call this book boring (there are about five of them, I think). There are three reasons that come to mind to call this boring: somebody glued the pages together on you, you're brain dead, you've got something against the author. I suspect those reviews were all written by the same boring person. A vendetta? Sour grapes? Oxygen deprivation? Who knows."
2,Not Worth My Time,"I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me."
2,Dawn on a Distant Shore,"I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters."
1,I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.,"I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and ""Boots"" had no chemistry which was very disappointing"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I ""skimmed"" over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper."
2,Yawn on Distant Shore.....,"I found this sequel to be a big disappointment and pales in comparison to Donati's first book. This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was."
2,The story falls over,"The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place."
1,Yawn.,I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged. I will definitly borrow her next book from the library!
2,Disappointed,Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.
5,Not as good as the first but still excellent,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one, but I usually think the first book in a series is the best anyway. All in all this is an excellent series, recommend!"
1,Not as good as her other books,"I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better."
2,"Good, but I expected more","After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license."
5,review,"I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
5,what a story,"The kind of book that makes you turn off the phone and ignore the kids. Those two reviewers here who said ""boring""? I'm wondering if they read the same book. I suppose they need a nuclear explosion or the like to keep them happy. What I like is, interesting characters in challenging situations, and you've got that here in abundance.The first one was very good, but this one is even better. More tightly written. Miss Donati has come into her stride. Bring on Hidden Wolf!"
2,A boring disappointment!,"Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money."
1,BORING!,"Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon."
4,easy to use for one person with kids,"Bought this to go camping with my kids who are young. I can set the tent up in 15 minutes without help; no hassles. And the first time I set it up, I shattered one of the fiberglass poles; it still worked, but called the company -- mailed it back and got a new on in 4 weeks; great customer service."
5,EUEKA BITTERROOT 11,"I just got this to replace a little 2 people tent as my daughter is old enough now to go camping whit us. Yes It is very roomy for the three of us but I can for sure use the extra space. We camp at a lagoon 35F at night to 55F at noon. No condensation, good wind protection and resistance. Very well constructed. You will need help to put on the canopy on windy situations. It's a very good option between a 3 seasons and a 2 seasons because of the protection and waterproof and the big windows and height."
5,Euphoric About Eureka Bitterroot Tent,"We have owned this tent for seven months now and can attest that the manufacturer description and majority of other reviews are spot on (thus far)! While we have yet to put it through any rough weather tests, we have found the tent to possess a practical design, spacious interior, a height that makes it comfortable for standing, well made, and easy to put up and take down. The only suggestion I would have for Eureka is to include metal tent stakes instead of the cheap easily breakable plastic ones."
5,perfect campground tent,"You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."
3,Lose the annoying sound effects,"Great music but too many distracting sound effects (chirping birds, etc). Not sure why some reggae mixing engineers insist on adding these sound effects over the music...they often ruin a great album such as this one. ""Free Africa"" is much better."
3,Not the Twinkle's Best,"I had high hopes for this virgin reissue but in the end I was slightly disappointed. The majority of the songs lack a certain punch even though the musicianship is typical late 70's Jamaica- top notch and flawless. The Twinkle Brother's output is unique in the world of reggae in the sense that their 80's LP's seem stronger that their 70's LP's. If you can locate a copy of the mid 80's stunner ""Underground"" pick that one up instead."
5,STEINER: Virginia City/The Lost Patrol,"The powerful and melodic music from Virginia City really stands out against today's soundtracks of rolling drums and string chords. Oddly, the volume on my disk is rather low. Enjoy some of the very best movie music here!"
4,Good deal,Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.
1,Beware - Product is not as pictured,"While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."
5,Halloween movie,"Not only was it a great scare for our Halloween movie scareathon, it was a great bargain and in excellent condition. Thank you"
3,"Good start, weak finish.","Started out pretty good. Then gets kinda silly when the ""monsters"" get into the story. Had some pretty scary moments."
3,slow moving but eventually satisfying,"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good horror movie. It begins with a dramatic opening scene, then moves on to a group of young women adventurers exploring a rather unusual cave. The succeding scenes of cave climbing drag a bit but tension gradually developes and the action then gets exciting, horrific and really interesting with a series of highly dramatic frightening scenes involving ""cave creatures"" and leading to a satisfying conclusion. The movie reminds me another movie: The Cave."
5,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER,"WHEN THE MOVIE STARTED I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE PLOT ABOUT, AND THAT REALLY WORKED GOOD FOR ME. AFTER A VERY SHOCKING SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT, SIX WOMEN DECIDED TO EXPLORE A CAVE AND THEY FIND WHAT TRUE HORROR IS. I WAS SHOCKED AND STUCK TO MY SIT FROM THE BEGINNING TILL THE END OF THE MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD AND WELL DONE, DIRECTED AND EDITED. VISUAL EFFECTS ARE OUTSTANDING. I WON'T TELL ANYTHING ELSE TO AVOID TO SPOIL IT WHEN YOU WATCH IT. BUT TRUST ME, THIS MOVIES IS SO GOOD THAT NOW, I WILL FOLLOW CLOSER ALL WORKS BY DIRECTOR NEIL MARSHALL. SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THE MOVIE HAS WON 3 IMPORTANT AWARDS,1- British Independent Film Award ""Best Director: Neil Marshall""2- British Independent Film Award ""Best Technical Achievement""3- Empire Award ""Best Horror Movie""AND HAS 4 OTHER NOMINATIONS... THE MOVIE IS A TOTAL SUCCESS, THUMPS UP FOR NEIL MARSHALL"
4,"Depression, Death, Despair, Clostrophobia!!","This is a great movie for the horror film buff. Not only does it provide the viewer with the guts, gore, and blood that we all love, but it also explores real fears, such as clostrophobia, lonliness, and betrayal. The movie does a good job of making the monsters seem somewhat human and the viewer almost feels a sense of sorrow for the creatures, who are unable to see, but have evolved a keen sense of hearing in their underground caveworld. The ending isn't a typical horror film ending, where the heroine makes it out alive. That, alone, makes the movie worth watching. I believe this one was definitely worth money."
3,Excellent Horror,"I saw this movie at a drive-in over the summer. PERFECT location for a movie like this. It made it even creepier to watch it outside. This movie was brutal in the way it wracks your nerves, since you can never quite tell what is coming at these girls. The movie is well shot considering the location. It kept my adrenaline pumping pretty much from start to finish. My one complaint would be that there are too many characters. Cleary it was done so that there were enough to kill off. However, since at least 3-4 of the characters did not distinguish themselves, I had no emotional investment in their survival. Must see horror movie!"
1,over-rated!,poor acting. somehow has rated 4/5 stars which means 4/5 people that rated it are idiots. has about 3 scary parts total. the acting is horrifying though. scariest part of the movie by a long shot was the acting.
3,Not as scary as some reviews said...,"Ok, we just got done watching The Descent & we were kind of disappointed! I rented it b/c some reviews said it was scary but it was SO not!"
3,"Good, not Great.",I assumed this was based on the book of the same name. The book was MUCH better. But the movie was good enough once I got past expecting to see something that approximated the book. It's worth a rental. I wouldn't buy it.
2,Hard to feel anything for the characters,"This movie really left me cold. Just couldn't feel any empathy with the characters. In fact, I kinda ended up rooting for the monsters! I mean, here they are in their cave, maybe venturing out to snack on the odd lost kid or something. Then these adventure-seeking bimbos show up and act suprised when the monsters want to make them part of the buffet! Hey, who's on who's turf, huh? Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience."
1,movie was a waste of money,"this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole. thats it, the movie sucked dont buy it."
2,"Kind of lame, as most horror movies are","I'm not usually one for horror movies, but a friend of mine made me watch ""The Descent"" with her, and it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy ""The Descent"" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one."
4,Gets better once in the cave...,"I started enjoying the film, once the caving started..Deep down below the surface, everthing starts getting creepy, tightand your heart starts beating faster...as our adventurers are about tofind out that they are not alone.Above average creepiness with great direction puts this movie above othercave movies. Should'nt dissapoint.Extra features are great...when the film is good. You get to see the workand effort of all involved....and some of these predator actors are someof the best around. Enjoy."
2,It could have been really good...but,"Some things were good, but more were bad, here's a run down of the positive and the negative:(+)side:1.the setting of an underground cave2.couple moments that make you jump3.great concept(-)side:1.story2.cast3.troll creatures4.tried to take itself too seriously"
2,The Descent?,"Almost a full hour into this movie before you see what the movie is even supposed to be about. It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of ""horror"" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like ""Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles"". If your going to advertise a movie as ""scary"" and ""horror"" than MAKE IT LIKE ONE. This is just a chick flick with some ""BOO!s"" tossed in towards the end, stay away from this failed flick."
5,Warning!,Do not buy this film if you are afraid of small dark cramped spaces underground. This movie will scare the bee-jabbers out of you. Other than that -- it's a good thrill ride.
3,You'll root for the ghouls to finish off this team spelunking misfits,"All we needed was a bunch of female egotists doing what normally is [executed] by witless males in a movie like this. They're over their heads (or under, in this case) when a gaggle of women decide to go spelunking and wind up being ripped to shreds and eaten piecemeal (pun intended) by a bunch of very hungry cave ghouls (for want of a more descriptive term).What follows is the usual ""offing"" one-by-one of the adventurists. Well, not all of them. Horrific scenes (guffaw!) are not too subtle (chortle!), bloody (snicker!), and very predictable. The spelunkers get their ""just desserts"".... Or, at least the ghouls do (snort!).Blood, gore, screams, yelling, dismemberment - almost like watching an old Ozzie Osborn concert. Still a very entertaining horror flick."
4,I screamed for once!!,"Yes, I know what you're thinking. ""Another one of those pick em' off one-at-a-time horror flicks..."" And it is. But it's also more then that. This movie actually made me scream and I'm getting freaked out just writing about it in this dark, dark room. A bloodbath that makes you squirm...all the while enjoying the effect the adrenalin rush has on you. I am not claustrophobic, but there are a few scenes that made me feel like I was trapped in a rocky cave with no means of escaping. ""The Descent"" broke one of the basic major rules of writing a horror story. I can't tell you which one, but don't expect a big twist after you travel through this never-ending cave, fighting for your life. I'd say rent it first and then see if you want to buy it....it's not for everyone."
5,Best horror film...ever.,"Before this film no other film has even come close to scaring me. Those films mentioned above are like watching the Teletubbies in comparison to this film. I even consciously considered getting up and leaving the cinema through this film because I thought my mind just couldn't handle the tension any more. The action simply never stops once it starts. And, I won't spoil anything, but the first gory scene of the film: that kind of stuff shouldn't even be allowed! I never thought the line could be moved so far."
1,Another one bites the dust..,"Yet another cheesy, cliche horror movie about a bunch of dumb idiots who die one after the other, sometimes in cool ways. Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh. Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."
1,LOUSY,This movie was about an inch of me gonging it. It was like I was in the cave watching it. I plan to sell it to Blockbuster because it is not worthy to be in my collection.The best part was the end.
1,Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and,"Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things.Hey girls, don't be so cheap and rent a guide who has done that cave before...duhhh.It's hard to feel sorry for dumb and dumber and dumber and...."
1,"trash, i wish I could give it no stars!!!!!!","I love horror movies!!! But this is really a horrible movie, the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used. The actresses were very bad at acting, and not in that cool b-horror movie way either, they suck. I know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trash,THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS ONLY 90 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!Guess I will start having to go back to the Asian import shop for good horror."
3,It's ok - not the best but not the worst either!,"The beginning is a little slow - and pointless - the middle is ok as far as scary goes. There is way too much cursing which sounds out-of-place. You don't believe it so it makes it seem fake. The ""show-down"" was a let down with a stupid ending. Then the ending itself was stupid too. I saw someone say it had the ""typical American happy ending"" - I don't understand that since no one leaves the movie happy! Again - the scary parts are semi scare worthy - but don't expect much of a resolution to the so-called story."
2,FAIR,"THE MOVIE FOR ME STARTED WHEN THEY GOT LOST IN THE CAVE. I KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO GET YOU TO KNOW THE CHARCTERS IN THE BEGINNING. THE DIALOGUE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DID KNOW ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK THE CHARCTERS WERE STRONG ENOUGH. MAYBE THEY NEEDED STRONGER ACTRESSES LIKE SIGOURNY WEAVER, LINDA HAMILTON EVEN ANGELA BASSET. BUT THE MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS. IT'S GOOD TO WATCH, AND IT'S GOOD TO PUT ON WHEN YOU HAVE MOVIE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS. :-)"
2,descent into stupidity,I just watched this for a second time after about a year. I gave it 2 stars because of its science fiction merits but would have given it one star otherwise. A group of women descend into a cavern and can't get back out due to multiple stupid mistakes and underground monsters. The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on. Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.
1,SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!,"I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!"
1,Disappointing hollywood formula ending,"Buyer beware. This is a version with a feel good hollywood formula ending. It is not the original, it was redone to give the US viewers a somewhat happy and typical USA horror ending / resolution, (pretty symbolic of our countries state I would say). Get the European version. I bought this thing w/o realizing they redid it, now I am buying the original---"
2,Don't waste your time...,"What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?"
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE:D,This is a great and powerful movie. It starts out slow but then it gets going. It is a great movie and everything about it is great. If you are into horror and monster like creatures then you will like this movie.
3,not bad,"Technically good, but could have perhaps benefitted from a slightly stronger plot. Now while Neil Marshall has said that he was pleased that audiences didn't quite know what to make of the ending...Is she dead? Still in the cave? One of the creatures? I did not find it interesting enough to want to watch it over and over to try to figure such things out."
5,I wish their were more like this,"First no spoilers here but I will say theier is a build up in the movie,but when it hits the fan,it really hits the fan.I havnt had that feeling in my gut in a long time,not since the first Alien film,they felt similiar to me.This movie is not for the faint of heart although not as gorry as some previous movies when its used here it is very effective,this movie will make you feel unsettled,this is for sure the best creature film i've seen in years,bring your nerves.Sum it up I wont be in any caves for sure anytime in the near future,and yes go ahead and buy this no need to waste your money on a rent you will want this in your collection.Instant Classic"
3,not bad..,I have always wanted to see this movie and now I have...I can take this movie title off my bucket list
5,Terrorific Extreme Adventuring,"When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure."
3,"Probably Overrated, 3.5 stars","This film's pretty good, nothing great but not bad either. IMO, all the high ratings this movie got are partly due to the lack of quality horror films which makes this look excellent in comparison. But its not scary at all; the film uses a lot of the typical, cheap boo type scare scenes that won't get you too jumpy unless you're a complete horror flick noob.There were elements of the film that I really did like though. Its a really dark film (yeah duh its in a cave) and the claustrophobia was done to good effect. I felt more queasy watching the movie cuz of that than anything else. One scene I felt was done very well was when the main character falls down into the monsters' pit, completely dark, and essentially uses the camcorder as her set of eyes. On a side note, the US ending is lousy...completely typical and cliched type horror movie ending. The real ending gives the film deeper meaning and also opens up other possibilities to what really happened in the film."
5,Awesome Movie,"I only have one word for this Movie ''Awesome'' , the movie have anything one horror movie need, you need see this movie. 5 star for this."
2,Not bad for a budget movie,I thought they did a good job with makeup in the movie but the script and the way it was directed was not typical for a movie of this type. Made it feel more budget.
3,"Boring, Predicatable.","The girls are hot... but it's just boring. There are a couple of scary parts but mostly it's just junk in a nice package. It helps that the girls are hot, the cinematography and pacing is superb... but it's just boring and ultimately you just don't care."
3,Action packed!,"It's more of an action film than a horror film, though there is lots of gore. Not much of a story, but there are a few psychological twists when the friends begin to turn on one another. Totally entertaining, lots of fighting ugly cave creatures and tons of suspense."
4,Scary,"This movie freaked me out quite a bit, and I'm a bit unsure why. Yes, it's kinda gory, but I think the dark, clostrophobic nature is what got me. Definetly worth at least a rent."
5,Intense horror/suspense,"Simply spine chilling!!! After a bit of drama in the beginning to set the relationship between these friends, the movie erupts into an action/thriller that had me biting my nails (something I haven't done for years). This movie is 'otherworldly' and may scare some would-be spelunkers away from dark, creepy caves forever, but it's worth the risk if you love horror. If you liked 'Dog Soldiers', you'll 'bite into' this one. Grab your popcorn and hang on because once the creatures take the stage your eyes are glued wide open. (o.k, so I viewed bloody scenes from between my fingers the first time). I watched it twice and still jumped at a few things I knew were coming. Very well-written. The cave/climbing shots and immense fear factor never go over the top, but they sure do raise your blood pressure a few notches. Excellent horror film! I believe this director is really on a roll.P.S. Be sure to check out the beautiful mountain scenery.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,The Descent.,"A Bunch of Women who want to be Men well not all of them, go into a Cave(no pun intended) and meet some interesting Things on the way down(That's what she said), and so these ""Things"" Or Creatures apparently have it out for them, Short and Silly review but hey it is what is,I did like the Movie and I certainly Enjoyed it More than The Descent 2."
2,disappointing,"I didn't find the Descent to be a very interesting film. It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere."
3,*The Cave* copycat,"How is *Descent* any different from *The Cave*? *Descent* uses an all female cast. The creatures that are haunting them are exactly aliens (as in *The Cave*) but rather as evidences/results of Darwin's evolution.A year after losing her husband and daughter to a tragic accident, Sarah rejoins her friends for a trip of a nature adventure. This time, they're going caving.The problem is that they go down a cave that they thought was a charted one. However, they soon learn that one of the girls decided to try an uncharted cave to name themselves. Of course, of all caves, they just happened to go into one that is littered with blind, screeching and bloodthirsty creatures.There are a couple of scenes that will make you jump. But other than that, there really isn't anything special about this movie...especially if you've already seen *The Cave*. Neither one is better than the other."
2,Desucked,If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the movie I would have given it 1 star.
1,Slllloooowwwwwww and slower,"I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut."
3,at least it wasn't as bad as the other horror films this year,"It starts out as an intriguing thriller - horror movie.. and it ends up a complete joke.. we are drawn into this exciting cave expediton and when the monsters living inside are finally revealed.. it turns out to be a complete waste of our time.. At least there is some suspense leading up to our dissapointment something we can't say for the other atrocious horror films this year (pulse, grudge 2, etc.) Oh how luke warm i feel.."
3,"Creepy and claustrophobic, but lacks something.","For those that can be patient for the gore, you will be pretty well grossed out as you would hope to be by the end of The Descent. However, before it gets to that point, the movie drags and lags a bit before getting there. I've seen better and I've surely seen worse. I'd give this movie 5 stars for the gore and horribly closed-in feelings you will have watching this, but the rest of it is just ok and you'll find yourself more interested in your big bucket of popcorn for a little while until the women discover there's some kind of creatures down there in the caves with them. If small spaces and lots of gore are what you desire, then check this movie out but be prepared to endure quite a bit of movie before it actually gets good."
5,Brilliant!,"The best horror film to come out in 10 years, easy. If you are in any way claustraphobic this film will be hard to sit through. The cave is terrifying in itself, which is quite an acheivement considering the modest budget. As the women descend deeper into the cave I felt as if I was watching A Stanly Kubrick or a Ridly Scott film. The buidup to the real threat is fantastic, and theaters will be filled with screams when the movie hits the U.S next month. I think the American studio cut the real ending off so they can sell the 'unrated' DVD afterwards. They know they have a hit on their hands, so they will milk it for all it's worth. This version is a must have for any horror fan that doesn't want to wait a year for a proper US release."
4,Good suspense is back!,Really a bit of a sleeper. Not a ton of press but a great ride none the less. The Blu-ray is a visual improvement over the DVD.
2,Dark and Confusing,"I had some problems with this film. It seems pretty implausible to me that six potential models would even take on this expedition. Even if I accept this premise, none of the characters distinguished themselves, so I therefore had no emotional investment in any of them. When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two."
2,Looks good on blu-ray,"Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. If you like that, then you will love this. It has a good plot, movie keeps you on your toes, but the blood and gore in the movie is apparent and graphic. Not suitable for children, period!"
3,Visceral and disturbing,"""The Descent"" is the latest offering from the makers of the ""Saw"" series bent on frightening us with splattering blood, sickening crunches and a steadily diminishing body count.After the shocking opening scene, the tale begins harmlessly enough with a group of women rock jocks going caving in an unmapped cave supposedly in North Carolina (though I gave no idea where the elk and moose come from). However, the group is soon in trouble from the dangers of the cave itself and its... well, other inhabitants.The movie lives up to its name as the story descends deeper and deeper into visceral terror. The cinematography, at times reminiscent if ""The Blair Witch Project,"" is frightening in a heart-pounding, way. And if that's what you're looking for, ""The Descent"" delivers. The movie is startling and gory, and what it lacks in believability, it makes up for with brutality. If you thought ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Saw II"" weren't bloody enough, you'll leave ""The Descent"" satisfied."
3,Pretty intense for me,"If you want a film that will scare the crap out of you this could be it, but it was just a little too intense for me. The whole film made me uncomfortable in a claustorphobic sort of way. Even without creatures to menace the six ladies out for adventure, this film was intense and scary. I could see where a fan of gore would give this 5 stars. It just was not my type of movie...I probably shouldn't even be writing a review, but, oh well. I'm happy I watched it...Convinced me to stay out of caves, although the creatures I think are ripoffs from a short story by H.P. Lovecraft that I read last summer. One thing I didn't get..The ending...What was that about? Did she or didn't she? Was she or wasn't she? Boy I hate that..Now I have to think about it over night."
5,GREAT !!,"This is a great movie !I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this, but I'm very glad I took a chance on it. It has beautiful scenery, good actors and it's really quite scary ! Iv'e been in a cave before and went much farther into it than expected for a guy who doesn't like confined spaces. This movie captures the feel and fear involved in exploring the underground. If I ever do go into another one, I will be watching for the freaky creatures that live within the caves of this movie. These guys(or gals)natually freak me out! The way they look, move, and sound are great. There is plenty of suspense and alot of scary scenes.I was a little ""put-off"" by the ending,which I guess is the prelude to ""Decent II"", which I haven't seen yet. Over all, it's worth renting, or buying. It's a classic !!"
4,Movie great! Blu Ray not so much,"This is a great movie. However, as I commonly say, I can fully enjoy a movie without having to watch it in its entirety. The second half of this movie, i.e., when the monsters really come out, can get a little less than fully entertaining. That notwithstanding, the characters are interesting and engaging, and the concept is fun in an adventurish kind of way. Even better, one of the characters wears an Arcteryx jacket - by far the best adventure gear on the planet (forget Northface or Spyder - overpriced garbage)! HOWEVER, while the movie is great, the Blu-Ray transfer is not so. I owned the original (SD) version, then bought HD because I'm a Blu-Ray junkie, only to be highly disappointed. Lots of noise in the video transfer, far too much in fact for a movie only recently created. I don't advise someone buying to replace their SD version unless they're lost to the Blu-Ray OCD gods like I am."
4,A Nice Surprise,A bunch of adventure seeking women decide to explore a cave as part of their yearly get together. They discover more than bats and stalactites on this exploration.I had no idea what this movie was about when I started watching it but I was pleasantly surprised. I was not familiar with any of the actresses but they definitely gave it their all in the cramped quarters of the cave. The movie reminded me of some of the best zombie movies but the tension is not left all up to the creatures. The setting plays a huge beautiful role. I highly recommend this film.
4,Surprising good and suspenseful,"I really liked this movie. It had an all female cast but not the typical stereotype of being helpless and defenseless. The movie moves fast and has solid pieces of suspense throughout. The ending catches you off guard, not the usual ending. Good solid acting."
4,ATTN: Instant video watchers. This is NOT the original ending...,"Although the title may say ""unedited original cut"" it is NOT. The end of this movie in the Americanized ending and not the ORIGINAL UK ending (which is MUCH MUCH MUCH better).Don't fall for the same trick I did at get the crappy American version. Go rent the DVD instead, and make sure you select the alternate ending for the ending!This movie would have been five stars instead of four if it wasn't for the American ending."
1,Horrible film.,"This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
1,overated and robbed,"Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere! I am sorry but I found nothing new. Perhaps its me, I am retard! but I felt I was robbed of time. I found it lacked story, and the moral of the story was odd. ok, in the end, the main character dreamed it all--did she? The Journey to the Centre of the Earth had much more imagination and charm by the rope length!"
1,This is a joke!!,"I was really excited to rent this based on the 4 star reviews. Needless to say once I started watching it, I was bored for the first hour. Then these ridiculous looking monsters appear out of nowhere.ABSOLUTELY BORING, HARD TO SEE, and STUPID. WORST MOVIE EVER.. try Halloween orExorcist if you want a REAL horror movie."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time."
2,It COULD have been a great movie . . ..,"Okay. Let's start with the good. The atmosphere was suitably claustrophobic. The background music fit the feel of the movie. The crawlers were well-designed.***SPOILER ALERT***Unfortunately, the movie did very little to make me empathize with the ""heroine"". Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves. Well, at least until part 2 . . .."
4,Buy from UK,Hey amazon shoppers. Just to let you know you can pick up the descent from amazon.co.uk for about 3.99 as we have had it on DVD release for quite a while now over in Britain. So why buy a cinema ticket for that price when you can buy the DVD before it's even released in America for about another 4 months. Hope this helps. Adam
4,I'll keep this short,"Since other reviewers have pretty much summed up all my thoughts on this movie, I'll leave it at this: Imagine last year's ""The Cave"" if it didn't suck balls."
4,Critical Commentary,Great Technical/Critical Commentary.A little heavy on Source Criticism and weak on the possibility of Mosaic Authorship.Does a great job of handling Hebrew and Literary structure.A must have for the Scholar/Pastor.
3,So-So movie,"This movie is okay, not the greatest, but not the worst. I can't see why so much was made of Victor Mature, he's not really that great of an actor or that handsome."
2,Too Old,"I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). The lipstick I received was the same quality of old as the one I already own. The lipsticks are old and should be thrown out! For $17, the vendor should not be selling."
1,Terrible! Beyound-use date,"Lipstick that arrived is so old, it even smells worse then my granny's oldest lipstick which she takes out from the tube with a match!I had to throw it away...."
4,Introduction to the Study of Insects 6th Edition,"Good ""keys"" are hard to come by, especially for insects. This book was suggested by a well respected Entomologist, and is a good book. However, with the changes brought on by DNA, a new book needs to be done."
3,A good book for some purposes,"This a good book for who seek for taxonomic keys to identify insects in the laboratory. Its large size make it difficult in the field. Some aspects are neglected, e.g. physiology and evolution. I think there are a lot of better books for these subjects."
2,Only a music producer can like this.,"Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation."
1,beware,"The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant."
1,happy i only wasted money for 2 Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound,Music Experience in 3-Dimensional SoundThis cd shouldnt have been recordedMy fault i bougt this cdWas tempted of the dts recordingI could have readed other rewiewsThe experience listen to this is saddnes over own stupidityLoke1858
1,oh my goodness!,"If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dollar must have dropped through the floor."
4,A great thriller from the 70s,"I remember as a kid being scared to death by the TV commercials for this one. Every time it came on my sister and I would freak out. I hadn't seen the film years but always remembered it as a real twisted thriller. Well, now it's available again and years later it still remains a great, creepy thriller. Hopkins is sooo young here but already shows what a tremendous actor he is. Ann-Margret was still a true beauty and Burgess Meredith is just great. Eeerie, creepy and well acted. This one is still a winner all these years later. Oh, one other thing, those TV commercials - there on here and there still scary."
4,"The dummy ""FATS"" is hysterical!!!!",ALL I can really say about the movie is that the puppet steals the show. It really didn't matter how weak the story was because the puppet's comments made the show.
3,Magic is Fair,"I'm saddened by this lackluster movie, because it could have been really good had it been edited a bit. Hopkins can't be faulted, his performance is great. Yes, the dummy was scary and disturbing, but the film is unrelentingly grim."
1,Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me,"Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
4,An Early Glimpse at a Future Star,"With his recent film successes as an actor of note, it is likely that Sir Anthony would not want to be reminded of his work on this modest thriller. He shouldn't be worried, though, because he delivers an outstanding performance as the oft-repeated role of a ventriloquist whose alter ego takes over. His Jekyl/Hyde turn as both Corky and Fats the dummy shows that he, even then, was an actor on the rise.Ample support - no pun intended - is given by Ann-Margret as the love of Corky's youth, Ed Lauter as her husband, and the always dependable Burgess Meredith as the manager/agent who finds out too late how ill his star performer really is.With an ominous yet quiet score from Jerry Goldsmith, the film never descends into gore as is so common in current horror flicks. Although not one of the best of the genre, the flick is still a worthwhile viewing experience.Better than average and the rating reflects a 3 1/2 star rating rounded off to 4."
4,Magic,This is an Anthony Hopkins movie that should be seen by any Anthony Hopkins fan. He is young but what a job of acting. Ann Margret also stars in this movie. I had it on VHS tape and was so happy to find it on Amazon on DVD.I would recommend it.
4,"Magic, on Blu Ray, starrring Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret is a well crafted film.","I like this BluRay release of the Anthony Hopkins/Ann Margret film. The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing."
4,A ventriloquists nightmare,"Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky.) The story follows an up and coming ventriloquist ""Corky"" and his dummy ""fats"" on their near rise to stardom. This is a very entertaining yet creepy film where the dummy is in control of the ventriloquist(very similar to a Twilight Zone episode.) Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in ""Magic"". I definately recommend this classic if you need a change from the typical cookie cutter horror/suspense films out there now."
2,great movie massacred by tape quality,"One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon."
2,The Only Dummy Is The Writer,"""Magic"" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book."
3,The commericals scared me to death,"I also admire this film for the sheer terror I experienced by watching the commerical when I was a young lad. The dummy says:Abracadabra I sit on his knee, Presto-Chango now he is me, Hocus-Pocus we put her to bed, Magic is Fun, We're DeadOK, it may not sound like a big deal here, but when you are 8 and this scary looking dummy is dominating your TV screen, you don't forget about it. By the way, much thanks to my sister who made me watch that commerical when I was 7 years old. My therapist says because of that, everything I suffer from is your fault! :)"
4,classic,"i got this for my dad. it is super creepy and worth a watch, but don't watch it in the dark."
4,Psychological thriller!,This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
1,Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself,"Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."
1,Sorry Jim,"As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters."
1,harassing bears?,"Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins,"" by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?"
2,Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation,"You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century."
1,Don't buy,The box looked used and it is obviously not new. I have tried to contact them by email and no response. Don't buy from them!
1,Author has no creditability,"I have read ""In My Soul I Am Free"" that the author, Brad Steiger, wrote on the life of Paul Twitchell. The book on Twitchell was pure fiction and Steiger played the role of publicist. Twitchell fed Steiger fictional information that was never verified or researched by Steiger, and Steiger basically entered into a conspiracy with Twitchell to defraud the public. It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me. He has distorted the truth so much in the past that I don't see why the general public can trust anything or any subject coming from this author of fiction passing itself off as truth! There is a difference! Not everything is illusion! This is what the discerning mind is for... to discover your own Truth over the deceptions of others that would prevent you from discovering ITS value and worth."
3,Exámenes de práctica son así así,"First, I should say that I didn't actually use the book as a review, but my teacher did use two of the practice exams (not sure how many come with it in total) in class. We did one full length exam on a Saturday morning (I got a 5) and there was another one that we did in sections over a few days. This morning, I took the real College Board AP Spanish Language exam and it was a little different. Not completely different, mind you-REA got all of the basics right-but something about the tone and feel of the exam was different. The reading passages weren't actual narratives, but factual writings, two of them were reprinted from newspapers. On the listening section all of the accents in this book were from Spain (use of ""ceceo"") but none of them were on the actual test. This isn't a bad test, but some of the other review books are probably a little better. Again, I did not use this for review of grammar or look at the book at all, just the practice tests."
4,"great lil printer, BUT","I bought this to replace my original HP 4L Laser jet after 15 years. This seems to do a great job so far, much faster downloads and clean print,BUT BEWARE.... IT DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD TO CONNECT, so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter (as mine did) be ready to spend another $35.00 for a usb cord. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
5,Great Little Printer,"This little printer prints fast and clearly. I always thought a laser printer would be out of reach for me, cost-wise, but Amazon's price was quite reasonable (in fact it's still the lowest I've seen, a month later). Most of the things I print are in b&w anyway and I love not having to wait while my inkjet printer grinds out a page. I recommend this printer wholeheartedly."
3,Don't buy if you want to network this! Decent laser quality.,Found out too late that this printer is host based. That means it has to be connected to a computer to print.You cannot use a network print server (wired or wireless).This is from HP's tech support web site.
3,Linux Users Beware,"Linux users beware. This is not a standard HP laserjet. Cups drivers aren't yet available in most distributions which means no plug and play. If you are daring (or cheap) and you get this machine, I was able to use the information on this page to get it working in Ubuntu (which should match for all Debian based distributions):[...]Update: as of 2009, this printer works out of the box with Ubuntu without driver issues for me."
5,Perfect,"UPDATE:July 22, 2007: The old review stated that I have not changed my ink cartrdige, which was in August of 2005. I still have yet to change it. It has been almost 2 years. Since I am in school, I print hundreds to thousands of text. I am surprised that there is still no fade to the text. My printer has still not jammed and is still printing at quick speeds. I am fully satisfied with this printer and am glad I did not invest in any other printer. I recommend this printer to anyone that wants a cost efficient and very reliable, black and white printer.This HP Printer has lasted me throughout my freshman and sophomore year of college. I have not yet needed to change my ink cartridge: I've printed most likely 1000 pages of text. I've never had a hardware or software issues. When I recieved the product, there was no usb cable, as most printers do not include them (quite lame). I recommend this product to any person who does not need color. Great product and great price!"
2,not so good,"I used this printer for a year, it was working fine, and never got paper jam, and working fine with windows XP, and Vista. However margin is notperfect exact. every time when I print my document out margin is always littel different. I printed out same page 10 times every margin of paper is different. it was very annoying meMy toner was out last week, so I got the other printer --Brother HL-2070N Network Monochrome Laser Printer (Black)-- I think it is better than this one.it is five dollars cheaper than HP.and spec is higer than HP.brother HL-2070N VS HP1020Print speed: Up to 20 ppm VS 14 ppm A4-size(I used both printer and brother is faster than HP)150-sheetinput capacity : 250 sheet VS 150-sheetMemory: 16 MB VS 2 MBStandard interfaces: Hi-Speed USB 2.0, IEEE-1284 Parallel, 10/100 BaseT Ethernet VS Hi-Speed USB 2.0 portHp is little quite than brother. but it is not big deal for meor You can compare with the other printersbut in my case, the worst thing is the imprecise margin"
4,Very nice little laser printer,"This is a nice, compact laser printer. If you need something for routine B&W printing, this printer will do the job. I acquired it second hand from a friend, and it has worked really well. I bought an after-market toner from Amazon for $20.00 and it has already gone at least 500 pages. The quality is good for documents and emails, which is primarily what I use it for. It is not super quiet and it is not super fast, but I use it at home to print between 25 and 100 pages per week and it works very well!"
5,Best little printer ever!!!,"Would not sell for 300 even though bought for 80 because this printer is amazing! I have used for maybe 3 years and only replaced the ink cartridge once and print all the time. Quality Prints, Quiet and Nearly Instant prints. What else could you want?IFind one of these. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Not Mac Compatible, broke before printing a few thousand pages","This printer, though mostly functional when connected to a Windows box, did not work without significant amounts of effort when connected to a Mac. Customer support at HP was not helpful in resolving my Mac connectivity issues. I eventually got it working with some 3rd party tools, but then the printer power supply died. I called HP customer support again and was told to buy a new HP printer.Needless to say, this is the last HP printer I will own. I suggest looking at some of the Brother models instead."
2,Got Vista? Getting Vista? Forget HP 1020,"Worked great when I had XP. Now that I've upgraded to Vista, it's a $200 paperweight with collateral doorstop duties. No Vista driver, Bummer."
4,just got it,"nice printer, good DPI. doesn't have the bells and whistles of a more procy printer like color or automatic printing on both sides. It meets everything it claims though."
2,good printer WON'T LAST LONG - ugh,"Well after my printer almost lasted one year, and completely became useless just out of the warranty time...started searching the web for the 1020 support group.I see probably what we all see when our wonderful 1020 dies.Well, it doesn't DIE, it slowly comes apart, the piece of gray film, called TEFLON starts coming apart. Your printing will be sloppy, then your printer will start eating paper. Then you will look on here and see that you shouldhave bought the DELL monochrome, OR you SHOULD DEFINITELY BY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. Buttttt,,,,what is up with those laser cartridges. They do notlist any yield size. I'm not happy with HP right now, can you tell?"
4,Typical HP...,"Well made and nice text output. The only criticism I have of this printer is the paper tray. While these have a very small footprint, to load paper, you need to open the tray which sticks out and takes up more space the tray stays open as long as you need to print. Also the paper is exposed, so its subject to curling, fading, etc. Not big issues, but my personal preference is a drawer style. Overall a great printer. Got a great deal on it at Amazon."
4,HP LaserJet 1020 Printer,"This seems to be a pretty good printer so far. I have only had it a couple of weeks. The only complaint so far, is that it prints very slowly. But, what do you want for the price? All in all, I think it was a pretty good value for the money."
3,PRINTER,Just want to let you know that the product we received was not the reference we bought online We did not return this item because of the emergency and the need at the office.....Sorry but you should have more care regarding our request.
5,A great workhorse,"I couldn't be happier with this printer. I'm a writer and a writer who doesn't particularly like reading off a computer screen. I can't see the flow, and make easy notes, or get an overall vibe of the thing while reading off a screen.Plus, I'm also starting a PhD program in the next month and so printing is a necessity.I don't need the absolute fastest, and I don't need the absolute best quality. What I need is a solid, laser printer that fits into my decidedly narrow budget.This fit perfectly and it works perfectly as well.I'm very pleased."
2,No Vista Driver,"This is a very nice printer and a good upgrade from an inkjet printer. It is fast, quiet, and produces good results. However, it lacks a Vista driver so it no longer works with my upgraded Vista computer. HP is really dragging their feet on providing a driver."
2,Warning...Warning...Warning,"Much to my chagrin, my new HP s7320n desktop computer began locking up as soon as I connected this printer to it. After two working days of diagnostics, restarts, and even taking the computer back to where I bought it for an exchange, an arcane service bulletin said that this printer is not compatible with this computer.A sign of how far down HP has slid...an HP printer (which is otherwise a pretty good printer) that is not compatible with an HP computer.Seriously.So, before you buy one of these, make sure it will work with your HP computer..."
3,Not standard protocol.,"This printer uses a non-standard USB protocol that makes it a real pain to get to work on Linux. It also won't work on Windows XP or W2K with standard netprint boxes. I found this out too late. It does print nice if you connect directly to your Windows box. Unfortunately, my purpose in buying it in the first place was to have a cheap printer that I could hook to the wireless network router/print server."
1,HP has pulled 1022 driver from Website,"Yesterday, HP pulled the Mac OS X driver for the 1022 from its website, most likely because of Mac users buying 1020s and installing the driver to workaround it. I have not spoken to any HP people to confirm this, but I did download the driver on Tuesday, and after deleting it, found out I needed it again. Only today the driver is gone and the date the page was updated was May 18th! Nice job, HP!"
4,Great Little SOHO Printer,"We got this printer last year and have really liked it because it works pretty fast and we wanted something to print just text so we wouldn't have to keep replacing inkjet carts. We also got aNETGEAR PS121 USB 2.0 Mini Print Serverand it has all worked on our home network pretty well together, including with a PC that runs Win 98se (which had, much to my suprise, a usb port which was mandatory to set up the print server)."
5,I am so pleased with this computer.,"This is a great computer and at such a reasonable price. I haven't had any problems with it whatsoever. It's fast, doesn't jam and I print several pages everyday...unlike the ink-jets, I don't have to replace cartridges frequently.It arrived in a timely manner. I will shop here again."
4,HP Laser Jet 1020,"These laserjets are well designed, work well and are easy to use. (We use 5 of the similar 1012 model and they are good workhorses.The 1020's installation disk is great -- with good pictures, easy instructions that any normal person could follow. Much better than the manuals written in engineering language. HP should be complimented."
4,Great for printing checks,"Aside from being compact & 15ppm fast, the Hp 1020 printer does a great job of printing checks and deposit slips when used with any checkmaking software and a MICR toner cartridge from checksnet.Tried a few toner cartridges from several sources for my Hp 1020 and discovered that some MICR toner is not as dark, flakes off paper and my checks were unreadable when tested at bank. Went back to checksnet cartridges, everything fine again and better page yield."
5,I get a plenty of 'smooth use' out of this lit'l thing at my small business.,"I'll keep it simple...I get a lot of 'smooth use' out of this lit'l thing at my small business. Great, no me arrepiento (no regrets)! I wish I could find a laserjet 'all in one' in this 'price effectiveness' range as well."
5,The Printer that Could,"My first laser printer cost over $1,000, was frustratingly slow, and had good but not great print quality. Fifteen years and about as many printers later, I now have this little 1020 for less than one-fifth the price. I set it up in exactly two minutes. It runs dead quiet (nice in an office environment of so many fans and hums). It has great first page response - and when I'm done typing the letter, I slap the envelope in the manual tray, print it, and I'm done. The print quality is as good as it gets. It is not the fastest printer in the world, but it is more than competitive in this price bracket. And small? Smallest footprint of any laser I've owned, which is also important to me. I can't say enough about this printer - finally, someone got a small printer exactly right for small business."
4,Good Printer for the Price,The HP LaserJet 1020 did not dissapoint me. It is a good laser printer. I bought it for office tasks and it does a very good job. I only wish the package came with a USB cable it needs. It took some time for me to locate one.
5,Flawless,"This printer has been working flawlessly. This is the second one I have purchased. We decided to put one on each of our computers. No problems whatsover. If you want B&W laser prints without any problems, this printer is perfect and well priced."
4,Good for the task bought for,"I purchased this printer to replace a DeskJet in a dedicated application. The DeskJet was just too slow. I needed a small, low-power printer. This one fit the bill. Startup time is very quick. Printing speed is good and print quality (text only) is excellent."
3,Great home product,"This printer prints quickly, is quiet and would probably make an excellent home printer; BUT, it is one of the few HP laser printers that do not have PCL drivers, meaning it cannot print DOS based data. As it was not 'defective', we could not return it, so ended up paying for 2 printers to get one that would in an office environment."
3,Debs Printer,"Printer works great, good quality and economic. However, the paper cover tray was not included which I thought was part of the printer."
5,Wow fast delivery!,"Really nice printer, it's black and white ink, but does the job better than my higher quality printer,"
2,Dissatisfied with installation software,I was very dissatisfied that the HP LaserJet 1020 installation software did not provide acceptable printer drivers for Windows XP or Vista.
5,Great little machine!,"I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews, but I do appreciate reading them before I buy....so here's one for those considering buying this for their ""second office"" application. I've had this printer for 3 months now, and it's great for my home office (where I work when I'm not in my office office). Footprint is tiny, no problems with paper feed (like prior top-feed printers I've had), print quality good and crisp, and printouts appear instantly. Good work HP."
5,Great printer for the price,"I bought this printer to replace my HP Laserjet III, which was approximately 18 years old and only needed service once. The printer was delivered a few days earlier than I expected it. Even though the USB cable didn't come with it, I looked around at home and found that I had a spare one. I preloaded the software supplied with the printer and it was fully functional in under 15 minutes.I'm more than pleased with my selection. I hope this one lasts as long as the HP III did."
1,Spool crashes when printing PDFs,There is a known issue with this printer when printing PDFs. If you scan an image to a PDF and then attempt to print the PDF the printer spool crashes. Not only do you lose access to this printer but you also lose access to any other printer. The problem occurs with all Windows OSs but happens on a regular basis with Vista. Loaded several different print drivers recommended by HP but nothing worked. So proceed with caution.
5,Miracle Man,"This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It made Padre Pio very real, his life, dedication and suffering. It was a lengthy film but worth ever minute. I highly recommend it to any one at all intersted in the mystical side of our saints and the Church."
5,Inspirational,How one man's faith kept him through all of life's challenges. Very well played out and very well done!
5,Excellent Movie!,"Movie arrived on time and in great condition. This was a birthday gift for my grandaughter and she was really happy. I watched it and I just loved it, a great movie."
2,Great Saint - Movie a bit slow - drawn.,Indepth information about PadrePio - but the story could have been told in the usual 90 mins.This man suffered with the stigmata for 50 years ! Locution - Read hearts - Heard confessions for 18 or more hours a day - people waited days to have him hear (read their hearts) confession.
5,One of my all time favorites,"This is the kind of movie I like watching more than once. I have a deep admiration for this man who was able to follow Christ ways in such a heroic way, the movie does a great job also showing the issues within the church which true saints are able to endure and still love it.Very accurate in biographical data, I have to warn you that the dubbing in English (it lacks the proper feeling which can lead you to think that the acting was poor) is poor, the spanish one si really good.The music is beatiful.It's a work of art, highly reccomended, specially if you don't understand what a saint is and what are the merits that make one.The acting is really good, specially considering Father Pio had a complicated italian personallity :-)"
3,It was ALRIGHT.,"After reading other reviews before purchasing, and under the assumption, since it was close to 4 hours, this alotted time would highlight most of this saints miracles throughtout his time. If you are familiar with St.Padre Pio by word of mouth, or from a few pictures or articles, then you'll appreciate this film. However, if you are an advid reader of St. Padre Pio, you'll probally be disappointed as well.The reason for this is, besides receiving the stigmata and a few attacks of the devil, it fails to capture his incredible abilities, his healings, mystic visions, his interaction with guardian angels, bi- location, and levititation."
5,Padre Pio Miracle Man,This video was FANTASTIC. It was over 3 1/2 hrs and I was rivited. It is a great story and pretty close to article I have read about Padre Pio. Would recommend this highly.
5,Nothing short of incredible.,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Nothing else needs to be said, whoever watches it will understand."
2,B rated film,"This is a very, very long film, but poor performances make it longer. $24 is a lot to pay for an incomplete story line."
1,Pinnock the Quasi-Processist,"This book proves Mr. Pinnock, rather than dialoguing with Conservative, Evangelical Providence-Theists, is himself an extreme libertarian ultra-arminian attempting a synthesis & amalgamation with Processism in reaction to his perceived brand of hyper-calvinism (which few embrace and none of the authors who devastate free-willism like Millard Erickson).This is Quasi-Processism plain and simple.CHAFF OUTWEIGHS THE WHEATMORE STEAK SAUCE THAN MEAT"
3,Super Reader,"As you may guess from the title if you have an interest in Doc Savage, this one stars Doc Caliban and crew for the majority, as they fight their way through the schemes and obstancles of the evil dwarf supervillain.Wolves, a bear, and more. Doc's bear fighting approach is pretty novel, you would have to say. He ends up with a touch choice or two to have to make."
4,Golden Earring lead singer,"This is a pretty good early 70's album, although I give the nod to Barry's second solo album, ""Victory Of Bad Taste"", which is unfortunately very rare, as is George Kooyman's second solo album. My favorite track would definetely have to be ""Oh Lordy I'm Gonna Try"", least favorite would be ""Roll Another Rock"". If you liked ""Golden Earring"" (Wall Of Dolls), you'll probably like this."
4,Good introductory book,"A good introduction to Plone. But, there are a few typographical errors in code samples that will send you on minor troubleshooting trips. The author also covers some add-ins that cause errors when you try to remove them, again, causing you to do some troubleshooting. Not all bad. A little troubleshooting helps you learn the system."
1,"Not recommended, maybe six pages of useful info","This book has maybe six pages of useful info. It tells how to make a custom portlet.Much of what it describes is obvious from looking at the Plone interface. Moreover, I suspect that the author may not know Plone or Zope very well.Save your money. The other Plone books are better."
2,Outdated and misleading code examples,"If you are a designer who wants to know how to customize Plone's look beyond changing colors and fonts, you'll be disappointed in this book. Sure, the introduction is still good, but chapter 6 (for example), which instructs you to work with the Plone Base Properties file is giving you an outdated method, not well suited to upgrades and maintenance. I believe that stylesheets are the way to go, now...but I'm still trying to figure it out, no thanks to this book. The instructions for adding slots in Chapter 5 were just impossible to follow and did not even vaguely work. Yes, the text is in English, but the descriptions bear little resemblence to the Plone 2.1+ experience.This book will, however, give a somewhat glossy overview of the entire application. I would get a recent version of Andy McKay's book, and look elsewhere for customization help."
5,Great story,This novel was a very quick read. The characters were well developed and so was the story line. I loved the way it ended it gave the story a close. I recommend this novel to anyone.
5,"Drama, Drama and more Drama","This book is a page turner. It will have you guessing about the ending. I wonder who did Ms. Spencer get the male outlook from, but whoever it is is real. The ending is a shocker, but so is the middle and the beginning. It will keep you laughing."
3,The Lone Star Reader,"This book was not an easy read for me. Upon purchasing this book I tried several times to read it and the book did not hold my interest. One night, I looked at my bookshelf and realized that this was the only book I had not completed and I decided to make myself finish this book. Once I passed the first few chapters the book became interesting. This book is Texas based, so I could identify with several of the places in the story and this made me want to continue reading it. In the end it turned out to be a cute story, similar to some of Eric Jerome Dickey's work. It was also similar to the book ""One woman short"". It's not a book that I would ever read again, so I would suggest that you check it out at a library and read it before you buy it. I'll probably be selling my copy on Amazon soon...."
4,ENJOYABLE BUT VERY PREDICTABLE!,"I enjoyed the book, however, at times, I thought it was slow and very predictable. Sometimes it felt as if the author was dragging the storyline out to add length to the book. On the other hand, it was an easy enjoyable read."
5,Strange Exciting Twist,WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE is a fantastic book to read on a slow Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed it because I could never have anticipated the twist and turns the story takes. I think Ms. Spencer is on her way to becoming a very popular writer.
5,Out of sight!!!!,"An excellent book of ""Cat and Mouse"" (so to speak). I thought this was an excellent book. It was easy reading, interest....A real page turner with a twist."
3,Did I Miss Something?,"I feel like I've missed something since most people gave this book 4 or 5 stars but it wasn't anything special to me. The book was a fast paced, easy-to-read book but the plot just did not grab me at all. I bought this book because I was told how great it was but, after I was finished reading it, I felt like I read a different book than my friends. My major problem with the book, and thus the 3 star rating, was the plot was just too predictable. I felt like the book took way too long to get to the conclusion I could see coming after about the first 30 to 40 pages. I think Camika Spencer has a lot of potential, though, so I would definitely try another book of hers in the future."
4,Didn't You Know?,"This book was great, but any person with a bit of perception could see where it was going. Don't get me wrong, that didn't take from it. Sister got skills. I'm talking about the author, here. Mad props are sent to Camika for such a suspense filled book."
3,Soul Shocking,"This was a very good book, but long and a bit drawn out, I believe that Greg needed to get over some of the issues with him mother earlier on, but that is usually the reality of things. I also found it hard to believe that his sister was so naive. Overall I would read her again."
5,Dont Stop Now.......,This was a very exciting book. I finished it in 2 days. I cant wait for the next book.
3,I WAS A BIT LETDOWN,BASED ON THE REVIEWS I EXPECTED A MORE SCANDALOUS SECRET. I kept turning pages hoping to get to the good parts. I did find it funny at times. I think there's some good stories in this author head. I'll give her another try.
4,I went to school with the author,"Camika was always serious at ETSU, so to see her actually write a book with humor almost sent me to my grave. I enjoyed the book and it's good to finally see the author relax and live a little. I never thought she'd be an author either. All she ever did that made her smile was play Spades. The book was all that and I'm really just glad to know that I know someone who is taking the bull by the horns and following her dream. Hey Camika, remember that water gun fight with the Omegas and the time we kidnapped the guy we thought was on line for Alpha? Those were the days. I'm a supporter for life! Oo-oop!"
1,How dare you speak of Jarvis Christian College that way..,"I was shocked and when I read this book. I went out and purchased it because I support black authors. When I found out she was my sorority sister, I was sick to my stomach. How dare she put down Jarvis Christian College, an historically black college that you she has never attended. You made my alma mater look as if the degree i received from there is worthless. I have a very successful life as do other JCC alumnus. It is up to our black authors to protray us in a positve light not degrade us. Before she writes another book she needs to get her informations researched thoroughly. Just in case Ms. Spencer reads this I can be reached at delta4620@yahoo.com"
4,"Overall, it Was Enjoyable","For a first effort, I found this book to be well-detailed in creating imagery and character development. Although Shreese's situation with Reverend and Adrian's scandal were easy to predict, Ms. Spencer does a good job with this one...I felt like I was in a jazz club when reading the scenes between Greg's parents. There was some good research put into making that jazz come to life. And for those who felt that Afro-Americans were being insulted and stereotyped, lighten up...It's only fiction! You know, creations from the imagination..."
2,Slightly Disappointing,I found that story line too predictable. I felt that the author made the female characters in the novel nothing but ...air heads. She made no effort to prove that a woman does not need a man to complete her as a person. I am just very disappointed that a sistah feels so lowly of her own kind.
2,Too much hype....,"After reading many(good)reviews for this book, I decided to check it out at the library. I think the book was overrated. There were some good moments, but it seemed like the book was put together over night."
5,couldn't stop reading,"Well my bookclub enjoyed every page of this book she was a new author for us and we got our money worth. Boy Adrian was something else but we knew something wasn't right about her and to do a man like that you are what you are and she didn't have to bring Greg into her life like that, but his mother was a for real women and I'm glad the sister got her head on straight. You will enjoy this book I passed it on and everyone say the same thing I couldn't stop reading."
3,Needs fine tuning,"This book was okay. I wasn't as explosive as the good reviews nor as horrible as the bad reviews. I think that her writing could use a little fine tuning. (Just a thought, you should take a look before offending people in your audience) I have to agree with some or the outrages from the beauticians and small town college graduates. Hopefully, when she does novel #2, she should slow down and think"
3,Pretty Good....,I read this entire book in one sitting...as usual. Though the book was an easy read that held my attention... I didn't walk away with anything. When I closed the cover at the end... it was like I had hadn't read a thing! I suggest checking this book out from the library... and not spending any money on it. One big plus... the ending was hilarious...though kinda predictable!
3,when All hell Breaks Loose!,"This book was ok, to be her first novel. I felt she could came up with a better story line. Hopefully her second novel will be better!"
5,"It may have been predictable, but I couldn't put it down","I dont care what was wrong with this book. If I couldn't put it down then that says a lot! I read the other reviews where people were disappointed and all that, but it takes work and commitment to even write a paragraph let alone a book. Camika, don't let those other comments hinder you because I've yet to read their work. YOur book did have flaws but who's book doesn't? All I can say is the book grabbed my attention and I had to finish it no matter what. That's the definition of a good book. I don't like sappy endings either and yours allowed me to come up with my own conclusions. I'm sure Random House is helping you with everything else. I'm forever in your corner because you've done what most of us only dream about."
5,"I laughed, got mad, cried and even screamed.",This book was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I bought it and read it in 3 days. By the time I finished I was breathing hard and mad at Adrian. She knew better. Maybe she didn't. I need a sequel!
1,Poorly written and insulting,"Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"
2,Hell didn't break loose- it barely struck a match!,"It took exactly 100 pages for this book to even begin to be interesting! Ms. Spencer had a tendency to go on and on spatting what seemed to be her own opinions, and voicing them through Greg, her main character. While this can be good, her voice should not smother that of her characters. I thought Shreese's character was too the extreme. She just seemed like a stereotype. It was not until further into the book that you can see she is a true person rather than a stock character. It was a slow read that did not pick up until page 100!! From then on, I was just waiting for something to happen. The climax was smooth and well written, and the book closes giving you, the reader a sense of closure as well. It was refreshing since the beginning was so stale! Spencer used stereotypes instead of modeling her characters after real people. It is almost as though this book was written by two different people. This book should have gone unpublished."
3,Originality?,The book had mixed reviews but I gave it an average rating. I was just not moved by this book. This was the author's first book so I'll give her props for that. Her character development (Adrian) could have been better. What I did enjoy was how the author wrote from a male's persepective. I will look forward to reading her next book.
2,I'm sorry...but this one wasn't all of that for me!,"I usually don't give bad reviews but I must make an exception. I purchased the book sometime last year, and have struggled to finish it after pickin it up and putting it down a couple of times.After seeing all of the ""glorious"" reviews I decided to give it another try and FINISH IT! I must say that I was truly disappointed. I am sure Ms. Spencer's next book will be ""da bomb"" but this was a dud for me.It was tooooooooooooo slow - and it was sooooooooooo predictable. I mean I figured out the book's ending in the first portion of the book but it took Ms. Spencer 200 pages to finally get to the end of the story.I'm sorry...I just was expecting a lot MORE based on all of the reviews that I read. But then again...who am I to judge!Try it you might like it!"
2,Not much enthused...,When All Hell Breaks Loose was a great disappointment. I thought the story was building up to be something more. I knew what the ending was going to bring before I got there and it was anticlimatic. I didn't like the synopsis of all the characters at the end. Ms. Spencer didn't make me really like and grow attached to any of the characters and I couldn't care less what happened to them. All the male/female bashing and hatred was disheartening.
2,Wasn't all that great.,"After reading all of the reviews for this book, I thought it would be pretty good. However, I found it to be predictable. The story-line seemed be dragging at several points in the book and I just wasn't buying THE REASON for Adrian's betrayal- it seemed unrealistic."
3,Well......,"It was okay. It had its moments. His friends were jerks who couldn't buy a clue. His mother had her reasons for leaving her family, which his father understood, but somebody should have clued the kids in a long time ago. Their lives may have taken a different direction. As for the girlfriend? Please. She couldn't be honest with herself, how could she be honest with him? It was an okay book. I think I would have like it better wiithout a couple of his jerk friends. It made you wonder why he was even friends with them. Of course, I haven't told anyone they just HAD to run out and get it. I wished I had borrowed it rather than bought it."
4,When All Hell Breaks Loose,"This is a wonderful first effort from Camika Spencer. Drama, however, is a perfect word to describe it. I thought the ideas were set on a great stage of characters, personalities and situations. We were able to follow our main character (Greg) throughout some very difficult and stressful times in his life. I absolutely love the interaction between Greg, his friends, his family, and his coworkers. The character development was absolutely great. There weren't too many that we were confused of who was who or what aura they possessed. I was quite pleased with the book. It was a fairly easy read and there was just enough suspense to keep you looking for the plot and the outcome. Personally, I was pleased to be able to follow Greg as he matured in this situation. I would much rather find my characters changed and mature at the end of a novel, than falling into the same scenarios. Ms. Spencer has done an excellent job with her premier novel. I look forward to more of her work."
3,What a hard Pill to Swallow !,"Sometimes bad things do happen to really good people ! Such was the case of Greg, his siter and father . Greg was hopeful Adrian was the one for him! How could he compete ? You could certainly feel the love he shared with her ! What a shame to hurt a guy in this way ! Why couldn't Adrian just be true to herself and be upfront with Greg. She was entitled to live her life but not hurt another in the process ! Sherese( his sister ) on the other hand learned a hard lesson in life. A man is a man! Even if he is a so called man of God ! I was so glad their Dad regained the love of his life ! I guess sometimes you have to follow your dream which was the case of his Mom , but her heart was still there ?"
2,Fiction and fabricated lies,This book was poorly written and contained information that was purely insulting. Women with perms are not natural and small black colleges produce mediocre people. Black women should uplift their people. We get knocked down enough already.
3,"Revisit the past with ""Lilies of the Field""","Nice story about a traveling handyman who is befriended by some German-speaking nuns. My favorite scene shows Sidney Poitier teaching the Nuns the spiritual ""Amen."""
2,Not my favorite Poitier film,"I think the point of this film is about faith. Everyone likes a good miracle movie. Right? Well, not quite. There was plenty of cringe worthy moments regarding race. Mr. Ashton calling Homer 'boy' and then telling the nuns that Smith was lazy and shiftless-but still wanted him to work for him. (Weird.) I hated the scenes where he was just shuffling to please them. And I didn't understand why Mother Maria simply couldn't say 'Thank You' especially when she was begging for everything. Out of all the good roles Poitier has played, they give him the Oscar for when he played a good field slave doing what he was told. Whatever."
3,Lilies of the Field,"I am not really a fan of Sidney Poitier ( this was purchased as a gift for my step father and he is a fan, state the movie was very good ) will borrow his one day and watch it, right now all I can do is rate it for him."
1,order cancelled by store,"ordered this DVD for the holidays. Purchase was confirmed. After received 4 emails that the DVD would be shipped shortly, the company cancelled the order stating they did not have the item."
5,Poitier's best,"""Lilies of the Field"" is a great movie. Even though it's in black and white, this movie puts the viewer right in the action. If you've attended Catholic school, you can really identify with the toughness of the German nuns. All characters are believable, and the acting is first rate. I heartily recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Classic,"This is one of those movies every movie buff should see at least once. This is a feel good movie to watch when you feel life is being too tough on you. I always liked this movie, but it is surprisingly realistic since I met Helga, a 79yo Berliner visiting the States. Mother Superior is NO caricature, they really do come that way."
5,Amazon order,"Would buy again from this seller. Item arrived quickly, and in condition described.Thanks so much!"
5,A Heart-Tugging Look at the Value of One Man at Work,"A great movie. I don't understand why they don't show it more often. Sidney Poitier's character in this movie harkens back to his performance in ""To Sir with Love."" Also gives a nostalgic look at the American West. If you don't buy this excellent movie, make sure to rent it sometime. You'll enjoy it!"
5,A really good movie,"This is a classic, great movie. It's one that is watchable on a repeat basis. Low key but very meaningful. The movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the H. Bogart movies 'Casablanca' and 'Sahara' effectively use that medium.The price is right. It's a keeper. Buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance."
3,Not yet been able to view this movie! Only received in mid-Jan. 2013 from overseas via Rarewaves. Does not function on US DVD!,"This purchased DVD from your contracted overseas subsidiary, Rarewaves, is for Region 2: Europe. Not Region 1: USA.This DVD does not work on any standard DVD player in the U.S. or Canada."
5,Lighthearted Comdey,Good movie with comedy thats subtle and not forced or over the top like modern movies. I know most people will not focus on the humor of this movie but it's what I like about it.
4,Pretty Toney Album,"I bought that Ghost face Album a month ago and in all actuallity that is one of the best album I've got in a while. From the intro it was tight, I'm a fan of the wu no matter what people say about them. I respect those who don't bend to trends, be leaders not followers. Toney does his thing on this one with lines like"" I keep Big Shurly on my side so what's happen. Get the he'll out of here what other dude would say some ish like that. The album touch mad topic from love to runnin' from them folks. In closing all I got to say is to all those that hold the wu down keep doing it, true Mcin' is over here."
2,WHAT!!!,"Don't buy it. If Meth's new album isn't at least ten times better than this, then rap is officially dead, and the only thing that can resurrect it is a Bone Thugs reunion."
1,This album sucks,All I can say is this album sucks bad!! Ghostface Killah really sucks now and his lyrics are made for ignorant black people who don't know any better.. I threw this CD out my window it sucked so bad! disgrace to music
4,Real Kids Spit That Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!,"First of all I really would like to give this a 4.5, but of course that's not possible. Ghostface hits us with another dope album, probobly his most solo album yet. There are no Wu-Tang guest appearances, but Rza produces a couple tracks. This album is really soulful, the background vocals and the beats just have that old school feel, which I like. My favorite tracks are Biscuits feat. Trife, Beat The Clock, Metal Lungies feat. Sheek & Styles, It's Over, Holla, Ghostface, Run feat. Jadakiss, and Love feat. Musiq & K. Fox. The other tracks are good, there's no wack stuff on this album. The most important thing about this CD is that it's real Hip-Hop music which I feel is coming back in a big way. If you're a fan of Ghostface or Wu-Tang you should definitley cop this. Don't be fooled by the single Tush with Missy, this isn't a party album, it's a Hip-Hop album."
4,Very well done,Let me just say that this is the best cd i have heard in a while. I still love the Wu but here lately it seems that their albums have not been up to par with what i expect from them. But as always Ghost pulls through and makes another great album. I love the b-sides and the best song has to be holla (I think ghost should release it as a single b/c it has a whole new style that many haven't heard before trust me it could be huge).
4,Pretty Toney,This album is great! One thing I dont like is that RZA only produced 2 tracks.1:Intro 3/52:Biscuits 5/53:Kunta Fly S**t 4/54:Beat the clock 4/55:Metal Lungies 4/56:Bathtub (Skit) 2/57:Save Me Dear 5/58:Its over 3/59:Keisha's House (skit) 4/510:Tush 5/511:Last Night (skit) 5/512:Holla 5/513:Ghostface 5/514:Be This Way 3/515:The Letter (skit) 2/516:Tooken Back 3/517:Run 5/518:Love 4/5This album is really good. The skits might throw you off a bit. Go out and get it!
4,the realist,ghostface came with his 4th album different because to him the every rapper in the rap game was doing the same thing this album isnt as good as his first 3 albums but it was something new and thats a good thing.
4,Its good,If u are lookin for a good album with some soul into it this is the album to go get. I just bought this album and i only found a few songs that didnt suit me. But I think the following tracks are his best...2. Biscuits 5/54. Beat The Clock 4/55. Metal Lungies 5/513. Ghostface 3/514. Be This Way 4/515. Tooken Back 4/517. Run 5/5
4,I am in love with Hip Hop again..,"Everytime Ghost releases an album I fall in love with hip-hop all over again. All of his albums top my list of favorite Hip-Hop/Rap albums of all time. It really makes me sad when I see a top ten list and he isn't on it. He is truly underated. This is the only full album that I have brought all year, that is because Ghost's songs flow like one choesive journy through his mind rather then a collection of wannabe club bangas, and as always his beats are beautiful."
1,Pretty Toney,Unfortunately or on Purpose!!! this album was released 2 weeks ago on the Net...and I had a chance to preview it - there a handful of solid tracks but as a referral the better album is Pretty Toney - The B-Sides...every track is a hit...I dont know why Def Jam did not want to buy those songs the lyrics and production are amazing...peace.
3,"No, No,NO!!!","This album is not good at all. It just not good. For his first DEF JAM release, what a bad freshman year. Don't get me wrong, the album has its shining moments in the sun, but it is not up for consideration to be compare to his previous efforts. 3 stars max.Top 3 Songs: Run, Metal Lungies, Kunita Fly S***Bottom 3 Songs; Ghostface, Holla, Be This WaySleeper: Biscuits"
3,Pretty Toney Album (3.5 Stars),"Oh boy, another wutang album hits stores. Even though I have always been suspicious of wutang solo albums ever since the massive failures that followed Raekwon's solo, i always take a look at the albums for fun. As far as mainstream goes these days, this album wasnt too bad compared to Methodman's latest and Ghost's 2001 ""Bulletproof Wallets"". Thouh he lacks the usual raekwon colllabo. and a variety of topics in his songs, this album is decent, but dont pay more than 10 bux for it as im sure your local record store will probably have a few used ones after awhile."
3,"Good Album, But average from Ghostface.","Pretty Toney Album is Ghostface's first album since dropping the ""Killah."" It is appropriate that he did so, because his lyrics and sound are slightly less murderous. Fans of classic Ghostface Killah, such as myself, might find this album a little too mainstreamy for their taste. Songs like ""Tush"" w/ Missy Elliot, and ""Ghostface,"" are strictly clubbin' songs with bland lyrics. The Pretty Toney Album does have its gems, though. ""Be This Way,"" which Ghostface describes as ""real gangsta shxt,"" is the strongest, most classic song on the album. ""Metal Lungies"" w/ Styles P. and Sheek Louch is another standout track. Sheek Louch and Ghostface both rip rap a new one. Fans of Ghostface Killah buy all of his albums, and they should. Ghostface has one of the most ""pretty toney"" sounds in the rap game, but don't expect a ""Supreme Clientelle"""
4,this album is nice...,"Ghostface's new album isn't as good as Supreme Clientele, but it definitely is a hot CD...the last track with musiq called 'love' is nice, and obviously ghost and jada's ""RUN!"" is sick...there's only 1 song i truly hate on the CD and its the one with a beat with a telephone ringing, it just gets on my nerves...otherwise in my opinion its a pretty hot CD, but not as good as some of Ghost's other albums.."
4,Old-school Productions + Same Classic Ghostface Style,"Wow, having just listened to this album in full, I have to say that I wasn't dissappointed at all. The production is fire, Ghostface's lyrics are fire (as always), and the cameo's on this album just add to its greatness.Stand Out Tracks:02. Beat the Clock05. Metal Lungies08. It's Over12. HollaThe only track that I didn't like was #13 Ghostface. It didn't fit this album at all.This album minus the tracks Ghostface and Push = 5 stars."
4,Ghostface's best album,"I must admit, the wu tang member and solo rapper, Ghostface is one of the most talented rappers in the world, this album is getting Killah to the top of the game with amazing lyrics, hot beats and excellent collaberations. Rumors on his next album, said to be produced by Public Enemy leader, Chuck D, will be featuring major collaberations with Outkast, Ludacris, Janet Jackson, WC and a final reunion with Wu Tang. Other than that, this album has memroble tracks like 'Run', 'Holla' and 'Tush'. 'Pretty Toney Album' is ok for the established rap star, but there's more to come."
5,Ghost is Back,"Ghostface a.k.a Tony Starks a.k.a Pretty Tony a.k.a Ironman is back. Although he is with Def Jam now his style has not changed. He is still the real MC we all have come to know and luv. This is real hiphop right here, not your everyday average, Ice and bling type rap CD. All the beats are bangers (a 70's type feel) and the lyrics are straight fire from start to finish. This needs to be in heavy rotation this summer, since alot of people slept on BULLET PROOF WALLETS (another Ghostface album).Wake up cause real hiphop can not be denied.Put away your Nelly, Chingy, and CashMoney CD for a second and listen to this joint.Instant classic right along with Supreme Clientele (another hot Ghostface album)Since the face been revealed game got real for real"
4,It's nice to see hip hop back.,"From the first track, I was hooked. I knew I was getting that classic Wu-Tang. Ghostface has been the number one Wu member for a long time and that doesn't change with this cd (even though Masta Killa is making a hell of a come up). I got this cd last week and haven't stopped listening to it. Ghostface spits that hellfire and brimstone raps like it's nothing and his production, even though it's not tight on some tracks, it's still solid and good enough to spend you $11, $12. With the help of a few more Wu members, he makes us realize why we were wu-tang fans to begin and why 1993 was the happiest year of our lives. Get this and Masta Killa's new joint too to add to the Wu collection. But by all means, avoid Meth's new joint and avoid his tv show, as it looks like one of the stupidest things I've ever seen."
5,Classic Hip Hop in 2004!!,"I'm been rocking this one heavy rotation since it dropped.La, La, La, Holla- if you hear me!!!!Holla is one of my favorites, so are Beat the Clock, Biscuits,It's Over, & Be This Way. I really like it all except Missy's verse on Tush (just hit skip after Ghosts 2 verses)."
4,Dont know what that fool is talkin bout,"Whoever this cat is from indonesia needs to shut his mouth, or chop his fingers off. This album is if not good is great. You can be mad for the new meth album but dont start dissin wu tang. This kid obviously knows nothin about hip hop and the english language. Wu tang still rules forever."
5,The Ironman of Hip Hop!,"This album is the defifnition of a classic. All the elements are there. Tight beats, tight lyrics this is an excellent product. Ghost has elevated the game. Others rappers need to take notes. Get this joint!"
5,Ghostface is the most consistent in the game.,Another hot one from the most consistent man in the Wu. Damn that! One of the most consistent in hip-hop period. Hasn't disappointed yet. And this is hip-hop you can feel. Not this old manufractured crap you see all over MTV every five minutes. Ya'll aint ready for Ghost. Keep it up man and tell the rest of the Wu to step it up. I still got love for them.Wu-Tang Forever babythetza
1,Warning,"The music on this CD is great. My comments have to do with the way in which Amazon describes the product. This is a CDR, without any liner notes and the track listing basically copied from the web site. But you will not learn this by looking at the Product Details. You will find this information under Editorial Reviews, where it says: This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.While this information would have been better placed under Product Details no where does it tell you that you will not receive the liner notes.Amazon is misrepresenting the product. I hope my short review will help others who are considering purchasing the CD."
5,Classic example of the genre,"I would have to agree with the other review in that this nearly 45 minute performance is flawless for the genre. No audience noises or any indication that it's live... which ranks it up there with any studio output from Main. Beautiful sounds that do more than drone, they lift you. The recording has many layers of guitar sounds that are typical of Main's output of treated guitar for gentle outer space travel. Excellent recording quality too. If you're thinking about getting this one, don't wait as they are out of print and supply is very low!"
4,My Son loves it,"Nevertheless my Son don't speak English (yet), he loves to watch his Thomas & Friends DVDs, of course he has his favorites, like Thomas on site with friends (the one he watch the most) and Thomas and his trusties Friends; this collection fulfill our expectations and gives our Son hours of fun... but we let him watch 30 to 45 minutes a day, the rest of the afternoon he play away of the TV screen, and guess with what... yup, his Thomas and friends Take along toys within others."
3,Arise,"This album has some great sound and some excellent beats, the Abssinians definitely add to the tradition of quality reggae music. My complaints were that their focus was highly religious, rather than reggae's usually more socially conscious themes. Their sound is also slightly more polished or synthetic than many, in my opinion. A decent album, but not the best."
1,Design flaw prevents easy installation,"For a 1/2"" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2"" copper pipes longer than about 1"" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4"" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort."
3,it works kinda cheap quality,Looks good on the outside but it really cheap in quality - looks like an apartment fixture all plastic on the inside where it diverts the water - spend bit more for a better quality fixture
4,The American Frugal Housewife,I found this book to be very entertaining. We are so used to our creature comforts that we really don't realize how much work daily life was in the 1800s.
4,Love old recipes,"thanks for compiling these recipes. They were fun to read, and although I am certain that I am not going to make any of them, it was fun reading them."
4,a fun book,"This was a quick and enjoyable read for me on the Kindle. I loved reading about keeping house in the 19th century. It's amazing how far we've come, and yet what was relevant and useful then is still so today. I did pick up some tips, but mainly I just came away with a deeper respect for my great-grandmothers and all the women before them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hug my fridge, washing machine, and microwave now!"
4,great ideas,I love the way this was written. I could just picture a no nonsense pioneer housewife. Not everything would pertain to the modern day but still very good.
5,Great book,This book was in excellent condition. I love it. It is a little bit of history with good ideas for today.
4,Fascinating Look into the Past,"I purchased this book for the Amazon Kindle app on my phone and it's suitable for intermittent short-term reading.This book is written in a very interesting voice: plainspoken but engaging. From the standpoint of a wife and mother who works full-time outside the home, it seems women have always been busybusybusy and the only things that've changed are (some of) the things we're busy at and how we have to get them done.I find myself having to investigate certain words or phrases that've gone out of date, but that's easy with this app's features."
5,Common sense from years ago,"It is not a book, as such, just several wonderful hints that are great to see in this day and time."
3,I really wanted to read this book,"I really wanted to read this book, it is one I have looked forward to reading on the new Kindle Fire with Amazon Prime, too, that my children gave me for this past Christmas (2012). BUT, since, even WITH Amazon Prime, I was told by Amazon customer service that I am only allowed one FREE download book and ONE PER MONTH on the book from the LENDING LIBRARY per MONTH. I read Moby Dick in one sitting.Wish I could have read it. Sad that Amazon sold me and my children a bill of goods. So when I wanted to return the Kindle Fire, I found out that I would be charge a fee of 30 (thirty) PERCENT of the value of my Kindle Fire and forget about returning the leather cover. Not a chance of returning that leather cover."
1,Useful 50 years ago,"But few of the ideas are practical in today's world. I suppose if you lived on a homestead with few amenities you might be able to glean some usefulness from this book. But as a modern dweller, I was disappointed."
2,Bronze,"I was not pleased, there were glue stains and rhinestones missing, but because I was pressed for time I had no choice but to keep them (they were to wear at my daughter's wedding."
5,"An excellent movie, deserves to be better known","It just needs to be said that the movie is what you could expect of having a master, Hopper, playing a character by another, Highsmith, while directed by yet another, Wenders. If you already read Ripley's game, see the movie to find an amazing picture of that odd world depicted by Patricia Highsmith."
2,1906 edition,"This is a reprint of the 1906 edition. Linotype and monotype were recent technological innovations. The Helvetica typeface was 50 years in the future. No one had yet thought of using endnotes rather than footnotes. A hyphen is recommended in cases such as: ice-cream, wave-length, common-sense, fountain-head, and view-point.A mildly amusing antique, but not useful for anyone actually doing writing, editing, or publishing."
2,This is NOT the current edition !!!!,"Well, who'da thought it? Bought this, thinking it was somewhat akin to the current edition and what to my surprise, it is the 1906 version and it isn't worth BEANS. What a waste of time and money.Now the current version of this book would be a good addition to anyone's library."
1,Hopelessly out of date,"The Chicago Manual of Style has become the standard for professional writers and publications in many different fields. But this ""1st Edition"" is hopelessly of date. It's okay for historical purposes but so much of the English language and syntax has changed over the years that an up-to-date edition would be much more valuable, even if the price is higher.Russ Heitz[...]"
4,Questions looking for answers,"I really enjoy the trigun series, and i am thinking of buying the soundtrack. I am curious though, i really want the tune that shows up in nearly every episode. The calm tune that sounds like a flute. I don't know its title or anything, but if you know what I am talking about, could you give me some info on it. thanks. [...]"
1,Warning: Clip Job - Search out the Original,"The other user comments are technically correct. The film is great... in its original version. ""Deadly China Hero,"" however, is a clipped version of the film ""Last Hero of China."" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version."
1,You don't want this version!,"When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting ""customers""(read victims)."
5,Chopped Version of Last Hero In China,"I agree with Michael Van about the clipped version "" Deadly China Hero"" as I own ""Last Hero in China"" which is the movie in its orginal presentation and with Subtitles. This is actually, if placed in order of sequences by year, the Fourth ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series before OUATIC IV/V came out. Nonetheless, you have to watch this movie as it has, as usual, great martial art scenes. I own all but OUATIC IV and most of Jet Li's DVD's that are available. The 6th version of OUATIC is ""Once upon a Time in China and America"" also starring Jet Li. Though this may be the 4th Jet Li did as Wong Fei-Hung, you do not have to see the three previous OUATIC's. Order is not important with this version of Wong Fei-Hung but the tales of this Martial Artist (a real actual Chinese Hero) is. Get this DVD and try to get ""Last Hero in China"" also. In fact, get every Jet Li movie made. You will not be dissappointed. This man is our replacement for Bruce Lee."
4,What?????,"This was such an awesome movie.Remove everything you ever knew about the Once upon a time in china series from your head, except for Jet Li playing the serious Wong fei-hung. Then make this movie one of the craziest and funniest movies ever and stick Wong fei-hung in the middle of it. What you have is a very enjoyable movie. And as much as I did like it, the music was the best part for me. For those of you that know the OUATIC series, you know Tsui Hark was the first ones to put lyrics in a movie to the Wong fei-hung theme song. Well then Jing Wong was the second. Great Soundtrack.All you people trying to stick through it all the way, please wait until the end fight."
1,Last Hero in China - 5 stars / Deadly China Hero - no stars!,"Deadly China Hero is a poorly edited version of the original Last Hero in China. I'm glad so many people like it but it lacks about 15 minutes of the original movie and they are the minutes that make it a cohesive movie instead of a jumble of martial arts fights. This taking of a classic martial arts movie, chopping it up, and then releasing it under a different name has got to stop! People deserve the chance to see the original movies!"
4,Fast-paced kung-fu versus convoluted story,"Anyone who is a Jet Li fan will indeed appreciate the kung-fu sequences in this movie... especially the last one where Li makes his own deadly amalgamation of the Drunken Fist and Shaolin five Fist styles... the result is a superb ending fight! The story is long and irrelevant at parts, but comprehensible. Here's some insight... anything Yuen Woo Ping (renowned director and martial arts choreographer) touches is a classic... Wu Tang Master, Fist Of Legend, Drunken Master... need I say more! Also, the chicken/centipede dance was ridiculous yet amusing.... Purchase!"
2,Last and The Least,"I bought this film on a whim, since the store I went to didn't have 'exactly' what I wanted (OUATIC 2 fer sure)SO I figured I'd watch the last in the series since OUATIC and America was a HUGE disappointment for me. I have yet to make up my mind on Jet Li films. And this put me in the negative state (again) The story was slow and unmoving, the characters were not interesting, the fighting was sparse (why else get a kung fu film?)and the last fight with Jet in a chicken suit (JET LI IN A CHICKEN SUIT!!!!!)was the last straw. I'm sorry, but if Fist Of Legend was his best, then this must have been by far his worst. ""I wouldn't buy this DVD with YOUR money!!!"""
3,"Okay Karate action, but can be better!","This movie needs to learn from a classic movie like Enter The Dragon and Missin In Action! Hong Kong movies have bad Karate in it, most of it is not even Karate! Trust me, I'm a second degree black belt so I know what i'm talking about."
3,Nice Chicken outfit,"Originally titled ""The Last Hero in Chine."" A nice twist on the Wong Fei Hong storyline, with Master Wong moving his martial arts studio, unbeknownst to him, next to a brothel. The righteous master can't have that, but it turns out the brothel helps him defeat the baddies. A ridiculous display of Jet Li fighting in a chicken outfit is quickly made up for with a brilliant display of drunken boxing. Jet Li is his usual charismatic self, and Yuen Woo Ping can be counted on to deliver every time..."
4,Deadly Chinese Hero,"It is a good movie, but if you already have Last Hero in China, you already have this movie, why they have the same movie with two different names, I don't know."
2,"Ouch, this is painful to watch...","I love some of Jet Li's work (esp. in LW4), but this movie was just terrible. Way too much wire-fu, the plot was unintelligible and it seemed like the whole film was in fast forward. The only saving grace was the horrible job of translating on the subtitles. Example: when one character means to say ""I have to go the bathroom"" he instead says ""I want pissing."" Without that it wouldn't have been funny at all."
3,jet li as wong fei hong again,"though not as good as the once upon a time series, it's still a pretty good movie, because it throughs humor into the mix. if you've seen deadly china hero it basically the same but last hero in china has 1 or 2 extra scenes, but it's something you really don't notice because it doesn't effect the plot of the movie. They even have one of my all time favorites Gordon Lui(he's a bad guy this time though) i recommend this version on dvd for two reasons first it's Jet Li, so you know you're getting great fight scenes, (even though his drunken boxing wasn't as good as when Jackie Chan played Wong Fei Hong in Drunken Master 2) and secondly because the Deadly China Hero dvd is the worst dvd i have in my collection, it's worst than anything i have on my vhs collection as well. So if you have seen any of the once upon a time in china series i suggest you give this one a chance to see Jet Li play a light hearted version of the man that made him internationaly known"
4,Last hero in china,"This is the same movie as Deadly Chinese hero, only they changed the name. If you have Deadly chinese hero, you already have this movie."
4,Another Jet LI masterpiece!,"Jet Li is amazing in this action filled flick. Outstanding fight sequences, along with a cameo from martial arts film legend Gordon Liu as a bad guy. Some very Original fights, Including a must see battle between the centipede fighters and Jet li, using his newly masterd Rooster style kung fu. Great action, good story, and ofcourse Jet Li make for a spectacular mix."
4,Excellant Christian Music With A Classic Style,"Loved the song ""Teach me to wait"", sung as duet with a beat that makes you want to start singing along. The other songs are also very enjoyable with a classic gospel style that was refreshing but not ""old timey"" enough to feel dated. I especially enjoyed his versions of ""Praise the Lord"" and ""This Day"". I bought this album to get the song ""Teach me to Wait "" which I had heard on a Christian radio called Songtime but I was also very satisfied with the album as a whole."
3,MINI Book...Hard to see images!,"Beware that this is a mini book, which makes looking at Cattelan's artwork almost impossible. Cattelan is an incredibly funny, satiric, conceptual sculptor. His work makes fun of the gallery system in an intelligent way but also moves beyond the criticism of art politics. Some of his work has recently earned the presitgious title of ""controversial"" (the images of himself hanging from a tree). I put Cattelan in the same category as Manzoni, Fontana...great book but I would order the bigger one."
1,Does not fit vacuum,"The bag is unusable in the vacuum for which it is marketed. According to the written description and picture, this bag is made for this vacuum. It does not fit the attachment inside the vacuum and is completely unusable. It is a total waste of money."
4,Gong - 'OK Friends' (GAS),"Pulled from live recordings off of Gong's 2001 tour of the UK, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Itlay and France. Viva la Gong! Nicely assembled and edited by none other than the Gongship space whisper mistress, Gilli Smyth and I must say she did a fine job. Better than the 'Live 2 Infinity' disc. Tracks I thought made this CD a true keeper were ""Wise Man"", ""Doudouk Bloomdido"", the mystical ""Do You Believe In Magick?"", ""Can't Kill Me Sax"", the classic Gong piece ""Invisible Temple"" and the awesome closer ""Selene"". Much of the old gang is here, like Daevid Allen, Mike Howlett, Gilli Smyth {of course}, Didier Malherbe on doudouk, Graham Clark - violin, Theo Travis - flute & sax and Chris Taylor on drums. Most of the line-up when I saw them a year earlier. Took me a while to land down a copy at an affordable price. A worthy cosmic rock release, as well as a definite should-have."
3,Not a bad EP,"The Velvet Underground cover is incredible, as well as the live versions for Violet and Doll Parts, but the rest is quite dull. The cover art just looks like it's begging for attention, which is very annoying."
4,Hmmmmm.....,"I hate to admitt it, but I was kind of disappointed with this CD. I liked 'Over The Edge' a lot and 'Drown Soda'. I also liked this CD's version of 'Doll Parts'. On the other hand, I wasn't really entertained with the rest."
4,this cd is classic,"I really liked this CD, it is courtney and hole at their best early in their career."
2,good but not great,"I was slightly disappointed in this book, knowing it was a Zane Gray. The storyline is a love story, but the author dwells more on his views and tries to usealot of words to explain the surroundings. The physical dimensions of thebook was too large & bulky. Again, if your interest is in love stories, thenyou might enjoy this book."
2,A Bit Preachy,"This is primarily Grey's diatribe and condemnation of the lack of support of returning WWI combat veterans. A historical note: Those vets received no benefits and more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers suffered physical or mental injuries during The Great War, but in 1919 only 217 had completed rehabilitation programs. That sad chapter has similarities with the Walter Reed Hospital scandal over substandard treatment of U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.Bless Grey for taking up the cause back in the day, it must not have been very popular to do so at the time, but it got weary hearing one of the primary characters wax on and on about that issue. In addition, I had a real problem with the ending...suffice to say it would not have played out that way. He wrote better books."
2,Explore woman soul,"Less western, more what makes a woman tick. Not a favorite, skipped whole paragraphs after one too many trips through this girl's two page at a thought train."
4,Title Says It All,"If you weren't around in the 70s, or you want to ""relive"" this era, Ben Fong-Torres' book is a good place to start. It's a collection of many of his Rolling Stone feature articles, along with a brief update of the personalities involved. Having ""come of age"" in the 70s, it brought back memories of my own and it gave me insights into some of the most famous rock personalities of the 70s and early 1980s.Fong-Torres has an excellent writing style and ""captures"" a little bit about what made a lot of these musicians ""tick."" His articles are enjoyable to read or re-read if you've seen them before. While part of the title (A BackStage Pass to 20 Years of Rock n Roll) may seem cliched, it fits here. Fong-Torres in his Rolling Stone articles managed to catch a glimpse of an era now long gone."
3,Check the Table of Contents Before Purchasing,"Fong-Torres is a talented writer, but readers who are interested in rock 'n' roll history may wish to skip this book's chapters on people like Diane Keaton, Neil Diamond, Annie Leibovitz, Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, and (!) Rodney Dangerfield. (Steve Martin's is worth reading, however.)Not to worry, though, this volume does contain actual interviews and profiles with music industry folks like Ricky Nelson, Three Dog Night, and Dick Clark. You can probably see the problem with this book's title and cover image by now. And you might understand why I got excited when I came to the book's piece on Iggy Pop. Unfortunately, it was just a two-page description of an appearance Iggy did at a Tower Records.Drat."
2,I want to like this.,"The tracks are great.The playing (might be) great.The recording quality is wretched.I hate to say that, but it is that bad."
4,"Acceptable Sound, Amazing Performance","While some may question the sound quality on this release, the performance is amazing. As a huge fan of the Lemmy era of Hawkwind, I was overjoyed to find this concert had been released from a superior source tape, as this era is sorely underrepresented in terms of quality live releases. The band apparently performed a few pieces at this show that were never done before or after.Having listened to numerous bootleg recordings in the past, I am not too appalled by the sound found on this particular recording. It certainly is far better than what was found on the dreadful ""Bring me the Head of Yuri Gagarin"" release as well as some other semi-official Hawkwind releases.In summary, if you are a fan of pre-1976 Hawkwind and are not an absolutist audiophile, this concert is essential listening along with Space Ritual, Greasy Truckers Party, The 1999 Party, and the BBC show from 1972."
4,Great & functional,"I bought this wheeled laptop bag to use at work (in Sales). I end up taking it to Italy to visit family & friends for 3 weeks.Everything I needed (including the computer) was at my reach at all times.Sturdy, it survive check in & out of planes, security, car traveling all over Italy as well as traveling with 3 small kids (with all it involves).This is a must for an organized traveler."
4,[When You Gonna] Give It Up To Me,"I really like this song and I haven't had a chance to buy it yet but I plan on buying this with the other song ""It's So Fine"" by Sean Paul. I got the ""It's So Fine"" album and I have been trying to collect all of his past albums so I can listen to them when I'm driving in my car. Great listen."
2,If you're burdened to having to connect to a CISCO WLAN,"this may the only way you can do it. My netgear card would connect but couldn't meet all the security imposed on it...had to buy this expen$ive little darling. Worked fine but I really dislike being held captive to one vendor to use a network. But it IS CISCO so why am I surprised? regardless, performs well and is a bargain at half the price."
4,You can get it cheaper,"I purchased this card because the unique capabilities of our network required it. So I can't speak for it's features...But I only paid $25.00 for it. If you shop for this item on on-line auctions, you can get a very good deal."
2,big name - low rating,"I purchased the 350 wireless adapter as a second adaptor for a second laptop on my wireless LAN. My first laptop has a Compaq WL110 PCMCIA adaptor which out performs the Cisco hands down on range and connectivity. The Cisco comes with some fancy disgnostic tools which states signal to noise ratios with no loss whereas a simple ping test clearly displays packet loss. I am disappointed as a IT proffessional and someone who thought that a cisco card would be the best. Not the case, buy Compaq or 3com."
2,"An adequate, but enjoyable look at grown stanford frat boys","Willie Williams and his fraternity brothers from ""the University"" (Stanford thinly disguised) go through the second world war and return to pick up their lives. Their problems are as expected: the cold war, the Vietnam War, their alienated offspring, and -- par for the course for Drury -- latent homosexuality among some of the brothers and marital problems (usually boredom and the greener grass syndrome) among most of the others. Trite as it sounds, the book will entertain you, especially if you formed an attachment to this group whom Drury first introduced in ""Toward What Bright Glory"". Even though it is a distinctly mid brow read, chances are if you start it, you'll hang on until the not so surprising end."
5,pop up splendor,"A wonderful book for tiny hands and eyes, moveable parts and simple words, bright, clear illustrations, a must for car and engine obsessed little ones."
2,Didn't really work,"I purchased this for my father who about 10 times a day puts his cup of coffee in the microwave to warm it up. I figured this would save him a lot of time if it worked. However, it just didn't keep the coffee hot enough. Nice idea though.And before anyone comments saying he didnt use it correctly, he did. He poured a fresh cup of hot coffee, used this coffee warmer like a coaster. Within about 30 minutes, he had to make another trip to the microwave."
1,warm only not hot,"It keeps your coffee warm but not hot. The problem is that most cups that are made do not have a flat bottom, therefor do not have enough contact with the heater to transfere heat to the cup."
1,Damaged after first use,"The first time I plugged in this device, part of the plastic melted away and the device became useless. I consider it a total waste of money."
4,Warmer,I would be lost without my coffee mug warmer. I hate to get hot coffee and in 10 minutes it is cold. This warmer does the trick and keeps the mug hot.
2,The photo and product specs. give the impression that it is larger than it is.,"I have had a white one for years and very happy with it. However, I purchased two new mugs that were larger on the bottom than my other mugs. I looked at the black warmers and the photo appeared larger than the white one. Also, the dimensions state a larger size. It is not. The burner is exactly the same size as the white one."
3,Best 2 out of 3,"It is hard for me to rate this product for the following reason. We purchased three of these Mug Warmers at the same time, to have in different rooms in our house. One of the three stopped working (stopped heating) after just two weeks of intermittant use and had to be returned. The other two are working well. Since two out of three (66%) is closest to 3 stars (60%) I will give the product three stars."
1,waste of money,"Fast deleivery as usual from Amazon, but don't waste your money. This coffee warmer doesn't keep coffee more thann lukewarm at best. Spend more on the Norpro and you'll be very satisfied. I gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it less."
5,Hot Stuff!,"I bought this item and have been really happy with it! Having my coffee become lukewarm was a real pet peeve, but no more! Every sip is now just the perfect temperature... not hot enough to burn my tongue, but definitely hot, not warm. A caution... if you forget to put your cup on the warmer and your drink does cool down, the warmer is not hot enough to heat it up.Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer"
1,"Shame on you, Mr Coffee!","Jeez, I figured you guys KNEW about coffee! This is a terrible excuse for a warmer. It keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature, not nearly warm enough to be pleasant. I bought two of them and am tossing them out. Anyone considering this item? DON'T buy one!!!"
3,It works...generally,"This is a coffee WARMER, not a coffee ""heater"". It will keep your beverage from getting ice cold but not keep your beverage piping hot. My home office is very cold in the winter and this does not do what I had hoped by keeping my beverage hot, but it is better than nothing...I still have to pop my mug in the microwave to re-heat. It may work better in the summer.It does get hot to the touch so I don’t know why it doesn’t heat a mug better.Also, you have to remember to TURN IT OFF! I have left this thing on several times...a little scary...and don’t accidentally sit something on it other than a mug!Good thing it is inexpensive.Good thing it is inexpensive."
3,Keeps coffee warm...not hot...,"I plug this in before going to the kitchen so it's ready when my coffee is brewed. I put it on the warmer straight from the pot. Then I get on my computer and tend to forget about it...which is why I purchased this product. But it doesn't keep it hot...just warm...very warm, but still just warm. Loses it's appeal after a while as mildly hot coffee is not very appetizing. I like that ""Sip...Ahhhh"" feeling you get from hot but not scalding coffee. So, I either need to find a better warmer or just drink my coffee faster...Having said that, it is definite improvement on NOT having a warmer..."
5,Perfect!,Love it.... Now I can enjoy my entire cup of tea or coffee and take my time... Hot to the last drop!
3,"Not bad, but not necessarily worth it.","I bought this thinking how it'd be nice to have warm coffee while playing games on the computer, but it is not very effective. I ended up just not using it."
3,Not as good as expected from Mr. Coffee,"I had an ""off the wall brand"" coffee cup warmer sitting on my desk at work for years. LOVED IT! At times, my hot tea would be too hot, but I was ok with it. But, after many years of use, it died. I couldn't find another one like it. So, I researched the internet, found & read reviews on the different coffee cup warmers. They all had positive & negative feedback. But, Mr. Coffee had the least negativity. The main complaint was that it didn't get very hot, and barely kept your beverage warm. I gave it a chance anyway because of the brand. Well, it DOESN'T keep my hot tea hot like my old warmer. At best, it keeps my tea ""luke warm"". My tea doesn't get totally cold as it would without a warmer. But, I do find that sometimes, I still get up & pop my tea in the microwave to make it hot, and then I put it back on my warmer. I guess I am spoiled by the old warmer I had. It's better than nothing."
1,not warm enough,"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer will only keep your coffee, or whatever, a little warmer than room temperature. Bought three of these pieces of junk for the office. They're going back to the store for a refund. Coffe has to be up to a certain degree of temperature to taste right. This junker does not reach that temperature."
5,Very Very Good,"so far this is the best. Please don't expect this heater can heat up your coffee, this is only keep your coffee warm and stay the temperature around 60 to 70 degree."
4,Just right!,"...meaning not too hot not too cold- mfg. knows what they're doing in the design... not the self-appointed ""critic geniuses"" spouting off left and right here.. Yes, put a coaster or lid atop your mug to retain even more heat if you need it warmer (will also lessen evaporation)...just common sense...lol! The diameter of the heated surface is apporoximately 3 and 7/16ths of an inch so it will accomodate a mug that's medium large in size(a little bigger than average)."
4,Use the right Mug,This warmer does a good job of keeping your beverage hot. But your mug does make a difference. All mugs you buy have the raised ring on the bottom so the entire bottom does not touch the warming plate. You need to look around for a ceramic mug like the ones that are made by hand with a completely flat bottom. You can find them on line. Also the bigger mugs don't work well either. I use an 16 oz. Mug. It's bulb shaped. Wide at the bottom then narrows at the top. I have several that I bought at local craft fairs. It keeps my coffee at a drinkable temp. for hours. Covering the top helps too but I don't need to do that.
1,Lots to be desired,Very disappointing. Barely keeps the coffee warm. 17 watts not enough. Have another brand at 25 watts and is much better. Didnt realize there was so much difference. At $10 cant expect too much. Not worth that much. Not worth returning. Dont buy if you like your coffee hot.
1,Luke-warmish is more like it.,"Barely applies any heat to the cup. Fresh-off-the-stove water was luke-warm within 15 minutes. Very poor, and highly disappointing, performance. Would never buy another ""Mr. Coffee"" cup warmer."
2,Coffee Never Hot Enough,"My coffee cup just barely fit on the plate. I thought I would try a different manufacturer of mug warmers. I already had one that worked. Both products worked the same. I realize that the voltage has a limit on it, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot enough unless you can drink your cup of coffee in 30 minutes. I sip on mine for 2 hours and get very tired of continually having to zap the coffee in the microwave just to heat it up while still using the coffee warmer.Can the manufacturer's come up with a better idea that actually works?"
5,Great item,Just what I needed since I drink my coffee really slow and with this cup warmer it keeps my coffee warm to the last drop.
1,Didn't do the trick,"I wanted this to use for tea when I'm away from home and it doesn't get hot enough, not even tepid."
5,"AMAZING, WONDERFUL DEVICE!","Sometimes it takes me forever to get to my coffee, and by then it's cold. Cold coffee sucks! So I microwave it 3-4 times a morning and it progressively tastes worse and worse. Well I tell you: it's all the microwave's fault! I just finished the last sip of a coffee that I poured over 6 hours ago, and it was just as warm and delicious as it was 5 hours and 50 minutes ago (see, I really am slow)! Now that I have my Mr Coffee warmer I am a happy, more efficient worker. I need to get another one for my home! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!"
4,Coffee Cup Warmer,"I am satisfied with this product, BUT some of my coffee mugs are too big to sit properly on the warmer. I have to remember to use a smaller cup in order for it to work properly. I had a warmer I used for several years, but alas it died. It did a wonderful job, can't remember the brand, and it was large enough to accommodate my larger mugs."
5,Hot Coffee All Day,Glad to have found this nifty little device. Works as advertised. Keeps your beverage hot without over-cooking it. I think this would work well with a big mug of soup as well. Can't tell you how many half-consumed mugs of coffee have been saved by this. It's great to pick up my mug an hour after I poured the coffee into it and take a hot swig.
2,"Same as everyone, not warm enough....","I bought 2 of these to give one to my fiancé and take one to work to replace one that I have had for over 10 years. She is happy with it because she prefers her coffee lukewarm, I on the other hand like mine fresh from the pot hot and am quite displeased with this one since it only stays lukewarm.I've gone back to my 10+ year old one and the new one is now being used as a ""candle warmer""."
2,switch broke after 9 months,I arrived home today from work to find the Mr Coffee warmer still on and heating. I assumed I must have forgotten to switch it off though I try to be careful about that but I had turned it off. Should I feel lucky it didn't start a fire? It didn't even last a year so easily rates as a piece-o-junk in my book.
1,Name I know but....,"This thing was a waste of my money.Thought that this item would be a good buy because of the brand since I have a coffee pot that is over 10 years old and has been with me longer than anything I own,but I was wrong.It won't even keep a cup of coffee warm not to even mention hot.Save your money wait till around Christmas time and get one at the dollar stores or someplace."
4,Nice but not hot enough,This product looks nice and is easy to operate but it doesn't keep coffee hot enough. I'm not one of those people who likes their coffee scalding hot either. It definitely does the trick but that's my only beef with it. It might work better with a closed-top mug.
4,It works ok.,"This warmer will do exactly that - keep coffee ""warm"", but definitely not hot. I guess if it kept coffee hot they would have called it a coffee ""heater""... It's just ok. Keeps coffee from going luke-warm or cold."
1,This coffee warmer absolutely does not work!,"I bought the thing, then read the reviews. I tried everything including using a flat bottom cup for maximum contact, pre-heating the cup and making sure the coffee was hot when put on the device. I left the warmer on for 5 minutes so it was ""hot"" before putting the coffee on it. When one does this, the coffee COOLS OFF(!) when on the warmer. Gets cooler! It simply does not run hot enough to work. It does work if you only put an inch of pre-heated coffee in a pre-heated cup. Then it keeps it semi hot. I took mine back to BB&B."
4,Does the job,"I researched the internet and read all the Amazon reviews, and decided to add the Mr. Coffee warmer to my wishlist. My sister bought it for me and I've been using it for less than a week so far. I have to say that I think it preforms quite well. I have not tried putting a room temp or cold beverage on it yet, but will since it may just be strong enough. The less liquid in your mug, the hotter it gets and stays. The first time I used it, there was a melting or burning plastic smell, but this is to be expected and never occured again. This one does not come with a mug which I was dissapointed about, but my ""the Office"" mug works just fine. I might suggest using it with a mug that has a top or cover since this would maintain heat even better. The black color blends in with my desk and it's quite small as not to be an eye-sore. I'd reccommend this item, and it's saving me time and money since I'm not dumping cold coffee and buying more anymore."
3,Keeps Warm Coffee Warm - Generally,"If you are looking for a method of reheating cool coffee - this is not it. This product does not warm up coffee. Rather it tries to keep it warm, with varying success.The coffee warmer will keep you cup about the same temperature it was when you first put in down. This varies with the amount in the cup. With less in the cup, the coffee might actually get warmer. With more in the cup or with a large full cup, it might actually cool somewhat.The heat output is about equal to a 15 watt light bulb."
5,Great Coffee Warmer,"I bought one of these coffee warmers to keep my coffee warm at the office. It really does the job. Note you cannot pour cold coffee into a mug and expect this device to heat it -- that isn't the purpose. If you set your warm coffee on this heater, get up go get something out of the printer, get distracted talk to people, come back to your desk 15 min later your coffee will still be warm, maybe even hot depending on how hot it was when you poured it in there. I love it. I bought one for home too. The success of the coffee warmer is also dependent on your coffee mug. I find it works best with coffee mugs that have a large surface area at the bottom. I would definitely recommend this product -- I already have, I love it."
3,could be hotter,Same complaint as the rest. It could be hotter. I think if I can find a flat bottom coffee mug it will do much better.
5,Works Great,"This little warmer works great. It will not really heat a full cup of cold coffee, but it will keep hot coffee very hot, and will heat up a half cup of coffee very well."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"THIS DOESN'T EVEN KEEP COFFEE LUKEWARM!!! MY OLD THAT I HAD FOR OVER 20 YRS. WAS STILL WORKING, BUT THE PLASTIC WAS CRACKED UNDERNEATH,SO IT WASN'T SAFE TO USE ANYMORE. I CAN'T EVEN FIND THE BRAND ANYMORE...(IT WAS SOME LITTLE KNOWN BRAND, BUT IT SURE WORKED GREAT FOR $9.99) OH WELL, I JUST GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GULP MY COFFEE AND GET UP OFF MY REAR END AND HEAT IT IN THE MICROWAVE WHEN IT GETS LUKEWARM...UGH!!!"
1,"Didn't Work, Period","I read several of the reviews before buying and kept in mind several of the recommendations. I actually ordered 2 thinking to give one as a stocking stuffer and keep one for myself. I tried the first one and it basically didn't work from the get go (broken I guess). So didn't give the other one as a gift, kept it (didn't want to give a bad gift). Finally got around to trying the second one out... put a steaming cup of hot tea on it, probably drank half the cup pretty quickly but the second half sat there for quite a while and when I went to drink it, COLD. I hate to say it but I would not recommend it."
2,Still not hot enough,"I started out with hot coffee the temperature that I like but it did not keep it that temperature. Still not hot enough for me, but then McDonald's coffee doesn't scare me."
5,AWESOME!,I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
2,Coffee hardly warm after 15 min.,"I was just hoping for it to keep my coffee somewhere close to hot for a while. My coffee, in a normal coffee mug, is barely warm after 10-15 minutes on this. Yeah, it's warmer than it would be without it but I still have to go warm it up with fresh coffee if I want to enjoy it. My expectations were low. I don't even like my coffee very hot. Did NOT expect this thing to let me down but it has. It keeps my coffee at about 5 seconds worth of microwaving."
3,Not bad but not great,"This mug warmer keeps my coffee slightly above luke warm. I find the coffee is still enjoyable at that temperater but im easy.The mug i use is slightly curved at the bottom and can be the cause of the less than stellar performance, but i've looked around for a mug that is COMPLETELY flat at the bottom and havn't been able to find one. I'm sure it exists out there and has alluded me.Anyways, this will keep your coffee warm and drink able and perhaps it will perform better with different mugs. I say this product is acceptable. I might do a more indepth review by actually measuring the temp of my coffee after a certain amount time has passed. I have 2 other types of coffee mug warmers and it should be interesting to see the results."
2,Only 17 Watts,Made in China. Doesn't keep my coffee warm enough. If I have a traditional small coffee mug that is half full it will keep pretty hot but if it's 3/4 full or a larger coffee mug then the coffee gets gets cold or at least not at the 125-130F degree I like. I'm returning and looking for more wattage. 17 watts isn't enough for me.
2,Not Very Good!,This product did not work in my case. It did NOT keep my Hot Tea - Hot or warm for much longer than normal. Not sure why but I wouldn't recommend! [:@]
2,MR Coffee mug warmer,"I've been mostly pleased with items from Amazon, but need to say the Mr Coffee mug warmer was a real disapointment in that it only keeps coffe or any liquids slightly warmer than lukewarm. Picked up a second-hand Rival mug warmer and it works great! OH Well"
4,Pretty Good,I bought this for office use. It's pretty good. It does keep my coffee warm through out the day. Nice in winter.
3,hot product but warm coffee,Works as expected except it does not keep the coffee as warm as my previous one did. It keeps it luke warm but not hot in the same ceramiccup I have used for about ten years..
5,I like it!,"I like this product enough to specifically turned my computer on to write a review. It worked better than expected and kept my beverage warm. It's a mug warmer so, no, it doesn't bring your beverages to a boil (I seem to have read complaints that it doesn't heat up their beverages, though that could be for a similar product.) I think my tea was actually a bit hotter than the original temperature when I pulled it out of the microwave and put it on the warmer. I am just very happy that my tea doesn't turn cold within 5-10 minutes."
3,Mr. Coffee,Didn't really keep the tea hot but my husband will use in the office setting.I liked the fact that it was small and compact.
2,Mr Coffee Mug Warmer,"I have several ""Mr Coffee"" branded products which is why I chose this one. Have to say I am disappointed. My coffee gets luke warm then cold using this product which is disappointing. I would not recommend this product to others."
4,Great gift,"I was given this as a christmas gift, and it's more than lived up to my expectations.It won't heat a cold cup of coffee, but it will keep a cup at a very nice temperature for a very long time.Works best if you actually drink the coffee, the less coffee in the cup, the more effective it is... A full cup of coffee left for a couple hours will moderately warm, but if you actually drink the coffee slowly over time, the end will still be a good temp."
4,Nice little appliance.,"Pros:It keeps my mom's coffee warm while she reads her news paper, and it made a awesome gift. It makes candles smell really good too.Cons:Dont spill your coffee on it or its ruined._."
3,Prevents it from getting cold.,"I do like mine and am glad I got it, but it's not a warmer as much as a chill-prevent-er."
4,could be hotter,I wanted to like this device....nice long cord .....switch on the base.....nice looking....but...It just did not get hot enough for my taste.....nice and warm but not hot....as we get older we want hotter it seems.....tried different glass and ceramic cups but sorry not hot enough.....heater is 17 watt....would like to have one at about 25 watts.
2,Underwhelmed and lukewarm,"I'm underwhelmed by this mug warmer, but perhaps that's the best we can hope for.Pros:Switch is in the base, not four feet away in the far reaches of the middle of cord.Light tells you it's on, when not blocked by the mug.It has not yet burned house down when I forget to turn it off.It still works after I forgot to turn it off.Cons:It does not turn self off -- wasting electricity.Short cord barely reaches existing electrical source at a desk with a multi-plug power strip.Lukewarm is it.Has lasted two months."
1,Arrived defective,Bought three of them for use around the house to replace one that I have had for years.All three produced a strong odor of burning plastics and electronics.
3,"Very hot to the touch, but doesn't keep my coffee warm","Perhaps this mug warmer would work better with a mug that had no convex ""dimple"" on the bottom, so as to put more surface area in contact with the warmer. I don't know, but I do know that while it is *very* hot to the touch (it would burn my fingers if I didn't pull them away quickly), it doesn't keep my coffee from cooling, and it certainly isn't making it hot. I suppose I'm glad to have its cooling slowed down slightly, but I still have to go microwave it periodically if I want it more than slightly warm."
2,Mr Coffee mug warmer,I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
2,Almost dangerous,I used these as candle warmers rather than coffee mug warmers. I bought 5 of these and would turn them on probably 15-20 minutes at a time. They ended up almost exploding or busting open after a while and exposed the insides. It scared me. One of them just stopped working altogether. I'm completely disappointed with this product.
2,must have got a dud,"got it through amazon.only keeps coffee luke warm.old sharper image can warmer cooler died after 4 years,services tomorrow,it blew this mr coffee plate away.can not find that type anywhere.would not recomend this item to anyone.."
2,Overheats the liquid,"I am on vacation and purchased this product as I love another brand (forget which one) at home. I am finding it is making the coffee taste burned when it gets down to less than 1/2 mug. Am wondering, after reading other reviews, if there is a lack of consistency in the manufacturing."
4,"Good quality, perfect temperature","I bought this to keep my tea and coffee warm while I work at my desk for extended periods of time. The power cord is a decent length, so that I can plug it into my power strip on the floor and fit the cup warmer on the corner of my desk. It keeps beverages the right temperaure--not lukewarm, not scalding hot. Just hot enough to drink without fear of burning your tongue.Has an on/off switch which is nice, you don't have to unplug the device for it to stop heating.Would have preferred to power it through a usb cable though, so that I can really take it everywhere with me!"
2,Not worth it,This warmer looks better than it works. Does not keep beverages hot....only slightly warm. Might be ok for kids drinks but not adults. Wont buy another one.
3,Not the best,"The problem with this warmer is that is only keeps the bottom of your coffee hot. If you put a full cup on top of the warmer, it doesnt keep it hot. For the price, I guess it is better than nothing."
1,"Doesn't really keep the coffee hot, just luke warm. Not like the first one I had but wasn't Mr. Coffee","This product does NOT keep the liquids in your cup hot, just luke warm and I would not have purchased it if I knew this. I had a different brand before and it was wonderful but after 3 years just stopped working. It kept my coffee warmer than when I first got if out of the coffee maker, so that shows you it really worked, but this Mr Coffee doesn't do that, its lukewarm at best."
1,Enough cup thermal insulation was not possible,"The rating watt of this product was 17 watts. It was place, 53-55 degrees centigrade that measured surface temperature. Because wattage was low, cups enough for the surface temperature were not temperature to keep it warm, and there were not enough effects for cup thermal insulation. I expect a product with constant thermal effect (surface temperature 78-80 degrees centigrade)."
4,warmer works as advertised,the warmer works as advertised. Keeps my mug warm. The shipping was delayed so much so that I contacted Amazon... but it did show up within the days Amazon told me.
2,it doesn't get hot enough and has much less wattage than my old one.,it doesn't get hot enough and has much less wattage than my old one. Where can I find one a better one???
4,Useful and practical,"I find this coffee warmer useful and practical. Some complained that it does not generate enough heat to heat up the coffee, and they are mistaken about the purpose of the product. It is not a coffee maker, it is a coffee warmer. It is good for keeping warm coffee warm, not to make cold coffee hot. I would be better if it can automatically turn on or off with the presence or absence of the mug. At it is, I have to remember turning it off at the end of the day."
1,Where the hey does one find a flat bottomed mug?,"I ordered two of this item, so certain was I that this would do the trick for my coffee staying hot. It makes complete sense to me that it needs a flat bottomed mug in order to work efficiently and I never gave a thought when ordering that a flat bottomed mug would be so elusive!I have looked high and low. If anyone reading this review knows where I can locate such an animal, please let me know before I send this purchase back. Without the aforementioned flat bottomed mug, the product does a very poor job - so poor as to be useless!"
2,I shouldn't have...,"I purchased this hoping it would eliminate the need to run to the microwave to heat up my coffee... But, it hasn't done the job for me. I've only used it a few times and each time, it made my coffee taste funky. And, trust me - it's not the coffee. I've used the same coffee and coffee maker for at least 2 years.It's obviously worked for many that purchased it - so that's great. But, it has not met my expectations.The good thing is that it was only $10. I will end up donating it in hopes someone else will be happy with it.Sorry, Mr. Coffee. I don't like giving less than stellar reviews, but had to this time..."
2,"Warm, not hot","This is my second coffee warmer. I lost my first one, a no-name cheap model that worked beautifully, so I bought two of the Mr. Coffee version, one for me and one for my spouse. It really won't maintain the temperature of the coffee until your cup is down to about 1 ounce left. I would not recommend this product. We had the same experience with both Mr. Coffee warmers, so it wasn't a case of a defective item. It just doesn't work."
2,Disappointed,"This mug warmer does NOT keep coffee at the temperature it was when I put the ceramic cup on the warmer. It keeps it warm, yes, but not hot. I still have to reheat it if i leave it for any length of time.It might be fine if you're drinking warm milk, but if you like hot coffee, I think you'll be disappointed -- as I am.The lack of auto shut-off is a problem, but I knew that when I bought it, so I just have to be vigilant about turning it off when I leave my desk."
2,Disappointed with the finish,The unit I received is full of scratches on the surface. I am not sure if it's a brand new unit or not. since it works fine I just didn't bother to exchange for another one.
4,great value,Great value for the price. It does only have one setting but it keeps my coffee warm for hours! Because of the pictures I thought this was battery operated so it should be noted this needs to be plugged into an outlet.
3,only adequate,"I'm not real pleased with this. Even if I start out with a hot beverage, it soon cools to warm and then maintains a just warm temperature. I have a much older electric mug warmer that I picked up at a yard sale several years ago that works a lot better than this. Disappointing."
3,See review below...,"It does a good job of keeping the coffee hot, but the pilot light is hidden behind the cup and it's too easy to pick up the last cup and not notice that the light's still on...and heat's being made. Or you can just leave the cup on the warmer with the heat on over the weekend for a Monday morning surprise. The light should be diametrically opposite the electric cord."
4,its very nice!,the warmer takes a little time but is quickish. the warmer is good quality. its something nice to have around.
5,Hot Coffee,"This is the 4th mugwarmer that I have bought - still using the other 3 in different places. Had a hard time trying to find one in the stores, so I was thankful to find one on Amazon.com. I selected this one because it was a good price and seemed more substantial than the others. So far it works great - no complaints at all. My other mugwarmers are white. I like the black color because it seems to blend better with my nice wooden office desk. I would recommend it!"
2,Needs an AutoShutoff switch,"I like the Mr Coffee cup warmer in most respects. However, a couple of features that are sorely missing and I am surprised that this product can be marketed without them.There is no auto shutoff switch. I have had other cup warmers in the past that would shutoff after an hour. They also had a sensor that would shut off if no cup was present.I have left my cup warmer on with no cup sitting there a burning all night when I was sleeping. How much more would it cost to add these important safety and energy conservation capabilities.I would gladly pay the difference."
1,The WORST!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,Ok.....I threw away the one I was using in my office before this because it was no longer getting my cups of coffee hot...only tepid and therefore wasting energy. Silly me. I was SURE ( since I read all reviews) that this mug warmer by Mr. Coffee would be so great that I just tossed my old one before receiving this. HUGE mistake! This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! I tried for days with several different shaped mugs of tea or coffee ...nothing..none of them got more than BARELY tepid! It is very hot to the touch.....but for some ridiculous reason it WILL NOT HEAT YOUR CUP OF LIQUID....and I'm speaking of a hot cup of coffee to start with! I was so surprised that I kept trying different mugs...thinking maybe it's the shape or...??? Nothing worked. Nothing.Please do not waste your time. Do not purchase this product!!
3,Getting warmer...,"...But still not quite warm enough.I thought I'd finally found it - a replacement for my 6+ year old coffee cup warmer with on/off switch on the warmer (not the cord) - which had been reliably keeping my cups of coffee piping hot until one day it simply quit.I've been through umpteen different warmers of all shapes and sizes since then, and I had high hopes for this one by Mr Coffee - I mean it's Mr Coffee - surely they know how to keep a cup of coffee warm, right?Wrong. Sadly, while this one does perform slightly better than the last warmer I tried - it does NOT keep coffee warm enough to suit me.I'm still using it - but I'm also still on the look out for a warmer that meets my needs."
2,Fair at best,"I agree with the others. You have to use a flat bottom mug. I looked through my large collection, and they all have a small lip on the bottom. This is the only part of the mug touching the hot plate, and that tiny amount of surface will not keep the beverage hot, unless the cup is nearly empty. My old one worked all day, everyday, for 14 years. I never paid attention to the manufacturer. Too bad. Now I still have to go to the microwave every few minutes to heat my drink. I wish I could find out what kind of cup the 4 and 5 star reviewers have."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased the Mr. Coffee mug warmer because it was economical and I believed Mr. Coffee to be a reputable brand.Don't waste your money on this mug warmer, even if it's economical. There are good points -- nice length to the cord; convenient on/off switch. But the reason for purchasing a mug warmer is to keep the contents warm, even somewhat heated. This warmer does not do that. It barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. I previously had a warmer by Continental Electric which kept the coffee at a very nice temperature and it was never cooled to the ""tepid"" point.This model is not worth the money or effort. Check out the Continental Electric instead, even if it's more expensive."
4,Effectiveness depends on the cup,"This pad does get pretty hot, but how well it keeps your beverage hot really depends on the cup that you use. The problem is that most (all?) mugs have a circular bottom, so the actual surface area that contacts the pad is pretty small. That being said, my drink never really got colder than a step hotter than lukewarm, so I guess it works fine!Safety is somewhat of a concern, though. It uses a simple on/off switch, and I'm not sure what will happen if it is left on for days at a time. I think a system where it is only on when a cup is on it would be awesome.Your cup also sits about an inch higher off the table, so risk of knocking it over is a bit higher.Overall, a good and cheap solution to the everyday first world problem of keeping a hot drink hot."
3,Works fine but prefer the mug-activated switch,"This works fine, but I would much rather have gotten the mug-activated one. This one only has an on-off switch and you can inadvertently leave it on all day and night."
2,Doesn't keep coffee warm,"Purchased this in 2010. Doesn't keep coffee warm. Well, barely warm -- but significantly cooler than I'd like. My preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured -- not crazy hot, but more than lukewarm. This isn't even close. And don't even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you've been carrying it around for a few minutes."
4,Dandy Idea,"I have two of these. One is in my home office and the other is in the kitchen. For the most part this is an excellent appliance, as long as you use it to its optimum capability. If you use a deep mug with a narrow circumference your hot beverage isn't going to be as warm as a cup with a wider circumference. Simply put, the mug will stay warmer if it comes in contact with more of the warming base. I found this out rather unintentionally since I usually grab whichever mug is within close reach. I noticed that the wider mug was warmer.Under the best conditions, this mug keeps my morning joe warm for however long it takes for me to scarf down a whole cup. It's nice to have a last sip that is as pleasant as the first."
4,Just what I needed!,"My oversized mug has a standard-size bottom, and it fits on the heating element with tons of room to spare. I start with a mug of scalding-hot tea and place it on this warmer, and the scalding temperature does come down to the perfect drinkable temperature and there it stays. When the tea level gets really low, though, the tea temperature does rise considerably. I have no complaints. The cord is plenty long enough to put on my cubicle desk, snake across and down through the allotted cord hole a foot or so away, then down to the outlet. The on/off switch isn't smooth, but that's hardly a problem."
1,Caution: It does what it claims it will do.,"I have two other cup warmers, but this was to be my third. It does EXACTLY what it claims to do: it is a cup WARMER. So, if you enjoy picking up a cup of WARM coffee -- you know -- like SPIT, 99 degress in your 98.6 degree mouth, well, good news, boppers, this is the cup warmer for you!"
2,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer truely is a mug warmer. I use it daily. My mug is warm, but my beverage isn't."
3,Not hot enough for me,"i bought this item through a retail store, and i'm rather disappointed in that the warmer does not keep beverages hot enough for my liking. A pipng hot beverage, fresh from the microwave, will soon be just ""warm"" for the duration of the drink. Not ""hot"". If that's what you like, this is the baby for you! IF you like your drinks hot, you will probably be like the many users who reviewed it herein, and find it a little lacking. IF i had paid full price, i would have probably returned it. I may experiment with some metal mugs (rather than ceramic) to see if this helps, but based on other reviews, not too hopeful..."
4,"Good heat, limited space",The warmer works just fine at keeping coffee warm. The switch on the body of the unit is easy to locate (as opposed to one on the cord). The one downside is that it is too small to hold a very large mug. I guess it just holds the standard size.
1,Did not heat up enough,"I purchased this item for my husband, who likes very hot coffee and tea, but it does not keep beverages warm as advertised. We tried it a few times and even when his mug went straight from the coffee pot to the warmer, it didn't keep it warm. Too bad, so sad. I returned it."
2,"Worked Fine, Then Stopped Working","Pros: It does what it's supposed to - keeps drinks warm.Cons: The warming surface is a little small, doesn't fit wider mugs. Mine stopped working after a month, and I'm not sure why. It may not be spill proof, because I got some coffee on top... perhaps it shorted somehow?Bottom line: OK, but might be a better one out there..."
1,lukewarm,"I do not like my coffee HOT, but the coffee cup warmer I had for almost 30 years kept it at a very nice warm temperature. This one is barely lukewarm, and I do not have a very thick mug, which I am sure the heat would not penetrate at all. Don't waste your money."
4,Love it!,I was worried that I would buy this product and it wouldn't work because of the price. The Mr. Coffe mug warmer works and is worth the money.
1,You Get What You Pay For,This warmer doesn't even begin to keep coffee warm. Don't waste your time or money. Very disappointed given the Mr. Coffee brand...
1,Oversize Coaster,"Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm."
2,Barely warm,"As usual Amazon service and delivery was superb. The product however, the Mr. Coffee cup warmer is barely that...that is it's barely warm. These are supposed to keep your coffee, tea, or other hot drink hot. Not scalding, but hot enough to enjoy as a hot drink. I'm sorry I made the purchase."
4,I'm pleased.,"I was tired of drinking cold coffee. I drink slowly. This little warmer is perfect for me. It does keep liquids pretty warm, not hot. It also seems pretty safe, it does not turn off automatically...but it doesn't get so hot that I worry about starting a fire. It didn't cost a lot, and it is not bad looking. I consider it a good deal, and I would buy it again."
2,Disappointing...,"About the only good thing I can say about these Mr. Coffee Mug ""warmers"" is that they'll never burn your coffee. Even with the cup 2/3 empty, it STILL can't keep the coffee warm. If you like to drink your coffee hot and you want your ""warmer"" to keep it hot, this is most definitely NOT the warmer for you. If you like lukewarm, maybe it is, b/c that's the best it'll do.Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer"
4,Convenient,"I bought this warmer to use at my desk at work. I like having a mug of herbal tea handy throughout the day. My only complaint is that it doesn't keep my tea as warm as my old warmer did. I do like that this warmer is black. My old warmer was white, and looked pretty bad by the time it died."
2,Mr. Coffee warmer,I thought this was the coffee warmer that shuts off after no movments. I was wrong. It sill burns my coffee if I forget to turn is off overnight. It works as well as most others. None keep the coffee really hot. It does help to have a coffee cup with a larger base instead of the cups which get narrow toward the bottom.
1,Warmer,"Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop. Most of the time I get good deals but to be careful, you can get ripped off too."
3,Coffee mug warmer,"Not really surprised that this doesn't work all that well as most of the reviews were negitive, but my daughter wanted it for Christmas. Some things you just have to learn for yourself."
3,Looks ok,Haven't used but took out of box. Nice long cord so placing it for use won't be a problem. Otherwise unsure of how it will work ...
4,Cool!,"4 stars for now, haven't used it, as it is a gift for my uncle. Packaging was nice, shipped on time, and no damage from what I can see. Will update review once my uncle uses it."
2,Fur coat and no Knickers,"The warmers don't keep fluid warm. I read my comments and in trying to be humorous i became inarticulate. As you can see. I purchased three of Mr. Coffee mug warmers. As one of the last of the big spenders I expected to keep coffee warmer than tepid. I know that burning houses down is not good for the Mr. Coffee image but in ""She Who must be obeyed's"" dressing room, She who rules, bedside cabinet and subserviant he, lukewarm isn't what we wanted - so she tells me. I intend to try one of another brand and see if there is a difference. Want to buy nearly unused coffee warmers - well known brand?Is this the hyper link? [...]"
3,Okay product,"Keeps your coffee warm but as other reviewers mentioned, not *really* warm. For a similar priced product that works great (I got one from my employer)google for the Brookstone coffee warmer."
2,if luke-warm is all you need,"Like some of the reviews says, it keeps my drink warm (only luke warm actually) and even if I put a really hot drink on, it won't sustain the temperature."
3,Not compatible for Australia,"Unfortunately this is not suitable for use in Australia and I have had to return it. Otherwise, it's a good concept!"
2,warm at best,"If want your coffee to stay hot this will not do it, mildly warm at best. With fire considerations I guess there isn't one that will truly keep you coffee hot, just have your expectations in line when ordering."
1,Does Not Keep My Coffee Hot,"I decided to replace my warmer I've had for years which was not keeping my coffee as hot as it used to. After reading the reviews, I purchased this warmer and was disappointed that it didn't keep my coffee hot. My old warmer kept my coffee hotter than this one. I used the same cup on both warmers so it's not the cup I'm using. I'm sadly returning this."
1,not worth the money,"This a a huge waste of money. I am so disappointed in Mr. Coffee, I've liked their other products but this does NOT keep your cup of coffee even lukewarm."
5,Mr Coffee you are a legend!,"I shipped this product to the southern most tip of Africa because nothing comparable was available locally.I fitted the power converter necessary to cater for our 220v, and I now have seriously hot coffee available 24/7.To even boost the heat retention more, I'm using an enamel cup with a lid to keep the heat in.Nothing compares.All in, the shipping + power converter cost more than the cup warmer, but it was worth every cent.Very happy customer.Tam"
4,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,"Bought three for home & offices. Large heating surface keeps hot coffee hot and warms cooled coffee eventually. Wipe the warming surface after spills; it will last much longer.Wish the ""on"" light was bigger & brighter as reminder to turn off."
2,Warmer??,"As usual did extensive research before purchase. The product lives up to its name as a ""Warmer."" If you want to keep your drink luke warm this is the item for you. However, it will not keep coffee hot."
4,Fine product,"This coffee warmer works great. It works better if the cup has a lid, I use a box of guitar stings to cover the mug. My only problem is that I forget to put my coffee cup on it when I am busy reading, etc. I blacked out the white Mr Coffee logo on mine so it remains entirely black except the orange light."
4,lived up to my expectations,"Mr Coffee beverage warmer is as good if not better then I expected. It keeps my coffee and tea as hot as I like it. For those who think it is not hot enough, who wants burned coffee? This warmer keeps my beverages at a nice hot temperature for as long as it takes me to drink them."
2,Luke Warm product,"I bought one of these for me, one for my wife. Neither kept the coffee warm-hot; more like lukewarm-tepid. Worse than that, they both cracked, after about 4 months. I've always thrown one of them away. I'm not impressed :(We're looking for new ones."
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this because my mug of coffee/tea gets cold while still being about half full. This solved the problem. It doesn't keep the contents as hot as when it's freshly poured, but hot enough to make large gulps uncomfortable. I would suggest this because it does the job and is priced very reasonably. I picked up an extra one for my desk at work."
1,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed,It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
4,Great product,"This thing works perfectly, it easily heats my mug up and keeps it warm for several hours, keeps my coffee fresh as the moment I poured it. Great gadget to have at your desk."
2,Mug Warmer....barely,"It does keep the mug warm. The coffee? That's a different story. My old warmer died after years of service. Apparently the lawyers became involved in the years between purchases. This warmer doesn't do the job but it probably won't generate any accidental burn lawsuits.""I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me."" -Banksy, street artist."
3,Fair But Not Great,"The warmer works fine, but it only does a fair job of keeping the beverage hot. I have an older (different brand) warmer that does a much better job of keeping my coffee hot. For the money though, it's not bad."
1,"Doesn't keep the coffee hot, don't bother trying this one.","I've read the reviews and disagree with most of them. The coffee will not stay hot, luke warm at best."
2,Not too impressed....,"I was hoping to find something that kept my coffee hot, but instead it just keeps it from getting cold. If I'm down to about a half inch to an inch of coffee in my cup, it gets hot. I will continue in my search for a coffee warmer...."
3,Doesn't fit oversized mugs,"This only fits a standard sized mug, wish it had a bigger surface. My over sized coffee cup sits on the rim of the warmer, still keeps my tea & coffee warm until I remove from heat or turn off. DON'T forget to turn off, not automatic."
3,Not so hot (literally),"I bought this to supplement an aging Salton Hot Spot model. The Salton worked okay, but I needed a second warmer. Unfortunately, the Mr Coffee produces disappointing results. Hot coffee becomes warm coffee on this unit. Being a forensic engineer, I was prompted to do some testing to determine what might be the problem.Both units were tested unloaded (i.e. with no cup), and then loaded with a ceramic mug filled with room temp water. Here are the stats:Salton: 23 watts, 260 deg-F unloaded temp, 245 degree with full cup.Mr. Coffee: 17 watts, 226 deg-F unloaded, 180 degree with full cup.So it appears that the Mr Coffee is a bit underpowered--it has a lower (albeit safer) starting temperature that can't be maintained under load. Once loaded, the surface temp is too low for useful heat transfer. Perhaps the Salton's design was guided by an engineer, while the Mr Coffee was guided by an attorney."
1,NOT HOT!,"I know it's called a beverage warmer, but it barely does that. I wouldn't recommend this at all. I had a cup warmer by Dazey (can't find it now) and it kept my drink HOT, as it should. I mean who wants a warm beverage, which this warmer barely does."
1,Doesn't Keep Coffee Hot,If you like your coffee or tea luke warm (which I don't) than maybe this is fine. I threw mine out.
3,Hot digitty!,"This is a replacement for a previous warmer that finally died after several years. It does an OK job of keeping my coffee warm, but not HOT which is what I would prefer. Keeping a lid on my mug helps. Next time, I think I will get a hot plate with a thermostatic control."
2,JUST PRETTY,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A BEVERAGE WARMER FOR MY HUSBAND. THIS ONE DOES NOT KEEP MY COFFEE HOT NOT EVEN WARM. I HAVE ONE WITH A CERAMIC BASE THAT I HAVE HAD FOR FIVE YEARS, SO I AM LOOKING FOR ONE OF THOSE. DON'T PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THIS PRODUCT.THE NAME MR. COFFEE JUST WON'T WORK ON THIS ITEM."
5,Must have for the office!,This has got to be one of the best office companions ever! It really does work! It does its job of keeping my coffee/tea warm. A very good buy and must have!
2,Don't buy it,"Don't buy this product. It keeps the liquid only tepid, not warm at all. The cozy warmer is much better as it keeps liquids warm. I bought this one because the on and off switch was easily accessible. Big mistake."
3,Disappointed,"While I like the fact that this warmer has a great longer cord and makes it much easier to use, I find it does not keep the liquid as warm as my last warmer. It is luke warm at best"
1,Safe?,"I recently purchased this mug warmer to keep my coffee warm while working at my desk. I plugged it in, turned it on and there was a *pop* sound, a spark, and then a little smoke. Nice idea and all but I'll take the trek to my microwave over a fire hazard."
3,Good for the price,It is good for simple warmer without temperature sensor or various size to chose from. Shipping to homw is quick and best way to shop small item like this.
3,A so-so cup warmer,"Keeps liquids only warm, not hot, and the underside of the unit gets quite warm. I don't know what sort of damage it might do to a wooden desktop over time, but I've put a trivet under mine just in case."
5,coffee mug warmer,"Ok, so I never finished my coffee before I got this since it always got cold. (Nothing like cold java on a winter's day with the a/c on in the office.) So, I gave this gadget a shot. If you are a coffee sipper like me and don't gulp your coffee in 2 minutes, this is the perfect product for you. It keeps hot cocoa, coffee, and tea and even cup-a-soups at the perfect sipping temperature.The only drawback is that once you are almost done with your drink, you must remember to turn off the switch. Can't blame the manufacturer, though. I forgot to shut mine off and a couple of hours later, my half a cup of coffee became a shot of espresso. Not so yummy."
2,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in this thing. I would say it needs an auto shut-off but it would be a waste of time and energy. This warmer keeps the bottom of the cup nice and warm but the liquid inside remains tepid. The warming surface is too small for my large, ceramic mug. The price was OK but I'm shopping for another. My advice, don't waste your money unless you want to warm anything larger than a demitasse."
1,Lukewarm coffee,"If you like your coffee at perfect drinking temperature -- DON'T BUY THIS. It's got a cord on it long enough to reach from one room to the next, but barely warms the cup at all. The base is also too small for most mugs."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT!,"I finally found a cup warmer that actually keeps my coffee hot! I have a very narrow threshold of how hot I like my coffee (piping hot, if it gets even remotely cooler, I can't stand it). This unit keeps it at nearly the optimal temperature.To further optimize my coffee temperature control, I bought a Titanium coffee mug from REI (very thin with great heat transfer) for about 30$. This set-up is perfect. I can walk away from my desk for any amount of time and return to a perfectly hot cup!You do have to start with a hot cup of joe to begin with though."
3,"Worked great, for a while","This worked great for about 4 months. Kept coffee warm, but not too hot. Perfect for me. I don't like being burned every time I take a sip. When there is about 1/3 a cup of coffee left, it will actually make it hotter, as opposed to all other times when it just seems to help hold the current temperature.Unfortunately, now mine seems to not want to heat up when I turn it on, unless I smack it against my desk a few times. Eventually, with some effort, I can get it to heat up again, but it's starting to be a pain. At this price though, I can't really complain. Probably will purchase another one to replace this ""touchy"" one I have."
2,"It turned on, so that is good","This ""Mug Warmer"" did not work very well. The warmer turned on, heating surface got hot, but did not create enough heat to keep my coffee hotter then lukewarm. Additionally, I had to down size from a Mug (Starbucks '92 Chicago Skyline) to a cup (blue) since my favorite mug wouldn't fit on the heating surface.I normally heat my mug in the microwave, fill 3/4 full with tap water, set on high for 2 minutes, 3 in the winter. Then dispense right into the cup from the Keurig which is set to 192 degrees, 10oz of liquid. In this case, I drank half and left the cup on the warmer.Upon my return, 30-40 minutes later, the coffee was not cold but saying it was warm would been an overstatement.I would have expected a little better from a Mr. Coffee branded Coffee ""Mug"" Warmer. On the other hand it was only $9.Get what you pay for, but I returned mine."
3,Not Warm Enough,"The warmer looks good, seems to be built sturdily, but barely keeps my coffee warm. It definitely needs to be piping hot for the warmer to keep beverage warm, and it kinda keeps it luke warm at that. Wish they would make a higher power version..."
5,Love it for my desk at work,"I got this for my desk at work so I could nurse my coffee without it getting cold. I love it. My coffee stays warm, and I see no signs of burning/damage on the bottom of my mug. My dad uses one at night for his tea while watching TV. A great gadget, especially for people who are hard to shop for.UPDATE: I've had this item for a year and half. I use it about 3x a week, and it still works great."
2,not happy,"I find this cup warmer only keeps my coffee lukewarm at most even starting with hot coffee. I work at the computer and when I stop to reach for my cup, I want hot coffee, so it was definitely a disappointment."
3,Works but ...,"As depicted on Amazon, Product Dimensions are supposed to be: 1.2 x 5.2 x 8.6 inches; 13.1 ounces. These are wrong. It turns out that the real dimensions are: 1.2, 3.6, 5.2 inches -- outside diameter is 5.2 inches and the heating element diameter is 3.6 inches. My mug doesn't fit on the heating element; I have to overlap. My drink over time is kept warm perhaps 105F (an estimate); I'd prefer perhaps 140F."
3,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,"This warmer is attractive in appearance and has an on/off switch. I do wish that the switch and light were not at the back. This is awkward and makes it easy to miss seeing the light is on, if a mug is in place. I'm also disappointed that the coffee is not kept as hot as I'd like. I have to cover the mug unless I drink it quite rapidly."
4,A handy and convenient computer accessory.,The Mr. Coffee Mug warmer is a handy and convenient accessory for both my computer workspace and on my bedside reading table.
3,Hot or Not,I received my Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer on time and it was packed very well. I have been using it everyday for my coffee. I would like if my coffee stayed a little hotter but this one is OK. I will keep looking for one that will keep my coffee as hot as it was when I first poured it.
1,Stopped working after one week.,"This desktop warmer worked great for one week. It kept my coffee at a nice temperature. However, after one week of use, it quit working completely."
1,Waste of money,"I agree with the others who have said this does little or nothing to keep a drink warm. Lukewarm is at best, and you still have to continue to reheat a beverage if you want it to be anything close to warm or hot."
5,Just what I needed at the office,I wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee I drank and realized one of the main reasons why I top-off is because it cooled down. Once I got my mug warmer I can now happily sip my cup of coffee throughout the day and it keeps it at just the right temperature. Not blazingly hot but just under that. I've been using it 5 days a week 10 hours a day for 2 months and it has been a solid performer.
2,Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer,"I gave one of the mug warmers to a friend and was told by her that the hot drink in the cup was not kept hot while on the warmer when it was turned on. So I tried the other warmer that I kept and it too does not keep the drink hot even if I had mircowaved the drink in that warmed up cup. I tested the temperature of my old warmer and the surfaces of the two Mr. Coffee warmers and had a difference of 50-75 Degrees higher on my old warmer. I used a ""Deluxe Infrared Therometer w/ Laser"" ""ATD- Advanced Tool Design "" Model ATD-701. I used is tool for mechanic and truck driving to check temperatures on the equipment and any frozen food or other products to watch for temperature varies."
2,fire hazard,"I replaced an old Betty Crocker warmer due to age (20 years) with this, ironically because I thought I may be pushing my luck with ancient wiring. The first time out of the gate, I left the house with the warmer on for hours...the on/off indicator light is so dim I can only see the glow if I cup my hand over the light to shade it. Scared me enough to pull my old one back out, it has an automatic shutoff that would have prevented my potentially dangerous oversight. And warms better anyway!"
4,Keep your beverage warm!,"Nothing is more annoying that leaving your coffee for a moment only to return to a cold cup of creamer n sugar. Some like it hot, i like it WARM! This product works great and lives up to it's name. It's very affordable and is an easy gift idea that just about anyone that drinks hot beverages would appreciate. It's been very good to me over the holiday season. The only downside is of course the cord, i mean im happy that you plug it in and it's not battery operated, but the cord can get in the way depending on where you place the warmer and can sometimes create a tripping hazard. Other than that, I'm down with this product. Don't you think it's time to warm YOUR mug?"
5,This has made my dreams come true.,"I am constantly having to make trips to the microwave to heat up my tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. I'm a slow drinker, I can't help it. I don't like to gulp my drinks I like to enjoy them. Sometimes for over an hour! And I have high temperature standards. I like my beverages borderline scalding. That being said, I had doubts that this little gadget would keep my beverages HOT (not warm). It does a great job. Other reviewers are correct in that it will not reheat cold beverages but if you put them on the warmer when they are already hot enough to your liking, it will keep it that way for hours. Highly recommend for any slow drinkers out there. Should have gotten one years ago.Update: it's also useful for keeping a small teapot with tea in it warm for hours. I have a little ceramic tea pot that holds maybe 3 cups of liquid. If you make sure the tea is extra hot when you put it in the pot, it will stay pretty warm for a long time."
4,Works Great!,Pleased with the how the coffee warmer works. Instead of taking a trip to the microwave half way through my morning cup I can now drink the whole thing nice and warm. Doesn't keep the coffee real hot but it does the job pretty nicely.
4,A nifty little product...,"A nifty little product that does just as its name suggests--it keeps hot liquids quite warm, down to the last drop so you don't end up having to drink cold coffee (or tea or cocoa) from your mug, ever.I like that the cord is long enough that I can safely scoot it out of the way, yet it remains plugged in--I previously bought another brand mug warmer which such a short cord that it was impractical to use, as the cord kept getting (accidentally) yanked out of the outlet. Not good.The red indicator light clearly informs you when the unit is on, and is easy to see. The warmer fits typical sized mugs, so can be used with just about any mug you happen to have. All in all, I highly recommend this upgrade to your hot drink experience."
4,like it !,Make sure you heat up your drink nicely before you put it on the warmer and your drink stays hot until you finish it.I like it.
1,1 time use only,"After the first use, unplugging the cable. while it was cooling down cracked voice raised then it's not heating again."
2,Not a great idea,"I think I paid $8 for this, so I figured for the price that I may as well try it. It's pretty useless, unless you want to make the mug so hot that you burn your hand, it doesn't heat the liquid inside. I used it once and threw it out and went back to my routine of letting my beverage get cold and then microwaving it."
5,Best of stays warmer coffee cup!,"Mr. Coffee had a very good warmer coffee on my mug cup. Before I bought it, I was usually my mug cup of coffee only warmer less than 10 min to become cold coffee, I was put it in a microwave to reheater mug cup then they went become cold after 15 mins. Now, I use a warmer heater which is stayed warmer till fill it up a coffee will stays warmer an hour, hour, hour forever is excellent it so much. I love it so much better than life without warmer."
5,He Loves it!,"I gave it to my boss for Christmas, his coffee was always getting cold because he's too busy to drink it right away. Now he always has a hot, hot cup of coffee.He Loves it!Kathy"
3,Too hot for my tastes - coffee tastes burnt,"I have some no-name brand warmer at home that keeps the coffee ""just right"" and wanted a warmer for work. How can you go wrong with ""Mr. Coffee""? So I bought this one.It works, no complaints on construction, but it just makes the coffee too hot, like it was in the pot on the warmer too long and tastes burnt/old. And that happens fairly quickly, within 20 minutes I'd say.To make it work, I put the cup a little to the side so it's lifted up on the case; only part of the mug hits the warmer."
2,Really disappointed,"I just received this little mug warmer and was hoping my days of cold-too-soon coffee were behind me. Alas, that's not the case. This unit barely does anything it seems. The bottom 1/8th of my mug stays warm, but the rest of it gets cold. The coffee may stay SLIGHTLY warm (a hair above tepid) for a bit longer than it used to, but it doesn't keep it anywhere close to as warm as it is when it comes out of the pot (or spout, since I use a Keurig). I have to put my hand very close to the burner - almost touching it - just to make sure it's producing any heat at all. It gets two stars because at least it's cheap. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, though."
3,Mug warmer with caveat...,"This will keep your tea/coffee WARM - but as others have mentioned the mug shape makes a difference. Use a mug with a bottom that makes contact with as much of the warmer as possible, and it will do a decent job. If you want something with more power...then spend more money :)"
4,Salvation from cold coffee..,"One thing about me - I get distracted easily. Usually by the phone, or pretty, shiny articles on the interwebs .. this has a tendency to cause my morning Joe to go tepid very quickly.One evening, as I watched Netflix streaming on my main monitor whilst surfing eBay daily deals on my iPad, I noticed a mug warmer. It was the perfect solution! Not being foolish enough to buy something on eBay without research, I marked it to follow up. And, hey! Guess what!? On the daily deal, it was STILL more expensive than here on Amazon, and that particular model's reviews sucked out loud! However, this dandy little Mr. Coffee mugwump - er, mug warmer - just arrived yesterday and it's AWESOME.This morning, I got my mug settled into it's little spot and - WOWZAH! The coffee stays hot(ish)!The thing doesn't heat the mug to an uncomfortable temperature, and it sure slows down the normal Newtonian heat transfer rate. Four stars!!!"
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in the Mr. coffee cup warmer. My coffee is really hot when I first put it on however on theMr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm. I can't stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion. Don't waste your money. Why can't they make a good coffee cup warmer? I am still looking
4,"Nice, hot coffee!",I bought 1 for home and 1 for work. Love them both! Start with hot drink and enjoy for 5-7 hrs. I take hot coffee to work in a thermos and refill my mug as needed. Great inexpensive gift for co-workers. Watch the liquid level carefully though; it gets very hot if the amount of liquid gets really low.
2,Would Not Recommend,Bought this for my wife to replace an old cup warmer she had that died. She was totally disappointed with the product. It was not effective at keeping coffee in her mug warm.
1,Does not work as described in reviews,"I bought this over the lower priced version, based on reviews of people who were very happy with it. I was disappointed from day 1. It actually arrived in the mail and looked as though it was a return from someone else, as the plastic was lightly scratched on the surface.I turned it on and used it with a cup of fresh HOT coffee and it only stayed at a WARM temperature. This only kept my coffee slightly warm, right about the temperature you would go refill your coffee because it's getting cold.I will be returning this product."
3,Gets way too hot.,This is more a coffee boiler than warmer. Don't your coffee/tea on this for long unless you like that cooked taste. And it WILL heat up cold coffee -- within 10 minutes or so. I actually burned my finger by touching the hot portion of this. This makes me worry about its potential as a first hazard.This also is quite large and takes up a lot of desk real estate.I'm setting off to find a safer and smaller alternative!'
3,"Not the best Thomas book, but okay","I bought this book based on the reviews I saw listed, but I wasn't terribly impressed with it. It's okay, just not great."
2,What a rip off!,Three criticisms:1. The narrator didn't explain the phenomenon of Waterpocket Fold.2. $3.00 for ten minutes!3. Cheesy coloration.
4,Several old Kornbluth works finished by Pohl,"Ten stories spanning nearly twenty years of one of the finest collaborations in the history of science fiction. Pohl plus Kornbluth was a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Three of the ten stories were begun by Kornbluth, and finished by Pohl after his partner's tragic early demise.Contents:Best Friend (1941Critical Mass (1961The Engineer (1955)A Gentle Dying (1961)Marstube (1941)Nightmare With Zeppelins (1958)The Quaker Cannon (1961)Trouble in Time (1940)The World of Myrion Flowers (1961)"
3,Low to medium quality SF,"The stories in this collection are well below the pinnacle this pair set in several of their other collaborations. Two of the early stories in particular, Marstube and Trouble In Time, are pure adolescent space opera, while the other early story, Best Friend, is not much more than a sketch. The later stories pack more of a punch, although the longest one, Critical Mass, promises more than it delivers. Only for completists who must have everything this duo wrote."
2,Westmoreland Identification & Value Guide,I was very disappointed in this book. I collect Westmoreland Milk Glass - primarily the grape panel pattern. There was very little in this book on milk glass. A true Westmoreland Glass book would have a great bit of it in there.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points, but extremely weak on others. It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should. I would NOT recommend Kovar's books on any subject."
5,Why in the world isn't this writer/director world famous?,"This is a wonderful movie, and to think it is a debut film. Man. I had seen ""The Magdalene Sisters"" twice,and loved it so much that I looked up the director, found this movie, and ordered it on Netflix. It startsoff sort of slow, but gathers speed and intensity, and winds up a home run. This writer/director shouldbe working. His NOT working robs me of pleasure. Mr. Mullan, if ever you check these things (and I knowfamous people sometimes do), for the love of God get off your rump and get to work. If you drink stop. Ifyou drug it, stop. If you're just plain lazy, get some gumption. If you've been this good on your first twofilms, you could be a world-beater.Get back to work. Please. (And the actors are great, down to the tiniest part. Just dynamite stuff all around)."
5,The accent rocks!,"This movie makes great audio. I can't wait for Scottish Independence so we can see kilts in the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony parade. But until then, England should include a Scottish audio option on all their movies and television program(me)s. This movie comes with English subtitles. The first part is reminiscent of After Hours and the ending is a peaceful one."
4,If you don't love the Scots...,"Being a fan of Peter Mullan, I wanted to see this -- I think his first directing effort. It's hard to take, more than a little over the top -- but in the end, it is incredibly moving and a remarkable work."
1,Ugh,I read four chapters and put the book up for sale without finishing it. Why do some of these romance writers think it endears us to their heroes and heroines for them to be dumber than dirt? And why do they think it's funny to repeat the same thing over and over and over?Ugh. I got rid of Bradley...and Cruisie as an author I'll pick up and read.
4,Modern Entry in Fantasy Romance,"With a heavy helping of humor, Jennifer Crusie treats the reader to a fun and witty escapist romance. No, it's probably never going to happen this way, but it's fun, it's charming, and the dogs will warm your hearts too. The Lucy character manages to be smart, cute, sassy and independent, which is a big improvement over some of the lame ladies in romantic fiction. Zach, as the macho policeman, is a bit much but able to be taught. Crusie also allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments. This book might just be the answer for a cold winter evening."
3,"Loved the characters, plot not so stellar","Of all the Crusies I've read so far, this one had the weakest plot, in my opinion. Still a fun read."
3,Mildly Amusing,"I can see by these reviews that there are a lot of huge Jennifer Crusie fans out there and if you are one of them, you'll probably love this book. This is the second Crusie novel I have read (after Welcome to Temptation) and it runs along the same formula as the first. This is an engaging, quick read--some romance, a little mystery, some mild humor, but nothing, in my view, spectacular. Still, though, I can see that many readers love Crusie's work, and if that's you, I think you will enjoy this novel. She's just not someone I can rave about (but I will keep reading her novels when I come across them)."
4,Getting rid of Bradley,I enjoyed the book once I got over the readers voice. The book was exciting and fun to listen to i alway enjoy Jennifer cruise books.
2,Really... get rid of Bradley...,"The ONLY reason I am giving this book a MARGINAL 2 stars is because it is entertaining in how bad it is. The plot is contrived, the characters are one sided and annoying and the writing is wretched. And no... it's not even funny. I didn't even crack a grin.But probably the biggest annoyance with the book is how annoying the characters itself are. Lucy tries so desperately to assert her ""independence"" it's irritating... and the bad boy sexy mytery cop? The whole mid-life crisis thing made him not so mysterious... and defiantly not sexy...Honestly there were times when I had to stop reading in the middle of a chapter and just walk away because it just raditated with... stupidity.If you want to read about a smart, funny airhead, with not one but TWO sexy men than please check out Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series.Trust me, you're wasting your time by reading the title."
2,Reads as a rush job,"This book was a disappointment in comparison to other Crusie books. Her books were my first foray into contemporary romance. The plot is not too developed or very interesting for that matter. And the main characters, they come off pretty flat."
5,Thank you Jennifer!,This was the first book by Jennifer Crusie that i have read and i just loved it. i had got hold of this book on a very 'bad day'. I was very depressed. it was not easy to make me laugh but this book did it. i laughed out loud... and it felt very good! As from now Crusie is my favorite romance writer. Thank you jennifer for writing this book!
4,Nice..,"It was a very cute story but I personally prefer ANYONE BUT YOU over this story. The character Zack in this story is a bit rough around the edges for me. Although at the end he did soften up a lot, but I felt his character was very rough. However it was a nice, humorous story, and it does keep the reader interested through out the plot."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as the author's other books.","Something was repetitive and a little boring about the conversations during the first third of the book. This was one of the author's first books and it wasn't as good as her later books. I was annoyed that Lucy kept saying she didn't believe she was being shot at and that she was in danger, even though a bullet hit her cheek, and a bomb went off in her car. She went out for a jog and to a beauty parlor when she should have stayed home where she had police protection. There were a few humorous lines, but I'd recommend skipping this book unless you're a die-hard Crusie fan. It was ok, but not what I was used to from her. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: one. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 1994. Genre: mystery romance."
4,Loved it!!!,"I'm a recent Jennifer Crusie fan, and am working on reading all her ""old"" books. I love her! Her writing is top, and she keeps it realistic enough to be believeable, but humorous too. This was one of her earlier books from the Harlequin ""Temptation"" line, and we can see what appears to be Harlequin holding her back in someways. ""Getting Rid of Bradley"" isn't as funny as some of her earlier works. It feels like she's following the rules laid down by Harlequin. However, despite this, it allows her voice to come through. From Lucy with the green hair to the end.. top writing that only gets better!"
3,Getting Rid of Lucy!!,"Is what this book should really be called. Overall, this book is fast paced and a fun read. The hero, Zach, is definitely worth the read but what spoiled the book for me was that Lucy was a complete ditz. For a woman who is a physics teacher and lives by logic and reason, she certainly lacked common sense. Every time Zach called her a ""dummy,"" I found myself nodding in agreement.If you don't mind a clueless heroine in an otherwise entertaining story, than read this book. It will take all of a day and you do get some laughs out of it. But if those types of heroines frustrate you, then skip this book and read ""Manhunting,"" which is a far superior book that Crusie wrote in her early years."
4,Great romantic humor,"I will admit to being a bit overwhelmed in the beginning since it jumped in with all these characters and all this action, but it did not take me long to settle down comfortably in the plot. I adored how Crusie allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments. The characters had a wonderful blend of humor, intelligence, and chemistry. Also, the plot was interesting and had a few twists and turns, but nothing that seemed outlandishly implausible."
3,Cute and enjoyable,"This one was not nearly as raunchy as some of the others I've read by her (notably, Welcome to Temptation) and was vastly more enjoyable. Though the characters were a bit unbelievable and there were a few aspects of the story that seemed a stretch, the overall plot was pretty straightforward, and she even included enough clues that you could, at times, be ""ahead of"" the characters. Plus, how can you dislike a main character that loves dogs that much?!?"
4,getting rid of bradly,This book was entertaining and funny. I recommend this book. It was easy reading and didn't want to put the book down.
4,So glad i didn't give up on crusie quite yet...,"This is definitely one of her better reads. It has a hint of mystery to it, and not to much of her love making writing...."
2,A little rushed,The story line is the typical Crusie formula but plot was weak and felt rushed. Characters fall for each other almost immediately and without reason so the tension between them is lacking in comparison to her other books.
2,"same old, same old","I've read a number of Crusie books, and the first few were enjoyable enough fluff, but then they all started to blend together. This was no differetn The stories and characters are WAY too similar book to book, right down to the physical descriptions and situations they find themselves in, the secondary characters, the settings, and even the way it all ends up.Also, I listened to this on audio book, and for the life of me can't figure out why the narrator assigned Lucy's sister a Staten Island-ish accent. If they're sisters who grew up together, why would one have that accent and the other not? It was so stupid it was distracting!"
5,Magick for REAL people!!!,"This is a great book...It's filled with a hundred spells from various cultures, religions and traditions that work independent of any specific culture, religion or tradition. What's wonderful about it, is that Draja focuses on making magick PRACTICAL. How refreshing! A lot of the spells are simple to perform and require items that are easily available to most people. There are a few spells that i find to be rather peculiar or overly time-consuming, but they're an interesting read at the least. He provides practical spells for most of the situations that people encounter in their daily lives...money, health, jobs, luck, relationships, etc. He does have a slight paternal tone in telling people not to alter the spells, but i take that to simply be a guardrail for the novice magick user. It's a great little sourcebook for spells and as inspiration to help you create your own. Definately a ""must-have"" for me! =))"
5,"Definite ""thumbs up""","An excellent little collection of spells. Not wicca or CM, so if you're looking for those you might be more pleased with some other selection. But it's good solid folk magic, largely of a mixed African and European flavor.I wouldn't say the book is indispensable for the advanced or intermediate practitioner. It's largely addressed at the beginner. But it's a pleasant read, well organised, and contains more useful practical spells than most books on the market these days.I definitely class it as a good value, especially at the price."
2,Ehhh =/,"To be honest I didn't really like this book, it doesn't really have spells just chants and potions and stuff, I would recommend buying somethine else."
4,It was very informative.,This particular piece of literature would be a great reference guide to someone who was well experienced in the art however this is not the type of book that a beginner would want. It is almost all just a listing.
4,very good spells and literature wow!,very good book. This book deals with spiruality and goes to the Christian aspect of magic. It is all very good reading and I haven't tried any spells yet but it is very interesting how Draja wrote this book. I highly recomend book to any one intressed in magic and it is good for reference it looks like.
4,A useful reference guide,"As always, Draja's work is comprehensive and thorough. In this book Draja doesn't so much supply spells as he supplies information about types of spells with some examples. What I found useful about this book is that it serves as a ready made reference guide that a person can draw on if s/he wants to use types of spells. This is a good book to have. It's not Draja's best, but its useful for whatever circumstances the magician might need."
2,might be good... if I could stay awake!,"It seems like a large company produces these videos (probably in the 70's or 80's) but it I still can't believe that this is part of a series! Is seems like someone made them in their basement. I can't attest to whether there is really great sewing info in it, because I can't force myself to keep watching it.The woman is reading from a script like a first grader that just finished hooked on phonics. Extremely monotonous tone, I can't stand to watch her and I keep falling asleep... really falling asleep!Other people had mentioned how boring it was, but I didn't think boring mattered if I just wanted sewing info. Boy, was I wrong.The other goofy thing they do is start ""showing"" you how to read the back of a pattern package, but then they forget to zoom in on it so you can't even see what they are pointing to.Why so much money? This video should be a $10 movie (or less)"
4,Great sewing guide for beginners.,"When I purchased this tape I knew nothing about sewing,only how to thread the machine which my mother actually did for me.But I really wanted to learn how to sew and this video has helped me so much.I learned how to read a pattern which I had thought was impossible,how to lay out the fabric and cut it, and then there is the sewing which she actually shows you at the machine.I really love this tape.It has started me on the wonderful world of sewing.If you really are a green beginner then this tape is for you.I even completed the skirt and it looks great.Highly recommended."
2,what you will need to begin to sew,"Boring, speaker very unenthusiastic, not enough sewing information"
1,Boring and hard to watch/listen,Waste of money. I purchased all 7 and gave them away. Hard to watch.
4,Bittersweet Surrender!,"Girl with a Suitcase: Ah, first love can be so bittersweet.....Violent Summer: Bittersweet! No one does it like Zurlini."
5,Good deal,Purchased this for my 2000 Windstar; price was about 40% cheaper than local parts store for same item. Have had no issues at all with this.
5,Kare Kano RULES!,"This is one of the best animes, I believe, so far in the history of anime. Kareshi Kanojo No Jijou (His and Her Situation) [...] It opens with the begining ""warning"" music and then leads straight to the opening song. Then it has several tracks of BEAUTIFUL instrumental music. The next actual vocal song you hear is the ""S.O.S"" song. I think that's one of my favorites because of the situation they played it in on the show.(When Arima huged Miyazawa) KAWAII! Then you have more breath taking music. The next ""song"" is a song (dunno what it's called) about monsters that all of Miyazawa's new friends sing. My favorite part is when Tsubasa shouts out. I crack up every time I hear it! Then you have both versions of the ending theme song. But if you have a chance to get this CD, it's totally worth it! Not to mention the cover artwork is very cool. It features evrybody. *-* Ja'ne! ~Aya-chan"
5,This is a great little CD,I was really pleased after purchasing this CD. Had heard Derryl in person a couple of times and thought he was good. His CD shows his versatility and there wasn't one tune I didn't love. He is also a great performer.
1,Horrible!,"If I tell the whole horrible story I could right a book, but I'll give the run down on this deal:1st TV: went out 2 hours after it arrived (Sept 2006)2nd TV: didn't work the day we got it (Dec 2006)See the time difference in trying to get a TV that works and we never got one??? This has been a nightmare and finally Polaroid has agreed to refund our money for this mess! Thank goodness for Corporate managers!!! Try to steer clear from the refurbs, if you want my advice."
3,Not bad but...,"This was pretty good and i will use it as a reference, but i was a little frustrated with the book. Throughout almost the entire middle section instead of answering very important questions on the topic of the chapter, he would just say ""check with your great dane mentor for information on...."" - feeding, bloat, purchasing, etc, etc etc. I got this book to get this guys opinion not for him to tell me to check with someone else. I did think that the sections on training were good."
3,Informative and a quick read,"A good, easy to read overview of the Great Dane. Enjoyed it. Helped me prepare for being a first time Dane owner, and left me with a very good idea of what to expect."
5,Fantastic combo of Rocksteady originals & U-Roy toasting,This double CD is fantastic value. The second CD is the best rocksteady compilation I have heard so far: lots of Paragons classics. The first CD is about the best intro to U-Roy you could buy and as he is the granddaddy of DJ toasting a good place to start. As there are nearly 30 tracks on each disc this adds to the value. The only doubt you might have is that it can sometimes be a bit wearing to listen to a whole disc of a single DJ's toasting. But hey! You could play the rocksteady disc all day long and never tire of it!
2,"Baby Loves It, But I Don't","This book is a series of photos depicting a baby and a grandpa sharing an activity such as painting or eating. My two-year-old daughter loves going through page by page and naming each activity. My problem is that, except for one Asian, all of the babies and grandpas are white. It doesn't reflect the ethnic mix of America at all. I don't want my daughter assuming that all grandpas look the same. It bothers me every time we read it."
4,Snowboard Park Tycoon,Great game and lots of fun. I was impressed with graphics and game play. It is well worth the price.
5,Sturdy Bench,"I am 6'1"". This bench is a very good fit. It feels sturdy and stable when lifting. There is a good span between the uprights to ensure your hands don't hit when replacing the bar. It was easy to assemble. I have decided to remove the leg lift, but it was not in the way. The padding is comfortable and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this bench for a daily workout."
2,Holes drilled incorrectly,Aside from missing a few bolts I also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly. I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem. This is as far as I have gotten in the assembly as I have ran out of daylight. I am sure when it is finally together it will be a 3/5 bench as opposed to my current 2/5 rating. The shipping went well as It got here on time.
5,Great bench for the money,"I bought this bench for my husband as a gift. I'm pretty impressed with the sturdiness so far. It took me over 2 hours to assemble by myself and there were a couple errors in the instructions but nothing I couldn't figure out pretty easily. Overall, a fantastic bargain. He was thrilled."
5,Useful and Engaging Review Book,"As an educational consultant who advises kids about finding and applying to New York City schools, I frequently recommend this top Sci High prep book. Arak, the author and a longtime Princeton Review instructor, writes engagingly, and explains to students exactly what they need to know to improve their scores on this competitive test. As a classroom teacher as well as a graduate of another selective public school (Hunter), Arak knows his material. eglickman@abacusguide.com"
5,"Yoko Kanno,you're the greatest!!!","I just got to say that one of the reasons Macross Plus and Cowboy Bebop succeded were not only because they are great anime but because of their great music score.Yoko Kanno is a master in composing any great song.She uses an unique and unrealistic language in most of them though(That's the reason I like After in the Dark and Pulse so much,it's all about emotions)U just won't believe it till u finally listen to it.I haven't been able to buy it though,I can't find it anywhere(Amazon.com got it though ^^)but I'd listen to every single song on the internet and all of them are great."
5,Thanks,Thank you for answering my questions and sending the product in a timely manner as it was described to me.
3,For class,"Many of the practice questions were easy, but some didn't make any sense, luckily the professor didn't grade on whether questions were right or wrong. In the end the book did it's job: A- for the class."
3,Statistics For The Novice,This book is terrific for someone who has no knowledge of statistics. It offers s student the opportunity to grasp statistical concepts easily.
2,Stats Class Workbook,"The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software, but only to send it back. I need the workbook for my class, and the class is in its fourth week. I have since ordered the software from the manufacturer.Jim McShane"
2,Interesting ideas poorly communicated,"Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure. His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery. In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience. The book really needs to go back to an editor."
1,Dangerously flawed,"Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy."
5,Brink of time= best vgmusic i have ever heard,"The brink of time add on cd to the chrono trigger osv was better than the original itsself. The orchestration by yasunori mitsuda was simply amazing, he truly is a master of vgmusic. I would in all ways say he is equal to or better than N. Umetsu (final fantasy). This is a truly captivating cd."
1,This is THE BRINK OF TIME. shame on ... for not tel,"its not that bad, but it is just nbot chrono trigger and it doesnt keep the feel of the chrono trigger music. BEWARE of this cd, i only ordered it because I though it was th OSV, WHICH IT IS NOT."
5,Best season yet!,"My daughter and I have been watching all the seasons together. After season 8, we were feeling done with the series but couldn't quite let go. Are we ever glad we didn't! This was an action packed season and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Great show,"This show lasted for 10 seasons! It was a little silly, but I believe that was intentional. Tom Welling will forever be my favorite Superman! He's the perfect choice. The package arrived on time and in good condition."
3,Worth a look?,"This round might be better for the casual viewer if only because so many other characters like ""Hawkman"" were introduced, that and the battles between Clark and Zod. Some good extras too, I guess."
3,The Series is Losing Its Appeal,"I love this series, however the ninth season gets bogged down with conspiracy. The actors are all still beautiful, which makes the plot lines forgivable. If you've followed the whole series, as I have, this is a must watch season. You have to find out what happens, and then complete the experience with the tenth and final season."
5,Love it.,"Buy all seasons for $9.99 each and save about $50 compared to buying the ""complete collection"". Just search each season and look for the $9.99 version. It's the same as the complete collections, but cheaper."
1,smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number),Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
1,upset,NEVER even got my order now they are telling me it is no longer available yeah season 9 of smallville dont think I will be ordering from amazon again!!!!
3,smallville season 9,"We have just started to watch this series and the content is fairly exciting, we are only on to the 3rd disk and are finding in these 3 that there are a few pink lines running through each one constantly, am wondering if it is because it is region 1 and we are playing it on a multi region dvd player?"
2,Smallville,"I have a strong connection with excellent speed. The show stopped at least 4 times due to signal disruption. I have no problems with connection at any other time. When the video did play, the video was high-def half of the time. I purchased high-def, but it was not good sound or video quality. The price and availability are the advantages."
1,Picture is way off...,"The faces in the close ups are cut halfway so you basically only see their eyes and you miss a lot of stuff happening in the scenes. I love the show. This is a rating on the quality of the video playback, Not the show."
2,bad review,It was so low that I could not hear it.I turned my volume up as loud as I could get it but still had toreally listen to get what was going on. also very dark . I loveSmallville & had watched it last night on t.v. but still did notenjoy this cause I could not hear it.
2,Not a family movie anymore!,"Superman use to be a family movie set for the young adults.You are now sending the wrong message to the young adults by adding sex to your movie.Know you have changed it to an adult movie.We buy these kinds of movies for the whole family and now you have lost my interest, by doing the wrong things."
1,Smallville ninth season,This is the 2nd time I have received this product and it still doesn't work ... All others do ... I will have to send it back
4,Smallville DVD 9th season,"I have been watching the Smallville series since season one! The ninth season was not packaged as nice as some of the previous seasons, but the new DVDs are nice and clear to watch. I know there is a season ten, but I also can feel the series is coming to an end. It was nice while it lasted. Ms Mack has been with the series from the start. I loved the part where she could heal people with her touch. She seems like a very nice girl - I wonder what she is actually like?"
5,Smallville Rocks!!!!!!!,"The condition was awesome, the price definately nice and all the inserts were there. I would definately trust these guys as far as condition goes. Very timely shipping as well before the stated recieve date. Thanks!"
5,Great Customer Service!,Amazon's customer service was beyond wonderful when contacted for this specific item. They worked with me to make sure I was treated fairly and to make sure I was happy. I will definitely continue to shop with Amazon for this particular reason!
5,birthday gift,I am always satisfied with this show. I get a season every birthday and Christmas for my brother. Thankfully I'm almost to the end of the list. He really loves the extra footage and interviews.
3,Ehh,"This episode was really corny, but it wasn't awful. I always love when they bring in other DC characters. The wonder twins were very campy, but that kinda how they always are anyhow. Erica (Lois) acting was a little bit weak in this one. This vision thing is a bit strange but overall an alright episode."
1,Yep it's a Zombie episode,"Spoiler alert there are zombies everywhere. This was a lame attempt at a scary story, but yes Clark and Lois have a moment... again. Don't worry though this moment will be forgotten in the next episode like it always is. Oh and Green Arrow is on drugs, which is kinda interesting because he went through a drug phase in the comics after he started killing people. Though Ollie in Smallville mostly just very angsty and self-centered right now. Smallville once and awhile has some good writers get to do some very interesting plot lines but this isn't one of them."
1,The Other review was wrong,I am sorry Smallville but all those touching moments don't make up for you having some terrible writers most of the time. So yeah this episode has a moment in the end but yeah its also not worth watching. Just move on to the next.
5,Wondertwin Powers... Activate!,"Awesome episode if you know who the wonder-twins are. They even had the monkey, mistakes, and really good intentions. I kept waiting for one of them to say how they wanted to be ""super friends"" with Clark or Chloe."
2,Smallville Season 9 - Faulty disc,"Purchased the Smallville Season 9 Blu-ray set from Amazon. When playing disc 4 there is a fault which freezes the picture. While the Season 9 set, up to then was excellent, the faulty disc totally ruined the viewing experience, hence the awarding of a lower than deserved rating."
3,Liked 1 thru 8 Better,I didn't watch this series when it was on t.v. My husband was a big fan. He likes to watch shows together. We have watched the complete series of Enterprise and Babylon 5. Both of which I loved. I surprised myself at how much I liked Smallville. I thought I would be put-off by the high school theme but wasn't at all. I was over Lana Lang and Lex Luthor and was glad when they were written out of the show (about a season too late in my opinion). I don't like the Zod story line at all. Season 9 is too dark for Superman. I like story lines with Green Arrow and Aquaman.
4,"A ""Have to See"" Series!","Best season out of all of them in my opinion. If you're not a fan of super hero comics, Smallville will definitely change your mind!"
5,<3 Smallville <3,"I love my movie. I can't wait till I own the whole collection, which should be very very soon. You could say I'm Smallville obsessed."
2,smallville season 9,needs to be better packaged. it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
2,Disapointed,"I recieved the product in a timley manner but when i played the discs they skipped and there was distortion on the screen, mixed up pixels. Im not sure if it was the DVDs or my DVD player although the rest of my DVDs play ok.."
3,Smallville Season 9,Good but not great. Smallville has a tendency to go off on irrelevent tangents. It also spends much to much time getting to the point.
5,Smallville,I've got all of the Smaville seasons and have enjoyed them all. I'm disappointed that the show is ending. I like the characters and the plots.
5,Golden Earrings,"One of the better WWII romantic movies, one of my 3 favorites. It has excitement, surprise, romance, mystery. Everything that makes a great war story!!! Miss Marlene & Mr. Ray are at their best!"
5,Delightful!,"If you enjoy acting and song, this is a must! Marlene's superb acting delighted me through the whole movie. She was enchanting and endearing as this Gypsy character. The gravity of the war times was made easier to watch. If you've not seen this please do settle down for a very enjoyable fun time with these wonderful characters and music."
5,Quick Delivery. Quality Replacement Part.,"The replacement battery cartridge arrived a day early, was in great condition, and contained APC batteries as described. As a busy Network Administrator, receiving the correct replacement part as described and a day early is the best case scenario. Thank you."
1,Misrepresented Product,"As advertised, the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts. When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from ""ABC"" (manufactured in Vietnam). The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts. This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last."
4,Brown doesn't deserve the Credit,"Reviews about ""head wounds"" are complete trash, von Richtofen was clearly shot from below and to the right, putting him perfectly within range of the Aussies on the ground...no way could Brown have shot up at him coming from behind and above.Furthermore, had von Richtofen gotten nailed by a fatal head wound then he would not have been conscious to have said the last word ""Kaput"" to the Aussies who approached his downed machine.He was killed by a single bullet through the right side entering the chest diagonally upward with the slug exiting his left breast. Get off this ""Brown got him"" garbage, all he got was a short burst off then he skedaddled before his luck was pushed."
3,von Richthofen & Brown,"Great video for WW1 aircraft and flying scens the names of the flyers are real other than that, more fiction than non=fiction. John phillp Law's Brown a Bit overacted. But great air scenes worth the buy for that."
4,Good depiction of WW1 air war,"For the war buff only. Outstanding flying scenes, even if some of the aircraft types are wrong. John Phillip Law is good as Von Richtofen, though too tall. The Baron was a small man. Don Stroud portrays Roy Brown as sort of a cowboy. Brown was an officer and a gentleman. American actors don't play Canadians well. If you like the flying, I highly recommend Howard Hughes' film 'Hell's Angels' (1930). As real as it gets!"
2,The worst movie I've ever seen about these 2 great pilots,"too phoney, lots of errors in the way the movie was made, also bad lip syncing from the woman singer, they played them off as ruthless killers when in fact all other stories tell otherwise. One part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying, but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top."
3,Another Might Have Been,"What a shame. Life and death combat in gasoline powered kites, heroic personalities and nostalgia of a dramatic time were rendered uninteresting by wooden performances and mediocre costuming. See The Blue Max instead. Its German pilots are also all inaccurately kitted out in Uhlan uniforms but at least its story is more compelling and the acting is better. And Usula Andress is not hard to watch either. Someday maybe HBO will do this right. Until then, it's pretty much these two movies and ""Dawn Patrol""."
2,It's no longer the worst movie on the subject,"Quite aside from the historical gaffes-- which are many and well documented by others-- it's a really lousy movie because the characters are so clumsy. Everyone is nasty to everyone else. Bad attitudes pass for 'drama.'I thought it was the worst movie on the subject of all time, but have recently seen the newer ""The Red Baron."" While that movie has much nicer airplanes, it has its own long list of historical absurdities-- I think it 'wins' the race to fairy tale.But on top of that, the dialogue is so silly and the editing so chopped up that you can't even follow the storyline.So ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" is only the 2nd worst movie on the subject. Still awful."
1,Who did shoot down the Red Baron? The other side of the coin - in fairness.,"To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey ""Kilby"" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the ""Red Baron."" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."
1,Von Richtofen & brown,"This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."
3,Very complete but poorly printed Bravo collection.,"The most complete collection of this wonderful photographer's work available, this book has unfortunately been printed so poorly that the qualities of most of the photographs is lost. The photos look muddy and suffer from low contrast. The essay, however, is excellent, and worth reading for an introduction to Bravo's life and work. The Aperture books of Bravo's work, while offering far fewer photographs, have much better reproduction."
3,Nice,"Bracelet was nice and as described. Clasp is hard to work and stones have very little purple color. However, I think it is a fair value."
1,Amethyst sterling bracelet,"This is made OK. The stones are washed out, no color. Purchased for gifts but will not give them as it will embarrass me. I would have returned them but I was traveling and missed the deadline."
3,"Great movie, but lack of widescreen version a rip-off.","OK, so I've read all the reviews and I agree with all of them. This movie is simply beautiful. I pre-ordered this gem the day it was announced. BUT, imagine my surprise when it came in Standard version only! Even Amazon.com advertises it as a widescreen disc in several places. Gaah! So this disc loses two stars from me. One for false advertising (yep, even the Image preview said 'Widescreen'), and one for the stupid decision in the first place. They already had the re-mastered letter-boxed Laser disc, so its not as if they 'couldn't do it'. Especially since the same company released and incredible widescreen-enhanced Fiddler on the Roof the SAME DAY. Anyway, I've said my piece. If you never plan to buy a 16x9 TV and dislike the 'black bars' found on letter-boxed editions, buy this disc. Otherwise, don't support this nonsense. Wait for the Criterion (well there SHOULD be)."
5,Excellent music and movie,"The film has a nice flow and plot. The music is great. It is all geared toward the Italian familia. I love Cher, Nicholas Cage, and Olivia Dukacas in it. They gave great performances. I already loved La Boheme prior to seeing the movie and bought the CD of the movie soundtrack. Anyone wanting to see an enjoyable movie and listen to great music should put this high on your list. It is entertaining and holds your interest, unlike a lot of other movies. It used to be a 4-star movie and is now rated a 3-star movie - but a high 3-star. It is a classic that will be viewed over and over. The music of Puccini will live forever. Once you see the movie, the music flows from scene to scene in your mind.A must buy CD."
1,Viewer from NY,I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
4,letterbox on TCM,"wonderful movie. if you can stand the chopped format, get it. If you want letterbox, tape it (December 2003) from TCM. Or look for the rumored widescreen DVD version. (Why they ever made a chopped version for DVD, I'll never understand...)"
1,Where's the letterbox?,"Like other reviewers, I'm baffled as to why this is not in letterbox. I can live without super-duper extras, but I have no reason to upgrade from my VHS until a widescreen version is published. The rating is reflective of my dislike of the fullscreen formatting. The movie itself is one of the great romantic comedies-a love letter to love itself, and NYC."
2,Why isnt this movie in Widescreen?,This is a fantastic movie....I would buy it in a second...all those features and commentary sound wonderful but I wont buy this DVD until it comes out widescreen.
2,Blu ray wouldn't play,"I have a toshiba Blu ray player that's a year old and this Blu ray DVD would not play in my player because it's so new and apparently a 1 year old Blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs $40. So now I'm reluctant to buy Blu rays. I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now. I gave this DVD to a friend and I'm sure it's fine, so just don't get it unless you have a new Blu ray player."
5,Good experience,"I received this is great condition and early! No problems whatsoever. Also, the price was very reasonable. I would order from this vendor again."
5,Brilliant,This is my 10th time screening this incredible movie and now I have the option of buying it in DVD. Bravo toCher and Norman Jewison and Ms. Dukakis
5,Moonstruck is terrific,"Moonstruck is one of the best gems that's been on the screen---ever. Cher, Nick Cage, Danny Aiello, Olympia Dukakis all put in great performances in this Brooklyn romance, set in today's world, but timeless in it's tale of love. A true romantic comedy with some pricelss one liners in it. And all the time, the wonderful music of Puccini in the background. A must see. END"
5,Sophistication Under The Moonlight,"Yes dear viewer, Moonstruck provides the most sophisticated elements of a good movie could offer. A great story, excellent performers and the fabulous music of Puccini. END"
5,Humor and Melancholy and Surprise,"A full cycle of emotions while watching real artists deliver their craft. Cher is beautiful, humorous and devilish while themen in her life complicate it and compliment it."
3,Don't know what to say!,"Got this as a Christmas gift for somebody who loves this movie - let's hope this DVD version is not edited. We watched this film the other night and a couple of scenes were deleted probably because of ""time"" constraints. So, let's hope this is 100 percent okay."
1,DVD Quality,The first disc was defective. Returned it for replacement. The replacement is very slightly out of sync of video and audio at the end of movie. Shows poor quality control.
4,I LOVE CHER IN THIS MOVIE,"I DONT CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT CHER, BUT I ENJOY THIS MOVIE SO MUCH I GOT IT IN VHS AND NOW ON DVD.EVEN THOUGH ITS A BIT CRAZY, IT HAS A CLITCH TO IT. LEARNING THAT HER BOYFRIEND HAS TO GO TO PALERMO FOR HIS MOTHER BED-DYING SIDE AND IN THE MEAN TIME LEARNING THAT HE HAS A BROTHER NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT.NICOLAS CAGE COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER PREFORMANCE BUT HE IS GOOD.IN THE MEAN TIME SHE LEARNS HER FATHER IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A LADY THAT ONLY WANTS HIS MONEY AND HIS ATTENTION.IN THE MEAN TIME LEARN THE MEANING TO LIFE AND CHOOSING TO LIVE INSTEAD OF LIVING LIFE WITH OUT NO MEANING."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Moonstruck never feels authentic (e.g. the scenes with the old Italian looking at the moon and saying ""O Bella Luna!"" over and over) but it does feel weird and quirky enough to set itself apart from most romantic comedies; this may not mean it's a good film--I certainly didn't think so--but if you're sick of the usual tripe you can instead watch this unusual tripe."
2,Caricatures,"All the men are stupid jerks who screw up their own lives and the lives of those around them. Fortunately for the safety of New York City, all of the women are wise, patient and nurturing, and manage to get the bozos back on track. No wonder my wife thinks this is the best movie of all time!"
2,Poor use of DVD technology,"This review is not about the movie in general. There are enough of those here already. However the DVD was very dissapointing. Purportedly the sound was upgraded to Dolby 5.1 Surround. The sound instead is washed out and the volume difficult to maintain at one level. Often volume needs to be increased to hear the actors and then reduced again as the background music swells. Almost as bad is the video. It's as if they produced the DVD off an old, beat up print. Small flashes of white and black spots continually appear throughout the movie.I bought the DVD at a reputable retailer, but it plays like a bootleg."
3,I almost returned the DVD unopened - it wasn't letterbox,I almost returned the DVD unopened because it wasn't in letterbox format. Moonstruck is an all time favorite and a great movie deserving of a letterbox format release. I have to subtract 2 stars.
3,Moonstruck,The movie is one of my favorites however it is damaged at 49 minutes. I have repeatedly cleaned it but I can not see any defect on the disk and it continues to have a problem. What do you suggest I do? I am not satisfied with the video as it is
1,To call this widescreen is fraud,"I just bought this widescreen edition and feel totally ripped off!!! I own the standard format edition, and because I love this movie so much, it was worth buying again in the widescreen format. This ""widescreen"" edition is nothing more than the standard format edition with the top and bottom chopped off! This is one time you are actually better off with the standard format edition. I watched both editions side by side, and the widescreen edition was not much wider, and missing the top and bottom of the picture! There was actually more to see in the standard format edition."
4,Thanx,This time it took a bit longer. But I guess it wasn't your fault. Russian Post is to blame. Thanks anyway!
1,it would have been good if cher wasn't in it,her fake italian accent ruined everything! They should have gotten a real talented italian actress to be in this movie instead.
2,Too much talking for me.,An Italian guy with an itchy scalp waits for dessert to ask an Italian woman to marry him. Meanwhile his brother with a wooden hand and a pizza shop and their mother try to stop the wedding. There's a lot of strange cultural dialogue and customs in this movie I did not understand. If you don't enjoy listening to a lot of conversation in kitchens and bedrooms I would avoid this one.
1,"This cd doesn't hold my interest, sorry","I think that it is wise to review this cd seperately, far removed from the movie that featured it.This being said, let's look at the merits of this cd. First off, it featured classical music. The classical music used here was not your regular run of the mill hits that we have come to cherish, but Italian classics. This could be good or it could be bad, it just depends on your taste for C music. In my case this music never struck a postitive nerve. I guess my taste for classical music is to love the big hits of the masters. You know the million seller tunes.I really felt like this music was a waste, as far as my individual needs are concerned. The only song I really got any kind of charge from was the non-classical piece ""Moonglow"". It really stole the show in my opinion!In all fairness, I can not ask anyone to buy this cd."
3,Moonstruck,I love this movie. The only thing that is extremely disappointing is the backround is so loud I can not hear the dialog.
5,Struck by Moonstruck,"I am a Cher fan. Always was and always will be. That said, I haven't always been a fan of her movies. But this one regardless weather Cher is in it or not is a true classic in every way possible. I must have seen this movie 50 times over the last 12 years and still never tire of it. I use many a catch fraise often from the movie that have become part of my everyday language. This story reminds me of my childhood as I came from a typical Italian family and we all acted very much the same way and lived in the Jersey side of NY in a 3 story house with a view of the Hudson. This movie is dead on the character, the vibe and the humor! If you haven't seen Moonstruck, you don't know what you're missing. I might add, this is one of Nick Cages finest performances!Rich"
1,moonstuck,"When this dvd was released, somebody struck out on the idea what a dvd concept was about. The commentary's are helpful and informative. But help me understand why this academy award winning movie is not shown in widescreen? Or not having the input of nicholas cage and his viewpoint of the making of the film? Did I mention widescreen?This film must adamantly be rereleased as a special addition in widescreen with full attention to detail then it will deserve five stars. Until then stick to video and save your money."
5,MOONSTRUCK,This movie is funny and well written. If you like to laugh and love a love story buy this movie.
5,Chao Bella...,"""When you love 'em they drive you crazy because they know they can"" is just one of so many truthful, poignant, memorable lines from this intelligent, warm, grown-up story. This isn't just a movie, it's the tradition of story telling at it's finest. The music, settings, and characters tell such a fine, truthful tale, I swear I can smell the food in the kitchen, dining room, or restaurant - you'll see what I mean when you see the movie!"
1,Warning - This Movie is Pan & Scan,totally unacceptable. I would not buy this movie until they come out with a version with the Original Aspect Ratio.
1,Why not a widescreen format?,"I absolutely agree with all previous reviews: great movie, but it should be in widescreen version on DVD. Otherwise I can watch it on tv. I hope that someday I'll be able to buy the widescreen version."
1,Disapointed,"I can't believe this Great Film Has not been giventhe widescreen treatment it ,and we, deserve.Some extraswould be nice too."
4,Moonstruck-A cheesy classic tale of love,"This movie is great! Nick Cage when he was younger and Cher when she was...well...anyhow...they both look great and the story is clever and well built on the same grounds as La Boheme, a Lover's classic Opera tale. Cameos by a lot of great actors of our time. The roots of the Catholic Italians in New York is intriging...and the whole issue of age and it's timelessness...Definitely one for the collection!"
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"I never grow tired of seeing this movie. I am not sureif it is because I am Italian and can relate to so many of the scenes and actions, or if it is the excellent acting that Cher,Nicolas Cage and the others put forth in their roles.A love story that grabs your attention from the first act and holds you glued to your seat throughout the movie.Tender, sweet and loving, yet tinted with such true to life raw emotions. Outstanding.This is one movie that no one should miss seeing! Excellent!"
4,"Outstanding movie, lackluster dvd edition","Moonstruck is a movie that easily deserves five stars. However, this DVD edition of Moonstruck has been edited to a full-screen format from the original widescreen. As far as I'm concerned, when publishers edit a film in that manner, they in effect are butchering the film-makers' original vision. One grossly butchered scene involves Cher and Aielo (sp?) together in the front seat of a car: the viewer is allowed to see only one actor at any one time, because the full-screen format will only fit one actor onscreen at once. This causes the audience to miss exactly one-half of each actor's wonderful performance. What a shame.To my knowledge there is no widescreen version of this outstanding movie available on DVD. That's just too bad."
3,Sound is mediocre; still a great movie,"I bought this for my wife, for Mother's Day, to replace our videotape version which was not in the widescreen, theater layout. It is of course great to have Moonstruck now on DVD, in the letterbox format, but the sound seems to have been mixed a little low. I'm tempted to say the sound may have been also a touch less clear than our videotape version. So, one has to crank up the volume on the TV, which isn't such a big deal, but the next time you turn on the TV: Blam! It's blaring."
2,"Great movie, bad DVD treatment.","A cute, romantic comedy. Great scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Very good character development, and Cher and Nicolas Cage work very well together. Olympia Dukakis does a great job as an emotionally deep, morally strong mother with a sense of humour. Great music too, though the 5.1 mix was not very dynamic. Sound stays mainly in the center channel, which itself was muddy, making dialogue difficult to follow at times. The video was pan and scan, which ruins it in my book."
2,"Extremely POOR reproduction quality for ""HD"" Movie","It's a very interesting movie and since I was involved with a large, close knit Italian family for several years, there were many parallels to real life based on my experience...not a bad thing at all. Very enjoyable.On the rental: In addition to having to restart the movie 2 times, the supposed amazon's HD version of the movie is such poor quality it looked like an old VHR quality so that was very disappointing to watch a blurry picture. I did register a complaint though I doubt there will be a change to this particular offering based on the response I received.This was my first and last movie rental from Amazon."
5,movie,"I am a Romantic at heart, love a good love story. Been a Cher fan since day one and she was on TV."
1,Are you kidding me?,Why on EARTH has this been released in pan and scan? I've watched my VHS copy countless times and was looking forward to replacing it with a nice widescreen DVD. But this? Fuggitaboudit!
5,A hit with seniors,I recently took a bus load of seniors on a bus trip. The trip was 3 hours long. We usually have a movie to show so the time goes faster. I picked Moonstruck. It was very funny and very light hearted. It was quite a hit. The seniors were mostly Italian and they really enjoyed the movie. Some of them missed it when it came out quite a few years ago. It's the first time they showed appreciation of a movie by clapping. I was very pleased.
2,Brilliant Movie - Poor DVD,"Serves me right for not checking the viewer reviews first! I absolutely love this movie and gave away my VHS version after I ordered the DVD. So, I *still* have 4:3 screen format, not the Widescreen format I was so looking forward to. Focussing on ""content"" only would be misleading for DVD buyers, Amazon, and I'm tempted to return it. Subtract three stars for a really irritating studio decision."
2,Note to Director:,"Note to Norman Jewison: Re-release this wonderful movie in letterbox format, as intended to be shown. TCM shows the widescreen, why can't the public own it?"
2,moonstruck,This is one of the best movies of all time. The only reason I dont have this movie on DVD is because it is only available in full screen. The movie is a 5 star movie but the DVD only receives 2 stars because of the lack of options for widescreen viewing. I am waiting patiently for them to change it to widescreen and until then unfortunately I suggest the same. You miss so much including the director's vision when you watch it in full screen that it is not worth it until you can see this fabulous movie as the way it was originally made.
2,Very dissapointing sound quality,"The sound quality is so bad on this DVD that I am returning it. I was so surprised that MGM would release this DVD with such poor sound. It totally ruins the movie because you can't easily hear what the actors are saying. Also, the music is such an important part of this movie and is totally destoyed by the lousy sound which I would describe as tinny (equalized towards the upper frequencies). I also, have this movie on an old large laserdisk, and the sound is fantastic on that media."
1,Why Is This Not Letterboxed?,"I have rated the ""DVD"" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time."
3,Moonstruck DVD,Good but emotional. Not as much of an romantic comedy as expected. Plus I am not a Nicolas Cage fan. Would rent not buy.
3,Australian DVD is widescreen,"Moonstruck was a HUGE hit when released in 1987, so much so that it earnt Cher an Oscar for her performance. I enjoyed the film back then, but rewatching it last week, I did not think it was that great. Very over-rated by today's standards.Cher portrays an italian woman, who is at a crossroads in her life. In fact all the characters are at a crossroad. The film explores the risks people take and do not take, in the hope of living a happy life. Just as Cher becomes engaged to her boyfriend, she meets her real soulmate.People interested in buying the DVD should perhaps look overseas. The Australian release is in glorious anamorphic widwidescreen version, whereas the USA version is pan and scan full frame (urgh!)."
5,Perfect,"This is perhaps the most romantic movie I have ever seen. But don't let the word romantic turn you away-this movie is hilarious. There is something in this movie for everyone. Cher and Olympia are great and both deserved the Oscar. It's not full of fluff or trash-it's the perfect date movie.also reccomended: Moulin Rouge, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, About a Boy.*"
5,A modern day classic,"""Moonstruck"" is one of my all time favorite films. Frothy, romantic, and poignant, this film is one to watch over and over again. All of the characters are loveable and endearing. I feel like I am part of the Castarini family every time I watch it. The script is absolutely perfect. Every line is quotable. One of my favorites is Rita's wry, ""Cosmo can't OWN the moon!"" Puccini's gorgeous melodies from ""La Boheme"" make the perfect musical backdrop for this contemporary masterpiece. A gem!"
4,WORTH THE PRICE,THIS COLLECTION IS WORTH THE PRICE..THE ONLY COLLECTION AVAILABLE. UNTIL ONE OF HER OLD LABELS IN THE US DECIDE TO GET TOGETHER AND RELEASE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION THIS IS THE ONE. THERE ARE NO SONGS FROM HER DAYS WITH WARNER BROTHERS OR COLUMBIA. BUT DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.
2,way too hard,"Iv'e heard some of Mauro Piccoto's good stuff and I though this would be like it, but it's way too hard for my liking. Though those of you who like hard techno, go for it, just be warned, this certainly isin't trance (with the exception of ""Back To Cali"")."
2,Not Leather Upper as Described,"My son loves the appearance of the shoe, but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description:-leather-Soft, calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper. I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising."
2,not easy to fit,"i got a pair for my daughter. however, when she tried it on, we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight. though it fits her, it was not comfortable. she ended up not wearing it at all."
1,PRETTY GRAPHICS BUT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,BAD. NOT A GOOD BAD . JUST PLAIN BAD.PEOPLE RUN BACKWARDS AND WEAPONS FLOAT IN THE AIR.THERE IS NO THINKING TO DO ON A MISSION AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO PULL A TRIGGER.MISSIONS ARE TOO SHORT. A LOT OF EFFORT PROBABLY WENT INTO THE GAME BUT IT'S STILL JUST PLAIN AND UGLY BAD.
2,Just OK,This book was alright. It wasn't exactly what I had expected. The story seemed a little above my kindergarteners. They didn't quite understand it all. It would probably be great for first or second grades.
5,Lots of Fun to Read,Growing up I heard a lot of folk tales about Paul Bunyan. I was very amused by those stories. This book puts them all together for me. Very enjoyable to read. Lots of fun in these pages.
3,cute,"You know all about Paul Bunyan right? Well think again. Here are 21 tales of the legendary logger that you must read. Did you know he `made"" the Grand Canyon by dragging a spike behind him on his way home one day! Or did you know that his bunkhouses were so big the loggers had to use parachutes to get out of the bed! Oh My! What tall tales await you in this short story collection!What did you like or not like about the book?The illustrations helped you to visualize the stories.Anyone that loves tall tales will enjoy this book."
3,"Lost Universe (The Slayers ""Sister Show"")","Personally I own 2 of the 4 cds for the Lost Universe (3 cds and a ""Best of Lost Universe"" is all the series has to begin with). I bought them, because heck Megumi can sing! If you liked the music from The Slayers, bet you'll like this. She sings ""Extrication"" (Ending theme) and ""~infinity~00"" (Begining Theme--Yes it's spelled like that!) The only thing I have to complain about from Lost Universe is the Image Songs, they're annoying! Rail, Kain and Kali's songs made me want to cry. But other than their terrible voices, It's a great cd. BTW: Lost Universe merchandise is VERY hard to find, most sites i've been to have waiting list for LU cds, because they are (I believe) no longer being made."
5,The Holy Spirit,DR. Graham brings The Holy Spirit alive. It is a easy read in a descriptive and understanding language.The book goes in to detail to explain how the Holy Spirit can be experienced in your life.

1,NOT for introductory food,"The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job."
1,Contains Tuna Oil from tuna from the ocean. NOT ALL THAT COMPLETELY ORGANIC!!!,"Okay were do I start, how about this may not be a wise source of DHA for your child. Watch a movie called Autism: Made In The USA, so you will know why. The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free. It will benefit you and your child in the long run."
2,Yucky Vegetable Smoothie Add-in,"Gerber changed the recipe for the worse, this version isn't new and improved. It's worse I think because of the addition of the tuna oil/DHA. When the weather cools down I'll hide this in soups and stews as a mystery ingredient. Even the dog won't eat it :("
4,Ice Bound: A Doctor's Incredible Battle for Survival,"This is more than the story of this doctor's discovery of breast cancer. The book is a fascinating study of how all the men and women at the South Pole not only survive, but how they form a special society and how being at the Pole changes most of them forever.An easy and fascinating read."
4,Purgatorio,"Good book, good price. Only problems in the time of release, the book is in good presentation and conditions. I recomended."
3,ok,"After using the Snugglers extra dry, I was a little disappointed in these Pampers. They don't seem to hold the moisture as well."
4,"Good product, could be better","Daughter is 11 months old now but we've been using this for a while now.Some individual diapers tend to malfunction (leaks) but overall this is a good product.Typically, a diaper can go 8 hours (will be full and heavy) before it bothers the baby and/or starts leaking."
5,No leaks for a big boy,"I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2"" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past."
4,Good that it comes unpacked in additional packing,"Pampers or swaddlers all equally good. Swaddlers comes with additional box packing, such a waste on environment. I like it better because it comes without additional box packing"
3,Pampers Baby Dry,"Somehow they hold less then same size Pampers Cruisers, other then that - good product."
3,so so diapers,"These diapers are ok. Comparing to swaddlers, these are just ok. The fit is not all that great and my baby gets red spots on her thighs, from the stretchy bands. And forget about the up to 12 hour protection at night cause after 4-6 hours she is all leaked through. I like that they are thin compared to other brands. but I would recomend the swaddlers."
5,I LOVE Pampers Baby Dry,"I am the mother of 4 ranging in ages 1-16 and I have always used Pampers, they are the best. I have tried them all and none of them compare to Baby Dry. I don't have a problem with leaking, they don't tear easily, they have a nice sent, and they are affordable. What else could you ask for?"
2,Need to change the diaper frequently,"It's okay if I haven't use pampers dry max before. Compare to dry max, dry diaper can't absorb much and it makes the diaper heavy. So need to change the diapers frequently if using dry diapers. My 4 month old daughter is having her first diaper rash after she starts using dry diapers (Previously she used dry max). So I won't buy dry diapers anymore."
5,Great diapers!,"I really like these diapers! I had fewer leaks with these than with the Pampers Swaddlers, and while I like the contoured fit of the Huggies Pure and Natural, I loved the super absorbency of these. They hold a LOT! My baby is a heavy wetter, and we almost never have a leak with these. Even though they are not as stretchy, I find that they fit just fine compared to the Huggies, and for the price difference and absorbency, I would choose these."
5,Easy Purchase....Great Savings!,Thanks to Amazon I no longer have to run to the store to get diapers they just show up on my doorstep! And the savings is great!
4,LOVE THEM FOR DAYTIME!,"Pampers will always be my favorite diapers and frankly you get more in the ""Baby Dry"" than the more tailored pampers that have more gel. My baby doesn't break out with ""Baby Dry"" like they do with the more tailored ones. The only thing I don't like is they don't hold enough wetness at night. But when you have a baby that pees a gallon, I guess you'll have this. ;)"
5,Great Buy,"I have tried Huggies, Pampers and Loves, so far Pampers by far were the best, and for this price of only .17 cents per diaper its a Great Deal! I have priced around and didnt find a better deal for this size. Very Happy"
3,"Very okay, inexpensive diapers","I bought these diapers because of their low price. They are okay, and comparable to luvs. I was expecting better absorbancy since they are ""Pampers,"" but I didn't get it. If your child is close to going up in size, I'd say order a size up. They fit fine either way, but it gives you more absorbancy to avoid leaks. I'm satisfied becuase of their price, but they aren't my first choice in diapers."
5,great price and condition,"Just noticed I could buy open box pampers for cheaper, this arrived just the outside was opened, but who cares we any how dont keep the box, the pampers where closed in original package."
3,Skip it--buy the Luvs,"Personally, i found that the Luvs were just as functional (no blow-outs, keeps the butt dry) and same softness at a significantly cheaper price. This product worked well, but not as much a value as the Luvs pack."
1,RASH CITY,Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
5,Pampers are the best disposable diapers,While I prefer the cruisers it's really not a big deal because the baby dry work just as well they're just not as cute.
2,Great up to size 4. Size 5 leaks at night,"I'm a Pampers fan! From Swaddlers to Cruisers to Baby Dry. But when my daughter moved up to size 5, the pamper leaks at night. She is a soaking mess in the morning. And the soaking is the particles in the diaper. The diaper literally falls apart. I bought one case and it's is almost finished thankfully. Back to Cruisers we go!"
3,They're okay,"I really wanted to like these diapers. They are soft and have really nice vibrant colors, a nice change since I use Huggies usually. I also love the slight baby powder smell. It seems people either love that or hate that. I find that the Baby Dry diapers run small. My baby is on the small side, not even 16 lbs. yet and Baby Dry in a 3 fit him perfectly, there is no way they could work for up to 28 lbs. My son had a couple of leaks in these diapers and it was always up the top because they just don't fit snuggly around the waist like Huggies do with their extra elastic around the waist band. I am betting these diapers would do well for baby girls and for chunkier babies (although you might need to order a size larger) but to get a good fit around the waist for my baby I will have to return to my tried and true Huggies in spite of no nice smell, faded pastel colors and a not so soft diaper. Whatever works though..."
4,Pampers,"I used Pampers swaddlers when my baby was first born and LOVED them!!! It's silly, but since he's outgrown swaddlers and I've started buying less expensive diapers, I've missed the powdery clean smell of Pampers in his room, I also figured they would be a lot better than Huggies because of the price, so I was excited to find a good deal on these Pampers. Turns out they're just fine--they are softer than Huggies, but when they get wet they feel like they are full of gel, kinda weird. I don't think they are worth paying more to get, but I didn't have any problems with them. Oh, and my baby is around 20-21 pounds, and when I am done with this pack, I think I'll move to size 4. He's only 10 months (so a little chubby), and the diapers are getting a little small around his waist. Plus, if he sleeps for a long time, he challenges the capacity."
5,excellent diapers,"It doesn't leak, stay dry for a long time, and above all, has a thinner layer that provides flexibility to my daughter's movement. Strongly recommend it."
2,pretty awful,"We started out with Swaddlers, then moved to Baby Dry at size 2. At size 3, we switched to Huggies. No Pampers diapers have elastic on the back waist, which just asks for a poo explosion up the back. We had SEVERAL, and I finally realized my friend's diapers had elastic in the back so she didn't have this problem! She had a generic store brand even! I will never put a Pamper on my kid again because I don't want his clothes stained."
1,Swadlers are MUCH better - these are anything but dry,"My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."
5,Love these! Great for my twins!,"We have 5-month old B/G twins. I love these diapers. They are thin, yet they protect very well. We haven't had diaper rash yet and will hopefully stay that way. But I do rinse them off almost every time they poop. We tried huggies and they just didn't hold up - too bulky and too many leaks. So go with these!"
5,Pampers work!,"I find pampers work better for longer leaner babies, toddlers than for chunky babies. Less leakage. Huggies work better for chunky babies."
2,cheap diapers,I typically use the pampers swaddlers and thought this would be a good cheaper alternative. These diapers tended to give off gel balls more and worst of all did not have a wetness indicator. Although the swaddlers are more expensive they're definitely worth the money.
3,Just OK -- go with Swaddlers though,"I love Pamper's Swaddlers. I've tried Huggies and both Pampers brands, and out of all of them Swaddlers are my favorite. That being said, the Baby Dry diapers are terrible. If you need a quality diaper, shell out the extra dough for Swaddlers."
2,I didn't expect pampers to downgrade their quality so much!,"I had always been a loyal customer for pampers products. My son is now 11 months old and except for the first month, I had always used only pampers diapers and wipes. I have used these products in India and the quality was much better. I came to USA last month and since I had always used pampers, I went for pampers diapers again.To my dismay, the quality is so low but I thought that it would atleast work well. I have noted that it doesn't last for more than 5 hours. I put the diaper on at 830PM in the night and must change it at around 2 AM in the morning. One day night I didn't change his diaper at 2 and I woke up at 3AM when my son woke up crying, I was so shocked to see the diaper gel lying all over the bed. The bed and the comforter was all covered with the gel that came out.I feel that pampers should atleast consider the health of babies and make sure that their products are upto the standards."
5,Very fast delivery and cheap!,It was so fast delivery only for 3 days and with free shipping also without any tax.It's cheap then everywhere.
2,They have changed the design!,"I'm a little peeved I been using Pampers Nany-Dry for 2 Years, unannounced the company that makes Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers has made a major design change to Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (they seem more like Huggies) - much more elastic, narrower straps and much less absorbent material. It's hard to make it thru the night without a diaper change now!"
3,"Product was OK, ship time was NOT!","It took nearly three weeks for these to fianlly ship. I should have canceled, but I didn't realize until they showed that we had too many for that weight period left."
1,Not recommended.,"I was a Pampers lover,but not anymore. I used Pampers diaper more than three years for my first one and again for second one. But, it looks like the company makes thin diaper recently. As another mom says,""if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere."" I absolutely agree with her. Therefore, I cancelled subscription and changed to another brand."
3,"They hold it in, most of the time","They aren't 100%, but they've been the best diaper we've tried so far. Closer to about 85%. Others we've tried include Kirkland and Huggies. I've been told that the size of your child is a little above average in height and weight, so this may have been the case with the other diapers."
4,"work great, great price","Hi, I bought these diapers for my special needs child. She is 8 years old, but very small so the size 5 fits her just right. These work great and the price is affordable, I subscribed and got a good discount and don't have to worry about running to the store for diapers. The only thing I don't really care for is the tapes that you attach it with are a little too narrow and don't stretch for a more custom fit."
2,Wish I bought a smaller pack,"I bought these because I had a really good deal. Unfortunately, the deal was too good to be true. My daughter consistently pees out of the front when she wakes up in the morning. During the day, these diapers are fine because she lets us know when she has peed. I wouldn't put them on at night. They tend to leave little opaque pebbles on her butt. As for the sizing, they tend to run big with tabs made for newborns. I would use these at daycare or in the diaper bag because you can get 5-6 diapers in a small bag. Right now, I would rank generic diapers from HEB (I live in Texas) better than Pampers."
2,THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS!!!,Pampers Baby Dry is a huge misnomer...they are terrible for urine intake! If your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night...YOU WILL WAKE UP WITH A WET BABY AND WET SHEETS/EVERYTHING!Use Pampers Swaddlers...at least until after size 3 as that is the largest size Swaddlers they make for some reason. You can thank me later. BABY DRY = WET BABY~~!!!
5,I love pampers,"No leaks, no blow outs!! I also love them because it's easy to tell if she has wet or not, other brands are so thick it's kinda hard to tell."
1,Stick to swaddlers,"I'm a new mom and was first I introduced to pampers swaddlers at the hospital...nice fit, wetness indicator stripe, no leaks, good absorption. Well I ordered a case of babydry by mistake thinking they were all the same. I was wrong. The baby dry are ill fitting, poorly constructed diapers that don't even need a wetness indicator because you'll see it all around your baby's sheets!!! You have to always make sure to fasten them up high and tight if not they'll leak. Also if your baby has runny stools good luck. Sometimes they'll catch it other times they won't. I also don't like how they have a plastic bag feel to them. Maybe it's just me, but my rating stays a one star."
1,Leaks at the kid's belly,"Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
2,New born diapers,"I ordered these new born pamer diapers in advance so I would be prepared for when my baby came. To my surprise these diapers were a bit larger then the new born pamper ones the hospital sent me home with and they didn't have the stripe indicator that turns blue for when they have a wet diaper which is important when dealing with a new born. I havent used the diapers yet i ordered from Amazon because they r a bit too big for my new born, even though they say new born on the box and they don't have the stripe indicator..... I wouldn't recommend getting these new born diapers."
5,Good price when you subscribe,"Awesome value, better price than Costco SAMs club. We just subscribed using the trial feature and tried it out. Value buy, enjoy."
1,Expensive and not so good,"Until I moved to the us I used only pampers, but I have to say that the us pampers are less good and more expensive then the israeli version.My children wake up in the middle of the night due to wet diaper, with the Israeli version of pampers it never happend"
5,Good for babies who move around,"I love pampers it's durable. I didn't like it when my baby was 2,3 months old because when he poops it leaks in the back. After he started sitting down and walking it is the perfect diaper for him"
5,AWESOME overnight protection,"LOVE these diapers!! My 8 month old daughter was leaking through her diapers until we found these!!! No more wet sheets in the morning!!! AND, you CAN'T beat 222 diapers for 30 bucks!!! LOVE AmazonMom!!!"
5,Great - Be sure to get a larger size!,"We think that these are great diapers. Virtually never have a blowout.What we learned is that the weight recommendation on the box should generally be ignored. The size 5 packaging says 27+ lbs. Our baby started wearing these at around 16-18 lbs.It's really very simple. When the diaper gets full, there's no more room...thus the blowout.With our first child (using the size/weight recommendations), blowouts and ruined clothing were a regular occurance. With our second child (ignoring the size weight recommendations), blowouts are a rarity."
4,Very happy with purchase.,I am so pleased with Amazon Mom especially with buying diapers. The Pampers economy pack gives plenty of diapers to last me until my next delivery. I love the price.
4,pampers,great for the money. Especially if you sign up for subscribe and save and amazon mom discounts. I like it more than many other brands i tried.
3,its ok,I thought they were the swaddlers so i was a little disappointed. But they worked fine. I think you should use cloth because it is more cost effected and better for the environment. My babe was to small to fit in the cloth diapers that we had so we had to use disposables. So I am very happy to start using cloth now that he is gaining weight. But what whatever diaper you choose you are the best mom or dad for you baby. Keep up the good work and and love them lots.
3,"Love the price, never a leak, but they feel wet when ""full""","Two kids and never had a leak with these, aside from the occasional up the back blowout that I don't think any diaper could have controlled...but Pampers seem to feel sort of damp/wet when they get full, which I've never experienced with other brands. Not using these at night for our kids because we think they seem to wake up at night more often in these...perhaps because of this feeling of wetness? Like the price, wish it didn't have the wet feeling."
5,wonderful diapers,"great value, great diaper, my 21 month old daughter leaked in every other brand except PAMPERS, i love pampers brand, however i did have to buy a size 5 in the Pampers and in other brands she could wear a size 4 but i wont buy any other brand now."
1,HORRIBLE!,"These diapers are the worst. I bought them thinking that I wouldn't have any nighttime accidents & my son would wake up dry.Boy was I wrong! Carson wakes up almost every morning with spoiled sheets.I use the Pampers Sensitive during the day, & thought that the Dry Max would make him feel more dry - but he wets his diaper almost every night!They are also not as soft as the Pampers Sensitive - which was a downside to the Dry Max diapers, too.I wish I would have gotten a smaller amount, not a box of 200+. It was such a waste of my money. For a diaper that makes big promises, I am greatly disappointed."
4,Baby dry pampers,They work great only had a few times where it leaks not a lot would buy again because of the price. Bought from amazon fast shipping. Amazon rocks.
5,Questions?,I subscribed to getting diapers once a month. My question is how can I go in and change the size? My daughter is a size three now but will be in a four pretty soon.
3,"Soft and absorbent, but they STINK!","Pampers diapers are good. These Baby Dry diapers are cheaper than the Cruisers line of Pampers, but performance is the same so they are a great value. I deducted two stars because the smell of these diapers literally hurts my nose. The day the box arrived, it sat in our entryway from afternoon until the evening, and we could smell the diaper fragrance all the way from the back of the house. You can imagine how it was once we opened one package. I wish Pampers would stop adding that baby powder smell to mask the chemical smell to their diapers. VOC's? Don't know, but the strong fragrance and chemical smell gives me headaches. My husband thought I was exagerating until I handed him the baby. He asked what offensive lotion I had slathered the baby with, and I told him it was the diaper. He did not believe me and sniffed the baby's bottom and started coughing in disgust (and there was no poop). The fragrance is too strong and offensive."
1,They burst when full,"I bought these as a ""night time"" diaper. Most of the time, they work great. However, if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere (about the consistency of little bits of tapioca). It is very difficult to get all of it off of my daughter without giving her a bath, and I worry about what chemicals it might contain. This has probably happened three times in the last two months (only putting the diapers on at night). I am going to stop using them now. As a note, my daughter weighs about 24 pounds, so we are on the low end of the weight range."
2,Waste of money,Buying Pampers or Huggies is flushing your money down the toilet. Luvs work just as well at a fraction of the cost.
1,hate them!,"Hubby brought home these diapers because we were running really low and he couldn't find the swaddlers that we normally use. I really wanted to give the diapers a chance and used them for a while, even after the first few blow-outs. There was leaking every single time. It just didn't seem to absorb anything at all. We're back to using pampers Swaddlers again and I make sure we NEVER run low!!"
1,"""Dry"" is such an exageration","I only used Swaddlers and Crusers since my baby was born. Recently I wanted to try the BabyDry because they were a little cheaper. This was a BIG mistake. The babydry don't stay dry at all, especially not as long as 12 hours as advertised. It would stay dry for 4 hours maybe. These things leak (not overflow); that is it I sit my baby on my lap, after a while my pants will be wet. Moreover 90% of the time the bed will be wet in the morning, unless the baby cries in the middle of the night and I use that occasion to change her.In the end these babydry diapers are MORE EXPENSIVE than the Cruisers due to the fact that I have to change my baby a lot more often. I will NOT buy these babydry diapers again."
5,Good price gr8 shipping time,"Pampers is the best brand available as compared to others pampers is the best but buying pampers from amazon made my life easy.i dont have to rush to the stores to buy the same box with a higher price,and absolutely loved amazon when i saw the box delivered after 1 day."
3,Diapers,I thought I was buying the Swaddlers when I ordered these diapers. They sometimes leak and are inferior to the Swaddlers. I loved the economy size though and would order that many again.
4,Good ones but No indicator,"Only minus point is this product has no indicator.Product is good better than other ones in market, initially i was worried whether this would leak as i read some reviews, i had never faced leakage till now,there is no leakage in this Baby DRY Pammer product, may be i havent tried for more than 12 hours, absoultely good for a 3-4 month old baby."
1,Baby Dry - Rip Off,"Good deal for the price? NNOOOOO, they are the worst diapers and they rip off (Literally the velcro Rips off every other time) and the diapers are so flimsy and can not hold anywhere near the cruisers. this is the first time I ever bought them thinking they should be ok as my son is old enough to go to some economical diapers. big mistake, from last two days we had 3 leaks and two diapers velcro ripped off while trying to put the diaper. Save your self some trouble and stay away from this diaper. still do ot understand how it got such high ratings, may be people may not have tried the cruisers."
5,Best Diapers!,"This is absolutely the best way to get diapers. Auto ship: 2 boxes per month. In a science fair experiment at our elementary school a 3rd grade student compared Luvs, Huggies, a local store diaper, and Pampers. Pampers won out and this is one item that I stick to!"
5,good product,"Good as diaper lasts long. Good during travel and keeps dry, no body rashes. Good for boys under 8 months."
5,Love the product and the service!,"We couldn't be happier with the Pampers products in general. We've had some nasty ""messes"" on our hands and these keep everything well contained AND are thin for our little man to move around comfortably."
5,"No leaks, best diaper on the market!","I've been using Pampers Baby Dry diapers ever since my daughter was born 2 years ago. These don't ever leak on us, and blow-outs non-existent. They feel soft and seem comfortable. I've heard about babies getting rashes with the Dry Max line, but these seem great for sensitive bottoms."
1,Horrendous Smell!,"The Huggies Supreme diapers are the only diapers my wife and I will ever use! They are quality diapers that never leak for our 2 kids under 2.Plus, they don't have any disgusting scent at all! We have tried Pampers and Luvs, and not only do they leak, but they have the most horrendous scent - we had to throw them away!Trust me - Huggies diapers are worth the small amount of money more you will pay!Highly unrecommended 1 star review."
2,Quality issue,I purchased a box of Pampers baby dry size 1( 252 pcs) and found brown stained at the front of the diapers. Still have 2 unopened bags with brown stained.
3,item is not as expected,"I subscribed this item. The first few package included the original Pampers recharges box. At this time the recharges box was NONFUNCTIONAL, and very different looking from the originals (not even showed the Pampers logo). If it wouldn't be from Amazon, I would say it is counterfeit... If the next time I get the same nonfunctional recharges box then I will unsubscribe this item."
1,Would not buy again,"I have been using Pampers cruisers with both of my kids, and never had any problems. But recently decided to try baby-dry diapers, and now very dissapointed that I even decided to try. For the last few nights my little girl woke up crying, because she was wet from head to toes. Baby-dry diapers are fine for daycares where the child is changed every hour, but they are horrible for the night time. I would never buy them again!"
1,Big Disappointment !,"I have been using Pampers Cruisers for the longest. One night I ran out and I had to run to the store to buy some more. They did not have the Cruisers but instead had these. I purchased them thinking if I had as much success with the Cruisers then these should not be much different from those. W R O N G !! I couldn't wait to get rid of these !! EVERY Morning my son would be soaked through the diaper, sheets all wet, and very smelly ! These hardly hold anything through the night ! The name is not fitting what so ever ! I actually can't believe that Pampers would even put their name on something like this ! The diaper is thin, cheap, and honestly a headache! If you want something that is guaranteed to hold through the night, without any of these problems, go with the Pampers Cruisers ! Because these right here are a total waste of money, manufacturing, and time ! Major Fail !!!"
3,Little dissatisfied,Product seems inferior in quality to the Baby Dry product we bought from a store. There is no wetness indicator either.Not very satisfied.
3,There OK,"Pampers were great when my liitle ones were little, but not so much as they are getting older. They dont hold as much. They are still great diapers but just not for my girls as they have gotten to that age where they pee a LOT"
1,So sad :-(,"We have LOVED Pampers - have used them exclusively for all 3 of our children until now. I just upped my almost two year old from Baby Dry 4's to size 5's, expecting no big change, just help with her volume increase. Something has definitely changed! I first noticed a new chemical-like smell I never smelled with any previous Pampers Baby Dry. Then my daughter quickly developed a diaper rash. This child has never had a diaper rash a day in her life before this. I was still hesitant to believe it really could be the Pampers (they're so great! no leaks! so cheap on Amazon! I've ALWAYS used them!), but finally bought some Seventh Generation diapers to try, and the diaper rash vanished. MAJOR BUMMER!!! Why ruin such a great product, P&G? So sad to cancel my Subscribe & Save sub for these... :-("
2,Very Disappointed,I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.
3,Not as good as Swaddlers,"I accidentally ordered the Baby Dry type instead of Swaddlers, which I had been using up until this point. When I opened them, I seriously thought they were Pampers knock-offs. They are so thin and looked to be poor quality. Why would Pampers put their names on something that looks so cheap? Since they had been opened they couldn't be returned so I sucked it up and began using them. They are stronger than they look, but they are also more prone to leak than the Swaddlers because they are thin and don't fit to the body quite as well. You can also see BMs through the diaper due to the thinness of them. Yuck. So I am finishing up the box and then going back to Swaddlers. Every time I use one of these diapers I am in fear that they will leak all over something. I have no confidence in them. On the upside, you can fit more in a diaper bag, clothes fit over them more easily, and I imagine they produce less waste due to their thinness."
5,great service,it was fast Service and cheap for the amount of diapers I can always pick Amazon for these kind of deliverys ......cool
3,As expected,"Pampers are the best, softer and better looking that the BJ brand which I used to buy just to save couple bucks until now, amazon got those for even better price and better quality, you can't beat this deal."
2,Not too happy,"I prefer the Pampers Swaddler, It was my mistake I got the wrong kind but had already placed my order and didnt realize that they weren't swaddler. Gave my poor baby a rash. These diapers are too thin for my baby. Not pleased at all"
1,Waste of money,I have used pampers for a lot of years but have always used cruisers. I tried the baby dry version and couldn't be more disappointed. Just two diapersin and both were soiled through. Now I don't know what to do with the other 190!
2,"The bigger the diaper, the less it holds...","In the past year, I've come to appreciate and only purchase the Pampers brand for my growing daughter's needs. After reaching 15 months of age, however, the diaper wasn't able to keep hold up to overnight use and I started using a nighttime diaper from a different manufacturer. As grandmothers and others watch the baby, they don't know which diaper to use at which time, so I've completely switched from Pampers to another more sturdy brand that doesn't leak and doesn't cause wet mornings."
5,good,excellent experience with pampers. i always use pampers only to my son since his birth. pampers is a nice product
2,so thin,"I liked pamper baby dry size 4. So I tried size 5 and expected it to last long. However, the size 5 one is so much thinner than size 4."
3,Pampers vs huggies,"So is the first time that I use pampers brand and I think is good during the day but not for the night my baby wwoke up wet every morning, I think next time will stick with huggies."
1,Does not justify its name!!,"I bought pampers baby dry for my new born. An absolute waste of money. Used only a few and i already hate them. Leaks, and becomes a wet cottony ball,and does not fit right will not suggest this to a friend! And will not use then ever!!! I have the entire box just sitting and collecting dust!"
4,okay,"These diapers are okay, they have decreased in quality recently. The sides near the butt and inner thigh wear out (2-3 times a month) and and the absorbing crystals fall out all over. This occurs even if the diaper has only been on my two year old for a few hours."
2,Disappointed,"I have a two year old. We have been ordering this diaper for over a year now from Amazon. This last shipment has been very poor in that the sides rip everytime I try to ""fasten"" them across her legs/hips. I am very disappointed in the pampers product at this point. Over half of the current package opened has ended in this fashion. I am having second thoughts about my next shipment hoping it is not just the diapers Amazon ships for Pampers."
5,Got what I expected,"Received the diapers as expected and had no issues. Ordering online was convenient and price was good too. Pampers Baby Dry feels soft. When wet the diapers feel very gel like, don't like that feeling though."
5,Great deal on pampers,"We prefer Pampers diapers & these (at least at the time) were a great deal. No complaints. Don't think they last 12 hr though, but none do."
2,"Leaked almost all the time, and every time at night!","Not a fan of these diapers. I have a son, and these diapers leaked all the time. I usually use Huggies and they rarely leak! Thought I would try these because I love the Swaddlers for newborns. Looks like I will be switching back to Huggies."
3,Can't get past the smell,"I read the reviews and tried these, but hate them. I have had a few leaks, mostly up by the waist but at least 2 out the legs. This is baby #4, so I am quite confident with my diapering technique. However, all diapers allow a leak now and then.My biggest complaint with these is the smell. THey are baby powder scented and I don't like it. It is so strong, I can smell the stack of CLEAN diapers when I come in the house even though they are in the other room. And also, the smell disguises the smell of newborn baby poop which I don't like. I would rather smell the yucky stuff so I knew to take care of it.Huggies are better, in my opinion. And the Kirkland diapers, the best. I only wish Amazon could deliver them!"
2,Not as good as Huggies,"They are OK diapers. We have always bought Huggies, and after using these diapers, are firmly believe in Huggies. These get full too quickly and then becomes very very hard to deal with. Our duaghter wasn't comfortable in these either, and constantly complained."
1,Pampers Swaddlers are MUCH MUCH BETTER!,"Same story here! I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for a while before buying this after reading through the reviews. What a huge mistake! It never keeps my 4 month old baby dry, I have to keep changing it as soon as he pees. I'll never buy it again!!!"
5,Love these diapers!!!,"I've been trying different brands and so far Pampers baby -Dry are my favorite. They are soft, durable, last through the night without leaking, and overall, just very convenient. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,i loved this item,"i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country , so i had to cancel. My baby never had problem with these diapers.thanks."
2,"LEAK, BLOW OUT, MESS MESS MESS","These leak so bad. Any time my 1 yr old goes number two, I have to change his clothes and mine. His PJs are soaked around the diaper if he sleeps through the night. I am terribly disappointed. I love pampers swaddlers for babies and thought I would try these to save some money, well no money was saved because I feel like I use double the diapers to keep my ""baby dry"""
4,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers,I only bought pampers because I heard they are the best.. however im rethinking that due to all the poop explosions my daughter has in them!
2,Baby Wet,"I don't normally write reviews unless I feel strongly about them, positive or negative. I feel so strongly negative about Pampers Baby Dry that I felt compelled to write this review. These diapers leak all the time. And not just when they're full- they leak even when the diaper is brand new and dry. They leak so astoundingly bad, that it's as if there is no diaper there at all. It surprises me, because I've actually had a great experience with Pampers Cruisers. I thought Baby Dry would be just as good as the Cruisers, but that hasn't been the case. I'd imagine that because every baby's body is built a little different, different diapers will fit better than others, so not everyone will have the same experience with the same diaper. All I can say is that, for my son, Baby Dry is about as bad as they can get. I'd go with Pampers Cruisers instead."
5,Love these diapers,"These diapers have been my go to with both my children. They do not leak overnight, and do not cause any skin irritation like other diapers. If you are looking for a quality diaper, order Baby Dry diapers!"
1,Not something I would buy ever again,"The overall quality of Pampers has gone down so much and babydry is worse of all. after just two hours of putting it on, it breaks and actually all the inside material comes out. I had to vacuum so many times after having such incidents. no more babydry for us."
2,Not as good as swaddlers - leaky,"I love pampers swaddlers, but these are less expensive for a reason. The Baby Dry line has the blue colored inner liner (gel?) which is not as absorbent as swaddlers. The first diaper we tried leaked after just about 1 hour of use. We sent the box back and bought the swaddlers again. Amazon made the return easy, and even set up the UPS pickup at our door, which was a plus."
4,love Pampers,"We love Pampers Baby Dry. We have used it with both of our boys. The economy size you get so many diapers for your money. Plus Amazon Mom gives a great discount. And if you can get any coupon codes, you can score a BIG discount on diapers. WE LOVE AMAZON!!"
2,Was not impressed by this product,I saw that Pampers had a good deal on subscribe and buy so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately it did not work out for us. We had a lot of leaky diapers. We have tried out Huggies and Kirkland brand diapers and are happy with those. My first preference would be Huggies and then Kirkland
3,"No shipping box, so diaper box was smashed","No outer cardboard box, just the diaper box. Result was huge gashes on 4 sides of the box. Only after careful inspection could I determine if the shrink wrap had been ripped. Diapers aren't exactly something you want to get dirt and stuff in... :-/"
2,Pampers Baby Dry All Wet,"I purchased 204 Pampers Baby Dry Diapers. They are different from ones I have bought in the past. The first week we used them, my 10 month old son peed through his diaper two nights (which he had never done previously) in the middle of the night. They are thin and do not stand up to wetness the way other pampers do. Now I have to go out and buy night diapers to get through all these diapers. I will never buy these again."
1,"Oh, how I hate these diapers!!!","When I had my son 8 years ago, I swore by Pampers. They were the only brand I used. I recently tried them for my one year old daughter after using another brand and in just one week I cannot believe the amount of leaks we have had!! She is constantly soaking right through them. They sag in the back with only a small amount of liquid in them. My husband is begging me to go back to our old brand, which I am promptly going to do. I don't know if these diapers work better on boys than on girls or if they have just changed them. I HATE them! Terrible."
1,Will Never Buy Pampers Again,"I have to believe we got a defective lot, but the right hand side adhesive tab tears itself free on about 2 out of 3 diapers that we put on our newborn--after the diaper is on the baby and her clothes are buttoned up. We have resorted to medical tape to hold the diapers together. This is our 3rd child, so we're pretty sure we aren't trying to put them on too tight."
1,A big design defect,"My son has been using Pamper Cruiser and never had problem. So I think Baby-dry may be the same good. So I ordered some online, but am very disappointed with its design. The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"
4,Great diaper but not a size two,"I love the Pampers Baby Dry diapers. My daughter has never had any leaks or diaper rash using them. I bought the economy pack thinking they'd last a while. But at three months old and 11 1/2 pounds, I'm finding that the straps barely fit and that the leg holes are digging into her skin. I'm going to have to give them to my sister-in-law's newborn so they won't go to waste."
5,Cheapest I can find - even compared to the wholesale stores!,"Great product, arrives on time in a perfect box each time. Can't beat the great price!"
1,Poor quality,Quality of these diapers is NOT same as other Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (same size 5) that I have bought before. These diapers come with very small fasteners and so they don't stick well. Diaper comes off easily. This pack is economy in quality too. I can not believe this kind of product is made by Pampers!!! Will NOT buy this 144 pack again.
4,"Good price, no wetness strip","Don't get confused here, this isn't a swaddler style diaper. There is NO, I repeat... NO wetness strip. This diaper came up when we searched for swaddler and its our mistake for not reading closer. The diaper is a bit small in size compared to the swaddler ones and the lack of wetness strip makes it an easy 2nd place choice to the same size Pamper Swaddler."
4,Not too Shabby,"Pamper diapers are pretty good. They do not hold up as well as huggies as far as leaking goes, but for the price on Amazon its worth it!!"
1,Weren't So Great.,"We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers, and these are nothing like the soft, meshy swaddlers. These are crunchy and thin like store-brand diapers. With swaddlers I could easily let my 3 month old go overnight without a diaper change, but these leaked all over the front of me when I picked him up in the morning. Hated them."
5,Great Product,We use Pampers and this product was great for us! It arrived quickly as Amazon promised and was by far the best in affordability. Would recommend to a friend.
5,"""caterpillar"" flex tabs delivered by Amazon 5/07","Just for those worried (like I was) about getting old non-flextab diapers from ordering this product: I ordered a 160-pack, size 4, in May, and they were the newest version, not the old ones with non-flexible tabs."
3,Pampers Baby-Dry Average,"These diapers are average at doing their job. On my baby, they're not the best fit. They're quite wide between the legs, which is a bit awkward even for my 4 month old who likes to stand, but the bulk between the legs makes it a bit difficult. Also, I prefer the elastic give on the tabs of the Pampers Swaddlers diapers; the stretch makes a better fit up around the waist. These Baby-Dry diapers seem to suffer from ""escape leakage"" up and out the back side quite frequently, and the baby gets changed a minimum of 12 times a day."
5,perfect diaper,"ive been purchasing diapers for years.these are perfect they are soft,absorb well even at night.they work better than the new cruisers.i have bought these and cruisers,the old ones worked well.the new ones leak everywhere especially infront.i have never had a poo leak from these diapers.unless your child has diarrhea there shouldnt be any leaks.these are also a better value than the cruisers."
4,good diapers if your child isn't very active,"The box of diapers came just as it was; in the original box. It was supposed to be raining quite a bit where we sent the diapers to. So I was a bit disapointed b/c we intended on using the box to transport the rest back home (1800+mi). Other than that it was ok. The so-called 2 day shipping was actually more like 5 days. Don't understand that one? As for the product, I have compared the pampers baby dry and cruisers to huggies little movers. My husband and I both loved the pampers when our son was not walking and crawling every where. Now that he is, we prefer huggies after having a few blow-out diaper accidents. We like pampers in general, however the contoured shape of the little movers has not let us down with the really messy diaper incidents."
2,Not for sensitive babies,I am a dermatology practitioner and my own kids have sensitive or eczema prone skin- usually use sensitive pampers but out of stock-this diaper made my 12 month old break out within a day of using.
1,New and Improved with Sagging Technology,"It takes a lot for me to dislike a product, but these are terrible! After a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet, when in reality there was hardly anything in it. They don't seem to hold much before leaking, even doubling the diapers for overnight still doesn't prevent leakage. Definitely, not something I will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is."
2,Not what it used to be!,I only used pampers for my son when he was first born because they fit so well and were extremely absorbable! But after I lost my job I started buying the big boxes from Costco that are the kirkland brand diapers (which are basically the Huggies). I purchased these because of the price at the time with free shipping and the price of gas it turned out to cost just as much as those did. Well I will not be using these diapers for him anymore! They do not hold anything in! He goes to bed with a new/fresh diaper every night and by the time he wakes up 8-10 hours later he is completely soaked through! Never once did this happen with the Costco brand diapers...or pull ups! For 2 weeks now he has been soaking through every night and that is without liquids before bed! No more Pampers for me!
1,"strong smells, no longer the old baby dry any more","I have been using baby dry for a year with the subscribe of Amazon. All the past papers from size 3 to 5 are so good that I found the baby dry diaper is the best on market and Amazon did give great price for it.Lately, I got a box of diapers those are very different from what I used to have. The box size is 172 diapers instead of 156, for which I guess it is the new packing, but should be the same product. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The diaper is very different. All the diapers give out so strong smells that gave me headache. The smell is like the bad play mat or some foam you could find in the cheap way. I then ordered a replacement, and the same thing happened. I have to return. And I guess I would not buy diapers on Amazon anymore."
1,Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers!,"My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But, even though they are less expensive, the Baby Dry type are not worth it! I found them cheap looking and feeling (they could have been mistaken for a store brand.) The absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad, my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet (there was not a fit issue, he was the correct weight for the size I bought, and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper, but literally from the seat.) From now on, I will definitely stick with the Pampers Swaddlers type."
2,BIG MESS,"These diapers seem to have gone down hill fast with regards to quality. Over the past two packages (in a span of around 20 diapers) we have had two diapers burst open at night and deposit the inner crystals all over my toddler and his crib. A big mess and who knows the effects of the crystals? Also, my son has NEVER had a diaper rash and now has a severe case. Pampers Baby Dry diapers has been a good value in the past but will never use again."
1,Quality declined,I have bought four boxes of this product in the past year and had been very happy with it till this latest box. We had to throw away a number of the diapers because the elastic is loose and doesn't conform to the baby's thighs at all. The waistband also tears if the baby moves a lot. Very disappointed in the poor quality.
3,These are rough!,"These diapers are rough, not soft like swaddlers or cruisers. Make sure you know this before you buy. May be better as a night time only diaper. They are more similar to Huggies overnights."
1,"""Baby Dry""?!@ These leak all over the place!","I purchased these for my 7-month-old. They are supposed to keep your baby ""dry"" for up to 12 hours (box states). I'd put these on our baby at 9 p.m. By 4 a.m. they'd be full to the point that they had wet his sleeper (so we'd have to change his clothes at 4 a.m. which did not help our sleeping routine.) I would buy something else and not spend the money on Pampers again. I am now using Parent's Choice diapers from Walmart and these work better for us."
2,Don't bother,"I thought Pampers were Pampers. I was so wrong. Pampers Dry Baby diapers are very thin and when soiled are completely saturated with waste. I change my baby about every 20-30 minutes when he's up and these diapers are awful. Overnight they are not even close to adequate, they stink & leak up his back. Just don't bother and get Swaddlers instead. 2 stars because I got them for 16 cents each with Amazon Mom. I now have 253 diapers to get rid of because I wanted to save some $."
5,Best diapers!,"Best diapers ever! Believe me, with my two kids I tried a lot! Good leakage protection, thin (what is very good for summer)."
1,A raw deal,"I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
3,Absorbs but Rashes Sometimes,"It works for over night well, but I don't know if some of the QC missed or just random rashes occur but we change our baby as soon as she wakes up. It's also missing in stars because I recently found out about the terrible chemicals in these regular diapers. For what it's advertising for (and not claiming to be natural or safe, I guess), it's fine and does the job."
5,Very Good,"Pampers diapers are the best diapers. I would not recommend any other brand of diapers. No matter what stage and/or size your child is, this brand works the best."
1,Horrible Diapers,"I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also, they do not absorb at all...not worth the savings!"
2,Good value but not great absorbtion,"My daughter lives down the street from us with her husband and we keep Tricia, our grand-daughter, quite often. Joe and I love Amazon - he buys almost every tool he uses here! So on his last order he ordered these Pampers baby Dry Economy Pack. the price was fantastic but leaks are too frequent from the sides between her legs. We won't be getting these again and I'm not even sure I want to risk finishing the supply we still have..."
4,great diapers,these are the nighttime go-to diapers. very seldom is there a leak. they fit well and do the job very well.
1,one mess after another,"I have been pleased with the regular pampers size 1, but I'm very disappointed with the Baby Dry Size 1. They are significantly smaller than the regular size 1 diapers and do not cover the back of my baby, so it's been one mess and clothing change after another."
4,The Cadillac of Diapers...,"As a mom of 4, I have lots of experience with diapers! I tried to go the ""cheap"" route early on, but quickly discovered that it does not actually save you money to use cheap diapers. Basically, you end up changing them more often and are more likely to experience what I like to call ""blow outs."" Even when compared to the other name brands, Pampers out performs them every time. They abosorb more and end up saving you money and having to do more washing in the long run. I really love that pampers introduced t he baby dry which are less expensive but just as good as the cruisers from my extensive experience!"
5,GREAT DIAPERS.,I love them on my 14month baby she was using these before bit then started using pamper crusiers but they were a tad bit more expensive when these do the exact same thing. there great hold alot. PAMPERS ARE BETTER THAN HUGGIES.I TRIED THEM AND HAD A HORRIBLE EXPIERNCE. MY BABY WOULDNT HAVE THEM ON EVEN ON 20 MIN WHEN SHE WOULD BE LEAKING. THESE DIAPERS LAST HER GREAT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT REAL FULL (: BUT NO LEAKING. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THEM
1,poor quality,"This is the worst diaper I have used out of all the different brand of pampers. Just because it is more in quantity doesn't mean it is a good quality. I am not ready to more on yet, so I am giving the pampers cruiser a try before I make a final decision to move to another brand of diapers. I am hoping we can still continue to do business, since I have being using this brand for 8 years for all my children."
2,Good but not great,"When my baby sleeps 12 hours, her diaper is wet. It also leaked a few times. Also, on the subscribe and save with Amazon, the price almost doubled within the past 2 months. I got the box for less than $20 in April and now it it over $35. I will check somewhere else for better deals."
2,Pampers dry max cause our baby to have a rash,"Pampers are good quality, pretty good protection against blowouts, etc. But we have two complaints. First of all, there's a mesh on the inside that sticks to baby's bottom pretty consistently. Worse, for us, the ""dry"" part is because of chemicals in the diaper, which caused our baby to develop red, rashy skin very quickly. We've since read that this is a common issue with Pampers, especially ""dry max"". Overall, I would not recommend these to a friend. Huggies and others have worked far better for us."
2,Dry but not the best choice for size 1,Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents. I will probably buy it when the baby older than 6 months because it's cheaper than others.
4,Good diaper,"I love Pampers diapers. I had been using Swaddlers and switched to Baby Dry because it was a lower price. I would say they are pretty comparable. I like the design on the Swaddlers better, the baby dry has blue and is not quite as soft but if you like swaddlers but want to pay a little less I think you'll be happy with the baby dry."
2,"LEAKS, Cruisers are much better","My daughter has been using Pampers diapers since she was born. We tried Huggies size 4, but they felt cheap and thin. Oh and it leaked everytime. So we went back to Pampers Cruisers. She is at size 5 now and I was wondering why Baby Dry was cheaper, so I decided to try a box. Baby Dry didn't do it's diaper job. She has wet her car seat, chair so many times already having baby dry diapers on. We decided to go back to Cruisers. They were the best for my daughter. Pampers overnight for night time use were the best for her as well. Ofcourse there were occasional leaks, but it is minimum. Sometimes leaks happen, but at the minimum is okay."
2,Wet on outside,These diapers feel wet to the touch. I thought it was just me being crazy but then this morning I went to change my son after feeding him and the burp clothe I laid under him (so that if he has a blowout while im feeding him my work clothes wont get messed) was wet. I thought he just leaked but when I looked at his PJs they were wet in spots that were no where near the openings. I diaper had in essences split in different spots! I won't be buying these again.
2,Quality issues,"I usually get Pampers BAby dry from Amazon for my son. And I always have been happy with this product, but not at this time. Surprisingly When I started to use product from this box for night time. It was leaking. At first I could not understand how this happen, because I always used this product before and never had any incident like that. Even though I was changing my son extra time during night and diaper was not really full, he would ended up in the wet bed. I realized it leaks when he sleeps on the side, but it not suppose to happen. I guess I just got defective box. I bought pampers cruisers for overnight use, and used baby dry only for day time. It is sad, but at this time the quality of product was not what I expected."
2,NARJIS,I used them just for a few days . i bought a big box and put them on craigslist for baby dry lovers. but i will not recommend any one to usethem. Every time i had to change layers of clothing with diaper. bad on laundry budget.
5,PAMPERS,I only bought pampers because I heard they are the best.. however im rethinking that due to all the poop explosions my daughter has in them
1,SLOW SHIPPING- WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO DRIVE TO GET THESE,"I PURCHASED THESE 5 DAYS AGO AND HAD FREE ""2-DAY SHIPPING"" AND HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE TWO BABIES AT HOME THAT ARE BOTH IN DIAPERS SO I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE CONVENIENT AND I PURCHASED THESE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO A CITY SO I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US A TRIP... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! VERY DISATISFIED WITH AMAZON!!"
4,good value w/ great quality,"I used to buy Pampers' ""cruisers"" all the time. But after reading some of the reviews here, I decided to give ""baby dry"" a try. (I'm a forever fan of Pampers, so no need to go to any other brands here.)""baby dry"" has proven to be very economical. With 176 diapers in the package , they last a lot longer than the ""cruisers"" without having to compromise the quality. Price wise it's cheaper too. This is my 2nd order and if nothing goes wrong, I'm gonna continue ordering them. However it does seem to be not as soft as the ""cruisers"" but it's keeping dry and I don't consider that a critical factor at all. My baby is happy, no diaper rash and stays dry. What more could have one asked for?Mother of an 18-mo daughter"
4,"Good, expensive","Good diapers. High price, would use store brand instead. Small babies don't pee that much, so save money and buy cheaper diapers."
2,Not good as Pampers Swaddlers,"By the time when I wanted the size 3 diapers for my baby, Pampers swaddlers were not available and I had to buy these after reading the reviews . The problem with these are they don't have the wet indicator and the baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on.It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!This is almost the one of the existing reviews."
1,Looks like old product!!,"I useally buying dipers from amazon.com. However, the dipers on this box are looks like old. Also, I can see the brown spots on the surface. I really want to return it, but I already opened and used some. Check your diper all the time!!"
3,Big price hike ?,"Looks like the price jumped up by around $5 for the 172 size 5...Seems pretty big...Otherwise we have been using this brand since or kid was born, and always ordered on Amazon..."
5,Good quality diapers,This is a good quality product. The leakage is almost none. We have been using it for quite some time now and are very satisfied.
5,Pampers Baby Dry work for us!,"Pampers Baby Dry are the best diapers around for daytime use in my opinion. We tried many other kinds before and these were the only ones that would hold in all of my daughter's pee. Wish they were cheaper, but otherwise they're great!"
3,Too thick,"I don't know if the diaper generated a yest infection in my baby.also, they are so thick that in order to know if it has been pooped you have to open it because you won't be able to smell it."
1,They changed the smell: yuck!,"Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!"
2,no,We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
3,Good,I bought the Pampers Baby dry count 246 but it is not up to the expectations.Better to by Pamper Swaddles
4,Great Diapers,"Can't complain here, these are great for what stinks! Great Value, in fact I think we are still on the first box...our child is now 18. lol okay, that is a joke."
5,Deal on diapers,Recieved diapers in a good time frame. Recieved deal with diapers on sale and no shipping.
2,"Smell terrible, leaky and expensive","The only reason I gave these diapers 2 stars is because they prevent diaper rash if you aren't able to change a wet diaper right away. Otherwise they're awful. The baby powder smell is overpowering and stinks up the baby as well as the baby's clothes. They're also leaky at night because of the lack of padding in the back, so if the baby lays on his or her back while sleeping, protection is unreliable. They don't work for 12 hours at night like the package says. I've used Pampers in 2 other countries--Japan and the Philippines--and the American ones are cheap looking and stinky like the ones sold in the Philippines but cost more than the Japanese ones. The Japanese ones are unscented, don't leak at night, and are cheaper than the American ones sold in stores. The only good thing about buying them at Amazon is that you can get a better price on them, but in my opinion they're not worth buying no matter how cheap."
3,Bulky,"I was excited to try these since I'd read that they are thinner than other diapers. Unfortunately, these are quite bulky in the bottom. I think I will continue my pursuit of a better diaper."
4,Nervous to buy: happy i did,"I normally bought pampers swaddlers for my son (just turned 3 months) but found these for a price i just couldnt pass up--it also offered me more diapers than what i would have bought with the swaddlers. After reading all the negative reviews I was really nervous that I had ordered the baby dry without trying them first, so i quick ran out to walmart and bought the smallest pack i could to make sure that they worked for him before i opened the pkg i recieved in the mail. luckily these diapers have been nothing but successful for me and my son (who has really full wet diapers and some big blow outs). I have not had a diaper leak or fail on me yet! Definatly reccomend them, as the price is lower and you get more diapers! If you're hesitant after reading the reviews go and buy a small amount from your local store to try before buying--but i promise its worth it!!!"
3,Good diaper but it's scented!,The diaper does what it's supposed to do but I was disappointed by the overwhelming fragrance. It's really strong. And mixed with diaper contents make the diaper even more unpleasant smelling.
2,Gave my baby a rash,"We have always used Pampers Swaddlers and loved them, but they only go up to size 3. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, we needed to move her to size 4. I ordered an economy pack of Pampers Baby Dry diapers and she has a terrible rash. I don't think she has particularly sensitive skin, either. We've tried Pampers Cruisers before and will definitely be moving back to those. Although, I don't like this particular product of Pampers, it's the only brand that doesn't leak for us!"
2,Buy CRUISERS instead; these leak too easily.,"I bought a pack of the Baby Dry diapers for what I thought would be for night-time use and use our Cruiser subscription for day use. We have a 20-mos boy and we do not like the Baby Dry at all; my son has woken up a few times with urine soaked shirts and shorts so aside from being unhygenic, these diapers just lack the quality or thickness that the Cruisers are so we'll be cancelling our subscription for them. LOVE CRUISERS for day and overnight use though."
1,Quality dropped in the last 6 months,"I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency, the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option. The strip is not as wide to catch urine, it's been cut down. Constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet, the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything. We've had to change out the sheets, clothes and anything else everyday. Several times, the diapers have ripped apart so bad, they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out. I've grown more concerned, that since it's coming out so bad, it's coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it. Is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost 3 times more expensive overnights? I don't know, but they certainly aren't what they have been for the last 8 years."
3,A little disappointed,"I was little miffed by these. While I love Pampers, I am saddened that these particular ones don't have the DryMax. After using Pampers w/DryMax for the first two months, I loved it! No leakage and less bulk. These did their job, however, we had more than one leak and they add to his bulk."
5,Great Diaper,"Diaper works great - my son is dry till morning. Thin diapers. Only bad is on two occasions, we have had the tape break on us ."
2,Rash after using,"We usually use the huggies pure and natural, huggies snug and dry, and pampers swaddlers (both older type and the newer dry max). We used another baby's diapers which were these pampers baby dry, and my son got huge rash splotches in several areas. I had heard about parents complaining about rashes and thought it was only a concern for babies with sensitive skin, but in 10 months this was the first time my son got a rash from the diaper. Glad we don't have a box of these around to throw out! I can't comment on how effective the diapers are on wetness and containment since we don't use them regularly."
2,Pampers vs. Huggies,"And the winner is......... Huggies.Pampers overnights makes a promise it cannot keep - '12 hours of overnight protection'.Not long after I began using pampers overnight I noticed my son was waking up wet. The kicker - when he wetted himself and his dad after a mere 5.5 hours with no diaper change on a long road trip. (Oops). I even tried plastic underwear - but even that could not help. .I finally figured out if my LO had more than one bottle the diaper merely could not handle the output. Yikes. I thought I would take a chance and try huggies. It's been a week and so far no complaints. He has even woken up dry after having a second bottle in the middle of the night with no diaper change. (tsk tsk but as any mother can tell you, do not mess with a sleeping baby or you will live to regret it). I will keep you posted on any changes!"
4,"it is soft, but not very dry though.","I like it, it's soft. My baby like it, too. But it is not really dry.my babies' butt are wet and reddish sometimes."
5,great diaper,"pampers is the best! We tried other brand (maybe the no. 2 brand), but we came back to pampers and would not try any others."
3,good product...even the elastic waist band.,"I am disappointed with the change they made to this product. Like some moms said, it was a really good product for the price they offered. it had all the benefits, even the elastic waist band."
4,"Soft on my baby, but not sturdy enough","My one year old was on Huggies and I wanted to try Pampers to see if it was better. Although it was very soft on baby's skin, it wasn't sturdy enough for baby's movements. I also felt that I should've bought a size bigger. Now I am back to Huggies."
3,Not as good as Swaddlers,"I was using the Pampers Sensitive Diapers for my Newborn and they were working great. I then used Swaddlers and I love how they are soft and yet keep my baby dry. I used swaddlers with my other two kids. I used this new ones and I don't really like them. They are very thin and feel like paper. I love how soft the swaddlers feel like cotton. For my two month old, I prefer the swaddlers hands down."
2,It leaks,We used Swaddlers size 1 and thought would changed to this for size 2 to see what's the difference. We found that this one leaks! It also has a little chemical smell and the size isn't as big as Swaddlers size 2. Pamper Swaddlers is much better in our opinion.
2,Pampers Baby Dry diapers don't hold nearly as much urine as Huggies,"Our daughter is 22 months and we just got a box of Size 5 baby Dry diapers. We can't use these at nighttime and we have to check her diaper frequently. If she drinks a lot of water, the urine leaks right out of the diaper.My wife had me order another box of Huggies Snug & Dry Size 5 immediately. We'll try to use these ones up, but when we run errands or go to church, we will use the Huggies.I do not recommend these diapers at all. It's not worth the $0.03 difference per diaper from Huggies. I gave it a fair chance and learned my lesson."
1,Leaked after 4 hours,"We accidentally bought pampers dry instead of cruisers diapers, so we decided to try them. I immediately noticed the odor of urine. When out with gramma, they leaked after 4 hours of wear. We normally use cruisers and they have provided us consistent coverage and have never failed. Cruisers seem to cover more surface area and last for 12 hours through the night. I also do not notice the urine smell as soon as the diaper becomes wet with cruisers. We will be using cruisers from now on."
5,I love this brand!,I love using baby dry on my five month old.. they never leak and my baby sleep from 8pm and I dont change his paper until 5:30 am. I love that they fit just fine not to big not to small. I love these pampers so much that I usually buy a convenience pack instead of buying them separately on the store. I recommend this brand to any mommas out there. Plus they have gifts to grow~ you enter a code and you earn points and then you could buy stuff for free.
2,Diapers tear easily,I have bought baby dry diapers before and have been satisfied with it. But this time I ordered it from Amazon. The diapers tear when they are opened from prefolded packing. Sometimes I have even found that the gel or the stuff its made from has leaked. I am extremely dissapointed with this lot of diapers. Now on I'd rather buy it from a store than order oline so its easier to return.
4,Great Day time Diapers,"My only issue is that they dont last all night and for my kid who drinks milk during the night, I have to change diapers several times during the night ... However, I am not sure if there is any better product out there for my situation!"
2,Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry,"When my son wheres Pampers, the poop always rides up his back. I am very disappointed in these diapers and can't believe all the positive reviews. I gave it 2 stars because it does hold in pee alright for 3-4 hours max. These diapers don't perform as well as Huggies Snug & Dry."
4,Dry Baby,"This diaper seems to keep our baby drier than other brands and they aren't very bulky.The only problem was at night, and I doubt it has anything to do with the diaper. She tends to leak out the top of the diaper at night. So, we put 2 on her at night, one facing forward and one facing backward. Works, so far."
5,Great diapers,"I don't know why people complain about these diapers vs the Pampers cruisers. the only time I have leaks with my 8 month old is when she has an excessively large BM....not that often, and Cruisers wouldn't do much better. When she was littler, I wasted my money buying the swaddlers line for my daughter. The truth is, she doesn't know that difference, and would rather have me put the savings toward her college education."
1,Do not buy,"These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again."
3,Absorbs Less Than Cruisers,"It's not a bad diaper, but it does absorb a lot less than the Cruisers. My son drinks a lot of fluid, and therefore also pees quite a bit. The Baby Dry needs to be changed out more often to avoid leaks than the Cruisers, but it is a bit cheaper. However, I really don't think the tiny little price savings is worth it considering the extra effort and the extra cost of using more diapers."
1,New design- Bad change,"I have used the baby dry diapers for months now. The last two boxes I have recieved do not have as much of the blue absorbant material and the diapers are overall totally different (almost flat). Although the diapers worked well for awhile, the new design leaves much to be desired."
1,Leaking all the time,"I have a boy and this diapers are really bad for him and for me :-/.They are leaking all the time, even if it is a new not over wet diaper.Buy something else if you don't want to wash the clothes many times a day !!!"
3,The diapers are good but the packaging was bad,"The Pamper's Baby Dry diapers are much better than Luvs. The Luvs Diapers leak a lot and does not have very good absorbing power.However, regarding the Amazon packaging, I was not happy. There was no separate packaging from amazon. The diapers came in Manufacturer's original box. Even the manufacturer's box was wide open when it came through UPS exposing the diapers inside. This is really not expected from amazon."
1,Too Small even when compared with other level 1 diapers,"I wanted to try this product for my baby girl. To my surprise, it was too small for her when compared with other brand level 1 diapers. I had to reorder my diapers again."
3,Just Ok - not like Swaddlers,Swaddlers are way better than baby dry. I won't be ordering these again. They just don't absorb # 2's like Swaddlers and there isn't a netting like Swaddlers that keeps the baby's skin dry.
1,Diaper leaked after 7 hours on the first night,"I bought these because my 6 month old started leaking with her Pamper Swaddlers. These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing. Pick up a small package before you buy the value size to see if they work for you. These diapers did not work for my daughter."
5,diapers and wipes,Had no issues whatsoever and the products came as scheduled in great condition. Much better than driving to the store for diapers and wipes and here I am saving money. I wish I knew about this sooner!
5,Satisfied,Love pampers and this is a great way to buy them. Price is great and I don't have to walk down the diaper isle every week!
2,Not an overnight diaper,"I have used pampers cruisers consistently and mistakenly bought these baby dry ones this time around. It was a mistake. My 21-month old (21 pounds) sleeps 12 hours a night and with these diapers in size 4 (up to 37 pounds) she wakes up with pee having soaked through the diaper onto her pajamas. She ever peed through the diaper on a 2 and a half hour flight. Not sure why they are called baby dry, but they sure don't keep her dry at all. I just placed another order for the cruisers, but now I'm stuck with 150 of these poor diapers too."
4,Very reliable and comfortable,Bought these for my newborn baby.Would definitely recommend them.Most importantly our newborn had no rashes which is common with low quality diapers.
5,great price and great product,Great price. better than any other shops around here. Great product too.All my family and friends love this product as well.
3,So So diapers,I had a lot of leaks and messes to clean up with these. Pampers Swaddlers work so much better. Not sure what we will do once they are in a size 4.
1,The Worst!,"I am a longtime Amazon buyer and a first time reviewer. I am also a Pampers Swaddlers devotee and so I thought, a fan of Pampers in general. I have since found that all Pampers are not created equal. I typically use Pampers Swaddlers in the day and Huggies Overnights at night for my 8 month old son - who is not by any means a ""super soaker"". I bought the Pampers Baby Dry because they had a good deal going, so I thought I would give them a try. With ""12 hours of overnight protection"", what's not to like? The first night I used these, I found my son's entire frontside wet in the morning. Okay, so it's hard to find a really good overnight disposable. Maybe I should have bought one size up from his usual. I thought, ""I'll just use them during the day..."". Well, after just 1 nap and about 3 hours in the diaper, again soaked. What a waste!"
5,Awesome overnight diapers!,"To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those."
3,"Missing the ""Wet Line""","I am a new mommy, but I have learned really fast what diapers work and which ones don't. I love Pampers! The Baby Dry have been great, except that they are lacking the stripe that turns blue when baby is wet. The line is super helpful; it made us realize (after using non-line diapers) that our son was wet ALL THE TIME, which was causing a lot of his fussiness. Otherwise, they are great! No leaks!"
5,Great diaper at a great price with Amazon subscribe and mom club,Not much to say. They do what they are supposed to. Earlier we tried the discount diapers and they didn't fare too well. Dealing with a few blowouts and peeing through some diapers at night we came back to pampers. You really can tell the quality after using discount brands. I am sure others have the same feeling for other brands but Pampers works well for us. Awesome delivery and price with Amazon Mom and subscribe and save.
5,great,These diapers are great for my 2 year old. We haven't had any leaking issues and they are much softer than the huggies she used to have.
1,They always leak.,We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.
2,"Soft, cute designs, but leaks","The Pampers Baby Dry diapers seem to be leaking often even after a new diaper has been put on. I changed my son's diaper and it leaked within 15 minutes on 2 occasions. They seem to fit him well and are soft and cute, but somehow aren't effective. I'm sure that it's like many products. They work extremly well for some, but for others, the product does not work."
3,Not as good as Dry Max !,"Accidently ordered this one instead of ""Dry Max"" ... the diapers are thinner, lighter and didn't hold as much as ""Dry Max"", but it's usable. Because it didn't cost much cheaper than ""Dry Max"" ... so this was the only non-Dry Max Pampers that I ordered since."
2,bad,"Used pampers cruisers,just loved them, for over 2 yrs.....then they just stopped making those and started baby dry. I hate these. Leak all the time. I dont understand pampers,why fix whats not broken??Now have ordered huggies,hope they are better.neeta.doc.nita@gmail.com"
2,baby dry sucks,Babies cannot wear these!! the poop just pours out of them. They do not absord and this is because they are for older babies with solid foods.... Stink with swaddlers or cruisers!! will never buy this type ever again.
4,Love these diapers,"I have been using these for a little over 4 yrs...before that, I admit I was a Huggies mom for 9 yrs. But after using Pampers ..Huggies felt like hard paper and did not smell fresh. Overall I like Pampers because they look cute, smell fresh and work well. The only time I've had leaks is when they need to move up a size, and occasionally poo up the back (I'd love to see a tighter elastic fit across the back)"
4,Good deal,"Looking everywhere, these are the best deals, price/diaper. No real issues with leaks (no more than other brands). I have had a few when I go to pull the Velcro, it breaks off. It's happened to about 3-4 diapers. Called customer service and they were great"
5,Diapers,"Cheaper than purchasing in the store. Comes to my house, and it is always a better price. What's not to love?"
1,Avoid these diapers unless your baby does not move,"Terrible diapers. We normally buy the cruisers and I accidentally purchased the baby dry diapers. The diapers continually leak! Even when they have been worn for short periods of time, they really can only hold a small amount of urine if your child is at all mobile."
5,pampers,I love just being able to buy diapers for the month from Amazon and it saves me a lot of money and trips to the store.
4,best for the $$$,"these do a very, very good job. huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get. actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less. with the amount in the box - one case is good for almost a month. rarely leak - even w/ a 2 year old at night."
5,Best there is..better than the new Cruisers,Pampers Baby Dry have been our choice for our 2 year old since he outgrew the Swaddlers. We liked the old Cruisers too and we used to switch back and forth between cruisers and baby dry. But I'm not very fond of the new Dry Max Crusiers. So we have started using Pampers Baby Dry exclusively and have been very happy.
4,Pampers Baby Dry size 4,"These diapers work very well. My son actually could still fit in size three but I've moved him up and even though they are a little bit big, we never get leaks at all."
4,fits our baby the best,"as every new parent out there we were completely confused with the whole diaper situation: what brand is better, what are the differences, what size fits, is chlorine-free option important, etc. we've tried/tested almost every brand available on the east coast, including some store brands. Pampers came out on top, hands down.- the absorbency is great. other brands remain wet inside causing diaper rash.- the elastics are snug, but not tight. we didn't have any accidents with leaking. not counting one, when we overtightened the diaper by accident.- the cut and nice and generous. fits chubby legs well.- the material is soft. doesn't feel like you are putting sanding paper on your baby.one complain: very strong powdery smell. but we got used to it."
5,love it,"I love this diapers. They can hold pretty good. And no rash ever. My baby is turning 6 months, only the first box of diapers I did not buy from Amazon. Good deal,A+"
4,Great for 12 Hour Protection,"We only use these for nighttime so I cannot vouch for them other than that. But our boy sleeps 11-12 hours in them and they DO NOT leak. If they start to fit too small or cut it a little close we just get the next larger size--so they are always a little big on him. They are not as soft as the swaddlers or sensitive, but for a nighttime diaper they hold a lot and also do not give him any type of diaper rash. Baby Dry also does not have dry max."
4,Pampers Reliable As Ever,I used Pampers for my 1st child and doing so again with my 2nd. They fit great on kids who are wider through the hips and behind.
4,Pampers come through again!,"We used to use Pampers Cruisers but have tried Pampers Baby dry diapers and they are great! Absorbant, fastener tabs stay closed, and do not leak! Keep my baby dry and no yucky gel or smell! Thanks pampers :)"
4,Great fit for my son,Thia baby dry diapers are perfect for a newborn. Great fit and easy to put o and take it of. A lot better price than going to any retail store. Great products def.
1,Not a dry baby,It says they are 12 hour diapers but not so much. We use them as day only diapers and change frequently. I like the dry max much better.
3,this was sent as a new baby gift,"I sent these diapers as a ""new baby"" gift so I have no direct experience with using them. The new parents like the diapers and the fast delivery(at no cost to me!)from Amazon.com. That is the best that I can do . . ."
1,Getting worse and worse....,"I use Pampers for my kids for more than 3 years.. I always liked them, until few months ago.. I thought maybe a packages wasn't good, and then I see it again and again...1 out of 10 diapers is falling apart... ""wings"" are come off, when you try to put diaper on!!!I don't want to buy Pampers again.... :("
1,Stinky smell in a clean diaper? No thanks!,"Previously we had used Earth's Best since size 1, 2.5 years ago. I recently decided to save money on his size 5s and go non-ecological with the mainstream ""best"" which are apparently Pampers. Not only do they smell like pungent baby powder out of the package, they just don't work. Our son isn't overly wet, due to regular diaper changes, but these diapers couldn't even contain pee for a 2 hour span. In addition, when he wakes up his pajamas smell like he had an accident, due to the thinness of the Pampers. And yes, more often than not he was wet through to the pajamas, sheets, etc., and if he pooped overnight, he was rewarded with a sopping wet diaper, a wedgie, and poop leaking out. We have four kids, and trust me, use Earth's Best. Does anybody want 152 Pampers?Hope one of these links works, and of course, look for subscribe and save!!Amazon search--Earth's Best TenderCare Chlorine Free Diapers, Size 5 (27+ Pounds), 104 CountDirect cut and paste-- [...]"
1,Pampers Baby Wet,These diapers absorb MUCH less than Swaddlers. They don't have a prayer of lasting through the night despite the claim they last twelve hours. Really disappointing product.
1,Horrible thin diaper leaving my 14 month SOAKED THROUGH,We have been purchasing Pampers Baby Dry through Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save. This last shipment of diapers were horrible. Pampers has lost our business. The diapers were paper thin and my 14 month old boy kept waking up soaked through. Leaving the bed soaking wet. Something is horribly wrong with these diapers. We will be changing to another brand ASAP.
2,Incomplete Shipment,The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
1,TERRIBLE! Leaks!,This is the worst nighttime diaper we have used. They leak 100% of the time leaving our baby drenched in her own urine! Awful. :( I highly recommend Huggies Overnites-zero problem with leaks and a great fit.We will not attempt to use these again.
3,Quality is great but LEAKAGE..,"We have tried different diapers, we really liked the built of Pamper, the quality of the materials is best (light weight and very soft) however it leaks badly so we had to change whole cloths of our baby time by time which is frustrating!! We pay more for Pamper diapers to get some good things however for some reason it doesn't worked for us.. Still we are using Pamper as it's very good materials. :("
5,The best!,I have tried multiple diapers and these work the best. They have the best fit and are great for overnight sleepers.
1,Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY,"We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the ""swaddlers"" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers."
4,arrived and satisfied,arrived and satisfied..box kind of beaten up but will see when I open it if any diapers are damaged .If no damage all is well !
5,a good choice,It's a good choice. Help me to save some money.It's good enough to keep dry for about 5 hours or up and it's much cheaper than the rest of pampers.
4,"Better than Luvs, not as good as Swaddlers","I made the mistake of having my daughter wear Luvs during a fancy party in her honor. Well, they leaked HORRIBLY and ruined her party outfit. I've never had this kind of problem with Pampers, although we do get the occasional leak, especially at the waistband. I've found that a better choice than Pampers Baby-Dry is Pampers Swaddlers, with elastic all the way around the waist in addition to around the legs. Still, if leaks at the waist aren't much of an issue for your little one, the Baby-Dry Pampers will do fine."
3,not the FLEX as advertised,"i really liked the new FLEX version of the baby dry diapers. this is advertised as the FLEX but wasn't when i recieved it. dissappointing, b/c it's harder to use on my kids without that stretch tab."
1,Leaky... Leaky...,"These are THE worst diapers I have ever used. I have never had soooo many leaks, soaked through diapers, messes all over my son, in his 28 months of life, than I have with this pack of Pampers Diapers. I will never buy Pampers again & will share my opinion to others."
4,Stays Dry Longer,"I have tried Kirkland and Huggies and this is my favorite diaper so far. My baby is 6 months old now and we use this as overnight diaper. It keeps his bottom dry for around 8 hours. This is also the cheapest overnight diaper I have found so far. With amazon mom and automatic reorder, the price beats most of the other diapers out there.Why I gave 4 instead of 5 - When it gets really wet, it will bunch up and hang down and leak occasionally."
5,This was a prompt and cost effective answer for busy moms,"This was a great option for diapers.It easy, quick, and they come right to your door!"
4,best diapers,these are most absorbent diapers and they never smell. i got the best price from amazon.
3,Pretty good for use,"Im not too happy with this product. I would personally have preferred Swaddlers or even Huggies. The problem with baby dry is the side leakage - there are high chances for it. There are no elastic type material on the sides that can make it cling on to the baby's back side. The other 2 products I mentioned above do. So if your baby poops (liquid poop) quite a bit, this may not be useful. For me, my baby started going once or twice a day, so this diaper works."
2,Does not have the flex tabs,"I had to return these. I bought 3 boxes, they've only taken 1 back so far. These don't have those flex tabs so they're like those cheap Huggies. The picture is rather misleading."
1,chemical can cause a reaction,"We usually put our baby in cloth diapers, but we do keep a stash of disposables on hand for trips and emergencies. I really wish pampers would go back to offering their usual 'cruiser' style diapers without the baby-dry. Our child has had a bad reaction to them-- she gets diaper rash almost immediately."
1,I hate these diapers,"I like Pampers but the baby dry has got to go, it has no give to the sides and DD leaked through every one of them."
1,pampers fell apart,I was very dissapointed in the quality of the last batch of pampers that I bought. 1/4 of the diapers fell apart as I was putting them on my daughter. I switched to Huggies because of this and have not bought any more pampers.
5,fast shipping.,"I notice so many people complain the shipping problems, I just want to tell my experience, I ordered it on 22,Oct,2004, and received on 27,Oct,2004. What a fast shipping!!!"
1,Worst diapers ever,"These diapers are terrible. They leak in the front, through the diaper! How does that even happen? My 6 month old needed a new one every two hours, otherwise it would leak and soak his clothes. Putting him in one for bedtime was a joke. 12 hours? No way. We had to buy a case of Swaddlers for nighttime so he wouldn't soak his PJ's at night. Don't waste your money- get the Swaddlers, they're fantastic!"
1,Deducted fundings even if I hadn't finalized the order!,"Started an order, which I never completed. Looked at my card and they had withheld the amount for the order, which I never completed! Called them, and they confirm that I haven't placed an order, but they are unable to credit my account in another 10 days! This was on a gift card!The customer service agent promised to take care of it first thing and he even stated that he was going to email me immediately the next morning. Two days later, after no email, I called and they have no idea of my issue, and we start over again with the talk about the 10 days. Noone seems to know why they've taken over $200 from the card."
3,Why Pampers??,"We have been buying Fitti recently for $0.19 per pad. Just as good as Pampers BD any day!! Fitti also has wetness indicators and no over powering fragance that is undesirable to some.Fitti Mega Baby Diapers, Size 4, 52 Count (4-Pack) (208 Count"
2,Disappointed,"These are a great deal in terms of price, but I am very disappointed as these diapers leak bad! And we are stuck with them now as there are 192 of them to go through. We've never experienced such a problem with Huggies... I don't know what happened to Pampers, as they were better quality earlier. It seems that the Diaper is much thinner, and there is not enough of the filling to absorb the pee..."
3,Does the job!,I have been using these diapers since my daughter was born and what I like about them is that they are super absorbent. My daughter has a lot of blowouts and I think they would be much worst if she wasn't wearing these diapers.
2,Quality of Pampers Dry has decreased dramatically,"I was a huge fan of Pampers Baby Dry. With my first child, I faithfully used the Pampers Baby Dry diapers for over two and half years with no complaints at all. I recommended them to friends and family members with babies. With my second child, who is now one year old, I returned to Baby Dry since they worked so well with my first. I don't know what they changed about the diapers, but the diapers continuously explode. I don't leave them on for longer than two hours at a time. Sometimes, the diaper feels completely dry and it still has exploded. The inside of the diaper is also irritating to my son's skin. I am tired of vacuuming up clumps of diapers. This happens to at least one diaper a day. I'm done. I am cancelling my subscription tonight and returning the last box which I haven't opened."
3,So-so,"I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash. Overall I wouldn't get these again. Go with the Pampers Swaddler diapers."
2,Go with pampers swaddlers,"I bought these thinking that there couldnt be that much of a difference between pampers and pampers swaddlers. I was wrong. The diapers just feel very cheaply made, the outside is a different material that is rough and the diapers seem to swallow up my 10lb baby. As for absorbancy, they are ok, better than the huggies and so far no accidents up the back, but I will not buy them again."
2,not what i ordered,"This is not what i oredered, but this is the third time they continue to send them to me, dont know why"
2,Poor quality - leaking,"The swaddlers are wonderful diapers, never had any problems, however, the Dry Baby diapers are terrible. We have gone though one box of them, and still have another one to go before we switch over to cloth (this is not the reason we are switching to cloth). My son has woken up several nights in a row completely wet and we've been having to change the sheets. They leak horribly. Even daycare hates them. We've had so many blowouts as well. They are incredibly thin and cheap feeling."
2,Okay....but not for my baby,"Some people may have no issues with these diapers, however, my little girl probably leaks in these once a day if not multiple times. I've tried everything making sure that the diaper is on just right or immediately changing her when I ""hear"" her go. NOTHING WORKS - I change her outfit multiple times a day and not for the fun of it. So it is back to Swaddlers for us.....I don't know why I ever changed."
4,pampers works best....,seems like pampers works best for my son- we tried other brands and they didnt work as well. definitely sticking with pampers!
1,12 hour relief?!,"We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
5,good choice,I used a coupon 2$ off. good price. I look forward to better offer next time ro so. maybe... df
2,Not a Fan!,I have been using Pampers Cruisers and wanted to try Baby Dry to see how they worked. They are fine for during the day but horrible for at night. My little girl woke up cold due to her diaper didn't hold in what it should have overnight which made her onesie soaked in the morning. Will NOT buy anymore Baby Dry...Wondering if maybe I can exchange????
2,Ok product,Not the latest product. Does not have wet line indicator like the new ones. You need to keep on checking at the diaper to find out if it is wet.
4,Really good wipes for the price,Cheap and good. Really good wipes for the price..smooth and strong. I recommend it to any age baby or child.
5,I love Pampers Baby Dry,"Pampers Baby Dry diapers are amazing. They absorbe everything and do just what they say, stay dry. None of those little jelly beads like in other diapers. They hold up to their name. They also smell wonderful with that fresh baby powder scent. Thisa is a great purchase and a great deal."
5,diapers,I save from .04 to.07 per diaper (depending on sizes I have autoshipped and mr mom deductions) as opposed to walmart's price. This adds up to a minimum savings of $7.68 per box up to well over $10 per box on smaller sizes. I have 3 in diapers.
2,Could be a lot better!!!,"Where do I start, how about I hate these diapers!! This gel stuff leaks out of them, all the time. They don't last long on active babies. Not to mention that I have to clean up leakage. Try another brand please!!"
4,Awesome for over nights!,My LO is 3 1/2 months old and is primarily breastfed with 1 bottle of formula a day. I started using the baby dry diapers a few weeks ago ONLY during the night time. And they are awesome! Now my little one rarely poos during the night time now so these baby dry diapers are awesome for me! Most nights they last the whole night and his clothes are still dry.
5,Very Comfortabke for the little ones,Pampers are the best for your little ones. The diaper absorb the moisture very well and keep kids skin dry. Surely recommend it.
1,They leak when regular swaddler diapers don't,"I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good."
3,Not bad for the price,The only thing that I was disappointed in was that these diapers didn't have the blue line wetness indicator. Otherwise the diapers did their job!
5,They did what diapers do...,What can I say...they performed their duties as expected. I like the Pampers diapers and will continue to use them.
5,What a deal!,"I have tried many types of diapers on my five children and Pampers are by far my favorite! They provide the best leak proof coverage and are slim enough that people have thought my older kids were already potty trained. With 30% off through Amazon Mom, these diapers are even cheaper than Parent's Choice. And they are delivered straight to your door! You can't beat that!"
5,Subscribe & Save Really Works!!!,"Love the Baby Dry diapers w/o dry max! Cruisers have the new dry max which broke my son's little bottom out with sore like blisters. Glad Pamper's is still making this on w/o dry max!Best part about his diaper box was the price! With subscribe and save program and signing up for amazon mom I will get 30% off diapers and free shipping. This price simply cannot be beat, even at membership clubs!Great job amazon! Diapering baby just got cheaper!"
1,New Design Leaks,"Loved the old design - my baby stayed dry through the night. Now, every morning he is soaked. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I didn't mind paying a premium price for the old design - it was phenomenal. The new design does not compare. I have switched to Luvs."
5,Good one ..,Quality as usual good .. very goodBest thing is cost - Lowest anywhere when you take advantage of 10$ off of 49$
3,Not good as I expect from Pampers,"Got it last month, usable. Sometimes, a few tiny white articles leaked out and stuck to my kid's thigh, never saw that from Pampers bought from store. I cancelled my next shipment."
2,Not that great,"Will not buy again, save your money and just buy LUVS, the only advantage the baby dry have is that they smell good. We went thru almost twice as many diapers trying to keep our baby dry.lol"
5,no issues here,"I have used pampers since my 10 month old was born. Initially I used the swaddles sensitive, which was great because they had the strip that changed colors when the baby is wet. But now I use the baby dry and have been very happy. Pampers came highly recommended to me, and I highly recommend them to other Moms!"
2,Pampers Baby Dry,"I've been using the Pampers brand since my daughter was born. I've tried Luvs, Huggies, and store brand and they all didn't work. She was using Swaddlers until she got to size 4 and I bought these. They SUCK. The pamper seems harder and the strip on the inside isn't as long. And to top it all off, it gave more poor child a rash. Luckily I didn't get stuck with all these pampers because a friend of mine used these on her daughter and they were fine. I'll be switching to the sensitive brand since they come in swaddlers."
3,Missing the yellow wetness detection stripe,"Still the great diapers we've grown to expect from Pampers, but I wish there was some way of knowing whether or not the diapers possessed the wetness detector strip. I'm neither used to nor fond of the squeeze test, so I much prefer the visual (in addition to the inevitable vocal) signs."
1,Hate it!!!,"At first, I thought it was just one or two diapers that have sand like in them but it's actually the whole box of diapers that have sand in EVERY DIAPER. But I willing to give it another try. Unfortunately, the 2rd and 3rd boxes were still the same (still have tons of sand like in every diaper). The changing table and crib were filled with tiny sand like everytime I changed my baby diaper. It's freaking me out cause my baby is super active and she's at the stage where she puts everything in her mouth. So, no more Pamper Baby Dry for me."
1,Horrible diapers,"I did not like these diapers at all! They leaked at night and even during the day. As soon as my 10 month old daughter peed in them, these diapers hung to the knees."
