3,Not as good as Back to basics.,"As a singer I use Christina's material for my vocals. I don't love her music through and through but adore the song's Beautiful, Ain't no other man, Hurt and Candyman but all the other filler music is not usable for me and my vocals. Christina has a very sharp voice. It might do her best to do some more soft to the ear stuff but who am I? She still is an awesome singer though! This album only has one decent song, thats why I think I got it so cheap on Amazon."
5,Flawless,"This is probably one of if not THE BEST album i've ever heard. track for track this album is phenomenal. it's beatiful, it's vulnerable, it's endearing, it's amazing.let's hope she keeps making music like THIS. if so, she'll be around for a long, long time."
5,How dare you??,"To whoever said that Christina is a bum and must die, you suck bigtime!!!! She's so very talented and her lyrics and voice are the best thing in the whole world! This is such a great album and you say Norah Jones, celine Dion are better than her??? GoD!! You must listen to Ms.Jones only if you are suffering from a severe case of Insomnia! Her album is so boring. I do not understand why Norah Jones fans come and rate Britney and Christina's albums. You're wasting your time. This is a great Cd!"
5,The True Princess of Groove,"Christina rocks! I buy a lot of CD's, and this one is by far the best I've heard in many years, by ANY artist out there. Christina has the voice of an angel, and unlike her last CD, which was pop flavored throughout, the music on ""Stripped"" is intelligent, thoughtful and deep. Great grooves, great melodies, amazing harmonies and probably one of the best produced CD's I've ever heard. I often find myself stopping in my tracks just to really listen to what she is doing with her amazing voice. Christina captivates me, not only by her unique beauty, but by her incredible control of what makes great music."
1,What is this?,"this is more of what I hate. Bad singers, who are only there for their looks.Honestly, these songs are some of the worst songs I've ever heard, and I've heard some horrinle songs! This cd is really bad and so is Christina, So DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!"
5,That girl is BAD.,"Amazing lyrics, AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING voice, amazing beats...What else do u want??? It's hard for me to imagine that this Christina is the one that was part of the whole bubble gum pop phase...She has grown and changed TREMENDOUSLY, it's shocking...Props for her, she's been getting loads of respect for such an amazing album."
3,One good song - the rest dont do her justice.,She needs better material - try her newer albums. There is one great song on this = get it using amazons mp3 store.
2,Umm...,Lets get this staight..Christina is trying to hard to be sexy. She's not goodlooking and I dont see why little girls look up to her. I dont understand it. I will admit though She had a beautiful voice but her music isnt all worth listening to. I respect her singing voice to be honset but I am not big on the pop music and the little kids going all crazy over her.
3,Stripped???not an original title,"This Album is huge...it has lot of songs, and just some of them are good! Christina loves to scream...everything is going well, but then she starts screaming..bah!I'm gonna review my favourites:I'm ok is a very emtional song, you can hear pain in her voice!Voice Within looks like a mariah carey song...i like it!Impossible is a good song, it has the alicia keys feeling, but the singing kind annoys me...Walk away is a jazzy one, and is my personal favourite!Although i'm tired of it, beautiful is a beautiful song!I only like 5 songs out of 18!!!!!!!But those 5 are very good, that's why i'm giving this cd 3 stars"
3,"Excelent CD, Awful Lyrics","This is totally better than Christina's first album, but it is tottaly disgusting. Gosh,...I reccomend buying this album, If you're over eighteen."
5,christina aguilera stripped,"I totally love the album...even though she reveals more of herself not only dropping clothes but she opens her heart and soul to her fans. Such songs that stand out on the album are ""Beautiful"" and ""I'm Ok"". I know she is trying to show who she really is but her music really stands out on this and that is what really counts...if you haven't picked up this album then you really should. There'll never be another one like it. Her talents are really beginning to show through and I think this is one of her best. 2 thumbs up Christina!!! - Morgan"
4,Okay1,"The young lady just wants to have a sexy look with those Micro Mini Skirts.Her songs are okay On ""Stripped"". [...]Anyway The CD is decent. I thoughtshe would continue making songs that had punchsuch as the material from her first album. Songs such as Geniein a bottle, and others. I still believe her early work was betterthan this, but still recommended it. This is the girlthat beat out Brittany Spears for a Grammy."
2,complete crap,"i got this album ages ago and i hate it!! i think thats its fake and winey!! christina has got a great voice but i prefer her first album!!!! britney has got a better new album becauseits upbeat and funky!! but stripped is slow and boring apart from dirrty!!! Every interview christina keeps on sayin da same thing!!! ""this album refeclted me and wat i was goin though"" but who cares!!! shes said dat alot its made stripped seem pointless!!! sorry aguilera but spears wins the new album round!!!"
3,i have heard that before...,a nice album but its all 'cut and shut' of other songs and if you dont believe me listen to the voice within i swear its made of two song that were out long ago....
3,Good and Bad,"I borrowed this from my local library to check it out (if you'll pardon the pun). I enjoyed the more upbeat tracks such as Dirrty, Fighter and the one about first love (I forget the title). Christina has a magnificent voice, but she would have much greater impact if there was some variation in it - it isn't necessary to be so loud and vulgar all the time.The more mellow songs, with the exception of Beautiful, all sounded the same to me. A couple of them were pretty good, but in the end were killed by the fact that they seemed to go on forever. This is one of those CDs that I get or borrow to rip the tracks off of it that I like (maybe half of the disc, if that), and then return it or sell it."
4,"Heartfelt, more mature","What makes this album so great is taht Christina had input on almost all of the songs. So they are a direct reflection of what she was going through at the time. I loved her last studio album, but the songs on Stripped are less manufactured.My favourites are Beautiful, Cruz, Can't hold us down and The Voice Within."
5,Stripped in the most beautiful way!,"Christina Aguilera's brand new album Stripped is certainly a diary brought to life for everyone's ears to experience. With touching tracks such as: Beautiful, Soar, Cruz, and I'm Okay this album is truly inspiring. The rock ballads are so wonderful such as: Fighter and Makeover (Which is my favorite track on the album). When Christina sings you feel her happiness, and emotion going into it. She displays her most darkest secrets in this album, and shows the world that she can be an artist just as Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, and Madonna are. Stripped will get you dancing,thinking, and inspired. If you are in the mood for a touching album please buy Stripped because it is in my opinion the best album of 2002, and I doubt any new release can top it!"
2,"Better title: ""Stupidity & Shallowness In L.A.""","I wasn't really expecting a lot from this and that's what I got. I'm not criticizing the film's director/producer because he showed everything like it really is in the gay porn industry: a bunch of empty headed, shallow, narcissistic twits. The egomania (Johnny Law needs to quit reading his press releases) is nothing more than a cover for insecurity and damaged psyches. I get an overwhelming impression that most of the ""actors"" got into it because they figured doing porn would make them feel better about themselves or they might gain some approval - whether they want to admit it or not.The only shred of normalcy (such that it is for a porn actor) & being level headed was Cole Tucker. I got the impression from him that he did porn because it was just something he wanted to do, enjoyed doing, and yet had no illusion that it was a gateway to better things. Everyone else in the film just struck me as pathetic."
1,Porn life,"Well, it's about guys who make their living through sex. Either by internet, movies, etc. Interesting, but for renting only. A few nudity scenes."
5,Neatest multi tool ever!,"I love this tool. First, they are very useful. Second, they are so much sturdier than the old swiss army knives. Third... It is a leatherman. It features countless tools, each one of them being more useful than the other. Plus the pliers are such a great addition! You just can't beat that! I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
5,Good!,"If you haven't heard this, I can't do anything for you.. Its really good! Crawl out from your rock and get this.. Its a good 'un!"
4,A good starting place for the interested novice,"This book is a good starting place for those just entering the world of Tribal Law. This a college freshman level book. Not for heavy-duty legal scholars. I like it because it shows the clear lineage of Treaties, the Constitution, and key US Supreme Court decisions from the earliest days (Colonial days) to now."
5,A Visual Feast for the Cactophile,"This is a terrific book devoted entirely to Cacti (no succulents are shown. The photographs are superb and many of them show plants in their natural habitat.Each plant description gives brief cultural requirements for the plant shown and these are qite adequate but this is not really what this book is all about. The book is a visual feast of photographs, many of the plants quite rare in cultivation.The book also uses what may be a unique form of layout, rather than the plants being shown in alphabetical order, they are classified according to their geographical origin.There is also a place in the book for hybrids and specialist varieties. next to each plant photograph throughout the book there are symbols for light requirement and overwintering."
2,Mistitled Book,"This book has very little content regarding good class design. There is one small chapter detailing a few Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Lazy Init) and the rest of the book is just explaining the way C# and the CLR work.If you are already a developer in some other language, this book will get you up to speed on C# very well, and is a good reference book, however it is not a Class Design book at all.I found no real information regarding design guidelines, reusabilty, error handling etc."
2,Alfred Dunhill Desire blue,"I could not believe that this cologne scent did not linger, and it is very subtle as well. Really disappointed with this buy."
3,Honeywell usually does better,Unit is wobbly and hard to control.Instructions should be reviewed for clarity.Air movement is fine.Other products from this company have better quality.What is happening to this reliable firm?
2,Great fan....while it works,I purchased this fan and it was amazing for about four weeks. After that the oscillating motor went out. I exchanged the fan for a new one and again the oscillting motor went out after about four weeks. After that I switched to a Lasko fan and it has been running strong for eight months.
3,Lots Of Air,"This fan moves a lot of air and quietly. However it is not very stable due to thin plastic base and support shaft. No Ionizer what-so-ever. The light comes on but I don't notice any ozone smell (which is what I wanted.) If the Ionizer worked I would have given it four stars. Very cheap remote, mine broke putting the batteries in. For fifty dollars I'm happy."
4,Works well,It cools the room quite well so I don't have to use the a/c at night. It's not loud but there is white noise. I think it actually drowns out other noise when I'm sleeping.
4,"Powerful fan, but takes for ever to cool room","I got this fan to manage my bedroom temperature, but it takes forever for it to reach the temperature I set it at (72 degrees). I had it on for 15 hours straight and it still didn't reach 72 degrees, and this is with my air conditioning elsewhere in my apartment being set to 66. It is a good fan overall, not sure how the ionization feature works, and I am pleased with it, I just wished it cooled the room faster."
1,Great but how to clean?,"Fan is impossible to clean in a dusty area. I bought one - thought it was great - and bought another. However, I live in the city and there's a lot of dust. Once dust makes it pass the filter, the fan is impossible to clean. So, they're both in the dumpster now."
1,broken,"It arrived broken, with not only loose blades rattling around inside but the entire trunk of blades broken off from the rotating base. This made it impossible to use or fix."
5,Great Fan,"This fan meets all my needs, nothing bad or great about it. Purchase with Amazon Sucks, it took a very long time for the item to arrive, took almost a month."
5,"lots of features for the price, works well so far","I got this fan to circulate air in an isolated room in our research lab. We had limited space so we needed a tower model. This unit works very well. The high setting moves quite a bit of air and the timer function is really useful. The built in thermometer is handy too. We actually ended up using the fan by our desks for a while first because we liked the breaze function so much. That feature isn't too common on fans for $45. Overall this fan is a great value and has worked very well so far. The construction isn't exactly confidence inspiring, but it does everything it's supposed to do very well."
2,Had High hopes for this Fan.,"Some good things to say is this fan is very quiet even on it's high setting. It has a breeze function that sounds like it damages the motor of this fan, it's very hard to adjust the settings of this fan, the way they designed it, a normal friend or visitor would not know how to change the speed from high to low unless they read the instructions.With that being said i am returning because this machine is also putting out a plastic like smoke smell, i was told could be harmful. I'm getting the Lasko 52"" Oscillating Pedestal Fan which I've heard nothing but good news about, plus its easy to work anyone can use it :)"
1,light weight plastic doesnt blow enough,"Yes, we are having a heat wave, but this is cheaply made, putting together the plastic base, one part literally bent . It did still fit togeher and I have it on the highest setting, and it is supposed to cool a large room; I have it in the small bedroom on the highest setting, having followed all instructions, and it's like a small puff of cool air.Previous tabletop desktop fans have been much better; it looks more streamlined, but provides very little in the way of air circulation unfortunately"
4,Great Tower Fan - One Annoying Problem,"This is a great fan, it sufficiently circulates the air in my room, and keeps it cool. The fan has a filter in it and that helps a lot to keep dust floating around in my room. Everyother month or so, just take a vacuum to it and it is as good as new. Just one annoying thing, if you set the fan to its lowest setting, and then you find that you want the fan to be on the highest setting, you need to cycle through, and that turns the fan off, resetting the fan. Other than that, this is a great fan."
2,Wish it worked as good as it looks,Bought this fan based on the great reviews it has received. Big Mistake. Use it for a fan in the bedroom year round just to circulate the air. It is not even powerful enough to do that. On the stand it is very low to the ground (about waist high) so if you have a high bed as I do you wont feel it. Remote is awful & poorly designed. The Fan has a lot of buttons that do nothing. It looks nice but dont waste your money.
2,Nothing special ...,"I ordered it and had high expectations after reading the other reviews. I have the desktop version and it is insane! The low speed is way too much wind for me usuallyThis one however is nothing special. And is actually a bit short which is annoying, i have to keep it on a chair to have it at a good level.It does blow wind, but i expected better performance."
4,This fan BLOWS!,"I bought one of these fans locally and I liked it so much that I ordered another one from Amazon.Here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:1. It pushes a lot of air - I can get a nice breeze from as far as 25 feet away.2. It doesnt take up a lot of room.3. It is not ugly like many fans are.4. The remote control with flashlight is a nice feature even though I rarely use it. For the person who complained about one LED being burned out straight out of the box. Only one LED is for the flashlight. The other is for the remote control functions and doesnt illuminate.Cons1. The breeze feature is kind of annoying because of the fluctuation of the noise level.2. You have to hold the remote in a specific postition to make it work. If the fan is oscillating, its hard to find that position."
2,I thought I had found the fan of my dreams,This was the best fan ever... but after about a year it started to make a rattling noise and is now only usable during the day when we are not trying to sleep.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this fan. When running, it gives off a ""plastic"" odor. I'm hoping it will fade with time. Also, the remote control has a sloppy feel to the buttons and sometimes it takes me several pushes to change the speed of the fan. It does run fairly quiet, which is a good thing."
2,Not for air just for looks,I bought this fan based on previous reviews saying moves lot of air but its not true its just a show peace.In high speed it self don't feel that much air.
3,"So, what's the price?","I'm intrigued by the strong ratings for this product, but I wonder if the price is correct?? Web searches on this product (including model #) generally show prices ranging from $39.99 to about $89.99, yet this listing on Amazon shows $188.99. What's going on?"
3,Good fan - but noisy and malfunctioning!,"This fan is nice, but as other reviews mentioned, there seems to be something wrong with the power wiring. For no apparent reason, it often spins the fans really high when it's set to 'low' speed, and it's generally pretty noisy. Overall, I'm glad that I got this fan."
4,"Decent fan,but not blown away.","I liked the features and overall performance of the fan.The fan gives enoug breeze and air circulation if u have never used 10$ turbo fans.the traditional fans which i have been used of for 7 years,is now tough to be replaced by this fan.i am not getting that amount of air what i used to.so i want to give some time and see if i get used to this one before i return it.the ionizer functions or not i dont know.Is there any way you feel that.if any body knows please let me know.UPDATE:this fan is unable to satisfy my taste.the wind is not enough to keep me happy.i probably go back to my turbo fan."
3,What does the remote operate?,"This fan is pretty quiet and pretty efficient in blowing a nice breeze. My only concern is that the fan does not always respond to the remote. It could simply be a glitch with my machine but when I press the remote for operation, the red fan light blinks but no other response. The fan speed and oscillation don't change every time I push the button on the remote. Sometimes I have to push it repeatedly. Outside of those concerns, it is a pretty nice, fashionable fan."
3,It could have been better,"The fan worked great at first but, I've had this fan for 2 years and it only gets used during the summer when I'm home, so it only has several months of use. In that short amount of time used the on/ off switch has stopped working. I think they could have done a better job on 1 of the other controls. They put the Ionizer on the same button as the oscillator and to turn the Ionizer on with the remote, you have to catch it in mid cycle of it oscillating and it's easy to miss it. The remote is awkward to use. For what little use this fan has had it should have lasted longer."
4,Complete,"Great if shipped unbroken and with all parts intact.Amazon customer service slow to do what customer requested as far as a replacement label, but eventually came through. Still wrong though....understand English language better!!....Finally got product in working order after third attempt....."
2,if it only worked,I had this fan about a year and it worked good. I give it to my elderly mother till she passed away. I put it in my bed room and used it for a month and it stopped working. it went dead wont even light up don't know why. when it did work it worked very good put out allot of air.
4,Well made fan and quiet rotation but loud fan,"Overall, I think this is a good fan, however the lowest fan speed is too loud and it is hard to tell which speed you have selected. The indicator screen only shows temperature rather than speed level so you have to guess which fan speed you are currently using. That being said, I still think this a well made fan and will last years."
4,"good air flow, noisier than expected","This fan really moves air and fits well in the room it is in. Bought it based on reviews saying it was quiet, but it was noisier than expected. Does not seem to bother my son though."
4,"Well built, with a few flaws","I purchased this to replace another similar fan from a different manufacturer someone tripped over and broke. It is well built and the ion feature is very nice. HOWEVER, it is a good bit louder than my old similar fan while moving about the same amount of air. The other annoyance is that you can't set the timer properly from the remote. I want to be able to turn it on from the remote and set a 2-hour timer quickly but couldn't. :( Overall still a good fan - and it can move a lot of air. Nice height, looks good."
1,Returned the next day,"Very unstable. Developed a loud annoying rattle within 5 minutes of operation. Remote control was awkward to use. Didn't push air very well. In other words, a complete waste of money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HOT FAN,"Hot Fan you ask?Ya, can't get the temp down on this thing, it just blows hot air all night. stays at 84 degrees, no matter how low you put it. Very frustrating. and loud. Totally regret buying this."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"I purchased this fan for my son in Mass. on June 20. We are still waiting for the fan. There is a heat wave going on and it seems this fan is traveling across the US to get to him. At one point I got notice it had shipped from PA. Then went to Orlando Florida, then to Miami.. What the heck? My son lives in Mass. PA & MA are not even close to Florida. Not sure why they shipped that way but seems a waist of time and money especially in this heat. I gave them a P.O. Box because my sons neighbors steal all his mail/packages. Just recently they asked where they should ship it? Will never order anything from ""The Nerds"" again. Neeless to say I have had to order another one for him. The Nerds don't seem very intellient to me."
1,Fan Won't Turn on After 9 months,"I purchased this fan about 9 months ago, and everything was great for 9 months. I used it maybe twice a week, not too much, so it was definitely not overworked.Then one day it just stopped turning on... No clue what happened.. checked the power cord, tried different outlets, nothing... Just stopped working.Great $50 down the drain, guess I need to go out and buy a new one..Not happy."
3,Okay product,"The ""high"" speed feels more like a med. speed and the amt. Of money that ur paying I would have assumed it would deliver great power but it does not. What i cant stand is that u can adjust the temp. At which the fan will deliver its air quality, it seems like that feature is just for show cause even when i place it on 60 degrees the fan's air is NOT cooler! It's good for small spaces not large do to the power of deliverance of this fan. It's easy to put together, looks sleek , is quiet even on it's so call high speed, but that's about it... This fan is not the greatest and if I would have known what I know now I would not purchase it."
3,Fast enough but not slow enough..,I have 2 of these fans. They certainly move a lot of air. The problem is that even the slowest setting is too fast. I sleep better with my air conditioning unit set to fan - this one results in waking up with my eyes feeling dry and tired..
5,Great Fan!,Got this as a gift for my dad and he loves it. My fiance and I had put it together and had no problems doing it. It's pretty self-explanatory when you look at it so the manual wasn't useful for that. It looks really nice and it works well without much noise. My dad thought it was super expensive (it sort of looks like it would cost about $100). I originally bought this several months ago and I paid about $56 with shipping. Both my fiance and I wished we had it for ourselves!
3,decent fan but the remote is strange,"the fan looks classy with the chrome trim and pushes a good amount of air. however, the remote acts so weird. you push the button, and the light on top of the fan lights up to confirm your push, but half the time it doesnt even respond. i have to push teh button sometiems 10 times to get it to register. other than that, a decent overall fan."
1,Just another disposable fan,"Bought one of these new on a clearance sale and the oscillate function didn't work out of the box. Honeywell (actually a company called KAZ that must have bought rights to the Honeywell name for consumer goods) would not fix it and when I attempted to disassemble it I found that I couldn't get to the oscillation mechanism leaving me with a broken fan. I was also not impressed by the rickety stand with just a few plastic prongs and one screw holding it on.It's sad too because I'm sure if they'd spent another $10/fan to design and build it properly it would be a fine product as it really pushes the air out. However as it is the build quality is quite poor and I suspect even a good one is unlikely to last more than a season or two before something breaks. Mine's probably going to the Goodwill and I'll be shopping elsewhere for a fan, sorry."
5,"Works great, looks great!","Just ordered this for the Master Bedroom. Does a great job and I love the thermostate functionality. I always use to have to man the remote at night when it would cool down and the fan was still running. No more! It's not as quiet as I was hoping but it's fine on low. Our place is very quiet at night so it's easy to focus on any noises. As for looks, it's pretty slick. Definitely more solid then most fans. I do wish that the display would light up. Useless at night if you want to see the temp and other settings when lights are off. But, this doesn't take off a star as the price is still good for what you get. The fan flashlight is super helpful to have next to the bed. Don't have to wake up the wife to find your way around the halls.Great product! I'd buy again!"
4,Great product.,Awesome product. WORKS GREAT! Wish it was able to push a little bit more air through. Also not a fan of the steel border around the vent but that is just a preference. The only other down side was the remote had to be pointed very exactly. But minus those few drawbacks....it works Great!
3,"Remote is great, but fan is loud!","While some of the features of this fan are great, this fan is loud! I'd much rather have a quieter fan, but I'm stuck with this one until it quits!"
5,Seriously... what an awesome fan.,"The setup was super easy, didn't need any tools. Looks great, and works really well. Also, love the remote which has a flash light. I sleep with the thing running all night, so it comes in handy if I need it."
4,honeywell cooling tower,"I bought this product for my daughter's college dorm during the hot weather.. She liked it, but she expected it to cool like a/c. The base is very flimsy which I didn't like. It does have a lot of features and is quiet."
3,"FAN 3 stars, REMOTE 1 star",I bought this fan for the remote advantage. Do not expect the remote to work just because you push a button. You will have to WORK at pointing the remote at the fan and catching the fan in JUST the right position for this remote to work. Each button on the remote is used for more than one function so it will take a moment (not a second or two) to get the fan set like you want. My husband had no interest in trying to master themovements needed to use the remote and my aging mother would never be able tomake use of this remote because of arthritis in her hands.
1,Hope you dont have to send it back!,"Cross your fingers that you don't have to send it back or deal with customer service.The fan was damaged when I received it. The company instructed me to return it to them at my expense for a credit. Sounds fine so far.However, it will cost $45 to ship via UPS ground from NJ to PA. So, I'd have to pay $45 out of pocket for them to give me a credit for $49--no option for a replacement fan. I am extremely disappointed in this type of customer service."
2,Worked great - then broke,I purchased this fan in the beginning of October - it has been about two weeks and now the fan will not oscillate! It worked great for two weeks now it is broken :(
3,"Fan works great; plastic ""body"" is cheap","This fan is quiet and yet has good air movement in the room. Putting it together was a super challenge, though. The parts (base to fan body) would not go together so I called Customer Service and a nice young man agreed to send me another part. The new part (the base) arrived quickly and I was finally able to get it attached to the fan. But beware...the base is cheap cheap cheap! One wiggle and the base comes off. As long as the fan sits still in one place, it will cool you nicely...just don't plan on moving it around your house!"
4,Great Fan,This is a great fan. I use it every night while we sleep. It puts out a lot of air and oscillates over a wide area. The only problem I have is that there is one button to control oscillation and ionization. It makes it difficult to adjust the oscilation just a minor bit as you have to hit the button multiple times and it oscillates rather quickly.
3,So so,This product is so-so. It has lots of features but just doesn't seem to provide that blast of cold air that I was looking for. It feels more like a temperature stabilizer than something that makes me feel chilled.
4,great fan,"this fan is great, in the summer i actually get cold if i keep this fan on.my mom came over and was so impressed, i got her on as well.. and of course she loves it... only problem i had was taking off that giant sticker on the base... trying to get off all that sticky stuff was pain... other than that. .it's great..."
5,BEST FAN!!!,"This is a very good fanVery QuitNice Feautures like ionizer, 3 speed, breezeVery Good Looking FanDosent take up much space*not very strong windwashable filterremote with built in flash lightEast Assembly no tools reqiredthermostateAir comes out coolernot much to say thats negative*= Negative"
5,Great Fan!,"I love this fan! It works great. I used it a lot this summer and it worked very well. The oscillation is a nice feature as well as the ionizer. I especially love the remote control, it came in handy every time I was lounging on the sofa watching TV and didn't want to get up. You can control everything with the remote: the oscillation, ionizer, speed, and even an extra feature which replicates a natural breeze. I definitely recommend this fan. I didn't think it would be as powerful as a circular fan, but it is; and it's much more attractive looking than those big round fans. A definite best buy!"
2,Stopped oscillating after a few weeks,"The fan worked great for the first few weeks, then out of the blue the thing decides to stop oscillating. The oscillating feature was the reason I bought it in the first place, so I am not happy with the hassles of having to return it. I expected more from Honeywell..."
1,terrible cd,I bought this thinking Oh its master their one of the origional death metal bands it should be good wrong stay away from it its not all bad the guiars are heavy its the drummer every song he uses the same beat and the snare sounds the same throughout the cd it wears on you like lars ulrich in st. anger although nothing can be that bad but you'll get it classic master is and on the seventh day god created master mainly cause he has paul masvidal on guitar who is from cynic one of the best death metal bands of all time and he was on death's human album anyway stay away from this horrible cd
1,revlon is no longer making any Ultima products,"I haven't tried this. I recently remembered that I used to use my mother'sRevenescence cream moisturizer (made by Charles of the Ritz)on special occasionswhen I was a teen. I adored it. Searching the internet I found that that is no longer made, but people said that the Ultima 11 chr cream concentrate is the closest thing to it. However, I called Revlon & they said they no longer make it, & they said it was last made in 4/08 & has a shelf life of 3 yrs. So, ifit's sold anywhere on the internet it would already be expired, & obviously Amazon won't be carrying it. Just thought I'd let people know so they won't be waiting for it to come in. I'm so disappointed. Does anyone know of anything else that's close to Revenescence?"
5,attention all dragon lovers!,"When I saw this book, I just knew I would like it. Has everything you want to know about dragons, including a cool recording sheet for all of your sightings. You will learn how to tell apart a friendly dragon from an unfriendly dragon. Also includes tons of pictures! All of a dragon's powers, and their personalities. You'll learn how to tell if a dragon has been where you are, how they breathe fire, and soooo much more. Since I' ve read this book, I'm a huge dragon lover."
1,Congratulations! you have reached the absolute bottom!,"Hands down, the absolute worst film ever to receive some sort of public distribution...NIGHT OF HORROR is so talentlessly and unprofessionally crafted that it becomes an almost surreal, otherworldly experience. The eventless odyssey of an entirely nondescript group of friends traveling various intersates in a motor-home culminates in the unearthing of a figural ceramic skull, a guy in a Civil War uniform whispering things you can't even decipher, and a lengthy home-movie insert depicting a battle reenactment. There is no bloodshed. There's not a single [...], preky or bodacious, to be seen. There is not a fleeting moment of suspense, terror, or humor of even an unintentional kind.So jaw-droppingly horrid, it's actually worth a look...you *WILL* be astounded."
3,this is not the Enforcers I was looking for,"I bought this because it said it was directed by Mere Smith, who was involved with some of Joss Whedon's shows. I wanted ""the Enforcers""with AndyHallett, James Marsters, and Amber Benson, (of Chance, Angel, and/or Buffy fame).None of those stars are on this, and I can't even find a Mere Smith credit, unless she went by Katie Smith on here.What I got, is just a typical A&E; historical documentary, this one is about the history of the U.S. military police. It doesn't stand out to me as anything special, but it did have the Lackland Air Force base...which is not far away."
5,The ORIGINAL manual for hand rolled silk flowers!,"I discovered hand rolled silk flowers in the 1980's through a class at my local craft store. Dottie Rutecki's book was used as a reference and for its patterns. When made properly using her instructions, the flowers are exquisite and very real looking. Over the years I misplaced her book and recently scanned the internet for ""hand rolled silk flowers"". I can honestly say that nothing I saw came close to mimicking her work. I purchased her book again! If you want to learn the art of hand rolled silk, this is the book for you."
3,Could be better for the price,"For the price you could buy 20inch widescreen. I've had it for about 5 months now and the color is starting to fade. Sometimes the whole screen turns purple or pink. The touchscreen works great, after the detailed calibration it's awesome. There is too much glare in the sun, it would be nice if they could put some transflective technology into it. Overall, I give it a 3 out of 5."
5,just what i ordered,"I'm satisfied with the product. Delivered in a timely fashion. Clean and smooth lines, ready for use."
5,The brass rod was great,"The brass rod that I purchased was shipped quickly, packaged in a way that prevented damage, had a very good price, and was exactly what I wanted."
1,Lori Foster is the ACKNOWLEDGED author of this book...,I've read every Lori Foster book I can get my hands on and this book does not appear to have been written by the same author. The copyright does not belong to Lori Foster and she is listed as the acknowledged author only. I was very disappointed by the book.
3,Great book but disappointing aspects,"Lori Foster is one of my favorite authors. I first started reading this before I realized it was in a series titled the Maitland Maternity Series. I did not read the other books in the series and that did not cause problems following the main story line of this particular book, Married to the Boss. However, she adds a middle story line in the book that does not get finished with this book. I am assuming that this side story will be covered in other books. However, I was not interested in reading a 25 book series in order to find out what happens to the other characters. If you are just wanting a quick read, I would suggest another book by Lori Foster, Fallen Angels has an anthology of three of her novellas. If you are able to get your hands on the entire Maitland Maternity series and are up to reading all of them, this will be a good read for you."
5,Short But Sweet,"An excellent, if brief comp. The animals are of course one of the kings of sixties rock, it's a shame that they lost their mojo in the 70s and basically never got it back. Of course, this does not detract from the excellence of their 60s music, and this album will give you a fine sample of that. Every track smokes, highly recommended."
2,Not worthless,"I expected far more insights and tricks than this book provided. It provides basic scripting for what are typically basic tasks. There are a few gems in this book, but they are few and far between."
2,Beware of foreword promises,"The foreword assures you that the authors have posted scripts in http:\\www.rallenhome.com\booksWell, don't hold your breath. It says ""coming soon"" ( since mid 95) .If you expect the authors to answer your email seeking clarification you'll be disappointed.Julio Kuplinsky"
5,Wonderfuly Fun Movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's sweet and unassuming and just a good time. Had a hard day at the office and need a break-kind of movie.There really isn't all that much more to say - I know some people hate it - they probably just need to lighten up and enjoy the story. It's not supposed to be a study in the best acting, direction, or effects - it's just about a good time."
4,Waiting for the DVD on this gem.,"Miracles [VHS]Extremely funny in spots, but don't go into this one like a stuffed up sticky beak or you'll be disappointed. Terri Garr is her usual marvelous self and the rest of the cast play along for a really enjoyable time. Forget the story, it's nothing more than an excuse to make things happen, very funny things with a lot of off-beat lines that I find hilarious (""look for feet ground"").No DVD yet, so you have to suffer through old technology to watch this great little movie."
5,Yummy treat,"My puppy loves this! I got the chicken and the beef favors. It comes as filets but can be very easily broken into small treat size. I use it as meal toppers to mix with his dry food, and also a snack for him. I am glad to know also that he is getting high quality protein from this, not fillers."
4,Treats,Now we bought these cause we like to try to give our dogs something different. But they didn't like them. They would eat them but they are pretty picky. It seems they get use to one they and they don't want to change.
4,Delicious!!! My little one loved it!!!,She loved it. She asked for more all the time. The only thing is a little bit pricy for a little bag.
2,Dogs wouldnt eat it,"I purchased several kinds of these treats from the same company in hopes that the dogs would like at least one. Unfortunately, they didn't like any of them and I wound up tossing out $35 worth of treats. As all dogs have their own favorite foods, I cant really blame the Zuke products. BUT, it would really be better if they offered a ""sampler"" of their products in very small amounts so that you could test them on your dogs without spending a lot of money, and then possibly tossing it all out."
2,Expensive!,"There were exactly 8 treats in the bag I bought...that's almost $1 per treat! Sure, my dog loved them, but that's way too much to pay for dog treats. I expected the package to contain more."
5,TIGER LOVE LOVE LOVE TAMES A PITBULL,"OMG TIGER IS A PITBULL...THIS TREAT HERE IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING HE USUALLY WOULD RUN WILD AN CRAZY AN DO WHATEVER BUT WHEN I PULLED THIS TREAT OUT, OMG I AM SHOCKED..I GAVE HIM ONE AN WENT TO MY ROOM I CAME BACKAN TIGER WAS NOT BUDGING HE WAS JUST SITTING THERE STILL BY THE DOOR NOT DOING NOTHING. IWAS LIKE OMG TIGER IS OBEYING REALLY? ALL FROM THIS TREAT? WOW...AN SO ITESTED IT OUT SEE IF HE WOULD DO OTHER THINGS AN WOW HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR A TREAT...I AM AMAZED. ZUKES YOU ROCK!"
3,Merlin's review,"My dog ate the treat, but was not as excited about it as he is with his other treats. Please note that this is a LARGE piece, and may not be suitable for small to medium dogs. I would say the fillet is about 2 inch x 4 inch, but can be easily broken to be smaller pieces, and the color is a bright yellow."
5,Finally a treat he loves!,"Our dog doesn't like dog treats so we just buy him beef jerky, which isn't healthy at all. Someone gave a sample of these to him for Christmas, and once I opened the package, he went crazy. He ate all of them! So I am definitely going to order more."
1,Stale product,I've purchased this product at pet stores before and the filets are moist and have a nice texture. I recently opened my filets and they were dry and stale even though the expiration date states April 2013. I recommend you purchase at a local store so you can return if you have a similar issue.
2,Leaks and Stains,"Very disappointed. Purchased for my 3 year old daughter's birthday. The paints leaked and stained hands and table top. Do not intend on purchasing this brand again, nor recommending."
1,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Alex toys and was excited to try the dots and dashes paint set. It was messy and it stained my wooden table especially the purple one (even though it claims to be washable). My kids did not enjoy the experience and even threw their work in the garbage. My advice, get a different brand for dot and dashes paint."
2,Get the Do-A-Dot version of these instead,"We got these Alex paints and theDo-A-Dot Rainbow Art Set (Set of 6)at the same time, and the Do-A-Dots definitely win. We actually ended up tossing these after a couple of months rather than finishing them. The tubes were too thick and too stiff for my 2-year-old son to be able to squeeze easily. And they leaked - not a lot, but enough to get paint spread all around the room, which is a pain to track down and clean up even with washable paint. I do love the concept, and my son and I really enjoy playing with the Do-A-Dot version."
5,Perfect for little hands,"I bought this for my 2 year old and my 3 year old loves it even more. It's a great thing to pull out on a rainy day that doesn't make a big mess. I can go online and print out dot coloring sheets that go with it. I was worried that these would leak if the kids were too rough with them, but so far they have had no problems."
2,Don't go by the picture!!,The item in the picture it not what I got.I had the same problem ordering other items from the Amazon.com site.One other problem is there is no part number listed in the packing slip ( or online)to check it against.
1,WORST BAND EVER,"i dont know what this is or what is was supposed to be but its terrible. its more of a poor attempt at metal than hardcore.its boring,corny,generic, and predictable.hopefully this band stays upstate,maybe even continues north to canada as long as they stay outta the city."
5,Wow! Amazing coffee,This setup makes an amazing cup of coffee. A little bit of an extra step but worth it.Cons: A little expensive but if you like good coffee a worthwhile investment.
5,great great great!!,"Perfect for 2 cups of coffee! so easy to use, and reusable filter!looks pretty cool on my counter too :)love all hario products!"
3,"Great Bear, but doesn't sit up","My 1 year old daughter loves bear in the big blue house. She can say ""Bear"" better than Mommy or Daddy. This toy is great, it is soft and sounds just like bear when you squeeze his ear. The only Problem is that our bear is in a ""laying down"" pose all the time, he won't sit up. I don't know if it is just ours or not. Just be aware that he might not sit up and be as cute as in the picture."
4,Talking Bear in teh Big Blue House,"Package was shipped and received very fast. Item is cuter then the picture showed. Bear is so soft and very cuddly, which surprised me since he talks. I was very disappointed that in order to get Bear to work I had to replace that batteries because the ones that were in him had leaked."
4,Cute but ok bear,Bear in the big blue house is a great muppet show but this toy is just ok. very cute and sort of cuddly. my daughter played with it all of 3 seconds and went to play with a box from another toy. oh well. thought she would love it because she loved the show so much. hard to understand so of the things he says sometimes.
3,CUTE... BUT.....,"we had to return the first one to amazon because the batteries didnt work- then we received another and the batteries were also dead- so to replace these batteries was a real big pain, it wasnt a regular hearing aid battery. They cost me 12 dollars to replace these crazy batteries- and my son doesnt even play with bear. kind of disappointing. I do have to mention that I called customer service and they did credit me back the money for the batteries. thanks"
3,Bought for a friend.,I really cann't tell you much but what I can say is that my friends is very delighted with this toy. He bought it for his son. And he loves it. That is why I only gave it 3 stars.
2,Prick - self-titled (Nothing/Interscope) 2 1/2 stars,"This was Prick's first of just two releases,as I barely remember hearing about how this band was support act for the Nine Inch Nail's 'Downward Spiral' second leg of the U.S. tour.Prick was,basically one member-guitarist,vocalist&songwriter Kevin McMahon.Nothing to get too thrilled about,it's so-so industrial metal.A couple of the disc's decent cuts are ""No Fair Fights"",""I Got It Bad"" and ""I Apologise"".Just MIGHT appeal to some fans of God Lives Underwater,Gravity Kills and Stabbing Westward."
2,Average band with nothing original on the tracks,"The first thing that sticks out after listening to this cd is how similar the music is to NIN. After reading the liner notes I found that Trent Reznor produced more than 1/2 of the songs and it shows. It makes the cd feel like karoake. Guitar chords, electronic blips and drum beats all sound like they were taken from NIN downward spiral cd. If you are o.k. with that you may like the band. The singers voice sounds like David Bowie.A better choice for industrual music would be Ministry, Lords of Acid, KMFDM, and 9 Volt"
5,A Masterpiece,"I first discovered Prick and Kevin McMahon like almost everyone else through his NIN connection. Almost instantly this CD blew me away! All ten tracks on Prick's self-titled debut are extremely accessible and catchy, yet at the same time extremely complex and layered with collages of sound that will keep you listening for years. I have owned and listened to this CD since 1995 and I still put it on at least once a week and am continually amazed... It's one of the few CDs I own worthy of being called a masterpiece. Everything from Kevin's voice, to his use of sound effects, to his guitars, to his songwriting is perfect. I can't recommend this CD enough..."
2,Not so great,"I return to a really good anthology (Staying Alive) over and over to find favorites and to stumble upon those I've not read yet, and those poems I've forgotten.I haven't picked up this book (Risking Everything) a second time - there's just nothing in it I need to read again. Too bad."
4,I LOVE IT!,"This is a HILARIOUS little book for kids who already know the tired old, tried-and-true routine of A is for alligator, B is for bird, C is for cat, D is for dog. (Actually, in this book B is for a VIKING who also happens to be a beaver, but that's beside the point.)Each letter shows the actual correct animal demonstrating the wrong noun. My favorites have to be ""I can't figure out what Q is for, can you?"" when the picture shows several signs pointing ""Look, it's a quail!"" and ""X and Y are not important letters. Never use them"" with a xylophone and a yo-yo poking out of a garbage truck. Though T is for Polka-dotted Underpants is sure to get a laugh from kids who know not to talk about underpants!I adore this book muchly, and for the younger or more literal children there's a neat appendix explaining what all the letters (excepting X and Y, oddly) REALLY stand for."
2,busy Mom,"I bought the Red White and Blue Permanent Basketball net (2) for our elementary school. The janitor had an extremely difficult time installing them as they are very stiff with a stiff coated wire running through the Hoop and the net. Once installed, the net was very stiff and the kids would get the basketballs stuck in the net. I chose this net as our school is constantly getting our nets stolen or destroyed. But, I think the strength of this net mught be better suited for high school age and up."
2,works but difficult to review footage,"i was able to quickly set up the unit a wireless camera. one note if using motion detection, wireless cameras will inherently produce static glitches every now and then, and cause it to trigger recordings.my issue with this unit was with reviewing the recordings. as others have mentioned the controls are difficult and i could only scroll through about dozen of the latest recorded clips. (you would have to specify a date and time to veiw older recordings). fastest forward scan is about 60x and rewind jumps back alot so it's hard to review the footage. no problem i thought since i can transfer footage via USB and review it on the computer, however watching on their player software isn't any better and the files are propietory format. you can convert it to AVI through the software but in realtime! it plays while it rerecords it to the AVI format.i like to know what has been going on while i was away so the process of reviewing the footage is important to me."
2,A poor man's Malevolent Creation and a bland band with good musicians,"Hate Plow is basically a side project of Phil Fasciana (ex-Malevolent Creation and Rob Barrett (ex-Malevolent Creation, ex-Cannibal Corpse). The singer Kyle Symons even later replaced Brett Hoffmann for two Malevolent Creation albums.As you can already tell, much of this band relies on the existence and notorious instability of Malevolent Creation. Although the charm that makes MC albums worth listening to isn't represented here. Some worthwile humor replaces what this album lacks musically. There is even room for the occasional goofy scripted ""screw up playing"" that made S.O.D. what they were (a la ""What's that Noise?""). The songs blend together after a while and it gives off the impression that the entire album was written and cut in under an hour.If you're a die hard Malevolent Creation or Cannibal Corpse fan and can find this for a couple bucks, you might want to get a couple listens out of it."
2,Only a basic book for database programming,"This truly is only a basic book for the understanding of database programming with vb6. If you want this book to assist you in immediate help in programming vb6 to use databases, then you should look for another one. If you want to use and really become familiar with ADO, then look for another one. It only hits the basics about ADO. It is not for intermediate visual basic progammers, only for the really beginners."
2,Pretty hard reading,"This is a pretty hard book to read, although it explains things in great details at the start, it soon becomes a ""use this for this"" book, it gives you an evaluation copy of SQL Server 7, but it takes SO long to install, let alone uninstall...mind the program is powerful, but it might prove far too unwiedly for people who've only ever used MS Access 97/2000.It explains quite a lot, but later on it hardly explains anything - I'm often asking ""why are we doing this again?"" I often found it hard to do the coding or the instructions, mainly because he doesn't use bullet points - the book is obviousily aimed at people who have mastered ADO, VB, etc.I would not recommend this book to read for ASP/ADO, its better you stick with other books, this won't help you out in VB programming either."
4,I found this book extremely helpful,"Despite what the other reviewers think, i found this book to be extremely focused and valuable. If you are beginner/intermediate VB programmer wanting to learn how to build database applications, this is a great place to start. Provided you want to use ADO (the current technology) and either SQL Server or Access. I learnt a lot, and completed an application i was struggling with confidently and quickly after reading this. Its very practical and very focused. I enjoyed it. It was not difficult to read and I think its a great introduction if you want to actually build an application. I felt like writing to the author to say thanks, but the email bounced!"
1,Don't judge the book by it's cover!!,Don't expect you'll become the master of VB6 database programming by buying this book!!
4,Useful overview of db development,"I would recommend this book to those who want to understand the db development environment without being bogged down in too much detail.However, once you need to get to lower level work for real development this book cannot substitute for more specialised volumes.Overall recommended.dan"
5,"The man seeps with a sad, lost beauty not heard in decades.","Wow. Plain and simple. Whereas many who have fallen under his sad-eyed charm have chosen to tout his 1997 offering ""Other Songs,"" by no means should that sway you from purchasing his eponymous debut. This man's amazingly crafted songs seep with a sorrowful, lost beauty not heard since Elvis Costello crooned Cole's classic, ""Love For Sale."" Costello comparisons are inevitable; Elvis, afterall, is an incredibly vocal fan. But what Sexsmith puts forth on this album has the ability to rival and even supersede some of the spectacled one's most loved early catalog. Full of tracks that bring to mind a lonely afternoon pouring over old photographs and getting lost in forgotten love letters, Ron Sexsmith warrants a listen, if not a permanent space in your collection reserved for all his future efforts."
4,Great discovery,I'm really enjoying this music - this is an early one I believe so some of it's a bit raw but still great.
4,Great Singer Songwriter Talent,"This CD is produced by Mitchell Froom who also produces Suzanne Vega and Los Lobos among others. The production, combined with Sexsmith's incredible songwriting skills, makes for a mesmerizing combination. I've only had the CD a week but have listened to it several times. Check out ""The Words We Never Say"" I like all of the songs except ""Secret Heart"" which is a bit maudlin for my taste."
2,Music for beddy-bye,"I read a review in the Trouser Press guide (I believe) that just went ape over this guy and was curious; I really appreciate good songwriting that deals matters of the heart and mind--Elvis Costello, who can do a ballad just as well as a rocker comes to mind--but Sexsmith is an opposite. His lyrics are very spare; they remind me of the daily horoscope that seems to apply to everyone because the descriptions are so vague. The production of the CD is great, very clean and intimate-sounding, but this is pretty lightweight stuff. The only melody that has stayed with me is ""There's a Rhythm"", and I can't recall one song that breaks what I would call mid-tempo. Lullabys. I fell asleep in front of my CD player while listening to this."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! IT IS OUTDATED!,More than half of the venues listed in this book are no longer in use. They are either gone or have been replaced with new stadiums. This book needs to be updated to reflect all the new stadiums built in the last 6 years since the books printing.
1,WAY OUTDATED!,This book was a huge dissapointment because it is so outdated! I did not pay attention to when it was published or I never would have bought it. My 2 favorite teams The Cleveland Browns and The Columbus Blue Jackets do not even show up in this book.What a huge waste of money!
2,USA Today the Complete 4 Sport Stadium Guide (2nd Ed),"An useful book in 1998, getting bit useless in year 2000. A lot of that has to due to old stadiums long gone and new ones coming on line. A book like this needs to be updated every other year or something. 1996 is simply too outdated to be useful to current travelers. I also wish there were more information on nearby lodging instead of one or two entries and a map on how to get there. For a guide book, its rather limited in scope and information. Still, its the only book of its kind right now so we are stuck with it."
1,This movie is horrible...and it only goes down from there...,"It had a mindless storyline, bad acting, bad lighting, poor directing, poor sound, you can't understand a thing being said. This movie is a complete and total waste of time, money and misplaced misery."
4,An explosive film with great music!!!,Captive is arguably one of the greatest foriegn films I have ever seen. The Edge was outstanding in Capitvating the mood of the movie through the strings of his guitar.
3,"Addicted to that ""Captive"" music","Many years ago as very young boy I had heard that records in a radio and copied it on a CC tape. Then through years I tried to find the CD version. Finaly I have found and felt ones more in love, :-). When you only listen to a music you can image the pictures, but what are the pictures about? The movie Captive I purchased some time ago here at Amazon is a DVD copy version of VHS movie isssued in 1986. So, the pictures are not so important if you realy love that music by the Egde from U2. The story is about a rich girl who lives with her father in a large house. She is kidnapped by three men and subjected to mental and sexual torture in an attempt tto brainwash her. Interested enough?"
1,Unhappy customer,"When I ordered this book the picture was of the latest edition and the condition was said to be good. I received the book and was disappointed to find that the book was in poor condition and the 1976 version. It even had a different cover. Now that I am asked to create a review the picture is of the old version, not the cover I saw when ordering the book. Jen at Woody's Books was very apologetic and even sent me a different book, it was in better condition but still the old version. I give up, I guess I should have paid the $120 for a new book. Shopping for books online is a dissapointment."
1,Piece of Junk,"We bought one for our cold air intake for the VW. It is very fragile and was scraped by an engine cover. As a result, the plastic engine cover sliced the filter. Mind that this is supposed to be a solid product with metal mesh...but the PLASTIC sliced through the ""metal."" In other words, very low quality if plastic can screw up the metal parts of the filter. Had to replace with a better brand of filter."
1,Boring,"The Authority stories are uninteresting and tiresome at best. I guess that the hook for the serious is two openly gay characters. Unfortunately this is not enough to hold the average fan's attention.While the series seems to parody other super hero teams, it does not do so in an entertaining manner. The story plots are simple and repetitive.My advice is to skip this dull series and try something else."
2,Disappointed,Per the reviews I thought that this would be THE WebObjects book to read. I like the high level overview but this book is sooo specific to Project Builder (the IDE) that it is impossible to get any details to what is going on. There is nearly no source code to look at and only pictures that show how to set attributes using the UI. At this point I wish I had bought a different book. :-(
4,Reggaeton leading voice,"I saw Don's video for ""aunque te fuieste"" on H-TV, and I seen him guest on other artists videos so I figured I give his album a try, well it took me a couple months just to find a copy of the album, went to several stores, and none had any in stock. finally I found it at the local air force base bx, I have to say the album is good, if you're having a party you can't go wrong with this album, it doesn't have all the cursing and bad language that some other albums have(not that I mind, but some people do) the album could have had a few different beats, but hey it's reggaton and that's what you get. overall the album is good, Don Omar is one of the best reggaeton artists today"
1,reggaeton=music for the stupid,"I saw J Guerreros review on the front page and I was surprised someone with a brain was actually liking this cd. This is equally as bad as 50 cent, and all the other horrible music out there."
2,Did not receive full order,"I ordered this tea cup. In the picture it includes a saucer. The saucer was not sent to me along with the cup. If you're only selling the cup, don't include the saucer in the photo. I have contacted the seller of this. If they send me the saucer I will happily change my review to a more positive one. If not, I feel this is false advertising."
4,Good case but dimensions given are deceiving,"Bought two of these for carrying lighting equipment for a band. Based on the dimensions given, I believed the equipment intended for these cases would fit perfectly. Well, the measurments are of the outside of the case...not the inside. A good deal with free shipping means I'm keeping them for other things but it won't be for the intended purpose. Even went to the JTT website and could not get any more accurate measurments of the inside. I do recommend the case based on the quality and design but you will need to knock off about 2"" on every dimension to get a good idea of what will fit inside."
3,Just OK for storage,"Normally when in the US I buy wooden Seward trunks from KMart or Walmart but I only managed to find one wooden trunk this trip so had to order this moulded plastic trunk through Amazon in order to take all my holiday purchases home. Although on the whole the trunk is fairly rugged my main gripe is with the flimsy nature of the plastic where the handle connects to the case. Without a suitable padlock to clamp the upper and lower parts of the trunk together, when loaded with 20+kgs the case distorts and gapes open about 1 inch. Left me feeling concerned that at the end of a 10 hour flight my case would arrive broken and battered at the other end due to those delicate baggage handlers. Fortunately it arrived ok but I would not purchase this item again for travel. Its perfectly fine for loft storage though which is what this is now relegated to."
3,Plastic Storage Tool Trunk,"The size of the unit is satifactory, but I feel the strength or thickness of the plastic should be greater. It also should have an easy way to secure to my pickup box, to prevent the whole unit from being stolen."
2,deceiving,Purchased trunk at last minute from Amazon after seeing Walmart merchandise for an oversees trip. It appears somewhat flimsy for the price and the wheels came off after one trip. It's not the cheapest price wise and I would suggest you keep looking if you plan to send this trunk via the mail or airlines...
2,Flimsy construction,Okay for home storage but plastic is flimsy and flexes too easily. I flew with this as checked baggage two days ago and was concerned that it would pop open while being handled. Turns out that wasn't a problem but I was startled to discover when I retrieved it at baggage claim that both wheels had been torn off!
1,Straight crap,Broke right away. Way too expensive for what it was and the thing didn't make it a week. Very angry with the purchase.
3,Did not hold up to luggage handler abuse,The first time the trunk was used was for an overseas trip. The trunk arrived with the top cracked in the two areas around the hasp closures and the metal hinge post bent on one end. I guess I could use duct tape to close it back up but I'll probably just leave it in Iraq and try to find something a bit more heavy duty for the next time I travel.
2,Not Impressed,"The plastic is pretty thin and not at all what you'd consider heavy duty. The rear rod hinge seems flimsy and the trunk locks but you can peel back the corner of the case and reach inside if you're really determined. I would recommend it as a light duty storage container for items that you'll rarely need acess to. Plenty of external handles and it wheels about easily. Not what I'd consider ""contractor grade"" equipment."
1,Flimsy - Poorly Made,"The plastic on this trunk is flimsy and bends easily. When loaded, the weight of items in the trunk is sufficient to flex the plastic and allow the latches to disengage. That's before the cheaply riveted left latch broke on mine. I was definitely disappointed."
1,Awful Product,"Extremely disappointed...the box does hold stuff...that is about it. It is paper thin plastic, not very durable, latches do not line up and hence do not work. I had to repair the cheap hinge right out of the shipping carton. It was not damaged, just poor manufacturing and quality control. Had I seen this product in person before I bought it, I would not have considered it..it is terrible. Contico make a similar container at far less money that is really nice, but does not have wheels. When this piece of crap falls apart (soon, I am sure) I will buy a Contico at Lowes for 2/3 the price.....what a disappointment."
3,okay but,"Trunk has a lot of space but somewhat weak on the sides, fits a lot but not too many heavy items. Lid closes well but again flimsy when open. Overall a good trunk but, I'd rather be old fashioned."
2,Hardware just too flimsy,"The plastic is solid, size is good, and price is right, and if you don't anticipate hauling or shipping this thing much it will get the job done at a good price. But if you intend to check it on an airplane or bus or haul around (we took it on a week-long canoe trip where it was hauled from point-to-point by a luggage service) then it just simply won't stand up to the stress. VERY lightweight closing hardware started to pull away within a few days.Recommended for STORAGE only."
1,Not durable,"I bought two of these some time ago and right out of the box was disappointed. As previously mentioned, dimensions are outside, and the odd insets, reinforcements, and quirky angles greatly reduce the inside storage area. One trip through the Fedex system, and they arrived with huge cracks running through both lids. Save your money and find some real footlockers if your looking for durability and efficient use of space."
4,"Good, light-duty footlocker for the money","For under %40, this footlocker was a good buy. The size inside is ample, and the rolling wheels are ""beefed up"" for durability over rough terrain such as blacktop and gravel driveways. Weaknesses in construction are ""light-duty"" hinges for the lid, and ""light-duty"" plastic construction for the faces of the footlocker.By ""light-duty"" plastic construction, I mean that you would not want to subject the closed footlocker to excess weight (say over thirty pounds). Doing so would bend the shape of the footlocker, possibly even cracking or breaking the plastic sides or lid. Also, the hinge looks like it would snap if the lid were 'flopped-back' quickly or once too-often. This is a lighter-than-average footlocker, and would not be what you would want for shipping overseas, but kept in the bed of your truck for camping purposes, or storing clothing in your attic, it would be ideal. I plan to camp with mine, so I think I made a good purchase!"
3,Keep it Dry!! Keep it Clean!,"My pals and I go on lengthy fishing trips, sometimes into very remote areas. In the past our gear was covered with dust or got soaked. Using this storage box took care of that. And yes, it rained on us last week. And, while everyone was trying to find dry stuff....not me!! Nice and Dry...Nice and Clean!!The only drawback is the hinge system. In time, maybe 4 trips with a little bangin and clangin they will fail or fatigue. I'd like to see a box with a little more sturdy features."
2,These are cheaper in the military.,This product is overpriced and I have found it for half the price I bought two of them brand new for the same price as the one that i bought on here. cheap plastic and very flimsy.
2,Too fragile!,We were so excited - a very reasonable price and other reviews were positive. The plastic is brittle - it broke after being sat upon. These would be perfect for storage; but they aren't up to the task of scout camping.
2,Not Worth The Money,"I work roadshows and needed a hard shipping container to hold my pop up booth so it wouldn't get damaged during shipping. The containers that come with the booth are too big and cumbersome so I wanted one that was easier to handle and cheaper to ship. I bought one at The Container Store that measured 32"" x 18"" x 13"" h but since the handles are formed inside the box, it was just about an inch too short. So I found this box and thought it would be perfect since it was a little longer. The interior is maybe an inch longer but still not enough since I need about another half an inch. This can work for me since I can maneuver the booth to make it work. But the material of this box is not worth the money. This unit is about $10.00 more than the box I bought before but worth about half. If you can get by with a little smaller container, I recommend the storage box at The Container Store.[...]"
2,"In CONUS suitable, OCONUS miserable","I have been using this product for a number of years only for the ease of purchasing it locally. I have had to purchase several of them for trips CONUS to OCONUS and back. All the boxes I have purchased have one problem or another. Some of the issues are: Wheels fall off, handle pops off, latches bend easily and every last one of them is cracked one way or another. Someone needs to come up with a case that has rugged wheels for the bowling ball gardens and moon dust. It should be light tan or olive drab in color and twice as thick plastic to resist cracking or warping, and above all, absolutely affordable for the troops."
1,Doesn't meet airline size for checked baggage - won't stay closed,"This trunk is unsatisfactory for shipping as checked baggage on an airline. First the catches will not keep it closed - I had to use a strap to keep all contents from being dumped everywhere. Second, it's oversize and I had to pay $49 extra (over and above the normal checked bag fee) to have it shipped. It's dimensions are 68.5 inches exceeding the 62 inch limit for checked baggage. I do not recommend this box for shipping on an airline. Definitely an inferior product. I'm sorry I bought the two I did."
1,so disappointing in so many ways,"The storage trunk arrived broken in two places, and after I had opened it to see how bad the damage was, I was unable to latch it securely again without help because the latches were so poorly aligned.Also, the website says ""Ships Separately in Original Packaging"", which I did not understand meant that they slapped a Fed Ex label directly on the storage trunk. The only ""packaging"" aside from the shipping label was a packing slip stuck to the inside of the trunk.I might buy this again, if I could get it locally (so I could visually inspect it prior to purchase) AND at a discount."
2,Camp Mom,"I purchased this trunk to ship my child's clothes to camp. It was roomy enough, but I was disapointed in how it withstood shipping! Although we used the lock-hole, the actual lock was ripped through the hole (so no protection there). The closures were extrememly beat up and bent, but still usable. If you use this to ship via USPS, re-enforce the closures using strapping tape (NOT regular shipping tape!)all the way around both ends of the trunk for extra security. The shape will warp if not secured on both ends, leaving the contents accessible to anyone. I will not buy another trunk of this type."
2,Smaller Than Advertised,"The trunk is lightweight, and sturdy enough, but it is significantly smaller than advertised -- my measurements of this case are: 36"" x 15"" x 12"" as OUTSIDE dimensions; INSIDE is much smaller due to structural ribs -- 31.5"" x 13"" x 12"". Now I'm debating should I order another, using two cases, or send this back for a larger case. Capacity is a critical issue in a case, and the indicated size is a clear misrepresentation."
5,the best i've ever read!,"Five friends and myself have read this book together and we all agree that's it's incredible! I read the entire thing in one day. It was impossible to put down. I've never read an book that has evoked so many emotions in me and enabled me to create such a vivid picture of the characters and everything that happened. I definitely recommend this book to everybody, especially teenagers such as myself. I plan on reading more from this author."
5,Sad story that plays out in the world today.,Do you ever completely know your children and understand what they are capable of doing to themselves and others? The parents appeared to not have a good line of communication with each of the children.
4,Review - The Pact - Jodi Picoult,Very different type of book to what I normally read and it had me in its grip from the beginning to the end!
4,Good,Just what you expect from Jodi Piccoult. A good story and a good read. She writes beautifully. I'd recommend it to a friend.
4,The Pact,"a sad, but well written story of today. I liked the character development and connections of the two families and how their familial connections changed them after tragedy strikes."
3,Average,Remembering how desperate a teenager feels is always important. Picoult emphasized this but I found the book filled with cliches.
5,The Pact......,I'm speechless. This book keep me on the edge of my of seat. I didn't know what to expect to happen next. All the ladies I work with told me to read this book and now I'm passing it on. I can't wait to check out all the other books by Jodi Picoult.
5,Truly Touched,"Jodi Picoult's ability to keep reader's on the edge of their seat left me unable to put this book down! I absolutely loved it!I have never read anything by Picoult until now and I definitely will read more in the future.The Pact was amazing. I could relate to many aspects of the novel and each event left me thinking. The story makes you wonder how life could be so perfect and then change in an instant. Picoult uses great detail in showing the love between two teenagers and how their once close famalies become split apart, left with a mystery of one child dead and the other accused of murder.This book truly touched me and I would strongly reccomend it for readers who enjoy the strength of love and the search for truth."
2,"""A Love Story"" ? Ugh!","Although ""entertaining,"" the storyline was implausible and left too many questions unanswered. The characters were a bunch of the most selfish, self-centered people I've encountered in a novel in a long time. Just what is the author trying to say about love? A book that definitely does NOT leave the reader with any good feelings at all!"
2,"Sorry Jodi, Im not all that impressed",I really expected so much more from this book. I've heard great things about this author but after reading my first by her I must not read anymore. Overall it was so dull and a bit annoying. A few parts made me feel sad but not enough to make me like this book very much. I didn't like the anti abortion message.
1,"Terrible writing, predictible story","I cannot believe that this book has an overall rating of 4.5 stars. If you find yourself enjoying this book, you seriously need to take a creative writing or basic english class.Absolutely horrible writing on par with a high school english class, at best. Very cliche and unsurprising writing style; it seems as if phrases are recycled throughout the book as well. Also very overdramatic and, in no way, is this realistic. Furthermore, there was really no development of the characters.I honestly could not sit through more than 3 pages of this book without having to set it down and take a break. I WANT to like this book, but I can't.Perhaps one of the most poorly written books that I have read in the last 5 years."
1,I read it twice,I read this book twice just to make sure i didn't miss anything the first time. It kept me coming back to see what the characters would do next!
3,Just ok,After reading 19minutes I couldn't wait to read more from Jodi pickling. This book was neither great or disappointing it was just plain predictable from cover to cover. It got me through a l.power outage after a heavy New England snow storm that was for me the best part about it unfortunately
4,The Pact,Typical Picoult story with twists and turns that keep you engaged. Ending not as totally expected. Great characters as always.
4,Great Read!,I love this novel by Jodi Picoult. It's an emotional and intriguing story of the lives of two very close families. I read this book in 3 days. It was so hard to put down. I'd recommend it!
4,I couldn't put it down....,"Jodi Picoult does an awesome job with this book. I absolutely loved the book. However, I gave it 4 stars because the ending was somewhat confusing to me....I didn't really enjoy how the book was ended.I would still recommend it!!!"
5,Wow! Felt so real.,I just finished reading this book. Amazing! I was in tears before I finished and had to keep reminding myself it was a book. The characters felt so real to me. I wanted to reach out and help them. Help them overcome their problems and go on with their lives. Picoult is an amazing author. I can't wait to read more of her books.
4,"Amazing, hurtful and angry",I read this just after my stepfather passed away. I was in such pain with Chris for loosing someone he loved and willing to take whatever they dish out to him. I had a hard time putting the book down.
2,I LOVE J Picoult's works -- EXCEPT this one!,"What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards."
2,Just Not My Cup of Tea,"I can see by the reviews on these pages that there are a lot of people who loved The Pact. I am not one of them. While the story may have had some potential, Picoult doesn't develop anything. There is nothing special about this novel at all, it's just a run-of-the-mill story. No humor, no character development, no believable characters, no thought-provoking observations, nothing to distinguish it as anything but a quick read. She skims the surface, gives us predictable and somewhat boring and indistinguishable characters. As a quick read, it's not awful, but that's about the best I can say."
2,Very shallow,"Because this book is so 'readable', people are claiming it's art. But try and look a little below the surface (and this book is all surface) and see that it's really unbelievable and very shallow. The characters are so thinly drawn, that they have only one characteristic each (Gus is forthright, James is reserved. And what about Kate? Was she anything more than a plot device that popped in and out as needed to forward the story?) The telling monents, such as Emily grabbing Chris's hand immediately after she is born is so contrived it's cringe-inducing.I know a lot of pople will tell me I'm heartless for not being affected by this story. But when something is this blatantly manipulative without offering any genuine insight, I can't fall for it. But obviously, there are plenty of people who like to be emotionally manipulated.Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it well written? Absolutely not."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ,This is the first book by Jodi Picoult I read and I will definitely read all of her books. This book is incredible. There was not one wasted word in the entire book. I cried at the end.
2,Very Disappointed,I believe I read Jodi Piccoult's best book first and that was My Sister's Keeper. The Pact was very disappointing. The book tells us that the girl was depressed and possibly abused. The mother finds and burns the girl's diary yet they never reveal to the reader what was in the diary or what was tormenting the girl. I was very disappointed that more was not revealed about the reason why the girl was so depressed.
5,Gripping!,"Compelling from start to finish, this was a book I could not put down. The story was intriguing and the characters were well developed and realistic, even lesser characters like the defense attorney and his son. Descriptions were so vivid that I could easily picture the scenes in my mind. I especially enjoyed the trial which was convincingly authentic to me. Although I did wonder why some characters said certain things or made certain choices, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story."
4,hard to put down!,"This was the first Jodi Picoult book that I had read and I was overall very pleased. It is the type of book, that is extemely hard to put down. The book's set up makes the reader feel as if he or she is a detective, trying to gather clues to figure out the case. The characters in the book are the type people, one would run into on a daily basis, making the book easy to relate to. Although, I did enjoy reading the book, I was extremely dissappointed by the ending. I felt as though Picoult left the reader hanging with more questions and I wanted more answers. Overall, I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a book that keeps one's attention, and likes the aspect of trying to figure out a crime."
5,The Pact A Love Story,"All I can say is that this book is easily one of the best that I have ever read its got everything love,mystery,hate,truth,blame and it definatly has its share of twists and turns so buy it read it and keep reading it because this book will become part of your soul and stay with you forever Jodi Picoult has a gift when it comes to looking into the souls of her charectors so read get lost in the world of Chris and Emily and let this book become a part of you"
2,The Pact.,I didn't like this book as it was too sad. I think it was well written and most of what happened could really happen in real life. It was so well written I felt it was a real life story.
5,A great read as always,"Jodi picoults novel is nothing short of what we have come to expect from a woman who can take the topics that weigh heavily on the hearts of strangers and examine it from all angles, leaving the reader breathless with the knowledge we may have otherwise missed and walking away from this book with a new insight into the world we hear just briefly touched upon on the evening news. Truly worth every second and every penny."
4,Captured my attention,I like it when a book leaves you wondering until the end. I also like to skip back and forth from the past to the present.
4,The Pact,Was quite good. Would gladly recommend it for most people.Nothing more to add to this and I feel silly.
3,Disappointing,The story dragged and did not hold my attention. it started off with promise but got bogged down. I understand it is about the relationships of the people and how they changed and little they really knew each other but that was not a strong enough storyline to be satisfying.
2,Book,"OK nothing to ""write home about"" very predictable writing and did not much for me. I know this author is very popular but it is too preachy in some ways and one can see the end miles and pages away."
3,The Pact,A bit depressing. Well written. Keeps you wondering where the author is going with this story. Character relationships are well developed .
4,Emotional reading on teen suicide,"The plot kept me going, although it was a challenging read. It was a believable story about young love and the crazy way that teens think about life and death."
3,Only OK,Premise is interesting but characters are one dimensional. Relationships are superfical and even sometimes cartoonish. I finished it because I WAS interested enough to find out what happens in the end..........but that was a disappointment too.
3,Not her finest,"I love Jodi's books. She has a penchant for picking a very controversial topic, exploring it from several different viewpoints through her characters, and oh that unexpected twist ending! Of all her novels (I think I have read maybe six) this was by far my least favorite. Maybe it was the general theme, the fact that the characters just seemed to be either overly angry or horny all the time, or this plot a little underdeveloped. Usually I can't put her guilty pleasure books down, but this was a bit of s struggle to get through. Just my two cents. I far prefer ""My sister's keeper"" and ""Plain truth."""
5,Is it possible to be in love with a book?,"This was the first novel that I read by Ms. Picoult. I do not normally read novels in her genre but my mother gave it to me and one night, when I had virtually dug through my bookshelf for something to read and came up with nothing, I took ""The Pact"" out and began to read. I was INSTANTLY trapped within its pages. I have never cried, laughed, or felt when reading a book as much as I had with this one. Since my first time reading it, I have recommended it to numerous friends and I even wrote the Oprah Winfrey show in hopes of having her put it on her book-of-the month club.And now I recommend it to all of you who are reading this review. A cautionary note: This book will swaddle you in a blanket of emotions and trap you with its words. It is nearly impossible to put this book down without finishing it. Make sure that you have plenty of quiet solitude to enjoy this masterpiece and make sure to bring plenty of tissues."
1,Don't buy the hype!,"Shallow shallow shallow! This is the kind of book that seems to have been written with either the movie deal or Oprah's book club in mind. The NY Times review is right: the characters are one-dimensional, the plot predictable. If you have ever read one legal thriller, or have even a high school education, you can easily figure out what ""plot twist"" or ""emotional turmoil"" will come next. What's worse, the paperback version of the book comes with discussion points, as if the themes of incest, social class, career, and showing of emotions were not obvious enough. This book is truly an example of the dumbing down of America."
1,I do not recommend it,"I have to say that I did enjoy reading it but it is the ending that vexed me. You are waiting for this mistery to be solved and when you get to the end you are terribly disappointed. Throughout it is a good read, kind of a trial novel like one of John Grisham, but it all looses any sense when you finish it."
5,A love tragedy..............,"""The Pact"" was an astonishing novel of two soul mates, Chris and Emily. They knew each other since the day they were born and grew up to love one another more than anything in the world. Unfortunately, Emily discovered she was pregnant and couldn't face becoming a dissapointment to the rest of the world. Her only way out was suicide, and because Chris would do anything to make her happy, he helped her kill herself. This book was one of the best I have ever read; it was impossible to put down. Every customer seems to love the twisted psychological tale, and important lessons can be learned about the consequences of actions and about living life to its fullest. ""The Pact"" recieves my highest praise."
4,Could Not Put It Down,"The Pact is by far my favorite Picoult. The story is so moving - leaving you so much to think about, almost like you are solving a mystery - a courtroom mystery. This very adult novel brings back teen memories about the power of love along with the heartbreaks of being a parent. I could not put it down. A good friend and I loved this book so much and had so many discussions about it that we decided to start a book club."
4,Another good Picoult novel!!!,"I just finished reading The Pact today (my 3rd Picoult read) and all in all I was happy with the novel. First off, I was thrilled that it had a happier ending compared to Picoult's normally tragic endings that leave you balling your eyes out. I think the sad part of this story is the fact that love and friendship is torn apart by this horrific event. I found myself sympathizing the most for Chris Harte and Gus Harte (Chris's mom). Although I felt there should have been a little more information that could have surfaced reguarding Emily's true feelings of wanting to die, I felt the book told a compelling story. The court scenes are amazing. I found myself rooting for Jordan McAfee the whole time. I love Picoult's books but I honestly can't read them one after another because I can't deal with all that sadness that occurs in her stories. However, this book was refreshing."
4,Keeps your interest............,"The Pact kept me reading because I needed to know what happens to Chris. Many times I wondered WHY aren't they asking the right questions to get the needed answers. Like many other readers I thought there was going to be some earth shattering twist at the end but was disappointed it never happened. All in all - it was a suspenseful book that kept my interest and had an ""appropriate ending""."
3,The Pact: A Love Story . . . my review,"If you are looking for a happy ending; don't buy this book. It was a pretty dark story, but the author keeps things moving and interesting throughout the novel."
5,Great book!,"Great book, a must read. This could be anyone of our family's or friends. Learn the warning signs for suicide. You could save a life!"
3,Interesting,"...but not quite plausible in parts. Somehow the insights came too simply after Emily's death. I will say that the book is a good read. (But what's with the repeated ""steepling"" of fingers? And that descriptor, new to me, is also in Kristin Hannah's work. I found it interesting the first time only.)"
4,"Oy, what a book","This book was good, but a little tedious to read. I kept silently screaming, ""Tell us what really happened already!!!!!!!"""
4,Engrossing book that I didn't want to put down!,"This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. It went back and forth from present to past time and made me want to keep reading to find out what happened. It was pretty sad, but a good read!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of Jodi Picoult but I found this to be the weakest of her novels.Perhaps she intended to leave us with many unanswered questions, but I found it to be a very unsatisfying read. Her characters and their motivations were not well developed. I didn't really understand any of them."
3,When Close is too Close,"An interesting study of the problems that can arise from a lack of personal boundaries and the long standing expectations that we place on ourselves and the people in our lives. Predictable and angst filled, the book was adequately compelling to hold my attention. Picoult's insight into the human condition is good even with the details of the telling are lacking."
5,Gripping. Engrossing. Disturbing.,"I finished this book in about 24 hours. When I wasn't able to read it, I was thinking about how much I wanted to finish it. The characters are so real, the emotions so raw... I felt a connection to each of the characters on some level. This was so well written that I found myself crying several times throughout the book. Because each of the characters is so well developed, I think this is a book anyone could enjoy; there is at least one character that everyone can relate to. This novel is a true page turner, and it definitely stays with you. I am very excited about seeing this in movie format."
5,I must read more of Jodi Picoult books!,"I am an avid reader & love sampling various authors. Because of the reasonable price on this book, I sampled it & just finished reading it. WOW!! I rarely read a book that I just simply cannot put down. Sleep usually gets to me first. But I really could not sleep until I finished this powerful book. I was up VERY late last nite & it was worth it. A geat love story but so much more. A great psychological thriller as well. The issues were deep & powerful & I will now search for more stories by Jodi Picoult. Thanks Amazon!!"
5,The Pact,I love the Jodi Picoult books. This was very good. Sad ending.I will share with my Kindle Fire sharing friends/sister.
4,A Difficult Topic!,"But as usual, Ms. Picoult touches theheart of readers with her real life crisessituations and wrenches your emotions."
4,A Sad Tale,"Written with compassion, but left one feeling the issues hadn't been fully resolved. Was this a court drama or an examination of teenage emotions in an adult world? Overall a bit inconclusive, but nevertheless thought provoking and certainly enough character development to allow the reader to identify."
5,The Pact,It was difficult to put down. Kept me guessing until the end. Highly recommended to any parent of a teenager.
4,Liked,I am a fan of Jodi Picoult and was again not disappointed in her books. Would recommend for others to read.
5,On reading this for the 2nd time - I still found it captivating. The depths of teenage angst will awlays remain a closed book.,"The plot is well laid out, keeping you guessing. The characters are all accessible and easy to empathise with. Suicide is still a very taboo topic even in this 21st century and we do not know and never will know why suicides happen in 90% of cases. Something is lacking in society - I cannot put it into concise words, but not only with teens, but with anyone - the ""need""to end ones life can trul;y appear to be the only solution and we, society must when in doubt, actively invade people's hearts and minds to check whether they are truly ok. Jodi Picoult is a true story teller with a message(s) in every novel."
4,Easy read,"I enjoyed the book. It was a quick easy read. No real surprises, however. I would recommend this for teenagers."
5,The Pact,This is my fifth Jodi Picoult and it generally follows a script she has developed such as there is usually a legal wrangling of some sort. I have learned somethings from her five books that makes them enjoyable to read. My goal is to read all of her books because I do enjoy her writing style. Ms Picoult's writing is intelligent with a current feel to it. I recommend reading The Pact..it is fun to get into the heads of her characters without investing too much in them. Good modern day writing.
3,Good but not great!,"It was nothing too special. I found it to be fairly predictable. Worth reading, but don't think your getting a page turner."
2,Not For The Serious Reader,"The Pact resembles nothing so much as a puchero, the Spanish stew made of leftovers and highly spiced in an attempt to marry and mask the component ingredients. Picoult pulled stock characters out of her refrigerator--gorgeous weepy teens and upset mothers (one capable, one dizzy)--and put them into the old cast iron love story. She then spiced it up with a suicide pact and attempts to serve it in the context of a criminal prosecution.Completely missing are (1) character development; (2) acute observations of love, loss and commitment; and (3) cleverness.By the way, doesn't New Hampsire penal law embrace lesser included offenses? Someone needs to do a little homework. But not me, I am busy reading more serious stuff."
1,Depressing!!!!,"Her books are not for those struggling with their own depression...if anything, they'll push vulnerable folks over the edge!"
5,Exceptional Book !,"This is an exceptional book! I just could not put it down. The picture Picoult paints of Chris and Emily is so vivid that you feel you are part of the book. I was almost sad as I was nearing the last pages of the book since I felt so connected to the story and the characters. Her writing does an excellent job develping all the characters and the storylines. It shows all aspects of relationships - friends, lovers, siblings, family, collegues and the emotions one goes through - love, pain, completeness, exhilaration, confusion, anger, guilt, shame, persistence.... I have not read a book this good in a LONG time."
3,"Not my favorite book of hers, but solid","I've read a number of Jodi Picoult's novels, and I enjoy them immensely. That said, this isn't the strongest one. I was surprised that it came out in 2006, since the book is set in the mid-to-late '90s. All of the character are very East Coast: cold, withholding, more concerned about appearances than anyone's well-being. Hard to really empathize with any of them, other than maybe the boy's mom and the girl's dad. As always, the court scenes are very engaging - I finished the second half of this book in one long reading session.I read the Kindle edition, which is $3. It was fine. If you like her books, this won't be your favorite, but it's a decent read."
3,Love sucks,"This has been done before and I'm not a fan of it. I mean the whole Romeo and Juliet ""we're so hopelessly in love let's just kill each other bc we can't live without each other"" is gross and unoriginal."
4,Grab the tissues,"This book is an easy read and kept my attention. If you're a soft hearted sap like myself, be ready to create some puddles of tears."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a real page turner but had a very disappointing ending. I felt that Miss Picoult could have done so much more with this story. It had the potential for so many twists. I was beginning to think that Chris and Em were brother and sister since it seemed as though Michael Gould and Gus might have been close in the past since they seemed drawn together by this trial and Michael said that he was testifying for Chris. And, that maybe Em found out and it may have devasted her more to be pregnant by her own brother! But it turned out there were no twists and the ending was totally boring. This is my second novel by this author and I won't be reading any more."
2,"A fast read, but not believable","This book entertained me - I won't lie. I read through it quickly and wanted to find out what happened in the end. But then, I was thoroughly disappointed. Without spoiling the ending for others, the book is completely implausable. Chris' explanation of what happened the night his girlfriend died is absolutely ridiculous. Further, the jury's finding, at the end of the case, is highly unlikely.This is the second Jodi Piccault book I have read - I read Vanishing Acts too - and I preferred Vanishing Acts because at least, the story was logical. I don't think I would pick up another Jodi Piccoult book, however, because she isn't a great writer."
3,Not this one,"Picoult is a great writer, but sometimes her plot devices simply don't work. This effort was one of those times."
2,Total disappointment at end!!,"I expected something more at the end of book when we ""found out"" what really happened, it just seemed so.... so, I don't know even know what but just not what I expected. On a separate note, it was a bit bothersome to have the author use the Lord's name in vain sooooooooooooooo many times and often with laced with profanity. I think she should perhaps be a little more thoughtful to people of the Christian faith and how over the top her use of it was. Maybe next time she use a profanity using buddha, confuscious, etc., etc., Just saying."
3,A good read but...,"After being turned on to Jodi Picoult through My Sister's Keeper, I sought her out at the bookstore and stumbled upon this book.Picoult manages to capture the essence of the grief and heartache suicide bequeathes in exacting detail. I admired the deft way in which she segued from present to past, seamlessly telling the story of a multitude of characters through varying perspectives.However, I think she fell short in the execution of events leading to Emily's suicide. After the last page, I'm still left questioning how Emily was brought to believe suicide was her only option. I think Picoult should have examined this angle a bit more in-depth."
5,4.5 stars,"this is a beautifully written novel and i reccomend it to everyone. i just have a few complaints ::1. i wish she would have talked more about the past2. some chapters taking place in present time seemed to drag oni cried often during the story.. its very emotional.. but its great. if you're a girl, i bet you will like it !"
5,Could not put the book down. Read it in two days.,Jodi Picoult develops the characters so well that the reader becomes totally involved with the intriging story. You are curious about the characters; you cannot wait to discover the truth; the characters are on your mind when you have to put the book down. You will never forget them.
2,I usually love Jodi Picoult but.....,"I can honestly say that there aren't a whole lot of books I have read that I didn't like, but I did not like this book. I thought it was hard to get into it at first and when I finally did, I was just wanting the get through the book to be done with it. I usually really love Jodi Picoult's characters but in this book I didn't make that connection. To me it just seemed kind of boring. Even after I finished the book I wasn't exactly sure why she felt like her only option was suicide. My recommendation is to skip this book and read some of the other Jodi Picoult books instead!"
1,mining other people's misery,This seems to be a fictionalized telling of a murder that happened in Maryland 20 some years ago. We know Jodi Picoult can write - but she's weak in plot (My Sister's Keeper - the ending? The lawyer who has a grand mal seizure and is driving a sports car a couple hours later?) but it is rather soulless and completely parasitic to take the killing of a real live person and make a boo hoo novel out of it - even if we are 20 years later.
1,Impressed,I COMPLETELY ENJOYED THIS BOOK! This story has it all. I could not put it down. I will be recommending it!
3,Teenage Suicide,"The topic of this book is teenage suicide, so it is not a warm and fuzzy novel. I love reading Jodi Picoult, but this was not one of her best works. I understood the loneliness of the heroine in the novel, but I could not understand why she felt suicide was the only way. This story felt incomplete somehow, like there was something Mrs. Picoult was leaving out. By the end of the book, even the romance felt tainted. The surprise at the end of the novel was that there is no surprise, no explanation, no satisfaction. Just an ok read for me."
3,Teen Suicide,"I am not going to ruin the story or the ending for you in case you decide to read this book. It was an interesting book about teen suicide, but I did not enjoy reading it. I kept reading it to the end in order to find out what happened. It is well written, but in a way it is almost painful to read. I thought the end was a total fantasy and never would have happened. If you would like to try and get into the minds of two teenagers and a world view that leads to disaster, by all means read the book. This book got lots of fabulous reviews, but I don't agree on this one. If I had really known what the book was like, I would not have read it."
2,displeased,"There were times when I could not put this book down....and then @ other times, I did not care if I ever picked it up again. The end was very weak. Does anyone know why Emily killed herself??...."
4,I loved this book,"This book is completely engrossing. I could not put it down. The characters seemed very real, and the love between Chris and Emily is haunting."
2,A good plot but a bit of a drag,"The Pact by Jodi Picolt was lent to me by a friend who absolutely loved it. I started reading it on a weekend, and have to admit that the story line was interesting. The characters grabbed my attention, but there was a certain redundancy in the narrative style. I like the plot to move on and have threilling inexpected turns. The autor tried to create suspense in her own style and used some psychological metaphor which was a good attempt. I was not happy with the climacx, I think it could have been handled with more finesse. Editing the book down to about 350 pages and especially making the ending more dynamic could have strengthened the storyline. I would recommend it but with a word of caution, I had to skim through several page."
5,The Pact,"As a high school teacher, I thought this book might be interesting. Instead of just a teenagers' novel, I found a book I couldn't put down! The characters are believable, the story line riveting, and the ending a shock. As an adult, you will be reminded of your childhood and teenage years. As a teenager, you can get a feeling of what it might be like to be the living member of a suicide pact. A must read for teenagers, teachers, and parents of teenagers"
2,Painfully slow,"The plot had such potential then offered very little. To many characters undeveloped I like to know my characters feel thier pain,happiness ect. I was not able to connect. The ending was also a source of great disappointment Too bad."
2,thought I would never get through this book.,"This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and may be my last. I felt like I was climbing up a steep hill, never to reach the top. The book starts out with a murder ?, suicide ?, and goes downhill from there. Tedious trial, and many unanswered questions. Why was this teenage girl so miserable and unhappy? Some hints of abuse, but nothing is clear or validated. Her parents were clueless. Depressing story, with really no answers, not a romantic love story."
2,Disappointing! Not up to Picoult's standards,"What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards."
2,"Not bad, but not realistic....","First of all, I love Jodi Picoult. I think she handles difficult subjects well and is very good at conveying despair and disbelief. But she has already written a similar story (Mercy)about sucide and while I bought the ending in Mercy due to the small town atmosphere and very clear facts I flat out refuse to believe the ending in this book as remotely realistic. This ruined the book for me. I have a degree in Criminal Justice, but even if I didn't, anyone who watches Law and Order knows that the circumstances in this book are pretty clear cut legally. Sad, but clear cut. I know that Ms. Picoult is a good author and not afraid of difficult endings,(My Sister's Keeper). Why take the easy way out with this book when she could have produced a thoughtful, if painful narrative of how the real world sometimes works?"
3,The Pact,This was an O.K. book but got boring at certain parts. Still unsure who pulled the trigger. Wanted Emily's Mother to admit to what she did with the diary.
4,Jodi Picoult's books,I have read quite a few of Jodi's books and I like them all. They keep me interested enough to not want to put the books down.
4,Book well written,"Awesome story line, easy to read, kept you guessing, will read other Jodi Picoult books in future. Great characters too."
5,Loss for words,"I couldn't put the book down. I felt as if I were apart of the love story, I could feel the pain they felt as easily as the love they had for one another."
4,The pact,A thrilling read although the court scene was very similar to another one of her books (plain truth) however I enjoyed it
5,Jodi strikes again,Jodi Picoult can always be counted on for a good read. The dynamics between families and the young lovers is a believable study in human nature. The development of the character's and their decisions leaves you page turning to the end. Very good book.
2,Does not ring true,It seemed very contrived. The reason for the suicide was very unbelievable and none of the character seemed real. I would not recommend this book.
4,The Pact,"Love everything Jodi writes....what a twist! She makes one think about ""what if's"" that you'd never come up with. Keeps you page turning to find out what on earth could happen next!"
3,The Pact,"This offering by one of my favotite novelists was slow to begin. It just never grabbef my interest as her other works have. The Pact cerrtainly was not ""bad"" just an average novel,not what I was eagerly expecting."
4,The Pact - Picoults Brightest,This book is one of Picoults best. The descriptions of the moments that caused Emily and Chris to fall in love are riveting and beautiful. The events to describe their childhood paints a picture of the trial Chris is faced with. This book will remain one of my favorites.
3,A page-turner in spite of itself,"This was my first Jodi Picoult novel. It was recommended to me by my stepmother, who absolutely loved it. I was disappointed with the book inititally because the writing style is not as sophisticated as I had hoped it would be; but in spite of this, I got caught up in the plot and had trouble putting it down. I finished the book in about a day or so, but instead of feeling a sense of closure and fulfillment upon its completion, I felt vaguely annoyed. I immediately began thinking about what was WRONG with the book: Emily's unconvincing motivation for suicide, Chris' ludicrous decision NOT to act on his girlfriend's behalf, the quick and easy ending. Still, I did enjoy the experience of reading this, in spite of its flaws. I don't know that I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys more literary fiction, but it is an easy read for a boring day."
4,A Good Read,"This is a book that I would recommend. While there were things that I wish the author would have elaborated on more and not let hanging, all in all, this book was worth reading. Even if it ends up not being a favorite of yours, don't stop yourself from reading more of Jodi Picoults work. This the 3rd book I've read of hers and I've not been disappointed yet."
5,this book is a great read!,"This book was a great read.. its the kind of story that once you finish it you find your self thinking about it and the characters, whose pain and emotions you felt so vividly. i loved this book and i recomend it to anyone who loves a story that takes you deep into the characters mind."
5,The Pact,This was such a beautifully written masterpiece!! It was very difficult to set down. This is a love story that everyone should read. It's utterly heart-wrenching!
3,Good But Missed The Mark For Me,"I enjoyed this book for the most part, but it left me feeling like there was more to the story that was not told. The idea that 2 families could be so close and then be so suddenly torn apart seemed unbelievable to me. I also wished there were more details regarding Emily's storyline because I found it hard to understand why she was suicidal. The story was a good idea, it just fell a little short for me to rate it any higher."
3,The Pact,"The Pact contained a story line previlant in today's society. Scary but true. The story kept you interested trying to predict the outcome. It was very fast reading, it was hard to put down. I've since read several of the author's books and found them to be of interest."
4,Excellent for leisurely reading!,"I read Jodi Picoult's ""The Pact"" only a couple of months ago, and I must say that it is my favorite of the most current literature out there. I loved the story line because I could vividly see the entire plot being played out in my mind. While I do not think it is destined to be a classic, I do think it is a good book worth reading."
4,Excellent but depressing!,This book is very well written. It's a gripping and realistic story about 2 teens and their apparent suicide pact. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an intense and enjoyable (but not uplifting!) read.
4,Page-turning,"Couldn't put it down - the intertwining of a ""murder-mystery"" with a psychological, romantic drama - brilliant. Loved the uncertainty that was constantly put into the story making you want to keep reading to find out what truly happened. Great book."
2,Didn't like this one,I didn't like how Emily was closed off to Chris even though she loved him very much. She should have let Chris know what happened to her in the Men's bathroom at least when they became a couple. He would have been more understanding towards her when it came to the way she felt about sex. I thought she was extremely selfish for not thinking of what would happen to Chris once she was gone. The fact that she was so closed off and very selfish made me not like this book.
4,Very good read,"This author is always interesting, and here she digs a little deeper into her characters to come up with a more oomplex look at life. The writing flows beautifully as ever and her insights are peppered throughout. The story caught and held my attention, and this is why I continue to look forward to her next one."
5,WOW!!,"All I have to say, is this book will stick with me for life!! I read it and couldn't put it down till i was finished!! WOW!!!"
3,Eh,So far so good. Haven't quite gotten into it hopefully it will pick up pace and carry on no snoozer
2,OK,"I like this author but then I don't. Is she being controversial just to say she was? I want to love the books I have read of hers but they piss me off too much. Besides this, I have read My Sister's Keeper and The Plain Truth. I enjoyed parts of all 3, but for the most part I was just mad."
2,ripped is not like new,"The book was sold like new but when I received it it was ripped and pages were crumbled. Did it take from the book- no but really do not say ""like new"" if it is ""like ripped"""
5,The Pact,Wow. What a fantastic writer. Holds you attention from the very first paragraph. Excellent write.
2,riveting but painful,"I sobbed my way thru this book, unable to put it down yet feeling so miserable I wished I could. It's very well crafted, yet I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for emotional pain."
5,WOW. An absolute WOW.,"I am only halfway through the book, but since last night I have not been able to put it down. What an amazing and creative way to bring this story to life. Not only do I love the story, I love Jodi's style. WONDERFUL READ."
2,Disappointment.,"I am typically a fan of Picoult but this book was missing something. I had trouble caring about the characters and I just felt creeped out the entire book, the closeness of the two families and the dating of the kids felt almost incestuous. I did not like this book and was really disappointed; I would recommend Vanishing Acts or Salem Falls instead."
2,Incredibly disappointing!,"This is the second novel I have read by this author and I have come to the conclusion that she has a problem with endings. She starts out great and the stories are interesting and she is taking on tough issues but then she wimps out. The first one of hers I read was My Sister's Keeper. Like this one, I picked it up because the synopsis sounded intriguing and like this one I was disappointed because she doesn't handle the very issue she's writing about. In The Pact even she admits (in an interview) she let Chris off and the ending wasn't right. Then why write it? Her endings are emotional cheats. If you don't really want to face an issue don't write about it."
5,The Pact by Jodi Picoult,"This book was so good I couldn't put it down. There is something for everyone to learn from it....parents, lovers, teenagers, etc. A worthwhile read."
3,Review of The pact,I chose this selection because I enjoy writings by this author. Jodi Picoult holds a reader by not revealing valuable info about the plot until near the end of the book. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this author.
5,Loved loved loved this book,"When my best friend recommended this book i was hesitant at first, but after the first chapter I was hooked. This book is wonderfully written. I absolutely couldn't put it down!"
5,Wonderful,"Wonderful book, drew you in and held you till the end. I would recommend this book to everyone to read."
5,Intriguing,"This book is a definite page turner. Very good book, I would love to see this made into a movie!"
2,Disappointing,"I have read almost every Jodi Picoulet book and this was the first one that I didn't enjoy. Without spoiling the story for others, I'll just say that to me the whole thing just seemed unbelievable. Very disappointing!"
4,"Yet Another, Good, Thought-Provoking Work by Jodi","Following her traditional multi-perspective style, this is a very good book...but, I'd put it in the middle of her collection. It deals with teen suicide, teen incarceration, the impact of strained family relationships, and courtroom strategies...all of which she turns into compelling reading."
4,Worth reading,"For a brief moment, I missed being a teenager in love. What a sad and tragic book. It brought back a lot of adolescent memories. The twists in this book make it worth the read."
5,WOW I love this book!,"From the moment I picked it up, I couldn't put this book down. It was great. I swear, I had never read a book that got to me like this book did. I read another book by Picoult before, and I love how she writes. This is the only book ever that has made me actually cry. The Lifetime Channel made a movie of it but it was nowhere near as good as the book. I think it was very real. The way the character's feelings are described were just very real. I loved the description she uses. I know I will definitely be reading this book again! I definitely recommend it."
5,Loved it,I usually can't stomach these types of subject matters but this book was great. I wasn't able to predict every twist and turn. don't want to give away anything so I'll just say there were lots of unanswered question at the end so I hope there will be a part 2.
4,Worth the read,"I'm a huge Jodi Picoult fan, and although I really enjoyed this book, it left me with many unanswered questions. I can appreciate leaving some things up to the reader's imagination, but this just left me frustrated. Melanie's actions literally angered me at times. Nevertheless, this book took me on an emotional roller coaster, and I'm glad I read it despite wanting just a little bit more. Heart-wrenching subject matter."
3,"A perfect ""made for TV movie""...","A very quick, easy read. The characters are fairly one-dimensional and some of the descriptions and overly obvious ""fore-shadowing"" made me want to gag. However, I kept with it out of a desire to know what ""really"" happened. It would make a great, slightly cheesy, TV movie."
2,A Book Packed With Strange Information,"I was introduced to this book by a good friend who raved about it and convinced me to read it myself. So I guess when I got it I was expecting this great novel, but half way through it, I couldn't read any more. Picoult doesn't portray teenage lives very realistically. She describes Emily's sink towards depression, but she doesn't develop why this occurs. She presents Emily's thoughts well, but gives no back-up for them. You don't feel like you ""know"" Emily because the author doesn't go deep into her charachter development. I feel that the story moved fast, but the plot didn't move at all. Years went by, and there was little or no advancement in the plot. The book wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
3,Ending left me with questions,"This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I am not rushing out to get the next one. It was a very quick read, but left me with many unanswered questions. Why didn't Chris ever ask why Emily was suicidal? Why didn't Em feel she had any other options? Why didn't Chris turn to other sources to solve her problem? It was if all the characters just gave up too easily which makes me as the reader not care very much about their struggle."
3,cheesy ending,"Overall, the book held my attention, but I was disappointed with the ending. (I was disappointed with the ending of My Sister's Keeper also.) Jodi Picoult's books seem to capture my interest in the beginning, but the conclusions aren't very well developed or realistic."
2,Depressing Story,"They were meant to be together forever...or were they? Emily Gold and Chris Harte grew up hand in hand. Their families were best friends and neighbors. They grew together like twins...brother and sister. They became lovers, and wanted things to stay the same forever. But the only thing constant about life is change. Emily felt that there was only one way to accomplish keeping things the same. She dies with Chris. Now he is charged with murder. But was it murder? Was it suicide? Was it from love? Was it from secrets? Was it a pact?I felt this book was written well. I enjoyed the novel but feel indifferently as to how the story ended. If you enjoy books that are depressing and leave you with questions, I feel you would like The Pact."
2,Another Formulaic Picoult Novel,"Overall, I have to give this book 2 stars. In the scheme of all books, it's a sold 2 star book. For what it is, it is much higher.What it is: a Jodi Picoult novel that deals with an emotionally supercharged situation and progresses through a trial. The truth of what actually happened is revealed in the last 5% of the book. The writing is solid, the characters are heartfelt, and the conclusion is what you expect.What's different about this novel, and what was frankly distracting was the sexual situations. Too many. I read enough ""he entered her"" sentences to last me a lifetime. Gave the book kind of an ick factor.If you're a Jodi Picoult fan, this is a book for you."
2,Disappointed,"I found Chris and Emily's relationship chiche, and unrealistic. Some of the descriptions literally made me cringe at how sickeningly sweet Picoault tried to make their relationship seem. The ending was a let down, and seemed rushed. Too many loose ends with no explaination. However, what annoyed me most was the repetition of phrases (""She snorted"".), as well as some inconsistencies which should have been caught by an editor. I didn't hate it, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it. I liked this the least of all her books I have read."
4,Very good!,"I always enjoy reading Jodi Picoult's books, especially this one. It seems as if each one of her books somehow hits close to home. I could hardly put this book down and I would (and do) recommend this book to avid readers."
2,The Pact,I LOVE JODI PICOULT!!! With that said I have to say that The Pact was not one of her better books that she has written. I think that the book went a slow and I was finding it VERY hard to get through. I would not recommend you read this book and try one of her other ones.
2,Just ok,"Well....I have read other Jodi Picoult books and absolutely loved them. I really wanted to feel that way about The Pact. I became very involved in the book but felt as if the end fell short. I kept waiting for a great, heart wrenching, climactic ending. Instead it just kind of ended..... When I was finished reading it I felt disappointment that I spent so much time reading the book at all. I would say this is definitely not her best book. I was disappointed."
2,Nothing special,"I am amazed this book got such great reviews. I had to push myself through it, and was bored the entire time. For the first half of the book I was still confusing the characters (whose mom was Gus again?). I attribute this to lack of character development. The story was painfully predictable, but had the characters been a little bit more interesting I may not have cared so much. A complete bore from first page to last. Not one of the characters seemed ""real"", and I find it hard to believe that anyone (like in previous reviews) could have shed a tear reading this lifeless story."
1,Trite and Unconvincing,"I read this book on the basis of the many glowing reviews previously written and I was very disappointed. The characters were unsympathetic and one-dimensional. I guess I don't understand the ""small town"" mentality but it seems a little sick that the parents never wanted anything more from their children than for them to fall in love and live happily ever after without ever experiencing what else is out there.The writing is also quite mediocre and the trial is not very credible. I'm very sorry to have wasted the time that I spent reading this book."
2,high school writer?,"Though the overall story was entertaining, I was sadly disappointed that this was a ""final draft."" Throughout the entire book, I was continually caught up in the amount of grammatical/conventional errors. About a quarter of the way through, I was tempted to get out a red pen and circle the errors to then send back the book to the editing company. I've never read a book with so many errors. There were countless times ""an"" was written instead of ""a,"" repeated words (""she she said"") were throughout, and I ran into a couple of spelling errors.If this book had been read over a couple of times by even a high school English teacher, I probably would have enjoyed it more."
2,Don't Read This Book,"I read this book about teenage suicide several years ago and was incensed at the iresponsiblity of the author in romanticising in a sick Romeo and Juliett type of way two obviously disturbed teens contemplating and finally commiting this selfish act!Teenagers have enough to contend with in this day and age with drugs,sex,violence,peer pressure and absent parents.I hope Ms.Picoult's own children never read or take this book seriously or the rest of the children throughout the world.Highly irresponsible writing.This is no ""love story"".It is a nightmare."
1,Disappointing and shallow,"I started reading this book with high expectations since it was recommended to me by a friend who loved it. I am terribly disappointed. The book is filled with shallow, conceited characters and I had a hard time feeling sorry for, or even liking, most of them. The whole plot just doesn't ring true. Chris and Emily were basically pushed into an unnatural relationship by both sets of parents who were trying to live their lives vicariously through their children. They seemed to have no lives or friends outside their rather incestuous little circle. Do people really live this way? I haven't finished the book yet so I don't know what the ending is, but I have no doubt it will be just as implausible as the rest of the story. Don't waste your time."
3,ok book,"The first book shes written that I have read that I was not that thrilled about! Usually im so engrossed i dont put her books down until i am done reading them, and it took two weeks or maybe a little more to get through this one, and its not even a long one!"
5,Amazing,I've read this book several times and I'm always shocked at the ending. A definite page turner you won't be able to put it down.
3,Great characters left to die,"This book had me from the get go. I loved the characters. I was invested. And then? I felt like there was a deadline to publish and I was left really irritated. I don't think she did justice to the characters - they were left with a story to tell, but not in a sequel."
4,The Pact,"Been a while since I read it, but it had an interesting story line about young relationships. It can be read by all ages."
4,Great.,First time I have read this author and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have already recommended it and will read more of her.
3,Didn't love it,"I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan, but I was disappointed in this book. I enjoyed most of the story, but the ending was such a let down! I won't spoil it for you, but if you like Jodi Picoult's books, my honest opinion is for you to SKIP this one!"
3,Wore me out!,"This book was written in typical Picoult style. Taking an emotional, thought provoking topic and putting it in real life context. The story moved quickly and was easy to read, however, the whole story line was troubling for me to get my mind around. It's the kind of book that keeps me up late, mind racing. By the end, I was exhausted for the characters and glad it was over! I don't know if I can read another Picoult novel or not! Being the mother of two small children, I find that they just touch a little too close to home for me! That is part of Picoult's mission in the books she writes, so I guess she is successful in what she wants to achieve with her writing."
4,Good read!,"This book was tough to put down. Jodi Picoult is a master at creating story lines with a surprise ending and doesn't disappoint in The Pact. Although I didn't enjoy it as much as My Sister's Keeper, I still highly recommend reading it!"
3,The Pact (Didn't),"Although I have not finished the book, I am enjoying the story although it is very fragmented and is hard to follow the time-line."
5,The Pact is AMAZING!,"I thought the book, The Pact, was a very good book that explores emotions varying from grief to true love. In this book you read about a boy, Chris, and a girl, Emily, that were best friends since birth that as they got older they fell in love. Unfortunately, Emily couldn't handle all the obstacles that life had and was suicidal. It eventually goes into a trial accusing Chris of murder.This book really makes you realize how there can be two completely different views of something that happens, and it also makes you think about your life and really cherish the relationships you have with people because in a moment they could be gone. It will make you think about how you would handle a situation like this, and basically tell you how lucky you are your not in this kind of situation.The Pact is a deep book that will really make you question your life."
3,Great Pact!,I love every Jodi book I have read! Great story line for a family to overcome! This is a great teen and adult read.
3,Good read but unnecessary language,"I enjoyed this read... but I didn't enjoy the foul language in the book. I feel the same point could have been made with out ""gd"" used so frequently."
4,easy read,This book covers disturbing subject matter but is a good book and easy read. I have read several of Jodi Picoult books.
3,Not a real pact,"I have read so many of Jodi Picoults books and have enjoyed many. This I read from a condo I rented in Maui as a loaner. This book is well thought out, but it did not move me or make me really care about Emily the main character Chris or the two families. While it is very well documented and the court scenes seem very real it did not move me like it should have.I did appreciate reading Jodi's actual feelings of the subject and how she in real life would have wanted the story to end. It is not a bad read just not a great one."
1,"Sorry, but not funny","I read this book, and I found it tedious. Too many predictable jokes, too many British stereotypes, and why are so many Brits in Palm Beach? It tries to be Noel Coward and ends up being banal."
2,"It was cute, but not as funny as the title promised","I picked this up because I loved the title. I thought it would be very funny, but I found it a bit tiresome after awhile. Everyone spoke the same. The characters didn't really develop, and even though this was supposed to be amusing, I did want to see them and the plot go further. Not bad, but not really involving, either."
5,Excellent book,An amazing portrayal of an honest man caught in the forces of a history driven by less-upright minds.
1,Horrible,"Absolutely horrible. This man is a Jew hater, whether he is one or not. He wants to show Israel as pagan as the other nations around them. At time they were, but not during King Dovid's rule. And I don't need to be filling my head with this kind of crap. I gave it 1 star only because I had to."
3,good but I thought that the quality of the image would be better,The size of the camera is great and easy to use; I was happy with my purchase the only thing is that the quality of the image in the picture is not perfect. Not bad for the price.
5,The Selfish Giant,After reading this book to my 5 year old dozens of times it is still one of her favorites. The illustrations by Bill Bell captivate her as much as the story. An amazingly clear and moral story. I would recommend this book be on every child's book shelf. This one is a life long keeper!
2,Academic diatribe,"This is art speak at its best - contains a lot of valuable information if you really search for it. The text reads more like a thesis rather than a book. Lots of bulking to fill the covers and a tendency to give the inconsequential consequence. For the academic there are a lot good references, quotations and examples of pompous phraseology. Pity it was not written in plain English - it would have been a ripper!"
4,"Susan and Josie, but no pussycats. . .","Well, it's just another lovely August for suburban sleuth Susan and her handsome husband Jed. The kids are away, and it's just the perfect time for some romance--until the pipes burst and the resulting water damage uncovers a bushel basket of necessary home improvements. Bummer. The only problem is they can't get the obstinate city building inspector to approve their plans. He's busy being a corpse after having been shot with a nail gun. Ouch. Whodunit? Susan gets some unexpected detective help--and a lovely new bathroom--courtesy of contractor Josie Pigeon, who does such a good job here that Valerie's giving her a series of her own. Double your pleasure, ladies. ."
3,master of falconhurst,the book had a sticky substance of some kind on it. That was a little disappointing. Other than that.....great story....great series of books. highly recommend Kyle Onstott and Lance Horner for keeping this series going for years in the early and mid 60's.
4,simple and valuable teachings,"everday miracles reconnects one with the ability to be mindful of the present and how the divine works its magic when we are able to put aside the self doubt and fear of our personalitites. if you would like to discover ways of attracting into your experience that which you are wanting in this physical life, check into this book. Many stories of others success and inspiring tales to get your spirit moving."
2,Ok. But not very realistic,"I think this book has good and bad points. He goes on about being able to manifest anything, but the prerequisite seems to be being a Christian, even though he implies this very subtly. I think he has the right intentions, but this book is really just a long-winded way of expressing the whole 'wishful thinking' epithet. And one can do that without spending money!"
2,TIGHTLY WOUND,THE HOLD ON THIS IS SPRING WOUND TIMER DID NOT WORK.I WROTE ASKING TO HAVE IT REPLACED--TO NO AVAIL.
3,College as One Dreams,"Old-for-teens actors play high-school-senior characters going college to have sex, fun and drinking.Not much action but a sexist stuff, pigs inclusively.Just have a time passed to watch it for."
1,damage on arrival.,"The movie was so scratched up it didn't even work properly. I know the item was used, but it should have worked. Bad buisness."
1,Dreadful,"If I wanted to see a rehash of Superbad, I could do two things:1. Watch the original and indulge in every last minute of it over and over-or-2. Hope they will do a part 2, even though original is untouchable.The movie College, I'm guessing here, was suppose to make Drake Bell into some breakout star and stear him away from the Nickeloden mole. Well he better luck next time and stick to what he knows best. I giggled a few times during this movie, all mainly because most of it was a total rip-off from its big brother Superbad! Oh well thankfully I never paid to see this at the movies or on dvd."
4,Great read,"Makes me wish I had read it when I was younger. Perhaps I wouldn't have liked a required reading in school, but as an older adult I found it interesting."
3,NEED A USA VERSION,"would like to see a usa version. saw this on TV, would like to have a usa dvd.THIS IS A GREAT HISTORY OF THE TANGO AND THE MUSIC AND DANING ARE GREAT"
2,Shadee or Sade,"I was enraptured when I received my video copy of 'diamond life'. However, this turned to disappointment when I discovered it contained an abridged version of the 'same' cd and tape version. Please bring out the original video of Sade singing all of her songs on the 'diamond life' video. I saw the aforesaid video version 'live in concert' while I was living in New Zealand (1988). It was absolutely enthralling. Sade as always is captivating in this video, her sultry voice and good looks help overcome any shortfalls in these 4 short clips. However buyer beware! You are not getting the full compliment of songs. Is this Shadee? Or Sade!"
3,Didn't quite get it...,"Okay, I obviously missed something that other reviewers saw. I liked this book but I didn't love it. I didn't particularly connect with any of the characters. In fact, some of the characters seemed a little too contrived -- Marsha Fillmore seemed like she came right out of a John Grisham novel; Lexi was a little unbelievable as a 6-foot-tall, red-headed, former model/turned priest; and David seemed a little unbelievable as a former professional football player/turned trial lawyer. I could see perhaps any one of these people, but all of these in one setting? Seems a little unlikely to me. Either that, or my life is extremely un-colorful. (My friends and acquaintances seem to be more of the garden variety!) I also didn't care much for Dana who is the main character -- she seemed a little aloof and extremely selfish to me.I did think the book was very well written, so I am giving it three stars. I just don't think it was the most believable."
3,Slow,This book is a good book however it is slow reading and at some times gets really boring and repetitive.
3,"Interesting plot, fizzles and flattens","The characters are at once predictable and yet inconsistent. An example would be a person who is afraid of the dark, and yet loves haunted houses. Leaves me scratching my head, and re-reading to see if I missed something.The storyline sounds interesting, but it never gets off the ground. A disappointing read; though, I admit, I did see it through. It almost seemd like the rough draft that never got fleshed out."
2,Blood Orange,A very thought provoking read. Real characters and events drawn from lifes hardships. Explores marriage and parenthood and exposes our weaknesses and vulnerabilities with depth that is believable.
2,Just so-so,"I thought I was going to like this a lot more than I ended up, even after having read the preview. I only finished it because I paid for it."
5,Service and condition,This item was received in a very short period of time and in excellent condition. Blood Orange by Drucilla Campbell was an great read and I would recommend it to others. In fact our book group will be reading it for next month.
2,Trouble getting started,"I am having trouble getting into this story- The subject matter is good, however I have tried to read it twice now and still cant get into it. Maybe 3rd time is a charm? I want to care about the characters but its a reach- will try again to get past the 3rd chapter and maybe it will get better....."
4,Insightful,This is quite a good overview of the stucture and workings of a large Korean Buddhist monastery and the culture of Buddhist monks in Korea. I don't think that anyone has written a more detailed description of the monk's culture or of the jobs in big monasteries. Parts of it are somewhat dated and there are differences between temples (and people) but for the most part it's pretty accurate. The author's stories about his experiences are also interesting. I didn't give it five stars because the book might seem a bit dry at times for some people.
3,.........,"In my opinion the only way a person could say this is a perfact soundtrak is if they like Country, Gangster Rap, Punk Rock, Folk and New Age. That's how diverse it is. I hate Country and I don't care that much for New Age either. Songs that make it worth listing to are ""Folk Boy"" by Lard, ""Wating For a Miracel"" and ""The Future"" by Leonard Cohen(which have very perfound lyrics to them) ""Burn"" by Nine Inch Nails, and the two Rap songs ""The Day the Niggas Took Over"" by Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg, and ""What Would U do"" by the Dogg Pound. It seems the only good rap around anymore is from the old School in my opinion."
2,WHAT A TRAGIC WASTE OF AN A-TO-D CONVERTER,"Inspiring? No! Pleasant? No! Entertaining? No! Worthwhile? No!What are you folks sniffing out there anyway? Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip!Even the Dylan track is junk! The entire CD is essentially drivel, put to the dull, homicide-provoking sound of endless, droning noise, with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one (1.0)!!! What a WASTE of an A-to-D converter!"
5,Piece of art - don't miss to feel it,"Some say dialogues were not expected on this CD, however I find every decision in this compilation justified. Because it is one of those perfect things, you can occasionally come over. Variety of artists, sounds from film itself, extremely hard and soft things bound together give birth to great quality to be enjoyed. This is not typical, no - but what would art be worth, if it was? ;-)"
3,Damn Ambitious and Gutsy...but I think it succeeded,"A lot of people thought Trent Reznor did a better job with Lost Highway than he did with this...maybe he did, but this is a well compiled soundtrack. As is the case with most movies these days, the CD only has about half the music from the movie...but who cares? This soundtrack drives you with both pounding contravertial lyrics from classic and contemporary music stars with some of the best lines of dialogue from the film. The version of NIN's ""Something I Can Never Have"" is satisfying in that it is more instrumental, but only possesses the first verse...oh well. The soundtrack is good enough for me."
3,A bit Risque',I am a 60 year-old grandmother and though I really like this music do feel it isn't the best to have around children. I owned it when my children were teenagers and decided it was not setting a good example so got rid of it. Now that my children are out of my home I have purchased it again and still find the subject matter a bit disturbing but find that if I ignore the words I can still enjoy the beat of the music. I would rate it an R though for young people.
4,Wicked but good,"The music, on this soundtrack, is totally appropriateto the movie. Great variety of artists - some newto me. And, the songs really stick in your mind.Menacing and sad, but great."
5,AWESOME,It was a great movie ad soundtrack when it was released and it still is. There is some great music on this sundtrack that has stood the 1st decade of it's release.
5,A Classic,"I have to say that this soundtrack is timless and will stay as a landmark in soundtracks for decades to come. Can't list all the great tracks here, Dylan's You be long to me, or Patsy Cline's Back in Baby's arms, Leonard Cohen.... or the more 'violent' tracks.. there are tracks for every taste, and every mood. and of course the soundtrack is a must for this movie lovers as it recalls every great scene as you listen to it. This soundtrack along with Pulp Fiction are a must in every 'soundtrack' section. its a genius blend of different songs from different eras and different styles."
3,Edits detract from this soundtrack compilation.,"This is a great collection of songs but several of them are edited to include voiceovers from the movie. I wish I'd paid more attention and been aware of that before I bought the CD. Maybe some people will enjoy it, but I find it annoyingly intrusive. I don't know if it was Trent Reznor's choice or if he was asked to include the dialogue, but it was a pretty stupid decision."
4,Silly fun,"This is a silly monster movie from the 80's - lots of great one liners and Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley, Jr. make a great comedy team. There is even a very sexy Geena Davis (before the Fly andCutthroat Island). Michael Richards (Kramer from Seinfield)shows the physical comedy genius that he showed inUHF. Carol Kane's character is both adorable and irritaing and she plays it beautifully!"
2,It was ok...,I normally like wacky humor but just couldn't get into this one. It does have its moments but I would just rent it from a video store.
3,Stealing the movie from the stars,"Sometimes the funniest bits are not from the so-called stars. My husband and I love this movie only for certain parts. Forget Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr! The parts featuring Carol Kane, Joseph Bologna, and John Byner are excellent and hilarious. They stole the movie! You can tell they had fun doing this one. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr and Michael Richards weren't very funny, mostly just silly. Still, this is in our collection."
5,Great old movie,I love this movie. It is so funny and makes my day when I see it. One movie I can watch over and over.
4,"""A rape factory?""","A great old comedy, Transylvania 6-5000 features a splendid cast such as Carol Kane, Geena Davis, Jeff Goldblum to name a few. Set in Transylvania, it features werewolves, vampires, Frankenstein and his monster among other things and is all extremely silly. I just wish I had that telephone in my home."
4,"Laughable, lighthearted film.",A good film with a relaxable plot. It's a nice light movie. I enjoyed Michael Richards role best. The film gave me some great laughs!!!
2,The Monster Squad This Isn't,"Going in to this movie, I expected something along the lines of The Monster Squad. Boy, was I wrong. Not only do we have to wait until the movie is half way over before the ""monsters"" get much screen time, but this is a spoof that is never laugh out loud funny. Sure, I giggled a few times, but that's it. And a lot of the actors/characters are so over-the-top in their weirdness that it annoyed me. Actually, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Begley Jr., Norman Fell (in a great cameo), and Geena Davis are the only actors who didn't annoy me at any point in the film. I enjoyed the scenes with ""Frankenstein"", but it was too little too late."
2,People liked this movie and thought it was funny?,"It's stupid! God, the jokes are not inventive, people...this is not comedy...The cast is good...thats why I give it a ""2""...else....It's idiotic! I love comedy's...hell I even think the Three Stooges are good for laughs...but this...this is good for High School kids with Grade School minds...If you are an adult with an IQ about 100, please stay away from this movie...If it takes you 10 minutes to figure out which side of the DVD is up and which is down, then this movie is for you!"
1,Don't say I didn't warn you,"I figure I can score big karma points if I can warn at least one person away from Transylvania 6-5000. It's not just that the film isn't funny. For long stretches it doesn't even seem to be TRYING to be funny. No doubt the huge commercial success of the vastly superior Young Frankenstein led to the greenlighting of this less-than-inspired horror ""spoof."" The irony is that director Rudy DeLuca is an associate of Mel Brooks. Good cast, but even Jeff Goldblum and Joseph Bologna can't salvage material this weak. Anyone who says this film is funny is: A. Tripping; B. Insane; C. Not a particularly discriminating viewer, to put it mildly, and would probably laugh just as hard at Full House reruns or Bazooka Joe comics. Trust me on this one."
5,Transylvania 6-5000,I love this movie when I was a kid. I got it off Amazon. First it was purchased Downloaded off Amazon and you could only watch it on my PC so.......... I decided to purchase the DVD that's why I have 2two2! It still an Awesome movie!
5,Love this movie,"I love both Jeff Goldblum and Ed Bagley Jr. Both wonderful early actors of their time. Gina Davis, and all the full cast of characters was very enjoyable to watch, stitches in my side from laughter.... Just love this movie."
4,very enjoyable,"I read these for relaxation and pleasure, for the period and the enduring character of Great Aunt Vespasia. Always looking for her to appear in any of this series of Anne Perry's novels."
2,Bethlehem Road,"I read this book and my opinion of it is the following:yes,Sir Garnet Royce had no business locking his wife in her room, that's false imprisonment and against the law. Now,Naomi has every right to believe what religion she wants. She's an adult. She did try to talk to her husband. He did try to talk to her. Now,here's the problem. Both dealt with the problem in very immature ways. She CHOSE to starve herself to get her way and force her husband to change. He CHOSE to lock her in her room to get his way. They are both stubborn and set in their ways. They chose not to compromise. Very childish. Naomi should have known when she married Garnet that he was older and a rigid,fixed person and bringing about radical change to him would be something he didn't want. What happened to her was a tragedy. The maid,Elsie had no business killing innocent MPs."
4,Why would anyone kill a politician? You'll be surprised.,"Is it political intrigue or domestic intrigue? take a guess! Perry and her characters show us all of the victims of disenfranchisement in Victorian England. A bit hard to believe how much power men had over women, how they exercised it in the absolute certitude of their rightness, and how little others questioned. But then, the imbalance of power, in whatever setting, inevitably leads to abuse and there are bullies everywhere, refined and not, Victorian era, or Clinton era. This mystery keeps one going most of the way through, and has some suprises. Perry's endings are always tight and abrupt, but she usually ties up all the loose ends, so one adjusts to the sudden end. However, this time either I missed it, or there was no explanation for the policeman who was knocked out and left in the Park (almost dead). Who did that, and why? Did I miss it, or did Ms Perry?"
3,Didn't fix my headset.,"Maybe I didn't buy the exact right replacement battery, but it didn't fix my Netcom headset and I ended up buying a different one."
5,Origin of the Total War Series,"It was great to finally get to buy Shogun, it was the original game in the great Total War series and I just thought that I had to own it. At first its strange to get used to the controls but in the end they work just the same.The graphics aren't comparable to todays' graphics but they shouldn't be. Shogun came out in 2000 and the graphics are just fine for a game from that year. The gameplay is fun and I also like that the game takes place in the interesting period known as the Sengoku Jidai (The Age of the Country at War). Shogun makes for a great game. I recommend it to players of the Total War series who are interested in the roots of the series..."
3,I love these but the shipping is ridiculous.,I purchase these at my local salon and I love them. My only complaint is that the black coating WILL come off. I go through many packs because of that problem..the coating comes off after first wearing and need to be thrown away so you'll end up going through many packs over a months time.
2,Synthetics.,Good model.Looks good.You have to buy two sizes too small.For example.Your L = S.But it is synthetic.Do not they feel.On the body pricked.There's no cotton.In the heat can not be worn.this is not ClimaLite.I'm sorry but it's true.Real ClimaLite soft and gentle to the body - this shirt is not the same.Asked to write a review.I have written.
4,Adidas polo,Feels a little larger than XXL but a couple times through the washer and I'm sure it will fit better.
5,Great Wear resistance and Good Feel,"I have had a few of these shirts for a couple of years. They have worn very well over time. I like the feel, and VERY wrinkle resistant. The size runs big, but I like that for a more relaxed fix."
2,Nice shirt - horrible sizing,"I'm usually between a small and medium, admittedly a slight frame - about 5'11"" 160. I ordered the small in this shirt (two of them) and they are at least 2 sizes too large; I'm absolutely swimming in it. I'm not sure who they thought they were sizing these for, but this is huge, even by standard fat-american sizing standards. I'm returning both for something, likely by Nike, who has proper sizing on their apparel."
1,Wrong size,I bough a white L size polo and looks like a XXL size polo!!!! now i have a really great gift to my fat uncle :(
1,wasted opportunity,"The story in Atonement was good enough to make a really terrific movie. This version was so bad! I have no idea how it got an award. Traffic noise in the background,long blank spaces which may have been meant to create a pregnant pause but encouraged ennui.Hopefully someone will accept a challenge and make a version which brings out the true pathos and futility of war and it's consequences. The chickens were good."
5,Any college-level arts collection strong in fabric art - as well as many a needlework library - needs this definitive guide,"Irene Emery's construction of a comprehensive system of terminology for describing fabrics, The Primary Structures of Fabrics, was recognized as a classic on the first publication of The Primary Structures of Fabrics back in 1966. It is based on years of study of fabrics produced both by hand and by machine, and offers a solid survey of the structural makeup of fabrics and their pieces. Any college-level arts collection strong in fabric art - as well as many a needlework library - needs this definitive guide."
2,Another sleeper/dud from B&S...,"Geez, Harvest House turns to gold everything these 2 write. B&S write 365 books a year and I keep buying them. The sorrow here is that Christians dying to b feed buy these outlines then get discouraged because B&S's outlines r so poor. The only reason I keep buying their books is because of their ONLY worthy outline and also a masterpiece, 'B&S's Guide To Bible Prophecy' which has been discontinued. Life is truly unfair at times. B ruce and Stan, I'm sorry guys but when u can sit down and write something decent for the public to buy I'll cut u some slack."
4,Great Book by a Great Poet,"This collection of W.S. Merwin's earlier poems provides a great introduction to his large body of work. So far, I've read his books The Shadow of Sirius and Flower & Hand. There is a poem in Flower & Hand called ""The Houses"". It has a haunting quality to it that is unmistakable. His work is unremarkable (in the best sense of that word). It does not surprise me that he is Poet Laureate of the United States. His book The Shadow if Sirius is the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry."
3,Slinky spazz,"3 1/2For the most part this is good stuff, surprisingly dynamic, and arguably Claypool's most justified side project which at best shows the eternal frontman-prankster at his vocally and instrumentally retrained peak, slipping more into a steady rhythm with his former bandmates as opposed to dominating front and center which he often tends to do. If not for the relatively weak last leg rambling on a bit directionless this would be a must have for any fan of his."
3,Riddles are abound tonight,"Jangly, and disjointed -- just as one would expect from the original Primus lineup. This album is pretty simple, but definitely worth owning. Only a few songs stand out, but to each his/her own...Others have already detailed the highlights of this album, so there isn't any point in re-hashing all of that.If you are a LC fan, you should probably own this one."
3,"The weird cousin of ""Primus"".","This 10 year old only album from ""Sausage"" should please those fans of ""Primus"" looking for something different. And even though it's a bit stranger and more experimental, it sounds like a ""Primus"" album to my ears. However, there's no ""Tommy The Cat"" or ""My Name Is Mud"" on here. The only single I'm aware of, and the best song, is ""Riddles Are Abound Tonight"". Very good. Then ""Toyz 1988"" seems to be a take on ""Toys Go Winding Down"" from the ""Frizzle Fry"" album. Overall, depending on how you look at it, this is either the best album from ""Sausage"", or a weaker one from ""Primus"". A must for fanatics though."
5,Strangest Album Ever- Wrap Your Head Around It,"This is a Claypool album that, even after months of listening, I still find it to be quite the enigma. However, I do love it. Here are the tracks and their ratings:Prelude To Fear- 5/5Riddles Are Abound Tonight- 5/5Here's To The Man- 5/5Shattering Song- 4/5Toz 1988- 3/5Temporary Phase- 5/5Girls For Single Men- 5/5Recreating- 5/5Caution Should Be Used While Driving...- 5/5Overall, a very good album, and easily a great addition to any Claypool collection. However, approach with Caution...pun intended."
2,"For fans only? No, only for REALLY BIG fans of Les","I too am a Primus fan. There's something about this album, though, that just seems missing. I saw Les's Flying Frog Brigade the other night, and that was great. But this album is worth passing on for other stuff."
3,Primus's evil twin.,"I hate to compare this to Primus because this NOT Primus this is Suasage (Although Sausage was once Primus). This album sounds like a dark evil demented version of Primus. This album is cool cause it doesn't try to sound like Primus. It goes in it's own direction. The vocals are more melodic and musical although not as catchy and cool as Primus. Jay lane does a great job on set, and Todd Huth plays some sweat ass blues inspired guitar. If you like Primus just a little you'll hate the hell out of this album. If you like 'em a lot you still might not like the album. If you are obsessed with Les Claypool it's a must have. If not I suggest you save your money and buy something else."
2,not up to normal jet quality,"The table for the disc is very hard to adjust since neither surface is machined you tighten one side it puts the other side out of adjustment. The front table for the belt was a little better but the adjustment is held by one bolt,and there is no index to go by so it has to be checked with a square after each belt change.No matter how much you try to tighten the bolt the leverage on the table cause it to move very easily. Also there is no dust collection on the machine at all which with a sander would be nice to have."
4,minor design quirks,"Better system than the excaliber type system, excellent accuracy with 48"" crosscut capacity, table extension for long sheets is a little cheesy, t-nut fence design makes putting the alumium bar back on a little tedious. Unless you are going to use something like an Altendorf or other large panel saw, this is the way to go."
3,Useful but short,This book gives you a glimpse of retail business. Helpful but lacks of more detailed info on operation. I think this is just a compilation of articles from a certain book/mag.
1,shipping overpriced,"The way this company explains their shipping cost is not clear and I ended up paying more than half the cost of the lamp shade in shipping. When I received the lamp shade, I was terribly dissapointed in the quality. So I sent it back. Don't waist your time."
3,Not to impressed,"This does not fit standard lamps. My local ""lamp guy"" said it is fit for European lamps<?>,so, he took another shade apart and rigged the lamp base so this shade would fit."
5,very satisfied,This was a baby shower gift. Even nicer or just as nice as the picture. I thought it a little pricey but like I said was a gift. It also has matching baby room items just as nice.
3,Smaller than thought,I ordered this at great expense to be delivered to the Uk. Although the item itself is of a good quality it s much smaller than I expected and suited to a table lamp not a ceiling light fitting as I thought.
3,lamp shade,"Again, I thought I was buying the whole lamp, But the shade is nice, it should go with a really small stand as the shade to is small."
3,Cute Shade - terrible shipping costs!! Will not buy from this seller again!!,"The shade matches the bedding very well. My single-mom daughter ordered it, wanting her baby's nursery to be perfect. It looks great and she's very pleased with how it looks on the $8 lamp base we found at WalMart. However, the shipping cost was ridiculous - the seller doesn't make it clear at all as to how the shipping is computed. The final cost of the shade with shipping was almost $40 - way too much!!! Will not buy from this seller again!!"
1,Nice looking.... BUT...,The lamp shade is nice and goes great with the rest of the set. Came perfectly packaged!Never have been able to find a base that it fits on... So while it looks nice if you don't have a lamp to go with it what is the point!?
1,never got it,"I never recieved this one either. I'm very upset. wasted money. not buying from amazon again. delivered to door with no signing required, must have been stolen. No one would help me said it was my fault and I'd have to pay again to recieve my items. NO THANK YOU!"
5,Educational fun with George,"In ""Curious George's ABCs,"" one of the most famous characters from children's literature guides the reader through the alphabet. Each entry is illustrated by a noun that begins with that letter. To reinforce the alphabet, each letter is actually incorporated into the illustration. For example, the alligator's mouth opens in an angle that physically encloses the letter ""A"".Curious George, the loveable monkey of the title, shows up as an observer or participant in most of the entries. As illustrated by H.A. Rey, George is as appealing as ever. I especially liked the illustration of George, bundled up in a snowsuit, looking at an ""icy icicle."" This is a good book for children learning the alphabet."
4,For older babies,"My son (15 months) loves his Curious George books, but he doesn't love this book. George isn't the main character in the book. Each letter is a different character (A-Alligator) and George is seen just a tiny bit throughout the book. I wouldn't actually call this a Curious George book!"
4,Smal book,"This book is very cute. My grandson likes it. However, it was much smaller that I expected. Looks sturdy though.."
2,"fair, but hard to reference information, tedious format","We are using this book in an Eastern Religions class. The ""Daddy can I ask you a question"" format gets tiresome very quickly. A lot of new-age stuff that isn't Hinduism is included, as well as pop-science theorys. Hinduism suffers many of the same shortcomings as other religions. I'd rather see a less biased source, than a father clearly trying to convince an impressionable child ""yes, absolutely you are a Hindu"". If I wanted to know whether or not Hinduism was for me, I wouldn't choose this book."
3,Not what I expected,Maybe I was expecting something more from this book.... It is a very matter of fact type... I was looking for the science behind why we hindus do certain things .... The book just brushes over them...Though if you r a new bee to hinduism and want to know the facts of the religion..this is the book for u....
3,Not for beginners!,"I mean,if u are a person who wants to know what Hinduism is,this book is not usefull. author talks a lot of not pre defined terms the good part is answers to his son(?) very breifly.Iam a Hindu,even i realise that i knew nothing about hinduism before reading his book very informative not illustrative!"
3,"Well researched, poorly written","The author here has truly done a tremendous amount of research into Hinduism, and presents a wealth of information for the reader. However, I doubt I would recommend this book to any but the most critical of minds. The book seemed very patronizing in tone, and while he was presenting an enormous amount of material, it felt, at times, that I wasn't getting the whole story (even if I was). Furthermore, for all his references to Christianity, he only appears to understand Christianity within the terms of Hinduism, and does not understand Christianity in terms of itself. The information presented on Hinduism here, however, is vast and informative. If you can get past the tone and writing style, there is much to learn here."
5,A must read for everyone,"I was introduced to the book in a very diferent situation. My 17 year son bought the book ,he read it and recommended it to me.I thought it must be another book by some religious fanatic. I didn't read it then. Unfortunately my son died in a road accident soon.I was devastated, needed so many answers to my questions, about life and death,mysteries of life, and I found this book in my sons library.Though it didnt answer all the questions cropping in my mind, but did take me to the path for search for more answers.I have shared this book with scores of my freinds, and recommend to all to once go through the questions and answers so nicely compiled and written by Mr. Vishwanathan."
3,Not bad but...,"In general, I thought the book was okay, but a few things bothered me:1) The format of a kid asking the questions which seemed to take the discussion in one direction and ignore others.2) No index or contents.3) Topics that make my doubt how credible the rest of the book is. (One example of this is when the author talks of the Mayan indians traveling to India.)Oh well, it's still an interesting book."
5,A non-Hindu Review,"I just was introduced to the tenets of Hinduism a few months ago, and reading this book brought me farther into the depths of understanding. In an easily readily conversational style of writing, Viswanathan creates a comprehensive picture of the great way of life. Some of the book contains rituals and history of scripture, which can be hard for an ""outsider"" to read, but the essence of Hinduism is pronounced strongly by the rest of the text. Very effective overall."
5,am I not a Hindu?,"many of my friends ask me a lot of staff about Hinduism, including why being an American, I pratice Hindu dharma. I often ask them to read this book. I also tell them a very simple truth: you are also a Hindu. I believe that everyone borne in this Earth is a Hindu first. because Hinduism is all about Vedic truth, about the natural presence of spiritual shakti in our heart."
3,I never actually read it.,"I bought it for a school project, I actually ripped out a bunch of pages, covered it in blood, and shot it with a gun haha."
4,History of the New England Mob,"Anyone from New England, and particularly Providence, will find this a fascinating read. Most of the book concerns the mid-1960's gang war that left a slew of dead bodies all over Boston and Providence. If you're at all interested in the true story of Raymond Patriaca and his band of merry men, this book is for you. The author, by the way, became a federal witness and his whereabouts is a well-kept secret."
5,great,"i have been tring to find this book, it has to do with my family. (munge) was my grandfather. I called him dado. I would really like a copy of this book if i could find it. i would like to to a family history on the rossettis' I barely remember him. But i remember he would sit me on his lap and i would smoke his cigars."
4,90s Britpop,"Well though this may be Bush's best album so far, the innovative sounds in this one still prove daring for a band who has been on their peak for more than 10 years..."
1,Only an Essay,"Although the material covered is interesting, this is not a ""book"". In fact I am being generous in calling it an ""essay"" as it is very short and can be read easily in less than an hour. Some of the information related is available from other sources. Even at $2.25, the price is not worth the short read. This should not be listed as a ""book"""
2,Disappointed,"Bought this to use as a duty light. The first issue was the switch. If the light was bumped, the switch would go on and it couldn't be shut off, with out unscrewing the battery cover, and breaking the connection. Then it would get stuck in the strobe mode. Then the rubber cover to the side switch came out and I found it on the ground next to the car. And it is pretty much impossible to put back into the light. It's bright, but not nearly what I expected. I since purchased a Surefire G3, which is brighter and more compact, with no switch issues. I also have never found an actual use for the strobe. I have owned several Streamlights, most of which still work, but I wanted to change over to the LED. Perhaps later versions of this light will be better."
2,why !,I purchased thing about a year ago and yes it worked good but then it started going through the rechargable batteries. i tried def. chargers thinking something may be wrong with mine but that did not seem to work. The flash light works great when it would charge. But the times are a little off. high beam your lucky to get 45 min. thats kind redic. for the price you pay.I would recommend the the Coast p14 its a lot brighter and the times r more accurate about 100hrs real hours on full beam. and you can get new AA batteries in about 2 minutes compared to the 6 hours it takes to charge one of these streamlights. Good Luck.
1,frustration,The switch quit working almost immediately. I sent it to their authorized repair shop. They said nothing was wrong and returned it. Would not work again. Finally called the factory and they said they would fix it right. So I sent it to them. The second time I used it after I got it from the factory the flashlight still would not work.
3,Not bad for the price.,"I have an HP vp6310. This projector mount was very inexpensive when compared to other universal mounts, and it is very sturdy and works as advertised.I would easily give it 4 or 5 stars, but the kit did not come with the appropriate size bolts for the HP vp6310. It DOES come with about ten different sizes bolts which is great, it just didn't have a small enough thread for the vp6310."
4,"Good quality, inexpensive","Easy to use, attaches securely. Came with lots of screws, washers, spacers, etc. The mount splits apart into two pieces so you can attach anchor to the ceiling and attach the mount to the projector then join the two together. I only wish the connector between the ceiling mount and projector bracket was a bit easier to use. its secure but difficult to attach with the provided screw."
3,Does what it is designed for,"I used this to mount my EPSON 3020 projector. The mount works and is reasonable for the price. The reason this did not get higher ratings is:- The quality of screws/connectors is not great. This shipped with an allen key with which I could not open one of the arms. Eventually I had to mount the projector with just 3 arms, and had to leave the fourth arm as it was shipped- Instructions are not too great. You have to figure things out a bit by yourself ( which was not too hard)Once I got past the obstacle of being able to handle the allen keys( the keys would just not latch on well to the screws), and the projector was mounted, it looks and works great."
4,Worked for Epson 8350,"It took me a while to figure out but I got this to work on my 8350. I used the extra legs included as extensions in order to reach the mounts on the projector. One problem I had was the main central support is a press fit and it came un-pressed so my mount isn't rigid but gravity keeps it in place. Overall, the price is right and it works for mounting my projector. I could have spent more and got a better product but this was cheap and it works so I like it for what it is."
5,Don't Hesitate!,"Buy this! Do not hesitate.The quality is excellent. It's very sturdy and strong. For $50 it can't be beat. I feel like I could hang from this thing from my ceiling, and I'm a big guy."
4,Great for the price,"I first had this installed in a room with a wooden ceiling but recently moved it to my patio home theatre where it is bolted into a steel beam. It's great for me because of the quick release mechanism. It allows me to mount and unmount the projector fairly quickly and easily so I can secure it when not in use.The adjustments can be finicky but the mount is well built and holds my Optoma projector very well. I was able to use it without having to reposition my track lighting which is right in front the mount.All in all, a great mount that does the job and won't break the bank. Highly recommended."
5,Projector Mount,I have installed a few ceiling mounted projector and this mount is the best one I have seen so far. It is simple to install and well built and priced lower than the competitors versions. The seller has good prompt service. 100% satisfied.
5,Best Buy for the Buck ...,"Truly a great, versatile projector flush mount. If you need a flush projector mount, your search can stop here - buy it! In the beginning, I've gone from wooden shelf; to a cheap nylon-and-aluminum pivot ball mount; and finally, to this Atdec mount. Would've been cheaper and must less aggravating if I had just purchased this projector mount from the very beginning. Keep a 6'' crescent wrench and an extra long-handled 6mm allen key wrench handy to aid in installation and adjustments."
5,Mount,This universal mount is truly universal and will adapt to any projector with the right choice of included brackets. The finished result looks neat and sturdy and has more than enough adjustment possibilities. Very happy with the purchase
2,Potential great product but but needs help,"This item worked properly, but installing it was like taking a trip from hell. The screws were installed such that they could not be removed. I had to drill out one of them to get the others free. Luckily the company provided extra hardware. If I was not an engineer with great tools and skills, I would have sent it back for a refund."
5,worked great for my optoma hd66,"Maybe its a newer version, but my mount included clear instructions on how to use. It worked perfectly for my Optoma HD66 which has the same size hookup as the HD20/65/180. I would definitely recommend."
4,Good quality but not for Optoma HD20,"This is a good quality mount, however it does not work with the Optoma HD20 unless you modify it. I drilled a hole in the metal mounting plate and it works fine."
3,It's okay,I got this for my HD20 projector and it did not have the screws I needed. I had to make a trip to the harware store. I would like to fin out if any mount is easy to instal and get a perfect level picture but after some work I was able to git it done. I don't think I would buy this mount again.
2,Initial Assembly Difficult,"Mount assembly is well documented and should be easy to accomplish. However, two of the allen head set screws that had to be loosened were tightened so much at the factory that the retaining nuts were deformed. Attempting to remove the allen head screws resulted in stripping both of the screws. I had to drill out the screws and use an easy-out tool to remove them. On the positive side, the kit comes with a wide assortment of hardware, including extra allen head screws and retaining nuts.Directions were well written and once I got through the issue of the overtorqued screws, assembly and leveling was easy."
5,works with mits hc4900,"solid little bracket, all the adjustments you'll need, great price and comes with many sizes of screws. works well with my mitsubishi hc4900 right out of the box."
2,Ceiling plate fused to bracket,"I received a few of the units in which the quick release ""removable"" ceiling mount was not functional because it was fused to the bracket. I have tried everything to unfuse them, but no luck. It appears that there is not enough clearance between the cylinder of the bracket and the ceiling mount and the coating has fused. On a few units I was able to twist the ceiling mount around about 50 times causing the coating to peel off and then it finally released. Very frustrating because now we will have to take the whole bracket and ceiling plate down to perform maintenance on the ceiling projectors."
2,Not for HD20,"This is absolutely not a fit for Optoma HD20. I don't know how it fits other projectors, but if you have hd20 look somewhere else.The mounting assembly is too big for the tiny optoma and it is too hard to fit it in. If you try the centroid method the manual suggests, its nearly impossible to align the holes to match. Once you put it together and mount it on the ceiling, it will still have some tiny wobble and adjusting to fit the screen is quite a task. Tightening the bolts does not really help so much.The only good thing is that the piece that attaches to the ceiling is very strong and well built.In general, remember to loosen the bolts before hoisting it on the ceiling. You will have to oil the bolts and put a lot of strength to loosen them. They are terribly tight.Stay away from it if you have a HD20!"
3,Decent Mount,This mount is decent for the price. It is definately sturdy enough and simple enough to install. However the pan and tilt adjustements arene't very solid. It is difficult to get everything level and square with the world so the picture lines up witht he screen properly.
3,Okay product but comes without the shaft,"The product itself is constructed well and very is very sturdy. Looks a bit complicated to setup at first. The picture currently being shown of the product shows a shaft (a rod with holes to make the product longer), but this product actually does not have the shaft, so the projector will be very near to the ceiling, which is not suitable for vaulted ceiling or suspended ceiling. Had to return mine. Return transaction with amazon went smoothly."
4,"A bit pricey, but did the job","This is a solid mount. Other than not including the screw/bolt you'll need to attach this to the ceiling, it has everything you'll need."
4,Great product - Easy to intall,I bought this product to mount my Mitsubishi HD1000U 720p High Definition DLP Home Theater Projector. It comes with pre assembled and easy to mount.
2,* No mounting hardware included*,The unit comes with everything that is needed to adjust the mount to your projector.One would thing that a ceiling mount for a projector MIGHT come with bolts to put it into the ceiling? Thankks Atdec! Now I get to run to the hardware store because I need two bolts to put into my ceiling. I was stupid to think that standard universal bolts would be included. Granted that not every ceiling is the same but they could have included two bolts/screws that could be screwed into a ceiling joice.I'll update this later once I have all the appropriate hardware. I am very angry about this. I can't believe the reviewers above didn't mention it.I bought the bolts and all is good. It still wasn't fun to drive to the store for bolts. That would be an addled 3 cents cost and I would have paid 1 dollar more for the included hardware.
5,two weeks with this unit,"I wrote an earlier review. Now that I have had some time with it, I still must say I am impressed with the quality.The only con I have discovered is that the unit I got did have some dead pixels. I found two in my unit. This however I would not so much fault the maker, but the nature of the technology. I suspect all are subject to it. You also have to really really be looking for it to see them. They kind of look like sparkling stars on an all black scene."
5,Great!,"This is a movie I grew up watching, so being able to find it on DVD, and for such a low price,was fantastic. Maybe not a great movie per se, but it appealed to my nostalgia. Fast shipping and great service, as always."
4,A good popcorn movie,"Okay, no one here is in Oscar contention, let's get that out of the way. But if you take it at face value, it is a decent popcorn movie. The story is okay, the scenery is beautiful and the action is compelling. Bridgette Nielson is beautiful and her sword fighting is fun to watch. Meanwhile the Actor's Studio is not going to have anyone watch Ms. Nielsen and Mr. Schwarzenegger (playing a ""Conan"" like figure) anytime soon. I was replacing my old VHS tapes and had just purchased the two ""Conan"" movies - so I bought this too. It had been a decade or more since I watched it last, and it was still a pretty fun movie to watch, I've certainly watched worse (""Blair Witch 2"" I'm talking to you)."
4,Red Sonja,"After her family is murdered a young woman named Red Sonja becomes a master of the sword and seeks revenge on the evil queen responsible for the mayhem that has befallen her. Also, it seems the queen has stolen a powerful, carefully guarded, glowing orb right before it was meant to be destroyed, one that has powers of its' own, allowing for the possessor to control elemental forces and call down storms and earthquakes, if they so wish. Kalidor, one of the individuals in place to oversee the destruction of the orb, joins forces with Red Sonja, as their paths may differ, but they ultimately lead to the same place. An impudent, young prince named Tarn and his guard/manservant Falkon, whose kingdom was unceremoniously wiped out by Gerden as a test for her newfound powers, soon joins them. Entertaining movie, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger."
4,loved it,"Bad acting bad hair, decent fighting, beautiful brigette just like i remembered-everything you want from an eighties movie. Good buy"
3,Red Sonya,"I watched this along time ago, i bought this movie, because i've collecting all comic book movies and i needed this movie for my dvd collection."
3,Epic Classic :),"Classic fun movie. My wife has had this movie as a guilty pleasure on VHS for years, finally glad to have found it on DVD for her to enjoy. Cheesy by the nature, but if you love the original Conan and those movies you'll enjoy this one."
2,Lame,"The supporting role from good 'ol Ah-nold is enough to watch Red Sonja, a film made after the equally lame Conan the Destroyer (that film and this are were both directed by Richard Fleischer), and the real kicker here folks: even though Red Sonja takes place in the world of pulp author Robert E. Howard, Arnold doesn't play the warrior king that made him famous. If you can get past that, there actually are a few redeeming qualities, such as the casting of Brigitte Nielsen as Sonja, who physically is perfect for the role. She faces off against an evil empress (Sandahl Bergman, from Conan the Barbarian) seeking revenge with help from good 'ol Ah-nold. Even though this was made in 1985 and the excellent Conan the Barbarian was made in 1982, it's amazing how Conan has aged gracefully and this hasn't aged well at all. Red Sonja was lame then, and it's still lame now, so if you've never seen it, you're not missing much, and are better off sticking with your Conan the Barbarian DVD."
2,Where's Conan?,"The only way this movie could be worse is if Arnold wasn't in it. A real dud. Brigitte Nielsen is nice to look at but she can't carry this movie on looks alone. A waste of Arnold's time. If you're looking for a third ""Conan"" movie this isn't it."
1,Pathetic,"I saw this when it came out originally, and has been a very, very long time since then. Not remembering, I purchased this after getting back into the ""Conan"" series; what a mistake! This was so lame I didn't even make it through the finish, turned it off. The production level is that of ""Ulyses""(sp?), back in the 50's, and the acting level is below rating. I'd put money on it that [Schwarzenegger] regrets this one....he is the best of it, and he's hampered. if you're into below ""B"" movies, this may be for you!"
1,A Catastrophic Flop,"Richard Fleisher directed this catastrophic flop of a movie as badly, if not in a worse manner, than its predecessor, 'Conan The Destroyer.' Avoid this film at all costs.The story follows the adventures of Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), the female version of Conan invented by the same writer, Robert E. Howard. To reclaim her fortunes, Sojna is accompanied by a barbarian warrior played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (Not Conan) and other characters.This is just another one of those bad Conan follow-ups that just had no grace or substance. A terrible screenplay with horrible dialogue. The action scenes are ridiclous and the sets horribly fake. Trust me, you won't miss a thing by not seeing this stupid film. The only good thing about this film is Ennio Morricone's (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; A Fist Full of Dollars, etc.) majestic score."
4,"With a name like Red Sonja, it HAS to be good!","Firstly, anyone who takes this movie seriously has got a whole lotta issues! I love this movie! I grew up watching Red Sonja and thinking she was the strongest, coolest super karate warrior swordswoman on the planet! There are moments when it seems as if the entire movie just sort says ""ok, that's all we got"" and shows the surrounding country for way too long, (which is why I gave it 4 stars) but it was the 80's, people! If you're reading this review right now you're about 20 years too late to think the ""special"" effects are anything less than ridiculous! In an attempt to be honest, however, it is not quite worth the retail value price.Pay less for it or you'll feel kinda stupid (Best Buy- 6 or 7 dollars!) but no matter what, if you want a cheesy movie to sit and make fun of, and you're in the mood for some serious sword-swinging chick fight action, this is it! Buy it- if nothing else, it'll add a little spice to your dvd collection!"
4,Fem,I've always enjoyed all the Conan movies. It is nice that there is one with a woman instead of a man as the hero.
5,good,i really love the movie it self so i was pleased i could actually get it on dvd in such good condition.
3,What do you expect??,"It is really odd that the releasing company responsible for this DVD saw fit to release it at all... it is so obscure and so, well, bad that I really wouldn't have thought it worth it. Anyway, now that it has been given a release, at least give it a rent. It certainly is one of most bizarre, misguided products of the eighties that I have ever seen, and is certainly as inept as anything else from that most unfortunate of decades.Nielsen's 'anachronistic'(?) mullet hairstyle is a scream (as is Bergman's face plate-thingy)- as a matter of fact, most of the 'artsy' touches in this film are worth a good chucle or two. Absolutely horrible : ) !"
2,Conan III ... well not really,"Apparently the producers originally were going to have Arnold portray Conan again but decided against it as they thought people would get the impression that he would be the main character and be disappointed with the film. Boy were they wrong! Even changing his name to Kalidor couldn't save the audiences from being disappointed. The producers first major fault was hiring director Richard Fleischer to direct as he graced us with the ultimatly disappointing Conan the Destroyer. He actually manages to make a worse movie with Red Sonja. The second major fault was hiring actress Brigitte Nielsen. Yes she had the build for a warrior women, but she was, and is, a terrible actress. I still enjoyed some of the picture in a B-movie way, but overall this was sorely disappointing even compared to Conan the Destroyer."
2,"By his own admission, Arnold's worst film","In fairness, it is only Schwarzenegger's presence which lifts this movie out of the 1-star category. There are some fairly good fight scenes, a few nifty sets, and some nice location filming. Other than that, however, it is a waste of time. There are numerous technical errors and other indications of slipshod production values. Nielsen's acting, if you are so generous as to call it that, is embarassingly bad. Sandahl Bergman, normally pretty competent, overcooks it completely as the evil queen. If you like this type of heroine, it would be preferable to spend your time watching Xena, which though far from high art, is much better than ""Red Sonja."""
2,Red Sonja review,"It's bad but not as as bad as Arlond's other films. The fight scences are pretty solid & the settings are stylish. The best actor is the kid who played the prince. Some scences & quotes look and sound like a porno like ""Only women may touch it"" and ""She wants you for herself"". It also has plotholes like ""Why did'nt the Wizard kill Red Sonja when she was near him?"" The worst part of the movie is the robot sea monster. Where did they make that thing? Radioshack? I give this film a 3 out of 10."
4,Brigitte and Arnold cut up,"You need to prepare you self for this movie; move the furniture out of the way and send the cats out of the room. Or they maybe victims of sword play.Yep you guessed it Arnie (Hercules in New York) is back and he is talking. Toss in Brigitte Nielson and a sprinkle of the evil Sandahl Bergman. And you have an afternoon of fun and revenge.Seems there is the talisman (some glowy plastic thing) that only women can touch. If it gets too much light it will destroy the world. It is captured by a dark queen with great ambition. Red Sonja, who hates men, must team up with Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to make sure the talisman is properly disposed of before it destroys the world. They have many trials and tribulations along the way. Will they succeed?"
4,"Ok for kids, adults... keep away.","I used to love this movie when I was a kid! Yes, the acting's dreadful, but it had a wonderful score by Ennio Morricone, good cinematography & larger than life sets. A classic story of Sword-and-Sorcery. Sanadahl Bergman is fun as the evil Queen Gedren."
2,A woman in her beauty is not enough,"I only rate this film 2 stars for the following: - films about fantasy ages are rare - Red Sonja is a knockout of a woman (hail Brigitte)This film has a very poor music score, bery bad conducted artists and poorly explored script. They tryed to make another Conan and ended up with a low level movie. Its entertaining sure, the landscapes are beautifull and the image is very good, but this film is poor. Arnold and Brigitte, you can do much better, you've done it already. I only advise this film to fantasy film fanatics like me, but only a child can't see the poor quality of this movie. Anyway I will sure buy it when I have a DVD because as I've said before, I like this type of movies and this one leaves me with that feeling that if the director had put more attention into it this could be a classic. Unfortunately it isn't."
3,Cheesey campy 80's classic,"Arnold.He is the reason this is watchable and without him this would be one of the worst movies ever.Nielson has the acting talent of a cherry tree but plays the role well physically. The biggest joke of a scene was Bridgette mourning her dead sister. A true Oscar worthy performance!And young Prince Tarn... ugh!!!He is the reason this movie is 3 stars and not 5.He is easily one of the most annoying characters to ever grace the silver screen and his servant, who has an IQ of a turnip, is almost as bad. His sidekick is not funny, overweight, and uses a giant bone for a weapon. Wow what a great mix!This movie is enjoyable, but only if you were a young male growing up in the 80's and for nostalgic purposes. Without Arnold this would be unwatchable."
3,Very poor indeed... but I quite enjoyed it really,"Seriously though, if I weren't a sucker for sword and sorcery films I wouldn't have lowered myself to this. In fact the main reason I did watch it was because George MacDonald Frasier who wrote the fantastic Flashman novels and the screenplay for Octopussy, did the script or screenplay or something for this too. Once I got into the film however, I found myself... well, rather enjoying it actually. I mean, what do you really expect from flms of this sort? Nielson was wooden but sexy and cool, Arnie was as rough and gruff (and tough) as you could want from a sword swinging barbarian, the evil queen was deliciously cliched, and as for the rest of the cast, well who really cares? I just wish the female audience could have been given another nice young male character to look at if Arnie wasn't quite to their tastes - and less of the fat annoying bodyguard, please!"
2,Before Sly Stallone ...,"A minor character in a Robert E. Howard historical story, Marvel turned it into a monthly character in the same world as Conan. Dino (""My Konk is big!"") De Laurentis brought it to the big screen with director Richard Fleischer, fresh off his failed CONAN THE DESTROYER. If anything, this bugger is even worse. Now I know that is saying alot. Arnold is in it as a character who is really SUPPOSED to be Conan and Brigitte Nielson in the title role. Sandahl Bergman (Valeria in CTB) is an evil queen in pursuit of a deadly orb of power and wiping out anyone in her path."
2,Sonja needs no help from any man---except maybe an acting teacher,This film is campy and awful that it rates up there with Showgirls for camp value. Brigette Nielsen is wooden as the fiery haired warrior who wants to avenge her slain family. Half the time I can barely understand her when she's not wielding her sword. Poor Arnold; this was a very lousy follow-up to the great Conan series.
3,Red Sonja,I looked everywhere for this movie and could not find it!So I was very happy to find it at Amazon.com.The imformation about the movie was listed that was helpfull because I was not sure what year it was made!I was also happy about the price of this product when I purchased it.Amazon is the best place to go for dvds.They have any movie you can think about!
5,Red Sonja,"Great movie, with great soundtrack, would of liked to of heard it remastered though. Hot chick, Arnie, whats not to like?!"
2,This movie has not aged very well at all!,"Unlike the Conan movies, this film is very cheesy watching in the year 2004. The customes are so dated it's hysterical. Arnold puts more drama and romance into his character than action and Brigette is well, very sexy, but not as strong as Conan the Destroyer and not even compariable to The barbarian.I liked this when I was 12 years old back in 1985, but being in my 30's now this movie brings back memories as to why did I like this movie in the first place!"
4,Historical romance and adventure in one...,"Red Sonja was an incredible movie(to me). I'm only thirteen, but I love it. I'm also a historical adventure fan, and I read and watch many things, but, as I said, I'm only thirteen. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,"Could be better, could be worse","Acting was eh, costumes were fun, villains chewed on the scenery. Obligatory annoying small child was annoying, though gradually became less so towards the end."
4,Red Sonja - 3985,Bought as A Christmas gift. Not my favorite type of movie but the family member who wanted it was very happy.
1,Blurry and Melted DVD,"I received Dio- We Rock DVD and when I tried to play it in a DVD player, it did not work. I tried it in different players and the same thing happened...then, I decided to look if it was scratched or something and to my surprise, the DVD disc looked like it was melted and all blurry! by the time that happened, it was too late to return it , wich is my fault but....when you think of it, I bought over $2,000 of cds at amazon in like 2 months and it just really sucks!anyway, be carefull and check your stuff to see if it works as soon as they arrive!Cheers,Chad"
2,DIO: we rock DVD,"The one song that I was able to play, was great, but I bought it from movie mars and amazon and both played the same so I sent it back and got a refund with no problem. I would recommend not buying, but then I'm not sure if it is a problem on my player. Might just be a bad set of discs in a production."
2,Typical poor quality DVD from Universal Studios,"Buyer beware, the menus DO NOT WORK, the interview WILL NOT PLAY and the disc skips alot...in other words typical Universal Qualiy. Concert film is o.k. bit dark and hard to see what is going on at times. Ronnie voice sounds gruff, like he will hupp and puff and blow your house down. But the non-functioning menus ruin this."
1,Save your money,"From the little of the DVD I was able to view these were GREAT Dio performances.The DVD itself is a major fail, I am on my second copy from amazon and both do not work as intended.The DVD play side has all sorts of cloudy spots through out the entire DVD.The menus do not work and will not take you to selected songs.When the DVD does decide to play at all there are long pauses and digital noise and break ups to be seen .I will continue to shop for a different manufacturer of this performance.What a shame to sell such a bad product of such a GREAT band.Dio Rocks"
1,We Rock- Dio,"this video would not play on any of the 3 computers or 5 dvd players that i tried to play it on. the disc itself had a decent size scratch and was covered in little spots of what looked liked wood stain. since it came from so far away, i never bothered with trying to return it... DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!!"
1,don't buy,the frucking dvd is all cloudy it didnt work on my ps3. why the Fruck do they even manufacture shlit like this that doesnt work. huge annoyance/waste of time. I'm sure the Dio preformances intended to be viewed are beyond superb as these are recordings from the 80's when he was in his prime. Looks like we're stuck with the newer performances on DVD were Dio sounds like a geezer unless you can find/afford the sacred heart dvd. dont risk buying this dvd. youll probably end up returning it. i should have listened to the other reviewers.
4,Funny stuff,"I read all the reviews and I have to laugh at the previous one who feels ""ripped off""... well, some of us don't have those original shows on VHS or laser disc or BETAMAX or whatever, so this is a inexpensive way to get some classic footage of 2 great concerts on one DVD instead of buying some bootleg off of EBay. It is what it is, and it's a good release, not excellent by today's standards, but decent and enjoyable. This was footage from over 20 years ago people... don't forget."
1,defective,"DO NOT BUY THIS. IT DOESNT WORK. AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, IT IS DEFECTIVE. THE RONNIE JAMES DIO'S WEBSITE AND THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE OFFICAL RONNIE JAMES DIO'S WEBSITE AND STATED THIS ""HAS NOT APPROVED THIS ITEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO AROUND TO AMAZON AND ANY COMPANY WHO PUT THIS ITEM AND ""THE DEFINITIVE DIO"" COLLECTION"" AND YANKS BOTH OF THESE ITEMS FROM ANY COMPANY THEY SEE PUTS BOTH OF THESE ITEMS OUT. AGAIN, THIS DVD IS DEFECTIVE."
2,Dont you know this book might not be worth buying?,"I personally don't like this book. Don't get me wrong, im a huge reader but when I had to read this book for a required project, I seemed to always be caught off and never really got into the book. I had to in fact look the book up because I couldn't remember simple things like the plot the author or even the main character's name... If you're into this book, sorry to disappoint. People, I recommend picking a book much more entertaining, like The Five People You Meet In Heaven. I enjoyed that much more than this."
4,Exciting,This book is so fun to read. It realy brings you closer to the story an helps you feel what others went through during those tough times
2,I Frankie dont like this book,"Don't You Know There's a War On? is about a boy who lives in Brookyn during World War II.The boy's name is Howie Crispers and his best friend is Denny.In the story the boys make a plan to save their teacher, Mrs.Gossim, from being fired.She is going to be fired because she is going to have a baby and they don't want a teacher being pregnant in school. I would give this book two stars because it is a very slow book and it takes forever for something good to happen.If you like books that are about school you might want to read this book.There were some funny parts in the book,but it was just a boring book overall.In the beginning, they talk about the war then it jumps only to saving Mrs.Gossim.I will never read this book again!"
2,why even read this book people?,This review i am writing to you all is because i read this book and i think that it is not a good book to read. but if you think you can read a good booko then dont read this book.
1,Do not read: Don't You Know There's A War On?,"Do not read this book. Everything was negative. Everyone was poor with no food or money, and couldn't afford a house. There was no food because it all went overseas to our troops in Germany. There was no transportation because they couldn't afford it.The book carried on and on about how great and nice their teacher was, the war, and where their dads were positioned. The whole book was a joke, and it was just so boring because it would just go on and on.The story just revolved around Ms. Gossim and the war. Like Ms. Gossim this Ms. Gossim that just because she was the nicest teacher and she was going to get fired. Then it goes on and on about war. They don't get through one day without talking about the war. Whoopdy-do I want some action! In conclusion, don't read this ""book"". It is negative, it carried on and on about stupid subjects, and everything was negative."
2,What is this?,"I have no idea what Wagram was trying to accomplish with this compilation...at its best, it is a distant shadow from the quality of the other six volumes. The songs in the first cd are lame and sound too holiday-ish....I had to check the CD player once the music was playing to verify I was indeed playing a SGDPC series CD.The second volume is equally lame and lacks the ""kick"" that has come to define the SGDPC series.Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,I preferred #8,"I bought #8 before this one and was a bit disappointed. I really liked the one I bought originally.When making a choice, go with #8!"
4,Amazing!,"This concealer really is amazing. I bought this mainly because I needed something waterproof and it is definitely dependable for that. I agree with the other reviews - a little goes a long way!! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it seems to seep out of the sides when closed...a lot has been wasted because of this problem. Otherwise, overall, it is a really good concealer! :)"
2,not worth the price,The first time I used this polisher the waxing foam broke in parts. Now for the next use I will need to order a new foam. I found a car wash that would do the same process with about 20$. I
4,"""Poker In The Rear"".","Though they're all good, this is probably his most popular, and best album. It rocks suprisingly hard, and I don't know of anything as good in the genre. The combo of ""Big Sky"" and ""Baddest Of The Bad"" is an excellent start. ""Five-O Ford"" and ""I Can't Surf"" are both pretty aggressive, while ""In Your Wildest Dreams"" is almost lounge-ish. There's also a good dose of humor running through alot of these songs, and mostly in the last track. The ""Reverend Horton Heat"" may be called rock-a-billy, but he's no ""Stray Cats"", unless you cross him with ""Ministry"" that is. ""Holy Roller"" is his ""Best Of"" by the way."
2,ponderous,Far too much musing about this and that....could barely finish the book. The girls school setting was too very squishy!
2,Early Work.,"Val McDermid is a much better writer now than when she penned this. I highly recommend the Tony Banks novels and some of the later ones. In this case, the murderer turns out to be the person you always suspected (rather like a reversal of Agatha Christie's books, when it always turns out to be the person you least suspected). The book also describes a lesbian affair in which the detective/journalist is frequently insulted by her lover, but hangs onto her anyway. Don't get that at all."
3,Not that great !!,I am so used to her writing about Tony Hill ...I found the Lindsay character a bit weak . I found it disappointing
2,A bit too Enid Blyton for me.,"Having read several of her later books I was looking forward to this one but was very disappointed.This could have been one of Enid Blytons Famous Five stories apart from the sexual orientation of a few characters and that they were knocking back whisky instead of lashings of ginger beer!Really would the headmistress of a private girls school ask a journalist to hang around after someone is murdered at the school - surely you would want the journalist as far away as possible. And allowing said journalist to question staff and pupils, particularly the pupils without a suitable adult present - sorry but too unbelievable for me.For those concerned about the lesbian aspects don't be to worried there are no detailed descriptions of bedroom antics.Had I read this book before any others I would have steered clear of Val MacDermid but really this is so different from her later books, too tame for me."
1,Print Studio ???,Software not very user friendly. I couldn't find things very easily. Wanted to make business cards. Went online to Avery instead
2,Fooled by the Label,"ICU has been known to produce some great trance albums, but this one was not their usual. After reading the cover of the CD and being fool to think it is progressive trance, i bought it. DON'T BE FOOLED. This cd exhibits nothing of a progressive trance album, instead it is dark and almost technoish... So if you're looking for Progressive Trance, this isn't the album for you."
4,little small but does the job,"I really like these bibbities. I bought some for a friend and then bought some for my 18 mos. daughter for xmas. We have been using them for several weeks. They are very easy to clean and to put on. My daughter has no objections to putting it on. The only drawback and reason they got 4 stars instead of 5, was that I wish it was a bit longer. The bib stops just above her belly which leaves it vulnerable to mess. Often when I take the bibbity off, she is clean except for the stripe between her bibbity and the high chair seat tray. That said, my daughter gives these things quite a test. She won't let me help feed her. As you can imagine at 18 mos. there is a lot of mess and I cannot expect any bib to stop it all. I'd buy them again."
5,Great invention,This bib is awesome! I love that I don't have to wash a load of bibs or wait for the backing to dry! This is the only bib we use. We have a ton less mess with this bib!
5,My daughter loves this CD!,My seven year old is quickly progressing at piano and is playing simple pieces of Bach. She had previously only appreciated Bach (with a Bach children's tape) but now is true to Mozart. Plays every morning on our way to school--what a way to start the day!
5,My favorite tea,"I got into various oolong teas from a great New York importer. They really know their teas!But this year, the Numi Ti Kuan Yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer. I dunno, maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing. But we've been enjoying this tea!You can spend 3 times as much and get better tea. But then it's too expensive to drink every day. Buy this!"
5,Excellent oolong tea from Numi.,"I have been drinking Iron Goddess of Mercy for years. Perhaps I can't get over how cool a name this tea has :)! However, I only would try Rishi brand and in a bind, I ended up buying Numi, and I love it. There is a slight difference in aroma and after taste between the 2 brands, and while I really still love Rishi, I love this one almost just as much and with some raw honey, it is a delicious drink to keep you going all day !!!"
1,Smells and tastes like turpentine,"I've had this variety of tea from other sources, so I have an idea what it should taste like. When I opened the bag, my nose was assaulted by a strong smell of turpentine - I thought it was the packaging, so I moved it into a plastic storage tub. The brewed tea tasted equally of turpentine. I did find that if you leave the tea out in the air, the taste and smell dissipates, but keeping it for any length of time in a closed container causes the turpentine taste/smell to return. Even aerated, the tea has a very grassy taste to it.Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will not buy a Numi tea again after this bad experience."
3,Tastes good but WAY too much caffeine for me,"I've heard about how good Oolong tea is for you and I heard this was a good brand so I tried it. It tastes fine -- not grassy like green tea and not bitter like some black teas -- but I was WAY to sensitive to the amount of caffeine in it. It kept me awake and buzzing for hours. If you are used to caffeine, it probably won't affect you too much, but if you're like me, you should get something decaffeinated."
1,Oolong tea?,"I love the taste of a good Oolong tea and I began to search for an alternate supply since our local grocery store stopped carrying loose Ti Kuan Yin Oolong tea. I decided to try this and it tasted nothing like the stuff that I was buying at Wegmans. This looks, smells, and tastes like green tea. The leaves used for making this tea are huge. When steeping them you'll be suprised to see the size. If I wanted a cheep green tea, I would have been happy with this. Needless to say I was not."
1,awful!,"I had high expectations upon purchasing this tea. I am sorely disappointed. The tea is practically raw green and not semi-fermented as oolong should be, tastes like grass (minus the gr), bitter, weak, pale yellow at best and not the promised copper color when prepared as per directions (or even stronger).Simply awful compared to other fine teas I have tried. Even Red Rose Decaf teabags taste spectacular compared to this stuff which tastes like straw at best.Total waste of money."
3,Good but weak tea,"Packaging suggests 1T for 10oz tea, which is high compared to most loose leaf teas, but the tea is still pretty weak at that concentration. It definitely doesn't have enough flavor for iced tea, which is my preference. Otherwise, packaging is nice, very little fines in the tea, and good price. Unfortunately not my cup of tea, so I will not buy it again."
4,Well-researched Book with Extensive Source-citing,"An exciting and spooky account of the werewolf-type creature that is alleged to be afoot in rural Wisconsin.As a reporter for a small weekly Wisconsin newspaper , the author of this book personally interviewed eye witnesses who described the Bray Road Beast as a bipedal, wolf-like creature with a huge chest, long claws and pointed ears.Godfrey also presents a list of historical sightings of a similar creature in Wisconsin dating back to the early 1930's, as well as an exploration of the similarities to the sightings of the ""dogman"" creature in neighboring Michigan.This is a well-researched book with extensive source-citing, a map of the major sightings and a chronology of events."
3,Werewolves of Wisconsin,"Not a scholarly tome by any means. The flow of the book is bumpy and the stye somewhat disjointed.Interesting as local color, not very hard hitting as a research work."
2,Not a reputable report,I was hoping to gain a little insight into the so called true story of the bray road beast. Instead the author jumps from story to story. Why is she writing about the dogman of Michigan? There is no reputable sources of proof of the Bray road beast. Nothing but bits and pieces of here-say. I was hoping for more but I cannot get my money back. I could write a fiction story and do better than this crap. Buyer beware !
3,Much ado about very little,"This is the type of book that irks me. Nifty name lurid cover that promises a whole lot more then it delivers. If you read the book, objectively, and strip away all the filler (most of the book is not about 'the beast') there is very little actual meat here. A bare handful of brief sightings of something that the people themselves tended to describe as a 'big dog'. And even those are usually second or third hand accounts of events that happened years ago. So much for 'the beast'.We then get a blow by blow account of 'almost' movies offers, dealing with the hyper TV shows (Sightings, In Search of etc) and considerable quoting from books by Brad Stieger and Loren Coleman.(Mr Coleman is a noted and respected researcher in the Cryptozoology field,by the way)Having said all that, Ms. Godfrey writes well, in a light and breezy way. The book is an easy read, a couple of hours at the most. Its just an average book for the general 'scary' reader."
5,Fantastic!,"I love this book. The whole prospect of a 'Man-Wolf' running around our forests is terrifying and apparently TRUE! Great read, great writer. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone who's interested in the paranormal and/or Cryptozoology."
3,"Not bad, but not particularly gripping","I give it 3 stars for being succinct and well organized.This book has got rhythm, and a dusty window into the life of most real writers. Also, I totally agree with the author about James N Frey's books on ""how to write damn good"" fiction. (don't buy them)Unfortunately, this author doesn't say anything that I didn't already know from reading author blogs. Also, this author's life stories are so so and downbeat.The book is a hybrid between an autobiography and an encyclopedia about publishing. Each chapter title is some publishing term, where the author tells us his experience with that aspect of publishing. Somehow, the authors little stories are not deep or informative enough to hold my interest."
5,Worth reading,"Doesn't tell you how to write, how boring would that be, tells you that your on the right track. Helps you to understand that what your probably doing is correct and regular, and that you can make it."
4,Ang in CA,This product went out within a month of using it but the seller promptly advised me he was sending a replacement. Makes so much more sense than to buy whole new unit.
1,replacement mist maker head,"I have had the product for just about a month, and it has stopped working already. I would not reccommend this product to anyone."
4,"Great cover pic, really good tunes!","I really like TJ's music and hadn't heard of this CD before. Just received it yesterday and I'm enjoying it. It's a bit different. A little 80's, funky, and the songs work well with his big voice."
4,early mick taylor,"Early underrated guitarist Mick Taylor pre Stones. Mr. Taylor is never given much credit for his greatness. He didn't show off or move much onstage. He never said much either, but his guitar does the talking. Some nice performances by Mayall like The Death Of JB Lenoir also."
2,WARNING: THIS IS NOT MERILEE RUSH,"and you certainly might be led to believe it is, since it says on the cover, ""17 ORIGINAL HITS."" Quite a hodge-podge of pop music, spanning the mid 50's to mid 70's. Now I'll have to buy Merilee's album...."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Cover cookie - NOT IN BOOK - NOR IS PRACTICALLY ANYTHING LIKE IT. Has some good 'cookie' recipes - however, bought it for state of the art style impressive decorating, as seen in upscale merchandise (like the cover picture) - also saw their 'cake' book - ALSO HAS GORGEOUS COVER - VERY LITTLE INSIDE ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS LOOK. I would say it borders on false advertising."
1,Sucks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I hate to say it but I bought this game thinking it would be fun a joy to play. But it flat out sucked. I mean in the beginning it was alright then later on it started to get boring and boring as I went along. Then some people do buy it for the creativity factors. But if you do buy this game buy a fresh memory card with it because for every monster you make it takes up I think it somewhere between 5-20 blocks (I traded it in for spider-man 2 and budokai 2). Don't buy it unless you have extreme patience and a decent allowance.
3,Quest game for kids,"I gave this game three stars because before you can even begin to go questing, you have to outfit and modify what appears to be a lizard/dragon helper and that's fairly time consuming. The game also starts slow, but gets better as you go on, playing through mini-game type challenges and talking to the characters you encounter. It's fun modifying and outfitting your own lizard/dragon helper with the items provided, though. It's good for kids, but not for anyone that plays Zelda-level quest games."
2,Of Low Quality,"Well, this game does have it's good points, but those are cancelled out by the negative. Plainly said, it is low quality. Of course, the prospect of drawing your own monster is simply a great, creative idea! But, the rest falls short. The mini-games I have to say are weak, as the rest.And did anyone else notice how the kid on the cover of the game isn't in the actual game?!?! (or at least as far as I've gone. I got bored easily.)"
3,Its a good game but.........,well amazing island is great for like the first 8 hours. then it starts to get a little boring. But its awesome when you first begin to play it.
1,Amazing Island? WHY AMAZING?,"THIS GAME SOUNDS NICE, BUT IT ISN'T! I got stuck on my second battle of a race! It sounded so awesome when I rented it! ""AMAZING ISLAND!"" Catching, eh? Just to suck people in to WASTE CASH! Don't listen to the other reviews! It's plain out horrible! The plot is bad, and the only good thing is making ugly monsters!"
3,Weak mystery-romance.,"Bedeviled was the weakest of the three vintage detectives I recently read, and the author is the most difficult to find on the Interwebs. I was able to find in old newspaper clippings that she was originally from Denver. She moved to Hollywood and several of her books (including this one-- Robert Taylor to star) were made into films. Otherwise, the record seems silent.Bedeviled is as much romance as mystery-- a talented young composer is stalked by the older predatory wife of a theater director, endangering his engagement and eventually his career and life. Predictable, and honestly a little bit annoying. The main character (his fiance) whines a great deal. Still, interesting as an artifact of its time."
2,"Disappointed, little dialogue on pages!","I was very disappointed in this book. I purchased it as an introduction of our Constitutional history for my 6 yr. old. It is little more than a picture book with one line of dialogue on each page. Dealing with a 6 yr. old who is always asking why and inquistive-normal for six yrs., this book could have expended thru out on the topic with more substance. Geared more for childrens in lower age of age catagory listed.Savanna"
2,Check his politics before buying.,"I am a third grade teacher, looking for teaching materials to help my students understand the power and importance of our Constitution as well as the incredible foresight and courage of our Founders. This book popped up in my search, and I have seen the author's work before. He is talented and creates beautiful illustrations. I read that he was a political cartoonist, so I thought I'd better check out his work before buying. When I looked at his political cartoons, I found many of them disparaging to the ideals I hold dear. I do not want to support this author and if you are a lover of country, you might not want to either. Please research him first."
5,Great teacher tool!!,This book was a great resource for Celebrate Freedom Week!! The kids enjoyed it and I enjoyed seeing them be able to understand such a difficult piece of American literature.
2,very partcular topic,"I found this book very good for just ONE particular type of Traffic and not very general as it could be deduced from the title. Very good for highways but nothing else, even is quite limited from the Complex System analysis. Very good if that is your main interest (freeways) but take care if you are interested in more complex situations of traffic with more constraints and boundary conditions, like traffic lights, crossing roads and so on."
5,A Must-Have for Every Shower Everywhere,After seeing these in 4-star hotels I'd stayed in I was really curious about them and decided to try and find where I could get one. Low and behold they were a steal right here on Amazon.com.I purchased one instantly and after the super easy installation I couldn't be happier. The additional space when you're in the shower makes a huge difference. It's affordable and well-worth it. I highly recommend one of these for anyone even remotely interested. You won't be sorry. Added bonus - they just look cool!
5,Great product!,"When combined with a hookless shower curtain, this really modernized my bathroom. I have much more room in the shower & it's nice to be able to see out. Easy to install & the curtain glides across the bar!"
5,Whatta lotta elbow room!,"Recently, I drove across the USA and stayed in Paxton, NE at a hotel with the ARC shower rod installed. Being a 6'2"" guy, most conventional showers are hurting for elbow room for me. Not the case with the ARC rod. The product impressed me enough to place an order here to get the rod at the best price, too. Very innovative and an unexpected surprise to discover this product in a cross country drive."
5,Quality Product,"The Arc Shower Bar is a sleek, contemporary design that is easy to install. I chose the brushed stainless steel finish which coordinates with other fixtures in our bathroom. The manufacturer supplied two different type wall anchors plus toggle bolts are included for various type of wall materials (i.e drywall, ceramic tile, etc.). One end of the rod can be cut off if needed to customize the arc desired.I also purchased a ""Hookless Shower Curtain"" which is of excellent quality and moves effortlessly on the Arc Shower Bar. The curtain came with a liner that snaps in and out. I did break one of the plastic snaps trying to unhook the liner, but hopefully the company will send a replacement. I will definitely purchase these products again for a second bathroom and would recommend these products to anyone looking to update the look and functionality of their shower."
5,This has spoiled my husband.,"He doesn't like to shower in the 'regular' shower anymore - feels cramped! This rod not only gives more room in the shower, but makes the tub area look elegant. I'm so glad we took the chance on this."
3,The Arc Shower System,I replaced shower doors in a corner shower with the Arc System. This system gives my wife and I more room to get in and out and in the shower. I used the hookless shower curtains that go with this system. One downside is the limited selection of outer curtains
4,arc rod,"I could not use this arc rod since it would not fit for the nonstandard shower opening I have. It is an attractive rod, and would suit a standard opening quite well, and offers an unique design instead of the typical round rods.Since it is not adjustable, the opening must suit the size."
5,Makes the shower a nicer place,"Neither my wife nor I are large, but this product still makes the shower area nicer.We first experienced an ARC at a hotel in Columbus and my wife commented at the time that she liked it.I gave her one as a Christmas gift and though she wasn't thrilled at the time, after it was installed and she had used it again for a couple weeks she admitted that it was a worthwhile effort."
5,Love it!,I saw these while staying at numerous hotels and knew I needed one! This was very easy to install and seems pretty sturdy. The only thing to take into consideration is your shower curtain. We have a standard sized one and it is very close to not being long enough now that it bows out.
5,Just as amazing as you'd think,"Yep, like everyone else is saying: SUPER easy install - comes with anchors for your drywall. And I can't see any reason you'd ever need to trim the rod. One of our bathrooms that we installed an Arc in is SUPER small, AND the door opens in. So I just backed the mounts into the shower 6 inches or so, and it works great! The extra elbow room is such a stupid thing when you say it outloud, but then when you get in the shower, it's SOOOO nice! Anyway, a must buy! Quick & easy install with superb results."
3,Written for High School Students,"When I saw the title for this book I was interested because I've felt that my own life has been unconventional. But, I was disappointed because what this book should have been called is: Advice to High School Students. The whole book is written around what advice Marion Winik gives to her high school class during a reunion. That is fine if you happen to be 18 years old and have no experience in the world yet - and the book is useful in that regard, but I'm 37 and most the advice she gives is basic stuff. My problem with this book is that the title is simply misleading, nowhere does it explain on the book or its cover that it is written for high school age people - you don't learn that until you've already made the purchase."
1,ingredients not disclosed,"If I had known that this product contained soy lectin as an ingredient, I would not have purchaed it. If you're trying to avoid soy in your diet, then don't buy this product."
3,some cans were dented,"some of the cans were dented and from the pressure the lids were removed...the product wasn't wrapped good for dilivery...i use this milk for my one year old child, which i cannot find in near by stores"
4,Not bad for powdered milk!,"First of all, let me say that I consider myself a milk connoisseur. I can easily tell the difference between skim, 2%, and whole milk. I can even detect when that gallon of milk has been sitting in the gas mart fridge just a little too long.As far as this product goes, this tastes kind of like milk. But what it does taste like, ain't bad. I would describe it as somewhere between whole milk and fresh buttermilk. In a pinch it works and is very tasty as well."
4,Good product and was ideal for me as dry Whole Milk is very difficult to come by..,Ideal product as dry Whole Milk is fifficult to find. mixing dry milk with little warm or room temperature water will allow milk to reconstitute much easier then let cool before placing milk in refrigerator.
1,Not what is shown in the picture!,What is shown in the picture is a 900g can of Nido. What you actually get is a 360g can. Deceptive.Note that this is a review of the product as depicted. Nido as a dried milk is quite good.
5,glad to be able to buy online,"fast shipping and this is hard to find in my grocery store, so this makes it convenant to buy online. Thanks so much!"
2,Soy flavor,"Been trying out different brands of powdered, canned, uht milk lately. I gave this one a try and it is my least favorite. I can taste what seems to me like a Soy milk(which I couldn't stomach).ALSO the prices I've seen online are total ripoffs, $3.50 or so at walmart in Mexican isle."
5,"If You're serious about God, read this book!","While enlightening for everyone, this book is practically a ""how-to"" manual for people looking to deepen their spiritual walk. If you've read Watchman Nee, where one has to stop reading periodically to let the truths sink in, you will feel right at home when reading Andrew Murray's treatise on the Holy Spirit.The author does not emphasize the spiritual gifts of the Spirit, neither does he deny them. The gifts are simply not the area of his concern here. He wants to help the reader achieve in his own life and experience the overcoming life the Lord Jesus promised. In my opinion, he succeeded admirably."
2,Very Small.,"I ordered X Large. I expected the shirt to be very loose. This wasn't a standard extra large. It's more like a medium. I did not intend to purchase a form-fitting top. If the sizing on the shirts was accurate I would not have purchased the shirt in this size. Also, the color is a bit lighter than the picture."
4,A peephole into Irish life.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Rosemary Mahoney writes about the life of the Irish contrasting the city life of Dublin to the country life in Corofin. Although, the book is titled ""the private lives of Irish women"", she spends a great deal of time writing about the men of Corofin. Through her experiences with the local men, the reader gets insight into how women are perceived and treated in Ireland. It gave me deeper insight into the issues of abortion, divorce, homosexuality and the Catholic church's rule within Ireland. If you're interested in a realistic look into Ireland, check this book out."
1,"Silly book, would not recommend","Silly book. Writer has no sense of the Irish. Irish humour is very different to american and which writer has totally missed. No wonder her experience was so negative. Oh well!!!!!Whoredome, Irish women -is she tryihg to be funny??? who knows.I couldn't finish the book and the book was not a book I would share with anyone so into the bin it went."
4,Simply Brilliant Piece of History,"Had this on vinyl more years ago than I care to admit and was real happy to find it on CD. Maybe a bit dated these days, but still a brilliant demonstration of musicianship, vocal harmonisation and how to have a 4 man band with 4 front men.If you're into 3 Dog Night, CSNY, The Byrds - that sort of vocal intricacy, but with much better (and heavier) musicianship - guitars, drums etc, then this is for you."
2,Poor Quality,I was greatly disappointed when I began watching these movies. The picture quality was that of an old VHS and changed into dvd quality as the movies played. Rarely did I see anything close to blu-ray quality picture.
3,You must read Awaken Healing Energy Through the Tao as well.,"I have reviewed three books by Mantak Chia:* Awaken Healing Energy Through the Tao.* Taoist Secrets of Love.* Taoist Ways to Transform Stress into Vitality.Only the first of these safely describes the central MICROCOSMIC ORBIT, stating that the energy must be collected at the navel after exercising. Read that book!"
5,Mantak Chia is Highly recommended!,"This book rocks! Anything to turn stress into vitality is a blessing! Smiling down on your organs is such a lovely way to go about taking care of your insides. This book flows through the seasons with a particular organ, sound, color, feeling for each season. I highly recommend this book for all, even homeschooling famlies doing a unit on the body and/or the seasons."
4,The Best,"I love the work out as soon as I started. I have had it for a week now and I do the workout every morning, I really feel good about myself when I'm done. I would recommend this DVD to someone. I really do see results In my body my arms & legs. I say buy it!!!! I will be buying more of Kelly Coffey DVD's."
4,Like being in class at the gym,"Another workout I use often because it's like being at the health club I once belonged to. Requires hand weights, maybe a step to sit or lay on. Not a lot of mindless chatter, just helpful tips."
5,Workout DVD,Great workout dvd. Challenging and great cueing. I feel challenged and thoroughly spent when the disc is finished. Should be great for all levels; just increase the weights.
5,Strong family values.,"This book is a life learner, it teaches challenges and is highly impressive with dialogue. The lion king has become a favorite read amongst both children and adults, it is highly recommended by parents to be presented to their children."
3,Well written descriptions -- NO CREDIT for writer(s),"Why couldn't Disney at least name the writer, or writers, who wrote the descriptions of the movie scenes for the book? The prose is good. SOMEONE deserves credit. Disney is stingy. And mean. And the movie glorifies monarchy. Mufasa is a benevolent dictator. (Always benevolent? We don't know.) Simba will be his unelected successor-king. No room for democracy in Disney's Pride Land? Oops, I've misplaced my sense of humor! Darn that Disney."
5,Nice Illustration,I purchased this book and the movie DVD together and this book's illustrations are right out of the movie. My 1.5yr old son loves to look at the pictures in the book.
3,"Bad plot, but good drawings concerning the movie.","Although this book has really bad plot, it is a very educative book, expecially for the young. It teaches about respect, and correcting ones wrongs. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys good character"
3,The Lion King,"A Joyous day dawned in the Pride Lands. A lion prince had been born! The animals gathered at Pride Rock to celebrate the Circle of Life.They bowed low as the wise babon Rafiki held Simba high. King Mufasa and Sarab watched their cub prodly.But one animal was missing from the craud. Scar,Mufasa's brother, did not want to see his new nephew. ""It must have slipped my mind,""scar told Mufasa. scar had hoped to become King when Mufasa's rule ended. Now he knew that Simba would become the next Lion King.To try toget him out of the way. Scar set a trap for young Simba and his friend Nala. He tricked them into exploring on elephant graveyard. to make sure that Simba didn't come back, scar sent three hungry hyens to meet him.Mufasa resued the young cubs. He did not know about scar's tric. He only knew that he was disappointed in his son for talking foolish chances scar was upset for a different resson: simba was still alive scar led Simba to a deep canyon and starter a stampede to crush him."
1,Frustrated Gaming Experience Thanks to Incompetent Guidebook,"I have to agree with the first review, this book is ATROCIOUS and not worth your money. It is so incredibly frustrating to play 30+ hours and re-start the whole game, just because the guidebook did not provide clear concise instructions on how to recruit this guy, when gamefaqs.com shows that you can recruit him earlier. And worse, there are NO maps, what the **? It is a waste of money. Guidebooks are supposed to help gamers get the best ending, best gears and directions so that we don't have to waste time wandering around in dungeons and world maps!! Take it from me, go gamefaqs.com and don't buy this junk!"
1,A frustrating experience,"If you value your time and money simply refrain from buying this book. It doesn't contain a single map and the most important part - recruiting all 108 characters - is inaccurate and sometimes even wrong. If you were hoping to find detailed locations of all treasure chests and the shortest way through the various dungeons, you better draw your own map instead of relying on this useless waste of paper. Compairing this guide with other sources - even amateur walkthroughs on the net - I came to realise, that this book is not worth the paper that it has been printed on.Following this guide step by step will eventually lead to completion of the game, but you will miss out on recruiting more than ten characters."
2,Not bad...but not as petite as you would think.,"I bought this for some chick I was seeing, I thought it would be a nice little necklace, it turned out to be larger than I thought. In case you date Sasquach stay away."
5,Awesome Book,"Robert Cantrell does a great job in his illustrations. This will be a hard book to read, but you must read it again and again to understand the spirit in which Sun Tzu and Cantrell speak."
3,Short and sweet,"This book covered less of the history relating to Sun Tzu than I expected it to. It is a very short book, with only limited examples. If you are trying to seriously study sun tzu then I would recommend another copy,"
2,What? No photos?,The absurdity of doing a book about how to be a sushi snob and then not having ONE SINGLE photo in the book makes this utterly laughable. Ya know - the old - SHOW don't TELL thing. Totally irrelevant because of this.
1,Toiltet Paper,"I checked this book out from the library to see if it was worth buying. Thankfully that's what I did. This book isn't even worth a Fodor's backcover. Totally, Totally worthless. If you like droning verbage buy the book. If you want to learn about Sushi or how to make it move on down the road. In all the years with Amazon this is the first time I have ever given a review less than 3 stars and even that was rare until now. This book is good for carrying in your backpack into the mountains if you need emergency wipe your lower backside paper. Save your money!"
4,The man.,I just love all of Danny Rivera's music. So naturally I am going to recommend it. When it comes to slow jams this is the music and the man you want to relax and hear
2,Demasiado básico,"Me parece que el contenido del libro es demasiado básico. Las ideas que se plantean allí son solamente tres y trabaja alrededor de ellas en demasía. Hace mucha publicidad a empresas del sector financiero, y de hecho muchas páginas del libro son utilizadas para esto. Para las personas que vivimos en el extranjero (fuera de Estados Unidos) tiene mucho contenido que no aplica; tanto para el tema del retiro como para las inversiones.No me parece recomendable ni para personas que comienzan a organizar sus finanzas personales."
5,Exelente,Tremendo libro para organizar tu salud finaciera. El te explica paso por paso como organizarte economicamente. Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. !Yo he regalado a mis amistades 3 libros!
4,good deal,"product was best priced, received in no time, it was a gift and the person receiving the product has no problems with it"
5,great read ....easy to finish in a couple days,"This is a great book exemplifying the way that God can CHANGE lives like we'd never imagine! Dr. Sam Huddleston spoke at my church in Livermore, CA several years ago and I purchased the sermon on CD. His wisdom and word usage makes it easy to listen to/read his message. I definitely recommend this book"
5,me like,"This is a great album. I'm not going to write a full review, but I bought this knowing only one song (Wurlitzer), and now I like all the other tracks. Yeah, it doesn't break new ground, but that's okay with me. Good music doesn't need to be much more than that. It's downtempo, doing it's thing, and that's just fine."
2,oddly confusing,"This movie was just another version of TLA's way of luring in gay people with a sexual cover to another droll movie, but this time it really made no sense!! The plot, if there was one, was very hard to comprehend. Three brothers each trapped in their own vices, but you never get to fully explore any of their lives to realate or sympathize for them. A miss for me!!"
2,Pretty weak,"Many times in online forums for film reviews, I read reviews with which I don't agree but I can still often find in the film the elements to which reviewers responded either positively or negatively. The reviews on this film, however, almost seem to me to be talking about a different film. This film is poorly paced, acted, lit, cast . . . There are certainly some beautiful images but they aren't shot particularly well. I had a lot of hope for this one as a film exhibiting the passionate (non-sexual) male bonding mentioned by reviewers here on Amazon and found none of it. As you read this, however, bear in mind that negative assessments of this film, here and elsewhere online are rare. Those of us who did not like it are in the minority."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"i have a feeling this was a really good movie. borders and amazon need to state the fact CLEARLY when a movie is in a foreign language. this movie was in french. now i have no problem in the movie houses reading english at the bottom but in this case, it was rough. i have no clue what the story line was about since i was so busy reading the english. if a story is in a language other than english, all it would take is that fact. FRENCH w/ENGLISH SUBTITLES WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT, but no one does that. i also would like to contact a human at borders but evidently they are just too busy to talk with a customer. i have about 400 movies, most of them from borders/amazon so i consider myself a good customer. all i ask is a ""contact us button"" but evidently no chance of that. i don't suppose this will reach the review site because of all this but what does one do except just quitting of ordering all these movies from a company that just doesn't care about the buyers.gary in az."
2,Gross dead body descriptions,"I was surprised when my fifth grade girl came home and said that this book was being read out loud in class. Her descriptions of the dead bodies with the flies and bodies ripped open, as well as the boy vomiting because of the severity of the scene, was disturbing to me. I have never let my children even watch PG 13 movies until they were actually thirteen. It seems that our society is making our children so desensitized to violence, that most fifth grader don't even blink an eye about something about this. With books like this being recommended in elementary school, I guess I shouldn't be surprised by how callous many of the high school students that I work with seem to be."
1,WARNING,"There was nothing wrong with the book until the ending. Very dissapointing to find that the story, which was good, ended terribly. I wish I had been warned before I had my son read this book.For those that don't like detail of a bear attack on two humans, like myself, this is not a book for you. I was appalled at the ending which I found horrible.The idea of the book was good, he's in the wilderness, he finds a dog... Great, now he has to come upon two mauled humans? Come on. Paulsen, you failed with this one. When you said you wrote the last Brian book, you should have kept to your word. Very gruesome and not for children.I really wish that I had been warned, if I had, this would not be the book he read."
4,son loved it,I have an 11 yr old son who loved this book. The material seems to be just perfect for his age group and many of his friends like this author as well.
5,Very good reading,A dramatic outdoor adventure that leaves the adventure minded reader ready to tackle the out of doors. try the book and se if it challenges your imagination.
4,The Hunt,"Have you ever wanted to do something but you're too young? Brian's Hunt is about a fourteen year old boy who wants to hunt but he's too young. So he pretends too be a lot older. He chooses to take the hard rough life in the wild wilderness with his friends Randle and Mike. My favorite part is when he got attacked by a bear, but Randle and Mike saved him. I give it four and a half stars. I would say that anyone who likes adventure would like this book."
4,Brian's Hunt review by Mac,I liked this book because it had adventure and also mystery. The book had a good way to keep you reading because it won't clue you to what is going to happen next. I think this would be a good book to read for a teen. I did not give this book a 5 because at some parts it does get boring.
3,Brian's Hunt,"Brian goes back out into the woods. He finds a dog injured and nurses it back to health. He finds out that a bear is what hurt the dog. Brian rows to a camp where his friends stay at sometimes in his canoe. He finds the two dead bodies of a man and woman that he knows. Later, Brian finds a girl that he knows. After these people in a helicopter come and pick up the girl, Brian goes out and hunts the bear that also killed the man and woman. The story is slow throughout almost the entire book. Some parts were exiting like when Brian finds the two dead bodies and when Brian fights the bear at the end."
5,Brian's Hunt,"With Brian's knowledge from the last time, he made weapons, started to explore the south more, and he is now starting to hunt in movement. When Brian was asleep a dog woke him up and Brian found out there is a very large wound on the dog. He thinks some thing bite the dog. Then he made afire to see the wound. Then Brian went to get fishing line. Then he sowed the flesh together, so it can heal the wound. Then Brian and the dog hunts a....... I would like to tell you the rest of the stores, but I want you to read the book. I like this book because it was about nature and hunting things. I would recommend it to some one that like hunting and nature."
3,Brian's Hunt Review,"I have read this book in a book club in class. The book was very interesting and kept my attention. It had many suspenseful moments. I did find it a little gory and the scenes were a little detailed for me. Overall, it was a good book though."
4,Hunting more of Brian,"My 17 yr old son and i were at the library and he went looking for the other Brian books... he is not interested in too much in life other then girls; so this, to me, says a lot about the book!"
5,A 4th Grade Student Review,"I gave this book 5 stars because it had alot of adventure. If you are like me it's hard to find a book that you really like, but like Gary Paulsen's books he makes them really intense. The mood in the story is thrilling and scary. Gary keeps me reading by having great word chioce. My favorite kind of books are the kind that don't label the chapters that makes me want to keep on reading. ~ peterson"
5,Brian's Hunt,"My fifth-grade students love this series. I've used Gary Paulsen's ""Hatchet"" series to hook boys into reading. They love the outdoor adventure genre, and can't stop reading once they've started!"
5,Brian's Hunt,Through Gary Paulsen's series about Brian I have a student who now wants to read for the sheer pleasure of reading. I started him on Hatchet and he is now in Brian's Hunt. He says that each book is better than the last.
4,Brain's Hunt,"I read the book Brian's Hunt. It is a book continued from Gary Paulsen's book Hatchet. I like this book because of how the author describes things in the book. Also he is my favorite author. For example, when Brian does something Gary Paulsen will describe it very well in the next sentence. That is why I like this book."
4,Brian's Hunt by Alex,Over all this was a good book. I thought that it was a fascinating story. He got back from the bush and he decided that he didnt like the noisy city so he went on a trip. He went to the Canadian wilderness. He was hunting moose. He had the perfect shot but he decided not to take the shot. He figured that it was to easy to shoot it at such a close range. He was floating down the river in a canoe. He was almost unnoticed he looked like a piece of deadwood that washed up on the beach and somehow floated downstream.
3,Brians Hunt,"The book Brians hunt is what I would call a typical Gary Paulsen book. It has a very entraping and interesting begining that explains the main characters position. It also explanes how brian has come to love the wilderness more than his own civilisation. In this book brian returns to the wilderness with a canoe, and his ever trusty bow. Brian still with his original mind set he is instilled with in HATCHET. Through out the book Brian is taunted by the thought of the perfect kill. Come and see if he will get his chance. And comeread a great book."
4,Brians Hunt,It was a good book. I liked how he goes to live in the wild. I liked the way he helps the dog by stitching up her wound.Now he lives with her.Ka-wana-dush's cabin and he has to go in his canoewith the dog to get there. I think it is almost as good a hatchet.
4,Brian's hunt,This book was ok. It was about a boy in the wilderness. He camps and hunts in the forest. He also does a lot of fishing. He does a lot of hiking and packes light for camping. I learned a few things about camping while reading this book. I recommend this book to someone that likes the outdoors and camping.joey f.
5,Spindle Sander,Purchased a Jet 5.5 inch 1/2 HP benchtop oscillating spindle sander with additional spindle assortment from Amazon.com and item arrived in excellent time and in great condition. Unpacked and installed the supplied spindle and went to work. The table top is cast and large enough to handle most sanding jobs. The motor is wisper quiet and powerful enough to do the things that I will be doing. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend.
1,Poor packaging,"I give this item a single star, as I never had a chance to try it. The sander appears to be a well made and heavy (for a bench top tool) machine, however, the packaging falls far short. The sander, when it arrived, had the base damaged. There is sufficient styrofoam packing around the sides of the machine, but the top and bottom have about 1/2"" thickness of foam protection. In shipment, the box had been dropped and the base is deformed to the extent it does not sit flat.The sander will be returned and I will not risk delivery of another Jet sander.As an aside, if anyone considers the purchase of this tool, be advised that with the height of the basic machine, if your bench is, say 30 inches from the floor, then the cast iron table of the sander will be about 52"" from the floor! You may need to make a special base cabinet to get the table at a more workable height."
3,Good Sander For The Money,"I just received my Jet benchtop sander along with my Jet 16 1/2 drill press last week from Tool Crib. Overall, I think Jet's 1/2 hp sander is pretty good. Set-up was easy and the overall fit and finish was good.My table top seemed to be mounted on a little crooked. There's no way to adjust for that I guess. I didn't have a problem getting the table square with the spidle though...the most important thing of all. I wish the table was a little bigger, too.Overall, it's a nice package if you don't want to spend twice as much and don't wan't the heavier floor model. I was going to but the $X BOSS spindle sander, but it's only 1/4 HP and can bog down pretty quickly. The Jet is definitely worth the extra $X."
2,Crafty Hands,"Musicianship is top notch, production is kind of sterile, compositions are not overly memorable. Give it a try if you can find it cheap, but it's far from essential listening."
4,"You'll Probably Need a Book on the English, Too","This is a very good book; I agree with the other reviewers, but be warned that if you are a serious player you'll probably want to invest in a book on the English opening as well. The author himself admits this. This is because 1 Nf3 can transpose into an English, and this is beyond the scope of the book, which is essentially a book on the Reti.It can be kind of frustrating to learn all the concepts in the book, and the various black defenses, only to face an uncooperative opponent, who plays a defense not covered in the book! I've had that happen a lot. Of course it will happen no matter which opening you decide to play!All in all, I think playing 1 Nf3 makes sense. It's a strong move, even played by Grandmasters, and does tend to limit Black's choice of response (as commpared to 1 e4 or 1 d4 or even 1 c4). This book is a good way to familiarize yourself with 1 Nf3 d5 and related lines."
4,Delicate Swing,"Johnny O'Neal is a rare talent that's little known. A beautiful touch that captures a feeling of individuality, and yet imbodies characteristics of some of our greatest pianist. ""Soulful Swing"" has many diverse moods. Tracks 1&3 portray a more gentle feeling, characteristic of McCoy Tyner. Track #2 gives off an Oscar Peterson quality. Then there is track #6 Ain't Misbehaven, which sounds just like the late great master of swing, Gene Harris. A masterful touch, such as Mr O'Neal's should not remain a secret. Great support from the terrific bassist, Dave Young..."
5,anime fan,If you love women who can kick butt this is the anime for you this ova was one of my favorites and my vhs is wearing out this great addtion to anime collection
5,"120 MINUTES OF ANIME ACTION, COMEDY AND BIG JUGS.","This movie is really good, it is about 3 beutiful female cops (with BIG jugs) who have been given the mission to stop a gang of terorists. Watch all the action comedy and jiggly jugs on burn up warrior."
3,Skin Dive,"Although this movie is an action movie, it really seems to be more of a comedy. The action scenes seem to be less than delivering and action fans will probably be disappointed. Although other more sadistic fans may enjoy the tid-bits of nudity here and there and the female exploitation. I think this movie's comedy is much more effective than the action segments. Of course, the animation is quite nice as well."
5,Love. The sounds from ones heart. Divinity!,Natacha has a beautiful voice. Her every word rings a bell that can be felt in the deepest sea. Words simply cannot express the divinity that is Natacha Atlas's voice. A precious jewel amongst the sand.
5,Fantastic!,I've heard it the 1st time during my belly dance classes. Apart using in my practices I like to listen it when lying in my couch and day-dreaming on her beautiful voice.
2,Simply not a good Middle Eastern CD.,"I'm a fan of both contemporary and traditional Middle Eastern music, and have found this CD to be disappointing on both fronts. It feels muddled and lacks soul. The ""folkloric"" passages sound forced, and Natacha Atlas' voice can be downright irritating. If you're looking for good Middle Eastern music, this disc is not for you."
1,What a disaster,"I was looking for another rabbit book on how to train rabbits and looked at the 'Search Inside This Book'. Having read the first few pages of the book I was so disgusted I decided to write my first ever review. Don't go anywhere near this book - any book which says that rabbits can be left for a long weekend without anyone caring for them is a disgrace. Rabbits need fresh food and water twice a day and entirely healthy rabbits can die within 24 hours if disaster strikes. This is especially the case during warm weather when flystrike is a danger. Disgusting book, I can't believe it was published!"
3,A Good Backup Resource,"HOP TO IT is a compact book on rabbit care written by a woman who obviously and unashamedly loves rabbits. Much of the information in the book is based on her experiences with rabbits as pets and it does have some helpful information based on lessons she has learned the hard way. Her stories about her own pet rabbits as well as the rabbits of friends are helpful, and in some cases amusing. It has helped me understated some rabbit quirks which is, of course, important. I would not recommend this book as a primary care manual for rabbits, but rather as a supplement to a book such as WHY DOES MY RABBIT? by Anne McBride or THE HOUSE RABBIT HANDBOOK, both of which are chock full of helpful information and seem to have veterinary expertise."
1,Subjective and inconsistent rabbit-training tips.,"Dangerous and misleading notions abound in Ms. Hunter's Hop to It, including: bunnies can never get electrocuted when they chew electrical wires (they can), and bunnies should be fasted before surgery (they shouldn't).There is, however, some good, basic (stress: basic) advice contained in this small tome, which is surprising, as it seems most of the info is gleaned from her own experience WITH ONLY ONE RABBIT. Therefore, this predominately anecdotal book serves more as a photo-journal of the author and her own rabbit, than a comprehensive, authoratative, and objective training guide about rabbits in general.Stick with the superior House Rabbit Handbook, by Marinell Harriman, instead."
1,"Decent for a magazine article, bad for a book","I think the information in this book would have been better presented in a magazine article. It was more of a cute story of Life With Woodstock, rather than a guide to training. As a new owner of two bunnies, and no experience, I looked forward to learning how I could train my bunnies. Instead of tried and true methods used in many circumstances for many bunnies this book is just one person's experience with one bunny. As noted in another review. some information is misleading or wrong. The only helpful hint I gleaned from this book was to make commands be one or two words. I am still looking for a good training book. Sorry I wasted the money on this one."
2,Hop to It,"This book was written in 1991. Much of the very important information regarding nutrition, health concerns and treatments and how to appropriately pick up a rabbit is out of date. Nutrition section is especially alarming. Some sections, such as traveling and working with an aggressive bunny are good.Overall, I would recommend a more recent rabbit care manual."
1,Misinformation from a beginner rabbit owner,"As many other reviewers have said, this book has a lot of misinformation. This should not be labelled as a guide for training rabbits. I have owner rabbits for many years. Pellets should not be the staple diet, wire bottom cages are not good for them, cords CAN kill rabbits (I lost one rabbit this way, from electrocution), and the handling just does not fit all rabbits. Scruffing a larger rabbit is a horrible idea. Also, untrained rabbits are not dumb, they are locked up and terrified. They exhibit personality when allowed freedom, movement and playtime interaction.Please view this book as one beginner's experience with making some mistakes, and not as a guide for new owners."
2,At Last! A True Cure for Chronic Insomnia,"Hoping to capitalize on his fame as a yachtsman and on his notoriety in connection with the 1982 Falklands War, Mr. Southby-Tailyour launched this publication prematurely, and without a proper design.It's part sketchbook, part journal, and mostly an excruciatingly detailed, incredibly boring set of sailing directions on the order of, ""Go five cables west and three chains south past the third gray rock to . . . ."" It's a great bed book for those who aren't served by counting sheep, warm milk, or melatonin. If you are curious, borrow it from a local library, but don't invest any money in it."
2,Product Needs More Information/Detail,"This product is too small for the IPod Nano ""5th Generation"". 5th Generation is longer than the previous versions. I didn't see any information about which Nano it fit on the product information (maybe I missed it)."
5,Excellent Book on Activity-Based Pricing,"John Daly came up with a well written book that is interesting and informative on activity-based pricing. This book complements my knowledge and expertise on activity-based costing and I now know how to develop my prices based on a disciplined methodology for fixing the price.John Daly avoids the mistake of focusing of maximizing revenue, advocated by some marketing professionals but rather puts the focus where it belongs namely maximizing profitability and ultimately shareholder value.Any manager with responsibility for pricing will benefit immensely from reading this book."
1,Possibly Even Drier Than Moroney's Performance,"It would be difficult to imagine a performance of Bach's French Suites drier and duller than that given by Davitt Boroney, but Jarrett might just have managed to do so. This is reverent, ""hands off"" Bach, just as your grandfathers liked it, not pithy, interpreted Bach. Jarrett never suffers a single articulation, his harpsichord is lifeless, his sense of rhythm and tempo is absolutely dead and metronomic. In short, he plays classical music as badly as those classical musicians who make occasional forays into playing jazz, and with the same predictably hideous results."
4,Awesome for the money,"Length:: 0:45 MinsWorks almost perfect. Great deal for 30 bucks. Some static and sometimes a high pitch noise, but you'll have to pay a lot more to get something better."
1,This things a Joke! Don't buy.,"I wished I hadn't wasted my money buying this. I used to have a nice radio transmitter for my mp3 player where it was like a dial on the radio and when the station came in, it was in nice. I lost that one. So I bought this, but this, you have to go through clicking on ALL the stations before getting a signal and even THEN, it's staticy. Any station that my songs would play--they would all turn out staticy!Forget this piece of TRASH and maybe pick up some speakers, that's what I did."
5,Lightning: Fire From The Sky,"This film is very good for effects from natural disasters, (lightning storms in this film) to the relationship between a father and his son. I am a big fan of John Schneider way back to his Dukes of Hazzard days, and recently brought Night Of The Twisters another natural disaster film starring John so I could not wait to get this release to. It is amazing that lightning storms like this could happen though hopefully not, and the destruction that can occur from it. The film was made in 2000 and even though it does not contain any extras it is still worth getting. So if your a John Schneider fan or a person who likes natural disaster movies then I absolutely reccomend it and buying the Night Of The Twisters DVD to."
4,Exactly what I ordered,I ordered these boots online and I loved them. The only reason they didnt get a five star was because I tried on a size 8.5 in the store they fit so I ordered a 8.5 online they are not the same. Sizes seem to run smaller.
5,Perfect!,"Great boots, absolutely love them! Shipping was prompt and on time! :) I will be ordering again as these were a gift and I want my own! :)"
5,Great boots,"I am very pleased with the material and the design of my new boots. They are so comfortable. I usually can't wear boots all day, but these are like wearing slippers. I am glad I bought them."
4,Comfortable and Versatile,"I've been wearing my FatBaby boots nearly every day this winter. They're comfortable, durable and go with skirts and pants. Great buy!"
1,Appalling failure by Amazon to respond !!!!!!!,I have NOT received this product but I have been chargerd for the product AND shipping. I have notified Amazon of this and received NO acknowledgment ......... Having spent $$$$$$ with you in the past I request that you attend to this ASAP
3,"Cable Good, Tie Out Bad","We bought this to go camping with our lab puppy.Screwed the Tie Out into the ground, attached to puppy, and seconds later puppy was bounding into our laps with Tie Out attached.We took cable off the tie out, attached it around a pole, and that worked beautifully for the rest of the weekend. (and he ran and tugged against it)."
5,"Amazing album, but STAY AWAY from the Vinyl Lovers pressing!","As any Cale fan knows, Fear is one of his many masterworks, but regarding the recent Vinyl Lovers reissue, stay the hell away from it. It sounds worse than any cd version. Either get the Island Years collection, or (ideally) an original UK vinyl pressing. These so-called ""Vinyl Lovers"" are a shady bunch, cashing in on resurgence of vinyl."
5,Better than expected!,These little guys were high quality dolls. Larger than the usual figures but not too big. My son loves them.
1,Picture misrepresents product,This picture mis-represents the toy. Each figurine is individually mounted on a round base that can easily break off. I was hoping for a more traditional set of figurines for my children to play make pretend with.
3,For a cake!,"I bought this set so I can put then on the top of a cake, the figures were a little heavy for this, but they are very nice!"
4,This is mainly Mick Taylor's record,"One of the best from the early John Mayall's Bluesbreakers live discs.In my view, this is due to an outstanding guitar solos by Mick Taylor and a first-class backing by Dick Heckstall-Smith on tenor and soprano. John's vocals are great, too. The rest of the group: Keith Tillman on bass, Keef Hartley on drums, Chris Mercer on tenor and baritone. The first song on this album was recorded with Paul Williams on bass.Original tapes were made by John Mayall, at a 3 and three quarters ips, which is the reason for less than stellar sound quality, even after digital remastering. But the album is a true documentary from the life of the band on the road. It sounds very authentic and pure without the use of an engineer/production crew.If you are Mayall's fan, this recording is a must-have. The material contained here far outweighs poor sound quality."
1,Polaroid Nudes,"Why would a photo artist choose a large format for Polariod-sized pictures? That's what you get with Andreas Bitesnich's Pola Nude. There is not one picture in the entire book that takes up more than half the page. With approximately 60% of the pages what you get is two polariod-sized pictures side by side-- quarter-inch white borders and the rest is black background. I get so tired trying to see what the picture is about, that I literally get fatigued looking at this book.Many of the pictures seem interesting. However, with much of the magic of the human form obscured by small format photos lost in a sea of black, there are too few rewards to justify the price."
5,Must read for mardi GRAS enthusiasts,"Great read on the history and culture surrounding the mardi GRAS that most people outside of Louisiana have no idea about. Very good read, takes the point of view from current times and mixes in history as backstory. As a an annual purtaker in carnival here in new Orleans I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to enthusiasts as well as anyone interested in new Orishas history!"
2,Temerous erudition = persnickitously gauche anachronisms,"This book is jam packed with amazing stories. Unfortuantely Gill's inability to organize information by chronology or theme, and his insistence on using as many big words as possible, as well as paragraphs that never seem to end or make a point, make it really hard to follow. I frequently found myself skipping back several pages to try to figure out who he was talking about and why, and was generally unable to do anything but completely lose track of the loose thread of narative that appears occasionaly throughout chapters with names that seemingly have little to do with their contents. Too bad, because apparently a lot of people died and fought and drank and screwed. In what order, I will have to look elsewhere to find out."
5,a real hit,"this is a must have for true Dallas Fans it has alot of stuff, plus a lot of extras & is worth the watch"
2,poor audio,It was nice to see everyone again but the recording was poor. It was like someone just purchase a cameria and decidied to record at the last minute. The video was boring.
3,DALLAS 30-Year Reunion at Southfork (2-Disc Set),It was like being at Southfork again. It brought back nice memories. Only thing missing at my visit were the actors. This put them there and they were answering questions.
1,Dallas 30-year Reunion at Soutfork,I was watch all the series of Dallas. And I purchased the whole series. I was expecting more. Dallas women with their beautiful gowns and Dallas men with their texudos. I know it was 30 years later. I just expected more. It seem we just saw the cast talking and answered questions. Not what I expected. Thats all.
4,A Great Read!,"I love this book. And what an unusual setting for the romance. A home for unwed mothers. Prudence and Brock are made for each other.The most delightful thing about the book is the people you think you're going to hate end up being good guys. Even the villain gets the correct come-uppance in the end and turns out to be sort of OK.The unwed mothers add much to the story. They don't seem to be just incidental. And their stories are so individual. I got teary at a certain point in the book but don't want to give away that part of the story by telling of it here. For the most part, the book is fairly upbeat and lovely read.Get it used or from your library. But read it. Now, I want to read some others of Ms. Criswell's books. This was her first for me."
5,"""A MUST HAVE FOR ALL DEER HUNTERS""","This book is an outstanding collection of writings and nostalgia from our 19th century deer camps, and the history surrounding their colorful occupants. This book brings the reader back to the roots of our deer-hunting heritage. A must read for all who have lost touch with deer hunting and need to reconnect with this time honored tradition. Robert Wegner has truly created a masterpiece with this book. Within his writing he continues to spotlight the White-tailed deer, an animal that has had a profound positive impact on the evolution of America and the American Hunter."
4,Very Nice Tai Chi Volume,"This is a great book for anyone seriously studying Taiji as a martial art. It's a collection of articles on the history, various styles, principles and weapons of Taijiquan. There is information on some lesser known facets as well, such as the 2-man fighting set, free fighting, and Taiji whip, and there are articles by William CC Chen, Doc Fai Wong, Chen Xiao Wang, Jane Hallander and others. My only complaint is that they waste ~75 pages showing the Yang long form--as the rest of this book covers some very advanced subjects, and is NOT a ""how to"" guide for beginners. If they had filled those pages with more articles of the same quality as those in the rest of the book, I'd give it five stars."
5,most important rock band of 1990s,"This record is an excellent introduction to the crushing futuristic might of the most innovative band in rock.The Young Gods combine dub,hiphop,avantgarde and metal into a hairraising masterpiece.Pure liquid chromium."
4,Reasonably good effort,"This is my first abbreviation/acronym dictionary, so I don't have much for comparison. This one, though, does seem to have quite a bit, though nowhere near what you'd think from the reviews. Many of the 60,000 entries are simply alternate options for a few abbreviations. As for acronyms, many are missing from current technical lingo. I like the book, but for a hardback boasting so many entries, I did expect to find many obscure abbreviations which just don't seem to be there."
4,Nice little dust collector! Two minor negatives!,"This Jet unit is a nice bargain. Good quiet motor providing excellent suction for a unit of this size, it nonetheless has two shortcomings. The first is the dust port attachment being very unwieldy, especially when you try to position it more or less precisely next to your stationary power tool. The motor and the frame seem to get in the way a lot. The other complaint is that when the motor is turned off, the bag falls flat onto the ground, resulting in the collection bag getting very dirty in no time. Maybe a way to hook the end of the bag onto the frame would help. It is relatively heavy, so pushing it around your shop on the small plastic casters is not very mobile. You might want to mount it on a piece of plywood with larger rubber casters."
2,WATCH OUT!,"When I recieved this item it contained the blower and bag ONLY! No hose. No extension arm. No dust port. All those items have to be ordered seperately.I complainded to Amazon about this and they were very courteous and prompt in apologizing. Naturally, I was offered a full refund.This is actually a good powerful unit. I just can't believe that JET is so cheap that they won't include a few bucks worth of cheap hardware."
2,What you see is Not what you get,"Unit does not include the flex hose, the extension arm, or the dust hood. In the June,03 tool crib catalog pg.28 the description ""Packaged with adjustable extension arms, you can position the dust port exactly where you need it."" This is not misleading advertising,this is false advertising. I am pretty sure there are laws concerning false advertising"
5,Buy Now,"Make no mistake, this album is a must have for any Heep/Byron fan. Every rock fan should take the time to learn the Byron era Heep catalog, particularly ""Demons and Wizards"". Please buy ""Demons and Wizards"". Really. It is nothing short of shameful that Heep is not widely recognized as one of the top rock acts of all time and David Byron as one of the top vocalists. Don't even mention guys like Freddie Mercury until you first mention my man DB. There are a few real gems on this album such as ""Hit Me With a White One"", the story of a cowboy seeking deadly revenge with the assistance of alcohol. Beware of the violent impact of the ""guts full of lead"" line. Man those Brits love cowboys. Also, mad props to Mick Box for the guitar solo in ""Midnight Flyer"" - it just doesn't get any better. Finally, I'd like to personally wish the Magician a Happy Birthday!"
3,David Byron - 'Take No Prisoners' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1975, as this was the former (late) Uriah Heep's frontman first of two solo records. Nothing to get all that excited about but an overall 'okay' CD reissue. Tunes that make this title (sort of) a keeper are ""Man Full Of Yesterdays"", the rocking ""Steamin' Along"", ""Silver White Man"" ""Saturday Night"". Check out the additional line-up - fellow Heep(sters) Mick Box - guitar, Lee Kerslake - drums with Dennis Ball - bass and Lou Stonebridge - keyboards. If you're a Uriah Heep die-hard or completist, then you might obviously get more out of 'Take No Prisoners' than I did."
2,looking for a lost gem,"please don't take this wrong because i am a big d.byron and uriah heep fan,i had been looking for any of his solo albums for a long time and was so surprised to find it here at amazon,but after looking for this possible lost gem and finally getting it iwas unfortunately disappointed. but after listening to it for a while longer the songs grew on me more so,demons and wizards its not but if you are a hard core david byron fan it does merit at least several listenings..."
4,Titanium Thresher Sandal,"Awesome sandal with one small complaint. The back strap does not seem to have enough velcro. When I tighten the sandal, there is a large overlap that could be solved with more velcro. Either that or my foot is weird...Great outdoor sandal though, I use mine mostly while fishing and they work terrific."
1,WHY only one map per community???,"I used this map for many years, and never wondered if it had any relationship to why I was getting lost all the time. Then I got a new map that is continuous. Suddenly, I could find myself when I needed to get somewhere! I didn't have to know what town I was in in order to plan a route! All the maps were at the same scale; I could tell how far away something was by where it was on the map!That fine map has since gone out of print. I don't understand why people keep buying maps like this, instead of demanding the kind of continuous scale, contiguous maps that people everywhere else in the USA are using.Please join me in boycotting this type of map utnil they wise up. There is a ""Pocket Boston Map"" on sale that is done properly, at least for all the communities inside 128. Buy that instead!"
4,great game but very bad online play,I loved this game and I would totally recomend this to any fan of the series or genre. great single player campaign and a much gritter storyline is a major plus especially for the splinter cell vets like myself. online on the other hand is where the game falls short to me to many bugs/glitches is a big letdown. otherwise totally recomend this game to any fan of the stealth action genre or fan of the series.
1,Machine by any other name...,"..would be trash!Though the lead actors in this flick are enough to make you want to watch it...the movie itself makes you want to poke your eyes out. The horrible cinematography, the disastrous lighting...and the non existent blocking in allot of the scenes makes this hot mess just a pain to sit through. I don't know if the producers of this flick spent all of the money on Micheal Madson or what happened but he is easily the best thing about the turd...and he is not enough to save it."
3,machine = 3.5 stars,"This movie was kinda of low budget , but with good acting . Had some likable characters. I think it has to be followed closly to know everything going on . i rented it , and thought it was a alright movie ."
1,It is undeliverable without a reason,I felt very strange when I got a email which told me that this item was undeliverable with no reason. I got refund for this purchase. It wasted my time to buy this item.
4,"It's great, only if you like heart throbing beats.","I liked the style of this cd, it's a relax, sit back and enjoy type thing. But since it was so far out, I think it deserves an honest four."
4,NIN goes more techno,"There are more then a few nin fans I know who don't like this CD, but I guess that could be expected. This is definitly off track from most of Trent Reznor's other work. None of these mixes are really very close to the original either. I would recomend this CD either for people who are interested in electronic music (drum 'n bass especially) or who don't mind hearing Trent doing something different. I agree with the other reviews though, you should not own this CD without also having the original version."
5,4,"this song is like an awakeing. It reminds me of how I felt. I understand the perfect drug, and its' not somethinig that can be perscribed......Pablo"
2,It's not worth it,"This CD isn't that good. Nine Inch Nails is a great band, and Trent Reznor is a genious, but this CD fails to show that. The five remixes aren't very good, and it doesn't include the actual song. Also, the remixes contain almost no lyrics, except some that are constantly repeated, and the average remix is 7 minutes long. This single would have been much better if it included the actual track."
3,"good, but flawed","the mixes on this cd are great. its not the typical nin remix cd that most are familiar with.the song the perfect drug is remixed here by 4 electronica/techno groups plus nin.all the mixes are great, and its definitely an album you can play over and over.but i REALLY wish they wouldve included the original version on it.i bought this cd without having heard the original [which i now own thanks to itunes] and i was pretty happy with it.this is a good cd for halo collectors, and fans of electronic music, etc...the art was also interesting.very active and wild on the front and calm and subtle inside.i was pleasantly surprised when i opened it up.this is a minor detail to most people, but album art is half the reason why i still buy cds."
2,Hey...Trent's allowed to make mistakes too,"I love the song Perfect Drug, so naturally I bought it's EP. That's where I ran into problem #1, the original Perfect Drug is not on the album. Sure the remixes are intresting to say the least but each one sans Trent's version get boring really quickly as they just seem to float in limbo for 7 minutes.Casual NIN fans need not apply, but for a halo collector like me...well it doesn't really matter whats on the actuall disc."
1,"Least Favorite of all NIN ""remixes""","I'm a big fan of NIN, I collect all thier CD's, DVD's and VHS tapes and I LOVE 99.9% of everything I've heard and seen, including the remix CD's. This CD falls into the .1% of ""Hate It"" category. I would prefer to get my teeth drilled to having listen to the CD again. I'll keep it in my collection because I am a Collector."
1,Don't Spend Your Money,"This is NOT the song from the soundtrack..and I don't care WHO remixed it, the whole CD sounds like you are playing the soundtrack version while flushing your toilet continuously. Sorry, I usually LOVE anything Trent does. Come back to us, Trent...P.S. Splurge on the Lost Highway Soundtrack instead...you get the original kick-azz version of the song plus a complete selection of music guaranteed to creep you out...but in a good way."
2,Perfect Drug Versions Disc Not so perfect,"I am going to get straight to the point. If you are not a HUGE nin fan nor are you collecting all the singles and albums i would not recomend you purchase this cd. it does not include the original version of the song (which is the only good version i have heard) . only the japanese import includes it as a 6th track.i purchased this cd when it came out 10 years ago, and i was disapointed. the mixes are long drawn out and just do not catch your ear.but , like i said, if you are a collector of NIN cds, it is essential just like everything else. so for that matter, its worth the 6 bucks.but if your not a HUGE fan, i wouldnt buy it."
2,What was Trent Reznor thinking?,"This is a tragic mistake. Most of the time, Trent Reznor relies upon himself and a few close collaborators to work on remixing NIN's music. The results are always fascinating, and often become equally valid versions of the song in their own right - that's why Trent Reznor always refers to them as ""versions"" NOT remixes. Here, though, Reznor has got a variety of people together to work on The Perfect Drug, and the results are not worthy of a NIN release. Trent Reznor's own remix (track 3) is excellent, and the only redeeming feature of the disc - it's very exciting and powerful, exploring the driving rhythms of the original, now infected with drums and bass. But the other remixes do not compare - they're interesting enough, but for most of the time they have almost no connection to the original song, which defeats the point of the exercise. Buy it for Reznor's version, but don't expect the same excellence from the other tracks....."
2,Stick with the original,"Don't get me wrong, I think ""Perfect Drug"" is one of the best songs to ever come from Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails outfit, but this CD single is for die hard NIN fans only who don't already own the original song featured on the Lost Highway soundtrack. There are five tracks of remixes, one of which done by Reznor which is the only track that comes close to resembling the original song. The other four tracks are loaded with remixed industrial loops and blips that borderline on annoying and is kind of boring. These remixes really don't hold a candle to the original, and your better off getting the Lost Highway soundtrack considering this single doesn't even include the original song. All in all, this Halo is for die hard NIN fans only."
3,Great CD for Remix Lovers,"- If it's the basic/radio version of Perfect Drug you're into, buy the Lost Highway soundtrack. Not only is the ""original"" song on there, but also tons of other great material.- I agree with others who say this does still sound like NIN - remixes are meant to sound different - listen to the previews to judge whether it's too abstract for your taste.- The three-star rating does not reflect different interpretations of the song - these are abundant and their multitude justified by the varying musical directions applied. It does reflect the fact that this just isn't my favorite NIN song - in any version. I much prefer singles like March of the Pigs, which offer (less subtle) remixes along with the original, or for your money's worth of remixes I strongly suggest the album-like Further Down the Spiral.In summary: buy this single only if you're really into Perfect Drug AND interpretive remixes."
3,"It ain't perfect, but for NIN fans","I am an NIN fan, but this CD starts out good, then just goes nowhere. The Orb did a redundant remix of ""The Perfect Drug."" Not only that, they made it horrible. I like the NIN one, the Spacetime C. one takes attention span, and the one that Jack Dengers of MBM (Meat Beat Manifesto) did was pretty cool, also. Not bad, but not NIN's best. For easier mixes to get used to, try something like ""Closer To God"" or the ""Further Down The Spiral"" remix EP."
1,WHAT A MISTAKE!!!,"WOW this album REALLY ... and im highly sure trent would agree with me! if you really want to hear the perfect drug buy the lost highway soundtrack because that is the only place you will find the (not remixed) song. along with buying lost highway you will find music that will agree with you such as manson, bowie, lou reed and ramstein... and SOMEONE ... who said this album is closely rivaled with closer. ..."
1,Ugh,"This is so whack and un-NIN, mainly due to the remixings by people with absolutely no musical relation to NIN. Even the NIN remix is bad. The original song isn't even included. Trent, I love ya man, but for the love of God, don't let other people taint your work again."
1,not as good as hoped,"I enjoyed the original version better. You can find it on the lost highways soundtrack. plus +++you get songs by Marilyn Manson, trent reznor, david bowie, smashing pumpkins and rammstien. Much better. take my advise and buy that instead"
1,The Perfect Drug,"Absolute Rubbish,not even close to the brilliance of the original recording.If you loved the original like I did you will hate this."
1,A CD Single without the original song?,"I remember I bought this CD hoping for the original version of Perfect Drug, and I got 5 remixes that were odd and interesting, but not the actual song. I had to buy an import release that had a 6th track that included original version."
5,Perfect Drug Remix Album,"So many of ya'll might love the original to death. To me, it's aight, its good, but these remixes are even better.My favorite tracks off this is Spacetime Continuum's phenominal remix, Luke Vibert's smash, and Trent + Keith's remix. I gotta also mention Meat Beat's remix, thumbs up. The Orb's was so-so, and was more annoying than amuzing but I give it a play every now and then."
3,"Decent, but you don't get the original song","I bought this because i like the song, perfect drug, but unfortunatley, it was nowhere to be found on this disc which consists of remixes, which, in my opinion are so interpretive of the original song, that there are few resemblances to the original at all. So i was a bit disappointed. But of course if you are a hardcore NIN fan, you'll have to have this, but if you aren't as hardcore, but like NIN, this isn't worth it, you're better off buying the Lost highway soundtrack if you want The original version of perfect drug."
2,What's the point?,"Okay, so I've read that this would be a great CD for serious NIN collectors. Of course, if you already ARE are a serious nin collector, then you'd have all these tracks already, wouldn't you? EVEN IF you didn't own ""Lost Highway,"" the original version of Perfect Drug is on one of the WITTN discs (3rd one, I think.) Anyway, this release has irritated me as much as the last one (Into the Void), as it only has pre-released material. And before that, I had to buy 3 discs for a couple (weak) remixes. Trent, I love ya man, but come on here, we waited five years for this? Regurgitated material is seriously disappointing. Give us something more...."
2,Nine Inch Nails - The Perfect Drug Versions,"When i first heard The Perfect Drug, I was blown away, it's an amazing song, so I of course snapped up The Lost Highway soundtrack and then this CD when it was released. To my complete surprise, The Perfect Drug was not on the disc! In it's place were 5 unrecognizable remixes. Sub-par at best, this release was a great disappointment, and while the remixes were not all bad, they did completely wreck an otherwise beautiful song, and that is unforgiveable. So needless to say, this CD single is best avoided unless you a fan of the remixers or a NIN completist."
3,"OK, just OK","I'll admit, I bought this CD for th original version and I was very dissapointed when looked closer and found out the original version wasn't on it. I gave the CD a chance just because I love Reznors work and thought it would be ok. It is an ok CD in small doses. Some of the remixes are very repetitive and it gets to the point where they are just annoying. The best track is Reznors own remix. This is definitely only a CD for people who are obsessive NIN fans. Those who like NIN but aren't obsessive would not enjoy this CD at all. The best thing about this was when I realized the original wasn't on it so I bought the Lost Highway soundtrack. If you liked the original just buy that."
1,"Screw Objectivity, This Sucks!","Okay, so usually I can be open minded about too many singles filled with too many remixes and not enough original material, but I'm throwing objectivity out the window and letting fly on this piece of sh*te.5 boring and repetitive remixes of The Perfect Drug, and the original version isn't even on here.Get ""The Day the World Went Away Pt. 3"" and consider yourself saved.F*ck you Reznor."
3,Too bad,"Too bad the original version's absent. Not everyone wants to get the Lost Highway Sdtk and the mixes are too mediocre to validate spending as much on the import as on a typical album. Reznor finally comes up with a nice track to then exclude the best version, it just doesn't make sense. The NIN and Luke Vibert mixes are the highlights but overall there's nothing special. Nice gimmick and packaging though."
3,"Very Good, but also very bad...","This Cd would kick some serious butt if the single had been included along with the remixes... My advice: buy the import, it cost just a little bit more, but the single is included on it"
5,WHO are the perfect drug? Maybe.....ABSINTHE?,"5 totally different versions of the song PERFECT DRUG mark halo 11. Track three is the longest version and the only 'other' version of perfect drug done by NIN. The other 4 songs are by different bands. NEVER FEAR, the original version of Perfect Drug is found on: Lost Highway (sndtrk)`96, Halo 12 ""Closure"" vhs (2-Tape set)`97 and on Halo 15 (the one with WITT, Complications of the Flesh and...Perfect Drug)`99. If you like weird 'industrial/techno/rave sounds' halo 11 is the disc of choice. Whirrs, Rumbles, Tumbles, Rolls, Bubbles, Buzzes and more await you on Perfect Drug ""Versions"" halo 11!"
1,This isn't a real good cd,"I am a NIN fan but this cd got me really disapointed. The remixes are pretty good, but all he says is You are the perfect drug. I think if your thinking about getting this, you should get the soundtrack instead."
4,Oops! Its in Hebrew,While on a small passenger ship sailing from Cyprus to Haifa this summer I met Murray Greenfield. He spoke to my youth group about his participation in the aliya bet. When I returned home I ordered his book from amazon.com but when it arrived I discovered that I had been sent the Hebrew version. Nowhere did the order form have a place to specify language.
3,The Altar of the Dead,"The Altar of the Dead, by Henry James, about a man bsessed with worshipping his dead, is overall a good book. There are some confusing points in the book, mostly due to the fact that it was written in the early 1900's. The subject is very interesting though, and I really liked the ending. I give it 3 stars!!"
3,"A strong debut, but...","This is a good CD of harder-edged synthpop. While I like all the songs on this CD, when I have time to listen to only a few songs from this CD, I always go to the same ones: ""Our Tomorrow"", ""Balance of ""Minds"", ""Reflect"". Not that the other songs aren't good... they ARE. I just like a lot of other synthpop CDs more than this one. In fact, I like the ""Our Tomorrow"" and ""Eternal Insane"" CD singles with their remixes and extra tracks much more than this full-length CD. A good debut, but I've heard better."
4,The sign of wonderful talents..........,"I have this first album from THE NINE after owning their second album ""Dreamland."" So, compare to the second album, I give this first album 4 stars instead of 5 stars.It's not a bad album by any means. You can see their musical talents emerging here. This album is more raw; some of the songs are more 'alternative' oriented rather than synthpop per-se. So, if you're a fan of synthesizers/electronica, you should get their second album (""Dreamland"") instead. ""Dreamland"" is more polished and more catchy. You'll get hooked right away by THE NINE.If you're a fan of THE NINE, you should get this first album too to complete your collection. Therefore, you'll be able to see how their musical evolution started. I can't wait to see more from this group. Keep on a good work guys!! Peace !!"
5,HOW MUCH MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR!!,"I had never heard anything of DJ HARDWARE until I took a gamble and bought this cd. All I can say is, ""how lucky can I get?!"" The first track on this album sets the tone for the rest of the cd. For once, I have a cd that is balls to the wall energy from start to finish. ""Let the Drums Speak"" has a dark sound to it, but it also has a hard, trancy, energetic sound as well. It would be a BIG mistake not to have this album in your cd collection!!!"
5,Hot Proggresive House mix!,"nice proghouse and dark house mix's, especially cd 2 almost every track is a standout track. good energy bass lines and dark beats. this is a pretty old mix but its timeless. GREAT PRICE ONLY 3 BUCKS!"
5,Laid back JJ Cale rocks,"Cale is an incredibly versatile songwriter, as well as an excellent guitarist, and it is a wonder more people don't already know of him. This album contains a number of superior pieces, including Wish I Had Not Said That, Crazy Mama, Cajun Moon, Cherry, Cocaine, etc."
1,"Poor research, shoddily written","Not sure how this book ever came into print. Scholarship is on par with high school level, and the writing less than interesting. Her grasp of the world is such that I suspect Goldstone has seen the world mostly through the lobbies of great hotels."
2,Journalism not quite at its worst,"This is a book that tries to be serious, but misses the mark. Why a professor at Smith College would have it on his reading list might seem to be some sort of endorsement, but surely not.The book is full of errors, and badly edited. Everything from (obviously) a false ratio of men to women in Cuba, a reference to Central America as a country (!) to Herodotus's descriptions of Alexander the Great's incursions into Persia a hundred years before Alexander was even born. And where does she get a Cuban economy of $2.5 billion in 1999, when it was somewhere around ten times that amount.It's written in the sort of style one might encounter in a regional newspaper's week-end edition, hardly the stuff of serious study and research. Continuity is a little slipshod as one reads from page to pageAnd there is no index.A fistful of errors means that one cannot trust the book.Not recommended."
5,Get ready to laugh!,"Here is a histarical book about a chicken who dreams of being a famous ballerina and puts herself in danger of a wolf just for her one big chance. My daughter, and mother and I were all just roaring with laughter. My mother can do a wonderful southern accent and applied it to Poulette's voice. It was great! This book is great to do voices with for the different charectors! You're child will LOVE it! My daughter brought this book home from the school library and we got such a huge kick out of it we have told lots of people about it. I just had to buy a copy for my family! It is a ""must-have""! You won't be dissappointed! A great one to read to your elementary children's class room! Nice easy reading that isn't too long before bed time too! :)"
2,groundbreaking...not!,"Save your money. The philosophy is simple - positive thoughts are better than negative. Yes, thinking positively about something can only help to lead you to it since it becomes a goal, but to imply that the universe will magically make it happen is hogwash. The author sites examples in his life that support his theory, but I say it's coincidence. If you drank a glass of water before each time you drove your car and you never had an accident, you could conclude that drinking water makes you a better driver or protects you while you drive. This is the same silly conclusion that he wants you to believe. ""A drink of water protects while driving"". Uh oh, I just gave him an idea for his next earth shattering inspiration."
5,I loved it,I am really enjoying listening to Mike Dooley. The CD's are entertaining and informative and they arrived quickly and in good shape.
3,Moderately satisfied,The CD was entertaining and somewhat helpful but not as powerful as others I have listened to.
5,profound,"Without question, this is a most powerful concept of manifestation of thought energy.. Our thoughts (with emotion) have power. This tape expresses the basic simple steps for drawing to yourself those things you desire. IT is short and to the point, no fluffy waste. There are certain principles involved in the law of the universe, and the ability to think things into your reality is NOT wishful thinking.. I have used this method even before I heard this tape and I can vouch unequivocally that it works. This tape was wonderful reinforcement and confirmation of what I wholeheartedly believe to be true. Thoughts do become things."
3,"ok, but not dynamite",quality was difficult to hear due to live event recording. Content was ok but not dynamic like expected
3,very short!,"Not quite what I expected... I loved watching Drive Thru South America on Fuel, but this one did not measure up. It was also extrmemly short in length.. under 40 minutes! Not worth the $30, but maybe once the price gets under $20..."
4,"Not their best, but....","I will say that this has some of Primus' best songs (Nutterbutter, Wynonna, Pachyderm, Tweek, and Grapevine), but it also has a lot of filler (Baileen, Del Davis, Parrot,Space Farm).This album has enough insane musicianship to please veteren Primus fans, but if you're just looking to get into them get Frizzle Fry first."
2,The armpit of Primus,This album is 95% crap.I love Primus and own Frizle Fry and Seas of Cheese but this thing sounds about as good as screeching chaulk. It needs way more singing in most of the songs and almost none of them have choruses (which I find anoyying) Del Davis Tree Farm was one of the poorest excuses for a song I've heard and most of them weren't much better. The CD as a whole pretty much lacked the heavy bass beat from their older CDs. However Mrs. Blaileen and Southbound Pachyderm were OK and if you have unwanted guests at your home just pop in this CD and watch them run away! Works like a charm!
4,Good stuff,"This album is very prog-ish and very much Primus. This was my first Primus album, and it took me a litle while to get used to it. I really like the opening song ""Professor Nutbutter's House Of Treats"" (fast and fun), ""Wynona's Big Brown Beaver"" (groovy), ""Southbound Pachyderm"" (hypnotic), ""Year Of The Parrot"" (I don't know, it's cool!), ""De Anza Jig"" (frickin' hilarious!), and ""On The Tweek Again"" (rawk!). Great album for the Primus fan and very underrated."
3,Wynona's Big Brown Beaver...,"One reviewer stated that if it wasn't for Wynona's Big Brown Beaver, this album would be a flop. That is mostly true. The song Southbound Pachyderm is somewhat overrated, it isn't nearly as good as My Name is Mud. The video is really cool, but that doesn't relate. All these songs need to be listened to carefully in order to appreciate them."
1,not the greatest,even according to les himself this is a record company forced album and not their best material. they were forced to make this album to oblige their contract. les himself said primus will never go into the studio under these pretenses again. also partially what caused herb to leave.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd is terrible. I used to defend Primus when my friends made fun of them, but now I will voluntarily state that I have purcahsed the worst cd ever. I read the rest of these online reviews, and they all gave it 4-5 stars. They must have been drunk. If you are to buy this cd, you will just be wasting a good 12 bucks that could've bought you korns follow the leader. Buy that instead. If you already have this cd, break or burn it so that it will plague humanity no longer."
1,worst band of all time,"listening to this cd made me want to start my own band. I have never picked up a guitar, but no matter. ANYBODY could make better music than this primordial slime so cleverly disguised as music.These guys should never have been let out of the garage.(or asylum, perhaps?) I tried to make myself like this cd by repeated listenings, maybe it would grow on me. Not the case my friend.In fact I actually had to struggle to keep my lunch down. Unfortunately i did not buy this but only borrowed it from the local library while trying to ""broaden my horizons"". And try as I could, i just could not bring myself to set fire to library material. If you did make the mistake of buying it, go save the planet and destroy it now. We wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands now. It could give new meaning to cruel and unusual punishment. Suggested alternative: anything by Beefheart or Bowie. Listen with an open mind. You'll thank me."
3,My favourite from Primus,"Many of us bought this album after seeing the video for ""Wynona's big brown beaver"", and I was one of those people... Rest of the album is quality stuff too, but my favourite songs are Wynona, De ana jig, Over the electric grapewine and Dr nutbutter's house of treats.If you like your music weird, get this thingy now!"
4,"Different times, different rhymes","TFTPB is a veeeeeeeerrrrry different and innovative album from Primus. Compared to others, this cd is weird. But compared to other 1995 rock albums this one is a very amazing and inventive cd. If you want a glimpse of Primus in their rough days, or just want to get away from the real rock world, *Primus Sucks when it comes to Punchbowl.*(if you are a true Primus fan you know what this means.)"
2,THIS IS LES CLAYPOOL'S BRAIN ON CRACK,"This is the worst Primus album, easily. Herb left the band right after the completion of this atrocity which says a lot about the state of the band. Tales is completely inaccessible(which is good in a way) but only because the music is incomprehensible. Claypool still manages to cram a nice amount of sick bass riffs in here, but the playing is uneven. Some of the tracks meander on for upwards of seven minutes and the lyrics are trademark ridiculous as always. Ler's guitar playing is scattered but brilliant in spots. This is definitely the low point of the Primus catalog. Thank God for Antipop, this is for hardcore Primus completists only."
2,wrong format,"I must say I was disappointed, I received the VHS version which was not the right one. I in turn sent an email stating if the was my fault I would like to return it and get the DVD since I do not have a VHS player. I quickly received a response stating not to worry a DVD is on the way. It is been about a month, since then two email was sent from me wondering what happened, No response as of yet. I guess I just lost my money and a VHS I can't use."
4,The Miracle....Truly Is,"I saw this film when I was about 6 years old and have been looking for it on video ever since.A bit draggy during Theresa's (Caroll Baker) gypsy days...other wise thoroughly engaging, and thought provoking.I remember, as a child, when the Madonna took Theresa's place in the convent, we saw the Madonna's face.....now for some reason, they superimpose Theresa's face over the Madonna's.....dont know why."
5,The Miracle [ 1959 ],"THE MIRACLE, Was a Wonderful Movie, I saw it a few years ago.and I just loved it. I have been watching for it to be put on DVD.Every one who watched it with me, also loved it."
5,Creationism Is Not Proper Hinduism,"As a Hindu, I am ashamed of creationist pseudoscience committed in my name. Hinduism has always taught that the world is just a show; we call Shiva the Lord of Illusion. Why not honestly treat the artifact/fossil records as part of that illusion, instead of dishonestly, obsessively trying to twist them into what they can never be? Think you can outsmart the Lord of Illusion? The framework was already there, you idiots - use it!Moreover, the Hindu religion has always embraced science and technology, viewing the scientific mind as a grace bestowed on us from the Gods. We are cerebral creatures, and our culture will not shy away from the fact that even the path to the human heart goes through the brain. Therefore, true Hindus will be grateful for Antiquity of Man and not in the least grateful to Thompson and Cremo."
2,"I don't like the ""Real"" One King Down","I know that ""God Loves Man Kills"" did not have the original singer of One King Down, but I must say it is the only album that sounded professional, original, and bad ass. This album is back to One King Down's roots as they now have their original singer back. And with the original singer comes their armature basement recorded like sound again. If you like the old school hard core sound this album may be for you, however, I am wishing the ""God Loves Man Kills"" singer reunites at some point."

5,Refrshingly Fantastic,"To put a label on this book seems a crime, but I will try anyways. It reminded me of ""Catcher in the Rye"" as seen through the eyes of Tim Burton.It started out as being a very odd title, that turned into an even odder story. The charicters were very well developed, and the author expressed his views on life and the world without coming off as preaching.The really puzziling thing about ""Fat Boy Saves World,"" is that I stole it from my library's teen section, and not the general fiction shelves. Trust me there is a lot more to get out of this book than most other teen novels. I would suggest it for any age."
3,hmmm....,"Well, this book wasn't BAD, per se...But it really wasn't that good either. Not badly written, badly plotted or badly imagined. But, not good either. A little bit cool, but a little bit boring. Almost exciting, sometimes.A mediocre read."
5,YES!!!!!!!,Purr Soul never got the recognition they deserved. I love the entire Cd and wish there was more. I h had the pleasure of seeing them in D.C. a few years back and loved every minute of it.
3,Soulful & Pure,"This is a nice album. It's typical R&B, but still good. Good for more than just ""the wedding song"", several good tracks. Pure Soul was never En Vogue, SWV, Xscape, or (thank goodness) Destiny's Child, but they are some talented vocalists. And they're one of Washington, DC's few national artists. Producers include Teddy Riley and Rafael Saadiq. Booklet does not include lyrics."
4,Great Card,"Ok, this thing is great. It works wonderfully with my Nike mp3 player. For those that complain about the price and the capacity, just look at the size of the thing. The only other media even close to it is Sony's memory gate chips, and those cost a heck of a lot more per mb then these do. And you who complain about the capacity maximum of only 64mb should note that Smart media is tops at 128, only compact flash is currently above that. Also, give the technology some time, traditional ram prices haven't always been so low, for those of you that can't remember back that far, just trust me (even though I am only 19 :) Also, if you have so many problems with it, then don't use it, there are three other memory technologies currently being used, and more coming. So if you want the price to rapidly fall and for disks to get monstrously huge, then start buying more of it. The R&D money for research is what your paying for don't forget."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH NIKE PSA AS OF APRIL 2002!!!!,"I purchased a Sandisk 64 MMC card for my Nike PSA 120 player. Unfortunately, it is no longer compatible with the Nike players. I called the Nike PSA help line (through Sonic Blue) at 254 299-2759 and they said that since some time in April 2002, the San Disk cards do not work on the Nike Players. The representative said that the Lexar cards do work however I am still waiting to test this out for myself. Very, very disappointing considering the rave reviews others have given for the San Disk and its compatibility with the Nike players. Amazon, please remove those outdated reviews."
1,Item did not work.,"My review sounds like the others.The (2) MMC's did not work in my Nike Rio player.I did not think I could have received 2 defective MMC'S but go figure. I tried new software, I talked to technical support for Rio & Sandisk. I Figured for sure it was just something I was doing wrong.I purchased a different brand MMC it worked perfectly in just a few seconds.Amazon is giving me a refund, very happy with the top notch service they provide."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited when I received my MMC in the mail today.When I transferred the first song onto the external memory of my Intel Personal Audio Player 3000 it went well. The trouble began after that. I was not able to transfer any other songs. It seemed to be working but after the second transfer the first song came up again. I tried another song.The same thing happened. Apparently, this is a known problem with the 64MB cards."
3,64MB is not enough,"I owned a Casio EM-500 pocket PC. Having brought an extra 64 MB MMC card, it is barely enough to hold all my stuff in my pocket PC. Otherwise, this MMC is a MUST for the EM-500 since it only has 16 MB of RAM. The access speed of this MMC is excellent. My only complain is the price and the capacity. The price for the MMC should be lower (like PC RAM price) and the capacity should be higher, at least 256 MB."
1,Doesn't work with Intel Audio Player 3000,"I bought a SanDisk card first thinking that the quality brand name would guarantee compatibility. But it did not work with my Intel Audio Player 3000. It copies 1 song 13 times instead of 13 songs once each. That's no good. Intel says it's SanDisk's error and SanDisk says it's Intel's problem. That leaves consumers caught in the middle. So I returned mine and bought the Simple Tech MMC card and it works like a charm! It was 10% cheaper too.I supposed I should have checked compatibility before buying, but you expect it to work when you buy the brand leader."
3,Just what I need,This Memory Card is just what I needed for my MP-3 Player and couldn't be happier with it .
3,Not bad,I bought this for one song. I learned the song for my musical group and probably haven't listened to any of the other songs on the disc.
4,Gauci's Angelica is incredible,Miriam Gauci in the role of Suor Angelica is more than enough reason to buy this inexpensive but surprisingly decent version of Puccini's Trittico.
3,Not good for new couples,"My husband and I received this book as a wedding gift. We tried several times to begin the study, which was a little disheartening. The book is written more for older couples who are dealing with different issues than those who are newly married. I would suggest Devotions for a Sacred Marriage for a younger couple."
4,Darkest Thoughts:,"B! Machine is a one man tower of power. He is leading the synth underground with his layered electronic textures, ambient beats, and meloncholy vocals. His mixing and production are phat with all sounds being crisp and up front. The style is somewhat dark, yet not melo-dramatic or boring. The lyrics are deep, honest, and revealing. Not all the tracks are floor packers, but I dig the overall mood. I recommend more than one listen for sure...Some of my favorites: ""Darkest Thoughts""/""Opal""**/""Foreign""/""Temple""/""The Difference""*/""Affliction""**"
5,"Good Basic Info on Bird Selection, Care, and Training","This book is an up to date book providing a general overview of bird care and training. This book is good for the beginner who is considering a bird or has just acquired their first bird. It is reasonably priced and packed with lots of information. You'll need to move on to more specialized books about bird care and training after reading this, but this book is an excellent start!"
3,Not a genuine Sony battery.,"The battery works fine, but the original advertisement led me to think I would be getting a genuine Sony brand battery, not a Chinese knockoff"
2,Battery to my Sony PDA,"I received my battery pack on time, but unfortunately I only used my battery pack for two weeks and then it suddenly failed. I don't know the reason; I supposed the battery pack was compatible with the Sony PEG NZ 90. Now the battery pack is death"
5,"Absolutly hilarious, I didn't want it to end; ingenious","I found the book SO funny, it was hard to put it down. I told all of my friends about it and recommended it highly to them, and they all love it. Freed is wonderful, and should be commended. Great job"
2,"""Dear Earnest &amp; Julio's"" job was filled long ago.","A book of rejection letters seems like a novel idea, until you realize that it seems like you've read it before, and it was funnier the first time. ""Dear Earnest and Julio"" is certainly well meaning enough, but it fails to establish as eccentric of a main chacater as comedian Don Novello did in his classic books with a similar take on corporate America : ""The Lazlo Letters : The Amazing, Real-Life, Actual Correspondence of Lazlo Toth, American"" AND ""Citizen Lazlo! : The Continuing, Unrelenting Correspondence of Lazlo Toth, American! Vol 2."" Novello got there first, and in no knock against Fred Grimes and David Freed, did it better the first time"
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed this more as a soap opera read and not true to history. The book is well written and quite engrossing and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a fun read without a lot of depth or true facts.
4,Strongly recommended for any Tudor fan!!!,"I was actually pleasantly surprised with this novel. Jane Seymour is definitely one of the more under-researched and written about queens of King Henry the VIII and this book was very well researched in my opinion. I loved how the author integrated the facts with some fiction to give the information more body and context. This book talks more about Jane's childhood and how she came to be King Henry's third queen. I do wish that the author would have talked a little bit more about the end of Jane's life, her death, and the time leading up to it. That part of the book just seemed a little rushed to me. Overall, this was a great read and I would strongly recommend it to any fan of Tudor history or of historical fiction."
5,A great read!,"This book provides background information on Jane Seymour. Info on Jane Seymour is sketchy, so I so not know how historically accurate the book is. However, it was very enjoyable."
4,Plain Jane is a smart Jane,"I like the format and find it very easy and smooth reading. It helps me to understand the way people survived in the period. Although Jane had little control of some areas of her life, her moral values swept through. I recommend this book as a quick read and thought provoking."
2,The History of Mayo,"This book contains many errors regarding family genealogies. Families with similar names have been confused and names are misspelled. Family information has not been properly researched, proofread, or edited."
5,LOVE IT!,This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching. We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
1,One star because it is not possible to rate it zero stars,"Oh, my ears! Joan Rivers meets William Hung.With all due respect to Dionne Warwick, do yourself a big favor and ""Walk on By"" this drivel when you come across it. You'll thank me for the money saved. After listening to this, I wish I were tone-deaf. No, that is too generous to this waste of music."
3,Not bad but not the best,Not a bad camera. No installation instructions in the box. But saying that it was easy to install. Only down fall is that the picture doesn't seem a clear as I expected. But for the cost I can't complain.
3,mi opinion,"La camara tiene buena definicion aunque no es muy buena de noche. Adicional a esto, en la imagen se vé pequeña pero en realidad es grande y dificil de ubicar en el vehiculo."
1,Another prime example of Chinese junk.,"This camera comes with no install instructions, and you are left guessing if it needs power all the time, or just when you are in reverse. Also, the installation drillbit they include would do good to cut through paper, let alone a bumper. This burned up before hardly making a scratch in my bumper.The low light rating is also a joke. You really can't see anything if it is near dark, let alone dark. I guess you get what you pay for -"
3,"Nice Camera, missing hole saw","I'd installed the camera in my Jeep Grand Cherokee with Pioneer 5600 DVD. The Installation was not simple, since I had to add extra video cable (the power cable is longer). As I noticed in other review, the hole saw that was supposed to come included in the kit was missing so I had to buy another one to be able to make the proper hole. The camera is water and dust resistant, and has a clear night vision, but since it has no angular lens (peep hole type) it doesn't cover both ends of the bumper and right there you miss the whole point of having a rear view camera. Just because of that, I would suggest further research of other similar products."
2,not enough angle of view,"not useful as backup camera as first you need to drill holes, then after you go through all that you realize that it doesn't have enough viewing angle so you miss to see the critical corners. Sitting in my garage since I uninstalled it."
2,not clear become foggy,"It's not clear, it becomes foggy, has poor visibility, is black and white at night and if you don't have a backup light you can't see.."
3,NOT WATERPROOF,"I have two of these cameras on my Mercedes Sprinter which has no windows. One is rear view, one is right side view. I love these cameras. They are wide angle without distorting more than your passenger side mirror---objects may be closer than they appear. BUT NO WAY ARE THEY WATERPROOF. The glass on the front of the camera is not sealed in any way and they take on moisture, malfunction till they dry out and after a while, they fail completely. I return them for exchange, but because I like them so much, I am remounting them behind a protective window."
2,.5 lux?,"How did they come up with .5 lux for this camera? While it maybe true, the chip they use is rated at less than 5 lux which makes me wonder if this then became .5 lux by accident or if it really is .5 lux. I suspect you might get some image at .5 lux but it would probably be very poor. Has anyone has tried to verify this spec.?"
1,this camera is sucks,I suppose to get this camera because is water prove but is raining and guess what? Is not working no more because get wet from the inside i just get it like 5 weeks a go and im very disappointed i wish i can get an other one or return this one i have an other camera in my Yukon and works perfect with no problem at all i just expected something like that ...
2,Flush Mount??,"The video quality is okay, but I'm pretty disappointed by the ""Flush Mount"" claim. The housing is about an inch or so long on the other side of the fitting. This means that once it's mounted, it still sticks out about 1 to 1.5 inches. It looks pretty stupid mounted like its supposed to be, so it will take some pretty crafty modifications on my part to make it flush. If I had it to do over again, I would have just went with the license plate camera. It would have probably worked out better if I had a bumper that already had the pop out for a backup camera, but mounted to the bumper of an f150, it sticks out like a sore thumb."
2,***Edited Reveiw ***,"I'm pretty impressed with this little camera thus far, it's better than I expected it to be. The hole saw included in the packaging worked like a dream, and the camera itself was a quick and painless install. I've only had it for a week so I can't comment on the longevity, but I can say the picture quality and the night vision quality are great for the price.****EDIT -03/31/11Not waterproof. When it rains this thing fogs up for days, only to become clear and crisp after it dries out. It's like that emotionally unstable ex that you want to love, but just can't."
3,average,"i would have given 5 stars but the hole saw that came with the camera caused some minor damage. WHY? i was drilling and the bit broke out of the hole saw causing the teeth to run astray. otherwise $30 for a reverse camera thagt has decent quality i'm content with the purchase,"
2,grainy picture,"Grainy picture. No instructions. Can't see corners of pickup. Extra wire on av cable, what is it for? No info on there website. How can anybody rate this 5 stars?"
4,works well,"This is a really good camera I have had it for about 3 months. It shows well in the day and night. during installation I sealed the point of entry for the wire with some clear silicone and alittle around the edges of the glass, wiping of the smudge. this makes it perfectly sealed even during torrential downpours.For those people reporting the camera flickering on and of during use, be sure to tape the rca joinings with a good quality tape probably 3m. and harness the wire well so it does not get damaged because it is not so good in quality."
1,the best singer ever heard,"If there is a singer in this world that exist i think this is only Francis cabrel when you listen his musics it like that you are in another world, he is a philosophe, a poet, a singer. Reading his textes is the must exiting thing you can do in this life, sentimental, moralist, good chritian, loving of the nature are the most principal theme that reflects his songs, he prooves himself as the best ever heard in this planet, whatsoever english, spanish, german and so on there is no one like him. I've been listen to his songs for about 15 to 17 years i never tired of him and i don't think i will be tired untill i died. i think i'm the #1 fan of cabrel."
4,Illumination of the time period that created Shakespeare the Writer,"Wow! Fascinating reading for those who love Shakespeare and would like to know more about the culture and family from which he sprang! Good reading, lots of quotes, and plenty of tidbits of data to pass along at gatherings and in class."
1,Tent for a doll,"I bought this toy thinking of my 2 kids, not in her doll. Never gave size of the tent, and when i received it a was surprise it is a tent for a little doll. Be aware of this when you buy this toy for your children. Amazon said it was for children from 3 to 8. This one was for a doll and never mentioned. Gave the size of the box it was shipped in but not the size of the tent."
5,A quick stress buster.,This is a great DVD to unwind at the end of the day. Get the kinks out of your body and your mind.
4,"Good Lord, what he gets away with","""Silky"" is actually a garage-rock effort, pretty far removed from Andre's R&B roots. But it's also the greatest garage-rock album of the '90s, and would have fit right alongside the Gories on the Crypt Records roster of the decade. For a 60+-year-old man, Andre's mind is strictly in the juvenile gutter, but at least he's a talented exhibitionist. References to sex (all types) abound, albeit with comparitively little obscenity. Two cuts especially, the obvious ""Let Me Put It In"" and the jealously apocalyptic ""Everybody Knew,"" make him sound like he's in physical pain. He growls, huffs, and doesn't give a damn what you think. What more could you ask?"
2,Another badly produced album spoils a great artist,"Like Williams' other recent CD, RED DIRT, this is so badly produced, you have a hard time hearing some of the lyrics--which are the whole point of the exercise. Massively loud, bad guitar work hammers the rest of the mix. (Surprise: The guitarist did dual duty as the ""producer"" of this mess.) Andre Williams needs to dump these clowns and get the kind of professional production he enjoyed in the 1950s."
4,Deep characters,I enjoyed reading this book. The depth of characters was unusual but extremely interesting but very much Laura Kinsale. Great read!
4,Good for a rainy evening,It was an enjoyable read. Laura Kinsale's style is sophisticated and there is always a twist. Worth the time to read it.
3,Martial Arts Meets Victorian Era,"This is a tough read. Unique to this story is the hero, Samuel Gerard - a successful businessman and highly skilled martial artist who was raised in Hawaii. What a firecracker combination to unleash upon Victorian England! The author does not explain much - but rather plunges the reader into a conglomeration of Japanese, Chinese, native Hawaiian and Victorian British culture and leaves the reader to sort it out. The premise for the story had great potential that was insufficiently developed. While it was refreshing that BOTH the man and woman encountered one another as virgins - their relationship remained superficial - their bond mainly sexual - as they did not converse with one another on topics of any depth. There is the hope that at the end of the story this could change... However, the author does a great service depicting the devastating, lifelong emotional harm suffered by children who are sexually abused."
1,It Must Be Me...,"I couldn't find it in this book...anywhere. I tried.I wanted to like this book even though I tend to shy away from these real uptight, judgemental prude types. Innocence is fine but some heroines are just too extreme for me. However, I still believed, with all the reviews that this would be a book to buy.Just could not get into these characters or the storyline at all.I thought Prince of Midnight was better than this and I can't say I would put IT on my top authors list by any stretch. Star literally went into the trash which is really rare for me.Just not my cuppa or picked a wrong day to read it I suppose."
3,Disappointed...,"I was so sad about this book. I love Laura Kinsale and her other books are just incredible. This book was so promising but it the story just felt wrong. I don't find it romantic that the hero is in love with another woman(for the entire book) and is just shattered when he must marry Leda. I know that he has issues but I really wondered what he felt for Leda. It seemed to be just lust and nothing beyond that. ALso, Leda herself is not a strong heroine. She just seemed kinda pathetic and with no real character. I'm sorry but the ""Dear Sir"" thing did nothing but annoy me. However I felt about this book I absolutely will read every other book by Kinsale. She is a wonderful writer."
4,Imaginative Book,"I loved this story, it was funny romantic and cruel all at the same time. I really like the way that Cinderella got back at her mean and evil step mom and step sisters. She did not deserve to be treated the way that her step mom treated her. But when her fairy godmother came and helped Cinderella get dressed and go to the ball. And the ending was pretty cool when the prince and Cinderella got married the same day that the prince found her."
1,CINDERELLA,"NEVER RECIVED BOOK, SO HOW CAN I REVIEW. YOU ARE LOCATED IN NY, AND ITS BEEN OVER A MONTH. YOUR SERVICE IS HORRIBLR AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY OVER A MONTH AGO! THANKS"
3,Disappointed,"Though the pictures are beautiful in this book, I'm disappointed in the editing of the story. There is more content than the Golden Book, but certain parts are eliminated. The story begins with Cinderella already living in the house with the evil Stepmother and two Stepsisters. The Golden book opens with Cinderella as a little girl, Ella, and mentions her father before he remarries. My daughter still loves to read it, but I'd love to find a version of the story that is completely unedited from start to finish."
2,Beautify Disney illustrations but poorly written,"I admit to being a Disney nut when I was a kid although Sleeping Beauty was my favorite ""princess"". When someone gave this to my 3 year old daughter I honestly thought she was a bit young to get into the whole ""Prince Charming will sweep me away"" thing. Unfortunately she is obsessed with both the book and the movie. There are the obviously dated themes of the stepmother and sisters (notice how apparently a big nose and brown eyes make someone instantly ugly?) and the getting married after a few dances. But in addition to that, which I could have overlooked, is the fact that the book is simply poorly written. The illustrations are taken directly from the movie and are beautiful. But the grammer is atrocious and the story lacks the continuity of the movie. I dread having to read this to her at bedtime."
2,Solaray 900 St Johns Wort,These are about one half priced of what I paid at my local health food store.
1,All frill - no melodies,"If you like one keyboard run after the other, you will like this. Every song sounds the same; only vague trace of a melody distinguishing one some from the next."
4,Quilters' gift,"This book was bought to give to a neighbor who makes quilts for cancer patients. She herself has very colorful creations in geometric forms, but this was new inspiration for her."
3,"Quilts are great. Poems, not so much.","Anna Grossnickle Hines, Pieces: A Year in Poems and Quilts (Greenwillow Books, 2001)I'm not sold an Anna Grossnickle Hines as a poet, based on this volume--the poems feel more like fifth-grade classroom exercises than they do poems--but that's not really what this book is about, is it? The star attraction here is the quilts, and that's what your kids will return to when they flip this book open themselves. Beautiful craftsmanship, well-shot, with enough differences in approach and strategy to keep things interesting. **"
1,"never should have been listed under ""quilts""","I did not want a poem book, I wanted a book with pattern for mini quilts to make. Not."
3,Viewers aware! disappointed!,"I agree with the review written by John Vantel on July 16, 2005. I am disappointed at this book. I can find much more valuable information at the small ""real estate"" section of ""Personal Finance for Canadians for Dummies"" than this whole book. The book has compiled a simple to-do-list for people who will be interested in doing real estate investment. It is an ok job. I think the main purpose for this book is rather to get people sign in for their monthly paid membership program or attend their seminars. Just to be aware."
1,very disappointed,"Real Estate Investing in Canada by Don Campbell does not teach anything special. If you do some search on internet, you can find a lot of similar materials for free. Some calculations and most of the suggestions in the book are not practical at all. Buying properties is explained based on the negotation with the vendor. In practice, negotations take place between the realtors. You do not even see the vendor's face. There is no information in the book that is specific to Canadian Real Estate Market either. I am extremely disappointed."
5,Timely,"Thanks, this book was very timely in my life, as a veteran Real Estate investor with over 23 properties, I found that I was hitting a wall with my Real Estate portfolio.The information alone starting on page 37... Fundamentals on why Real Estate goes up in value was brilliant, completely changed my thinking about the area and properties I have been purchasing.As well the section on How to Get the Bank to Yes!! was the most helpful in securing new mortgage funding.Once again thanks this book is a must for everyone from first time home buyers to serious players."
2,Pretty bad,"I used this book while working for 4 months in West Africa. I tried to use it to travel around Ghana and found it pretty much useless. Over half the book is cultural information and longwinded historical essays about the country. That's nice, but what I really wanted to know was how to get places, where to stay, is it safe, and how much does it cost. It's terrible at listing public transportation. It will tell that there is a bus from Accra to Cape Coast but doesn't say where to get it, how much it costs, a time estimate, or even give the name of more than one bus company (and the one they listed is far from the best one in Ghana). The only thing it does semi-well is listing options for lodging and restaurants.The guide also doesn't even cover Liberia or Ivory Coast. It's still better than Lonely Planet but that's only because Lonely Planet is so terrible."
3,They left out Liberia?,"Kinda lame, they just completely left out Liberia!?Will report back after I have a chance to use it in West Africa."
2,"American History and the ""olden days""- additional information for youngsters","This book was very good for showing my grandchildren what life was like in the olden days. Not as appreciated as I thought it would be by them, however, the book still managed to stimulate discussion about what it would have been like to live in a different time. This was quite valuable information to contrast with what children are exposed to on television and in the current world around them which must sometimes be a strange experience - no, we don't actually have spaceships or ray guns, etc.Grandaughter (9) and grandson (4) did not return to this book as much as others in the series of ""What was it like when ..... "". However, it was still a learning event in a fun way and more importantly, allows them to see and have explained to them very clearly and age appropriately, life from before their parents' (and yes! even their grandparents') were born."
5,a page-turning hysterical romp thru the bright side of NYC,"Elise Abrams Miller has written a fast paced, laugh-out-loud novel that represents the best of what chick-lit can be. This is a comedy, a romance and sharp tongued satire all at once. The characters are vivid, and charming, and the plot races along with plenty of fresh surprises at each turn. I couldn't recommend a book more highly-- this book is just plain fun."
5,Raving about Star Craving Mad!,"Because others had recommended it, I just read ""Star Craving Mad"" and was delighted to learn that I loved the book! It was a fast and amusing read (a great escape!), with wonderful characters and a surprising plot twist. I laughed out loud as I read the engaging dialogues, particulary the ones that the narrator has with herself. Its author, Elise Miller, brought an amusing glimpse to the angst of being single and 'star struck' in the Big Apple. I look forward to Elise's next novel!"
1,This book needs a negative one star rating,"If this is what Chit Lit is all about then NO Thanks! I'll stick with regualr romance where the characters are more sympathetic rather than pathetic, thanks very much."
3,Locking lever doesn't lock.,"When getting into tight spaces with this and you have to have the wrench locked, it always brushes up against something and gets unlocked. Not usable in those situations UNLESS you add some electrical tape to keep it from unlocking then it works as it should.The 14mm wrench was the only way I could get to the power steering pivot nut to turn it 1 turn which was all that was needed. My stubby wrench was just too short to get the needed leverage."
2,gearwrench locking flex,"I thought they would be really handy, but where the locking mechanism is located, (on each side at the joint) I think I will end up breaking it off from catching on whtever is next to the bolt I am taking out, I almost broke one off the first time I tried using one of them. I wish I could return them and get the reversible set before I break one.."
1,They really do not lock,"I bought this set along with the full metric ones. They feel sturdy but they do not at all stay locked when you apply even a little bit of force. Do not buy these unless you do not need the head to lock. I have had this issue with every wrench since I got them. At first I thought it was normal until I used a craftsman version of this tool. Spend a few dollars more and buy the craftsmans, those stay locked and look to be bullet proof."
4,Good details about SNMP V3,"I read the book, this is very good book to read about the SNMPV2 and SNMPV3. The table creation and deletion has been explained well. Has good information about the SNMPV3, VACM , User based Security model, SNMP Archietecture. The detailed description about the encrption and the algorithm used were though quiet unneccessary."
1,Worst Book Yet,"I had to buy this book as part of a Network Management class and have found it to be utterly useless during and afterwards. It is definatly the worse book that I have ever had to buy. First, it was mighty expensive for the quality of the writing/material. Second, the material within the book could have covered in a much better way. It was very difficult to understand because it travelled much to far into SNMP/RMON. I found it almost useless as a reference, because it did not cover anything in a way that was pertinant to actually using SNMP/RMON on a network. It lacked real world examples and uses. Perhaps this book would be great for someone who develops apps based on SNMP, but for someone who wants to learn about using it, its a massive waste of time."
2,"The SNMP part is okay, but RMON area lacks detail","The sections on SNMP are helpful, but if your looking for RMON info you should pass on this book. The author basically copies the RFC's verbatim and offers no more insight than the descriptions found in the Mibs themselves."
2,Not for Beginners,"Before buying this book my major objective was to 1. Learn about SNMP basics, 2. Learn about MIB and some advanced concepts of SNMP like interaction of the SNMP manager with the agent. 3. Learn programming techniques of SNMP. 4. See how MIB,agent,device,NMS all interact together.I feel that this book has not satisfied the above 4 points. In fact this book is not for beginners. If you are new to Network management and want to learn about SNMP the defacto standard of network management, then this book is not advisable. This books talks pretty much at a higher level about concepts rather than talking about the SNMP basics and then guiding u thro higher concepts.If u r looking for good SNMP material, the net is the good reference. Goto (...) and search for MIB,SNMP etc and then u r certain to hit very good pages."
3,Good for developpers - bad for systems administrators,"This book is deep down description of all the OIDs and structure of SNMP.If you want to know how the messages get through (SNMP get and other commands) in a developer's point of view, and you want a full dump of all the leafs and OIDs in the MIB structure, then this book is for you.If you are a systems administrator looking for a practical way to understand how to use SNMP to manage your network devices, then look elsewhere (Essential SNMP, for instance)."
3,The RFCs are clearer,"Not so clearly written (or typeset for that matter). It's also somewhat out-of-date ('96).I refer to it periodically, but find myself reading the RFC documents instead.Stallings misdescribes the ipNetToMedia table(p. 130, 137). He doesn't mention that it's equivalent to the ARP cache."
3,They need to rise up,Disciple definitely has a strong rocking sound with The Wait Is Over and Rise Up however after that it falls short. If you are happy with two good songs this album is for you the only thing is you will have to wade through numerous high pitched whining vocals mixed with deep dark instrumentals that never seem to match up or go anywhere. Download the two I mentioned the others you will never listen to. Hoping for them to rise up on their next album.
2,Getting more mainstream,"This disciple album is beginning to have a more mainstream ""80's rock"" sound. Alot of the songs sound the same with their guitar rhythms, and choruses. Many of the songs remind me of late 80's to early 90's hair band rip-offs. This album was downright boring, and could not keep my interest.Definitely not their most creative album to date. Disciple needs to start being more diverse with their music, and style. Sounds like they are starting to run out of musical ideas by sticking with their current style."
4,One of the better Christian releases in a long time,"I think this was a very good CD. Classic Disciple fans be warned there different. They used to be metal and sounded like Demon Hunter, Killswitch Engage, and Blood Has Been Shed, now there just hard rock like Shinedown, Audioslave, and Skillet. Personally I enjoy the change. They were just a above average metal band but there a great Hard Rock band. I think this was a very good CD but theres still room for improvement, but I'll give em' a break since its there first CD of this genre."
2,disappointed disciple fan,"i have been a disciple fan for years i have the preivous 4 cd,s and ep so i think i can give a honest assement of this cd.I totally agree with the reviewer below what has happened to disciple i don,t want to be negative but disciple just sound like a lot of other christian bands such as pillar etc.I just love the previous cd,s back again and by god where the music was awesome and the lyrics bold,and were not afraid to mention the word jesus in the songs instead of you.I know they want to reach out to a larger audience but at the price of sounding like other bands.Let,s hope they get back the heavier sound on the next cd a disappointed fan."
2,Disapointed Disciple Fan,I have to say that I am disapointed in this album and do not plan to buy it. Not only is it an extreme departure from their earlier sound but I am also disapointed in the lyrics. On their previous cd's you knew that they were singing about Jesus Christ our Lord. With what I have heard of this I am concerned that the band is only trying to catch onto the radio friendly craze and I am disapointed that they have lost faith in their message from the earlier cd's sound. I applauded their previous sound because it took real guts to make the honest stand that they were.
2,Not too great,"""The Everything Magic Book"" is not a best buy. It gives you some good information, but it is written quite poorly and it is VERY confusing. It is also for a very advanced magician, because you need to know all kinds of different methods of this and that...I do not recommend it to anyone who just wants to learn some fast, simple, but cool tricks."
3,"Great item, terrible company","After the experience with their service dept, I would recommend avoiding doing business with Wowzzers. They don't return messages, most of their contact info is a dead end, and shipping was outrageously expensive to boot.However, I did like the cards when I received them. They weren't quite what I imagined so I returned them after much hassle and runaround from Wowzzers."
3,"Better than commercial rap, but not Masters of Illusion","This album is okay, but the production is slow and novice. Ice T is cool, but this is not his best rapping. And Kool Kieth is much better on Dr. Octagon, and Masters of Illusion. Those albums also have better production. Analog Brothers sounds out of date."
1,The album doesn't deserve a star,"The CD sucks, badly. A waste of KOOL KEITH's time. ICE-T, please. He went out with BODY COUNT. The rest of the ANALOG BROTHERS, tell 'em Burger King's hiring."
1,bull%$##@,"i just bought this mp3 album and its the instrumental version yet each track warns ""explicit"". Apparently it's the same deal on itunes. Too bad b/c this album ios sick. Pissed."
5,YOYOYOYOYOYO REMIXES,Zajebiste remixy....ale jeszcze lepsze sa remixy nr.2.........totalny odjazd na 50centa....tak trzymac Busta!!!!!!!
1,Patriotic Review,"When I first saw this DVD I was pretty excited about the patriotic music and video that it has. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a very disappointing DVD. For the price that I paid for, I was expecting at least that all the songs in the DVD to be complete. ""America the beautiful"" and the ""Star Spangled Banner"" are both incomplete. The quality of the picture and the montage of the video is very poor.In short, I don't recommend this DVD to any patriotic person."
4,For the serious reader and writer,"Based on a series of lectures, this work is a grand insight into the structure and character of novels and novel writing. It delves into all aspects of the novel including, people, plot, pattern, story-line, etc. I found the lectures on people, pattern and rhythm, and prophecy especially insightful and revealing.Be forewarned, unless you are a serious writer or literary aficionado, these lectures will most likely be uninspiring. For the average reader, I would rate this book three stars. But if you are a serious writer or literary aficionado, this is a five star book that must possess a prominent and easily accessible place in your library."
2,<yawn>,"I've tried for the fourth time to read this book. For the fourth time, I had to give up half-way. This book is just too dense for my simple mind.I am sure that it contains more substance than most books on writing (hence, the generous two stars), but the packaging and, maybe, relevance compelled me, once more, to use the time I would on it to some other book more suitable for my Philistine tastes."
1,"Oh,Wow","Bought the album. Listened to the album.Taped the Strayhorn ""Flower"". Took the album to the second hand store and recovered some of my investment. The title of the album should be ""Songs I Did'nt Write, and Am Glad I Did'nt"".."
5,Excellent Choice,"I purchased this for the bathroom of our 30' travel trailer. RV travelers know that organization is key when storage, etc. is limited - ie. the bathrooms are not spacious. The rack is of sturdy construction which we need for hanging damp bath towels, etc.(especially during the fall/winter). Great for two+ RVers in the trailer! Love where my husband installed it - out of the way. It would be great for any room in a RV/home/dorm! It is sturdy enough for heavy items other than just coats, ie pots and pans. Super product for the price.Expandable Wooden Coat Rack"
3,Too Large for a small dog,"Even in the small size this pack was too large for my 17 pound Schnauzer/Poodle. Before purchasing I called the company to find out the lower end of size compatibility and was informed this pack would fit my dog. Their ad did not have a lower limit for dog sizes listed. I took up the straps by looping them back and sewing them down, thus making it work. But it would be better to have more information about size ranges. Otherwise it is a good pack and handy that you can take the pouches off without removing the entire pack."
5,Bought this for one song :),"I do that alot though. I finally got tired of not having ""A Gentle Heart"" so I snagged this while I could. AMG is a terrific series with beautiful and melodic themes (they're Goddesses so what do expect.) Any fan of the series will appritiate the gentle and soft themes. This CD also includes the on air version of ""Open Your Mind"" (by - Yoko Ishida) which is the opening theme. The full version can be found on her albums but I actually like the fuller and richer version at the beginning of the on air version better than the ablum version. One of these years I'll splice them together for the ultimate mix! Until then I'll listen to this CD any time I need to brighten my mood."
3,My prior review was for Sugar Roses -- not this one!,"I wrote a review for Sugar Roses (a book I said is OUTSTANDING) and they've put that review onto this book as well (Sugar Flowers for All Seasons). I've noticed they duplicated the reviews from others too. I have not looked Sugar Flowers for All Seasons so I can't say one way or the other if it's any good, (although considering the author, it's probably great)."
5,Pinch me!,"I still can't believe it's really happened. To make it even better, the episodes have been lovingly restored, with crisp pictures and non-hiss audio. I can't wait to watch the whole thing, extras as well.Thanks to Shout for making it real. They made a whole lot of us feel a lot less creepy!"
5,Great purchase,"If you do not own any of the individual seasons of this show, if nothing else, buy the complete series for the bonus disc that is included. It has interviews with cast members and just a really neat look at the background of the show. Mine was used and I recommend that route to get a better deal"
5,Eddie' Revenge,"Can't wait to get this. It was in the last four seasons that Eddie Haskell really became the snake that we all remember and love. All we need now is for the remaining seasons to be released for All in the Family, Beverly Hillbillies, and of course the one everybody is waiting for, BATMAN from the 60s."
4,A Great Collection,"Five stars on this set. It's great to have this complete series available. When ordering it I wasn't sure how good it would turn out to be. I am really pleased with it. Some other sets I've bought have presented problems, but not so with ""Leave It To Beaver."" I'm impressed with the sharpness of the picture and equally so with the sound. I don't even have to turn up the volume. The set is nicely packaged as well and very easy to use. In brief, I'm delighted with this set. Amazon is to be commended and kudos to those who designed it!"
5,Forever A Classic,I love everything about this series! The fun is watching Beaver grow up and yet maintain his adorable cheeky ways! A family classic!!! :)
5,A True Classic,"A friend reminded me of Leave it to Beaver, and she remarked how current the show is even for today's world. i bought the complete set for my family. My 13 year old LOVES it! We watch 3 episodes at a time AS A FAMILY."
1,not a beginner book,"While I found the book useful I would NOT recommend it to a beginner as it assumes you know how inductions & scripts work....and while it gives ideas & suggestions... It gives NO scripts or fundamentals. And while it touches on many topics, it covers none very well. The book lacks structure, focus and clear direction."
2,"Hard to use, but good information","This book has some wonderful information about self-hypnosis. In fact, as a textbook on the subject, I think it's excellent. But if you're planning on actually using the info for practical results, this isn't the best book. There are other books on self-hypnosis that have a more easy-to-follow approach to achieving your goals."
2,unstructured,"this book it's all over the place, it lacks structure, how are you suppose to follow the process of self hypnosis if there is no structure, this book should be re-edited."
3,Not as good as i expected,I bought this for my friend and had lot of expectations from this product. This is ok for the price i bought but is not that great.
3,This Is It!!! It is?,"Having a lot of good, international memories of Michael Jackson, I bought this with the assumption that I would get some full videos of his past performances. This did not happen....only sketches. That disappointed me. However, this is a good video for those who wish to go into the entertainment field to discover how a good performer gets that way...by practice, good ideas, precision, and in MJ's case, kindness to all who supported his endeavors. You don't have to be a monster of a boss to get results. (Supervisors, managers, directors, ceo's - take note)."
1,Stuck in the 80's,"The major problem facing the producers of THIS IS IT is the dearth of any recent hits by Jackson, meaning the songs performed here are all very dated and fail to engage the audience in any meaningful manner."
2,dr in the house,too bad he dired dr kildarethen we would have something betterjust say nosoes that make any sense anymore????
2,"Cheapest 2 GB USB stick, or used to be","For one, brief, shining moment, this was the cheapest 2 GB USB stick available on Amazon. Prime-eligible, low price...what's not to love? Best of all, I could use it as a USB boot drive, and thus I could use it to repair a friend's netbook. O, how she wailed when she saw me retract the foresk -- excuse me, the protective sleeve, and insert the tiny, white dingus into her formerly pristine computer. Ha ha!As for the movie, who knows. Personally, if they show a movie at MY funeral, the title had better not be ""This Is It"". That's a little on-the-nose for me. But if you want a USB drive with which to defile your computer, this might be a good choice.None of you are safe!"
1,This is it : terrible,"I bought this 2 disc version because I liked the HBO broadcast so much. Much to my disappointment, when we played the disc, it sounded horrible. It was very muffled and the sound was not crisp at all. It almost sounded like a 3rd or 4th generation recording. I thought maybe that my sound system was the problem, so I played the Lady GaGa DVD that I purchased on the same order and it sounded great. The only thing I can say is, I only paid $5.00 for this 2 disc pack. I should have known that you get what you pay for."
5,MUST HAVE,I SWEAR THIS MOVIE OR SHOLD I SAY MJ inspired me.... he is amazing... i absolutely loved it when I watch it in the opening night. He was such an artist in control.. you can learn so much from him.... RIP MJ
3,It's an interesting experience,"This isn't a concert. It's a collection of moments from the rehearsal of the tour M.J. was about to do before he passed on. The choreography and songs are amazing as you would expect. This also gives you a little insight into what M.J. was like on an average day; if you can call any of his days average. He is very gentle and soft spoken. Kind of surprising considering the intensity of the performances he gave. This is a great DVD loaded with classic tunes. Whether you are a casual M.J. fan or a long time follower, this is a fun experience!"
3,This is it.,I love Michael Jackson and was looking so much in seeing this film. Sorry but it was not what I expected. I think his death was one of the worlds biggest loses and I can not even think he will ever be replaced but the movie just does nothing for me. If you would like to see him put his last vidio togather then maybe you will like it. I was hoping for a movie. Anyway here is to Michael who rules but the movie did not.
5,THE BEST MOVIE OF 2009,"WHEN MICHAEL DIED IT BROKE MY HEART. I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM AND HIS MUSIC SINCE ""THRILLER"". THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME. IT SHOWS HOW INTO HIS SHOWS HE REALLY GOT. NOW I KNOW WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU NEVER SAY NO TO MICHAEL JACKSON. HE KNOWS HOW HE WANTS TO DO HIS SHOWS AND HIS MUSIC, AND THATS THE WAY IT IS. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MICHAEL JACKSON. HE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE KING OF POP. IF I DIDN'T LIKE ELVIS SO MUCH. I'D SAY MICHAEL WAS THE KING OF MUSIC. ANY MICHAEL FAN NEEDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE, AND MORE THAN ONCE."
5,MJ's Spirit Lives On!,"If you're still grieving over the King of Pop's untimely death, you have to see this movie! You can really feel his spirit, his sweetness, and his genius in this footage. R.I.P. Michael! We love you!"
5,See it in IMAX,"I saw THIS IS IT in IMAX and it was an absolute thrilling experience. The huge screen and over 30 surround sound speakers made you feel as though you were at a live concert. Tickets were $12. but worth it. At the end of our showing, movie goers continued to sit in their seats. No one wanted to leave the theater because we all felt the sadness of never seeing Michael in live concert again. Michael showed his genius behind the scenes by fine tuning musical notes and his choreography. You left the theater thinking Michael couldn't have been 50 years old the way he danced with his 20+ year old back-up dancers, who clearly idolized him. And you also left knowing how special Michael was and thanking GOD for allowing Michael to briefly visit with us."
4,MJ goes out a winner,"The thing about the movie is that there are not any real surprises- MJ probably wanted to play it ""safe"". He could be testing the waters to see the competition and have one last attempt at world domination,or just join the oldies, Vegas set and perform Billie Jean ad nauseum and get paid handsomely for it. Oh how fate has other plans. This movie could be described as MJ ""unplugged"". There are no safety nets,he dances brilliantly, he sings soulfully and indeed looks at the top of his game. This portrait could be as honest as you could get of MJ. We are peeking into his rehearsals and he really makes his co-workers punch above their weight. Its great watching him communicate to the band what he wants-he is a font of music and emotion and it just oozes out of him. When he does Billie Jean you get goose bumps.This movie once and for all shows what a true genius he was, what an amazing performer, what a loss and we will probably not see another like him again."
5,Esperando!!,"Genial, lo vi en el cine y nada que decir.Lo acabo de comprar xDPero por favor entreguen el disco pronto!!!!no pueden esperar a navidad!!!QUE LLEGUE YAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
5,LOVED IT!!!,"Amazing footage--the closest a true fan could come to such an amazing performer! I can not wait to buy this movie & I for one, am glad to say that I have no problem with my dollars going to the children left behind from this tragedy."
5,Beautiful Truth,"This film is an amazing look into the REAL Michael Jackson, showing the pure, sincere, musical genius at his heartfelt best. I can't tell you how many friends of mine have had their minds changed and negative opinions changed from seeing the real MJ and not following the media, tabloids, etc, over the past years that pushed MJ away from the USA. This incredible human being was a great gift to the world and I am so thankful we have this film showing him in his true light. I more than highly recommend it, and every single fan and pseudo-fan of The King of Pop should absolutely have this in their movie library.RIP MJ. We love you!"
3,it's okay,"This movie is a cultural ""must-see"": One interested in American Pop-culture should remain current on Michael Jacksons's curtain closing act. There are some semi-tear jerking moments, like in the beginning when the the dancers share their love for MJ.One of my favorite moments of the film was the highlight on the badass blond bombshell who simply knows how to rule the guitar. Of course I'm speaking of Orianthi Pangaris. This movie-in my opinion-launched her career. Surely, for Orianthi this is NOT it...I suppose I left the cinema a bit disappointed b/c I expected to see some family or personal commentary of the making of MJ's final tour. Alas, the film is more of a making-of documentary of Michael Jackson's This Is It tour."
4,Highly recommended,"On this video you can see Michael performing his rehearsal, but there is no difference between real show and rehearsal even though his dancers were singing and clapping for a while."
5,Wonderfull,I loved to receive my Data Traveler with This is It movie..!as a Michael Jackson fan .. this is a jewel for me to have it always with me wherever I go..
5,simplemente el mejor,"Tuve la oportunidad de ver la pelicula en el cine, y es grandioso. Se puede ver a un Michael sencillo y amoroso y despliega su enorme talento en los ensayos. Se puede ver el Michael exigente en su trabajo y perfeccionista. Que pena que tan siquiera no dio ni el primer concierto. Este concierto iba a ser el mas grande y mejor en la historia de la musica. Lo recomiendo a todos."
5,"""This is It"" proves to the WORLD Michael was a Musical GENIUS","After seeing ""This is it"" last night,I keep on thinking about it.Michael Jackson was amazing,a Musical Genius,and will live on FOREVER.His dancing and singing were perfection,and he was saving his best for the real shows.I can only imagine what they would have been like,but thank GOD we have ""This is It"" to remember Michael forever."""
4,Just what we expected,Received the DVD in three days and were pleased with the behind the scenes documentary.
5,Awesome purchase!,I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson. I loved this show. I am so glad they taped this before he passed away. He was an amazing talent. Even my grand children liked the show.
2,Not what it was in the theatre,This movie was excellent at the theatre in IMAX but loses it's magic on the small screen. Sound quality is horrible - it goes up and down in waves throughout the movie. I would not recommend purchasing...
2,Wasn't what I expected.,"I was excited to find this DVD at Amazon before it hit the stores, but not a week after I recieved my order, the same DVD was at Wal-mart for the same price with 2 disc not just one. So I was alittle disappointed. I may check the store prices before ordering again."
3,That Was It......?,"It was nice 2 see Michael Jackson practicing the song and dance that made him famous, but u also get 2 see all the peepz around him that had to kiss his royal behind just 2 appease ""the man"". It was sort of disgusting to see all his dancers and the ""tour manager""? just bow down to his feet. I guess that goes hand and hand in the entertainment field, the kissing of bootie, all about the $$$. Most of the performances were gr8, but I had 2 fast forward some of the content towards the end, it just went on 4 2 long. By they time they got 2 Beat It, I was sort of done, I got the picture. I'm sure the dancers were completley devastated by his passing, knowing they went thru all that 4 nothing. But they seemed super phony anywayz so I didn't care either way. I still think Prince is a better overall entertainer than Michael jackson. He never seems 2 garnish any respect like MIchael Jackson, even tho he's a MUSICIAN."
3,Nice!,Nice DVD with some great moments in preperation of the concert. The movie shows what the show was all about and gives you a small experience of experiencing Michael Jackson up close and personal.
5,MJ is IT.,"My wife and I enjoyed watching this talented young man sing and dance and put every ounce of energy he had into his performances, even though they were rehearsals. Michael Jackson has always required from himself and those around him to give 100% of their creative energy to his projects even to the smallest detail. This documentary was a showcase to his inner soul, thanks from a new fan."
5,A Combination of Concert and Inspiration on my Home TV!,"Michael Jackson: This Is It on Blu-ray disk is a great deal. When the movie first came out, it was pretty expensive, and now is very reasonable. I found it from a review on imagine123 dot com/movies and am so glad I bought it on Amazon. This movie is like a combination of concert and inspiration but on my home TV!"
5,Loved it (and hated it),"I was a fan of Michael Jackson from the time he sang with his brothers. I watched his career all my life. ""This is it"" shows how brilliant Michael was and what a performer he was. It amazed me to watch how much energy he put into each performance even though it was just ""dress rehearsal"". His voice is not as strong as it was in years past but I feel that the reason was that this was just a rehearsal. You can see what a perfectionist he was because he wanted to make sure every note and step showed what he wanted the audience to see. I loved watching Michael doing what he did best--performing.The reason I hated it is the fact that we will never see him do this again. What a loss to the entertainment industry. Have tissues handy when watching the DVD because the realization comes to you that this really is it for Michael Jackson."
5,He was amazing.,"What a great glimpse into the life of a man no one knew but everyone talked about. He was an extraordinary person and it is shown plain as day here by his friends and associates. RIP, MJ."
5,Excellent Concert Film,"Tell me what has become of my lifeI have a wife and two children who love meI am the victim of police brutalityI'm tired of bein' the victim of hateYou're rapin' me of my prideOh, for God's sakeI look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...Set me free- Amazing film that showcases an amazingly talented and charitable human being. I highly recommend this concert movie to anyone that grew up with or would like to discover Jackson's most famous compositions."
5,The best that ever did it.,"Michael Jackson was a creative genius who lived before his time. He took music and entertainment to such a place of depth, that it touched you personally and moved you to want to be better. Only God knows why we had to lose him so soon. Gone, but NEVER EVER forgotten. At least not by me...."
3,Ok,It was okay. No big deal.....not really well connected. The DVD arrived on time and in good shape. That's it.
4,really good condition,I bought this DVD used with no expectations. It was like new. The DVD was in excellent condition. Thanks and I will be looking for you again.
3,it is what it is...,"...play on words jokingly for a Just ok, behind scenes pre-concert prep stuff; dont have more to say about it, @ least for right now.(i generally like j5 & especially mj-some music & vids of his; of course they both also have good, timeless music between them.)"
1,Music DVD,REALLY WANTED THIS DVD BUT IT WOULD NOT PLAY ON ANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS.THE SELLERS WERE VERY NICE THOUGH AND GAVE ME AN IMMEDIATE REFUND.I WOULD PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SO NICE.
1,"This is it, except for the money grubbing Jackson family","The man was a great performer, but this is just another sad example of a family and friends making money of him now that he is gone. The Jackson family cares about money and not Michael."
1,Pure hype...nothing else.,It was a 'behind the scenes' of what could've been. Michael Jackson was entertaining to watch. His songs were hits. That's it. People claiming Michael Jackson was a life-changing force must consider looking at themselves first. It doesn't help that people are so quick jump on the band wagon and deify him.Michael Jackson was just a guy doing what he enjoyed.
1,"You Know it's Bad, Shamon, Really, Really Bad","Another sad example of selling even the dead, a rehearsal sold as a great show. He was an above average dancer and singer (not a great voice compared, lets say to Marvin Gay or Stevie Wonder), with a rather limited production of true hits, the Beatles for example wrote, produced and hatched 20 albums from 1964 to 1969. NOBODY WROTE FOR THEM. Save your money. These are old songs rehashed and not as cool as the old videos - maybe the ""producers"" should concentrate on a true remastered compilation of those on true HD picture and audio. Don't get me wrong he did a few good songs, but the amount was truly scanty compared to others in the same amount of time."
1,Shame Amazon,"I bought this blue ray.Unfortunatly i see this blue ray doesn't work.Amazon don't say this blue ray work only for Region A.So this BD it is not compatible with my blue ray player.Please Amazon offer clients real information about DVD,BD...Why say this blue ray it is compatible for Region 1? Shame Amazon...:("
1,Not as good as seeing him live.,"I've seen him live and this was just ok. Not worth the money and not worth supporting his legal trust!Try to find a free boot leg of a concert some where and you'll get a better ""tear"" jerking experience.I only cried when i heard how much it cost.(got it as a present.) And ended up selling it for more than that. :-) (BONUS!)Don't waste you're money, rent it."
1,Congratulations!,"Everyone that paid to see this movie is a winner of the coveted ""Help Michael's greedy friends and all of the rich folks capitalize off of his death/possible murder"" Award!!! In showing your financial support of this vile situation, you've helped support the people who helped to mold him into a the freak that he became. There's nothing wrong with wanting to see the movie, but giving people that cruel and greedy your hard-earned cash is a crime in and of itself."
3,This Is It,"The picture was not very clear. I went to the movies to see This is It, the video did not do the movie justice"
5,Miss MJ more than ever...,"Absolutely, beautifully done. Fortunately ""This Is It"" DVD captures the essence & passion of Michael Jackson, performers, producers preparing for tour. It is difficult not to be emotional in my review about how I am left after seeing this DVD and what MJ was creating.After seeing this documentary the appreciation I feel for having been here while he was on this planet, now grows daily. I was moved and inspired by what he created around himself and for others. Wow. This is a story about a pinnacle event for all in collaboration with Michael jackson for his tour and it makes me wonder what life is now like for those individuals. Michael created team players and they all won. 'It', the tour, did not happen, (too bad) and 'it' did happen- the embodiment of Alan Watts novel ""This is it"". ""This is it"" is unfortunately, it, the last time he would be filmed and I can not be anything but sad about that."
2,SERIAL CODE DOESN'T WORK,"I was going to use the USB and watch the video on my computer and it asked me for a SERIAL CODE i tried the one on the product and it did not work . It's frustrating that i couldn't watch the video , i just got a normal usb with a fancy cover That's it!"
5,"Simply astonishing,the ultimate video masterpiece","Forget about stars this is beyond the scale of basic 5 stars,THIS IS IT represents the universe of excellence.He was and always will be the greatest artist performer ever touch the face of this earth.A masterpice of epic scale superb picture and sound the only Blu-Ray disc worth buying especially when one consider the rediculous price.This disc will be at the top of your video food chain..enjoy with care."
5,Amazing Talent,"Filled with great music, choreography and oozing with talent, this video highlights the gifts that Michael Jackson shared with us in his lifetime. Whether or not your a Michael fan, you'll enjoy ""This is It"" for what it is, terrific and moving entertainment."
5,Well worth the money! This IS it!,"This is an amazing collection of clips from his rehearsals for the tour. The extras are great. The sound quality is amazing and it is a visual feast. If you loved Michael you will want this. It is wonderful to see the man in action and to show the world what a kind, funny and loving person he was. I only wish there were more clips. Unfortunately - for us all - This IS it... and it leaves you wanting more. Just as wonderful at home as it was in the theater. Kudos to those responsible for sharing it with us."
5,MJ The real king of pop FOREVER!,Any word that can express in this way falls short of MJ have demonstrated quality in both their personal life was a true artist. Certainly there has never been and I doubt there is anyone with such talent and humanity. Michael FOREVER!
3,"Eh, I'd rather have the albums these songs are from.","There's really only one song worth buying this cd for, otherwise just get his albums which are much better. I guess this is for people new to Michael, but I'm sure all his diehard fans that have everything he's ever made are buying this one as well when they don't really need it."
1,Fake Video And Fake Sound,"Most of the scenes have a Michael impersonator and the singing does not sound like him at all to me. Like the recording his doctor made of Michael that they played in court, Michael could not make sense talking and he sure could not sing close to the end. By not making this video they could have left previous videos of Michael shine so that the terrible video This Is It! would not shatter anybody's great memory of Michael."
1,Digitial rights ruins product,"This item requires that you enter a digital rights code that is printed on the package. With its printing, in my case it was impossible to read. Item is now nothing more than overpriced USB flash drive."
4,Good Movie,"I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson and of course got the dvd. It was good to see him in action behind the scenes and to see how respectful as a leader in the rehearsals. The only thing I wish for is that one day they would and had hoped with this dvd that his 3-D short films are released as 3-D. When I went to the movie threatre to watch it I was like, ""Man that would have been so cool in 3-D!"" This dvd give you a rare glimpse of Michael and how involved he was with his concerts."
5,Michael Jackson will be missed forever,"This goes to show how amazing Michael Jackson still was. I went to see this 3 times in the cinema and have watched it more times than that since I purchased the dvd, it's brilliant and a great tribute to have and shows how brilliant the 'This Is It' tour would have been. It's a must have for everyone, not just fans, to show the brilliance of Michael Jackson."
5,Can't Stop Loving You!,Excellent...can't get enough...Brings tears to my eyes everytime I watch it.I can't believe he still sounded the same...Do not hesitate to buy.
3,A must for jacks fans,"I bought this as a gift for a fan of bad and thriller, they loved. I've watched a bit too , event though I'm not a jacko fan it's still very entertaining."
3,Okay,"I was always a big Michael Jackson fan, but I really wasn't crazy about this movie. It was okay, but didn't live up to all the hype for me."
5,Greatest Man that ever lived,"I watched the ""This is it"" movie yesterday and i can't express how it made me happy and thrilled cause i knew this person i watched dancing, singing, mentoring is the real MJ.And not that person that the media pictured as a molester and abnormal man, heart aching though..........MJ left us all,what a huge loss.What you will see is a miracle, a man in his 50s outperforming everyone and same time a great teamwork player.His love,respect and patience for the people around him is very obvious and mutual.I am praying to god everyday that MJ would be some where better, i will always love you."
5,2 Discs are better than 1 - it's MJ,"I loved this movie all 18 times I saw it at the cinema during its limited run, and I have seen the single disc edition of the DVD. The advantage with this 2-disc edition is the additional behind the scenes extras you get on the second disc, which focus on the dancers and musicians that were a part of Michael Jackson's This Is It show. The Unfinished Rehearsals segment is a real treat, as it provides our first glimpse of the staging for ""Dirty Diana"" which was never rehearsed to the same level as the songs that we see Michael performing in the movie.For MJ fans, two discs are definitely better than one. I just wish that the other extras that are only available on the Blu-Ray version [ASIN:B002UD56I6 Michael Jackson: This Is It [Blu-ray]]could have been included on this double DVD set as well. So... I'll just have to invest in a Blu-Ray player!"
5,BUY THIS DVD NOW!!!,"DO NOT HESITATE!! BUY THIS DVD RIGHT THIS MINUTE!! A RARE GLIMPSE OF TRUE GENIUS - HONEST AND UNFILTERED!!! DO IT!!! RIGHT NOW, DAMNIT!!!!!!"
5,THIS IS IT!,"Alright, Finally the Michael Jackson film we have all been waiting for.Songs that are in the film:""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'""""Speechless""""Bad""""Smooth Criminal""""Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough""""Jam""""They Don't Care About Us""""HIStory""""The Way You Make Me Feel""""I'll Be There""""Human Nature""""I Want You Back""""The Love You Save""""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)""""I Just Can't Stop Loving You""""Thriller""""Threatened""""Who Is It""""Beat It""""Black or White""""Earth Song""""Billie Jean""""Man in the Mirror""""This Is It""The film will feature the ""behind the scenes"" of MJ performing his legendary dance moves one last time. From the promo clips we have all seen from the film, he looking very good for his age. The film is 112 minutes long. The dvd will be out in time for Christmas, that's why its only running for 2 weeks.R.I.P. MICHAEL JACKSON ""KING OF POP"""
3,This is it...really?,"I've been a Michael Jackson fan since I can remember. My first album bought was Thriller. When Michael died, it was like I lost a piece of myself. I was excited to learn they would release Michael's preps for the THIS IS IT concerts as a movie/dvd.It felt like I'd have a little piece of magic...the magic of the last moments Michael spent dreaming, creating, and being himself. Instead, when I viewed THIS IS IT, I got something different. Michael was in TOP form, don't get me wrong...it just lacked when it came to moments with him. I wanted more. I guess it just wasn't ENOUGH to satisfy someone who grew up loving and watching him. I felt a little disappointed with THIS IS IT. However, I will say, Michael's vision for the concerts...SUPERB! He was so creative and talented. There is NO DOUBT in my mind that if he had lived, THIS IS IT would have been the BEST concert EVER. Instead, THIS IS IT is bittersweet at best. A dream never coming true...an icon lost way to soon."
3,OK,"I bought this on sale over the holidays. It was decent, but I guess I was expecting more out of it in terms of telling the story of ""This Is It"" and I expected more performances to listen to on my home theater sound system. It's just OK in my opinion."
5,This Is It Video,Excellent value for blu-ray disc! Product arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The video itself is great! Michael Jackson was a genious in the preparations and directions for this documentary.
4,Gone too soon.,"Michael Jackson's This Is It is an interesting look of the final months of the King of Pop's life. Michael Jackson's personal life wasn't always picture perfect but his iconic music forever lives on. I was really surprised how well Michael's singing and dancing ability was before his untimely death. He is very frail and appears drained at times but his voice and famous moves were still intact. I really enjoyed the rehearsal footage of They Don't Really Care About Us, Human Nature, Thriller, Black or White, and Billie Jean. Kenny Ortega did a great job on this documentary. Check this DVD out sometime!"
5,I love it,I loved it I love micheal jackson he is this the king of pop. I just love him. I miss you micheal. :(
5,Experience Michael Jackson's Last Concert,"This Is It is more than a concert. It gives a feel for what his last concert might have been like, but it also takes you through a bit of the creative process for each performance that was being created. It gets to the heart of what Michael was like at work. You walk away with the feeling that you really know a little bit more about what Michael was like, not just what you've been blasted with by the media. You meet some of the finest dancers in the world. You see ground breaking special effects that have never been used in a concert before and it makes you wonder who will now be the first to incorporate these things into a live show since Michael didn't have the opportunity to share them while he was alive. It is great to see Michael Jackson, not at the end of his career, but at the top of his game. One of the great movies of 2009 even if the Academy didn't include it among their considerations as a nominee."
5,MJ This is IT,"This DVD is so special and I am thrilled I bought it because it made me laugh and cry. M J as he is known on this tour was/is in top form.I feel so sorry for the artists that rehearsed so long and hard then did not get to open the show. BUT these artists will remember MJ and rehearsals for the rest of their lives, not just for the time spent with him but now they have this special DVD. Everyone (onstage with him) loved him it is obviousIF you are thinking of buying this and cannot decide Do It!Michael I had forgotten you before seeing this dvd, but your light NEVER dimmed... YOU are the best and no one can top you as far as talent, being a wonderful caring human being and loving the Planet :-)>barbara"
3,Careful,"I'll put this simply: if you are what we in the art world call ""artsy-fartsy,"" you will enjoy this book, as the writing is poetic and full of descriptive emotion. But if you're just looking for a good read, pass this one on by. It will confuse the living daylights out of you. But if you must, do some back ground work on the author and maybe a little on the subject herself. Good luck!"
1,"Do Not Buy It: BAD Support, Expensive Lenses, Not Repair Services Available","* No answer to the e-mails for questions regretting repair solutions.* No Repair services near country(El Salvador or Central America)....and very limited access in countries like Panama, Mexico, and Colombia* Very Expensive Lenses and accessories compare to the Big Brands Like Canon or Nikon(at least for equivalent lenses like: SIGMA, TOKINA and others)I'd recommend to buy only the best known brands like Canon or Nikon, this 2 brands has representatives sellers all over Central America, and is easy to get spare parts and repair solutions for your cameras."
3,Try before you buy,"I almost bought this one. Great price for the features, but then I went to bestbuy and played with one. Disappointing, not like the canons and nikons to hold and feel, and live view wasnt attractive anymore.....The sony dslrs look and feel the best. So goto the storeand try one before you buy."
4,Back to the old SLR days,"I bought this camera after using a Olympus SP 500UZ which I liked very much. I did have problems getting focused zoom pictures and, since my eyes are not the youngest anymore, the preview screen is hard to see, especially in bright light. Well, here comes through the Lens viewing and I am happy as a lark. Makes me wonder why I gave up the 35mm Camera! I love the Image Stabilizer and the many shortcut functions. Two things that are minor is the function button which is right there where you grab the camera and it gets pushed by accident. The other is the manual which could be laid out differntly but this is minor since every new car comes nowadays with a 3 inch book. All in all I am very happy with this Product."
5,Best in its class - Almost!,"Very happy with this camera. It has just about all the features you could want; In-body Image Stabilization, Oly's proven dust reduction system, large view screen, live view, 10mp sensor, good performance at high ISO etc etc.Perhaps the only issue at present is that the white balance can sometimes be off on some images... not all. Hopefully this will be fixed soon in a firmware update?Apart from this, Olympus definitely have the best digital lenses of any brand and this camer has taken some awesome photos for me. I would buy another over the competing Canon and Nikon cameras in the same price range!"
4,Olympus e510 review,"Fantastic camera. vibrant colors. Flash strobe can get annoying when on auto focus, but that's easily looked passed with the photo you'll get."
4,nice camera,"Enjoying my camera. Although most people in the photography class I'm in have either Canon or Nikon cameras, I can still follow along."
4,"hmm, overall very good",just use it for a short time. overall is very good and worth the money and it would be much better if the focus system is as fast as cannon's.
3,"I had high hopes, but was dissapointed","1. After doing a lot of research on various DSLRs, I decided to get the Olympus 510. I was so sure that this would be a great camera that I also got the 2 kit lens deal along with an additional 11-22mm wide angle lens.2. This is a nice camera and should do the job for most folks.3. The reason I ended up returning this camera was because of the slight decreased dynamic range. The JPEG images are just overtly too contrasty (I'm sure that you can adjust the parameters in the menus), but even RAW files have decreased dynamic range compared to other DSLRs--> which is really a deal breaker for me since I shoot mainly landscapes, esp mountains with a lot of snow etc...4. If you just want an nicely made, compact DSLR for average shooting-> this would be a nice buy. But if your photography requires more than less dynamic range--> search elsewhere."
5,Very Happy With This Camera!,"I recieved my Olympus E510 a couple of days ago and I am very happy with it. I looked at several cameras from Nikon and Canon but decided the Olympus E510 was the better deal because it comes with two lenses. Buy one, you won't be disappointed!Ken GordonFairbanks, AlaskaAugust 5th, 2008I've had this camera since March and I'm still happy with it. For the price I don't think you can find another camera that comes close to the Olympus E-510. Also, in case anyone out was wondering, this camera works great at -40 degrees F.Ken GordonFairbanks, Alaska"
4,I'm happy with my Olympus Evolt 510,"After a month of having this camera, i'm very happy with it. I bought the 2 lens kit. Both lenses work really well and the images are super sharp. I haven't really used all the settings yet but the auto function works pretty well. The live view can sometimes give you a blurry result but i'd rather use the view finder. The only complaint i have is that now that i have the camera i want more lenses and the choices are slim compared to Nikon and Canon. Otherwise it's a great product."
5,MAGNIFICENT Product,"I was scouring the Nikon(D40x,D80) and Canon Rebels(E350D,400D) but was unable to find a camera that gave beautiful and natural images. I stayed away from the Olympus initially because it was ""Made In China"", and so did not look into it.Finally I went back to the Olympus E-510 and fell for it completely. Solid Build, Superb Pictures, Excellent Battery Life and Live View is a boon, just to mention a few...After 400 plus shots(70% with Flash), the Battery is still strong !!!This is my first SLR, and I am glad I bought it.The Zuiko lens is Amazing.To sum up, the only negative point I found in this Camera, was the Photographer ( Me :-) )I've printed the pictures and it looks like a Pro's job.Test and See...Goodluck!"
4,"Great camera, won't be disappointed!","Bought this as my beginner SLR and I must say, its been great. Even my wife who before we got it said ""I'll stick to my point & shoot camera"", has now been using it and loves it. Takes great pictures, easy to learn control's, should last us a long time! Also got a Tamrac 5767 Velocity 7x bag and it holds all the accessories/lenses perfectly!"
5,Olympus EVolt E510 - Great Buy!,"I love this camera. It does everything I wanted in an SLR camera and at a good price. I'm still learning how to use it, but I got great pictures right out of the box."
5,A real winner from Olympus,"Here are my initial thoughts on this Olympus. The E510 makes its predecessor (the E500) proud. This camera will definitely keep the DSLR competition honest and only benefit us consumers! I am thrilled to-date. (3 days with it)PROS* Image Stabilization* Great Construction, feels well made* Light weight (lighter than my friend's Pentax K100)* Phenomenal Kit Lenses* Lightning fast AF with 2 very good & light Zuiko kit lenses* Image quality, lower noise at higher ISOs* Great battery life (500+ photos in mixed shooting conditions)* Image sensor dust removal (at bootup)* Both CF and xD cardsCONS* Not a con, but Live View is quirky. When I use a DSLR I prefer to use the viewer, but I can see how some folks would LOVE to use the LCD. Its more of personal thing and if you dont want to use the LCD you just don't.* No others yet"
4,olympus E510,"Good camera. Nice small size, not to big/small. I wear glasses and the viewfinder is not in focus for me, also bifocals...overall is a nice camera. I have used Olympus before, OM-1. Cost was great from Amazon...also bought spare battery. I only gave 4 stars for the eyeglass problem."
5,Fantastic DSLR,"I have had the Olympus Evolt E510 10MP Digital SLR Camera with CCD Shift Image Stabilization and 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Zuiko Lenses for 4 weeks now. It has surpassed all my expectations. I purchased the Evolt E-500 dslr last year and it too is a great camera. When I purchased the E-510 I got the two lens kit. (14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Zuiko Lenses) The two lenses are a lot sharper and smaller in size than the kit lenses that came with the Olympus E-500. Another plus was the CCD Shift Image Stabilization system. Being that it is in the camera body and not in the lenses, I now have image stabilization in any lens I may mount. Overall, I rate it a 5 star camera system. I have hand held the camera and have taken photos at 1/8 second with great clarity. The ISO range is from 100 to 1600. The noise level at ISO 1600 is very good."
5,Great and cheap!,"This is a very good watch! Beautiful, very light and very cheap! The features of moon fase and age are useful or at least a nice curiosity feature to have on your pulse."
3,"JOSEPH LOSEY, OPUS 9","A lot of mirrors in this adaptation of a stage play. I must confess that the idea of an investigation made by a man who's drunk half the time is original and that Michael Redgrave deserved the BAFTA nomination he earned for his performance. I also liked a lot the hysterical behaviour of Leo McKern. in short, it's a kind of 24 Hours shot more than 50 years ago. Cinema always arises from its own ashes. Recommended."
4,Byronists and Techies will enjoy the modern romantic twist.,"Amanda Prantera has cleverly brought one of the greatest romantics of all time to life through a medium which is considered anything but romantic. This extremely entertaining tale begins with a research group who, on hopes of creating artificial intelligence, program all known data concerning Lord Byron into a computer. What follows is a charming glimpse into the reawakened mind of Lord Byron as we watch him dodge personal questions and woo Anna, a young researcher.Very, very clever!"
5,The Reviews are True,"This comb is awesome. It's sturdy and it seriously helps to get the lice and nits out. I hope I don't ever have to use it again, but I'm glad to have it."
4,Very usable,"This Lice comb is very easy to use,does the job quickly and easily,if I have a single complaint it is hard to clean where the tines join the handle but a toothpick and running water seem to do the job.The handle makes it a little easier to grip for people with problem hands.Thank youFairy Tales Terminator Lice & Nit Comb 1 ea"
5,Best Lice Comb,There is a difference with the lice combs that come with OTC products and this once. It is wider and catches more lice and nits.
5,Beyond expectations,"A number of previous reviews talked about problems utilizing the comb. Having used this as a 3rd attempt, I can say that even with very thick hair on young girls, this was an amazing, amazing product. I'm indebted to the Health Department nurse who recommended it."
5,Best lice comb on the market,"After trying nearly everything, this was the only lice comb that truly got rid of the nits in my daughter's hair. The unique design- with small ridges- removed all of them effectively."
3,my kids hair still too thin,"This really is a great comb and much better than you get in the box from OTC shampoo, but my kids have very fine hair, and this comb still did nothing for the nits. I still had to ""hand pick"" out any nits I found."
5,Unbelievably efficient lice comb!,"Let me first state that this was my first incident with lice and was completely freaked out when my daughter got it. I immediately looked up home remedies and used olive oil, coconut conditioner (which smothers nits and lice) and cut hair with nits. No joke, I spent HOURS picking through her hair. Thank God it was short hair! I ordered the comb with 2 day shipping and that is the only negative. I needed it ASAP! But once it arrived, it was a Godsend. I am very detailed and worked her hair over and over before the comb arrived. I didn't think there would be many left and the school nurse even checked her. Well, I started using the comb and SO many more nits came out! It was amazing. The instructions say to rinse after each comb through with nits but I just used a micro-fiber towel and that worked well. That was it, no more lice! Best $7 I have ever spent!"
5,lice comb,"I work in a school and I have children. Every home needs one! If you have children/teens, just spot check their heads every two weeks or so with this. This is THE BEST comb ever."
1,Save your money,Not worth the money. 11 dollars is too much for this simple item. you can buy better nit removal combs from Walgreens for a lower price!
5,3rd time's a charm - best comb by far...just buy it,"I can't say enough about this. Needless to say this has been a horrible time. Our son 4.5 brought lice home from school about a week ago. We first tried NIX otc kit (which comes w/ a plastic comb). We thought we were done until combing that night we realized there were about 50 eggs on our sons head. We also have twin 2.5 year old girls that both had eggs as well. Next we went to the pediatrician and bought the prescription creme which seemed to kill all the adults, but we still had eggs. We used a metal comb we bought at the local drugstore, but it hurt when it touched the scalp, tangled the hair (so you had to use small amounts at once) and took forever (not cool w/ the toddler crowd - :( ) Finally we overnighted 3 of these combs and we can't say enough. They work, they don't hurt and they go through the hair smoothly. Took half the time. Really, buy these first, don't mess with the OTC stuff, but mostly get this comb!!"
1,Did not remove nits,"This product did not work for my family. I really hoped it would. I used it on a section of my daughter's hair were I saw a couple nits. After several passes the comb pulled out a few hairs, but no nits. I have tried many combs and solutions to get rid of lice and nits over the past year. In the end, using my eyes and fingernails is still the best way to remove the pesky nits."
2,more damage than good,"I got the Rid kit and this comb. I saw a nit on my daughters hair (this is the white egg on the hair itself) and ran the comb through it and the nit was still there. Did this several times and the nit was still there. This comb did NOT remove nits. It was able to get the dead bugs out but so did the Rid comb, but maybe this got out more. I think the Rid comb that comes with the kit is less harmful on the hair itself. Is the damage to the hair worth the extra dead bugs? I'm not sure. The Rid comb was getting the dead bugs out too and not harming the hair nearly as much. Not sure what the other reviewers are raving about."
5,Great product!,"This comb worked really well! It is more rounded than the one we had been using so it did not ""stab"" while working it through the hair. It is a must have for all families who are exposed to head lice! I will keep mine in the freezer and continue to do periodic head checks to prevent reoccurances."
4,Nice comb,"This is a nice sturdy comb that will last many years. I work in a residential setting with children that sometimes get lice. I decided to buy my own comb because the ones they provide (SO many different types) are just annoying to use.Best features: GRIP. The grip is so nice. This thing won't fly out of your hand or break. Solidly constructed.With that said, there is nothing magical about this comb! You need a lot of elbow grease just like with any other. I don't think it kills the lice or ""terminates"" them. I don't think the jagged teeth destroy the nits like the product claims. You just have to comb them OUT with conditioner and then drown them in a bowl of water."
5,MUST HAVE!,You will not successfully conquer lice without this comb! I was blown away with what this comb took out of my sons hair the first time he came home with lice. The store bought combs are a waste of your money. I like to keep a small container of water next to me when I use it. I dip the comb in the water after EVER swipe through the hair to see what the comb has collected. It's an eye opener the first time you use it!!! NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS COMB!
3,Lice URG...,My 5 year old daughter got lice from school. And she has really long thick hair but each strand of hair is thin...it doesn't make much sense. This is the only comb that got the nits out. We still went through and picked the nits out by hand too but this helped. I still spray the spray in her hair before she goes to school.
1,Please beware,This is a knock-off. The product that came in the mail is in a different packaging than the one being advertised. The actual product says 'Ladybugs' and nowhere does the product say 'Terminator' which is the product I thought I was purchasing.The knock-off might work as well as the real thing but this is a blatant bait and switch. I can't believe Amazon allows this to happen and this will give me pause on future purchases from Amazon.
5,It's the (lice) BOMB,"Okay, we all know it is totally discombobulating to get the phone call that our precious, CLEAN, sweet kid has LICE! Well, let's face it, those nasty little buggers are around and the BEST weapon against them is the TERMINATOR nit comb. My husband and I dropped almost $400 on organic delousing for our whole family and they were willing to sell us ALL of their products EXCEPT for the lice comb! Need I say more? Just get the comb, some good tea tree shampoo and conditioner and you're home free. I put the conditioner in a spray bottle mixed w/water, spray it on my son's head and then run the comb through for 7 days - Viola! NO MORE LICE! It's all in the comb my friends!"
3,Works...Okay,"This product is NOT as great as everyone is saying it is. If you child has fine hair, then often times, the comb will roll right over the eggs. The solution-- there is none (at least that I have found) over then good old fashion hands and a pair a sharp eyes. This comb does however pull out SOME eggs, and most of the live bugs. The down side is, the bugs dont stick to the comb at all so sometimes when you comb through the bugs fall on the floor... not good. There is a comb that I really like however. It is an electric comb and zaps the bugs dead as soon as they touch the metal. This comb works wonders!!! I highly recommend it! Just keep in mind that none of these comb out all of the eggs so you need to use the comb for at least two weeks daily to make sure you get out any newly hatched bugs."
5,PERFECT,This comb was SO much better than the ones that come with the other lice shampoos. No question. The teeth are so close together that you don't miss a nit. Highly recommended.
4,"Works, but arrived RUSTY!","This comb is definitely superior to the combs that come with the lice treatment kits and I based my purchase on the good reviews.It removed two additional nits after I had already done a thorough job with the other kit comb. However, there was rust on the back side of the Terminator comb, in the tiny holes on the handle.Given my situation, I didn't have time to send it back so I have used it, anyways, but I hope that the seller reads this and sends me a new one! For $10, it should not arrive with rust."
2,Does Not Get Nits Out of Fine Hair,"We were excited to try this comb, but found that it pulled out much more hair than the other nit combs we have. We could have handled that if it actually worked, but with my daughters' fine hair, the nits just stuck tight and slid right between the tines of the comb as we tried to get them out. We have yet to find a nit comb that can hold on to the nits and actually drag them off the hair shaft. This comb works fine for parting small sections of hair to look for the nits (just like any other comb), but is completely ineffective for removing nits if you are dealing with fine hair."
4,"Very effective, easy to use, durable","Highly recommended, much better than the kind that comes within the lice shampoo boxes. Saved us a huge amount of hassle!"
5,Terminator Nit Free Comb,"The ONLY comb to use when removing nits and lice! Really effective and time-saving! Sturdy, easy to clean and rust-proof."
5,Great!,Thank you for fast shipping. Product is wonderful.We were panicking when we found lice and eggs on our son's head.This product is high standard and we use it now and then even though our son don't have lice and nit anymore.
4,Fine Hair...,"It works okay on fine hair, but not ultra fine. A friend came to stay and she left us little, crawly gifts. Blech! Tackle those knits and don't worry, they only like clean hair."
3,Overall pleased,"I used it on my daughter's hair while it was still wet from the shower. I was going through her hair with it, tiny section by tiny section, and it wasn't pulling the nits from her hair. But when I used larger sections of hair, it seemed to pull some of the nits out, but not all of them. Overall, I think it's probably the best nit comb out there. I would definitely recommend using it every day until your lice problem is resolved."
5,Works great!,This comb worked great for my daughter's very fine long hair and my son's short thick hair. It finds the tiniest little nits and easily pulls them off the hair strand without pulling the hair.I wish I would have ordered it sooner!
5,a wonder tool,"I am so glad I found this product, works as it said it would and save my sanity. I used many products to get rid off the bugs but this comb was the only thing that help us... thanks."
5,Best Lice nit remover,"I am very happy with this product. It removes nits and lice and all. I have thick,curly hair and shoulder lenght, but I faced no problem. I brushed my hair and applied some coconut oil and then used this comb. I was surprised at the amount of lice it brought out. I used it only once and I feel itchy free and neat!!! I did not use any other kind of product on my hair.I would recommend this product to all and not waste time on anything else."
3,mildly disappointing...,"Was greatly anticipating this read...here it is, an up-close look at someone who spent significant time with the Imperial Family. Finally, an opportunity to get a real glimpse of Olga, Tatiana, Marie, and Anastasia...who else could provide such personal commentary but the one person who spent years tutoring the family?? The promise was there (at least in the title), but the pages never delivered. VERY little at all was mentioned about the daughters, and what little anecdotes offered dealt primarily with Alexei. The most interesting part of the book was his brief description of his confrontation of Anna Anderson, the Anastasia imposter. If you're looking for a biography of the man who tutored the Romanov children...by all means buy this book. If you're looking for personal insight into the Imperial family, don't bother."
4,The Romanovs Revisted,"A very interesting pocket book. A great perspective of the times. For a history buff, a good eye witness biographical account. However, considering the near epic situation of those times and places, the book seems sparse. A noticeable ommission are (the other?) Gibbes' photographs not published in this book. I've seen photographs published elsewhere that were attributed to be taking by Gibbs. A proper mix of these photos and the book would have added much. But still, this book is very much worth reading. For you history buffs, and a complementary account, check out Gilliard's writtings."
1,Worst hot oil treatment,This is the worst hot oil treatment that I've used. It did absolutely nothing for my hair. I've tried plain old Extra virgin olive oil and it did the trick for me. I'll never buy Queen Helen jojoba oil treatment again.
4,drying,The bottle oil is good. What comes in the tubes is a different story. I wanted to do a review of the bottle one since I have purchased before and it was so good to my hair. The tubes I used recently and I noticed it just made my hair more dry. It has a long term effect.
3,Ok - a little difficult,"I bought this book to find hats to make for charity and so far I have found only ones that are overly complicated. I wanted something far easier.If you have a lot of time and are up to a bit of a challenge - try the book, otherwise skip it."
3,"More detail than I wanted, but a good thorough book","This book had some fascinating sections on what exactly Arithmancy is and how it works, the basics of palm and tea leaf reading, what the different planets are supposed to mean (""Mars is bright tonight"".) But somehow it didn't keep my attention as I thought it would. It contained what I was looking for but then went into way more detail than I needed, until I felt like for most of the book I was trapped in Professor Binns' lectures on the history of magic and the full story of which cultures ever associated snakes or werewolves or broomsticks with magic and when. I honestly almost returned this, but I realized I would have wanted a handful of those pages and didn't know where else I might find that information. Colbert's Harry Potter companion book is far more entertaining, though less detailed. But if the history of magic is what you want, then this book is for you."
5,"very good book, a great resource","If you *really* want to know the background to the legends of HP, this is a great resource. Especially for fans running a website or writing fanfics."
1,People enjoyed this???,"J.K. Rowling's lawyers obviously missed this clunker of a book. She should have the Harry Potter name removed immediately! This piece of work is nothing more than a simplistic dictionary, not a guide to anything, unless you count the HP title and page number tacked on to the end of each definition. I kept waiting to learn anything new or interesting about any of the entries... what a waste of time."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book for my mom, who plays HP trivia. I thought it would give her a heads up for some hard questions. It has nothing to do with HP. This is a book about history, folklore and mythology. If you want to learn about HP and Hogwarts don't get this book. If you want to know about the history of magic then this book is for you. The title is deceiving."
1,Only if you have to...,"I love all things Harry Potter except this book. It is not produced with any of the Harry Potter/JK Rowling permissions & I actually returned it! It is not worth it. It is a dictionary of things like: ghost - throughout history people die and sometimes remain behind in the form of an aparition... I made this up - but that is all this is! If you have to have all things Harry Potter, get it used."
4,So that's what that means!,Reading this book has helped me understand what the magical creatures and things of Harry Potter's world are and were. It has got me interested in other Harry Potter prediction and explaination books.
4,very interesting,"my daughter & her friends used this and other similar books to throw a 'Harry Potter"" Finale party and then dressed up and went to the midnight opening show. they had a blast."
4,Magical Breif Encyclopedia,"I do like the book, very interesting indeed.Although I am still waiting for a book that talks especifically about Harry Potter's characters and sites. That it'll work , nothing like an aside book to keep cheking a quick review of a character you just don't remember in that moment, even a spell or a plant or an animal, whatever it is. Oh well."
3,A nice gift present for a Harry Potter fan,"The amount of interesting information in this book is undeniable; however I expect anybody who wanted to look up an object, person or magical item and its history from Harry Potter could do it faster searching Wikipedia. It's one of those books that is fun to have, but not particularly useful. That makes it the perfect book to give to a Harry Potter fan, practicing witch, or anyone interested in the history of magic."
2,Light Orange In Color,"I put ""Red lens sunglasses"" in the Amazon search engine and these came up at the top. The photo of the sunglasses makes the lens look red. My son wanted ""Red Lens"", so I quickly ordered them. When they arrived, the lens were a light orange in color...much closer to yellow. It was my mistake that I didnt read he advertisement better. But since the wording says ""Copper Blue Blocker"", I thought that it was a ""Copper AND Blue blocker"" lens. These were NOT a hit...."
2,Misleading pictures,"I got the item in a timely fashion, which was good, but the photo that was shown for the product did NOT match the product I received. The picture showed dark lenses in a red color, whereas the glasses I actually received were of a very light bright orange color. The item I thought I was buying was what I was really after- the glasses in the photo. Since these glasses I got were not the same in the photo, they are almost useless. The glasses were in great shape, new condition. If you are considering buying from this seller, I strongly advise contacting them first to get a confirmation to what the product actually will be.... although judging from the other reviews, that might prove to be a little difficult.Venture II Safety Glasses w/ Copper Blue-Blocker Lens"
5,Better than I expected,"I didn't expect too much from these sunglasses based on some of the reviews. But I figured for the price, why not try them. The cheapest Blu-blockers I can find in stores like Walgreens or Target are at least $15, and they generally don't hold up to my abuse too long before before they're too scratched to use. These glasses are comfortable, they give good lateral sun protection, and they really do sharpen things up just a bit. My only complaint would be that they don't fold up very compactly, but I can live with that. For under 9 bucks, if you generally run through sunglasses quickly, you can't go wrong."
2,"Nice glasses, but definitely not blue blocking lens",It seems that it has similar tint like original BluBlocker glasses. You could see still a lot of blue. Best test is to drive next to airport landing strip at night and look on intense blue lights there - original BlueBlocker definitely blocks all blue light. These let roughly half of blue coming through.
2,Inaccurate title description,"These glasses do not block blue light. Lenses are rosey red/maroon. They should be more orange/yellow to absorb blue light. Works for general-use safety goggles, but if you want to shield your eyes from blue light, look elsewhere."
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered three pairs of orange tinted safety glasses from three different sellers and this item was the cheapest quality of the bunch for the same price. There are better options available. I liked the Nemesis ones the best, but the Remington ones were pretty good too. I will probably use those for exercising in the sun. This pair, I will let my kids use in my car if they need sun glasses."
2,Not Blu Blockers,"I especially bought this product due to the title with which it associate itself. Do not be fooled, this is no BluBlocker. It is a very bad and cheap product and I am extremely disappointed with it."
3,Speed With Style The autobiography of Peter Revson,"Heir to the Revlon fortune, and with a movie star mother, Peter lived a charmed life but was killed at the height of his career. Written with Leon Mandel (current publisher of AutoWeek) this book follows Revson as he wins Grands Prix on 2 continents, races at Indy, and finds time for lots of friends and ladies in the racing world. A real guy who lets it all hang out and tells it like it is, or was."
2,Keep Looking,"There are plenty of excellent Play Therapy books out there, this is not one of them. Maybe it's just me, but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly. I need quick access, color and... ART!"
4,I liked Dibs better,"Every person int in play therapy should read this book as it's a classic, but for tech the 101 play therapy book is better. to see playtherapy ina ction I'd recomend Dibs in search of self."
3,easy read,Easy read but a bit redundant in its explinations. The writing sounds like she is talking to you and is not as formal in language as other psychology books. Although it is dated the information within the book is useful for work being done today in this area.
3,Play Therapy,"I use this as a tertiary additional classic text for a course I teach called Counseling the Distressed Child. The material is fairly basic, is good for historical purposes with respect to play therapy, and is written by the very experienced author and play therapist, Virginia Axline."
3,A bit boring.,The authors offer great information about the history of English if you can decipher the long-winded explanations. I would not recommend this book for undergrads unless they have a grasp of historical mapping and civilizations.
3,"Content OK, printing bad","This book provided some interesting content not available in a normal history of English, but I would not have bought the book, if I had seen it in a normal bookshop on the street. It has been quite some time since I last bought a mass-market paperback. I did not expect a non-fiction book to be a mass-market paperback: all other such books I bought were trade paperbacks. In fact, the printing is even worse than some of the old cheap fictions I bought, with many pages looking blurred.After getting this book, I decided I need to make some calculation before I buy a book on-line next time. I will calculate:grams-per-page = weight-in-ounces * 28.35 / pagesorgrams-per-page = weight-in-pounds * 454 / pagesI will stop if grams-per-page is less than 1. This book gets 0.82, while most of my books get a number greater than 1.2."
3,Yikes,"How can we be expected to take a volume on the English language seriously when its first two sentences (trying to make the point that when we sent a message to the space aliens, we did it in English) read:""On 5 September 1977, the American spacecraft Voyager One blasted off on its historic mission to Jupiter and beyond. On board, the scientists, who knew that Voyager would one day spin through distant star systems, had installed a recorded greeting from the people of the planet Earth.""The authors' point isn't even valid. The message was in English because an English-speaking country launched Voyager, not because English is a consensus language for extraterrestrial communication. Not only that, the message was not recorded by a native English speaker, but by the Austrian Nazi Kurt Waldheim. Those onboard scientists will have some explaining to do when they meet ET."
4,Great guide to the series,"but why isn't the series available on DVD? Don't make sense to me. Some material is dated, but overall a valuable aid for teachers."
3,Old story,"This book is as a companion to the PBS series of the same name. However, reading it without watching the series can make the book dull in places. The authors interviewed people with various English accents/dialects and put the interviews in the book, but I found it difficult to get the sense of the accent by reading and thus I skipped over various tracts of the book. The book was, however, very strong in showing how the English language spread around the world. The story of English is the story of exploration and wars, and this the book did very well. The maps in particular were very useful. Although the book was enjoyable to read, the version I read was published in the 1980's and is now dated, although I can't comment on later editions. My recommendation is that the book is valuable as a history story of the spread of English but without the companion series loses much of its value. If your expectations of the book are not that high, then you might be happy with it."
2,Okay I have it but now what,This product doesn't come with any useful instructions. I wrote to the manufacturer asking for directions specifically for how to run/charge my laptop but did not receive a reply. One day I may find some third party instructions but for now it is collecting dust under my computer desk.
1,NOT FOR THE SOUTHERN COOK,"Not for a Texas farm girl!No ham, pork roast, bacon drippings, make your own sausage recipes!Great book for Kosher cooks including a whole chapter on Passover but no Easter Ham.I just couldn't relate to the recipes.""NO PICTURES"" and I mean ""NO PICTURES AT ALL NOT EVEN OF THE FOOD PROCESSOR OR IT'S PARTS"", very important to a cook.I don't even know anyone I could give this book too.Sorry but I returned for a refund!Regards, Linda Henson"
3,No more than a pretty good cookbook--definitely not THE book to own,"I definitely think there are other, better books to use as a main ""go to"" book. If you are adding to a library of cookbooks, there are some interesting recipes here to probably make it worth it. Like another reviewer said, I wish the nutrition facts were included. I sent this back."
3,Half of a great book,"I agree with the other reviewers about the number of terrific recipes, tips and tricks included in this book.But I was EXTREMELY disappointed that the recipes do not include the nutritional information. In this day and age where obesity is skyrocketing, it is irresponsible not to include information that helps us choose recipes that are not only tasty, but healthy for us as well.I hope this information will be included in the next edition."
2,Jewish cook book.,I wasn't interested in many of the recipes. I wanted to use my Food Processor more and needed to know ways to use it for my cooking. I was disappointed. I would name this cookbook the Jewish recipe Food Processor Cookbook.
1,What a waste,"After getting this book, it sat on my shelf for over a year before I finally got rid of it at a cookbook swap this month.All this book tries to do is take a bunch of unnecessary steps to be able to make practically anything in a food processor. But really, who wants to make couscous in a food processor? It's not like you can boil the thing over the stove."
2,NOT a bible - just another book,"Much less than what I'd expect of a ""bible."" Shop around for other options if you're considering this. There are other, better, recipes in other books... I'm sure."
5,I love this book,"The Food Processor Bible tells you 10 times more valuable information on how to use your food processor to the fullest than any other instructional books I've found. Once you've read this book you'll be a pro and all of your kitchen chores will be quick and easy. I thought I knew a lot, but I learned so much. The recipes are a delight, and they work. My favorite recipes so far are the Sesame Cheese Straws which are marvelous and the Sticky Chicky which extremely tasty and showy. I really love this book."
3,Food Processor Bible.......,"I bought this for my daughter, having bought her a food processor for her 16th birthday. I couldn't find a single food processor cookbook in local shops so bought this one on-line. The recipes seem ok, but a 16yo really likes to have pictures and there are none in this book. As I say, the recipes may be ok but, as a cook book, it's quite uninspiring."
2,the food processor bible,"Thought book would have more ""tricks"" on how to use processor. Basically just recipes you could get anywhere. pretty just a waste of money."
1,"Great Information, Wretched Binding","This is a very good cook book and I am returning it because the binding fell apart from the beginning. The cover separated from the rest of the contents, the pages cracked and are falling apart. The book was coming apart from the beginning and has deteriorated ever since. Too bad because the recipes are great. I am returning it, should have done that sooner but it is a pain in the neck. I hope it was just one out of the batch because I am asking for a replacement."
2,Disappointed,This cookbook is okay. There's lots of Kosher and it's just not for me; maybe not being Jewish is why. Who knows? Jean Anderson has a processor cookbook that really is much better.
1,BEWARE - This is a Kosher cookbook - not for everyone.,"I give this one star only to bring the deceptive write-up to your attention. If you are looking for great sausage, pork loin, rib recipes or anything involving non-Kosher foods, you will be sorely disappointed. Even though this is called a ""Bible"", it is really only for this ethnic orientation. I bought this without realizing its bias. It is better to buy a book that has everything and then not make items that you do not wish to eat than have the author pre-determine your food choices based on their personal religious predilection. The write-up here on Amazon does not disclose this severe shortcoming. To that end, I suggest this other link. This is a far superior book. Thanks, and enjoy your food processor to its fullest.650 Best Food Processor Recipes"
2,The Food Processor Bible,"This is an OK book. I liked the simple recipe for potato pancakes; it worked perfectly and it is a type of food (a wet batter that blends potatos and onions) that can only be made effectively in a food processor. However, like the other food processor books I own, it focuses too much on sweets, from muffins to cakes--stuff that (1) you should never feed to children, unless you want to contribute to an addiction to sugar and to the national child obesity problem, and (2) you should never feed to adults over 40, given their propensity for adult health problems like high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels, not to mention fat arms, wide bottoms, and huge bellies. Counting only the recipe chapters in this book, about 40 percent of the text is devoted to sugary junk food. Just look at the people around you. A parade of fatties, tubbos, and heifers. Then ask youself: Do I really want to make Ms. Gilletz's ""Dreamy Creamy Chocolate Cheesecake"" tonight?"
4,great tips,"The book itself has the cover coming apart from the pages - that's a problemThe text seems quite extensive, as far as usage as well as recipes"
3,Not my cup of tea!,"I was very disappointed with this book.It is broken down into categories and there are tons of Jewish recipes. If I hadn't previously been around Jewish cooks, I wouldn't have known what some of the recipes were from just their titles. You will also need an expansive pantry to have the ingredients you will need. I personally need pictures to 'sell' the recipe. The finished dish. Not one picture in the book. Just plenty of reading. Almost like a text book. I will use this book, but it will never a favorite for many reasons."
1,The New Food Processor Bible Becomes Unglued,"The New Food Processor Bible: 30th Anniversary Edition (Bible (Whitecap))Recipes & content seem to be great, however, the binding came unglued after leaving the book open. Haven't even used the book yet. I was just looking at the recipes. Unacceptable!"
2,False Advertising...,"This book really should have been called ""The Kosher Food Processor Bible."" Some of the recipes look pretty good (to be honest, I haven't tried any yet) but I was really put off by the fact that entire categories of food I enjoy (shellfish, for example) were missing. And calling for margarine instead of butter may be appropriate for kosher diets, but it's not good nutritionally or in the culinary sense. (And in case anyone suspects me of bias, I'm Jewish, but don't keep kosher.) I don't mind the idea of a kosher cookbook at all, but feel it should be clearly labeled as such."
5,'the food processor bible',"This is an excellent book. Before owning this book, I owned two other food-processing books by Jean Anderson and my food processor sat on the shelf.The 'food processor bible, by norene gilletz, is an instructional and recipe-reference book. I'm using my processor several times a week now! The recipes are easy to follow and fit in with a busy life style; ingredients are on hand or easy to find.This book is a time saver for me and motivating because the recipes are easy, quick and delicious!Highly recommend this reference and cookbook for the beginner to advanced-creative cooks."
5,Indispensable cookbook for anyone with a food processor,I bought this along with my first food processor and it has been a wonderful addition to my cookbook collection. There are many great recipes and easy to follow instructions.
4,It truly is a bible for processors,"I've never owned a food processor before so I really needed a good cook book. I found most recipes that I tried very good, especially the French bread! I do believe that because of this book I found myself using my new processor almost everyday! This book has not only recipes, but it also answers alot of questions a novice might have about a food processor."
5,my childhood favorite,"My mother has the predecessor to this cookbook (The Pleasures of your Processor, which is now out of print) and I grew up on it's basic as well as delicious recipes. When I moved to my own home it was the first cookbook I purchased!"
