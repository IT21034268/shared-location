2,not for serius readers....,"well... i think this book it's not for serius readers who are really interested in cabalah. What i mean is that this book plays a lot with english tarot and this kind of ""magic"". When i bought this book i was looking for a book entirely dedicated to jewish kabalah some stories and off course some math....Well, this book was not what i expected... if you like tarot,kind of magic maybe you will like it. Not for me."
3,Not the best crochet book I've found,"I bought this book for the motif patterns and how to connect the motifs to each other. I ended up returning the book. There are not many motif patterns or any other patterns which I would use. I'm sure some would find this book valuable, however."
1,Poor title,The book starts off with a chapter quoted from another book.It's so very far off the subject of the title that I had to lookback at the cover to make sure I picked up the right book.The attempts at humor were poor. The rest of the book driftedand only somewhat refered to equine body language. It's not worththe time to read. I returned the book for a refund.
1,A careless reprint,"This Nabu reprint has taken an original without pages vii, viii, 79,80,81 and 82. To read those pages, one may go to google books, and then find out that the same library has a copy with those pages."
2,not worth it,"This is a cheap case. You get what you pay for, but this is hardly worth it. The latches were flimsy."
1,A real letdown,"After the wonderful stories and actors of the first season, it went downhill!!! A most disappointed end to a wonderful story!"
1,More Recycled Cliches,I wonder what Wolf said that was at all meaningful. It seems that any high school or undergraduate student could cobble these thoughts together from the plethora of others who have' said the same things. I am waiting to hear something that is meaningful. Where does the rubber meet the road?
1,How the Mind Can Destroy Understanding,"If Dr. Wolf is trying to obscure whatever it is he is trying to say, he is very successful with this book.I bought the book because he seemed so accessible in ""The Secret"", but here he is anything but accessible. I have no idea for whom he is writing this book, but it was not for me.This is NOT the same Fred Alan Wolf that we saw the movie.Very disappointing."
4,A great read - definitely hotter than others I've read!,"Susan Johnson creates Serena and Beau almost as charicatures of the romance novel genre. An inexperienced, idealistic, beautiful woman - a hard, egnigmatic, incredibly virile man. (The cover is GREAT, by the way.) Although the story line doesn't contain as many twists, turns, or subplots as others I've read, it certainly makes a thorough exploration of the character's thoughts, sexual discoveries and passionate intrigues. It was a fantastical change from the standard romance novel - definitely steaming - and surely worth the whole 2 days it took me to read it. (Sorry, couldn't put it down.) Because of this book, and because of other rave reviews I have read on Susan Johnson, I am tracking down everything else she has written! I think her books will make this impending winter weather very bearable!"
2,"HOT sex, but not much else...","In typical Johson fashion, the pages fairly burn before you can read them; despite the intense, trademark sex scenes that Johnson writes so well(and with so little inhibition! :^) )this book falls flat. As with several of her more recent publications, the story seems to be more a string of encounters with not much else to hold it together. I really didn't feel much of a relationship ever got started between hero and heroine(they were too busy groaning and gasping to talk for long enough to get to know each other). The best part of the entire book was a glimpse into the lives of Beau's parents that contained emotional impact enough to carry the book if they'd had another scene. Bring back the days of FORBIDDEN, GOLDEN PARADISE, BLAZE, and SINFUL, where there was more to the protagonists' relationship than what went on between the sheets!!!!!"
3,Hot but not romantic.,"I enjoyed Wicked only due to some of the erotic love making scenes. That's it. It is because of heroes like Beau St Jules that the the term 'male chauvinist pig' has been coined. Inspite of being REPEATEDLY unfaithful to the heroine, he was always getting jealous even if she spoke to another guy!Susan Johnson can write a good erotic romance as evinced in Brazen and Forbidden, where the heroes (inspite of being male sl*ts) were redeemable and lovable.Susan Johnson went so over the top with her description of Beau being the biggest rake in England that I have a hard time imagining Beau being faithful to Serena afer their marriage..."
1,A skimmer,"The author skimmed on character development and I ended up skimming to the end to find out why anyone would give this book 5 stars. Why would Serena jump into bed with Beau so soon? Beau was too young to be a such an experienced rake. Serena obviously did not want to appear to be Beau's kept woman but that was what she was. Actually, they both were sluts and I just could not connect with them. There was no romance, only sex. Worse of all, if all you want to fill pages with sex at least be entertaining, the sex scenes were boring, the author skimmed here too."
2,"More story, less sex!","Explicit sex does not a good story make!This book reminds me of a skin flick--some very steamysex scenes loosely tied together by a very flimsyattempt at a plot. If you want true romance withmain characters you can care about, this is not the bookfor you. (The one shining jewel about this book is thecover! :>)"
1,"Not Hot, No Plot!","This was not a romance novel and in my opinion it was not hot. I personally like stories that are sensual and erotic. This story didn't try to develop any type of a bond or relationship between the characters. I think it is easy to write a story that consist of nothing but crude sexual encounters and explicit language. It takes real talent to weave a plot and story with depth and substance as well as romance and senuality. This was the 1st and probably the last Susan Johnson book I will ever read. I expect more than this in a ROMANCE novel. If you want to read an erotic story that is not a glorified porno I recommend ""PURE TEMPTATION"" by Connie Mason."
1,What happened to romance?,"This book is not a ""romantic novel"". What it is is filled with gratuitous sex and what's with all the vulgar language. I'm talking foul mouthed. This is just soft porn in the guise of a novel. I'm not a prude, but I like a story line that builds up to something. I stopped on page 47. Where is Georgette Heyer when you need her?"
1,"Historical, yes. Romance, no.","In a word, disappointing. This was the first book by Ms. Johnson that I have read and it will most certainly be the last. The plot was no more than an excuse to string together a series of sexual encounters. While the attempt is to be erotic, the result is simply crude. Briefly, our ""heroine"", who is running away from her position as a governess to avoid the unwanted affections of her employer's son, stows away on a ship belonging to Beau St. Jules, well known rake and all around scoundrel. They fall immediately into bed, where they spend most of the rest of the novel. There is no character development, and I simply can't comprehend what they see in each other -- I found both Serena and Beau to be rather unlikeable. I rarely consider a book to be a waste of time or money, but this one certainly was both."
2,One great song.,"Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy anything on this album, except the first song, which is wonderful. A smokin' 80's rocker. Do yourself a favor and download the MP3 version of it. You'll probably be doing Aldo a favor too, because I'm pretty sure that's the only way he'll get royalties on this."
2,Gel VS. Cream,I absolutely LOVE Anthony shave cream.I made the mistake of ordering the shave gel this time.Shave cream is 10 times better!!!!!!
1,Don't use if you faint at the sight of blood,"For the most part, I am a huge fan of the Anthony Logistics product line. I got the shave gel as a sample. It does not lather up at all -- which is excusable if it at least lubricates your beard. It did not at all. I used it with my Futur Merkur blade, and neck was a bloody mess (literally) after my shave.For the best shave, splurge on a badger brush and proraso shave cream!"
3,Just ok,"Just like the other reviewer said, its thin gel. Its not enough for my sensitive beard. I'll stick with Bump patrol shave gel I found on Amazon around the same time and works really well. Much cheaper too."
3,Can't tell how well it works since the 3M paper won't stick to it,"I bought this to go with 3M adhesive sandpaper. The paper did not stick to it for more than 30 seconds. I've been searching for a replacement for one that had a slightly padded surface. This one is simply mildly flexible plastic, and I suppose it would work fine if you can find a brand of sandpaper disks that will actually stick! Sent it back with the paper."
4,works fine,"I've had a couple of similar disc pads, and find that the flexible ones allow me to push the sanding disc into small spaces and follow curves, without deep scratching as I've found the rigid pads produce. Lately I used it to sand legs of two antique porch chairs (you know, the metal ones Grandpa and Grandma always had) so they could be primed and painted. Also use these on walking sticks and canes to finish and refinish. One note: if your sanding discs are not fresh, they may not stick very well. Shipping and delivery - excellent, thanks."
2,Poor quality control,"I bought this as a gift, hence selecting the knife set with an impractical box. But I knew the recipient would really like the box. I checked them out before mailing, which is a good thing. The knives are very sharp. The box is a nice concept (beautiful bamboo) but it looks like it was a 3rd graders arts and crafts project. The hinge screws were stripped and pulled out of the wood. The routering spaces for the knives was all chewed up. I will spend several hours at least making it look presentable. The concept of quality control does not exist at that factory!"
5,Love,"Seriously, these are fabulous knives that are weighted properly, sharpen up quick and fit in my hands. One of my chef friends recommended these and I had my husband buy them for me probably 6 years ago and they're still going on strong."
5,Just what the Chef ordered,"My daughter is a budding new chef. A co-worker of hers had these knives. She tried his knife and was hooked. She said the knife made her many daily cutting jobs ""like butter"" She also said she needs to be very careful because the knives are extremly sharp. She asked for them for Christmas and was so excited to have her own set. She put the larger knife in her kit at work and has the smaller knife at home. My daughters hands are not very large and alot of knives feel very cumbersome in her hand. She said that these knives fit so well in her hand and she felt very comfortable cutting with them. According to my daughter she is so happy and satisfied with her knives. I am so happy I was able to purchase them for her."
4,"Good knife set, but watch for mislabeling","I was sent a mislabled Gusto Grip set instead. These are very nice in that they have a rubber grip. I would have prefered the coppertail ones, as they match the decor of our kitchen, but the ones I received are great!"
4,SHOULD HAVE WAITED !,"..........I PAID TOO MUCH FOR THESE KNIVES, THOUGH THEY WORK WELL. I SHOULD HAVE SHOPPED AROUND."
5,perfect,"I love these knifes. I don't cook everyday but when I do these make my life a lot easier. I don't need 12 different kinds so I was happy to see this set of two. The grip is very comfortable, it's nice and lightweight. I'm know the other reviewers have talked about the sharpness. I love how sharp they are, thats he whole point right?"
2,Nice look but .......,"Look good from afar, but near a little strange in hand.They look cheap. I think that the steel which they were made ''is not very good. Are sharp but I do not know how long it will last up to sharpening. For that money can buy one, but very high quality knife.Do not forget I bought them for a gift and I am glad that I did not use them.:))"
4,A nice combination.,"Larry Niven is one of the best science fiction writers around. John Byrne is one of the best comic creators in the industry. The two combine to make a wonderful piece of pictorial literature. The Green Lantern is one of my favorite comic book heroes to this day. The mingling of science fact, science fiction, and fantasy creates a compelling story. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did when I picked it up. Happy reading."
3,it's readable,"although the storyline is deep in the science fiction and depicts lepricans as long lost guardians, it does contain a nice glimps of the guardian who presented the final ring to kyle. all in all a book worth reading but don't get in a wreck hurring to the comic book store trying to get your copy."
4,it works,This item appears well made and functioned well for the limted time of usage since purchase.Just a warnning do not use this collet for prolonged time because the prior collet shatter after prolonged use when removing a bit.
5,works great,I had an old butterfly wrench and it broke so I bought this one and it works great and the price was right.
2,Image is incorrect,"I purchased this butterfly impact for a tool I was building, the tool had an impact just like the picture. The impact I recieved from Amazon did not look like the picture so I had to rework my tooling, I needed to use the front 4 bolts for mounting but the impact I recieved had the 4 bolts in the rear."
4,Just returned from Rome!,"I borrowed this book from a friend to use during my recent trip to Rome. I found it very useful and easy to use. Compact and easy to carry in a purse or pocket. However, I lost it halfway through my trip and could not find another one in Rome! Therefore, I am buying my friend a new one and myself one for reference!"
4,Fourth album a gem,"4th release by these troubadours from a by-gone era. Of Mosaic And Muse continues the band's exploration of midieval music, blended in with some slightly more modern sounding pieces.Frontman Daniel Crommie has penned half the tracks on this disc. Some are instrumentals where his beautiful buche (midieval dulcimer) leads the charge, while on the vocal tracks, his Ian Anderson-like tenor voice is a perfect compliment to the music.Fans of authentic medieval music will lose themselves in this disc. This is not merely a modern twist on a old musical style; this band truly recreates the delicate beauty of the music from the age of Camelot. Haunting melodies where dulcimer, oboe, flute, and viola coalesce into delicate gems.This is a superb Sunday morning disc, to be listened to while savoring a cup of hot java and letting time stand still for a moment."
3,"Dated, but nevertheless facinating.","The United States is conquered by the Soviet Union and Communist Chinese. This book is about the aftermath--life in conquered America. With the effective demise of Communism, this book is a bit anachronistic and dated, but it is still a fine read and it retains its ability to fascinate. Other than the South in the Civil War, America has never known defeat. This novel manages to convince the reader that such defeat is possible, and in the novel it is plausible.Of course, there is more to the book than just the defeat of America. But that would be telling. This is a novel well worth reading and owning."
2,It's not what it looks like,"I received this item and have not used it yet. But the description and the picture lead you to believe you will get 3 blast gates. You only get one. and the description on the box says this. I couldn't find anywhere in the ad or in the picture of 3 blast gates, that told me that I would only receive one blast gate. Beware!"
5,"Romance, conflict and comedy in the English countryside","Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, newly widowed, finds that all her dreams have come true, she now controls Grantleigh Manor in the picturesque English countryside. However, tragedy follows when she finds that her husband left the estate bankrupt, and in the hands of receivers. The Manor is sold to the charming and rich Richard DeVere, leaving Audrey to scheme a way back. Along the way, the reader is rewarded with an interesting and romantic story liberally sprinkled with wit and humor.To those who have seen the television show: This is the book upon which the late `70s/early `80s show was based. Much of the book corresponds to episodes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7. However, the book contains a number of subplots that do not exist in the show, and the conclusion is an absolute masterpiece."
5,Best British Comedy Ever!,"The book ""To the Manor Born"" is based on the BBC series of the same title which was produced in the late 1970's. Peter Spence is both the author of the television series as well as this delightful book. The story revolves around the life of the recently widowed, youthful Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton. She is a wealthy, English lady who looses her manor due to the overwhelming financial debt of her late husband, Marton Fforbes-Hamilton. Audrey is forced to live/adjust to life as one of the ""little people"" in her village, while she plots/schemes to regain her rightful title as ""lady of Grantleigh Manor"". There are several subplots in the book which were not included in the television series. The ending is superb,a masterpiece!"
5,"Ladies, here's the book your man needs","At first I wasn't exactly flattered when my fiancee got me a how-to book about sex--gee, thanks a lot. But this little volume is as much about humor as it is about ""getting it on""--and it is hilarious! Full of smart advice, tidbits, do's and don'ts, and a seriously sexy cover. I'm gonna get a bunch of them for my groomsmen. Meanwhile, for other women who might be thinking about picking this one up for their men, the tone of the instructions is pretty much summed up by the first three words: ""It's about her."" Ain't that the truth!"
2,several women joking,"I bought this book thinking that it would shed some light on the subject that I know very little about, but alas you would be very disappointed when it arrives at your door. I read the whole book in about one hour and it left me just one step closer in understanding women. The book is printed in about five fonts and it gives you the impression that each font is the personality of a separate women. So as you read the book you get the sense that you are overhearing girlfriends talk dirty. Although I got a chuckle about every few pages I think that my two-star rating says it all."
1,death throes of an industry,"This dvd-r uses fake letterboxing which obscures a good amount of the full-screen picture, including June Fairchild's full frontal sceneNOT THAT I NOTICED. The contempt of the US dvd industry for its own product(and consumers) is symptomatic of the greed that consumed it.Let the dinosaur sink into the tar pit and get a copy from reputable bootleggers."
3,Teasing short skirts,"I suppose the '70s promoters of this thing thought there was some sort of serious ""message"" in satirizing the importance of football against the backdrop of sexy coeds being murdered.I'm a bit of a Roger Vadim fan since his movies tend to emphasize pretty girls. This movie has lots of pretty girls, mostly in short skirts. One of the earliest scenes is a boy walking towards the school as a girl in front of him bends over to pick up her books. At that time in fashion history, skirts were so short that girls *never* bent over, except in movies (see ""Smile"")."
4,The Ultimate Classic is Here!,"One of the classic films of all-time has finally made it to DVD. Angie Dickinson as the teacher we all hoped we'd have, steals the picture. While Rock Hudson, Telly Savalas and Keenan Wynn all are prominent, it's Angie's film all the way. Just seeing the bath scene with her student as she tries to find the soap, is worth the price alone, not to mention the chocolate duck moment.Angie Dickinson never looked better and some of the fashions she wears are unlike anything that a school marm would be seen in.Finally, the Osmonds singing the title song add to the campiness."
3,3 star movie 0 for wrong format,You know because of the modern day technology every freakin movie has to made or cut to make it wide screen.( talkin about movies shot in 4x3 full frame ). I have a full frame copy and every time dvd companies make a reissue of older full frame they literally cut 40 percent of the film off top and bottom so they can have black bars. I can't stand it. Too many movies have been reissued and ruined because of this. At one time early on with dvd's they used to offer a original full frame and a new cut wide screen. Be nice if they weren't so lazy now and offer that. Good movie though.
3,Students of Roddenberry and Bill Theiss will like this.,"I didn't expect much from this film, but it's really quite good for a B movie, much better than Gene's later TV pilots that I've seen - no preaching! The humor is somewhat subtle. Telly Savalas dominates his scenes and Rock Hudson seems off form, perhaps because his role isn't humorous. Bill Theiss does the costumes, running wild with the nightgown. Some of the plot elements seem to be autobiographical (not the murders). I wonder if they are from Gene's life? Read ""Inside Star Trek"" by Solow and Justman, to see what I mean."
3,Not Too Happy At All,"For what it is, I am very happy. That is, letter-boxed, and in stereo.However, it is not close captioned, there are no extras at all.What I am still incredibly unhappy about, and the main reason that I gave it, and ... only 3 stars, is because it was assigned to the U.S. Post Office. Therefore, it arrived one day later than I was led to believe that it would.Now, had it arrived on the day that it was supposed to have, then I would be giving this film 4 stars."
2,Collectors Only,"A collection of Laurel and Hardy and other film-comedians' early work, in a disjointed series of short silent films. Not much entertainment value!"
2,warning amazon does not tell you it's a silent movie,"These are indeed classic L&H films. Unfortunately, they are silent. If you want to see the classic L&H you are used to, this is not it."
3,Funny but not rock solid,There are indeed a couple of good shorts on here but they are supported with some not very interesting material. It's still worth the money but the other material is more for general interest than as being representative of the pair at their best.
5,Possibly some of the funniest films aver made,"They are that funny! I bought it because it had ""Big Business"" - a film that was always shown on Christmas when I was a child in Sweden. I was so glad that I still find it funny. The other films are a bit uneven. They are, of course, all funny, but not as funny as ""Big Business."" The other favourite is ""The Finishing Touch."" This is suitable for anyone with the slightest sense of humour. They are the purest examples of Stan Laurel's special brand of slapstick. It goes a bit like a Greek drama: we know it will all end in chaos, we just do not know how. The scene is set at the beginning of the short, the characters are introduced, and slowly the small disasters and misunderstandings build up and amplify. Smiles, lead to chuckles, lead to howles, and finally to tears, stomach cramps, and frantic grasps for air as the short gets more and more unbelievably funny."
4,From innovation to product,Although this book is mostly for aviation aficionados it gives it's own insight to the issue of making innovation into a product.I liked the way book took it's reader into the battle of innovator proving his inventions merits to an industry for which the very invention was a disruption of long lines of established products. Franks obstacles can be common for many other developers/engineers that want to make a product that changes the world.
4,Jet Engine History Revealed!,"If you are an aficionado of turbine engine history you owe it to yourself to find out how it all started. John Golley gives an exhaustive account of Frank Whittle's struggle to develop and perfect the first jet aero engine. The technical difficulties are discussed, but the emphasis is on Whittle's battles with the British government over private versus government control of patents, R&D funding, and development work. It also illustrates how war-time necessities can actually delay experimental work when priorities are placed on existing technology (i.e. piston engines). Well written with great detail on who, what, where, and when. Working in the engineering field myself, I would have liked to have more detail on the ""nuts & bolts"", but this is a minor complaint. There is more than enough detail in this area for the average reader."
2,"I ususally like Rodi, but this one is not so good...","It's trite and cliche- and really boring- one thing Rodi's books rarely are. While it seems the author is attempting to let us inside the heads of the gay brothers seperated at birth, one never really gets it nor likes them and while the end is supposed to be sweet and funny, it just felt flat and silly."
5,The Ultimate Drag Queen Novel,"Okay, to be fair, there aren't nearly enough novels featuring drag queens in lead roles, so the competition isn't exactly fierce. Still, this is the best. Robert Rodi does a great job of crafting solid characters while avoiding stereotypes, and he keeps the comedy coming at a brisk pace. He also manages to trot out the old twins trading roles cliche and imbue it with new life. A fast, fun read."
2,"first half stinks, last half rocks",i found this one to be weak. boring characters and no pizzaz. until the last bit where the book gets an adrenaline shot and oozes with farce like an almodovar film.
4,Coming to Terms with Fallibility,"I bought this novel a year and a half ago and find myself constantly returning to it. For me, one of the central themes of the novel is coming to terms with familial, and, ultimately, personal fallibilities--a timely message. The forty-seven year-old protagonist progressively learns to forgive her parents, her lover, and, finally, herself for reactions to the events of half a lifetime ago.This novel draws from several literary genres--the romance novel, coming-of-age story and cultural study."
1,Infallibility was Flawed,"The book is very simplistically written. It is a good read for the younger set, but I caution you. I kept trying to find a redeeming quality for the story. I firmly believe that children's literature should be uplifiting and enlightening. Life is tough enough. The message was if you get pregnant when you are young - your life is over. I don't want my children reading this. The struggling heroin goes no where in life, her child is on a fast track to destruction, and there is no light at the end of the spiraling tunnel. The author has worked out her personal demons using the public as fodder. This should have been written in a journal and kept there."
1,Pay for What you Get,"I should have known....it didn't cost much, and I didn't get much. But, some may find it useful. I didn't."
3,Pretty good,"It will protect the exterior from scratches and perhaps from some minor trauma, don't think that it will protect it from a fall.... additionally, you should buy a keyboard and/or screen cover to protect the functional components of the computer."
4,pretty good,"The case isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It's done everything I expected it to do. It fits well, it protects my macbook from my abuse and I haven't noticed any scratches from the case. The color is bright and matches my hair, and the case doesn't bulk up my macbook very much. All in all, pretty good, although I think it is a tad too expensive for just a computer case."
4,Easy on!,"Four stars only because I just received it today and just put it on my new 13"" MacBook. It's candy-apple red! It snapped on easily; all the holes line up, and it doesn't interfere with operation or closing. Just wish it had arrived when my MacBook did a couple weeks ago so I would have a pristine, finger-print-free to put it on."
3,its nice but be carefull and patient,"i bought a clear se thru case a month ago,and im very happy on the job that it perfomred on my 13 inch macbook,quite expensive but it works good,it prevents scratches and protects your most valuable apple macbook,but then i also just bought a green colored case and tried it on,no problem removing the back cover,the one with the air vents just took me 1 min,the hard part was the top cover,i had to pry it with my thumbnail,making sure i wont damaged the macbook instead of using a knife or a cutter,so the worst part is i injured and broke my nail,God that was painfull,my nail has abreak in the middle and it bled for 1 minute.hope the SPECK guys do something about it otherwise more people might get injured and frustrated"
2,not the best choice,"The product doesn't look like the picture.The actual product look like something from a barbie warehouse. The Apple light at the dorsal surface of the laptop is basically blocked (they should've cut the apple outline out). Also, the top cover doesn't actually touch the laptop in the middle, it bulges out a little, annoys me.If I can go back in time, I'd pay more for a better one."
4,"Great price online, silly price in stores.","What can you say about a laptop cover? It fits, it comes with a wipe to keep it clean. It's simple to use and I've no complaints. I also have a keyboard cover so I feel safer when using this in public and semi public places. Less likely to be missed because its bright color and while it will not completely protect myself from a full out spill as the back is still ""open"" I feel safer with it on."
4,It works,"It does exactly what you want it do, it protects your macbook from scratches and etc. I hear people talking about how it scratches their macbook, and I have to disagree. It hasn't hurt mine at all, and it has protected it from getting some pretty bad scrapes. I think half of the issue, is people do not know how to remove their case. You have to be really really careful with it."
2,only great at first,"I bought my macbook a little over a year ago. I immediately purchased the case to protect it and it seemed like a great idea at first. It does however create internal scratching on its own and bumpy rough scratches end up appearing on the cover. If you're willing to remove the case ever so often and wipe it down, maybe it would keep it looking better. Plus, removing the case is such a frustrating process. I always feel like i'm walking on eggshells. unless you're a neat freak and could handle the pressure while opening it don't get it."
3,"Speck MacBook 13""",It was very nice. It came new. The only thing is the top is a little big and it doesn't stay on very well.
4,It is really cool!,"It not only can protect my Apple, but also looks very cool! When I use my apple on some public places, people alway look at my macbook and say what a beautiful Apple!I am a pink girl and I love this magic speck!"
3,Love it!,"I have THE COOLEST macbook ever because of this! Everyone comments on it and since I am a very pink person, this cover is completely me!It was easy to get on and has fit on it well.My only complaints would be that the computer heats up fast (which it would without the cover). I would like this cover to have bigger mounting spots underneath so that the computer is lifted a little and there can be more air flow.Also, The top right corner seems to come loose and I'm often snapping it back in - not a big problem though.I've experiences the mounting grip pads underneath slide from their spots but I just put them back and they're fine.I'd def. buy again!"
4,Just what I was looking for,"I read numerous reviews on a variety of sites before purchasing this case in red. I was nervous because several people spoke about horrible scratches to their MacBooks, but I really liked the color and did not want a zip-up case. I would DEFINITELY buy this case again! I just took my case off (after re-reading these reviews) - fairly easy, took about 30 seconds. The case: lots of scratches, dirty (I do take my MacBook absolutely everywhere). The laptop: perfect, with one little scratch on the edge (which may have occurred before I bought the case). I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the case itself scratches easily and it's pretty pricey. But I have no regrets at all."
1,TERRIBLE BUY,"I got my brand new white macbook and I wanted it to be protected from wear and tear. I bought the Speck case, thinking it would help protect my laptop, but it definitely did a lot more damage than protection.Before buying, I thought it was expensive, but figured it was worth it. I was SO wrong! This case is a piece of junk. Like other users, the rubber feet fell off, which left nasty sticky stuff on the plastic which accumulated dust, hair, and dirt. Disgusting. Also, the dirt that got between the case and my laptop scratched it up. When I first put the case on, I thought it looked cool. It scratches so easily that now I just want to rip the thing off, which is nearly impossible. So far, I've only been able to get the bottom off, and I'm scared I will hurt my computer trying to get the top off. This product is a complete rip-off; it was probably made in some foreign country and is worth a couple bucks, though it is sold for nearly $50.Take my advice: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"Scratch issue, but not on your Mac","I used this for about a week and it didn't do anything to my mac, but the case itself got some ugly scratches on it. I treat my computer very well and the only 3 places it is are on my desk, my school desk or in my book bag inside a neoprene case. After a week there were some bad scratches on the case and looked really bad. The plastic they use to make these is really soft, so it gets scratches easily. I wouldn't recommend buying unless you never move your mac, which defeats the purpose.Looks great, but only for a short time. Shouldn't be bought for protecting your mac. Shouldn't be bought at all."
4,spots and squeaks?,"just put my cover on a little while ago, i like the way it looks, but it does show where the case touches the laptop and has dark marks that i can't make go away that are kind of annoying for anyone a little ocd. otherwise i think it looks good, it squeaks a little but i haven't had it on for all that long yet. if anyone knows how to get rid of the spots please let me know.."
5,Great protection for MacBook,"A great product - snug fit on the laptop, and appears to be a part of the laptop itself. Difficult to remove, but no real reason to remove it anyway."
2,"Doesn't fit all 13"" macbooks","this product, unlike it's advertisement claims, does not fit all versions of 13"" macbooks. the bottom was much too large and plastic made obnoxious noises every time i opened my laptop. the plastic holes cover most of the power, and usb inputs so it is virtually impossible to connect any plugs to the latest version of macbook. within two days of owning this product during airport travel (which isn't particularly grimy the way that camping or road tripping would be) dirt got in between the laptop and cover and scratched the computer. if you have the new ""green"" version of macbook i would strongly advise against purchasing this product."
2,Nice but InCase covers are better,Protects the macbook well. No problems with dust scratches as some reviewers have reported but I kept it pretty clean. Returned the product because the InCase cover was better - ICase was softer to the touch and had nice cooling holes on the bottom.
4,Macbook Shell,"Pretty slick for the price and the fact that it's not permanent.I was so sick of wiping fingerprints off the black macbook, this is just what the doctor ordered. Granted, it's not as sexy as the black, but the red over the black at least looks different. And fingerprints are much easier to tolerate on red plastic than the black matte material of the macbook."
2,Difficult to remove!,"I tried the case on my beloved new Macbook, and actually thought it looked pretty cheap -- brighter and shinier than I had imagined from the photos. Anyway, when I went to take it off it was nearly impossible. Eventually I managed to pry off the top using a razor blade to chip away at the plastic. Needless to say I can obviously not return it now. What a waste of money! I gave it two stars, because at least it didn't damage my MacBook, but I think that probably says more about Apple's standards of manufacturing than Speck's."
2,its ok,i received on time...but the case its not the same that the pic shows...it doesnt have the apple frame...so it was dissapointing..
3,Hard case,Nice to give your laptop a special look.Boutht it for my daughter. They don't uses books anymore omn school.But very expensive.And now I get a extra bill from the FedEx (???) Strange.
1,Does Not Fit,This product does NOT fit the MacBook! The slots are wrong and no way fits the MacBook so be careful upon purchasing this hard case.
3,"Pretty, but it doesn't quite do its job.","I got it because I wanted to protect my Mac from damage, and because it was pretty.After having the case on for about a month, scratches had developed everywhere over the surface of my Mac, probably due to imperfections in the plastics rubbing together. It makes it look like I have ""stuff"" between the case and the Mac.It is pretty though.. I'll give it that."
1,Not for New Mac book 2009 and beyond!,I bout this for my brand New Mac Book 2009 edition. it doesn't fit on Newer model mac Book. there is a different casing from previous models. Thank you god my boyfriend found some good use to it.
2,Do NOT buy this product if you want to keep your MacBook looking nice and unscratched!,"I bought this product because it was advertised to protect my macbook from scratches. Unfortunately, less than six months after I put it on my brand-new laptop, I discovered that the plastic case had trapped incidental dust and dirt in between the case and the laptop, and had scratched my entire computer irreparably. Sure, my computer still works, but the once-pristine laptop case is now scratched, far more than it would have been had I NOT purchased this cover.I am currently in negotiations with Speck to get my money back and damages. The product is well-engineered in terms of usability of the Macbook, but poorly thought out in terms of protection of the laptop."
2,The cover scratches my MacBook,"I bought one of these when I bought my Macbook to keep it in pristine condition, just a few months ago. I just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the Macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my Macbook.They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the Macbook of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop.Really stupid design. It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity). I don't think in the long run it was worth $40, and I feel very misled by the marketing for this cover. Given the choice again I would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money."
3,"Good, but a lot of & for a piece of plastic.","It looks good on my white macbook and I suppose it offers some level of protection but... there is probably only a dollars worth of plastic in this 40$+ cover... hard to justify. I have also bought a black napa leather cover from covercase for a few dollars less that looks awesome, gets many compliments, keeps my legs cool while sitting on my lap and wont scratch the surface of my macbook because there is no hard plastic touching the case, just a soft red felt lining. Check out covercase on Amazon sold by third party but good service."
1,Same problem as below.. scratches!,"Exactly the same issue as other reviewers.. the exact thing I bought the product to prevent, has happened because of it.Dirt and dust gets caught between the case and the macbook- and just grinds away, leading to deep, deep scratches.So upsetting!"
1,looks can be decieving,"I initially realy liked this product, but i realized that it makes the screen half much heavier and as a result the nubs which meet the bottom half when the laptop closes have been cracking the plastic of the laptop when they close it. I have since taken this cover off my laptop because it causes too many problems (even though it looks cool)"
2,read important!!,"i have had this ""case"" for two months, ive had two of them so far why i give this pice of 50 dollar plastic 2 stars is because after a week or so i spotted some scratches on my macbook and i immediately removed this junk. there were over 30 scratches i wet my finger and removed some of them but there were still a vast number remaining so if you are to buy this i suggest you put a pice of paper inside this well acutely a few pices of paper"
3,Speck Macbook cover,The front cover got dust and crude under it in the first week. So we just took it off and use the bottom cover only.Saw a woman at work with only the top part on and she said same thing happened to hers!
2,Can't remove it!,"I just got this and attached it with no problem. But when I tried to remove it to change batteries, I can't, not without feeling like I'll break apart my computer or the plastic cover. I've tried moving the tabs, but this thing seems really stuck! Anyone have the same problems? Suggestions? ThanksE"
2,MacBook Case Fail,"Had a bad experience with Speck,no longer recommended these guys.Had my shell get damaged by the case.Now i goto [...].Case fits, good and its a really good price."
1,Classy - but didn't fit Macbook,The top piece fit decent - but the bottom piece was way too big - what good does it do to have it only cover one part? The top does show quite a bit of smudging - and it was scratched within a week. I thought it would hold up much better for the price paid.
1,Can not contact seller?,I purchased this product and did not realize it wouldn't fit a mac pro. I have made numerous attempts to contact this seller on a possible return (case is unopened) and have not had any response. I suppose customer support is not a priority for this company.
2,Not worth it,"I ordered this product after reading reviews on how good it is at protecting a macbook. I went through all of the cleaning steps before putting it on my macbook, but even after doing that I still noticed that there were scratches on the case. Since I was so excited about having it I put it on anyways, thinking that it was just my imagination. Not only were there scratches on the cover, but it scratched my macbook too. It is possible that it could have just been the retailer I ordered it from, but I would strongly advise thinking about whether you really need it before buying it."
3,"Decent, but not Incredible.","LIke others, my experience with the Speck SeeThru has been mixed. I only had it for a brief time, and I found it to be a little ugly, and the protection it provided was questionable. I'm sure it protected against scratches and minor bumps, but it also seemed unnecessary and a little unwieldy. Ultimately, what made me give it up and resell it was the price- I personally cannot justify this price for something that seems to be primarily for looks. My MacBook is pretty enough without it.If they made it in solid black, I'd reconsider the Speck SeeThru (though I guess it wouldn't be ""seethru"" then, would it?)Get this if you want to have a unique-looking MacBook. if you're looking for scratch protection, though, I suggest Best Skins Ever or Invisible Shield."
4,Great!,"I really love my macbook cover. It protects my macbook very well. The only downfall is it gets scratched really easy and somehow gets weird scratches underneath the cover, which made me think that there was big scratches on my actual macbook, but there weren't. I would recommend this item as it protects and makes your macbook more fashionable!"
2,it broke after a few months :(,"One of the little plastic tabs that holds it on broke, and as a result it kept moving. I'm going to try something else.Also, the translucent nature of the cover required me to take it off every few weeks to clean off any visible nasties (just dust--I am responsible with my things)."
3,Priced to high for what it does!,For the price you pay I expected a better fit. Part of the case doesn't actually snap on as it should. I am not sure when this item is so expensive you could probably get away with a cheaper case from another vendor with the same results. But overall it does the job.
3,"Protective, but Bulky and Not Very ""Mac-Like""","In short: If you want to protect your Macbook for a long trip or some other adventure that may damage it, this product is great. Realize, however, that this case will completely ruin the aesthetics of the Macbook, making it look bulky and feel much heavier."
4,Pink is the best (per my wife),I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She says that its pretty good but could fit a little tighter. Apparently the right side catches on things easily and bends back.
5,fit my 1995 Ford Bronco,it fit perfect in my 1995 Ford Bronco i didn't have to trim nothing at all. its in the back floor looks good matches my front mats
5,Beautiful photographs make On High a work of art,"The biography of Brad Washburn makes a terrific yarn, even for us armchair adventurers. This is a well-told tale, with a transcribed ""oral history"" from Mr. Washburn, interspersed with the narrative supplied by Mr. Smith. The significance of Mr. Washburn's life, and what makes this book worth reading, is that his mountaineering adventures were part of the 20th century's final conquest of high places in this world. The high mountains were the last frontier, and Mr. Washburn lived it, wrote about it, mapped it, and (more importantly) photographed it. Fortunately, National Geographic chose to include a variety of Mr. Washburn's best photographs. His friendship with, and admiration for, Ansel Adams is apparent. Buy this for the read, but also buy it as a coffee table book."
1,selfish heroine spoils otherwise good book....,"this time travel romance had a very interesting premise-a married couple whose marriage is on the rocks gets swept together back in time 100 years. The heroine-who acknowledges she married the hero because she was ""flattered"" by his attentions-was so selfish and spoiled that I just couldn't finish this book.From page one the heroine-who is a big city businesswoman-makes her husband see to all their needs, and continually berates him for his decisions. At the point when they reach a decent, albeit in need of cleaning, cabin and she refuses to clean anything I just quit in disgust. The hero was a well written ""good guy"" and certainly deserved a better mate than his selfish wife.not recommended-one star."
3,trriiieeeddd so hardddd,this album has a bunch of great musicians on it here and there like clarence white and the gosdin brothers and a few great songs but most of them just feel ok. it feels like it wants to be somethin like rubber soul with dylan lyrics. his later stuff with doug dillard is much better lyrically and better melodies and overall quality of music. more original with his spot in country rock. this is great if you are fans of all the players involved and a young songwriter tryin to get his craft down
2,"not the freshest, smartest, or best advice for my home","The red cover of this book caught my eye. I had never heard of Anne McKevitt, but thought I would give the book a chance. I was not rewarded for this effort. The pictures are only so-so. I did not find the projects to be inspiring. If you like to do crafty projects you might want to give this book a chance. However, if you are looking for a general book on style, there are other choices available that are much better, such as The Ultimate Home Style Guide by Katherine Sorrell."
1,What are the credentials for this person?,Who is Ann McKivett? Why would I want to know her style solutions?
3,A tolerable Re-hashing,"Trevor Hoyle's _Blake's 7_ and _Project Avalon_ are just novelizations of several episodes of ""Blake's 7"". For those of us who have seen the first season several times through, this isn't too exciting. Hoyle changes quite a few things, which didn't agree with me (i.e. in the series, it was Jenna who knew Avalon, not Cally). An okay book, but the show is better."
4,Nice idea for spices,"This spice rack works great in a drawer. It is a simple design, basically just a thick piece of plastic bent to make the spices lay on an angle. I reused my square Target spices with new labels -- it's beautiful! The spices are tucked in a drawer next to my stove so they are easy access while keeping my kitchen uncluttered.It was reasonably easy to install -- my drawer isn't as long as the rack so I had to get out my handsaw and cut it down a bit. It suggests this in the directions. Unfortunately, the rack wasn't cut squarely -- so I also had to get out my sander and sand down part of a side -- it was about a 1/16"" off and wouldn't fit into the drawer. But after I did that, it fit very snugly and now works well."
4,A little expensive for a piece of plastic but it does the job nicely,"I had to adjust the length and it was no problem by just scoring the edge at the back of the drawer with a razor knife and then bending the plastic until it snapped off. It was pretty easy. If you need to adjust the width, you'll need to cut it with some kind of power saw.I'm happy with the drawer spice rack and I would have given it 5 stars of it didn't cost so much."
5,spice drawer organizers,"This product was exactly as described. By making a cut along one side, it fit perfectly in the drawer. All of my spices are now at finger-tip reach. And the drawer looks GREAT!"
3,for a terrarium,temperature shown by color change is quite faint -- maybe it's better with a water filled tank. so I tend not to look at it.
1,Defected,When I peeled it from the paper backing the thermometer paper peeled off with it. Was never able to use it.
3,Thermometer,"These are ok. Obviously once you stick them, you can't take them off or they will break. They are ok for giving a temperature idea for a small area in a tank. Not 100% accurate though"
2,"Ugh, I should have known","I needed another thermometer for the terrarium and purchased that on even though I'm not a fan of the style. Well, once it's attached, it's on there. I wasn't satisfied with its potition on the tank and ended up throwing it in the trash because it is not reusable. To me it was a waste of money. If you like and prefer this style of thermometer it might work for you, though. I prefer gadgets that I can detach and reposition as contitions change (i.e. new habitat, redecorating etc.)"
4,It sticks very well... a little too well,"While I have been on the whole more than satisfied with this thermometer, knowing that most of its imperfections are shared with all liquid crystal thermometers, there is one problem - if you stick it on and don't like where you put it, be prepared to buy a new one. I'm already on my second because the stubborn thing just wouldn't come off and started to rip."
3,It's about 2 degrees off,"I purchased this to quickly measure the bath water temperature for the Tummy Tub I purchased. I have 2 thermometers for this job--one cumbersome, yet very accurate (which I was hoping to replace) and now the Exo Terra Liquid Crystal strip which I can basically float across the top of the water and it will be accurate within about 2 degrees. It says 96 degrees when the water is actually 98. No huge deal if you are looking for a cheap thermometer and are aware how ""off"" the degrees may be and can compensate for this error."
4,Excellent resource!,"After suffering from migrain headaches for over the past decade, this book provides good insight into the root causes of the brain pain as well as good steps to avoid the headaches. This book provides a practical guide to using prayer, as well as more ""tangible"" treatments. I've found the skills I've learned through this book to be very helpful, as I'll do anything to avoid having to take the medications for migrains. So far, so good."
2,Poor quality for the price,"The ""axel"" which connects the front wheel to the four wheeler broke almost immediately. My 2yr old was so excited to get this toy and he's very upset that it broke. :-("
3,Making a correction,"I'm sorry that you were not happy with the production. If the DVD is faulty, please send it to me for a replacement.No, not filmed in the basement but in a 5,000 sq ft hall where we were hosting the seminar.Yes, out of breath because the exercises are under full tension and demonstrated at full tension. If you're not out of breath with the exercise, you are not pushing enough.Iron Vest is the internal set, Stone Warrior is all external. Please visit my site for more details on the complete Chinese Strength & Health Program.We will refilm this DVD to make the atmosphere more appealing.Thank you for your help.Sincerely,Thomas KeenKeen's Martial Arts"
4,Ancient Strength Program,"First of all, this form costs $100 through another organization, so thank you Prof. Keene for presenting this form at a great price. After sitting on this dvd a couple of years, I returned to it after doing my own Dynamic Tension exercises for a couple months. Combined with pushups this form offers an incredible strength program for anyone with a love of the classical martial arts. I'm dedicating the next several months to this (with pushups)as a stand alone strength routine. Originally I gave a bad review to this dvd, but looking back at what I wrote I can only offer my apologies to the Sifu, and I was incredibly ignorant of Stone Warrior at that time."
3,This is what I think!,"This is a pretty cool game, but about the only improvements from the original RCT are the editors. if you buy this game, I recomend installing it without the expansion pack and playing it for a while. that way you can tell what the expansion pack really gives you. I played my freind's RCT2 w/o expansions before getting this for christmas, and the expansion pack isn't as great as you think. in the park designer, I think it gives to many style options. you might as well get RCT2 alone, unless you're really into roller coaster tycoon."
5,YOWZERS!!!!!!!! I love this game!!!!!!,"This is such a good game...I was starting to get bored and then found the scenario creater which allows you to determine which items (trees, etc.) you want...which park you want to play in...as well as many, many other variables. I have played for hours just doing landscapes, gardens, neighborhoods, malls, etc. without even putting in roller coasters...either way...great game...great entertainment and great fun!!!"
3,Nutralift,"So I've written reviews on a few Pharmagel products in the past few days, and was ecstatic about the other ones- this one is just okay. I had used it in facials at my former job for the treatment masque and really wanted to use it myself. Pharmagel claims that all of their products can work well for even sensitive skin although when both my sister and my mom came in for facials, they said it was stinging. When I used it I actually experienced the same thing, but just the first time around. The second and third time it was fine."
4,Great for the money,"Great bang for the bucks. They might not be the best built but it is money well spent, at least for backup glasses"
2,"Look great, but holy crap are they flimsy","They bent just when I put them on my face. Cannot recommend them other than they look great. If you need them SOLELY for looks, ie for a costume or something, they are great. But if you plan on wearing them for extended periods of time, or use them as sun glasses, just skip"
1,"Extremely low quality, not worth a cent","These are without question the lowest quality sunglasses I have ever seen in my life. One pair broke before I ever wore them; I have no idea how. I realize they cost only five dollars for two pairs, but I would still not recommend buying them; they aren't even worth this. Spend a few bucks more and get some decent shades; even a $10 pair from Wal-Mart is a great improvement from these."
1,Only OK glasses,"Yeah, they are a cheap price, but I am honestly always blind when I wear them. The sun reflects on the inside of the lens and blinds me, and you can't wear them in the shade because the glasses are so dark that you can't see anything. So basically, I can't wear them anywhere."
3,"Cheap, but decent.","These are worth the money. They aren't glasses that you'll want to wear everyday, but if you need a pair for special occasions or as a backup, these were fine. Came with a velvet pouch."
4,tl;dr sunglasses,"I have yet to wear these out as there hasn't been a lot of sun lately, but from walking around indoors they seem pretty dark and the frames seem relatively sturdy. The colour is nice, both the frames and the lenses, and they look like they do in the picture."
5,Video review of the Aviators,"Length:: 0:53 MinsI was a little hesitant to buy glasses online due to fitment issues in the past, but I gambled on these ones and am very happy. For $6, I don't think you are going to get a nicer pair."
5,great glasses!,"after buying aviators that were cheap and the lens shattered, i have been looking to replace them. these had pretty good reviews so i bought 2 pairs. i was happily surprised when i got them! they are sturdy and have a great look to them. the velvet bag they came in is a nice place to keep them safe while in your car or bag. i would highly recommend these for anyone. i gave the second pair to my brother in law and he loves them."
4,Sunglasses but no bag,"Opened my package to find very nice inexpensive sunglasses. Had to give 1 less star because to my surprise there was no microfiber sunglass bag, even though it says there should be one on the sales tag. Nevertheless, I really enjoy the glasses, they feel a bit sturdier than other cheap sunglasses on Amazon. The mirror on the glasses is much more reflective than my other pair and they also feel nicer on the face. Even though I've only recently bought a few sunglasses from different companies on Amazon, I have to say I really enjoy these the most and will definitely buy them again. Hopefully, they'll send me a ""Microfiber Storage Bag"" with my next purchase because I definitely want these to last."
3,Where's my bag?,"Overall, I love my new aviators. Appearently someone forgot to add the bag that was supposed to come with it. :-("
5,Gettin' my terminator on,"What can I say, they're cheap and they are classics. Can't really go wrong with getting a pair at this price. Quality was decent, if youre still thinking about it - don't; you'll love them."
4,"Great, but Cheaply constructed","These aviators are very cool looking and they are great! Only thing is that it is cheaply built, but that is debatable considering how cheap they were"
2,not so great,"I got Aviators of two different kinds to check out and see who the best were, these weren't them.These (G&G; Chrome Metal Silver Mirrored Aviator Sunglasses 3 Pair Special Spring Hinges) are much better. The spring hinges seem to add the the firmness of the frame, and they look better too."
5,Good deal,"These mirrored glasses look great at a fair price. I wear them on sunny days because the lens are a little darker than expected. Because the lens are dark, I would not recommend them as driving glasses, but overall are a great deal."
2,Ok I guess.,"I know the price is cheap and whatnot, not these are the kind of glasses that come in a quarter machine. I opened the box, looked at them, and threw them away. No metal in the construction at all. There actually is but is feels like plastic."
2,crappy,"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! There is a reason real aviators cost over 100 dollars, and there is a reason these don't."
3,i have a question,"say if i order these,becuase im really tempted to do so.i have a tendency unforntunately for ordering shades, that are too big for my head, i have somewheat of a small head.ive tried on various aviators, some, extremely too large for my head, and some just right and pretty small.so my question is, all you people who have ordered these, when they came to you in the mail. were you satisfied? where they of size you wanted them to be? how big are they? small? big?"
3,Flimsy.,I received the item.. In 2 days it got bent from only being put in my pocket. Within 5 days I lost it. I got what I paid for
3,Good Customer Service,"After just three months of light wear and adequate care, the glasses broke. The arm of the glasses simply pulled off. What hinges the arm to the glasses themselves is a very thin and delicate and extremely pliable piece of metal.I am disappointed. I'd be cautioned. If this seems like to good of a deal to pass up, you've been warned.UPDATE: I contacted customer service expressing my disappointment. They volunteered to send a new pair. Let's hope that the original pair I received was a fluke. I can at least give the Source Group credit for standing by their product and doing what they can to make sure their customers are satisfied. They did not have to do this, and it was a good-natured gesture on their part."
3,low price = average,"these glasses are alright for their price, their pretty sturdy and easy to accomodate anyone. they are a little on the large side and the lenses scratch off easy but again their not expensive and fun to mess around with"
3,"Cheap, but could be worse","I purchased these for a Halloween pilot costume. They served their purpose, but I doubt i'll wear them regularly. I'm not sure if all aviators are like this as I've never worn them before, but I had trouble seeing out of these in bright or dim conditions. In bright light there were reflections everywhere and I was blinded. In dim light they were so dark I just couldn't see. They did look great though, so for my costume they were perfect."
5,Outstanding Service!,Just simply... Perfect transaction.....great product.....wish there were more internet dealers like this. Keep up the great work!!!
2,"both pair were damaged, Seller NEVER responded to emails","Both pair of cheap glasses arrived bent, one pair were too bent to use, the second pair were slightly bent but usable. For this cheap price, we did not expect high quality glasses, and we got what we expected, they were cheap quality but would have been sufficient, had they not been bent.We sent many emails to the seller, the seller NEVER, NOT ONCE, responded to our emails.I gave a two star instead of a one star for the following reasons: Cheap price equals low risk, if the glasses are wearable, it is worth the price (one pair of ours was only slightly bent and wearable--since the price was so low, the one pair was worth it)--but it was disappointing that the second pair was unwearable, and that the seller did not deem it worth their time to answer an email."
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!!,"Just received my order today however the packaging the sunglasses came in was a brown bubble bag. The sunglasses were flattened out with pieces missing. Lens were not mirrored as described. There were chips in the tint on the glasses. Virtually unwearable right out of the packaging. On amazon I was under the impression I was to be receiving 2 pairs only got 1. Also they are NOT I repeat NOT the actual size of aviators, they are much smaller. Will never order from this place again. Had to put 1 star but this seller is a ZERO!"
5,Simply Amazing!,"I've had this for almost a year now. They have felt the water and the sun like no other sunglasses that I've had in the past. 2 weeks ago I went to the beach and I was in the water for almost 1 hr and a half with them!Today I'm buying 3 more of them. 1 for me just in case I break or lose the one that I have right now, 1 for my brother and 1 for a friend.I recommend them 100%.Don't think that you'll get Ray-Ban's for US$5. FOR ME, I prefer buying 20 of this than 1 Ray-Ban. They look good, fits great and if I lose them I know I'll always have one in the next few days!"
5,SUper awsome and fast,i order mine silver and they look different from the picture they are whey better and i got a 25% black friday coupon along with them the shipping was in two days and i am so satisfied it came with a price tag of 10 dollars which is good news i totally recomend this item
3,you get what you pay for,"you get what you pay for. I mean, the fact that you pay more for the delivery than for the product should say something. they're not as fashionable as I would have liked, but they're alright, makes a good small gift to some relative :)BUT, I'll say this, I paid for the express delivery, and still it took almost a week to get to me. Blame it to the USPS I guess."
3,speedy delivery but double shipping charge and items differ from ordered,"After ordering several sunglasses from what appears to be same vendor I was charged shipping twice because items were listed twice I guess and at the end have received it both in one package anyway which just proves my point. In addition one item was what I ordered, item 2 Full Mirror lens 2 pack sunglasses arrived as NON-full mirror glass although shipping label inside the package calls for what was ordered Full Mirror lens, obviously a shipping error. Overall it was fast and cheap I admit, but bothersome because I needed items for gift and didn't have time to reorder."
3,wrong for my face,I ordered these sunglasses because I loved the look and but the shape was wrong for my face. I have an oval face and these sunglasses have a round shape. I opted for a different style that had a slightly more rectangular shape.
3,Great Style/Very Poor Quality,"First of all, i thought i was getting 2 sunglasses, but i only got one. I love the style of them, they are very attractive, but they have very poor quality. They are very flimsy. One lens is darker than the other, so when i look though them, i feel cross-eyed. But you can't tell that one lens is darker by looking at them. Great Style / Very Poor Quality"
3,ehhh...,they are alright.but what do you expect for the price.a little stiff in the arms but other thsn that they function like they need to.very fast shipping too.
2,poor drag arrangement,"They use the ""clicker"" as the drag and there is no free spool. Waste of money when for a few dollars more you can get a real reel with free spool and effective drag system."
3,Whistle sucks,"I bought this kettle mainly because the one I had didn't have a whistle. I really liked the looks of this one and the design, and it's easy to add water with the large opening in the top. But the whistle makes such a small amount of noise, you can't hear it at all unless you are standing next to it. If you press down hard on the lid it whistles loudly, but who wants to do that? Poor design on the whistle, but everything else is just fine. I can only give this a three...sorry....{:^(-{{{----["
5,Great Kettle,"Bought this at a local discount retailer. I've had lots of kettles over the years and most I have been dissatisfied with for one reason or another. I am very pleased with my Stainless Steel Copco Torino. The handle does not get hot. It has a steam guard, so you don't get burned. I love the way it pours. The whistle works just great on mine and is the perfect volume. Its good looking, to boot! In fact, I went out yesterday and bought another one just like it for my camper. Very happy with this product."
2,on writing,bought this book more as a historical interest.the auther was involved in writers group during the depression era for the wpa.
4,good for small areas,Fits any standard drill and gets paint off pretty decent. If you expect to do a whole house this is not the product for you but for a small area it good.
3,Stripper works great but kills all my drills.,I have used about 20 of these strippers to strip off 30 year old paint on cider block. It works great taking off the paint but I've gone through 3 drills. The dust from them seem to clog up the drills and I'm still not done.Deb
2,A sequal to The First Four Years,"The book On The Way Home by Laura Ingalls Wilder was in my opinion the best book I read all summer becaus it tells the story of a girl (Laura) over coming obsticals. Such as realizing and excepting that they (Laura and her husband Almanzo)could no longer live were they were.They could not grow any crops so she made the disition to go ""home"" so that they could make a living of what they were good at."
1,"A Long, Grueling Trip","The novel On the Way Home by Laura Ingalls Wilder should not be read by middle schoolers because of the lack of suspence and excitment. Laura wrote her diary with too much detail, making the story drag on very slowly. She refered to trends that were popular in her era but hard to explain now. One of the examples is the song, Ta-ra-ra Boom! de-ay! Also, the book mentions fire mats. Putting the book on the required reading list for middle school students is forcing the student to read it."
2,On the way to a bad review,"On the way Home by Laura Ingalls Wilder, should not be read by anyone at any age because of its lack of overall fun. It was one of the most boring books ever written. Laura Ingalls Wilder did not explain anything about where she was, what she was doing, and what was going on at the time. For example: She did not explain very well about how they got food and water out in the meadows and deserts of the midwest. She also didn't give much detail about their transportation and what they would do if it failed them. the strory line trailed off into nowhere many times leaving the reader at a confusing endpoint. Overall this book should be thrown out of every library in the United States."
4,Worth reading for the introduction!,"This Laura Ingalls Wilder diary is somewhat dull in parts, but the introduction by her daugher, Rose Wilder Lane, is worth the price of the book. Lane gives a first-hand account of the days before and after the journey that puts Laura in a new light. There are also several good photographs unavailable in other LHOTP books."
4,"Good, but not Wood","Gordon Wood has a unique talent for synthesis and interpretation. The genesis of the American Revolution is incredibly complex, yet Wood conveys the sense of the Revolution in swift and sure brushstrokes in this book. Accordingly, I was disappointed to read in the chronology of the Revolution that Cornwallis surrendered to Washington at Yorktown, Pennsylvania.Hello, editors!B MacPherson"
2,The American Revolution,"The book does not have much detail of raids conducted by the British. Two in particular and the reason I purchased these books were the raiding of Newbedford, whaling fleet and Freetown, Massachusetts there was no mention at all of them."
4,Why we had a revolution in America,"This is a very scholarly review of why we had an American Revolution and the effect it had on our new nation and the world. If you are expecting to read about the War for Independence you will be very disappointed. The war is discussed in its entirety in 13 pages and is not otherwise mentioned elsewhere in the book.Why did we have a revolution in America? The author starts at the end of the French and Indian War and takes the reader through the poor decisions made by the British government at the time in its dealings with the 13 colonies that led so many Americans to revolt.We were the first sovereign nation of any size in modern times to attempt a government without a monarchy in which the people chose to govern themselves. This was a truly revolutionary concept for the time that caused the world to reevalate their own forms of government based on our bold experiment.I enjoyed the book. Although scholarly, it is interesting to read."
3,A nice review of the American Revolution in one short volume,"This slim volume belies its depth. Gordon S. Wood provides a succint-- if dense --account of the origins of the Revolution, its principal actors, and the hard road to the Second Constitutional Convention which followed. All the major military events of the American Revolution are covered-- from the Boston Massacre to Lexington and Concord, to Bunker Hill and Yorktown. A nice refresher on the events which occurred at the beginning of our country."
5,Good,"Good product , delivered on time and arrived as expected. One of the best air fresheners i have used. The product does get used up pretty quick, and the smell is strong immediately after use, but that cannot be helped, i suppose.."
1,terrible,"This is by far the worst RTS I have ever played. There is little to no strategy involved, and the units are obnoxiously loud and irritating. Played it for about 5 minutes before I felt like strangling a baby."
1,COULD NOT GET THIS GAME TO RUN,"Can't truly rate this game. I have a fairly modern system that plays Call of Duty Modern Warefare...another case of maybe the game's required technology being surpassed too quickly? I just could NOT get it to play. So, it's off to the donation bin."
1,Good Product - Bad Shipping,"While the product itself is a great tasting gluten free food. Amazon did not securely ship these fragile crackers. The package comes in a case of 12. When the box arrived to my home, ten of the trays where completely crushed into tiny cracker fragments. Amazon did not make the effort to enclose the crackers in a safe shipping box. And when I looked into returning the crackers, the website informed me that this was a non-returnable product. After further searching on the Amazon website, to find a way to return a damaged product, and not having any luck, I gave up. I ended up using the crackers as cracker crumbles in soups and such - This was not my initial intent. Based on this one bad experience, I will never order another food item through Amazon again."
5,Great,These are great and totally adictive. I agree with other reviews that unfortuantly they do often come a bit broken but I can live with that. The alternative would be to have massives of packaging to protect them and surely we don't want any more excessive packaging.Let's not encourage suppliers to do that. What's a broken cracker compared to a broken planet?I just save the whole ones for entertaining and enjoy the broken ones as my snack! They are delicious whole or broken!
5,My most favorite Cracker!!!,These crackers are DELICIOUS!!!!I bought some at my local organic food mart for $4.25 a pack. I searched Amazon and now can buy them a case at a time for about $3.36 a pack. WHAT A GREAT DEAL!!These crackers have the best taste. They are addicting. They go great with many cheeses and wines. I really love them.
3,"Okay vise, lousy customer service","The box this came in was torn up during shipping. The vise had some missing paint, and this baby is sticky! It feels like some type of hardened grease all over it. I asked Jet for some advise on removing it, but they chose not to answer. The reason I asked their advice is that the red paint seems to rub off on everything it comes in contact with. I wouldn't have expected that from a powder-coated steel item.The other problem is attaching this to your bench. No instructions or hardware are included. I managed to figure it all out, and it seems to be a competent vise. However, I asked Jet what hole sizes they use on the faceplates (as they are larger than 1/4-20) so that I could attach wooden faces. They declined to comment. Thanks Jet for your awesome customer service!"
2,didn't fulfill my needs,"This may be a great product for laying outdoor carpet on a typical flat surface. However, I needed to wrap the carpet around 2"" aluminum posts for a kayak rack. The adhesive was not up to the challenge. I also tried duck tape indoor outdoor carpet tape which failed as well. The only thing that was strong enough to hold the bend in the outdoor carpet was industrial strength velcro. I am now using that on all 10 arms of the 5 place kayak rack"
2,A good idea that missed the mark.,"What could have been developed into a rewarding digression from the established mythology instead fatally suffers from pedestrianism. This books reads like the author just finished a writer's workshop. Trite, unoriginal writing leaves the reader wondering whether to turn the page or stop wasting time and move on to something more worthwhile. Not to mention the abundant typos in the printing. Argh. If you want something along this line, pick up Kazantzakis' 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. You'll find your time far better spent with someone who truly knows his craft."
3,More missing pieces,"Christmas present arrived in what appears to be factory sealed cellophane so I don't think it's an Amazon restock. One lock nut is missing and one guide is missing, but a duplicate of another guide is in the box. What I did get seems of good quality. Guess I'll call Milwaukee or Amazon after the holidays and see how they respond."
5,buildright,"I,ve found the templet guides are very easy to use, clearly marked with the I.D. and O.D. this is very usefull in setting up your work."
3,Bushings,"Very nice case. The quality of the bushings seems good, they do what they are supposed to do. The rating is only three stars because the barrels are too long on the larger diameter bushings. I don't see an application where the long barrel would be useful. I had to cut mine down to get them to work with normal 1/4 inch templates. Since they've been cut they loose their plating and will start to rust. I'd buy the brass ones if I buy another set."
3,Wayyyyyy overpriced.,You can buy this for the regular price of$6.99-7.99 a 6 pack at the grocery store.It goes on sale a lot cheaper.
4,Easy Breakfast Relacement,I really liked the way this drink worked. Drink it for breakfast and I wasn't hungry at all until lunch time. :)
5,coffe ensure,"Ensure is a great product. I put it in a blender with ice cubes and some almond butter and it makes a delicious shake. It puts some calories and needed vitamins and minerals into my diet. Now, if they sold chocolate I would really be happy!"
5,Mom loves this,My mom loves this flavor and it's not easy to find. She's 89 with some dementia and won't drink any of the other flavors but this one I can pass off as coffee.
1,5 Stars for Music. 1 Star for copy protection.,This CD (and all published by Edel since summer of 2002) use copy protection. It cannot be played on a computer. This CD is being returned to Amazon as defective.Shame on you for selling it in the first place......
1,Amazon Screwed Up On This One,"I spend perhaps $10,000 a year with Amazon and rarely have I ever been unhappy. But after paying top dollar for this cd I was very unhappy to find that I cant put it on my Ipod. I am a Cruise ship worker, I have no ""home"" so I put music on ipod and leave CD's in storage. This is a total waste of $25 for me."
1,Thanks for nothing,"I have no idea how this CD sounds, as it will not play on my computer. My computer is my only source of playing CDs. I also will be sending mine back and would hope in the near future that customers will be warned about this before purchase. If they can make a CD that cannot be played on a computer, can they not make one that can be played but not burned or copied? VCR tapes have figured this technology out, why not CD manufacturers? I am so disappointed."
2,Disappointing,These are pretty earrings but I also feel the picture is misleading. I appreciate the picture posted by Starsage: it's a good representation of the earrings. I'm sending these back because they just weren't what I expected.
5,"Practical, no-nonsense guide to living abroad","I wasn't sure what to expect with a book like this. Would the authors be so in love with Italy that they wouldn't be objective? Would they have had such bad experiences that they had nothing good to say about the country? I was pleasantly surprised to see an objective, thoughtful commentary on what you can reasonably expect to find living in Italy. Helpful tips, amusing anecdotes, loads of further resources, and practical--yet encouraging--advice. Recommended!"
5,Very thorough and helpful,"This book is great because it gives you things from an American perspective. I've lived in Italy before on a study abroad program, so I was familiar with some things, but the lists of contact information alone are enough reason to buy this book. It covers everything from student visas to getting dual citizenship and from teaching ESL to starting your own business. A must read for anyone thinking about moving to Italy."
2,Who knows if it is working,"No one can tell me of the product is working or not. There is no test. Last night it started going off for no reason every 5 minutes. It took me almost 2 hours to figure out it was this and not one of the 10 smoke detectors in my house. I finally had to disconnect it and now I cant arm the alarm in the house till my alarm company comes out today to replace this piece of crap. ADT charged $200 for this thing, at least my new company will replace it at no charge."
4,CO Detector,"I had to replace the CO Detector wired into my ADT System. This is an exact replacement. I was disappointed to find that all of these detectors ""expire"" in five years. So I hope it will be available when I need one five years from now. If not I'm sure I will pay a lot more for something that will work with my system."
4,great gift idea,this was a great gift idea for my 2 year old who is really big into construction vehicles. Able to watch again and again!
5,"A treat for anyone who loves to watch earth-moving vehicles skillfully operate, regardless of age","John Deere Earth Mover Action is a DVD children are sure to enjoy. Featuring live-action footage of actual John Deere construction vehicles, John Deere Earth Mover Action includes a ""let's pretend"" game that puts the viewer in the shoes of one who operates earthmoving machines, and lively, humorous tunes by award-winning singer and songwriter James Coffey. A treat for anyone who loves to watch earth-moving vehicles skillfully operate, regardless of age. 40 minutes."
5,My grandson loves it,It was a gift for my 3 year grandson and the videos can keep him occupied in a car for hours so they can take that long ride and come see me.
3,JD Earth Mover DVD,I bought this DVD for my 4 1/2 year old grandson to watch. It only kept his interest for about 5 minutes then he was off doing something else. I don't believe that he will want to watch it again. Although I did like the candy parts!
5,mom of 2,"great video for my 2 year old son. he loves it, it keeps him busy and very interested he has the john deere collection"
3,"Good for casual fan, otherwise don't bother","This single disc takes highlights from the two separate double disc Aquarius sets released by Bright Midnight Records (through the Doors' website) in the past few years.Die hard fans who want everything will go out and buy the two, complete concerts from Bright Midnight. If you don't want to spend, then this would be a good pickup. Just keep in mind you're hearing selections, not a complete show.Of course, when it comes to releasing the same material in various forms as different products, the Doors have few rivals. (The Who come to mind). They release boxsets and then selection discs from boxsets, single and double disc best ofs and greatest hits.Great music, just decide how much of it you want."
5,great live concert,"In the USA, this album was released on Rhino handmade, with a completely different cover.The import(which is the same concert) has a different cover, same show. Great show too, the Doors at the aquarius, 1969. Jim was in great sprits and form and that came out in this show."
1,This Tape Dispenser is awful,"The clear packing tape gets stuck on the metal guide each time I try to use it. Most dispensers of this type have a flexible or hinged guide, this one is unmoveable and evidently welds itslef to packing tape. It's useless."
2,Don't buy this model,I bought this item when I'm moving. The dispensing mechanism is not adjustable. Spend few extra dollars and buy a better one.
1,Does not work well,The tape constantly gets stuck on the handle or the blade under the roller. It often recoils back onto the reel. It might work with heavy tape like book tape but that's not the point. We finally took ours apart to try and repair it but it's no use. We bought the tan-colored 3M model and it works well.
2,Difficult to use,"I've seen these with the Duck and Tartan brand, and mine is labeled ""Manco"", but they're all obviously the same model. The good news is that it feeds the tape O.K. The bad news is that it won't cut it. I bent the plastic panel at the top out of the way and that helped, but it's still difficult, and the tape tends to whip back onto the roll, making it very tedious to use."
5,Great Dispenser,"Dispenser is very easy to use. It doesn't get jammed up, and allows you to go much faster than cutting each piece of tape by hand."
5,Does the job real well!,It is light weight and excellent for taping up packages. Be careful because the razors to cut the tape are extremely sharp. I have cut my finger several times and it hurts :(
4,LOOOOVEE!,"These are so super cute. They are fashionable statement for someone who doesn't want the commitment of a real cartilage piercing. I get many compliments. I wear one at a time, and they look very real from a fair distance. If I wear for too long, they do make my ear hurt a little bit."
3,Ear cuff,"These cuffs are a great alternative to getting a piercing. They are not as comfortable as most reviewers say they are. After wearing them awhile I can feel some pain in the area where the cuff is. Not sure if it's because it's too tight or not because I can still move the piece around freely without give. Used to wear it everyday, now it is just a few days a week.Also, for the price, it is a little bit high if you factor in shipping cost as well. The bag it comes in may seem like a good deal, but the bag itself isn't great or even that useful."
5,Too cute,"I got these ear cuffs in the mail, I wasn't expecting much from them since I've had other ear cuffs and they were always too small. These were much larger and allowed for more adjusting. I can see why some people are hesitant about these as they are thin and bending them over and over would probably tear them. However, once you find a comfortable shape for your ears, you never have to readjust them. The rounded edges made it so it doesn't hurt my ears and I easily sleep with them on. These are a low priced and good quality pair and will definitely purchase these again."
2,not worth the money,"I have turned quite a bit and have always used full sized tools. There were a few times when I needed to reach into a small space, so I ended up purchasing the mini tools. I have almost all Jet tools (lathe, table saw, band saw, sanders, etc.), so I didn't have any issues purchasing the Jet mini tools. After using them a few times, I would have to say that they are nice ""toys"" at best. I have used the parting tool and the skew most and the other tools are to flimsy to do anything with. I have ended up using a sharpened screwdriver for hard to reach places with much better results. Spend your money on some cheap screwdrivers and save the other $40 bucks for something else."
2,Flimsy,"I'm disappointed in the tools. I've had them for two years and rarely use them. I make a lot of pens and bottle stoppers. These tools were a waste of my money. I prefer a more stable ""normal"" size tool and can do fine work with them easier than with this set. It just vibrates too easily for me."
5,Excellent Seller,"I have used this seller before and I actually look for them when I'm shopping. They are reliable, fast, accurate, timely, courteous, and their prices are excellent."
3,Light Reading,"It may not be insignificant that sample pages are not posted for this book. I stopped by a local store to compare candidate books and found this one rather lacking for my purposes. The page layout is such that the wide, empty margins leave about 1/3 of the page empty. This is what my son does in school when he can't quite reach his page limit. Since there is a more advanced book in this series, the more advanced topics that you find in other books are not covered here. Dreamweaer MX 2004 Bible and Dreamweaver 2004 MX: The Missing Manual both looked more substantive and comprehensive."
3,This manual should come with Dreamweaver,I bought this book by mistake. I have a good basic understanding of Dreamweaver and this book is of no use to me. In fact this is the manual that should come with Dreamweaver. Very easy to use and follow but offers nothing to anyone who has gotten past the basics.
5,Makes It Easy To Build A Website,Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004: Training from the Source (3rd Edition)This would have to be the easiest way to get basic knowledge about building and maintaining your very own website.Macromedia MX 2004 training from the source 3rd edition was my first exposure to trying to create a website from scratch and I could not believe how easy it was to do. All the information is laid out for you in step by step instructions that you can easily follow and implement.Before purchasing this book I had looked at attending courses to learn web design which would have cost me thousands of dollars so I am very glad I didn't as most of the information in the book was what I would have learned in the web design course.This is a must have book if you are interested at all in starting your own website...It is easy to read and follow and also has what the finished website should look like so you know you are getting it right... I highly recommend it.
4,Helped me build my website,"This is a pretty good tutorial on using Dreamweaver. The different chapters illuminate various ways of building and organizing your pages. After following the lessons, you can see which method will work for you depending on your desired results and the complexity of your site. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to use Dreamweaver."
2,Disappointed,"I just love these shoes, but there has to be a design flaw with the heels because I have purchased several pairs and the heels always crack in the same place. I don't know how to solve this problem because I just love the way the shoe fits my feet!"
5,EASY TO USE,"This is good tape....would try to find something alittle stronger for packing boxes...but otherwise good, and it is easy to use."
5,The Best Tape,This is the best tape ever. It's easy to use and tear. A few minutes with another tape with the metal razor edge and you quickly will miss this tape. Can't say enough good things. Thanks Amazon.
1,Worst company ever,"I ordered the chair in the beginning of December, and recieved the wrong chair. I called FansEdge immediately and they assured me they were going to ship out the chair that day. After eight phone calls in a month and a half they finally told me they stopped making the chair. FanEdges through Amazon is by far the worst experience I had when trying to buy something."
3,"Mostly out of date, with the release of Photoshop 5","This book was required for a class that I am taking, and, frankly, it should not have been. With the introduction of Photoshop 5, much of its special 'work arounds' for web professionals are no longer necessary. For example, adding a drop shadow to an image is now as easy as clicking on Filters > Drop Shadows.But this book was written when Photoshop 4 was still the newest kid in town, and has nearly two pages of instructions to create a drop shadow effect.If O'Reilly updates the book for the Photoshop 5 release, I'd recommend buying it. Otherwise, I'd stick with something a bit more current.Review written 5-20-99"
4,Photoshop for The Web,This book has great real world examples. It has easy to follow examples and case studies from real web preofessionals. I found it easy to follow and very helpful in day to day production. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in producing images for the web.
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper...","I must admit, I'm a sucker for trilogies.... it's always nice to see continuity with characters and for them to be further developed than in just one story. Although ""Little Miss Innocent?"" is really good, by the time you get to ""Messing Around with Max"" you're left wondering why your wasting your time."
4,Great lazy day read..,"This is a great book for a day by the pool, beach or home on the couch. Little Miss Innocent was great, but stories two and three were pretty predictable after the first. In general it was nothing less than what I've come to expect from Lori Foster. Her stories are vivid and really take you into the lives, hearts and minds of the characters."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of Lori Foster and have enjoyed reading almost all of her books, but this one was disappointing. I agree with the reviewer who says that it starts strong but fizzles out. I don't understand all the 5 star rattings."
1,Suckfest!,"I don't get it, I was amped up to read Tempted, I dig Lori Foster, I actually checked out the ratings before I bought it. I was suckered into Back in Black and it was a total fail. Tempted, TOTAL FAIL!"
3,"Comfortable, just not very durable...","Got a pair of these to replace mechanics gloves while working in cold/wet weather. They fit snugly, keep your hands warm in 20-30 degree weather, and still allow for good dexterity while operating equipment, hand tools, etc.However, after only 3 days of use, the palms have begun to tear and separate. Instead of being made into the glove or stitched on, they're very poorly glued together."
2,Weak Seam,"Recently purchased these gloves as a result of the storms in the Northeast this year. Used them today, 02/21/2011 while shoveling and clearing snow. The seam between the thumb and fore finger on the right hand seperated creating a hole. I have worked with Stearns equipment as a Police Officer I have used the Ice Rescue suit which is why I purchased the Stearns gloves. This is obviously a great disappointment.Frank J Kiernan"
4,Excellent pop,"I thought that Loving Arms really broke this artist through. He's been around a couple of albums, but this song tells me the kind of artist he is. Very melodic pop, with an emphasis on vocals and lyrics. Radio played this song in 1994 a lot, and it still is in my head to this day. So Darden, if you're reading this, you are talented and you deserve far more exposure."
3,Decent Paint Remover,"If you have light work with minimal layers of paint this is a cool sander. Otherwise, if you are not careful you can gouge soft woods like pine or you can really burn old latex paints. This works best with high-speed drills. The higher the better. If you try to use this sander with the $50 Black and Decker you got from Target, it's probably not going to work as well. There are other sanders such as this on the market. This sander is very similar to a scouring pad you may use to clean pots and pans. If you need something harder than a scouring pad, this is not a pick although its cheap enough to buy and have if you ever need it. All the sanders like this I have seen run for less than $15."
4,Definitely Works,Just follow the instructions and use an electric drill - not battery operated...needs speed. Removed old paint splotches from natural wood deck. Very pleased with results.
5,Great Book For Imformation,"This book has a lot of imformation on every single muscle car, but their isn't anything on the Corvette which was once a muscle car. Their is great pictures. The way the cars are described is really good. It even has a price, and a horsepower guide and everything else about the best cars ever built. This is a Great Book. Buy It!!!"
2,Sex and Self Pity,"Gloria Greene is smart -- or so she keeps insisting. In view of this, her capacity for banal friends, conduct, and conversation is truly amazing. Her displays of high I.Q. veer between telling us that she is Very Beautiful and reminding us (again) that she is Very Intelligent. She also spends a lot of time assuring us that it's a burden to be both Very Beautiful and Very Intelligent. If only her intelligence were allowed to animate any of her actions, thoughts, or dialogue, this might have been workable satire. As it is, the reader figures out the plot long before those plodders at the F.B.I., and is left wondering how a character as vapid as Gloria could have captured the author's imagination for more than five minutes."
1,A Stunning Exploration of Hypocrisy,"Several years ago, while in college, Keats published a column arguing that paperback books impugned the dignity of the written word. If you can't afford to buy a hardcover, Keats stated, you probably are better off not reading. Now, with the release of his direct-to-paperback novel, Keats appears to have changed his mind. Insight into the human condition, indeed."
5,THIS ARE IT,"As can be seen by some of the reviews, this goes waaaaaay over some peoples heads. For others, it changes lives. I am of the latter category, and i will never be the same after having read this book."
2,not very helpful,"I checked this book out from my local library because Dadaism was mentioned in my Design class, and it sounded interesting. I wanted to learn more about it. I found this book to be very confusing and not very informative at all. It seems that they wrote this so abstract on purpose (which they may have). Although the final essay, lecture on dada, was informative and the essay was, on poetry, was very good. I'd recommend this book just for those two lampistries."
3,Sweet Movie,"This is a good family movie. Kind of nice to see David Soul playing a nice ""normal"" man."
5,Good gift idea,This was actually purchased as a Christmas gift for my boss. He was definitely happy with receiving it!
2,Great cast but a second rate show,"Keith Carradine is wonderful as Will Rogers. Dee Hoty is great as Will's patient Wife. The score, by Cy Coleman, Betty Comden and Adolph Green is variable but has no real stand-out moments, and doesn't really tell the story. Instead the songs provided Tommy Tune an oportunity to choreograph some wonderful numbers..which we can't see on the CD. With show long closed and not likely for revival, this is a CD for either collectors of Cy Coleman scores or fans who want every Tony award winning musical."
3,One of the truly bipolar musicals,"...What a show. It is hard to listen straight thorugh this soundtrack because some of the songs are really awful. The theme song, for instance, ends the show (both on the CD and on stage) in a very unsatisfying manner. However, whenever Betty Blake is on stage or on the CD, this musical is very enjoyable. Her three solo songs are all extremely enjoyable, and Dee Hoty does a wonderful job on this CD. The plot (if it can be called that) is bland and uninteresting; undoubtedly Will Rogers was an intriguing person, but this musical does not portray him as anything more than a ""nice guy"". Go to itunes and buy the Betty Blake songs--anything more and you will be disappointed."
2,I wonder what Will would have thought of this show?,"The original cast tries hard on this soundtrack but they are stuck with a particularly weak group of songs, far from Comden and Green's usual standards. Keith Carradine does a fine job capturing the ""aw shucks"" quality of Rogers, but with exception of his theme song (""I Never Met a Man I Didn't Like"") he has precious little to work with. This was a big hit years ago, but it really doesn't stand up against Broadway's better musicals. Will deserves better."
5,Great Score !,"Desite enjoying this show back in '91, I didn't understand how it beat ""Miss Saigon"" for the ""Best Musical"" Tony. The production, cast, and songs were great, but something seemed missing. Maybe it just seemed ""small"" compared to the British-invasion musicals dominating at the time (""Phantom"", ""Le Miz""). Tony voters obviously liked the change.Twenty plus years later, however, the songs in this score continue to shine and make for a great listen! Best tracks include:Willamania [very peppy & one of my favorite theatre songs ever]Give A Man Enough RopeIt's A BoyMy Big MistakeOur Favorite SonNo Man Left For MeNever Met A Man I Didn't Like [great eleven o'clock number!]Hopefully, this show will return as a revival on Broadway sometime soon!"
5,Will Rogers Follies on CD,This CD was very enjoyable. The songs were fun. I recomend it to anyone who enjoys broadway musicals.
2,Makes Player Bulky,It is made of thick rubber and increases the size of the player. At first i thought this skin makes the player look good and if it is made of other meterials it may try of being look good. It also prevents only the back of the player not the screen. I need to buy another protective skin separetely to protect the screen. It seems like front part will easily tear if it not used properly. Overall it is worth in weight and lacks the look.
4,Serves a porpuse,"I'm buying this for specific porpuse to. Im goin over sees and have a need for holding all mymovie. Great Screen Quality, built in Speaker is cool to. has proprietary software and have to go thru software to upload moives and such and only supports limited file formats. Otherwise Awsome product"
4,A Journalist Takes a Train,"Andrew Eames discovers a legendary celebrity in Syria, when he expected to find her in London. He sets out on a journey on the eve of the Iraq war to trace the travels of Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan.The is one of the few travel books I've every read and it is exceptionally well written.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,A Stunning New Perspective,"Considering that the author and title of this book are both respectable, I knew I had to check this work out.About 1/3 of the way through, the book became so philosophical and metaphorical that I had to actually take a break from the book and cool it for a few days. The book actually had me somewhat frustrated with my current beliefs and the perspective Manly P Hall was bringing in.However, with time and lots of thought I have come to completely appreciate and admire his perspective and this book. I really think Manly P Hall brings forth and excellent way to understand our Bible.I would recommend this book to anybody looking to broaden and enhance their understanding of the world's most popular book."
1,Junk,"Worst Framing tool I have ever used.1. The neck is so small you can only use it on a board 2"" wide at most.2. Flexible Framers points are barely inserted, so any bending (like what they are meant for) causes them to come out.3. After using it on 3 frames the cap broke off.Such a worthless piece of junk!!!! Save your money and go with Fleximaster!"
3,Lost something in the translation?,"This is a well written, a nice little book, and I enjoyed it. But something was missing-- an essense, a soul, a heart? Perhaps a woman's coming of age tale set in France, translated from the Italian by a man made a difference, and lost something in the translation of language, culture and gender. While I enjoyed the little written ""paintings"" the book seemed almost sterile or cold. Linda Ferri's book is probably much more enjoyable in it's original language.It's certainly worth a read though!"
2,Neat but disappointing,"I bought this as a gift for a family member who's a huge NASCAR fan. Unfortunately I left the item boxed until late Christmas eve. When I removed it from the Amazon box, I was surprised to see how poorly packaged it was. The product had virtually no packaging and was simply in a clear plastic bag! The quality of the flags and stand were reminiscent of Made in who knows what country. Overall very cheap build quality mixed with even cheaper packaging equated to a very nervous gifting experience. The picture shown above depicts the flags on a professional appearing desk giving the impression of quality and something worthy of an adults ""desk space"". In reality, this item is much better suited as a decoration in a child's room. I say decoration because the flags wouldn't last with much playtime from an average male child."
1,Learn What ASP Is But Don't Count of Learning How to Program,"I recommend this book to anyone trying to figure what ASP script is all about and how to apply it to business related applications. BUT, (and this is a huge WARNING) don't think that the CODE supplied in this book is going to help you because it WON'T. I've tried half of the code, thinking I was up for moderate twinking and modification (I'm an Intermediate ASP Writer), and it turns out this code wouldn't work if Greg Buczek was standing there infront of you! ....I've found plenty of scripts from other ASP books and online sites that have worked great..."
5,This book is great for beginners,I am new to ASP and this book is great help for a beginner. It has plenty of useful codes that can be implemented into your pages. Just copy and paste and change the fields and tables to fit your needs. It was a great purchase and I would recommend it to any beginner!
5,Very practical content!,"I really like the content of this book. I'm new to ASP and this book has very applicable examples of all the functionalities I would ever want to put in a website. Examples include member login, queries, securing your database, setting up an online campus, submitting requisitions, online ordering, etc. It even has fun features such as creating and sending an e-vite card to someone. The book comes with a CD that has all the example code. And every significant bit of script is explained in detail in this book. If you've ever wondered how to script something but didn't have the patience to wade through textbooks presented in dull theory format, then look no further. This book covers the basics of ASP in the first two chapters. The rest of the thick book is organized by task--what you want to make your website do. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Beginners, beware!! This book teaches you the wrong way ...","Advantages: Most of the scripts work. Some provide simple solutions to relatively complex problems.Disadvantages: Scripts are primitive. They can help to start, but cannot provide you polished finish products. The biggest problem is database design. Some of the design, such as corporate library, violates every forms of database design standards. Beginners! Please beware. It is important that you learn the right way to have a solid foundation to move on."
2,The same techniques over and over and over,"The book shows you a couple of techniques. But the same techniques are applied over and over on the different scripts. Not all the techniques work. The INSERT or UPDATE SQL statements would not work if there are too many single and double quotes. For example, try using INSERT or UPDATE with text data like - Mr. O'Brien's girlfriend said, ""Hi, it's me!"". The quotes and single quotes would really mess up any SQL statement. Also, you have to change the connect string to use Microsoft Access, a fact not mentioned in my copy of the book / CD."
2,*** Sloppy ACCESS database***,"I have mixed feelings about this book.It's well written and relatively easy to follow. I particularly liked the authors presentation of 'Database Server Components' end of the second chapter.HOWEVER, the ACCESS databases on the CD must have been 'slapped together' at the last minute!*Some tables are completely missing!*Relationships haven't been mapped!etc...In all fairness I didn't try to execute the SQL Server scripts, I had a big enough headache with ACCESS.Buyer beware...."
1,Careful with the good reviews,"People tend to rate a book highly if they already are familiar with the content, and use it as a reference. As a learning tool, however, Buczek forgets that the world isn't an ASP expert at about page 8 where he just leapfrogs into ASP jargon and stops introducing new terminology, and just starts using it. Very inconsistent, and very incomplete. He breaks the scripts down, but ignores about 25% of the code as though it's not worth mentioning. It's quite bizarre, save your money."
4,Excellent way to learn ASP scripting,"When I purchased this book I was fair in ASP, but lacked the ability to put together my knowledge to perform complex or multilevel tasks. By reading through the scripts that seemed most relevant to the kind of work I was doing, I learned a great deal and got an excellent jump on building bigger and better scipts and applications. This book should come with a caution - some of the programing is not what I (or most) would consider efficient or the most effective way to do things. This is relatively easy to overcome if you have a good grasp of ASP and can simply rewrite parts of the code."
1,Total Garbage,"This book is the worst waste of time. The scripts in here are lousy examples if how to program correctly and even though they are totally simplistic bush-league drivel most of them don't even work properly. Some of the scripts are no more than 10 lines of code and at that they don't even work properly.No of the examples are plug-n-play... there is always a little something which doesn't work properly. My biggest complaint is that these are not ""true"" applications. Most of them don't have insert-update-delete backends to them... it's all just front-end show.This book is worse than useless... it's dangerous to learn proper programming."
2,Not so good as it seems,When I bought this book I thought that it would be helpful and interesting. But I found it really boring. It has millons of examples and when you have read 100 pages of it you will know the same that if tou read the 800 pages. I recomend it for really beginners in ASP.
5,Not the typical text book,If you learn best by example this book is the one!. It's not the only book you will need for ASP but the code is explained in full.
3,"good, coupled with disciplined practices","The author provides cool ideas and even some quick ways to implement them. The book should be appreciated for what it is: an ambitious asp cookbook. It's up to you as the developer to apply sound architecture and clean code. What database you use, and what coding methodology you follow, are hardly the point of this book(""Instant ASP"").This book is definitely more appropriate for developers who already have a grasp of asp programming - its value is in its practicality."
3,good for it's ideas,"The code is inelegant. However, the scope of the book and concepts that are covered is impressive (chat, basic help desk/hr admin system). If you have some asp experience this book can be quite insightful - if not then there are perhaps more formal/conventional sources to start with. It would have been nice if the author treated oracle rather than access."
4,Great for getting the juices going.,"Sparing precious little time on fundamentals you jump right into a series of web site examples that really get you thinking how you could apply it to your own situation. I started reading to figure out how to approach two or three problems and wound up getting ideas for another half-dozen features for my website.As for learing ASP ... it would be good to have another reference that discussed in greater detail syntax, properties, methods, etc. If you already have a good foundation in object methodology and web functioning, the this ""learn by using"" approach should work for you."
5,Excellent Resource for beginners and intemdiate developers,"I have been trying to learn asp from a lot of resources and found alot of gabarge on the market. This has to be the best book every written about asp. I don't see how you could have anything negative to see about it. Sure it talks about database stuff that you should already know, or just get a book on database how to then connect the asp to the database you created. Some one ought to give this author an award since he cuts through the chase. Excellent resource."
5,Tons of Examples,I'm very impressed. I tried out some examples and thought they won't work but the worked great. I needed the library to work from an access database so I created the tables in access and it still worked. But most important is the large number of examples give me other new ideas too.
5,"All major concepts in one place, with examples - GREAT!","The author obviously teaches - his insight into the questions that occurred to me as the concepts were presented is outstanding - like he was anticipating. I find the book to have many good code examples, solid dicussion of those examples - and now I'm really actually doing ""Instant"" ASP - thanks!"
2,Something is missing?,Gosh - this book would've been perfect but it came with no databases??? Good sample scripts! Wonderful! Would've been extra nice to also add a small section for access DB users.
3,"Good BEGINNER concepts, but code is garbage","This book is definitely a beginner's guide on how to think about dynamic programming on the web using ASP. However, the code is absolute garbage. You should never put any code in this book into global production, as it will eventually fail and never be up to par with a full featured enterprise application. Seasoned ASP programmers should be appalled at the code logic displayed in this book."
3,Instant ASP Scripts,"The book is a little hard to follow if you have no previouos experience. Mr Buczek is trying to teach by example but none of his examples can be run. All of the samples are on the CD, however none of the corresponding databases are on the CD. Since ASP is 90% database integration, I consider this a serious mistake on the author's part. I checked the publishers website for the databases but they aren't there either. The database structures can be found in the book. Perhaps I'm lazy but, I don't want to create and fill in the databases. In order to see how the examples work, I have to. What it comes down to is that the CD is useless, and Mr Buczek is just another text book teacher."
5,"Structured very well, SQL and VB intensive","The book is excellent apart from missing a couple of critical parts. It could have had a few pages on Access Databases and also it could have had a few pages on javascripted asp and the set up of it. As I am a intermediate java programmer with no VB skills, some areas where very grey when converting them over or just doing plain VB was difficult. Overall it is a very good book and I only bought it after reading the reviews on amazon.com. It is worthy of the 5 stars since most books cannot match the way it is taught. This book combined with some other urls (ie www.activeserverpages.com/learn/toc.asp ) it is very useful. I can recommend a book with this consistent teaching applied."
5,Thank you Mr Buczek for a great practical learning ASP book!,"I will send my great thanks to Mr Greg Buczek for an excellent and very good practical learning book ! I have read a great deal of the lately outcomming ASP book collections and I will say this is the best ! It is well structured and the different elements are presented in a crystal clear fashion. This is the book I needed to better understand how to doing the practical application of ASP. I recommend this book for sure ! Five stars !Again many thanks to the author, and I waiting for his new book comming soon !"
3,Not for beginners,"I bought this book because the examples seemed very practical. However, I had a lot of trouble to make the examples work, actually I haven't been able to make them work. Some of the example files (Access Databases) are missing. I am in the beginning stage of learning ASP. I thought that since the author explains almost every line of code, I would be able to learn something. I was wrong. I had to go back to Amazon.com and buy two more books so I could have a background and then I will probably come back to this book again.I am giving 3 stars because some of the examples in the book seemed to have not been tested before publishing."
1,Funny but where's the facts?,"While I liked the author's humor, the book barely presented anything of value to me. As a long-time Windows user I thought this book would give me a quick tour of what to expect in OS X. After reading four chapters I just couldn't take any more and returned it. So far I've learned more in the first few pages of Pogue's ""The Missing Manual"" than I did in the first few chapters of this book."
5,Beautiful Voice!,"The first time I heard Beverley Craven was back in 1991 on KKSF in San Francisco. She has such a soothing sound unlike anyone I've heard before. ""Joey"", ""Promise Me"" & ""Holding On"" are really best songs on this CD. Consider listening to this British songstress!"
5,great food supplement,This product tastes great and helps me maintain my weight as my work demands moving a lot.
5,Great Book,"The first book is a little depressing. Catsby is a sad, and pissed character, it is a great book. A lot of the situations are real life, and easy to relate to.I just had to read the 2nd one, and I just ordered the 3rd and 4th"
3,Good Source,"Not out of print. Reprinted in 1991, 1998, and 2000 by Clearfield Company, Inc., by Genealogical Publishing CO., Inc., 1001 N. Calvert Street, Baltimore, MD 21202.Good resource if your family line is there. Found some information on Ninian Beall, his father and grandfather. They were weavers in Scotland! A confusing marriage date is listed in the book but no information on my line through Ninian's Rachel."
5,Lord of bass,This is Stanley Clarke at the height of his career playing a mixture of funk jazz and rock to large crowds around the world.
3,OK but adhesive is not sticky enough,I am not sure this characteristic is characteristic of all painter's tape. I found that the adhesive was not strong enough if one wanted to use it for tasks other than protecting areas of the wall that one did not want painted.
5,Excellent battery,"I bought this battery for my 1978 BMW R100S based on recommendations from the guy I bought the bike from. I'm glad I did. I have had the battery for a month now and it works great.The only concern I had initially was having to put acid in and charge it myself, since I have never done this. Using common sense, following instructions and being careful is a recipe for success. I already had the correct type of battery charger, so that was one expense I wouldn't have to add. Just make sure you note that you need 54.1 ounces of battery acid that you can buy at most auto supply stores. Battery acid comes in different density of electrolyte which for this battery is 1.260 (1.280) for temperate climates and a little lower for tropical climates (1.240). It can vary by a small amount.My next purchase will be a Yuasa Smart Shot battery charger (trickle) 12v, 900mA to maintain the charge during winter months."
4,Good Card,This is a very good sound card. You can have a real sound improvement with this card on your device. However you must be patience with it. Not very easy for switching from headset to speakers and vice versa also it increase its temperature a lot during regular use. I love this card but you must get used to it.
2,Read All Reviews Before Purchasing This Card,"I, along with many others, have experienced ""sound lock-ups"", squeals and computer lock-ups with this card and the others in this series. My sound issues have occurred mostly during games.Sound quality is excellent in Windows and when the card is working properly in games.Most of the issues appear to involve some kind of hardware conflict as most afflicted users have high-end computer systems running SLI, although the problems are not exclusive to these configurations.I am currently working with CL to resolve the issue, but I'm not sure they know what is causing it as this issue has been around since Aug 06.I am not saying ""don't buy"", just be sure you have fully investigated all the issues before making the purchase as I doubt your installation and use with be trouble free."
5,Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Fatal1ty Pro Series Sound Card,Great soundcard! I noticed in Battlefield 2142 that I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better. I'm not getting knifed as often (which is a very good thing!) I'm glad I got this card.
2,More nVidia Problems,I have a X-FI in my Dell XPS 800 which has an nVidia Chip set (and no on board sound). I also have nVidia Graphics cards (8800GTS512). I have been unable to use nVidia Graphics drivers newer than version 169 (they are now up to version 258 - which tells you something right off the bat) because of mysterious conflicts with the XFI sound card resulting in stuttering and lockups. Have spent MANY hours trying to fix this. Even installed a fresh copy of XP on a new hard drive with a clean install of ONLY the newest XFI and NVIDIA drivers. No luck. Dont know who's fault this is but I suggest NOT mixing XFI and NVIDIA based on my experience.
5,worth it,"Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Fatal1ty Pro Series Sound Card ( 70SB046A00000 )Packaged well and securely,was delivered within time frame that amazon said.Put this card in a new computer,went in with no problems.Loaded the software,checked for updates and set up the sound the way i wanted it,was easy to do.Has a varietyof options for mode,balance and style.Tried sound in gamer and entertainment modes and played with the other controls.Installed fast and easy and set up quickly.Games sound great on this card.Highly recommended."
3,So-So,"I love creative products, but sometimes they just price themselves out of usefulness, that and drivers... oh drivers.I went out and tried to fix a sound problem i was having with vista by throwing money at it, i figured well, creative is 'the best' well it turns out, that at this time last year, NOONE had good vista drivers, and well i wasted a bunch of money for no reason. I'm sure vista drivers have came a long way, but i still have a sour taste in my mouth.Anyways, if you have money to burn, it doesn't get better than this card, if you are even remotely worried about dollars per performance, then get a lower end X-Fi, as the sound quality will be identical, and the performance difference will be completely negligible."
5,im liking this for cod4,My old sound card was not providing accurate sound in Call of Duty 4 with headphones. I figured i'd give this a try since i heard the CMSS-3D the x-fi had was great. The sound the x-fi giving me seems to be a bit more accurate than my previous card
5,great sound card,"Wonderful sound, beats the pants off built in sound cards, and rips MP3s like in seconds. Truely amazing sound card, Now a driver improvement by creative would help, as windoze vista drivers suck big time."
1,sound card,Device manager is constantly needing to be reassigned. Is constantly resetting to default. I do not recommend this product.
5,I'm a minutiae guy . This IS the mag for me,"If you REALLY love film (from ALL decades) and of ALL manner , treat youself to this awesome , highly respected and award strewn glossy , digest magazine . It comes to you six times a yr and is a TRUE page turner (even if you think you're not initially interested in a given article) . It's THAT well written . Brilliant ."
4,good deal on used book,"Shipped very fast, exactly as pictured/promised. A+. Bought all these books for a friend for Christmas and they were in good to fine condition and he was happy with them"
4,Solid Sorytelling,"This was my second Mary Sharratt book (the first one I read was Summit Avenue). She has the ability to make characters, locations and eras come vividly to life. The Real Minerva was a thoroughly enjoyable read, the plot really kept me turning the pages. I love how the characters are such strong women, each making their way in life in choosing such different paths.It showcases beautifully the dynamics and conventions of small, rural towns of the era and how those conventions along with gossip and expected ""moral"" behavior impacts the life of the women.A very worthwhile read."
3,The Real Minerva,"Gritty, but hopeful life in a small town. The choices a young woman has to make are realistic and compelling."
4,A Decent Read,"This is an interesting collection of short stories, considering the young age of the author. I was amazed that he has not continued to write more books. The contents of Blue Day certainly screams out that this is indeed a talent worth watching. If anyone knows if there are any more books of his around, let me know. I certainly will look forward to reading more mature works by this gifted writer. I was especially taken by his use of discriptive language. Navarro has the ear of the poet."
1,What would I be getting???,"I am not going to purchase this item, because a list of the songs enclosed is not provided. How are we expected to purchace something such as this, if we are shown what it is that we are purchasing? If there were at least 2 songs on this disc that I wanted... I would purchase it. However, since I have no idea as to what exactly I would be getting, I refuse to purchase."
5,great shoes!,"Both of my children have enjoyed their Robeez, and this pair is no exception. Excellent for little ones - they never fall off!"
4,Nice Rack,"This utensil drying rack fit nicely on my existing chrome dish rack that I've had for a long time. I like it because being so ""open"" allows the utensils to air dry quickly. This is much easier to clean than the former plastic racks I've had, which were difficult because they didn't drain as well as this one. Like it, should give me years of good use."
1,Piece of junk,"I can't believe anyone designed, built and marketed this product. The spacing of the wiring is just perfect for allowing the utensils to fall through."
1,I hate this thing,"I'm on Amazon today looking for a replacement for this. It is sturdy and looks handsome, to be sure, but there are multiple places where your silverware handles will fall through--very annoying!"
3,Just like they said,"Despite what I read, I went ahead and ordered this drainer basket - because I couldn't find any other that ""matched"" my chromed dish drainer. However, its hooks don't match up to have the basket hang as it should, and - like everybody said - the flatware pokes through. It is irritating, and JUST better than nothing at all!"
1,"Nice Rack, Dimensions are WAY Off","I bought three of these to replace the plastic cutlery rack in my dishwasher. The existing rack broke 3 times in the last 3 years, so the plastic obviously isn't working. My present rack's dimensions are 9"" long, 6 "" wide, 5"" deep. So, if these are 8 "" long and 2"" wide, I should be able to zip-tie 3 of these together and get a near-exact fit, right? Nope! The actual dimensions of this rack are (at the top) 7 5/8"" long, 2 "" wide, 4 5/8"" high, or on the bottom 7 "" long by 2 3/8 wide..These seem to be good quality but I'll only give 1 star, because they aren't even close to the size advertised. Given the shipping costs it's not worth returning them, so my money was wasted."
2,Poorly designed,"Like many others have said, to sum it up- good idea, nice price but poorly designed with slots where my flatware falls through. So I see 2 options- find a new utensil drainer with smaller holes in the bottom, or get new silverware. And I'm not getting new silverware."
3,"Nice size, not great design","I like the size, and the hooks that secure this to the dish drainer. But the bottom and bottom sides of the rack are too open, silverware slips through. Less open space on the bottom and bottom corners would be a better design. the price is good."
1,very dissapointed,I ordered this to go along with my new stainless steel drainer that fits perfectly into my new sink. This utensil rack also fits nicely onto my dish drainer but after a few months I noticed that it's rusting!!!!!!! Don't buy this as the rust will transfer onto your utensils. This is the first time I have reviewed a product because I felt so strongly about feeling like I got ripped off on this product.
5,A nice addition.,I purchased this at the same time as I ordered the Rubbermaid Chrome Dish Drainer. The dish drainer comes with a plastic utensil holder but I wanted this as an alternative. I ended up using both and I really like the chrome on chrome look.
5,A Sleeper,"It's really too bad that some books come along that are really worth reading, but perhaps there is little promotion, so besides a little word of mouth, very few ever hear about it and read it. We Really Do Need Each Other is one such book. It is a small book,simply written, but it contains Christian truth worth hearing. It speaks out against spiritual lone rangers, trying desperately to make it in an increasingly confused, scary, and despairing world. Just like pagans, many Christians live lives of silent desperation. Once in a while you come across a believer who says something like: ""Oh, I don't go to church; I don't need it. I enjoy my own private relationship with God."" It's not true. We need one another now more than ever. Check out this book if you can track down a copy."
5,William Kritlow outdid his first in this series....,"If I thought the first book in this series ""Crimson Snow"" was good, this one was even better. This story brings several of the characters from the first book into it. This one was suspenseful from the beginning with some wonderful twists thrown in - a bloody crate...a needle...a chainsaw...an explosion or two...and Mike Grogan isn't who he appears to be. One part wasn't very believable though - battery-operated boats - do they really have those? and did the DEA really think the drug lords wouldn't know they were being followed in those boats?"
1,Wok lid bent,"you are taking a gamble ordering from this vendor. The wok lid we bought arrived bent so as to fit in the box. Sorry, but I couldn't get it round again. I called the shop and they offered a discount but, what a drag. A bent wok lid."
2,Unfortunately very flimsy,"Dropped it, got a huge dent and the lid lost its shape (a gap appeared). Bent it back, it sort of works now. Thicker gauge steel would have done wonders (and I would not mind spending an extra $5 for a cooking utensil that should last for a decade)"
3,No complaints,It's fine. No surprises either way. Arrived quickly. Fits my wok. The wooden knob is kinda nice but otherwise...it's a wok lid. What can be said.
1,Wok Lid,The item is fine but it's way too big and I've used it once then I gave it away. Thanks anyway.
2,Knob attachment could be improved,"The knob came separately, with a small wood screw for attaching it to the lid. But the hole in the lid was almost as big as the screw head, so the attachment would not be very secure and the knob could pull off.I solved it by using a larger screw (#10 x 3/4"" washer head) and drilling out the small hole in the knob to accommodate the larger screw body (I'd risk splitting the hard wooden knob otherwise)."
5,Damn good!,"I admit, even though I'm a big MB20 fan, I was unsure how I'd like ""Tabitha's Secret."" But from the first track,""And Around,"" this CD won me over. The second I heard the first note I knew it was going to be great. This is one damn good CD. The lyrics are amazing. The track ""Dear Joan"" is incredible. Words can not describe it. Rob's voice is very different on this CD than later more polished and processed albums. This is a must buy! It's 5-stars!"
4,Not too bad,"THe music on this cd is slightly different than what most Matchbox Twenty fans are used to. The versions of 3am on the disc are pretty good, although its a shame that the members left in Tabitha's secret had to go after Matchbox Twenty for ""3 a.m."". Just another example of money hungry people ;). Still is an enjoyable cd."
5,anything new is good,"well, i absolutely love tabitha's secret/matchbox-and around and blue monday totally rock! and paint me blue is different but it's good! same with Dizzy... took out a lyric but it's still amazing 'cause you can understand what Rob's saying :Dbut like I said before anything good is new :D"
1,Ouch,"Well there's an hour of my life I'll never get back. I got this out of the bargain bin at a local record store. Being familiar with the band's demos and the whole Matchbox 20 thing, I quickly grabbed it. Much to my dismay, when I put it on, all of the songs had been remixed and ""popped"" up. Seriously, you can hardly call it ""rock"" anymore, let alone ""post-grunge."" All of their original grit is gone. On top of that, the liner notes are just the self-gratification of disgruntled Jay Stanley, embodied by sickeningly cheesy graphics. Go find the original versions of these songs and thank me later.Lesson learned: if a CD is in the bargain bin, it's probably there for a reason. I want my $2.50 back."
2,Just No,"I'm a pretty big matchbox20 fan (have been since '98 or so) and have been into Tabitha's Secret for awhile. I was on the board when Jay Stanley (former TS guitarist) released the Live CD, and when they released this one. And it's not that the songs aren't good.. I love the Tabitha's Secret songs, probably more than anything matchbox20 has done since then, but this is utter crap. All Stanley did was ""remaster"" the old songs by bringing in a long list of studio musicians and making them more palatable to the pop audience. And they weren't that bad quality to begin with! My advice to you is to go buy Don't Play With Matches, to hear what the songs are supposed to sound like. Then if you like that, you can buy this to see what he did to them-- though it might be unpleasant to hear."
2,Get Don't Play WIth Matches,"This is a cheesy remix of the album ""Don't Play With Matches"" in which they tried to capitalize on the MB20 success by making it sound more like the recent albums.DPWM are the songs in their original form and are VASTLY BETTER."
1,False Polarization,"The reviewers apparent polarization about this book gives a false sense of a debatable point of view regarding the work of Werner Erhard. The difference here is that there is the TRUTH, and there is the LIES, and this book is squarely in the lies camp, by selectively choosing that 1% of the facts, and ignoring the rest. Even Mother Theresa would be a war criminal by selective argumentation.The majority of the people, that I know, that have taken the Landmark Course have perhaps followed up with one or two courses, and that's it - there is no cult, or place to hang out. Their marketing department does not call you to sell you a course - and when they did in the past, it was no different than any other marketing organization. And by the way, if you are a complete loser, Landmark is NOT going to solve your problems!Buy this book if you want to be misinformed, or you want to built on your already existing negative, false bias."
2,Poor handle design,"First time I used it, the handle kept coming loose from the valve. Then the valve itself broke off where the handle attaches. There is a very small amount of plastic at this area. This is a really weak spot and will break if you use it much."
4,Pump sprayer,"This is the only place that I could find the pump with the large mouth. It is one of the best if not the best pump that i have every used. The sprayer has a lifetime free replacement of it if sometime goes bad. I had a problem with one of mine and they were suppose to send me a replacement part but it never came, so i called them and they saw where i had checked on it about 2 times so they send me a new sprayer free of charge so it was a good deal for me. I will continue to use them for as long as i can find one like that i love this pump."
4,Quality is worth the price,"After having had a number of less expensive sprayers from the big box stores, I spent more for this one and am not disappointed. The improvement in quality is very noticeable and I expect to get many years of trouble free service from it. I have the two gallon unit and it is not too heavy or awkward to carry or use. The seals are all tight and it does not require a lot of pumping. I cannot rate the actual durability, but will come back and amend this if it fails."
2,Very hard to pressurize,"Had to return, was very hard to get it to pump. Had to hold it between 2 people and still would only only seal erratically. Shame because it looks likea well built product.Could be improved by adding a strap and a lock on the sprayer handle."
3,works fine,"This sprayer is more heavy duty than other ones I've owned, and seems to work well. The side handle is handy to lug it around and the pressure release valve on top is a nice feature to let the pressure out when job is done so it can be opened. Only problem is that the pump handle won't latch down into the top when under pressure so have to carry it by the side handle when spraying."
3,Gilmour sprayer parts??????????,"I have a Gilmour XP20 sprayer --has been great for about 2 years ocassionaly use. Now the main seal leaks and I can't tighten down the cover any more. BUT why do they make parts so hard to find???? Google comes up with lots of sites, but none specfically say parts are for the SP20!!!!!!!!!"
1,I got a lemon,I bought this because of the good reviews but was totally disappointed with the one I received. After much frustration I got it to work by reversing the seal in the cap. It now holds pressure but is still a poor sprayer compared to others I have owned.
1,Don't buy!,"Extremely disappointed with this product. When it arrived my first thought was it was a solidly built product. I tested it with water and it worked fine. Two days later I prepared it for use, filled it with the product I was going to spray, pumped, pumped, pumped, then pumped some more, no pressure build up. Followed trouble shooter instructions with absolutely no success. Pressure would not build up at all. This has to be a record for tank sprayer failure. One pint of water and it does not work anymore. Junk."
4,"Good Sprayer, Poor Manual, Great Service","Tired of cheap sprayers,I ordered the XP-30. Glad I did. It works very well. No problems with getting a seal. Pumps up quickly and holds pressure so much longer than my old sprayers. Spray pattern excellent. Primarily used to spray for weeds in lawn. Manual is poorly written but sprayer is easy to figure out. Bought this model because it has a strap. Strap helps, but is narrow for the weight of three gallons. Like wide mouth.Sprayer arrived with a broken part. The wand end opposite the nozzle was crimped and a plastic retaining piece had cracked. The wand could not be attached. The manual had an insert saying to call Gilmour's 800 number and not return a defective unit to the store. Holding my breath, I called the number. They quickly got me to a service person who knew her product and promptly shipped the replacement part. No hassle, little time lost. I was impressed."
5,You get what you pay for,"In the world of sprayers, cheap seems to be the common thread...cheap in price and cheap in quality. The Gilmour Premium Sprayer is about 3 times the usual price, but it is worth the extra expense. The feel of the materials used in the sprayer's construction is better than the usual filmsy plastic models. The sprayer has a comfortable handle. The 3 gallon capacity, while not enough to break your back, means fewer trips to prepare solution. The extra long hose and brass wand/valve illustrate the higher quality features on this model. I have had no leaks from the cap. I think this sprayer will last a long time, and I'm glad to have made the purchase."
5,Fabulous!,This product delivers everything it advertises. Easy to use and rugged construction. I will get many years use from this one.
4,Best sprayer one can buy,Best pump sprayer I have ever had. The large mouth makes filling easy. I have had mine over a year and it still has the original O rings. Thus the pump still works. This is the fist pump spryer that I have owned that has work for so long. I gave it four stars because the side handle does not support you using it to carry a full sprayer - it pulls out of the side of the tank.
1,Garbage,How about a reading of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in some obscure ancient language and externalizing the story into reality. Poetry is not fact! Angels=Aliens? Give me a break.
2,GENESIS REVISITED,"VERY INDEPTH ON ANCIENT PEOPLES, BUT A LITTLE IN LEFT FIELD ON THE FINAL OUTCOME OF HIS CONCLUSION. A GOOD BOOK TO READ AND ITS FASCINATING TO THINK ABOUT."
1,Indeed it does make you wonder.,"Indeed it does make you wonder. It makes you wonder how, in 1999, people can waste their money on this trash that insults the intelligence."
5,90 % good book,90% of this book is good info the bibical genesis info is wrong and man being genetically altered from a already pre-existing evolved cromagnan man is far fecthed..sitchin is on to alot of right things. worth the read!!!!!!! make your own conclusions for how things began. another angle piece to the puzzle of life..
2,Genesis Revisited,"Another great book by Zachariah Sitchen, I have read all eight books of his Earth chronicles and they are all very mind boggling."
4,It makes you wonder,"I have to admit at first i was sceptic, but i like to think about myself as an open minded individual so i read it. I couldn't put the book down. Granted some of Mr. Sitchin's ideas are to say the least, provocative, but what if he's right? If you are religious individual it will make you reread the bible time and time again searching for the things he talks about, and if your are not it will make you pick up a the bible and do the same thing. In any case it was and still is a good book, as are all the Earth Chronicle books."
4,Provocative,"The author makes some compelling links between current scientific discoveries and his interpretations of the ancient Sumerian texts. He deftly demonstrates that the writers of those texts had knowledge far more advanced than present-day archeaologists and paleoanthropogists would lead us to believe. Al in all, a very interesting work. The last chapter is highly speculative, but still makes the reader think. A recommended read for all students of 'how did we get here?"
4,Interesting and stimulating,A very thought provoking book. I enjoyed the research and the discovery but was a bit confused by his use of scripture.Howard Cameron author of:The Eternal Purpose of God: The Why of Who You Are
5,A GREAT BOOK FOR ANY BLUES LOVER!,"This book is about the life of Blues Legend, Henry Townsend. It gives a vibrant touch to his life before his around the world music playing days and during. Henry and Bill show us how it feels to be a Blues Legend and how to learn how to go at a career as a bluesman, Henry and Bill has wrote a masterpiece in itself. And I and hopefully others hope that this masterpiece will be followed with another. You can Find his cds on this amazon.com and others. ""The 88' Blues"" can be found in St.Louis and blueberry hill.com"
4,okay and great!,"I liked the book thick and thin, from front to back! I am glad to sell this book and review it! Henry is a genius and I guess Bill too!scott elfwood ""CHICAGO SUN-TIMES"" TM"
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"I have been an avid Brubeck fan and Brubeck collector since the 50s. I have 30 to 40 LPs and 10 to 15 CD. I've seen the old group in person several times. Jazz Impressions of Eurasia is a classic. If you are a Brubeck fan and you don't have this one ... get it. I have been listening to my LP recording now for almost 50 years and I never tire of it. I also play Jazz drums and Morello has a solo on this album that is wild. I am tempted to say that it could be his best ever but Morello has so much great stuff, I'm sure Morello fans everywhere would be writing to me. You can't go wrong with this selection. I guarantee you will like it. No question. If you don't like it ... you don't like the Dave Brubeck quartet. That's it!"
5,Dave Brubeck,"Dave Brubeck just died, at 92. God bless you, Dave. I first owned this on vinyl.Still great after all these years."
5,One of my earliest treasures.,"Went to see The Dave Brubeck Quartet in Brighton, England in 1959. To me the star was Joe Morello and his ""Paradidle Joe?"" which has haunted me since. Great Recording especially ""Hyde Park"" which ran along side the area I was born, Notting Hill Gate."
4,Mr. Cee Reviews Mr. Cool,"I saw this movie forty-one years ago. I was ninteen at the time.I liked it then and I still like it today. Time has past, but The KING OF COOL can still add an extra star to any of his movies."
2,"Baby, Falling Rain Is More Exciting!","I enjoy watching movies set in my earlier days of the 50s and 60s. And I think Lee Remick was a most desirable woman. However, Lee's demure beauty gave way to pity for the part she was given to play - a woman who takes it laying down. Compare that to today's woman who would no way put up with the bad tempered, lazy, lying, cheating husband she had. Even his lip-syncing sucked.Not enough story, nor realism. The old cars were the highlight of the movie."
2,mcqueen needed to make a great escape from this tripe,"steve mcqueen was many things, but a country & western troubador was not one of them. this is just a messy and silly movie that, while considered hot & sexy 40 years back,is now little more than a laughable blip in its stars career."
3,"A Real Downer, Yet It Has McQueen & Remick","This movie is a little slow by today's standards, and not really much of story. It's also a sad, haunting kind of movie. What I liked was the cast, which featured two of my all-time favorite actors: Steve McQueen and Lee Remick.Remick plays an old-fashioned sweet woman that is rare to see on screen these days. It was not a glamorous role, but I don't believe she's ever looked prettier. Her unspoiled daughter in this film was a nice kid, too.If this film just wasn't so darn depressing at times, I would have kept it. I sold it, but now kind of wish I had it back. Maybe three viewings were enough. Then again, it does have McQueen (who sings!) and Remick, and those two keep drawing me back. Maybe I just keep hoping it will be better than it is; whatever, be prepared: the story is a downer."
5,This book raced!,"This book was a dream to read. I loved it from the very beginning. The father is one sexy man and you want to get to know him better. His son is absolutely lovely and the kiss, oh my lord his first kiss is sweet and was the first time an author made a kiss between gay lovers excited me the same way a kiss between heterosexual characters makes me feel. The trauma and tragedy made me zoom through this book. I loved every minute. The trip to Miami was wonderful and the ending was definitely Belmondo Style! Nice work Adam Berlin!"
5,This powerful book will leave you breathless.,"I highly recommend this thought provoking book that explores a myriad of complex issues through a simple yet gripping tale of a father and son who face life together. A fast read, rich in vivid descriptions of emotions and actions, the story is one of conflict, confusion and confrontation. Love and indifference, passion and hatred, fear and loyalty, reality and fantasy, right and wrong, revenge and retribution are woven throughout the plot in such a way that the emotions evoked remain long after the final page is read."
3,They can get better,"This CD is OK, i guess. The first track, turn the tide, isn't the greatest opener but the music picks up in the 2nd (and very hi-NRG track) ""remember me"" . Overall if you like euro and freestyle equally, this should be the CD for you. The only out-of-place tracks would be Mon-A-Q - Feel the Rhythym which is a progressive freestyle track and sounds too R&B-ish for my liking. As well the last track by Stevie B has got to be the most overplayed old-school song ever on Z103.5 which was the Toronto station playing most of these songs. I would suggest Euro-Freestyle Invasion 2 or Euro Invasion 3 if you want to try out this compilation series."
3,"Nice, could have been better though....","It's a reasonable start if you want to work with GD, ImageMagick and others, but it's too much a printed version of the manpages. With examples and some tips though. It also adresses GIMP but fails to provide indept info on scripting GIMP."
1,Save your money,"This book offers nothing but the documentation found at the CPAN website. They dont even go as far as to suggest any use (other than the obvious) for any function. So, I will give you one: When printing a string in an image, do @bounds=GD::Image->stringTTF(...) first. It will give you the string dimensions without actually graphing the string. You can then use the bounds array to see what the width and size of the string is so that you can center it. Want to know what the bounds array holds? Spend the money for the book, or go look it up at CPAN.org for free. Oh, by the way, this book does not even tell you that you can call stringTTF as a package subroutine, let alone the numerous reasons why you would want to use it as such.... Like I said - save your money."
2,Disappointing,"Although the subject matter is great, it lacks a lot when it comes to substance. It is very sad when you have to trouble shoot the example source code from a book that was written to teach you. I am only halfway through the book and the two of example scripts failed do to coding problems with the modules.The Biorhythm example fails even when you copy it from the author's web site. If you are going to write a book proof your code."
3,Germany Book,"Smaller than I expected. Actually wanted ""coffee table"" book. A little spendy for what you get, but in general, a good book."
3,Causes silver to tarnish,"I am writing to confirm Aquanut's findings.I bought this setting roll at Bed Bath & Beyond, in order to ensure I recieved a ""Made in USA"" roll. My sterling silverware is made by a highly reputable producer (Reed and Barton), and all cleaned at the same time, using Hagerty silver polish.It has been about two weeks, and the silverware stored in this roll is already noticeably tarnished. By contrast, in the same cabinet drawer, wrapped in a no-name microfiber cloth, the silver was pristine.After checking the Amazon reviews on the Hagerty zippered hollowware page, I noticed this defective cloth problem seems to be widespread, and common to both the USA and China versions.Update: Hagerty replied to a letter I wrote them earlier, and sent me a Made In USA replacement roll. I will update here in a few months with any findings since then.Update (6 months later): Silver in the new roll looks good so far. No noticeable corrosion at all! Bumping up the stars to reflect the new roll."
1,Why butcher a movie?!,"Who in the world would want to watch a movie that was originally 4:3 made into 16:9?! No movie lover would! Because to be able to make a 4:3 movie into 16:9 would mean you'd have to cut parts from the top and/or bottom of the image. This is even more stupid than making widescreen movies fit the 4:3 televisions by cutting the right and left part of the film, like they used to do."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"This book has absolutely NO VALUE to the Mustang tuner. Instead get;Ford Fuel Injection & Electronic Engine Control : All Ford/Lincoln-Mercury Cars and Light Trucks 1988 to 1993Ford Fuel Injection, has an in depth explanation of how the system works, and what you should and shouldn't do to make your car perform better. Don't waste your money on this book!!!"
3,Why did they change the design,I am in the trades and have owned the 1/2 inch magnum drills for years without to many problems except the notorious switch problem milwaukee has. The drills have lasted for years and have always had plenty of power and durability. I purchased a replacement drill with the new handle configuration and it just didn't hold up.The drill is now dangerous to use without a handle and it is such a hassle to get a replacement.I'm looking for a new brand.
4,Ouch !!,The arm on the side of this drill is the weakest link.Other then that this drill is Scary strong. Don't let the size fool you.
4,Torque and power in a small package,"Don't let the statements about power and torque mislead you. This drill is not particularly big. The accessory handle makes it larger on the y axis, but the over all drill is not that big.The power is great, and I don't know how people use cordless drills for serious work.One nit-picky complaint. The chuck needs to be tight; and I mean tight. I was using a 4 1/4 hole saw for nice and neat holes in the ceiling drywall for remodeling the kitchen and dining lighting. The hole saw bit slipped out after the 3rd hole. It's drywall, come on....Turns out that what I thought was secure needed more torque from the Allan key/Jacobs chuck than I realized.My father always lends me his old Milwaukee tools from the 80's when I ask. They still work great, and its why I purchased my own."
3,Cardboard Box,Nice drill ! Good quality ! Only bad thing is that it comes in a cardboard box. Don't like that at all.
1,Why do they call it Milwaukee?,It should be labeled Beijing or something after the craphole in china where it is made. I took one look at it and sent it back. It's absolute junk - mostly plastic. It's really poorly balanced because the handle part is cheesy light plastic. The forward/reverse switch is a plastic lever the size of a matchstick. It just doesn't have the feel of a quality tool - for a hundred bucks I expected something with at least a hint of quality in the design and workmanship. Maybe you younger people don't know that at one time tools like this were made to last. This piece of junk is disposable. I guess that's why there aren't screws to change the brushes - it will never last that long. Milwaukee - shame on you! How many people have you put out of work to make this junk in china?
2,"so, so","It wasn't what I was expecting. A little too frilly for my taste and not very soft at all.I would have wanted to know more details about the fabric and the product before I purchased it. Also, I am a tall woman and have a long torso so the Teddy doesn't really fit me like it probably should.It's not very comfortable to wear."
2,seeing islam where it is not,It is really amazing how this author managed to find Islam and islamic architecture in the early 14th century Constantinople when it was ruled by Byzantium imperial family! History is not a tabularasa and even fiction needs to have its boundaries in order to be credible...
2,Not so good,I loved how the cover looked.. its beautifull and plus the title itself was interesting. But the book itself was not as good. Well it was pretty much disappointing. I loved the beginning of the book. It made me very curious to see whats going to happen next. Then the book started to get boring and boring. But I was truelly interested to read about the Sienese painter Simone Martini. But thats it. Oh and his love life with Aisha was not to exciting ethir. I was expecting more.
2,"Oh, so disappointing","Great cover. Great title. Great description: ""a dazzling novel of travel, romance and the perfect blue."" However, a boring book. It had everything going for it but it just fell flat. The beginning, with Paolo discovered abandoned in the canals of Venice, was good. But, this is all that's good. The romance between Paolo and Aisha is long, drawn out and ho-hum. Just like another reviewer I wanted to like this book. I just didn't."
5,Outstand and True,I like this song very much because so much of it is true. It wii brighten your day and make you stop and think that life isn't so bad after all.
4,You would think that this would be in a Tyrone Power DVD box set by now!,"Yes, it's marketed as a Sonja Henie picture but, in truth, the real marketing angle would be to sell it with other Tyrone Power films that have yet to make it to DVD - there's the audience! Fox has released 2 Tyrone Power box sets in recent years yet there are still many of his films that are not even on VHS, let alone DVD (I'm thinking of Suez, American Guerilla in the Phillipines and the non-Fox film Mississippi Gambler). A box set with this film and the other Sonja Henie vehicle, Second Fiddle, would be great. We Tyrone Power fans would snap them up."
4,Have with some red wine,"I have been to Napa and fell in love with it, so I was intrigued when I found this album. It is instrumental and the perfect background music for cooking, a dinner party, anything with which you can have a glass of wine. Just listening to it evokes visions of soft sunshine, mild temperatures and delicious food. It lives up perfectly to it's title."
3,German infantry with winter gear.,Note---this is a kit in which you put them together. A bit too advanced for my 8 year old. Pieces are very small that need to be glued. Would probably be better for older kids/adults. We were really looking forward because this was the only set that we could find with winter wear.
3,Not Terrible,"I didn't expect a fantastic lamp at the price I paid, so I rate it ""not terrible."" It's shinier than it looks in the picture, but that may just be my computer. The lampshade doesn't come down quite far enough to suit me, with too much of the socket showing. Also, in spite of what looked like adequate packaging, it was slightly bent. Not bad enough to send back, but certainly far from perfect. It's difficult for me to go out to shop and I needed to replace a lamp that had broken. So, it's satisfactory, but definitely not worth more than 3 stars. It looks better in the picture than in person."
2,Short Shades,"Bought a set as they looked simple and a good size. Looks true to the picture, but the shades can become an issue. These are ""uno"" style and do not fit properly!! These do not screw into the base, but slide on. As I put the shades on I saw they could not go further to the down to the edge of the socket. This leaves a horrible gap of 1/4 inch !! You can see the socket and this looks very out of shape--like a long, long black neck with the notch sticking out. I did purchase them through Target and sorry I did. I would have stood a better chance returning to Amazon, if the shipping price were right. It was suggested to buy clip on shades- for this size it's hard to find. When I did, it cost more than the lamps !! The bases are ok, but it sure messed up the look of a room."
3,Very nice looking lamp!,I ordered this lamp for myself. I like the lamp fine and feel it is quality for the price! Service was good!

2,Missing part,The lid seems just fine although not really usable. It was missing the handle (and screw to hold it on.) Although I sent a note to Amazon - never heard anything and eventually gave the lid to local Thrift Store. First bad experience on Amazon - would have at least appreciated a response to my question.
3,wok cover,this is satisfactory for my needs for a lid for my wok.I am not sure about the dimensions or the shape.
1,Flimsy lid; lousy packing,"This lid arrived today with the rim seriously folded in due to the fact that the box had zero packing material, along with rough handling somewhere along the line. The material is one step up from heavy aluminum foil in thickness. I would send it back even if it was not damaged."
1,"Only 13""","I have two 14"" wok / frypans. I wanted a lid that would cover the whole pan.I purchased this lid based on it being a ""Lid for 14"" wok"". Imagine my surprise when I received it and it was only 13"" in diameter! When placed into my wok, it drops significantly below the rim. I am very disappointed."
3,Love to Recreate our Chinese Favorites with this Wok,This wok came with useful wooden tools and free recipes in the box. After seasoning this wok we tried the Orange Chicken recipe. It wasn't anything like the Orange Chicken you get at restaurants. It was light and made with fresh flavors that were really delicious and healthy. This wok made cooking extremely fast. You have to have everything ready to use right when you start you meal or it will burn. Easy to clean and use this is a solid purchase. Great for deep frying too!
3,14 inch Wok Lid,"The key might be to buy the Wok and Dome at the same time. I bought from 2 sources and the fit is not perfect, but still works just fine!"
3,lid warps too thin a construction,"Lid for 14"" Wok (dome lid 18 gauge) Made in USAFor some reason the 14"" isn't really 14 inch. But the problem is the thinness of the lid. It's not even acceptable thinness .. never known a lid to be made so thinly that it caves in at pressure point if you even lightly press your finger on it. I have the toughest time storing it. It won't hang unless you keep it in a closed closet because the slightest breeze sets it flying, so to speak. I would definitely like to see this made heftier."
5,This is not just another mindless shooter game.,"There are more things to do in UT2K4 than you can shake a stick at. With vehicles you can drive, fly and wreck, more weapons, new characters and game objectives, one almost needs a photographic memory to keep in mind all the tasks required to complete the different kinds of missions available. I am looking forward to this game like football fans look forward to the Superbowl. This game is the pinnacle of the First Person Shooter. Get ready."
5,"Move over, MOH","Okay, I can't go in great depth about this game: I only have the demo. However, even the demo is mind blowing. This is my first Unreal, and I'm truly impressed.Gameplay: Great. Never been on single player, but multiplayer is really fun! You can customize everything, and the game is really friendly to noobs like me. Weapons? Incredible. They are very detailed, even with my bad monitor. Can't wait to try it with a new vid card.BUY THIS GAME!!! It is the best. No doubt."
4,!!!!!!!!ALL READ!!!!!!!!,"I recieved a demo of UT2004, and i was pretty impressed. There were just a couple of problems (from my point of view). One, enemies are always jumpn around, making targeting very difficult. Your reticle is also very small, and the audio of your gunshots is not that good. Second, there is hardly no teamate work at all, and the maps often seem to big. Well, god gave UT2004 vehicals, so you can always use those to get around, if u dont mind the hard and confusing controls. I did like the fact that YOU CAN TURN ON AND OFF BLOOD AND GORE, AS WELL AS ""ADULT LANGUAGES,"" for those ""teen only"" gamers. So, UT IS PRETTY GOOD, AND WELL-WORTH YOUR $$$$$!!"
5,Is this UT2K4 the CD or DVD Version???,"If you look closely (click on the thumbnail) at the front boxshot that Amazon shows, it is printed | PC DVD-ROM Software | on the bottom left hand corner. What??? I do not get what is going on, I thought this version does not support DVD-ROM and is the regular CD version. On the other hand, if you visit www.newegg.com and look at the UT2K4 box shot thumbnail pic, it is printed | PC CD-ROM Software|. Could this be a box mis-print/mix up? Can someone please help verify to clear up this confusion? Thanks.P.S. This is a great game!"
3,"Excited, but skeptical","Ive been playing these fps's for a long time, say the better part of 7 years since the first quake, and with each new installment, I weep at the sight of over-the-top new additions. Such is my fear for Unreal 2004. I am absolutely petrified at the thought of vehicles being introduced to this game. Of course it will be an interesting thing to bring into the CPL to see how fatal1ty and everyone will use them, but I, long ago, fell in love with the purity of the quake/doom/unreal/halflife franchises. Im scared that because before you had so many things to do with so little, but with vehicles it may be that you have nothing to do with too much. Im just looking forward to a bunch of great pure mayhem that stays true to what's been best."
2,Nothing New Here,Game is exactly the same. Nothing new. Graphics moderately better but its really the same old thing. It really is intended simply to move you online to open play.
4,Almost perfect BUT Credit System SUCKS,This is an ALMOST perfect game but the need to earn credits???? just to play in the ladder tournaments is simply a waste of time and ANNOYING!!! Everything else about this game is really cool but this credit thing is a MAJOR nuisance.
1,Toatly Awesome !!!!,"This game will change your life. It is the best game that i have ever seen. Where should i start ? How about all the big manly guns that make such cool sounds and effects when you shoot them. Or how about all the cool vehicles that you can drive around, that is such a cool feature. Really this game can be summerized as UT2003+1942=Toatly-Awesome-Game. In fact this game is so cool that I dropped out of college so i could play it all day. My mom is threatening to kick me out of her house and cancel our internet service, but I know she's bluffing. See you guys on a server soon ! J"
2,better than a sleeping pill,"After reading 'Masquerade"" and loving every page I had hoped the same for ""Tangled Vines"". Was I ever disappointed! This was one BORING book! If anyone has trouble sleeping, I suggest you give this a try, it might be good for something...."
2,Kinda boring! Good story but too many details!,"I found this book contained too many unnecessary details, especially on the vineyards in Nappa Valley. I was reading it for entertainment; NOT to find out how to produce and bottle wine. The book did have a good ending though! Overall = there's better books out there to waste your time on this one!"
3,So-so tape,"The tape would have gotten a better rating if the adhesive had not stuct to the tape as I rolled it out, leaving very little to stick to the material I was trying to cover. Purchased three rolls and all three had this problem, some got so bad the tape didnot stick at all"
4,Perfect for Stovepipe,"Despite not being recommended for wood/coal stoves, I used this high temperature tape to seal my wood stove flue collar, and it works great. Airtight, with no shrinkage/deterioration whatsoever!"
1,Fails at around 500,"Doesn't stick well to powder coated grill. Adhesive gets mushy and doesn't hold well at lower temps i.e. 400 as I tried to use it to hold a grill door down tighter for powder coating. At 500 to 550, for burn off, it crisped up like a potatoe chip, it delaminated and all adhesive disappeared."
2,Adhesive Problems,"The topside of this product seems adequate, and I have no doubt that it resists high temperatures. However I am unable to find that out, because the adhesive on the roll I got seems to be having some problems. When I peel this tape off, some of the adhesive sticks to the roll. What does come off, doesn't have much stick to it.I simply do not feel comfortable using this product on my pellet stove venting because I feel it will just come off over time, if it even sticks at all. I don't know if I got a bad roll or if this is a common problem, but I may have to seek another brand.Normally I trust the 3M brand, but I am dissappointed by this one."
4,"Period Music, Contemporary Players","The album is a good sampling of music composed during the American Civil War. Although many of the songs are performed using nonperiod instruments & techniques, and the Ashokan Farewell is a modern composition, Songs of the Civil War does evoke a certain feeling for the period.My wife, not so interested in history as myself, picked up her guitar upon hearing Rebel Soldier for the first time and began working it out on her instrument. Whether you are interested in history or not, if you enjoy American folk music, you might enjoy this album."
5,Songs of the Civil War,"Exceptional set of artists performing Civil War Music. The music is haunting, evocative and perfectly arranged. Great purchase."
2,Bought it for one song only...,"This is not my favorite genre of music, however I was hooked on the cut ""Ashokan Farewell"" that I had heard earlier. I saw the album on Amazon & took a chance. It is probably more to the liking of folk music fans."
4,Excellent book for the 2nd step,"This is definitely an excellent book for the beginner or even ""advanced"" beginner. After reading Ousterhout this book helps to find out about various ways to use Tcl in a more practical manner. Section-1 introduces into all the basic stuff that people usually want to use Tcl for. Section-2 gives good hints on how to write more complex applications. The last chapters though are getting somewhat superficial. But that is when you already became a more sophisticated programmer and need more sophisticated books."
2,Archaic wording,"The archaic wording and archaic style of writing I found distracting. The information is there, but you must wade thru a lot of self glorification and archaic writing nonsense, to find the meat. Fortunately there is an index. I would not recommend this book to the casual reader."
4,I Love The Anointing That God Has Placed On Pastor Shirley's Life.,"Praise God!!! Praise God!!! Praise God!!! I love the anointing that God has placed on Pastor Shirley's life. I love the way that she sings ""O Holy Night"" I ordered it last week and I played that song over and over. I wish that she'd put all 3 verses in it. I know that 2nd verse was a God given verse.I just ordered her album called Christmas. I believe I'll enjoy it also. It's now September 17, 2006. I'll now have some beautiful songs for this up coming Christmas.Hallelujah!!!Elder Loretta Taylor"
4,Very Tiny Book,"The cartoons are wonderful, typical New Yorker ones. But the book is very tiny and relatively thin. I didn't expect that."
3,"not bad, could've been better","The Tenaglia mixes of this song are not to bad, but they are not his best work either. With lots of beats and blips, until the vocals come in, where it comes to a stop, Deborah sings and when she's finished, the beats come back. This continues through the whole mix. Not really club friendly, but good for a listen anyways. The dub is more club friendly. Personally, I prefer the remixed versions of her older songs (""Rapture"", ""Atomic"" and ""Call Me"" come to mind)..."
5,I would recommend,My son loves these books! They make him laugh. I have purchased all of the Ready Freddy Books published so far and will continue to do so. He is 8 years old and they seem like the reading level is made for children his age.
4,shirt,"Nice and cheap-ish, felt good next to body, was warm. What else can I say? Not the best bargain I've ever found, but for the price feels like good quality."
2,Can't beat the price. Can find a better value though.,"Only time will tell how long they last. But I've had shirts from expensive mail order houses that wore through the elbow in less than a year, and from cheap no-names that lasted ten years. These look nice both with jeans and with a sport jacket.* * *Follow-up less than two months later: After only a few wearings and washings, two of these have started to come apart at the seams. This shirt is way too light and flimsy. I would not buy these again. Dropped my rating from four stars to two. Hopefully my two remaining shirts will last longer.I will stick to the Hanes, which seem to be better quality."
3,"Good Shirts, shrank though...","I am happy with the shirts, although after I washed them they did shrink in the sleeves and the length of the shirt. They are still wearable, but now I have to pull the sleeves up so they dont look like I am wearing a shirt that is too small. Shirts are good quality, and am happy with them except the fact that they did shrink."
2,Shrinkage,"Purchased this shirt at a Walmart for $3.00 on closeout.. I wear 2x long sleeve t's. Purchased a 3x ,it was huge until laundering once(cold water). It is now a large at best.It's now short, wide and the sleeves are short..If it shrinks anymore it will be to small for me.So buy big,way big.Of course you will then get a very large waist also."
2,Looked too baggy,"This shirt looked so wide at the waist, but the arms were normal. This made the shirt look like a gown or dress. Not worth it."
5,Soft but...,"Material is nice and soft, but they are cut for a strange build.Wide at the shoulder, narrow at the hip, but with looong, skinny armsand a thick neck. A shame really, because the material is fairlythick and soft, and the body is generously long."
4,It is what it claims to be,"The quality is fine. It's thin enough to wear under other shirts, but thick enough to wear it as a shirt itself."
3,Bought it for a Luigi costume,"It isn't the most comfortable or well made shirt I have ever worn, but there was nothing wrong with it. I wore it for a Halloween costume for a few hours and it performed admirably."
4,I like these shirts,These shirts are well made & the fabric is heavy enough for cool weather. The size cut is good too
5,Audigy: The new face of sound,"The Sound Blaster Audigy Gamer is one of the best in the series. its low price tag and high performance is an attraction for any in-depth gamer or just advanced computer enthusiast. Its outputs allow for maximum output, and when paired with the Creative Inspire 5.1 speaker surround system, it makes your computer a virtual movie theater for DVDs. And just a note, contrary to previous reviews, for a relativiely low price ($ 30 or $ 40 I think), you can get a daughter card that connects easily to any Audigy or Live card that includes 2 SPDIF Input and 2 SPDIF Output, as well as an Adapter for TOSLink (Great for digitally recording music to your MiniDisc). EAX support and Audigy's amazing 3D sound performance should bring light to the darkness of your computer's monotonous tones. Its worth the price!!"
1,If only it....worked,"If you're running WinXP make sure you do a search on Audigy and ""squeal of death"" before handing over your money. If I'm lucky, I can actually get a full minute of music from this card before the PC locks up. I've tried all the recommendations but one thing persists: an obnoxious squeal. There's plenty of finger pointing (chip set, BIOS, PCI slot, drivers) but to date, no fix. With WinME, smooth sailing and nice sounding."
2,"nice card, horrible hassle","Great sound, but making it work with windows xp is impossible unless you have a masters in computer science. customer service from creative is AWFUL. i mean AWFUL. if you have a problem, (and with windows xp you will) you're going to have to fix it yourself. the combination of audigy and windows xp is NOT for the faint of heart or the unsavvy of consumers. other than that, no complaints."
2,Lack of features,"A major flaw is the lack of SPDIF digital in and out, as available on the Philips soundcard."
5,Sound card for your GAME/MUSIC/DVD MOVIE!!!!!,"The Creative Labs Augigy Gamer Sound Card is one of the best sound cards up to date. With the support of 5.1 dolby digital technology, combined with your DVD player, it can create amazing surround sound. This sound card also supports up to 6 speakers (so get the Logitech 640!!!) and combine it with this excellent card. Not only can it be used for movies/music, playing PC games are a delight. From Counter Strike to Unreal Tournament, this card can prove to you that the enemy cannot hide. You'll hear footsteps from your rear speaker and front side speaker. If you are looking for a sound card with amazing capabilities at a low price, get this sound card, you won't regret it!!!"
2,RedHat Linux 6 server,"Poorly written..,IDG does a very poor job of quality control. Typo's are apparent through out this book. The direction of the author is unclear he rambles into examples without indicating what file he would like you to edit! The WEB server chapter is very poorly written. I have not found anything in this chapter that may help the beginner in displaying web pages. Mohammed J. Kabir assumes that you have compiled html pages already! My real problem with this book is that Mohammed J. Kabir uses RedHat Linux 5.2 references and commands, although Linux commands are virtually the same but the idea of not being current is ridiculous. Mohammed J. Kabir use RedHat Linux 5.2 when writting a book about RedHat Linux 6 server! I can't believe the editors at IDG or it's parent division let this book go out like this! A don't buy book for sure!"
4,Good scope of topics,"After scanning a few pages, I know that is what I am looking for. The author makes a good choice of those topics related to server. Very practical and helpful. Suitable for those people having some degree of UNIX/Linux knowledge. The slightly inaccurate command-line options sometimes drive you to the 'man' pages."
5,"Bravo, two thumbs up","A few months ago it was next to impossible to find a useful book on Linux. It seems that things are changing for the better. I read from this book for 5 hours, before I bought it. The reason for this screening was, that I didn't want to buy another lemmon (and yes, there are too many out there). I am happy to have this book in my shelf and I would like to thank the author for another step I was able to climb because of his work. Thank you. A true 5 star book."
3,Incompatible with Red Hat Linux 6.1 (Professional),"I bought the Official Red Hat Linux 6.1 Professional from the Red Hat web site. I have had problems throughout this book in using it with that software. For starters, this book doesn't cover the new GUI installation options. Further, every time I try something new (e.g. Apache installation) I find that files are not where this text says they should be. Some problems are simple to overcome, but some are not.Having said that, the book isn't bad in its coverage of some of the general things one might want to do with a Linux server. It's readable and has some nice examples.Perhaps if you use the Linux off the (included) CD, Red Hat 6.0, you won't have these problems (but who wants to install yesterday's Linux?). If you want to use this text with the latest Red Hat, caveat emptor."
5,Very easy to follow,"I have yet to read this book cover to cover, while refering to this book for a How to on configuring a DNS server in Linux I was amazed at the 'to the point' this author has described the task. I am now more intruiged about Linux and can't wait to read more and have a better understanding of Linux Red hat. I think this is a must buy for anyone planning to use Linux Red hat as a server and is new to Linux."
4,Very Good,"This book is an excellent reference for the Linux/GNU Red Hat Release user. The book covers just about any topic the beginning user requires to configure his or her system. The examples give you almost everything you need but don't quit give all the details required to complete the task. However, having said that, this book supplies the background required to complete the task at hand. Matt Welsh's ""Running Linux"" is the industry classic. This book runs a close second in my opinion."
5,The Future of Zydeco has arrived!,"""Bringing the Heat"" is doing just that! Nooney has very smoothly evolved traditional Zydeco on this CD without creeping over into the dreaded New Age Zydeco, which bears no resemblance to what I suspect that Clifton Chenier intended when he brought Zydeco music to the forefront. Within this CD are a lot of high energy, fabulous, original tunes that keep me dancing in my mind, body and spirit! I plan to add more Nooney CD's to my collection very soon."
3,run small,"Not true to size. Run small. If you have curves, don't buy. Other than that good quality material. Good color"
1,Avoid This Book,"This book reminds me of everything I hated about law school at Yale--the philosophy, the pretension, the utter lack of interest in the real world.The author writes a book about trials--and yet discusses almost no trials at all. Apparently Burns is a failed philosophy professor, because he has infintely more interest in his own mind than in what goes on in the courtroom. It is books like these that astound me--how can anyone think this is good enough to publish?The prose is clunky, and Burns finds endless ways to make trials utterly dull. His ideas reduce to no more than the generalities one learns in Trial Practice classes--tell a strong story; every element of your case should reflect the theme; juries are unpredictable.This book is awful. But then, Burns is probably a poseur--no trial lawyer can be as dull as Burns is and still survive. If one really wants to study the essence of trials, try reading Vincent Bugliosi."
3,Dr. Phillip Gray Bremen Georgia,"Dr. Daniel B. Wallace has produced an excellent Greek grammar that has been found useful as the textbook for Intermediate Greek Readings courses at Southern Christian University. One would wish that his discussions of such passages as Mark 16:16 and Acts 2:38 had been a little less polemical. (He reverts, at times, to giving explanations consonant with the unique dogma of his own fellowship instead of strictly from the standpoint of Greek grammar.) But, all in all, this is a helpful volume. For an in-depth scholarly review, see [...]"
5,"Greek Grammar, Beyond the Basics by Daniel B. Wallace","I'm just finishing First Year Greek and find William Mounce's BasicsBasics of Biblical Greek Grammara real leap forward to the older beginning grammars. He gives adequate beginning definitions in that volume but gives regular references to the expanded treatments in Wallace's Intermediate GrammarGreek Grammar Beyond the Basics. Listed in a similar stye and expanding on Mounce's beginning treatments, it is the perfect segway into Intermediate or Second Year Greek. It also doubles as that USABLE reference that you will actually use on a regular basis as you are seeking to translate or resolve curiosities in the NT Greek text. Wallace really has forgotten more about Greek than most ever learn and we're all really glad he wrote it down! Great value, many improvements over older Grammars and lots of new research that ultimately makes the language easier to learn. Great service from Amazon and, again, I feel like I got great value."
2,Not as expected,"I did not care for this book. For example, he says on pp. 170-171 ""...in Eph 5:18 as ""be filled with the Spirit"" in the sense that the Spirit is the content with which one is filled is most likely incorrect."" Then later in the book on pp.215 he says it is. Much of the author's theological interpretation is used to explain scripture and I didn't agree with much of it. I highly recommend David Black's ""It's Still Greek to Me"" intermediate Greek over this."
5,Great Book,"This was my first grammar that I got, not knowing it was for second year students and beyond. I had learned something about Greek and the biblical text and all that because of my interest in apologetics and cults. This book helped me on some of the texts that cults like to use and abuse for their own purpose. Now being in seminary, and planning to study Greek in the future, it will be something I will need. It also directed me to William Mounce's work which was great.God Bless Dr. Wallace."
5,greek grammar beyond the basics,I didn't order this for myself but for a student of my huband's for his birthday. He is thrilled with the book -- has wanted it for a long time. He is highly interested in languages and wants to pursue seminary education. This will be great for him. Thank you.
5,"Greek Grammar, Beyond the Basics",This textbook is an extremely comprehensive treatment of the Greek grammar beyond the basics. A basic knowledge of Biblical Greek is required to get the most out this text book. It is highly recommended for all who are studying Biblical Greek and desire to get beyond the grammatical categories to see the revelance of syntax for exegesis.
4,My cats love it!,I purchased this for my Rag Doll cat (Now 12 years old). When I first put the catnip pouch inside of it and threw it over to him he went crazy. He was batting it all over and pouncing on it. He still plays with it now but he also likes to lick it and lay on it. Its like the other reviewer said its almost like he is treating it like his kitten. I have already purchased a second one (the squirrel).
2,"""Cod Liver Oil"" is a misleading name for this product","Cod liver oil is a great food supplement because it gives you fine, natural fatty acids and vitamin A and D. One tablespoon per day is a perfect dose. However, with the stated quantities of vitamin A and D in a capsule, this product couldn't possibly be straight, unadulterated cod liver oil. It must be fortified or concentrated to contain 1250 IU of vitamin A and 135 IU of vitamin D in a minuscule softgel. The correct label would probably be something like ""Vitamin A and D Supplement Based on Cod Liver Oil"", so don't buy this product if you want cod liver oil for a balanced supplement of omega-3 and vitamins."
4,Picardia Mexicana(1978),"In Picardia Mexicana(1978), a macho guy(Vicente Fernandez) and a lovely schoolteacher(Jaqueline Andere) raise a boy when his mother is forced to do time in prison! This film is part comedy, part tearjerker drama. It has a fair amount of profanity and vulgar humor(For example, Adalberto Martinez and Hector Suarez run nude down a street!); one should be careful when watching PM around kids or prudes.In the film Me Quiero Casar(1967), Angelica Maria can be seen reading a copy of Armando Jimenez's book Picardia Mexicana. The credits to this film claim that the movie is an adaptation of Jimenez's book. Also, this film is a nice time capsule. In the background, a kid can be seen wearing a Jaws T-shirt. Jaqueline Andere looks great in this film...even in tacky 1970's clothes! PM ""echos"" Mexican movies of the past(Nosotros Los Pobres, El Bolero de Raquel, etc.). PM is required viewing for anyone curious about Mexican cinema."
1,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING - WRONG PRODUCT SENT,"-Olay INTENSIVE RESTORATION TREATMENT in a black tube was advertised.-I ordered 3 of that item-HBA ZONE INC sent 3 items of Olay TARGETED WRINKLE REPAIR-HBA ZONE INC advertised one product, but sent another-Very deceptive advertising and sending a wrong product that was not ordered.-RATING OF PRODUCT: EXCELLENT.-Rating of VENDOR is POOR. Do not order from this Vendor."
2,No Results,I have been using this product for almost a year now and have had no results with this. It has not harmed me in any way but my skin would have been the same without this product. A waste of money.
2,not a product for everyone,"As soon as I started using this product, I noticed that lots of red dots showed up at my upper chest. I stopped it right away, and those red dots disappeared a day later. This product might does the wonder, but it's certainly not for everyone who might be allergic to it."
5,Just what I needed!,"I am so pleased with these spice racks. They are clear and wide enough to hold a lot of spices. And because they come individually, I was able to place them so that they didn't hit the shelves in my cabinet when I closed the door. (Unlike those that have two or three shelves attached together.) I was able to fit two racks between each shelf in my cabinet (one for tall spices and one for the short containers). I have alphabetized my spices and now I can instantly find the spice I want. It is true that they don't include screws for mounting. Be sure not to get screws that are too long for your particular cabinet door. It really helps to drill a small pilot hole before putting in the screw, if you have access to a drill. I bought several of these racks at Container Store, but they stopped carrying them, and I was glad to find the same ones here at Amazon."
3,It could've been better!,"This movie could've been better for the simple fact that all it had was fighting and some silly story about somebody stealing some money! All throughout the movie there were too many costume changes, sucky effects,and mediocre fighting! Just because Alexander Lou was in this movie it didn't make it any better. Now don't get me wrong there is alot of fighting but it could've been better. The one good thing about this movie is the fact that there's no trace of a love story and for that reason alone its just best to rent this movie before you buy it!"
2,Too dry...,I had a hard time getting into this movie. I'm guessing it was bc of the transfer which was horrible. I've tried to watch this movie now for 3 days but it is hard to follow.
2,not what it seems,this toy is not as good as it seems - you cannot see the pinball in the daylight - it is ok to play at night in the dark but that is all
4,A good adjunct for more clinical correlations,"Sometimes one finds the fractal nature of detail in gross anatomy hard to grapple with. There is in fact a good deal of wheat that can be dismissed for chaff. Most good texts have clinical corrleations, however, these are not the emphasis of those books. This small book makes for good reading to test oneself on the logical implications of anatomy in a clincal setting. (Lachman constantly asks the reader questions) I found it both refreshing for its readibility (unusual for anatomy related texts) and its engaging style. A recommended read for any student of the medical arts."
4,Interesting juxtapositions,"Coming from a Lebanese-American family and living in Washington, I was interested in what Alemeddine was putting together in this book. Although it took me some time to touch each narrative to its central character -- there're quite a few central characters here -- I found the treatment of their separate but eerily similar situations sensitive and sensual. This is definitely worth reading, and I would hope that more English-speaking Lebanese and Lebanese-American writers come forth with valuable works."
5,A Wonderful Find,"I think this is a kind of a masterpiece. It's one of the most extraordinary books I have read in a long time. The writing is crisp, the concept is fresh, and in spite of the seriousness of the subject matter, this book is drop dead funny. I really loved this book. It's the real thing."
3,Classic Standards By The Ellington Band,"This CD represents a excellent take of the Ellington Band's most notable pieces. A serious collector will find no need for this, 1960 live concert. But for the average and casual fan, this CD will provide a excellent introduction to the Ellington Band and its famous members."
1,Don't buy until you read this!,"I purchased this unit shortly before last Christmas. Initially the unit worked fine and the sound was acceptable. Within a month the unit would play the i-pod but there would be no sound coming out of the speakers. When I visited the Klipsch website to see about warranty information I saw numerous complaints about the same problem. Apparently there is an undisclosed defect with this model.(Just check to see how many refurbished units they have for sale on the web) I still have not heard back from Klipsch regarding fixing or replacing the unit.Since I have little or no hope of hearing back from Klipsch, I have purchased the Bose unit and want to tell you that it blows the Klipsch unit away in the sound department. Bose knows what they are doing when it comes producing big sounds from small spaces.Hope this helps."
1,Defective Product Look Elsewhere,"I recieved this product as a gift in 2007. After one year of playing it, the product made loud popping sound and lost its volume. The unit will no longer produce any sound. I called Klipsch for technical support. They said since the unit was out of warranty there was nothing they could do. They would not offer to repair or look at my broken Igroove. To put it mildly, they were absolutely no help what so ever. They're answer was ""Go buy a new one they're cheaper now"".Just about like everything else, Klipsch makes their ipod products in China, and they are mass produced. I would say Klipsch new business model is to make cheap crappy products and rely on their laurels of their quality name to dupe the consumer into buying junk."
5,Klipsch Quality and low price,"I purchased this Ipod speaker dock for my office. It meets all expectations and could easily fill a much larger area with big accurate sound. For the price of a cheap unit, I received a real speaker system from a real speaker company. The quality is evident and I would highly reccomend it for what it is."
1,"Terrible Sound, Garbled and Disappointing","I design consumer audio professionally. I bought the iGroove for premium sound in my bedroom, to listen to while my girl and I are getting it on. This system sounds terrible with my iPod. I tried a variety of different music. The differen levels are all garbled, there's no crispness at all, no distinction. The bass is fuzzy even at medium volume levels, forget about high volume, it sounds awful. The remote is oversized and shaped oddly, it's curved and doesn't sit flat. I am going try and return it. Really not a high end stereo at all. I'm going to try something else."
4,"Got one, now I am buying another","This is a great unit, that maintains audio clarity to the highest levels of volume. I bought this for my girlfriends birthday and neither of us have been disappointed. Recently, I used it as the sole source of music for a housewarming party in a room of approximately $600 sq feet, with 14 foot ceilings and it worked very well.A word to the wise, if you are looking for a portable unit do pick this one. Carrying this thing around is not recommended, this is a home unit and is bulky or more accurately oddly shaped for travel purposes."
4,Great sound,"This system has a great sound. I've been quite pleased with it overall. My only complaint is that when you first turn it on it is always at maximum volume. That could be a little dangerous, depending on what song your iPod is on at that moment."
4,Great bang for the buck,"Love my iGroove almost as much as iPod. I only wish that I could control the iPod with the iGroove remote. The only control options are for volume, back/forward, play/pause. It would've been nice to access the menu. Other than that, it provides nice room filling sound in a small footprint."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I'm not actually a fan of short stories at all. They typically don't let you get into the heart of a character enough to make it worthwhile. Frequently they lack any character development at all. Not so with Donoghue's stories. She pulls you in to her characters and leaves you wanting more, but not feeling denied. I was pleasantly surprised."
1,Terribly Dull,"First off, I immensely enjoyed Donoghue's historical novel Slammerkin. Room was a good novel by her, also, in my opinion. Those two books were why I elected to try some more of Donoghue's works. This book has let me down in the worst way. To be fair, I read over half of it and I was bored out of my mind the entire time. The stories have no set plots. They just simply seem to capture various themed moments in different types of individual's lives - very, very dull moments. There were maybe two stories which I enjoyed the least bit: The Cost of Things and Touchy Subjects. As I was reading each story, I was just waiting for something - anything - to happen. But nothing ever did. By the end of each story I just felt as if I might as well have not read anything at all. Huge disappointment."
5,THERE IS SOMETHING OFF THE WALL IN THE AIR,THERE IS SOMETHING OFF THE WALL IN THE AIR AND IT IS IN THIS BOOK. IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS CREEPY AND ODD. STRANGE ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE ONE TO QUESTION THE WORLD AROUND. MANY SHORT EERIE STORIES AND SOME QUITE COMICAL. ONCE READING THE FIRST PAGE OF ONE OF THEM STOPPING IS NOT AN OPTION. THE MIND CRAVES MORE AND MORE AND EVEN MORE. GETTING TO THE FINAL PAGE IS A DILEMMA. MORE MADNESS IS NEEDED WHEN ITS OVER.BLARING SIREN * AN ABSOLUTE EYE OPENER AND SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM AND PASS ON TO THE NIEVE.
5,A Very Solid Release,"I've been a fan of Matt Pond PA for years now, and this album does nothing to change that. Beautifully arranged, clear pieces drift like fog into one another and one feels as if they're levatating through this entire album. Matt Pond at it's apex."
4,I Have To Admit...,"I admit it's a great record, and I do think they should get more attention. I definately like their music, but I wouldn't give this record 5 stars. I mean, it's a really good record, but it doesn't immpress me. When compared to Death Cab, Built To Spill, The Shins etc., Matt Pond PA isn't even near as good."
4,New Author to Watch,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It was recommended to me by the author's wife, and I thought I would buy it to help the bottom line for the family. Times are tough. Midnight Rain was a fast paced read with a lot of intrigue. The protaganist was very personable - every kid next door. The ending was a little predictable, but not so much to stop me from reading it through. I liked it and will look forward to more works from this author."
2,Cute Idea: Very Disappointing Quality,"My children love tiny books, and I thought these would make a great addition to their mini library. I recognized a few of the titles and authors. The price was unexpectedly low, but this is Amazon, where low prices often surprise me!Boy, was I disappointed! I knew they were paperback, but the covers are actually the same paper as the pages. And that paper is even lighter & flimsier than most inexpensive children's books. Because of the poor paper quality, the colors in the illustrations are weak & pale. They look someone made them on a copy machine at their office using the cheapest copy paper they could find.I don't know how the product information could be revised to warn buyers that these books are designed to be disposable. Even a very careful child would be challenged to keep these books nice. I guess if I had bought them as party favors or trick-or-treat goodies, I wouldn't mind. Too bad my daughter has become attached to them, or I'd probably return them."
2,Flag print not very clear,The lions are fuzzy and this looks like a low budget flag... it was low budget too so i guess you get what you pay for.
1,Can someone tell me the benefit of owning one of these?,"I purchased this thinking I could adjust the depth of cut without accessing the router in my router table. You can't. You still have to open the router table door and unlatch the motor from the base. This is exactly the same procedure when using the built-in depth adjustment knob on the router. Also, when inserting the nut driver from above the table, it is difficult to find the nut in the router base. In conclusion, this accessory makes it more difficult to adjust the depth of cut on my 5615 Milwaukee router. It was a waste of money for me.I do have the Benchdog cast iron plate, with above table adjustment; that is what I thought this wrench was going to allow me to do."
5,So refreshing.,Murphy's Romance is one of the best romance films I've seen. Just A very sweet and refreshing film. I have watched it many times.
3,Regrets,"I had not seen this movie for many years and remembered liking it. I decided to buy it after reading the long review by the young woman who was so eloquent in writing about why she thought it was such a romantic movie. While I did enjoy watching it, the last line where Murphy tells Emma that he was 63, stopped me in my tracks. Though I think older men can be very attractive, as an older woman I also know that in real life Emma will regret a 30 yr age difference in under 5 years and she will still be young and wanting more out of life.30 years age difference is wanting a Dad not a lover and companion.This movie I passed on to Good Will."
4,Murphy's Romance,I owned the movie on VHS and had not watched it for years. Met someone new and she said it was one of her favorite movies. I ordered it on DVD and we had a surprise movie night together. The movie was just as remembered. We are both fans of James Garner and Sally Field and it is a good date night movie.
5,Excellent Movie!,"We bought this as a present for my mother-in-law, who loves this movie and mentioned in passing that she would like to own it. I couldn't find it easily at stores, so I found it here. The whole family is really excited to have it, as apparently they all really like the movie, so they can't wait for her to open it up. We genuinely enjoy watching this movie together as a family, all ages included from the children in the family to the adults. It only gets better with time! Wonderful movie!"
4,A classic,"This is a really fun movie and a classic and I personally loved it, and I highly recommend it, Sally Field and James Garner are brilliant"
4,"Well written, well acted romantic comedy.","This is a great little film! Fields and Garner are wonderful (as is the supporting cast), and the writing and acting lift this simple tale of relationsips into a movie you can watch over and over again. Some of Fields' takes are priceless (check the dance-hall scene), and Garner's explaination of the body-language of cowboy hats is a classic. I find myself quoting the script now and then (""It's a long way to drive with two babies..."")! All this and a great love story too, plus beautiful scenery and great music by Carol King. An all-time favorite."
5,Very enjoyable,I purchased this DVD for my mom. I had not seen this movie in years since it is not shown on TV very often. We forgot how truly enjoyable this movie was.
3,Waste of money,"I rented this movie from amazon & before I could get the silly crap player to work with windows 7,the thing expired!I'll never rent from amazon again!"
2,Murphy's Romance,"be careful here...if you expect a real ""letterbox"" you won't get it. this is matted, sad to say. the scenes would have been GREAT in real letterbox!"
5,Great movie. My all-time favorite.,Great movie. My all-time favorite.I've seen this movie about 30 times.Far more than any other that I've ever watched.Great family viewing.
5,Murphy's Romance Review and Music Question,"I actually went to the movies to see this folks! I enjoyed it throughly. At first I said here we go again... older man,younger woman but as I watched the movie and got into the plot, I could understand how something like that happens. I have always liked Sally Field and James Garner. It is a wonderful movie, a good love story, and well acted. One night last week, I happened to catch the end of this movie on TV and was reminded of how much I like the music. Not just the song sung by Carol King, but the instrumental part too. I will never understand why this kind of music is so hard to find. I am also having a hard time finding the instrumental piece used in Gumpy Old Men. Why is this so difficult? If anyone knows where I could get the music outside of copying it from the movie I would be so greatful."
2,For light duty only.,"Unlike what the Black & Decker Marketing department says, don't even think about using the Black & Decker 9072CTN on furniture. It is suitable only for driving small screws into pre-drilled plastic or sheet metal, or with plastic screws. The gears inside are plastic and cannot take the torque of driving a screw without a pre-drilled shank-diameter hole that is deeper than the screw. Unless the material is soft, it should not be used to tighten a screw."
2,DO NOT EXPECT TO DRILL ANYTHING WITH THIS,"I have a more powerful black and decker cordless screwdriver and was aniticpating the same with this version. It is very weak...the one I have that works very well is 6 volts. I believe this is 4, and IT MATTERS. It is okay for very very light duty things, but nothing more."
2,it's probably not what you're looking for,I bought this to assemble my Ikea furniture with and to help me make some pilot holes in my drywall. This thing broke after 1 day. It would make a great gift for a 13 yr old to start his own tool collection.
3,Great Tool But lasted only 90 Days,Works great. Battery last a very long time. But one day while screwing in a screw for my licence plate the shaft fell out of the end.I tried to return but its past the 7 days window. But at just $13 I will just order another and hope for the best.
1,Low Power,"I got this to replace my old green colored Black & Decker cordless screw driver, and boy was i disappointed. It has about 1/2 the speed and way less power than the old one did. I would put this on par with the quality and power of the original Black & Decker black cordless screw drivers. It does not even compare to the green colored models. So beware."
2,not as good as my old black & decker,"the screwdriver is good for very light jobs. i was really disappointed, it didn't have the power of my old black and decker, that i had for years before it just quit working. you better make sure you drill the holes good before you put the screw in..i wish they would return to the old design."
5,disney,Mt grandchildren love this collection. I purchased it for them. They love Disney. Everything was received in excellent condition.
1,doesn't work at all!,"all it is is salt water, thats it, if i knew that i wouldn't have bought this, even though it's cheap, dont waste ur money"
1,"Not durable, poor quality",I purchased two of these units and within 4 months they have both failed to rotate automatically as designed. They unexpectedly stop rotation and a small area gets flooded and water wasted. I cannot recommend this product based on my experience.
3,Nice Idea Poor Construction,"Great idea, great product but it is held together with steel rivets that after its first use began to rust and now after a few weeks in the outdoors are entirely rusted. One would think that if Gilmour had the sense to make the legs out of aluminum they would have had the sense (not be so cheap) to use stainless or even galvanized parts to hold it together. I had planned to buy a second unit if the first was top quality. I will not buy a second."
1,Big disappointment,"Major disappointment! This model is very poorly constructed. The screw connecting the sprayer control to the unit kept falling out. I had to keep having to screw it back on. Finally, it fell where I couldn't find it. I gave up and contacted the Gilmour people. The Gilmour service center was of very little help. Not worth the money, in my opinion."
1,999tp,"After two weeks of heavy use the head stopped reversing direction. An email to Gilmour got a promise of a replacement. The spikes on the feet are easily deformed and difficult, if not impossible, to straighten; but without them the unit tips over freely. The 106 foot diameter does not equate to 3500 square feet and is optomistic - a 40' radius is more realistic"
1,Parts fell off,"Item worked for about two hours, then began to malfunction - stopped turning. It just kept spraying in one place. I turned the water off to inspect the sprinkler head and parts fell to the ground. Don't know the name of the parts but it is what ratchets the sprinkler to spray in the other direction. Waste of time and money."
2,"Good at first, does't last","I was very pleased with this sprinkler when I bought it last year when our regular sprinkler system needed a new pump. It worked just as advertised and was not hard to set up. This year, however, almost everything stopped working and it developed leaks that were hard to fix. Sometimes it rotates - sometimes it doesn't, and the range is greatly truncated, partly because the control seems welded in place. Sometimes, there really isn't even a spray, but just a fountain - and the system pressure is fine. Perhaps, we didn't treat it right - it was left outdoors in the fall and spring - but you'd think a 65.00 sprinkler could tolerate that. Not something I'd recommend, but perhaps with more compulsive care it would last longer. Who'd have thought that one could diagnose his personality type by the state of his garden sprinkler?"
2,"Happy, then Sad","Same experience as many other reviewers. I was initially thrilled with this item, although the screw used to set the height never did work correctly...after an hour or so of use, the vibration would work the telescoping shaft all the way down and I'd have to go out and raise it again.However, after one summer of relatively moderate use (maybe 15 hours per month for about 4 months) it has gone haywire. The clips used to set rotation have inexplicably become so loose on the shaft as to be useless. Plus the thing leaks like crazy.I like the concept, but I'm not crazy about this version of it."
1,"No idea how it is, because some one else got my order","I ordered this product on 6/26/2005, and it has been ""shipping"" soon for over 3 weeks. Today I received a phone call from some one from a different city. He said that he has my package for this sprinkler, but he had never ordered it, and it has my name on it. Amazon's shipping system is getting really bad. I ordered about 30 things last month, and three of them never shipped, 2 of them were missing. Since AMazon has no phone number to call in now, and does not answer email inquiries, I am forced to give bad feedbacks on products I did not receive."
3,slightly disappointed,Worked fine first couple of times used but now does not rotate both ways. so I cannot use the field adjustment anymore.
1,LOW QUALITY,Leaks like crazy. Will not turn no matter what you do. Very low quality. May be good as a paperweight or scrap metal.
5,Strong Second Album,"Another former Chaka Khan background singer, Penny Ford's second album is a strong R&B effort! Penny's dance remake of the Aretha classic 'Daydreaming'is great, and was getting the attention it deserved when it was released, but then no more promotion! This cd has a great mix of R&B and some strong ballads...'Wherever You Are Tonight' you can really hear the Chaka influence...'I'll Be There' and the fantastic 'This Love' I love this song!... and the funky 'Nevertheless' are just some of the highlights on this CD."
4,Must-have,"Way more convenient for small jobs than the belt sander. It's 3M, it's good, the loops on the pad are tough. I think this will last quite a while. I also bought a 50-pack of 5-hole paper (assorted) here on Amazon, which works well with this disc."
4,Bed Rails,"Like the rails, the only thing that was difficult was I had to trim off some rubber on the inserts or they would not fit. Otherwise very happy."
2,well maybe not yet,"on listening to the previous record I thought they had some potential but , again, they are derivative of Gang of Four and if I had more time I could probably tell you where each of those riffs came from they are so familiar!I appreciate what they are after but go out and get ""Entertainment"" and ""Solid Gold"" by Gang of Four instead - hard to believe they are from 20 years ago! As far as newer bands of this ilk go I think the Liars are a major force!"
4,Not original but a listenable variation....,"This is by far Radio 4's best album to date--Yes, they sound like Gang of Four....Yes...it sounds like Jah Wobble playing bass....here's a new one, they even remind me a bit of Dance Society with the synth textures and the sometimes shouted lyrics. Amidst all the comparisons and blatant lifting, I must admit, after listening to Entertainment, Solid Gold, Metal Box and every other 'influence' for going on over 20+ years---I'm glad to have something a bit differant-----Franz Ferdinand sounds like Gang of Four and Au Pairs....still interesting....even the Futureheads sound like a mix of XTC and early Bill Nelson (Red Noise era). Truth is, these bands are made up of kids that have grown up listening to their parents record collections.....I would certainly rather have a band ripping off Wire and the Comsat Angels then playing grundge, metal or rap...."
1,Make a living off of unoriginality,"At what point does a tribute band become shameless rip off artists? I would say w/ this Radio 4 album. You can hear bits of Gang of Four, The Chameleons, PIL, and Joy Division throughout. The guitar interplay completely rips off The Chameleons circa ""Script of the Bridge"". Completely empty is how you feel after listening to this - and you'll find yourself reaching for your copy of ""second edition"" or ""entertainment!"". This guys voice is awful - a shame they can't ape the amazing vocals of Mark Burgess or Ian Curtis. The worlds biggest cover band is on display with this release. Save your money and save originality."
2,A fairly bland rock album,"The main problem with this C.D. is that none of the tracks are really very catchy. Except for the energetic song ""New Disco"" that finishes the album, nearly every track is relatively dull electronic rock that gets old pretty quickly. Radio 4 can also be criticized for using a sound effect that sounds strikingly like the bass for Nine Inch Nails, yet does not impress me nearly as much. Only near the end of Gotham do the real gems emerge, such as the song ""Certain Tragedy"". Although the uninteresting vocals are somewhat of a hindrance, joy can be obtained from this song's energetic guitar and addictive rhythm. The aforementioned ""New Disco"" is also a really good track for its noisy atmosphere, featuring the occasional cry of ""New Disco!"" and a series of electronic squeaks which never cease to entertain. Generally this album is fairly tolerable, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,This is the best record of this year !!!(I felt),It's amazing!This is a new generation's dance music!You should buy and listen to it!The new world will spread!
4,An innovative debut...,"and a refreshing addition to electronica. I can't recommend this album enough, particularly if you're an Underworld fan."
4,'Sugar' helps the medicine go down.,"Aalacho's CD is a refreshing change-up from what's become an electronic scene clogged with depressingly sound-alike factory beats from interchangeable DJ's. It's a fairly chilled-out affair of ambient-house pop-tunes with a few danceable/tranceable numbers thrown in to get your booty shakin'. The addition of electric and acoustic guitar to a number of the tracks (both vocal and instrumental) helps set this collection apart from other strictly synthetic discs by adding a sonic warmth and a slightly indie-rock aesthetic to the mix. The vocals are highly processed and often arranged in hypnotic chanting patterns, while catchy rhythms and shimmery guitars upend the traditional pop-song structure throughout. And then there's the decidedly unique cover version of Fleetwood Mac's ""Sara"". A solid listen, with definite cinematic overtones."
2,divider woes,"The divider is attractive from a distance, but the iron is ""rebar"" that has been attractively bent, but does not hold paint very well. The box arrived undamaged, but there were pieces missing to hold the fabric and vision decor does not respond to emails."
4,Wool Pads,Comes neatly packaged and what I needed for various projects around the house. Would buy again when the need arises.
5,Xtra Fine,"Arrived on time. The steal wool is extremely fine. I use it on hand made inlay after each layer of wiped on polyurethane. I've always sanded however this product works better then sand paper. The shine stays behind but the brush/ towel marks disappear along with the other little nits. Leaving an ultra mark free shine. It works grate if you have to take off more then one coat of lacquer to fix a small area. The seal also holds muh of what is ""sanded"" . I can sweep it up or use a magnet which also picks up the sawdust. The price doesn't compare to the paper."
4,B2K is the best,I love the B2K cd even though they had slow songs on there I like more of the club joints. But besides that I think the album is mad hot. I'm truley fellin' it.
5,The best new group out!!!!!!!!!!,"I love B2k's song, Uh Huh. It is one of the best songs out right now. They are mad talented. They are good singers, good dancers, not to mention they fine as they can be! I can tell they are going to be very successful. I can't wait until their album comes out!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,propulsion techniques:action and reaction,this introduces the laser propulsion to understand easily.
5,Easy to Use,"I have a long shelf full of southwest guidebooks. For the Las Vegas area, Beffort's book is the best choice for people unfamiliar with the desert. It has a good mix of easy and difficult hikes.My sister and her husband recently visited Vegas while I was out of town. He was at a convention; she wanted to see something other than casinos. I turned her loose with a few suggestions and Beffort's book. She did three of the trips in the Spring Mountains and didn't get lost, uncharacteristic for her. The credit goes to good directions in the book."
4,Good guide for desert hiking,"There is enough detail in this book to get to know about the different areas and is good to have on hand while out in the wilderness. We used it this past trip for places within an hr or so from Las Vegas to enjoy some desert hiking. If you are staying in Las Vegas, it gives you directions from there, but a GPS will do just as good (if the reception remains). I recommend visiting Eldorado Canyon and Joshua Tree Wilderness, this is an interesting area is you are not used to seeing this type of plant life. There are even some details about visiting the California border as well! I would say the writer is pretty accurate and the seller got this to me in a reasonable time and was as described! I plan on it's continued use."
5,Afoot and Afield,This will help my wife and me locate the parts of Nevada that we want to visit and enjoy Nevada
1,bumber!,"The product is quoted as saying Jelly Anal Love Beads, its not true, it's very hard plastic, false advertisement, never again."
2,Faire,"I actually could not even complete the book. I feel that the prose is somewhat circular and felt that the book was disorganized. However, my main problem was with the writing. I had a difficult time following the book."
4,Nice for the price!,"I wanted a very particular look when I found this design which was close to what I wanted and very reasonably priced. I replaced the natural colored duck fabric panels with crinkle ivory sheer fabric, and rubbed a little gold paint onto the black metal frame. The result is beautiful and the more formal look I had in mind."
1,The Earth Chronicles in General,"I love Sitchin but the OCR the publisher used to convert to digital should be double checked. There are so many misspelled words (every MODERN has been converted to MODEM) that anyone taking a minute to proof read what has been produced would notice that there weren't too many modems in ancient Sumeria! Other examples of misinterpreted words are so prevalent that one loses faith in a convincing argument. Also, really important maps are such low resolution that they are unreadable even when enlarged. Like I said, I love Sitchin but the publisher should be embarrassed about putting out such poor work and this applies for all the Earth Chronicles books. 5 Stars to Sitchen, 1 star to the publisher!"
5,STUNNNNNNING!,"A most fascinating chronology of forbidden times! No need to review this book, because it is larger than life. It put a big question mark on the origin of mankind and that's more than enough for me! A masterpiece!"
1,This guy is nuts,Sitchin must be an alien. He is obviously writing books tomake money. That is his true motivation. He is in disagreementwith some of the best archeologists of this century.Wake up! The guy is out to make a profit and laugh on his wayto the bank.
1,False Advertising,If you want portable airplane Yahtzee perfect for you. If your looking for a rolling board to play Yahtzee it didn't even come with one? It shows in the picture and description? Confused.
2,Deceptive,I bought this item with the expectation it was new. Although it was in the box it was clear that it was not new. The rotors were broken and the paint was chipped and some of it had clearly been touched up.
2,Broken on arrival,"I've ordered two of these helicopters. Both have arrived with broken rotors. The current seller only does refunds (no exchanges), so I'm sending them back and ordering again hoping to get an unbroken one. It's frustrating since overall this is a very nice piece."
4,Good product,Product was as described and served it's purpose well.I particularly liked the fold up allen wrenches.They are portable and can be carried in your pocket.
1,Sad,"Sad when someone creating videos about the Bible doesn't even know if we can trust what it says, i.e. Phil says we can't really know what ""day"" means in Genesis 1. Also the ark was a pitiful bathtub ark instead of representing the real thing. A cartoon about Truth should at least be truthful."
2,Disappointing,"The creators of this show take the stance that Christians cannot know the truth of a seven day creation. It leaves it up in the air and allows for two schools of interpretation. A quick review of the Biblical text of Genesis and a cursory, brief knowledge of evolution show they are diametrically opposed. One is wrong the other right. We will not let our children watch this again as we do want them to understand the Bible is true and reliable.I let it have two stars because my wife wrote this review and she is more generous than myself :)"
2,my kid didnt like it at all,she didnt even pay attention to it even though i tried refocusing her. the puppets arent bery interesting and often hard to understand.
5,My kids love What's in the Bible!,"I was hesitant to buy more than just the first volume of this series for fear that my kids (2 boys ages 4 & 3) would not be interested in it. The first 3 times they watched in was on a road trip in the car with their headphones on. Of all of the movies they watched, this one made them laugh out loud several times. Since then, when they mention something about a bible story, I ask if they learned that at church, and they say they learned it from What's In The Bible. I will definitely be purchasing more of these videos."
5,Great Find!,"I bought this after seeing some clips on jellytelly.com. This is one of the best children DVD's I have ever watched. Phil Visher does a great job explaining what the Bible is and where it came from. It teaches difficult concepts in a way that children can understand. It is fun and interesting, even for adults. I bought the second DVD and love it too."
4,If you want to know about the open source business model (with a case study) this is a good read,"I learned a lot about business models around open source as well as the different licensing models. I'm a tech CEO and learning about the open source model and the fundraising aspects is interesting for someone with my background. Some of the other reviews made me a little iffy on this book but I'm glad a read it. There were a few sections I skipped over, but I do that with all non-fiction books I read to get business ideas."
3,Download this book,"Young convincingly reminds the reader that the OSS leader really wants to be the Heinze ketchup of the computer industry - a brand name users can trust. What the book boasts in simplicity of message, it lacks in sincerity and genuine insight. This is not a computer manual, but rather a basis for doing business in the open source market place (like you were going to start). The problem is, Young decides to write his company's history minutes before going public. Quite period? Not a good time to write a book."
2,Boring,"The suits give each other millions of dollars.Robert Young styles himself as a salesman, not a technical type, and it shows.Meanwhile the real story goes untold."
1,very very poor,"didn't get what i expected, doesn't make sense at all and not worth the price .i cant call this a movie or anything fun to watch . i really regret buying this ."
1,silly!,You know it is possible that someone likes this...but women picking nits off each other is not excitingVintage Lesbian Erotica (Uncensored Version)
5,Spectacular piano trio,"I'd like to echo the comments of J. Dennis. This is a great trio recording--interesting original compositions, superb rhythm section, and a pianist with great technique and a complete command of the modern idiom. Simply one of the best trio recordings of the last few years, beautifully recorded in France. This CD is from 2003. What has happened to Gajo since? This guy is too good to be ignored."
3,action flicks,"Sunny Deol in another of his formula action flicks.Salaakhen was just mind-blowing and kind of crazy. Sunny plays this simple guy, who is forced to take the law (as usual) in his own hands and goes beyond the limits to get justice after his father (Anupam Kher) is humiliated by a false conspiracy, which leads to suicide in court. From the point where Sunny is jailed and the rest of the film to the end (to the end) reminds you of Ghayal, especially because he is outraged by so much corruption in the law. The action occurred in the last 30 minutes of the movie (more would have helped). Amrish Puri is the greatest villain out there, but there is another 'baddy' responsible for the trouble (watch to find out who). This climax is long with a car chase and a short bus stunt. Overall, this movie may not be as great as Ziddi, but it is alright. Watch it for Sunny Deol!"
3,"<<3>> Stars because of her BOLDNESS, I have much much Respect.","(First Star taken off) because the sister cannot rap lol.. She either too angry or too eager to display any real talent... I am a HUGE fan of sister souljah as a person, as a political and activist figure representing our People... but I had to pop this CD out, I felt like she was screamin at me... Just yellin and angry (obviously)... But, I will simply hold on to it as a collectible out of respect and admiration for this woman of Power and Dignity. Some of the lyrics were a lil extra hateful, but you know... to each his own... I prefer to hear More about Resolutions than Problems.. but We can't address one without the other.. (Second Star taken off for that) This album didn't have enough of a balance for me, too much blame, not enough positive reinforcement of how we're going to overcome some of these obsticles Anyway.. I'm a proud black woman so I can do is respect the sister for her opinions. No regrets with this purchase."
2,This album deserves its obscurity,"Forget the politics, the album is just musically poor. Most of it boils down to pretty talentless, often amusical whiny chatter.At the time, this lady was a girlfriend of one of the members of Public Enemy. She did get one song from them--Final Solution: Slavery's Back in Effect, and it is just so much better than anything else on the album that it's embarrassing. If you have to get anything from her, get the single."
2,Pretty Disapointing,"In retrospect I wouldn't buy this map. I never used it once we got to the islands because there were better maps available for free. The level of detail is poor, you could print out a map online that would be better. Not recommended."
2,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered a 5-Piece LR44 Alkaline battery tearstrip, but was only sent two batteries. I needed three batteries for my calculator. I was unsuccessful in reaching the vendor who did not answer my e-mails or phone call. I finally gave up and bought the remaining battery at a local store."
2,Not Mapped Out,"The book is a self-described study in how WWI was fought in each major battle. It certainly is a detailed chronicle, although unevenly written and, despite the author's best attempts, anglo-centric. Another limitation: all the battles described are from the Western Front. But what makes this book frustrating is the paucity of maps. There are less than a dozen crude maps making it impossible to follow most of the troop movements described in the text, unless you bring your own."
3,Nothing new,"No great discoveries or breakthrough research. A compendium of existing work, acceptable for someone not well read on the subject. I definitely do not recommend it for WWI buffs."
2,Ehh not a fan,"I love a good history book. This was not one. I was looking for something good like ""Guns of August."" This was not it"
4,Good overview,A good summary of the major events in world war one makes it easier to get this all in perspective
3,POOR SOUND QUALITY RUINS GREAT PERFORMANCES,"Let me get right to the point here. Great line ups, wonderful song selection, excellent performances. All ruined by some of the most horrific sound quality ever to be put on c.d. So in closing, let me say, if you can put up with the poor sound qualiy, everything else on this c.d. is great. However, if you are a genuine audiophile, I think you will be just as disappointed with this release as I am.Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful,Tom"
1,This book is a fantasy,"This book is in no way a serious study of the topic of Indian mounds, and is so poorly written that the zingers leap off nearly every page. Of course the author brings up the hoary chestnut of the ancient copper trade between Indians in Michigan and the Phoenicians, which perhaps is an interesting idea, but nothing that has be borne out by actual evidence, and the statement that the ancient Indian site of Aztalan (Wisconsin) was a major copper refining center, which by her description sounds like heavy industry in Pittsburgh in 1950. However, when I got to the part about the war between the Sauk Indians and some group (I can't remember the name as I started laughing so hard) in the Near East!, I had to put it down. At best, this book is a curiosity, the work of an eccentric mind. Utter rubbish. The author's PhD should be revoked retroactively for her publishing this nonsense."
5,Strong Album,"With the bleak state of (mainstream) rap these days, Sean Price latest is effort is a welcome reprise. Good production, strong beats, but most importantly solid and versatile lyircal content. Very back to basics NY style flow and song construct. Sean Price's lyrics have a good mix of street grit, self-deprecating humor, and real street tales. That said, his album isn't the usual laundry list of I did this, I shot him, and sold that. A concept of story telling and innovative thought that is almost dead, so if you like Ghost, Jedi Mind, Cunninlynguists, Pumpkinhead, even Nas, you'll enjoy. (Someone please send to 50 and Dipset). Liked another reviewers comparison to Ghost, both for consistency and effort in all songs on the album - almost no throwaways. One of my boy's said he could hear ""SEAN P"" shout as background in any song and feel it and I'd have to agree. Highly reccomended for rap heads looking for good, innovative production, good flow, and versatile lyrical content..."
5,Pretty amazing!,I love this stuff! I never saw anything like it before where I live. You put it in hot water and while stirring away BAM there is gravy! It just happens and its flavorful and has good body to it.Also its great thickener for soups and stews. Give one a try and see what you come up with it. It certainly will not go to waste in you cupboard. A Nice staple for just when you need it.
3,"LOVE, LOVE Bisto! Don't like This flavor though",Bisto is the absolute best gravy maker there is! I couldn't possibly live without it.But I tried the chicken flavor and hated it. I use the favourite flavor for everything- all meets and poultry. The favourite just tastes better and works with everything well.That's just my opinion! Sorry Bisto manufacturer!
1,Zero Good,"This product has done me no good at all...for all I can tell the mosquitos might love it! I lit two of them, one on either side of me, and it didn't change a thing. A little cigar smoke does a better job!"
4,Krusell Multidapt Case for Palm Treo 680,Very nice case and fit for Treo 680. I recommend using egrips to hang on to the slippery Treo. The cover is a little stiff and it takes a while for the cover to catch the magnet. I wish the case came with an inside pocket for holding business cards.
2,I thought it was gonna be the bomb,"I thought this case was going to end my search. Especially after waiting almost 6 months for it to come into stock. Finally I realized that I could buy it from SF through amazon. I wonder why they had it in stock but Amazon never told me? Anyway, I like the basic design and concept. The problem is the magnetic latch. After a week or so I decided I was tired of my treo700p skating across the pavement. It had a tendency to lose it's battery in the process too. I would like the same case with a real latch. For now the little pouch that came with my computer backpack is filling the niche.Update Jan 2013: I found that this case does work well for the original Motorola Droid. I haven't had it pop out without request yet after probably 2 years of use. It doesn't fit the fantastic S3 but as a case for my backup phone it's been working well."
5,I used this book so much I litterally wore it out.,"I was given this classic about 15 years ago. It was the basis of everything I ever knew about programming in Atari BASIC. Now I am learning Visual Basic and C++. All the basic concept I laened from Dr. C. Wacko still aply. It's unfortunate that due to the fact Atari BASIC and Atari computers have become obsolete, so has this hilarious and educatonal book. It's better than the ""complete idiot's guide's"" or ""...for dummies"" books could ever hope to be. Wouldn't it be great if David Heller wrote new books for current programming languages?"
3,"Good fact-bites, but coherency suffers from organization","This is a fact-bite-like presentation of the life of the famous queen. The bits are compelling, but they fail to link together to give a reader much of an idea of what Cleopatra was really like, and the speculations upon motivations come out rather dry. Human motivations and the personal story is lost in the organization, and since that is usually what makes a biography so fascinating, it is unfortunate. The DK Eyewitness-eque format works best for the thematic arrangement of information, not a narrative of a life. Still, it was fairly interesting reading (if disjointed), and it was put together attractively.Here are some alternatives:Beautifully illustrated biography for the same roughly the age group:Cleopatra by Diane StanleyFor slightly older readers, a humorous but very compelling biography:Cleopatra and Her Asp by Margaret Simpson"
5,Delightful flavor with intense burn,"I've enjoyed Dave's Total Insanity for over a decade now. It's by far my number one favorite hot sauce of all time.Dave's Gourmet makes a variety of ""Insanity"" themed hot sauces including ""Temporary Insanity"", ""Ultimate Insanity"", and more. But of them all, ""Total Insanity"" has the best flavor to my palate. Dave's Total Insanity has strong overtones of garlic which I really like combined with a tangy lime hit but just a touch of smokiness. The overall flavor profile is just divine.Then the burn hits.And what a burn! It's terrifyingly powerful, inducing screams, dizziness, tears, and more. The endorphin rush from Dave's Total Insanity is absolutely the bomb. I eat more and more, unable to stop this coaster-ride of fantastic flavor and furious fire. I sweat, I cry, I shudder, I double over, and then I hit that pain-induced high and I just float as the room spins away.Thanks, Dave."
4,Yum.,"I like these a lot, one of the better tasting low-carb bars. I ordered them because the store was out even though another reviewer said they came melted twice. Mine came in great shape, maybe they fixed the problem."
3,Great tasting bars - but arrived melted & inedible,"These are the best tasting Atkins bars by far - however I ordered these twice through Amazon and both times they arrived badly melted. Amazon to their credit reimbursed me for the cost of the bars, but I would not recommend ordering these online as they are clearly not kept in cool enough storage or delivery trucks."
4,A suspenseful plot,The history behind this story was very educational. I think she her knowledge of Washington D.C. was used to an advantage in the story. The plot kept the reader in suspense until the very end.
3,"OK, but I guessed the murderer","The book was good as most of her books are but from the beginning, I knew it had to be one of the Episcopal priests - there was no other choice. Not her best."
1,Osam Binmodia,"i liked this book because it had a good story to it and it was action packed, interesting book. i loved it it was my favorite book"
5,Great source for digital success!,I found this book to be very helpful in producing excellent digital images. The examples were extremely well explained. Editing and creating a final product are important when using a digital camera and this book covered the topics really well.
1,This book tells you essentially nothing about the topic.,"This book is an OK overview of some basic photo software techniques, but really fails to say much about digital photography, that being the use of digital cameras. If you want a book that's mostly about photo editing software you could do much better, and that's the fundamantal point to this book. If you actually want to learn about digital cameras and digital photography look elsewhere, because this book has very little to say on the topic."
2,Didn't learn what I was looking for.,"I don't use Photo Elements. I also already know how to turn the camera on and press the shutter release. I was hoping this book would be like a beginning photo course, and that I would at least see some features like shutter vs aperature priorities, but I didn't see that type of stuff. (Actually I have done a bit of normal 35mm SLR stuff, it is only digital that is new to me). If you are a total newbie to all photography then this book would be better."
5,NFL Dallas Cowboys Stop Sign,I love the Cowboys and this is a great way to express it! This is a great gift item too! I am Cowboys fan what else can I say?...except for the Redskins suck! ;)
5,Fantastic,"He breaks down Civil Procedure into easy to understand and easily digestible components. He makes my two hour, traffic-ridden car rides to my fiance more productive. He helped me score an awesome grade on my Civ Pro exam, and he helped me prepare for class every day. The best part was he only cost 70 bucks. Anyone who has the pleasure of listening to these lectures will not be disappointed."
4,Great for Civ Pro 1,If you are an auditory learner and want to get the big picture of Civil Procedure this is very helpful. The Professor is very endearing and helps simplify complicated topics like Erie. It helped me alot during finals prep.
5,A great substitute for a box container,My silver was purchased more than 4 decades ago and the box it came in has disintegrated. This product is a great replacement in that it is sturdy enough to store silverware; it comes with a tarnish-retardant lining; it zips so I can take out what I need without lifting the entire compartment out of the drawer. It is softer and offers some flexibility so that I can store additional items in the same drawer of the breakfront. It holds more than one set of flatware.
4,hagerty zipper silver case.,"This item is as advertized, a useful size that holds a generous amount of silver. I think the usually advertized price is unnecessarily high for what it actually consists of, although, with a little research I was able to find it at this somewhat lower cost.Amazon is the place to look!"
3,"""Absurdist Qualities""","The historical potrayal of the 1948 War is well-done and realistic for the most part. Subsequently the film feels too ""artsy/poetic""--over-endowed with metaphors, symbols and absurdist episodes. This would have been a much better film without the surreal quality."
5,The Voice`,"A lot of people hate on my man TIM DOG. (Mostly because he's dissin your favorite rappers/groups.) This record is CLASSIC! A TRUE HIP HOP ARTIST speaking his mind and making great records. This whole album is good. It takes a lot to stand alone, but obviously he wasn't because his fan base was strong. People felt the same as he did, he was the voice for a lot of us. We may have liked the music he was dissin, but the artists were FAKE! He just pointed that out. If you haven't heard the album or don't know its history--definitely look into it. Peace!"
5,Tim Dog is the man,"Tim Dog is the man, or should say the motherf**king man (as he would put it). He's is by far one of the corniest rappers in the history of rap, but the beats are slammin' and his lyrics are funny as hell. I love this CD. It's truly entertaining. SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN!"
5,much more tan I expected,"For next to nothing I got more than I expected. This unit works as explained in the directions. I have had 2 addresses that the unit couldn't find and have not yet asked for help from customer service, but I will.I would buy this same unit again if I needed another GPS"
4,Why add a battery?,"I don't see what's the point on having a battery? From all the reviews I've read, they all complain on not having a battery built in. In my opinion all you're going to do is hop in the car and get from point A to point B. If you need to stop at a gas station why do you still need the GPS unit on? If you turn your car off and then turn it back on again, it will still remember the point where you stopped and continue from there. I can see ways you will need a battery like updating your address book or something, but please! It's not a palm pilot.So what if it take a little while to search satellites again!, it's a normal process from being on the off position. You guys should really listen to your selves. What else do you want? You want the GPS to start talking to you like K.I.T.T from Knight Rider? LOL! Just be happy you're not lost. I recommend this product hands down. And forget about having a battery on the unit, it's useless!"
1,Defective unit and nightmare support,"Bought this product from Amazon and didn't work as described. Either Amazon shipped me a refurbished product or their software is defective. After startup, it found my location (lats) pretty quick, but would not display any maps, POIs or let me add addresses.Called their support line and got someone who didn't know their way around tech support. I am returning this unit. Glad I didn't buy it as a gift."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my husband, and it did work well at first, but within one week we found that it was locking up and had to send it back. I have since read that this is commonly occuring problem with this item. Amazon handled the return fairly graciously. My husband did his own research and purchased a Tom Tom which has been fantastic and has more options."
3,Below average,"If I had paid more than the price of 250$, I would have been very upset. But, for this price. Its ok.The user interaction/ route calculation is very slow. The text search is very weak."
4,Plug and Play,"Bought my 360 only 24 hours ago. Went out of store with box and was up and running in my vehicle in less than 10 minutes. It has thus far found every address I've punched in (the only interesting development was that it told me my home was on the left side of the street rather than the right). So far, I believe it to be good value for the money."
1,Absolute Junk!!,"I received one of these for christmas.The Item turned on perfectly,but thats about all it did perfectly.It gave me ""map not found"" right out of the box.I contacted Magellans pathetic customer support.When they finally replied,they told me I was basically out of luck,that they dont service this model anymore,and I could send it back and purchase a different model at a resonable rate!!! Cripes!! I got the stupid piece of junk for Christmas,why in the heck would I want to spend money on another one of their Items when this one didn't even work out of the box.The bottom line is,I got a new paperweight for christmas.This Item could be fixed with a service update and they know it.Do yourself a favor,do not purchase anything from Magellan.Customer support is terrible.Product support is non-existant.Always remember....Get a..get a..get a GARMIN!!!"
1,not to be relied upon,"Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Takes a very long to find position. I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing it. I would have chosen another."
4,"Good, esp for price",Like the features after spending some time to get to know them. This is strictly for the car and the pain of a long cigarette lighter/ 120V cord stretching across to a good spot on your windshield hurts. I would prefer something that can work on its on battery w/ help of solar if it existed but such is life and my tight wallet. Again great for the price.
3,Magellan RoadMate 360 - A good buy,"Magellan RoadMate 360 is worth the price(under $200).However, many times it takes sometime for it to locate itself. I am hoping that upgrading the software that runs this GPS will fix this problem. I have not done that yet.If you don't want to spend a whole lot of money on a GPS, this is a good buy."
3,just ok,"I like it, but you have to watch, it will tell you toturn on one way streets. I listen to it and it got me a ticket.I listen to the wrong voice."
5,Magellan RoadMate 360 GPS,Wonderful..... I don't know what I did all this time without one. It is such a time saver and a magical device. I recommend it to everytone.
4,nice and handy,Like it very much . Easy to swich from vehicles. Not as accarute as I would like it to be. Easy user freindly.
2,Magellan 360 -not so great,"This unit is not nearly as simple to program and use as they lead you to believe. I am fairly well versed in electronics, and I am not at all impressed w/ this navigation system. I have had opportunity to use a Tom Tom and a garmin, both in the same price range, and they are so much simpler to use-you do not even need the instructions!!"
3,OK for a Cheap GPS,"If you are looking for a cheap GPS. This unit does the Job. The User Interface is a bit clunky and it's slow, but it does work. The unit is not smart enough to figure out what you are trying to enter regarding streets that have several names. This is a decent entry level GPS. I returned it and went with the Garmin Nuvi 360 since I had the extra $$$ and it's Absolutely AWESOME."
3,GPS,Not happy with difficulty in programmng. It took a long time to program and it was not user friendly
3,"Great product, but irritating at times!","To begin with I loved this product. I was really impressed by the plug and go fetures. I was also impressed that it recognized the local streets where we live (in rural MS). But when you go to enter an address it tries to determine what you are typing, and only lets you type the letters that it wants you to type. Sometimes you must try several options, for instance you can search for Walmart, and you only get hits in other surrounding states, but if you search by city, and then by grocery, then you find the local one...Just some advice if you purchase this product."
4,good product,"this is a good entry level GPS bought it for my wife not as good as the one factory installed on my car but also $1000 cheaper I would recommend it for the price to anybody, easy to use out of the box.. Good Product!!"
3,"Works well, would like better updates (found missing addresses_)","This GPS gets the basics done, and belive me I am glad to have it if I get lost, but it does lack on its mapping and finding a location/business. I know for instance when searching for a Walmart when one was close by, it wasn't able to locate it or direct me to it, and it was not a recent build, it was a location that has been around for over a decade."
2,Magellan GPS,"The unit worked, but the maps were outdated. The windshield mount was very awkard and had one part that was prone to break. The one part did break and the customer service from magellan was AWFUL. The unit was still under warranty but they kept putting me off. I called six times over two months and they said each time that they were mailing me the new part. When I would call to follow up after not receiving the part they would say they just got them in and would mail it that day. I will never buy another Magellan product."
2,Poor quality and HORRIBLE customer service,"My unit worked well for a short while then broke. It suddenly stopped turning on. Sent in for service under warranty. Their customer service is HORRIBLE! So far they have had it for 2 months. There is no communication about it, and every time I call I get their call center in India and the people there have no idea what the status of the unit is. They read from a script and are entirely unhelpful. I am never buying another Magellan product ever, and I recommend no one else does either."
1,Not for the heartland,"On main roads it's ok, but in the country it useless. it takes the long way no matter how hard you try major roads are missing. IT'S a toy at best"
4,Great low budget,"I also own the Magellan 750, it works very much the same.I would like to see improvements in that class of GPS systems such as reading the road name, lookup a business by phone number and blue tooth integrations."
3,Good value for the price,"I found this unit heavily discounted to about $200. The first unit I recieved was defective. It rebooted on it's own after about 20 minutes of use. From what I've read, this is a common manufacturing issue. Amazon replaced it easily.The second unit works fine. Occasionally it has trouble finding it's current location, but usually recovers when I get out in the open. The text entry interface is good, but not great. Finding addresses using route numbers is nearly impossible. The map data seems to support the local street names instead. It took a little while to become accustomed to how it gives audible instructions and all the data it displays, but now that I've used if for a while, I am pleased with it."
1,"Dont' bother, buy a Mio","I had this unit and a MIO 310 on a 3 hour trip side by side. The MIO worked perfect and never froze and had all the POIs, plus the menus were easy to use and understand, very nice display. This one on the other hand, froze all the time, wanted to take me in the wrong direction, and the menus and ease of use is very confusing and clumsy, not to metion the unit is bulkier and you cannot take it out of the car with you. The price is good, but I was able to buy my MIO on sale for the same price, so it is a much better beagain. the Magellan went back to the store."
4,pretty close to ideal,"The most important thing the roadmate 360 needs is an external antenna (about $60.)Without the antenna, my roadmate would take between 2-5 minutes to lock on to a signal. With the external antenna the roadmate locks on to a signal between 10 seconds and 1 minute. 10 seconds being more common in an open area, up to 1 minute under heavy tree cover. Yes sometimes the unit is annonying when driving down the highway telling you to keep left, then stay to your right. You get used to that pretty quickly. The mapping on the screen makes it pretty easy to figure out which way to go.I was able to figure out the input interface without the manual, so this is a pretty easy unit to work with.I agree not having an internal battery is a weak spot. It would be nice to have the unit stay on for up to 10 minutes or so when gassing up etc...It is great using the unit when you don't know where you are, or how to get where you are going."
2,Too many limitations,"I tried the RoadMate 360 but I had to return it. Although it advertizes maps for all of North America, the mapping of the city of Toronto was very incomplete. I called tech support to be sure I was avoiding user error, and even they couldn't find some addresses in Toronto, so it was of no use to me. Disappointing, to say the least."
2,Not What I expected,"While the system came very quickly, it wasn't as advertised (Very good condition). The power cord is ify and randomly shuts down the system if positioned at the wrong angle. It also takes about 10 minutes to find satellite signal so is not practical for in-town trips. The car charger did not work upon arrival. I tried replacing the fuse in it and it blew right through it, so I was forced to buy a new one. While the exterior casing of the system itself was in 'Very Good Condition,' nothing else was."
4,Magellan RoadMate 360 GPS Portable Navigator,"Very happy with gps. Works great. Only complaint is you only have the female voice, the male voice does not work."
4,Magellan Roadmate 360,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and all in all it lives up to the reviews that I had read before. I like that it is easy to use and set up. My only dislike is that I feel the maps it came preloaded with are out of date. We recently drove down to the coast of NC and there was a new bypass that has been open for a while. The preloaded map did not have the new road on it. We contacted Magellan who said an update only comes out about every 18mths and there is not one currently scheduled. Disapointing as we live in an area of large growth.
2,Interesting for 10 minutes,This game is a complete waste of time. by far the most unrealistic hunting game ever.Anyone that has ever hunted will toss this game out quick.
2,PLEASE!,"Game is primative! Cartoon graphics, arthritic animals that will not die without a head shot! An annoying over voice giving snide comments on your marksmanship,shall I go on? Game seems to slow down and speed up to the point where I turn it off in discust. If Deer Hunter 2005 were a new Porsche, Hunting Unlimited 3 would be a very old,WORN OUT Volkswagen. Get Deer Hunter 05,Trophy Hunter, or the Cabelas Dangerous Hunts. Cabelas Big Game Hunter would not play in my PC at all. Little help from Activision, but thats another review."
1,U haven't shipped it to review it!!,"In wouuld be happy to review this item but since I ordered this on July 4th, 2006 but you still have not shipped the game. When are you going to ship it??? If I go to reorder it, it says 2 weeks for delivery. Since you don't seem to be able to get this item why does it still say 2 weeks for delivery since by now you know this item is not available."
2,Not an easy read,"I got this after a friend, who is a day trader, recommended it to me. I got part way through it and found that the author spends too much time going into the history of investing and explaining why things are the way they are. I wanted something that explained how to invest in bonds, without understanding how that market developed over the last 100 years. I have an MBA and another business degree, but not a lot of investing knowledge, so others may like this approach. Guess I need bond investing for dummies first."
5,Excellent book on bonds!,"""The Stategic Bond Investor"" is a great way to increase your knowledge about bonds, as well as investing in bonds. I know a great deal about stocks, as well as investing in general, but after spending a lot of time reading about bonds on the morningstar website, it became clear I did NOT know much about bond investing. Several of the knowledgeable posters kept recommending the same book, over and over, and so I finally bought it. Am now reading it for the second time, a lot of ""meat"" in this book. I'm not sure I digested it all on the first pass. Now that I am in my mid 50's , I realized we needed to increase the bond allocation in our portfolio, especially since I am now semi retired and dependent on investment income. This is a great place to learn about this topic, and will (hopefully) help in making wiser investment choices."
2,"Draft Version....Couldn't be final Version , Is it?","No way this book gets published, except there are a zillion guys like me suffering for an understanding of this Bond Market who will buy a reputable book on the subject.The topic area covered is EXCELLENT . The graphs and attempts to make it understandbable to a college finance grad are challenging. To an average person, no way.This is unfortunate.The author almost does it! This is a good book. But there is no way even an average business grad will absorb what is said. This is unfortunate. IT need not be so complex. I am reading the ebook version , so this is maybe more difficult for such a complex subject.The author needs to bring in a group of interested readers to a viewpoint panel so as to rewrite it and deliver a final version that will enlighten millions more to this complex issue."
5,Excellent coverage of bond markets; good for both the Wall Street and main street,"Most of the fixed income books just cover the mathematical part of the securities, which is important but not sufficient enough for the trading floor terminologies.""The Strategic Bond Investor"" because of its nice top-down approach helps in understanding the whole economic process. The coverage of the Federal Reserve system and how it manages interest rates is great. Also, the yield curve analysis and spread analysis and their historical/ political significance is awesome.I really found the detailed overview of the various important economic indicators very helpful.Again, the book has been written in a way that helps one to become part of the day-to-day happenings in the economy and to understand micro picture from macro level.The Strategic Bond Investor does a great job by educating people both on the Wall Street and on main street."
5,Very good,I enjoyed reading about some of the history of Canada. I vacation at the Algonquin Provincial Park every year. This will be our fifth year. The children had alot of courage and the girl was a little spitfire. I would be interested in reading other historical fiction by this same author. The actual pictures in the book brought the story to life.
4,children went to work for family because father dies,"I found that this book was pretty interesting, but I think it could of been more realalistic to the point where the story was to made up.I dont think that in real life anybody would send two kids out on their own with a worker that broke his leg. But other than that a thought the book had alot of exictement and good explanation during the story. I also believe that your explanation of how the shantymen life was back in the day was very good."
1,sauce of the weak variety,"i saw this band and they rocked, kinda, in a fugazi-y way, you know. kind of emotional rock, you'd tap your toe. so i bought the record after their show and it was super not good. the recording was way weak sauce sounds and the energy was not good. i even think the dude from the band that i bought it from gave some kind of caveat when i forked over my 8 bucks, like 'don't expect alot from this.' o well."
4,A good book,This book is very well written. It has lots of info on the history of the different aircraft manufactures but not a lot on the different types of planes. Lots of great colour photos of many different aircraft. It is a great book for anybody interested in planes.
4,Excellent Alarm with deterrent system,Received a a Christmas gift and it is just what I expected. All of the features that I was looking for at the right price. Keeping the wires hidden is the greatest drawback. I would definitely like a wireless system some time in the future.
4,Gorilla Alarm,"Good alarm for the price. The shock sensor is really sensitive.The pager works well too, just not through brick and steel walls."
2,so-so,"very simple and cheap chinese made system but not for this money, real sux. better to buy something other xxx"
3,Not to good.,"I was a little disappointed by the range, also no battery back up plus the tilt sensor did not work. Tried everything but no dice. Next time I would pay more for something better!"
4,TRACK LISTING:,"1. Surrender Yourself2. Skin Deep3. Sympathy Bouquet4. Solitaire5. Never Ending Winter6. Figure In The Sand7. Her Universe8. What Are You Guilty Of?9. The WayThe Daou is hubby & wifey Peter and Vanessa Daou. For those fans Club/Dance music, you know The Daou for their club hit ""Give Myself To You"" and also Vanessa's sexy remix of ""Two To Tango"". Here is more of a journey into down-tempo electronica but more along the lines of New Age."
5,Great Tool For All Leaders and Hopeful Visionaires,Lorin Beller does a beautiful job of taking readers on a ride through self discovery with practical and uplifting steps for success.
3,"not effective, smaller in size",It is not an effective for pain relief and it is smaller in size and barely fit around neck.
2,There Are Better,"Shipping on this item was very fast.The item you see here on the page (style & color wise) is not what you receive. You get a random pattern/color that they choose.I bought one of these neck wraps at the mall about a year ago as a gift for my mother. It was very nice and she absolutely loved it. So I decided to buy the product for my sister-in-law's birthday and I found it online here. I have to say I'm disappointed. This version of a neck wrap is very flimsy, it feels like there is not much inside and you have to keep adjusting and pushing what's inside to make it comfortable...the one i got at the mall was flexible but full and sturdy as well.The scent with this product is too overpowering. The other one I bought was a very subtle and relaxing scent.Overall this product isn't the best version of these Neck Wraps you can find."
2,Very basic,"This book covers the basics well, but does not cover any concept in depth. This book might be good for undergrad class for introduction class, but not a good one for grad level and one interested in advanced topics in VLSI."
3,"I found it fairly useful. (However, I am a beginner).","I liked the math. I think people should learn to recheck things a little more frequently than they do. I think it was organized well enough to follow coursework. I believe it would be useful to others. I recommend the book.NOTE: However, that I am a beginner, and I can't tell if this would be a good book or not for more advanced individuals."
2,Does not fly straight,"First off, this is a very well made and beautiful kite. It looks excellent while flying. Let me condition that with ""while flying."" The dorsal fin will either tip to the left or right (just a product of how that support latches into the system), which makes it dive uncontrollably to one side or the other. I am in my 30s, an engineer, and very capable of flying a kite. The overall take home: disappointed. Have only used it once, as it was too frustrating to have to keep chasing it down from wherever it crashed."
3,"Decent, but there are better","If you're planning on buying just one Houdini book, go with Kenneth Silverman. Although there are parts of Brandon's book which are excellent, I grew tired of her opinions and psycho-babble. Ultimately, I got the feeling that the author simply didn't like Houdini. Perhaps I should have been warned when reading Brandon's bio: ""She likes to think of biography as a framework within which to look at cultural history."" Houdini was a complex person, to say the least. Personally, I'd rather be presented with the facts so I could form my own opinion."
4,"A good book, but...","Overall, an enjoyable read, but I agree with prior reviewers -- too much Freudian analysis for my taste, and I don't care to hear the author's personal experiences."
2,Not worth the trouble,"As a previous reviewer stated, there are plenty of other good bios of Houdini. This one is full of psychobabble and reads like character assassination. All heroes have feet of clay, but her analysis is repetitive and makes the second half of the book deathly boring."
5,Strongly Suggested Book,This book is good. It has many interesting facts about Houdini. It explains his life and career. I strongly suggest it.
4,Cannes it be true?,"This is a very enjoyable, well researched book. Any fan of Lars von Trier will enjoy reading this even if it means re-reading information they may have come across in the past. Though the Cannes film festival has been a repeated rite of passage for the director, this book obsessively follows von Trier's relationship with the festival as if it were the only event that mattered in his career. Nevertheless, Stevenson does go to great lengths to cover all aspects of von Trier's life, professional and personal in equal measure.Overall, this is an excellent book that provides a witty, insightful view into the mind of a very important artist."
5,All is well in the Glorious House of Sinanju,"I have to say while I haven't been thrilled with the Destroyer series lately, it is still a must read. I am esctatic that GE can get these books out on time. I like the story in this latest installment and I like the fact that it is going to arc into a miniseries. Remo's adventures have always been part political satire part history lesson rolled into an adventure story. This book goes back to what made this series so enthralling to begin with."
5,The DESTROYER is BACK!!!!!,I thought the series was on its last leg. But the new guy seems to know what he is doing. Keep up the good work!!!!
2,Cuisinart Nylon Turner review,"Prior to buying, did research on turners; this was one of 3 best I found.Good: The beveled edges do a good job of handling food products.Poor: Even with spraying, food sticks to the spatula just like all other spatulas; not worth the extra money, including shipping, paid for the product."
4,Great spatula,"How does one review a spatula? Well, it works well. My last spatula left. It just vanished. I hope this one (solid & nice grip) hangs around."
4,Something different from Bollywood,"A good horror film for the early 90's.It was very different and unique for its time. It's not classified as a horror film but as a romantic thriller. However, I still found it scary as a kid.This is definitely one of Salman's better films during that era.If you like supernatural mysteries.The film has everything; comedy, action, suspense, horror, mystery, fantasy and off course, singing and dancing"
2,wig does NOT look like the pic!!,please do not buy this wig go by the pic that they have representing it! rad bad. i was not happy at all with what i recieved.
2,could have been better,"I purchased this wig for a themed 2nd wedding ceremony my husband and I had in Vegas this past July. The price was reasonable and it arrived on time but it looks almost NOTHING like the picture (texture & volume - even after picking it out for what seemed like an hour) and was tight on my husband's head. Overall, it suited its purpose but not recommended."
1,afro wig-don't bother,"Looks nothing like the picture.....even after ""picking"" it out for 30 minutes. Very bummmed."
5,Plus is the way to go,IF YOU MUST USE ENSURE OR JUST LIKE TO ADD TO YOUR DIET PLUS IS THE WAY TO GO FOR THAT EXTRA CALORIE BOOST.
5,"Bargain price and Amazon Prime, too","Amazon's current subscription cost of 24 8-oz bottles of ENSURE Plus Complete Nutrition is $29.34, which amounts to $7.34 for 6 bottles--less than ""Stop 'n Shop or CVS in Boston area"" stated in the least favorable review or even the current Sam's Club price--and you may cancel the subscription without penalty at any time."
4,Ensure cocktail,"I used this after dental surgery and it was very helpful to boost my nutritional intake. I didn't like the taste too much, found it too sweet, so I mixed it with yogurt, which improved not only the taste, but also the consistency, making it thicker and more filling. Also try mixing it with strawberry or wild berry for an interesting variation."
1,Tastes terrible,"If I did not have to drink this I certainly would not. The taste is nauseous, and I can barely keep it down."
4,My husband loves it,"My husband has settled on creamy milk chocolate as his favorite flavor. In order to keep his weight up, he must drink two Ensure Plus per day. On Amazon Subscribe & Save it was much more affordable than running to the drugstore every week for more. We are very disappointed that Amazon no longer offers this on Subscribe & Save. It looks like only Vanilla and Strawberry are available now. This is hugely inconvenient. Amazon, please find a replacement supplier!"
3,Home Made Vanilla Tastes Better,"All Ensure products are a blessing for those who need them. Ensure Plus Homemade Vanilla seems to be disappearing from production. When I order that flavor, I receive Vanilla flavor. Am I alone in thinking that the Homemade Vanilla flavor tastes better?"
1,Terrible service.,I have cancelled this order but it keeps coming. Do not get involved in an automatic delivery. Very difficult company to deal with.
1,This Product Works!,I needed a supplement to help me maintain a healthy weight. Ensure tastes great and is helping me put on a few pounds. Scheduled delivery arrangement save monthly reordering.
5,I'm satisfied,"very nice. It really helped me with gaining weight which is what i have been perusing. Not to mention that i took it next to my meal, and NOT as a meal replacement"
5,Milwaukee's Big Boy!,"If you want a true under the table router or the best fixed base router, this is the one to get. I've owned and used this one for about three years and I've yet to slow it down with any bit or job. It runs like a swiss clock. Be sure you are plugged into at least a 20 amp circuit to allow it to demonstrate its power. I replaced the 1 3/4 Milwaukee I had under the table with this one and am very pleased. (I still use the 1 3/4 because I like the molded one hand grip for edge and free had routing). Do I have other routers? Yes but none that have the power, accuracy, ease of use and dependability of this one."
4,"Lots of power and great above the table adjustment feature, but...","January 2007:Like another user/reviewer, I've had issues powering up this router. I use this router exclusively on my router table which has an outboard switch. It usually takes a few tries to get going. However, once it turns over, I won't have anymore issues for the remainder of the day. Needs to be warmed up, I guess. Not a huge issue for now, but I worry that some day it won't start at all.Update: Sept 2007Still plaqued with the initial startup issue. On the plus side, it has lots of power and I've used it to make many raised panel doors without any issues. It is surprisingly quiet compared to my 1.5 hp PC router. I am fairly happy with my purchase."
3,kidcord,router worked great for a few cabinet builds then the speed control feedback module crapped out replaced that at a cost of $58.00 and now the brushes need replacement. Still a good router however spend the extra $$$$$$ and buy a porter-cable!!! this just in eight months later the speed control feedback module has died again!!!!!!!!! this router is now headed for the junkyard do not purchase this tool..
5,Top of the line,"This router has no vices whatsoever. It is exceedingly powerful as you would expect from 3.5 HP, has adjustments for variable speeds, an easy bit-change mechanism, etc., but the least expected plus is how quiet it is, about the same as a drill press believe it or not. I mounted it in my table and made some different-depth test cuts in scrap hard wood. As I made deeper cuts, it did not seem to affect performance in the least. There are a lot of good routers on the market; I rate this one superior."
3,Less Than Happy!,"I Bought this to replace a Porter Cable in our Shopbot cnc Router.Initially the smoothness and quiet running was enough to make me Happy.It also has much more power than the Porter Cable. The downer isthe bearings wore out in half the time of the Porter Cable.So, I'm going to put in new bearings and give it another shot!If I have different results I will post them but for know dissappointed!"
2,Not what you expect from Milwaukee!,I purchesed this router just over 3 years ago for my router table. The first Job I did it worked great but I don't use the above table adjuster and pull the router out to change bits every time so things don't bind up as bad as when you leave it in the base all of the time. My problem started with my second set of kitchen cabinets and the brushes went out in the middle of the job doing raised panel doors. Abuot a year later the brushes had to be replaced again and now a year after that its in the shop again with something wrong with the speed control. I was doing 4 raised panel doors when it started acting up this time. The only ones I have done since the last time it was in the shop. I have been trying to figure out what to replace it with as I can't have it break down every time I start a new job.
4,Add dust collection and you get 5 stars,"I was shopping for a Porter Cable 7518. I happened to run into the Milwaukee 5625-20 and it turns out to be a near clone of the PC, but with a few superior features. #1 is true variable speeds, rather than 5 speeds with the PC. #2 is a far superior system for raising and lowering the router in a router table. The PC 7518 motor screws up or down in a track that jams up with sawdust, while the height adjustment of the Milwaukee can be done above the table and the clamp is a lever, rather than a nasty, hard to operate screw. To change bits, I unlock the lever, push the screw release button and drop the motor out of the base. Add two substantial machined wrenches instead of the tacky stamped sheet steel wrenches that Porter Cable provides and you have a near perfect router for under table use.My only complaint is the lack of dust control. By the time you've milled all the pieces for a frame and panel passage door you will be up to your ankles in sawdust."
2,Not for router table,"I bought this router intending to make it a dedicated router for my router table because of the power and above table height adjustment.The height adjustment stopped working properly after about three hours of moderate use. I took it to both authorized Milwaukee repair shops in Denver and they couldn't figure out what the problem was so they ordered a new router that had the same problem, even before any use. I was told by a Milwaukee repair agent that despite the advertising and built in above table height adjustment, this router really wasn't designed to be adjusted from above the table using the supplied wrench because of it's weight????Milwaukee did do the right thing and refund my money but it cost time and frustration dealing with an apparently poorly designed tool."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM,"The attractive selling feature for this particular router was the ""above table height adjustment"", but the screw shaft is poor designed, and depended on plastic parts which fail when used frequently.I purchased this router because it provided a built in above table height adjustment. The router by itself has a good motor, but if you plan to use it mounted under a table while making adjustments from above, it will fail in time, while parts slip out of place.The local service center has already replaced the button once, while they are currently in the process of replacing the plastic hex nut that sits on the top of the screw shaft.It is an expensive tool that does not do what it is supposed to. If I were to do it over again, I would purchase a separate router while additionally purchasing a lift mechanism."
4,a serious tool,"This router has some serious power! The soft start is a wonderful feature. The lower speeds are great for panel work. The feedback circuitry and the 3.5 hp motor can tackle some serious projects. I would give this 5 stars, yet my only complaint is the bulk of the machine and the large handles. They make it a bit hard to manuever, but I guess with this amount of power, you need a serious grip on this machine. Highly recommended!"
3,Watch out for raising mechanism,"If you purchased one of these machines,,,,be aware that the raising and lowering mechanism is susceptible to slipping. Milwaukee has come up with a solution so that it will not slip or you can have it correted at an authorized repair center. The new ones that are being manufactured are already corrected. Unfortunately I purchased one of the first ones made. It worked great for 6 months,,,,,then slip, slip, slip.Other than that, I really like the machine. It is a horse that performs beyond expectations."
4,Great Router,Great tool but did not need the adjustment tool. The adjustment tool came with the router. Now I have 2 adjustment tools.
3,Difficulty mounting to table,"I thought I was doing good on researching this router, but now I'm frustrated. It seems my portable Craftsman 10 inch table saw with router assy table WILL NOT line up to this router! It now seems that there are several companies that sell lifts, but that forces me into purchasing another table too!Do your homework before purchasing this router. Expect to pay another $350.00 on up to be able to use this mounted on under a table. Lifts are made by Jessem, Benchdog, and woodpecker. Perhaps you should just purchase a shaper if you are looking for something with this kind of HP."
4,Comprehensive and well-organized reference,"I have used FileMaker for many years and found the FileMaker Pro Bible to be an excellent reference and learning tool. Although I consider myself a more advanced user, this book could certainly be used by any user with a good grasp of computer basics."
1,Not for the serious!,"I found this book too sophmoric with few answers to tough questions. Nothing on scripting and few examples of anything but mundane projects. Of all the aftermarket resources I have purchases for high-end software, this is one of the worst. It should be retitled ""FM Pro for idiots""."
2,Very Disappointing,"I would'nt be here looking for other Filemaker manuals if I could recommend this one. Tedious, didactic and always fails to answer the question you're looking for."
4,A good re-telling of the Chicago disaster,"Cromie's book is a detailed account of the 1871 fire that destroyed much of Chicago (an even more devastating fire in terms of lives lost occurred on the very same day a few hundred miles north around Peshtigo, Wisconsin). He gives basically three reasons for the devastation: 1) the night before there was a major fire in the city that destroyed much property, knocked out fire-fighting equipment, and exhausted firefighters; 2) a relentless SW wind fanned the flames; and 3) Chicago was a city made of wood. Cromie relates quite a bit of the heroism that was displayed during the tragedy--also lots of bad behavior as well. A good historical account."
2,An interesting read - but very poorly formatted for Kindle,"Cromie's work is a nice and concise history of the 1871 fire in Chicago. While over 50 years old now, this book does not seem dated due to the straightforwardness of the language. The Kindle formatting, however takes this book from four stars down to two. The illustrations - which are key to the narrative - are almost useless in the Kindle format. My copy also had a page glitch that required me to jump through locations at one point in order to continue reading. If you are interested in the fire, I suggest purchasing the book."
1,Unable to read,"I purchased the book and began reading on my kindle. I got through 4% of the book and it wouldn't advance any farther. I contacted Kindle support and was told there was a problem with the download and they would contact the published and refunded my money, so obviously I wasn't able to read the book."
3,Started and it's just not all that.,I read great things about this book. I started reading it and am just disappointed so far. I'll update the review as I get further into it to update but so far the read is mediocre and the ideas presented are far from stellar things people just don't know...
5,Going crazy in the software development environment?,"I'm not going crazy, the software development environment is really like this. Jim gave me the ""rules"" and terminology to communicate the challenges of this profession to my managers. This book created a common bond among the software developers on my team to help us through our projects. A must read for every software project manager and the whole team. (Also give a copy to your manager)."
3,54 Interesting Rules,"McCarthy lays out a series of simple high-level thoughts about software development. Once you read each point, I would recommend that you take some time to flesh out each point and apply it to your particular development situation. Some ideas come with practical applications and some don't. Overall, a fairly good book that will get you thinking or re-thinking development."
5,Place on Your Team's Reference Shelf,"This book is a great book for development managers (those who manage software development projects)! Read it cover to cover and highlight the important summary paragraphs throughout the book for easy reference later.If you're a senior manager, then read it and get all of your development managers a copy for reference."
2,"Sorry, I just didn't find anything of any value here.","After reading Debugging the Software Development Process, I was very excited to read Dynamics of Software Development. I was very disappointed. I thought this book didn't offer much insight, but rather was attempting to be techno-hip, and cash in on its association with the many other fine MS Press related books. I almost didn't read Rapid Deveopment because of this!"
2,Not Quite...,"the read of McConnell's 'Software Project Survival Guide' or 'Rapid Development'. Its a hard read with vague areas as well as over the sky areas. I hate the stupid pictures, waste of at least 50 pages. Trying to find a subject is hard , all content is hiden in vagueries. Read McConnell first."
3,Me-too book!,"Yes, this book does have good ideas on each page as others have stated; however, many are neither unique nor original. I got more out of Levinson's books."
5,Complete nutritional support,"Good taste, filling and nutritionally complete for very reasonable caloric intake - excellent after a workout"
3,3M M1000 Should be better.,The two piece plastic blade is very flimsey and to easy to break. I had to replace it with the metel blade off of my old M3000 in order to make it worthy of daily use.
1,Don't buy it.Don't buy it.Don't buy it.Don't buy it.Don't buy it.,It is a total waste. Spend the extra bucks and buy the 3000 model. You really get what you pay for here or get Trimaco 5000
1,Don't buy it.,"This thing is garbage and only worked temporarily. Plain and simple. Poor construction led to the paper dispenser literally popping off somewhere into the jobsite never to be found. Quality Chinese construction.The blades aren't as bad I was made to believe however. Still nowhere near as good as the metal ones though. If you're going to buy a masker, buy the best you can afford. Me, I'm still using my pre 3m masker from over 20 years ago. That thing is a beast."
1,Ridiculous delivery time,"I ordered this item on August 22, and was told I can expect delivery by September 14! That is unacceptable service by any approved Amazon vendor! I tried to cancel but they shipped it anyway. I will buy this item locally before it is ever delivered."
1,Not uplifting when you know the final result - divorce,"I remembered reading this book back in the 80's and decided to find it again since I knew someone who might benefit from it. However, when I was researching it, I found out that Pat and Jill Williams actually divorced after the book was published. It kind of discounts the whole message of the book. Well, at least I don't want to give it to someone who is looking for answers and hope. Depressing..."
1,Sad testimony...No reccomendation!,"This book should be retitled: ""How To Persevere By A Man Who Gave Up""Pat is divorced and remarried to a self-made professional woman and is a succusseful ""Motivational"" speaker...This book leaves out the most important thing in saving a marriage, that is Jesus Christ. Read the Bible, not this book."
4,Good book for kids,This is a good book about san antonio activities for the family...by an author who writes great stories about the south texas area including some of the best ghost stories... so if you are looking for a good book for young and old read Docia Schultz Williams.
3,Not the greatest selection of tracks...,"There are two problems with this collection. First, Jeff's career is long and diverse. A lot of disc one is pretty dated stuff and, while it is certainly of historical interest, the guitar playing is not going to floor you. 2nd, the choice of tracks is highly questionable. Disc 3, which should highlight the dizzying heights of JB's amazing guitar playing in the 70s and 80s, instead contains far too much - 5 tracks! - from ""Flash,"" an abominable album Jeff was forced into making by his record company. So, while this is an interesting cross-section of Jeff's playing, it contains a lot of the bad with the good. You're better off getting the three CD pack of ""Blow by Blow,"" ""Wired"" and ""There and Back"" which Amazon sells as a specially priced ""threefer."" Then add ""Truth"" and a Yardbirds compilation and you've got an excellent early Jeff Beck collection, for about the same cost."
2,Key Word: Redundant,"A disappointing box set for several reasons. One, too much Yardbirds where those tracks have been represented elsewhere. Second, over half of the third disc is derived from later Jeff Beck albums, such as the unlistenable Flash. Third, far too little of his Group and solo work is representated. As an introduction to Jeff Beck, Beckology is adequate, but otherwise, too much of this is redundant."
4,"Not 4 stars, but not 5 either.","If I could give Beckology 4.5 stars, I would. However, I can't, so I'll give it 4.I got the Beckology CD, and popped disc one in my CD player. Ah, the Tridents. Then, the Yardbirds. Some great stuff! Jeff's tone is well represented in the Yardbird's songs, especially in the BBC performances (which were a nice touch to the CD). CD two is equally as good, and the unreleased Beck Bogert and Appice songs are very cool. CD three, however, isn't quite as good. CD three doesn't have enough stuff from the instrumental era (a.k.a. Blow by Blow, Wired, and There and Back) and has way too much from Flash. Flash being probably Jeff's worst album, it doesn't make sense to have 4 cuts from it, when albums like There and Back have only one cut. Guitar Shop has two good cuts, and the Twins songs Jeff did are a good touch. With some more stuff from BBB, Wired, and There and Back, then take out some of the bad Flash cuts, and this compliation set would be worthy of a five."
2,Book Review,"It was an intresting direction on the topic of homosexuality on the biblical debate. To compaire the different cultures that surrounded the Hebrew people. It just seem confuing at times, and some what repetative. I got bored with it."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I WAS ORDERING A CALENDAR AND THIS IS MORE LIKE A BOOKLET. I GAVE THEM AS GIFTS..I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT.
2,Mistaken premise leads to mistrust of international law.,"One of very few resources available on this important topic. Unfortunately the book begins with mistaken premises and moves on predictably to weak conclusions. The book begins with the premise that there was no valid international agreement on the UN Declaration of Human Rights, because the US Senate never ratified it. However, as a declaration rather than a treaty or convention it never required ratification, nor was the Senate ever asked to ratify it. It received the presidential signature which was all that was required. Book concludes with admonishment that students of human rights should not trust in international law at all, as adopted by and agreed to by the United Nations. Author offers a weak argument for supporting the right to education as a special case, however, in lieu of the solid basis in international law."
2,It broke after one month,"I bought three of these for the bedrooms and one of them broke in a month, after minimal use. The other two are okay, a bit noisy though. What a pain to have to return this!"
2,R.I.P. fan - 12/14/2008 - 5/17/2010,"For the amount they charge for this fan, I expect better longevity. Under a year and a half for regular usage? Not acceptable.Also, I paid 29.99 for this fan. It's currently on sale for 68 dollars, down from 129.99. Seriously? They must have raised the price quite a bit because I don't think I was getting that big a discount."
4,It works and is relatively quiet,"I just bought this fan today. I bought it because of the cool ""classic"" look it was going for and the floor model felt well-made and heavy. It is hot today in LA, and I have it full blast. It is not an air conditioner, but it does what it does relatively well without too much noise. [...], but the design of this thing looks solid."
5,Great Fan,I purchased this fan a few months ago. I love it. It's Made out of quality materials and works like a charm. I can see this fan lasting for many years.
4,Vintage Looking Fan.,"I bought this because of its vintage look but its a bit chinsey/cheap looking. The Hunter Rockefeller Portable Fan, Majestic Yellow with Brushed Nickel Trim is a much better item ~ if you like yellow."
2,NOT Quiet!,"Built to last? yes!Looks good? The best presentable fan I've ever had.Quiet? No.. NO... NO.. Not even when I'm 10 feet away and have it set to the lowest speed, it sounds like small cessana plane flying over at the distance.Fan blade wasn't exactly designed with air dynamics in mind. It's rather primitive in design. just flat metal with straight forward single bend. Believe me, fan blades have evolved in last two decades to run quieter and be effective at high velocity. (I guess they are keeping their 117 years tradition without incorporating new changes.)It looks damn good even when it's not running, I really wanted to keep it. but... pap! pap! pap! pap! pap! pap... that echos in my head. I had to look for something else. If I can't find Japanese made Sanyo, I'll probably get a bigger blade fan that runs at slower speed. It will be ugly but graceful sleep at night can't be trade off for anything else."
4,This fan blows,"a lot of air. It is so powerful that its lowest setting blows plenty of air. The drawback to this is that it's kind of noisy, which I expect is because it's all metal, as opposed to plastic, which most fans are made of. I don't mind the noise too much because it's a nice hum.It is also gorgeous, which is the main reason I got it. I have it sitting proudly in my living room, and it's like another piece decoration. Sometimes I move it to the dining room when it gets too hot in there, and I miss it in the living room.Besides the noise, which isn't a big deal, the only other drawback to this fan is the black cord. I think it would be much nicer with a clear cord, as there is no way for me to hide the cord, and there is no black anywhere in my living room.If aesthetics is just as important to you as function, I recommend spending the extra money on this fan."
2,"Noisy even at low speed, and leaves stains on varnished wood","The fan has eight black vinyl or rubber feet, and they have left black stains on an (expensive) varnished cherry wood furniture. Pretty much ruined the piece. It almost looks like a chemical reaction since the furniture surface is still good to the touch, but the marks are very visible. I think the plasticizer and carbon black in the vinyl feet has leached out. I contacted Hunter and they said the feet are designed to support the fan, and I should contact the furniture maker. Duh. Make sure you put a mat between the fan and good furniture.The fan is too noisy at its lowest speed and it could use a lower setting.Addendum: After serveral months of limited use the fan now creaks and squeaks while it is oscillating. It really is a poor quality, noisy fan."
1,"Yep, Whisper quiet since it doesn't work any longer!","Got this the week of Thanksgiving. It died today. Of course we had to endure months of noise coming off the fan and constantly adjusting it. I really am disgusted that a $60 fan won't even last ONE YEAR. Yes, it is attractive. Now it is a nice big retro paperweight.I will be seeking a replacement from the manufacturer after googling online I see that this happens to well over 50% of these. If your is quiet it is only a matter of time... and NINE MONTHS is NOT acceptable.****Hunter IMMEDIATELY sent out a replacement fan FREE of cost to me, which I received the week after Labor Day. It was the BEST customer service I have EVER had. HOWEVER, now it is December 18 and guess what?? The replacement fan is dying! Good God! Seriously! Ugh!"
5,My new Hunter Oscillatinf Fan,The fan is well worth the money. I purchased the brushed stainless steel finish and the fan is beautiful. The fan moves a lot of air.
2,Beauty is not everything,"I liked the retro look and the weight. It worked wonderfully for about a month and then it started getting louder. The oscillating really got loud -- so I used it in the stationary position. Now THAT is making noise. It got so bad last night, my husband, who cannot hear without hearing (and did not have them in) got up and turned it off. Another bad aspect is the extreme difficulty in cleaning this fan. I will never buy another fan that I cannot pop the front grate from easily. What a waste of good money!!"
5,It blows -- in a good way,"This fan is amazing. It is my favorite fan ever, in fact. It's heavy, it looks awesome, and it blows in a good way. A previous reviewer has commented on how, when on oscillating mode, it can ""click"" rather loudly -- and I noticed that mine does this sometimes as well -- but it is not annoying enough to return it for another one. Yet if it was that annoying, the point is that I *would* return it for another of the same fan, rather than look at a different brand or model.It's made in the USA, and if anyone reading this is as sick as I am with certain overseas products that were only meant to last a year, maybe two, this fan will technically pay for itself in a year, maybe two -- and keep on producing."
5,Hunter 90021 Century oscillating fan,"Purchased this fan for parents in their 70's. They wanted an all metal fan that wouldn't fall over. The fan's brushed nickel finish is very pleasing and blends well in any room. The motor runs very quiet. The 3 setting airflow is great. It's very powerful, and we usually run it on low. Not a cheap plastic fan. You will be pleased with this purchase. We've been running it daily for about a month now."
2,Not a powerful choice,"This fan is built very well - solid and heavy. However, it does not push much air even on high speed. I would have expected greater air flow from Hunter. Also the price was significantly more than the retail price at Target!"
1,Not Happy,In less than 30 days the occilation stopped.The company sent replacement but now I have to pay to ship back the broken one. Will I ever buy HUNTER again ?????????
2,Questionable quality,"I bought two of these together because I liked the look of them, we have no central air because we live in a relatively temperate climate, and the summer months are warm enough to need something to help make the house just a little more bearable. Less than a month later, of admittedly almost constant use, one of them died. Very disappointing. The other one still works just fine though. I'm not willing to spend this kind of money on a fan that might or might not work for very long. Not in this economy."
2,Unsatisfactory,"Similar to the experience another reviewer had with a Hunter fan (Hunter 90022 Century 12-Inch Performance Oscillating Fan), the one I bought quit oscillating and instead simply makes a clicking noise."
3,Hunter Desk Fan,"This fan was too strong for my small office. The low setting is like high on most other cheap fans. This fan could keep the air circulating in a large space. Plus, it's not exactly quiet, but, not bad for the amount of air it moves."
4,Breath-taking,"By National Geographic - that says it all! Great color, images, angles. It also goes into some details concerning the technical and historical side of scientific discoveries. Best of all, its not eurocentric. It's balanced and gives credit wherever it's due. It gives 2 whole pages to Meg Nath Saha. I take off 1 star because, for the price tag, the book should have more pages."
2,Crispy toilet paper!,"Well, it's ""green"" (recycled) -- But it's not soft! There is another version of this that I understand is sometimes available (and is what we buy in stores), and there are other ""green"" brands on offer here. The one benefit of this one is that each roll has a lot of sheets. But if you want something that feels more like ""American"" bathroom tissue, choose one of the other ""green"" versions to avoid disappointment."
4,7th Generation Bathroom Tissue,"I was surprised to find each tissue roll individually wrapped. I guess it is as pictured, but I had a different packaging image in mind that didn't waste so much paper packaging. It would be better if the rolls were packaged together instead of individually wrapped."
4,Received just in time and within expected range,"We were down to 2 rolls of Seventh Generation from a case ordered several years ago. Hence, very happy to see this arrival earlier than expected, though within the expected date range.In comparing the old with the new, the new is slightly narrower in width, although the sheet amount is the same. We cannot yet compare the durability because use has not yet occurred.Seventh Generation has changed ownership since we ordered last, and the new owner has cut some corners to increase profitability. Profitability for the new owner means higher costs for the consumer, especially when one adds in the high cost of freight. However, I have not shopped locally for this product because of a second fractured spine, so I'm thankful to be able to order this on Amazon. And, we were delighted that these arrived when they did.Seventh Generation Bathroom Tissue, 2-Ply Sheets, 500-Sheet Rolls (Pack of 48)"
4,Great toilet paper but,"I really like this toilet paper. A lot. It's strong and not flimsy, and it's super absorbent. It's also rather cushy without being thick and ""quilted,"" like that nasty, lint-assaulting, drain-clogging Charmin that feels like you're smearing lotion all over your lady bits, and is safe for septic systems. However I won't buy it here anymore unless Amazon starts selling it again. I purchased the 48-roll carton twice, and my last purchase was almost exactly a year ago. I came back to make a third purchase and was very disappointed to see that the new seller has priced it at almost triple Amazon's price. I recommend theMarcal Small Steps 100% Premium Recycled 2-Ply Embossed Toilet Tissue, 48 Rolls/Carton (6079)instead. It has only 336 sheets per roll, instead of 500, but I'll take the slightly smaller roll at $0.62 per unit instead of $2.20."
3,A Little Rough,"I bought this TP in an effort to be more environmentally friendly and I give kudos to the company for giving me the opportunity. However, I'm afraid I'm a little pampered when it comes to TP. This product feels basically the same as what you would find in a public restroom. It's acceptable, comparable to Scott tissue in general look/feel/texture. I find myself using a lot more than I do with my regular brand, which is thicker and softer. I'd say it's fine for number 1, but not so great for number 2. So I might keep some around for the bathroom I don't normally poo in :)"
2,Seventh Generation also offers a softer alternative,"Seventh Generation offers two types of bath tissue: 500 sheet and 400 sheet. The one listed above, at 500 sheets, is the thinner, tougher, more abrasive type. The one to get instead is the following, also available on Amazon (sometimes):Seventh Generation Bathroom Tissue, 2-ply White Unscented, Case Pack (48-400 Sheet Rolls)The 400 sheet variety is not only great for the environment (80% post consumer recycled/ whitened without chlorine bleach) but also soft and comfortable. Amazon currently lists it as 'unavailable'. To encourage Amazon to carry the more comfortable one, add that one to your wish list. Or once it is available, purchase the 400 sheet one instead.The 500 sheet variety will remind you of being in a gas station restroom. If you end up buying this in bulk, you'll find yourself secretly buying traditional toilet paper to pull out of the cabinet when you have guests..."
3,not what it used to be,"This is our second time ordering this bathroom Tissue. However, it is noticably different in softness. This time it is more like paper. I am going to contact Seventh Generation. Amazon is great with price and deliver. Beating all my green mags and websites."
4,Do your part!,"These are not super soft, but hardly sandpaper. Compares to Scott or the like. A respectable product that helps the earth. I keep a small package of the softer stuff on hand for when someone has a problem in the bathroom!"
5,"Good to Great product, decent price","The rolls were smaller than I expected them to be because it's just not as fluffy as premium brands of toilet, but it is certainly soft enough and far, far more comfortable than cheaper, generic brands. Given how we're punishing our planet, I'm pleased to buy something I don't have to feel ashamed about. Plus, it's a little less expensive than what I've found locally. (which makes me feel guilty about not buying locally) But it's something I'll definitely order again. (Even though the image the name of the product conjures up is a little disturbing.)"
4,not the softest but the environment is the highest priority,"This is my second time ordering this product. Certainly there are softer products on the market, but my highest priority is to preserve trees by purchasing recycled paper products."
4,"A little scratchy, but the environment is worth it!","OK- I really hate giving up my Charmin, but if this is better for the envoroment I will use it. I received it the other day and it was way better than I expected. It has a nice print in it, no wood looking pieces, but it is not very soft.(but softer than other brands I have used.) It does the job and I will continue to buy it because it is better for my septic tank and the environment."
1,Do not bother....,"Since it is environmentally friendly, I did not mind paying a bit more for this product than conventional toilet papers. I also anticipated difference in the quality since it is made of recycled paper. However, it is too rough for my family to use. It feels same as cheap toilet paper you use in the public bathrooms. I am also concened abouth plugging up the drain because it does not seem to disolving very well. I will not purchase this product again."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Well, I really wanted to like this paper and I paid the steep price of $10 for 12 rolls (on sale, mind you). But here is the deal. Even though the rolls have more sheets than Green Forest, I end up using more paper because this paper is: thinner, rougher and less absorbent. I don't think that I will be buying this again.Update: after using this for a while, I would say that I eventually got used to it and it doesn't feel rough anymore. But when I initially switched to it from the softer TP that's how it felt!"
2,like newspaper without the ink,"The TP is VERY THIN - how can they call this 2-ply? It's thinner than some other 1-ply.TP is stiff, not a bit of softness, I could use newspaper for free intead of buying this.This was not at all the bargain I thought this was. No one in my family wants to use this. 47 rolls will be donated to the YMCA."
2,Publix Supermarkets sell the same thing.,"If you live in the Southeast, Publix sells a 100% recycled toilet paper and it is the cheapest one you can buy in the store. The mark up on Seventh Generation is sometimes warranted, but not in this case."
2,Am I missing something here?,"I'd say 90% of the products I bring into our home are green so I finally tried this tissue, uh...Ow? I don't get it, why do so many people like this tissue? It's loud and crinkly, stiff and it hurts my kachanga! No thanks."
2,Not too good...,My family thought this paper was much too harsh and rigid. You actually end up using more to clean effectively. My family couldn't bare to use it anymore so I donated the rest of it!
2,Wow - the same as any public bathroom,"I have half a case left and had to finally break down and get good old Angel soft. I can truly say this is a real dissappointment. I thought being 2ply and having a soft side would mean it would be a little better than a public bathroom and be good for the planet too. WRONG! I never expected it to be plush or even close to Angel Soft but I thought it would be tolerable. I'll continue to use it of course-until it's gone for good. But every 2-3 rolls I just can't stand it anymore. There will be HUGE MONEY to be made for the first company who figures out how to make an earth friendly but soft toilet paper. Unfortunately, my favorite company for cleaning products has miserably failed in this area."
4,"Glad to help the environment, but...","the paper is not very soft. However, it's worth it to feel like you are making an environmentally conscientious choice."
5,I can't feel the difference,"Either I've lucked out or other people had just obtained mis-manufactured packages! I don't feel if this toilet paper feels any rougher. It feels perfectly fine to me. Happy with how the product is manufactured, I will continue buying it and other Seventh Generation products."
4,great toilet paper,"its not as soft as the expensive brands, but it is not terrible either. I have it set up on auto-send once every 3 months. For comparison, I'd say its better than the stuff in the BIG roles in public toilets, but its also not as soft as the expensive stuff."
4,nice,as advertised. no complaints. i will buy them again. i recommend them to you . you wont be disappointed. green for the earth is good
5,It works. What else can you say?,Great product that for anyone. This is no flimsy tissue that falls apart upon use and does not feel like sandpaper. As good as brand names that use virgin hardwood from old growth forests. And they are great for the the environment. These are great compared to brandnames which have regular rolls around 260 sheets or double rolls but are only 400 or 450 sheets. These are 500 sheets and comparable in price. I would recommend anyone give them a try.
5,Worth Every Penny in Every Way!,"I already use the Seventh Generation Baby Wipes and Diapers and I LOVE them so I thought I would try their toilet paper. First off, I'm not the type of person that needs a luxurious piece of paper to wipe their butt with. Some reviews specified that it was not soft, but I really didn't care if I could make a difference in the environment. Much to my surprise the toilet paper is WONDERFUL. It does the job and is environmentally friendly! You'll read on the packaging what a difference it would make if everyone in the US replaced just one roll of regular toilet paper with the Seventh Generation recycled paper and it is absolutely incredible. I feel great buying their products and the prices are great on Amazon.com. I just placed an order for their paper towels and kitchen trash bags. I'm sure I won't be disappointed...I haven't been yet!"
1,"Too rough for our ""bums"".","The idea is good by the quality is not. The paper is way to rough for our ""bums""."
2,The Paper Could Be Softer and Thicker,"I've enjoyed toilet paper made by Seventh Generation that I bought in smaller packs at the grocery store, so decided to get a case online for work. While it is good to have a roll with 500 sheets, somewhere along the way they lost the softness. The rolls that are individually wrapped and sold by the case do not feel as soft and are thinner than the store bought ones. I would have to use an extra square to make sure, so to speak, which used up more paper.The people who work here noticed the difference, as well, and so I won't be buying cases of this again. I ended up finding a similar product (a case of 500-sheet rolls) by a different company that was much softer and had the same Post Consumer Recycled Paper content as Seventh Gen., so I have switched. Too bad it is not sold on Amazon :( (hint, hint... find other enviro toilet paper products to sell, guys!)"
3,Disappointed,"I usually love this order. A huge box arrives and I can stock all the bathrooms and forget about it for a few months. This time the toilet paper was a lesser quality. The 2 ply keeps splitting and we are wasting toilet paper trying to resolve it or having the 1 ply which we didn't pay for. The order is disappointing and I'll only give it one more try - as it's so many rolls it takes a long time to go through it. The delivery time, shipping, packaging, and amount is great!"
3,Great product but price increases are out of control,"Seventh Generation bathroom tissue is a great environmentally friendly alternative to traditional (non recycled content) bathroom tissue. It's relatively soft, and a case lasts a long time. However, it's becoming cost prohibitive given the current state of the economy; it's $1 or more a roll. Recyclable fiber is abundant, and its price is historically low. Nonetheless Seventh Generation continues to increase its price."
4,Perineal Care,Stuff costs more than normal TP but its socially conscious (hopefully). Great bargain when buying through Amazon.
2,Need to refinish your floors? This might be too rough even for that job!,"I really like the idea of this toilet paper... less environmental waste, though I agree with other reviewers that using a bidet is preferable from an environmental perspective. I used Scott 1000 sheet single ply in college and this stuff makes that feel like Charmin. Literally, every guest in our home who has used this has teased us about this incredibly rough toilet paper. Another reviewer branded it ""interstate rest area toilet paper"" and I completely agree.The only thing this paper has going for it is that it is environmentally friendly...but gone are the days where we must sacrifice function for lower impact (for example, Ecover Dishwasher tablets are actually better performing than their less environmentally-friendly counterparts).Do yourself, your family and your guests a favor and keep looking for a better alternative."
5,"Excellent tissue, but this is WAY overpriced",And we thought it was expensive at Central Market! Do yourself a favor and check your local store. We paid 9 usd for 12 rolls which works out to 36 for 48 rolls. Guess this is how Amazon keeps the prices on other items down ;)
1,Marcal's is better and cheaper,"I'm not sure what changed, but the price went up and they started shipping the TP wrapped in plastic. I was looking at reviews and I happened upon someone mentioningMarcal Small Steps 100% Premium Recycled 2-Ply Embossed Toilet Tissue, 48 Rolls/Carton (6079). I took a chance and glad I did. It's 1/3 of the price and the toilet paper is much better, more substantial and softer. Just figured I share my experience."
3,Not what is pictured!,"The rolls that I received are not what is pictured. Apparently 7th Generation has downsized this toilet paper as well. The product in the photo is 58.5 square feet and the product I received is 52.6 square feet. Each sheet went from being 4.5"" x 3.75"" to 4.1"" x 3.7"". I also received a receipt in my shipment from Vitacost and it showed the product costing $40 less than what I paid for it! Either I paid $40 for shipping or someone is making a heck of a commission."
4,Great value - Great for environment - less soft,"This bath tissue is a lot less soft than the other brands that are not recycled but if you're like me and put social and environmental responsibility above that point, you'll be happy. If you need double quilting and such, you wont. 100% recycled. Comes in a huge box with individually wrapped rolls which I feel is a little counter productive for the whole environmental thing - wish they could figure that one out."
2,"not a great product, doesn't absorb well, ok softness","I'm a big fan of Seventh Generation cleaning and laundry products mainly for the health benefits, though it doesn't hurt that they also claim to be sustainable.Reading the other reviews about the lack of absorption and roughness made me hesitate, but ultimately I decided to give it a try.I would describe the softness as average. It's definitely not like a Charmin Ultra Soft roll, but more like the Charmin Ultra Strong roll. Softness wasn't a problem for me.The main problem is that it's weak and not that absorbent so I end up having to use 3-4 times more paper than usual and it's still not as good as the Ultra Soft roll. It's not as bad as gas station bathroom TP as someone else described, but it's not a premium product either.Get it if you like that it's from recycled material, but functionally I'll order a more absorbent and stronger paper next time.Summary: average product, breaks easily, poor absorption"
2,Yucky toilet paper,"We have a big, old Whole Foods here in town, that for some reason only carries this brand (Seventh Generation) but not the other brand of ""green"" toilet paper that we like. I've bought these a couple of times and regretted it on each occasion. This brand is both flimsy and rough, and the rolls are packed extremely loosely -- you're not getting a lot of paper for your money. I'd use this paper in a pinch (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) but I have often gone out of my way to avoid buying it."
1,Wasteful,"I bought these hoping they would be a decent product (like so many of the other seventh generation products) that could help cut down on our wasteful use of toilet paper. My daughter and I dubbed this, ""self-destructing toilet paper"" because it weakens the moment it touches anything wet. It is thin, dissolves a little too quickly and is harsher than the most cheaply made toilet paper I've ever used (think early elementary public school bathrooms). Its more expensive and you need to use more just to get the job done. I love green products, but I won't sacrifice quality ALL the time in order to get it. I will keep using other seventh generation products (and method, etc.) but there's no use in buying something if it doesn't work. Sadly, back to Charmin unless someone else finds a way to make somewhat soft and a bit thicker ""green"" toilet paper."
1,hey,this is the worst toilet paper ever it makes your BUTBLEED TRUDT ME IM AN EXPERT IN TOILET PAPER IF YOU WANT YOUR BUT BLEEDING BUY IT HAVE FUN.
3,Environmentally friendly - Bottom unfriendly,This is really abrasive - 1 points for softness - 5 points for trying to save the environment. Reasonable price. Won't buy it again.
5,Great Bathroom Tissue,My family has tried several different brands of 100% recycled bathroom tissue and Seventh Generation is the best in terms of quality and value. Purchasing by the pack of 48 rolls means not having to worry about running out.
5,This is the best of the bunch!,I don't find this paper to abrasive at all! What I love about it is the fact that one roll lasts more than a day in my household of 3. I also love the fact that it's NOT cottony soft and falling about during use. I also love the individually wrapped rolls. This keeps the rolls neat and dust-free while stored under my sink. No more big bulky plastic covered packages that have to creatively stored once busted open! This is by far THE BEST price on the 48 ct. 500 roll product I've seen. Thanks AMAZON for carrying this! The speedy shipping is ALWAYS appreciated!
2,Not the soft 7th Generation from the 12-pack,"This is definitely NOT the same wonderfully soft TP you get in the 12-pack with 352-sheet rolls. I found that out the hard way, and because of it won't be ordering it again. I wish there was an option get the same same, softer rolls in bulk here on Amazon as I love ordering a large quantity and having it show up on my doorstep.Until then, it's back to the store for me.I'd say, before you order 48 of these, try a single roll of the 500-sheet version (that's important as the 400-sheet and 352-sheet options are the softer varieties) to make sure you really want a mass supply."
4,"Good, but not Softest!!","This is not as soft as Charmin, however this is better for the environment!! I do not mind using it as our everyday toilet paper. It does the job without falling to pieces or being irritating!!"
2,Good for the environment BAD for your backside..,"well I am torn when i write this review. I actually LOVE the brand and what it stands for. Environmental responsibility is very important to me as a consumer and individual.So I am a loyal customer of this brand. However to give both the good and the bad.Hands down this brand passes the environmentally responsible test so for that I give it 5 stars, however because it's actually pretty rough toilet paper, it definitely is a little harsh on your backside.So it depends on your objectives as a consumer, do you want to buy the softest most gentlest toilet paper? Or do you want to help the environment?I chose the latter. So loyal customer but raw backside."
3,Example of ecofriendly - customer unfriendly,"Reminds me of sand paper. I have since switched to this oneSeventh Generation Bathroom Tissue, 2-ply, 300 Sheets, 12-Count (Pack of 4).Too thin and have a to use a lot of sheets to get the job done and stay hygenic."
2,If you have an iPod Dock - DONT BUY IT,"The cover is pretty good, except for the lint-attraction quality of the window, making it really difficult to see the display unless backlighting is on. Otherwise, if you have an iPod dock - DO NOT BUY THIS. The cover makes the overall form too big to slip into the dock. Also, if you try to just plug in the cord directly, the port opening is cut so tightly that the plug can't seat all the way. SO, you have to take off the cover (not designed for that, and relatively annoying to do), just to charge and synch.On second thought -- don't buy one."
1,It is a no no,"I agree with everything said previously. Horrible case, unpleasant touch, unreadable display..."
4,Well done in so many ways,Good material presented in various formats makes this a must buy for a Yosemite visitor.
2,stinks!,"I bought this to take odors out of my hair but it smells so bad itself, I think I'd prefer odors! It may actually work well I am not sure but the item itself smells bad. I also paid more for shipping than for the item."
2,Odorous neutralizer,"Product arrived promptly and as promised; however, I found the product has an unpleasant odor when sprayed. Frankly, it doesn't neutralize odor so much as cover it up with something worse."
2,Underwhelming,Only three models in the short video. Three D effect doesn't seem natural. Too much attention to fussy Russian models thoughts.
3,purchased for 3D content,"When all you are looking for is content for your new 3D TV, pretty women in swim suits seems a reasonable way to fill the screen."
4,"For the price, worthwhile for 3D",Not the best 3D effects and bought for the scenes of Maui (ok the models were nice too!) which were ok in 3D but compared to the Grand Canyon and others not quite as dramatic. Bit too much dialog for my taste and a lot of repetition but was able to get this at a low price so worth it for what I paid.
2,broken and loud,fist off when i got this one of the items where broken so i didnt get to use it i thought the beeds where really small i mean i could make somthing bigger at home small and the vibrators where powerful but kind of loud to me but all in all i think i would have keept it if it wasnt broken
3,Good looks...,"This is a very good looking case, BUT too tight for the iPod 2nd generation, to which it is intended to fit. It took forever to get my iPod in and when I used it... it was going coock coock... showing other artworks for my songs... think there was too much presure that made mu iPod work wrong. Maybe it was only mine but it is a pity I cannot use it. Good luck!"
2,Great Product...If it Fit!,"I was so impressed with the feel and quality of this cover...until I slid my 2nd Gen iPod in it. My iPod promptly slid right back out! The opening is at the bottom so if I were to clip this on my belt, my iPod would slip right out and land on the ground. I'm very disappointed because it seems like a great case."
5,A great guide for new and old ABAPers,"A great guide to ABAP development for the range of ABAP experienced people. For those new to the SAP development world it is very comprehensive, for those already emeshed in the SAP world there are many gems of wisdom to be found"
2,Introduction to ABAP/4 Programming Language,"The book is basically an introduction one only for people with a little bit experiences. It covers elementary information about ABAP/4, GUIs, screens, and functions. The authors try to address the issues about ABAP/4 and SAP as good as possible. But they fail to do that. Many of its information in the book may subject to making confusion to new SAP programmers. Some descriptions are repetitive about theory and programming importance but does not focus on details and give major examples. Overall, the book is so good as it declares it is an immediate and advanced book for experience professionals. For people who are already familiar with ABAP/4 and SAP, it is actually useless."
2,Book for beginners,This book is nothing but introduction to ABAP/4 prog. It does not go into details of it. I would recommend this book only for the beginners and not for experts. Amit
3,Good introduction,"If you don't want to be an ABAP expert, but still want to write simple programs and reports, this is the book for you.No prior knowledge required!"
1,One of the worst I've ever read.,"After three years of ABAP consulting I don't know why I haven't burned this book. I got it in an official SAP training class, and it was written by two of the company's software engineers, but it is one of the worst examples of software writing I have ever seen. Many of the keywords of the language are not even in the index, and most of the subject matter is covered only in broad strokes, meaning that the book does not tell you how to do much of what is really available in the language, not even point out that anything else might exist. It was only by reading existing code and trying to use this book to find out what it meant that I came to realize how inadequate it is."
1,Not even for beginners I would recommend it.,"4 times I needed to check or find something, 4 times it didn't help me. And if you want to learn abap....take a course. This is a bible without the New and the Old testament, but just an incomplete table of contents."
4,This book is a must for a beginner !,"If you are just starting out with ABAP/4 Programming, you need this book. Sure this book won't cover hundreds of details on one topic, but it gives you a strong foundation for learning basic to intermediate level before moving onto an advanced level book."
5,MOST beneficial of ALL,"When those where I work struggled with learning specific techniques, various on site books on SAP and ABAP were checked. This book, owned by our SAP contractor, was loaned to us. We agree with the contractor, who said it is by far the best book on SAP's R/3 Applications with ABAP. Book is out of print, but we prefer it (regardless of the older version) over all the others we have. We're buying two more copies because our SAP contractor wants his back. (This book is FAR TOO VALUABLE not to be updated with new version info and put back into print)"
4,Great system for those interested in cabinetry,"I am new to cabinet making. This book offers a very simple system for construction of carcases and door frames.It does not, however, provide insight into cabinetry design."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I recently moved to a new home with very high counters and special ordered 32"" bar stools. When they finally arrived, I was so excited because I needed them for Thanksgiving. My excitement ended as soon as I looked at the outside of the box, which indicated that they were indeed 30"" stools. We opened them and they were indeed 30"" stools, with some padding on the seats. I emailed the company with this issue and they said that this in how stools are measured (even thought the box clearly stated that they stools were only 30' tall) and that I shoould feel free to send them back...at my cost...and, that if I did, they woould charge me an extra 're-stocking' fee. I inquired if they made 34"" stools (since I needed 32"" !) and never even receive4d a response from the company.I have ordered from Amazon for many, many years and this is the very first time I have run into any problems. I am extremely disappointed."
5,Great for Travel,This is a natural product and works well. It is a solid crystal so it you do not have to worry about any leakage in your travel bag. It is a no mess solution for home too. It lasts for a very long time just wet the crystal and rub on. It is scent free and leaves you order free. And the price is very inexpensive comparing to other deodorant solutions. I have found Crystal products to be just what they advertise. And trust me deodorant is a priority.
5,Great travel size,"When I started the HCG diet I bought a Thai Deodorant Stone from Amazon. It works well but I wanted something smaller for travel and the travel size Crystal Body Deodorant fit my needs. Isn't a liquid or cream so it can be packed in a carry-on. These deodorants last for years and eliminate the expense of replacing roll-ons, sprays another other types of deodorants that don't do as good a job."
5,The best online reference for new or seasoned researchers,I've been researching online since 1994 and I found something that I didn't know on almost every page of this book. It is informative enough to keep a seasoned researcher entertained but simple to use for a first time web searcher.I may have to have my copy hard bound somewhere to keep it from falling apart through overuse.
3,"Simple and quick information, very helpful","A simple and quick guide to exploring items on the internet. Helpful for very specific topics. Global issues, true research items and expansive topics, while somewhat covered, still leave you wondering whether there might be other sites out there. A first time surfer should buy this book. Experienced surfers don't need it."
4,Well built piece of equipment,"I have to agree with the other reviewers, this is a well-built piece of equipment that makes my old plastic hose cart look like cheap garbage."
5,Rapid Reel GH 164-CT-B Garden Hose Reel,This product is made in the USA and is of very sound construction. It is very easy to assemble and performs its function very well. I am considering buying another one for use in another location on my property.
5,wrong to lust after hose reel?,I saw this reel at a local garden center and immediately fell in love. They wanted over full retail so I ordered it from Amazon. along with hoses. I ordered the larger model which holds 200' of hose. The holes were not lining up and it took me about 45 minutes to get it together but it is wonderful.
5,Cheap but very good!,"Yes these pencils are cheap, or inexpensive, but the quality is much better than I expected. The grip is very comfortable and the pencils are strong. They come with leads and even extra erasers. What else can you ask for?"
3,Buy A Used Copy!,"Not really something to go out and buy>try to find used first.CD lacks depth and emotion; has Rick only going through the motions if you will.I really don't think blues is the man's forte.Positives include Somebody Loan Me A Dime, Just a lil bit and All your love I miss loving."
5,Excellent tele-macro lens,"This is a superb lens, with a good solid build and a smooth manual focus. Because it's made from polycarbonate rather than metal, it's also surprisingly lightweight. The tripod collar is easy to remove but solid. The filter effect control is a nice convenience.The automatic focus is not particularly fast, but this is not much of a disadvantage since most photographers use manual focus in macro work anyway.Highly recommended."
4,Tamron 180mm macro review,"Sharp, easy to focus, allows closeups from a significant distance.Heavy, requiring a tripod for most exposures.Instructions could be better written."
3,Painfully slow autofocus,"This is my first non-Nikon lens and I'm sorry I bought it. While the lens is OK, the focus mechanism is incredibly, painfully, agonizingly slow. The focus mechanism must make three full revolutions to go from closeup to infinity, stopping and stuttering all the way, and passing the focus point until you attempt a second squeeze at the focus. I'm shooting with a Nikon D700 body and I'm accustomed to near instant focus with the high end Nikon lenses. I needed a longer Macro lens to go along with my 105, and the Nikon 200 was not available at the time I bought it. It was also listed as quite pricey in the wake of the Japan Earthquake. I gave the lens 3 stars because the image quality is decent, but it would have been a 4 star had the focusing mechanism been screwed down more tightly so that three rotations were not necessary to go from closeup to infinity."
5,Fun and relaxing!,We read this book almost every night. I know it by heart and there are times I will tell it to the kids after the lights are out to get them settled down. Beautiful illustrations. We like to compare the morning picture and the evening picture to find all the animals. A must have for the reading family!
5,Great for Bedtime - or anytime,"My 2 year son loves this book. I often read it many times before bed. For me, it is the illustrations that make it so captivating. The colors are soft and pictures vivid. I love the different viewpoints of the farm. My son finds something new to point out each time we read it."
5,A DELIGHTFULLY GOOD READ!,"AS A BEDTIME STORY, THIS CAN'T BE BEAT! MY GRAND DAUGHTER SAID WHEN SHE SAW ME PICKING OUT THIS BOOK...""NOT THAT ONE, GRANDMA,...I LIKE THE STORY BUT IT ALWAYS MAKES ME SLEEPY."""
1,"DOA, no support from DeLonghi","My unit was DOA. There was no cooling, only the fan. I received no help whatsoever from my seller (I did NOT order through Amazon, please note, so don't blame them) or, most particularly, from DeLonghi. I have never dealt with a more customer un-friendly company. There was absolutely no attempt to take responsibility, to offer to effect repairs, or even to mediate with the seller. If anything goes wrong, don't expect DeLonghi to help. You are on your own."
1,This unit is a complete waste of money,"This unit is very large, very heavy, very expensive, and does a very poor job at cooling. I put this unit in a 375ft room with low ceilings, and while it does a marginally fine job on marginal days (~85F outside), when the temperature climbs toward/above 90, it is useless. My 5,000 BTU window unit purchased for $150 produces far more cooling than this unit."
4,Nice portable A/C,"The first unit I received was dented, parts missing. It looked like they sent me something that they picked up from the garbage. They redeemed themselves by sending me a new one in 2 days and picked up the first one they sent me the next day. The unit cools the room pretty good with the help of a 10,000 btu wall mounted unit. I have both A/C running at the same time and it keeps my apt (600sq ft) about 70 degrees. One good feature about the PAC-260 is that it comes with a door adapter which can be used on large sliding windows which are over 5 ft. tall. No other portable A/C unit has a adapter that fits large windows. The only bad thing about the unit is the second A/C they sent me had a small dent on the front panel, but I think the unit is too heavy to be shipped by they shipping company they use and should be packaged better. Overall I'm happy wiht the unit."
1,Doesn't survive shipping,I ordered this unit over two weeks ago. The first unit arrived with multiple dents and a poorly mounted front panel. The second unit didn't even make it to delivery. The shipper returned the unit as damaged without attempting to deliver it to me. My impression is that the unit is too fragile for the packing method being used. I'm not waiting through another round.
2,Did not live up to expectations,"I owned the PAC290 for 8 years. It cooled my 10x10 room in under 30 minutes, and gave me 25-35% humidity releif. I was told since I never used the water in the PAC290, this machine would actually perform better, not. Seven machines later I get 10 degrees cooling relief and 5% Humidty releif, also the air cleaner filterdoes not filter out the allergens or dust. Not the same machine that the PAC290 was. make sure if get one ship via a motor freight truck not UPS as they damage easily. I would love to share experices with this machine with the other reviewers. I am currious what kind of temperature and humidity result you got, as well as how well the air cleaner filter worked for you. Bottom line. think hard before buying this machine."
2,Buy a tube of silicone,"I try not to get my expectations set too high when it comes to cheap switches. It is expected that a doorbell switch will fail after long exposure to the elements. Most are inexpensive, one replaces them and moves on, but to make a $40 doorbell replacement is a hard sell. I have replaced a number of these items. In the majority of cases the cheap little button switch is the cause of the failure, but the whole assembly needs be replaced.Use some clear silicone caulk after connecting,(AND testing), the assembly to seal the rear of the switch, and to seal the housing to the wall. It will not stop the button from failing, but will extend the life of it."
2,Nutone Outdoor Station,"I have a Nutone system (IM 3303) in my house. This particular purchase was a replacement for and orginal outdoor station. If I had to do it over and knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased a Nutone product. The system is 5 years old and I have replaced the initial home system along with 4/8 remote stations. Nutone uses (in my opinion) cheap components. Bascially the buttons and contacts (internal) break and or wear out. This particular outdoor station uses a cheap button for ringing the doorbell. They should do relability tests at Nutone and build something that will last."
3,Nutone Outdoor Station,"I agree with other reviewers regarding the pushbutton - it is not rugged enough to withstand long-term use. The speakerphone part of the unit is fine (mine is going on 18 years), but I've had to replace four or five pushbuttons in that length of time. Though not terribly expensive to replace, the pushbutton is this product's weakest link, and is definitely out of place on this $40 product. I gladly would pay a little more to be able to buy a more durable U.S. built, i.e. non-Chinese pushbutton, but it appears U.S. corporations are too busy maximizing their profit margins to provide robust products for American consumers' dollars."
1,Horrible workmanship.,"Craftsmanship on my sword was horrible. I purchased it as a gift for a good friend and fellow LOTR fan. Had to send it back, as it was of extremely poor quality."
1,Vigo Faucet,"I purchased this vigo chrome pull-out faucet over the internet, had it installed and it worked perfectly for one day, then it started leaking around the push button on the pull out and around the bottom of the faucet where you don't have an even stream of water. The faucet looks great installed, but I am very disappointed that it doesn't work right. I've got to get it fixed or replaced and it's only been installed for 3 days."
1,toxic,This phone is toxic. Affixed to the cord is a label that says that the cord of this telephone is toxic and can cause reproductive harm so wash your hands after each use. I don't know about you but what kid is going to wash her or his hands after each use of a phone conversation or even just handling the cord? The manufacturer of this product should just pay the extra and put on a safe material.
1,Ok I AM AN ERITREAN,The book was nice enough but was not a true representative of Eritrean cooking I bought the book because I admire how the author felt a love for my country.Bless you
3,Respirator,I found out I had allergies and asthma after cleaning out my chicken coop so my husband got me this to wear when I mucked. It's very heavy and condensation gathers inside. It did however filter the air VERY well! I think if I would have gotten a smaller one I would have been more pleased.
5,"Finally, I have it!","I have been trying to get my hands on 'Faster Gun' for years. I bought a cassette tape once but wore out the song on the way home from the store, because I kept rewinding and rewinding. I am delighted to have the whole CD and enjoy the whole thing....I guess I should have tried listening to the whole tape back then....'Faster Gun' is a great Cowboy Boogie line dance song."
5,Good Pagan imagery and mystery from a real-life Pagan Author,"I loved this book, and I had no idea that Mary Sharratt was a member of my faith-community- over on Livejournal, she's known as Hagazusa, and is the owner of the ""Heathen_Goddess"" forum, and a well known Witch and Pagan from the U.K., even though she's originally from the States. The smooth adventure and layered mystery of this book- and the subtle presence of the Green Man imagery is no longer any mystery to me. I loved the characters (it made me think of Practical Magic, where Jimmy says his very understandable line ""I'm feeling very into sisters right now..."") and I did like the ending, even if I thought it might have been a bit long coming. But I'm a author myself, with a talent for length, so I can't complain. Way to go, Mary! It is so very refreshing to see modern Pagans succeeding at their dreams- and becoming successful authors. We're out of the broom closet now!"
3,The Vanishing Point,"I enjoyed this book for its setting, and slight mystery. As the novel progressed I became more disenchanted with it. The characters of the two sisters are so different, it never seems convincing that they would be so close. Though the book started out promising enough, and the mystery of May's demise kept me interested- I was rather disappointed in the ending chapters. I don't want to give away the plot, but it seems like some of the most exciting bits of Hannah's life (traveling as a boy) are left out."
1,Vanishing Point,This book was recommended for teens which I am shocked at. I read the book before giving it to my granddaughter. She was not given the book because of the content. I read it and it is slow and has passages for a someone who is a whole lot older.It also should be marked with an R rating.
5,Loved it!,Couldn't put this down. Would read more from this author anyday!!! She really did her research on all the herbs/medicines. Wow.
2,"Not my cup of tea, but readable.","Historical fiction is my absolute favorite genre, and after finishing my last book I decided to check out some new finds which were recommended on Amazon. The Vanishing Point has potential, and I think the author writes well - keeping it descriptive and interesting - but the overall flow of the story just doesn't work as well as one would hope.I think the basics of the story are a bit simplistic and honestly the story itself is incredibly depressing. Without giving away details, like I said - readable, not my cup of tea. Definitely something I would have rather gotten from the library... if I had even wanted to get it (knowing what I know now). Not memorable."
4,Women LIVE in Vanishing Point,"Vanishing Point is outstanding. May and Hannah are both such endearing characters and their devotion to each other is believable despite their completely different personalities and values. Gabriel also captured my heart--thus building the tension as the plot led me to and fro on his guilt/innocence. The setting, the wilderness as well as England all became part of my understanding of the early years for European/American women. The language pleases me, I felt the dialogue was real, and I loved the economy and grace with which people spoke in that era shines though. Vanishing Point is on my shelf of ""read again"" books. Kathleen Vellenga"
3,The Vanishing Point,"A good read for a bad weather day or a sunny ""pampering me"" day. Kept me entertained and interested. Just a good read for those that like a good story."
3,Wow.,"This book was very depressing. I felt the characters were very lifelike; I just didn't fall in love with any of them. It was definitely an interesting story with a twisted plot. I liked the set up and style it was written in, jumping back and forth between the characters and from past to present. The biggest disappointment was that it never really went anywhere and the mood was melancholy throughout."
3,New Flava???,"I just wanted to say that this CD has a lot of flava,but lacks a real producer. Cuzjed sounds like he's raw, hungry and wants more. The lack of a producer or should I say a ""good"" producer hurts. Purchase the CD but, listen and feel the lyrics."
2,Copper Birdbath,Beautiful design and solid copper. I loved it but it is not the right depth for a birdbath so returned it.
2,upside down,"I received this birdbath as a gift and its assembled upside down from the illustration so the small portion is the bath section. Also there is a small hole drilled in the bottom so it won't hold water. I guess I can plug the hole, but it doesn't make sense. Whats the deal? Did I receive the wrong product?"
2,Strange anthology sequel to Smokestack Lightening,"I got the other sony special music product cd from 91' Smokestack Lightening. That's pretty good. This is a very strange follow up to that. I'm surprised they load so much of the 63' live with Sonny Boy Williamson album. That music is O.K. but not really the Yardbirds or what they're about (they are a medioce backing band for a mediocre blues act at the time) The backing traks without vocals are pointless. The rare early live crawdaddy club performances and some of the other alternate takes are very good but only make this worth having if you have the other two CD set. However, it's a bit shocking that there's nothing from the Page led 'Little Games' album which is a great record. They mention it in the liner notes FOR GOODNESS SAKE! If they left off some of the Sonny Boy tracks and the backtracks they could've added a lot more good material. The Yardbirds recorded quite a lot of stuff that never made it to albums."
2,A Sloppy Overview of a Great Group,"This 2 CD set of Yardbirds odds and sods was rendered superfluous by Rhino's release of ULTIMATE. A few interesting inclusions help, like the sitar version of ""Heart Full of Soul"" and a few outtakes from the sessions that would result in ROGER THE ENGINEER, but otherwise this is a mess. ""Shapes of Things"" and ""Stroll On"" are also here, but they're also available on ULTIMATE. Worse, several tracks are repeated from Sony's earlier SMOKESTACK LIGHTING (again rendered superfluous by ULTIMATE). Sony clearly didn't care much about the band, one already notorious in collectors circles for its confused catelogue. To top it off, Bruce Eder's liner notes are dull and uninformative and chockfull of middlebrow disdain for his subject. Not to be too much of a pedant, a photo featuring Paul Samwell-Smith is mistakenly listed as being from ""Blow Up."" Skip it unless you're desperate to hear ""Pounds and Stomps"" or ""For RSG."""
2,Blues Backtracks Shapes,"I purchased this 2CD set sold it after a week. Not much original 'good' YardbiRds recordings here. Try Roger The Engineer, or better, locate some good original 45's on Epic vinyl. Blues and Backtracks' is an 'almost-there' 2CD set. It could have and should have been a lot better.If you find the original vinyl, many are in Stereo, and you can check out the dual lead guitar solos by Jeff Beck with Jimmy Page. The webpage says out of stock, I agree, don't buy it unless you collect cover-art. The tracks are stale, same-ol, same-ol' vinyl 45s and LPs seem much better and original. aa"
1,"Can someone add a ""0"" star rating please????","This book was really bad... And just to let you know, I can handle a really bad book if it has some really good [provacative] scenes to compensate. But that just didn't happen here. The [provacative] scenes had no excitement to them at all; I'm mean just plain boring. Andre was a typical man and Teo was just plain stupid. She was {if I'm not mistake; it's been a while since I've read the book.} 28-years-old but she acted like she was all of 13 with a really big crush on the local school boy. She is not at all the type of character I could be proud of. The author portrays her has weak and with very little common sense. This was my second book by this author and so far she has not impressed me at all. The first book I read by her was just ok and I was hoping she would get better with this novel but it didn't work out that way. I've had enough of this author."
2,What a boring sexual cliche!,"This book went from bad to worse. It was so loaded with trite sexual scenes, it became BORING! I put the book down 1/3 of the way through, and it is still sitting there. I like some plot in my books, thank you."
1,BORING!,"A romance novel with FOOTNOTES!?! Need I say more? This book trudges through the sheet-soiling exploits of two cardboard characters as they romp their way through one of the bloodiest wars of all time. I never cared about these characters and I already knew how the war turned out. Incest, rape, bigamy and adultery are NOT romantic. This book was a very dissapointing waste of time."
1,too tedious.,I could not get past chapter 1.sigh. I was so looking forward to finding out if this author was truly good; as I've heard. I guess I'm not that desperate to learn. Too much to take in at once.
1,Blah Blah Blah,"Come on how can two people meet, have sex and fall madly in love in two days in 1799??? She in one paragraph states her faithfulness to her husband and in the next is having sex with Andre and asking him to give her a child! Don't bother buying this book."
2,Not as spicy as the rest,"I enjoyed the erotic writing(what there was of it), but the battle scenes were too much. There were a couple pages that I turned because it was boring. I couldn't wait for Teo and Andre to get back to each other to spice it up a bit. I guess if you want to buy a book to read about the war and all the details this is a good one. Personally I bought it because of the previous books in the series (Sinful and Wicked) Now these were scrumptious. I thought this would be just as spicy."
2,"tedious ""Taboo""","The historical facts were interesting, but like most reviewers have said, it seemed as if Teo and Andre were more in lust than in love. The numberous sex sences flat out ruined the ""romance"" aspect of the story for me.Teo's character was not really flushed out. The back of the book says she was ""forced to marry the brutal Russian General who enslaved her people"", but you never know more about her life before Khorsakov entered it. What was her life like before her people were conquered? What made Khorsakov so cruel? He was nothing more than a stock character-one with the word ""villain"" printed on his forhead. Rather than a villian I'd love to hate, Korsakov is just thrown in so readers can say: Gee, what a meany he is!"" and why did it take so long for Andre to confront him? He might as well have been killed sooner. that seemed to be the main function of his character anyway.I adored ""Blaze"" though, so there is still hope I may read more of Susan's books again!"
2,Flat and forgettable,"I expect SJ to come up with exciting and erotic sex scenes in her books. Frankly, that's the key reason to read her books in the first place. But really, those scenes in this book are too plain and forgettable. And the story? Quite a yawn. All in all, a flat and forgettable book."
4,"Hot Water Music puts an incredible spin on ""Radio""","Some people say that HWM has ""lost it"" since signing to Epitaph, but I don't believe it. It's a great cover. And the Alkaline Trio just sounds like they always have and hey you can't really complain about that. Pick this up, if only for HWM's cover, though. That alone is worth it."
4,Down The Middle,"""Queen of Pain"" and ""While You're Waiting"" are two of the most unique original songs in Alkaline Trio's catalog; some of Matt Skiba's best songwriting yet. Powerful lines like, ""...I'm not much of a jester but I'd test poison food for you..."" and ""...you told me once I made you smile/we both know damn well I didn't..."" make ""Queen Of Pain"" my album favorite. The Trio's take on HWM's ""Rooftops"" is excellent...I have yet to hear the original, but I doubt it could be better. Hot Water Music's ""Russian Roulette"" is a song that starts out sounding all pukey and gross, but quickly builds into the perfect song to relax to. An entire star is lost to the cause of HWM's butchery of ""Radio"" one of my favorite Alk3 songs. I can understand adding a second guitar part, and MAYBE changing the original one, but SCREWING UP THE WORDS??? NO. Their cover of ""Bleeder"" was almost as equally disappionting. Altogether though, I love the record."
4,It Works!,"Well unless you've been living in a cave in Borneo, you know the importance of stretching,not only golf but for better everyday living. The author writes an easy to follow precription on how to best prepare for pre-game warm-up. As a former athlete I had no problem following the Golf Flex routine. But my wife(a new golfer and not an athlete)had difficulty understanding the difference between static and dynamic stretching, how and why they apply to sports performance. Teaching your wife golf is a little like teaching someone you love to drive- its best left to professionals. So I bought the Golf Flex video to give her. It was much more through, and seeing someone do the stretches, showed her exactly what she needed to do. So if your new to stretching, I highly recomend the Golf Flex video. If you have a basic understanding of flexibility, then the book is all you'll need. Well done!"
2,Not impressed,"I was looking for a stretching program geared specifically to golfers, intead I found a set of stretches and conditioning exercises that were really not very useful to an athletic 30 year old.This book is great if you don't go to a gym, have never stretched, and are in really poor shape.However if you are active, fit, do some weight training and know about basic stretching (and I mean basic) then save your $$, e.g. there are examples of exercises using soup tins for your deltoids etc ... obviously this has not been written for the better golfer, or the fit golfer, but instead for the very unfit golfer.I was hoping for something that would help me push the envelope -this book is certainly not it."
2,"Exercise List, Little Plan","I have 3 other stretching books, so in comparison this listed all the same exercises with 2 or 3 new ones I hadn't seen. I felt the lack of a comprehensive plan on how to implement this long-term was what was really necessary. I have 3-4 minutes to stretch, so I want the most benefit for my time rather than being told ""do alot more."""
2,Didn't Stretch My Knowledge or Golf Swing,"More like a basic book on stretching, didn't seem that targeted to golf. What about all the new stretching devices and techniques I hear about at my club? No mention here, just some basic stuff. From my limited experience, stretching is good for golf, but not the only thing, and this isn't the cliff notes of stretching for golfers."
5,i love salon selectives,"i found the salon selective products on cosmeticmall.com and you can still order from there. i did and it went through, i should be getting mine in the mail any day now."
3,It's a base plate.,"It's a base plate, what more is there to write. If you order the proper one for your router everything ought to be fine."
4,A must for the fan of The Hitchhikers Guide and Red Dwarf,Robert Rankin's humor is right in line with the classic Hitchhikers series and Red Dwarf. I would recommend this read to anyone who is looking for a little romp.
4,Read This Book,"The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse is pretty much a crazy book--track it down and read it. From the reviews on these pages, it is harder to find this book than it was for Jack and Eddie, the young boy and stuffed bear heroes of the book to solve the mysterious murders in Toy City. Humpty Dumpty has been boiled to death--and other nursery rhyme protagonists soon follow. Toy City is a bizarre place where toys are real, as are people and nursery rhymes and other oddities. Jack is new to the town, and, like the reader, is perpetually amazed at the weirdness of Toy City. This book is very, very funny--a bit (well, more than a bit) off center--but just a delight to read. It's a blend of science fiction, fantasy, humor and mystery--somewhat like the Thursday Next series in its odd blending of multiple genres. Fun, weird fun, but still fun."
2,Unchanging voice,I got bored with this one. I skipped a lot of the pages.... The voice of the author stayed the same throughout and that lulled me to sleep. I was so glad to be done with it.
4,Almost Flawless,"The plot of this book is amazing. I've never seen one even remotely like it. It's full of unexpected twists and interesting characters and it keeps you guessing until the end. The only thing that disappointed me about this book is who the killer turned out to be. The clues didn't point to this person and when I found out I wasn't like ""What?! Him?! No way!"". I was like ""Oh...well that kinda sucks."" But other than that it was a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy/mystery."
3,read it - GREAT!,"""it's as sweet as"" - Eddie.having now read the book i have to say that it is an interesting trippy read. the language takes a bit of getting used to, simply because it is very straight forward, very much like nursery stories. As Jack and Eddie try to solve the murders of various nursery rhyme characters it is anything but.Also it's a quirky self aware detective story as well. At one point our heros decide to do nothing but wait for a twist - since those always happen.all in all a quirky, interesting, strange, funny, and entertaining read."
3,What the hell was that?,"Like many others, I could not resist the title, which is more entertaining than the main read. I give the author 3 stars because it rambled on too long, but the concept was pretty funny and the gist of the book was weird, but interesting. It was surprising, to say the least, but in a good way. It is a detective story in every sense of the word, but hardly a normal one. You have to love it for wandering way off the track.It begins with a young boy named Jack making his way to the big city to seek his fortune. On the way he runs across a cannibalistic farmer who tries to kill him to eat. He steals the farmers horse and eventually arrives in Toy City, formally known as Toy Town where all the citizens are toys with a caste system. The old rich are the nursery rhymn characters, i,e, Humpty Dumpty, Little Miss Muffet. The old rich are being murdered in imaginative ways that relate to their ryhmns. Jack with the help of a drunken, set out to solve the crimes."
1,Completely Horrible,"I don't give up on books often, but I just couldn't finish it. Like others, the title and cover drew me in, along with what I skimmed before buying it. Although the first chapter was a small interesting story and did stick in my mind, the rest of the book was just a throw up of words and a terrible plot. Its slow, mundane, and doesn't get to the point, plus there's a sequel you have to read? DONT waster your time with it. It's an embarrassment to science fiction."
5,Great book,"I love this book. I first listened to it as an audiobook and liked it so much I bought it to share with my kids. I read it to them at night, and I do just a little minor re-wording to keep it appropriate for them."
3,Very different,"This was a very different book. Mildly interesting, a little funny. Didn't like it enough to read the next book in the series."
2,Should of listened to the other reviews before I started to read this book,"When I read the describtion of the book it sounded like something I would really enjoy. I read a couple of reviews and just figured these people have no idea what their talking about. Wow am I regreting that, I couldn't even finish the book. The writing style is really awful. Before you purchase this book I suggest you read the 1st couple pages that amazon will present to you before actually buying."
4,Light reading for summer entertainment,"The premise starts off innocently enough, but quickly takes an unexpected turn into the surreal, before returning to a lulling, predictable story arc. This rhythmically occurs for the duration of the book, cycling from predictable, but entertaining scenes of fantasy, to surreal twists that take the story in an unexpected new direction. The last few chapters almost breaks the careful investment of the reader into the characters with its sudden 90 degree twist, but by this point you will be compelled to follow, and it doesn't disappoint at the end.An excellent vacation or summer holiday book, not too thought provoking, yet snappy enough to keep you engaged and entertained.Enjoy!"
4,My First Rankin Experience...and lookin' for more,"This was a fun summer book that I read in the spring. A lot of play with language, myth, nursery rhymes, and expectations. The approach involves simple inversions but with a joy and playfulness that makes these new cliches untroubling and even fun.The characters are engaging, the narrative focused, the language playful in the way of the 'Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy', and the attitude droll. Very British. If you do not like British humour stay away...but if you can embrace that this book is 'as good as'.I gave it only 3 stars because I save 4 & 5 for works of genius or those that blow my hair back with some new twist. This work is predictable all the way through but...damn...it was a great ride.A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SUMMER BOOK FOR PEOPLE WITH MORE THAN 2 BRAINCELLS TO RUB TOGETHER...OR THOSE THAT WISHED THEY HAD MORE THAN TWO. :)"
2,"not as good as Adams, Holt or Pratchett","Yeah, whoever said if one likes Douglas Adams one will like this.... not so much. It was an ok read, but defnitely ot up to par with what I expected."
3,Shame on Amazon.com,"I like this book. I read a library copy and decided to buy my own personal copy. I received it today and someone placed a barcode sticker over the printing on the back. The sticker isn't an easy to remove sticker, and I am afraid of ruining the cover. Please don't cover the printing on the back with a barcode sticker."
5,Funny and Brilliant,Two words - funny and brilliant and like Teddy bear - full of lifes sour sweet sawdust.
1,Not as clever as the title...,"I bought this book because of the clever title and blurb on the back from SFX: ""Buy this book"", but found it almost unreadable.Maybe I would have enjoyed it 25 years ago -- it's full of sarcasm, wordplay, references and literary conceits, but these days I just find that irritating, although I tried to like it.The basic problem (for me, anyway) is that when an author creates a fantasy universe, he has an obligation to create a believable universe with natural laws, believable social customs and some kind of compelling narrative. It's too easy to say 'Well, this is my universe and since I make the rules, so I can do anything I want"". The result of that attitude is usually an incoherent mess, as is the case here.I know this book will appeal to some people, and there's no accounting for taste, but it doesn't do anything for me. YMMV."
5,Hilarious,"Robert Rankin is either a genius or a mental patient, but either way this book is amazing. Funny --no, beyond funny-- clever, original, this is more than a fantasy, more than a detective novel, more than science fiction and more than humor. I highly HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who appreciates twisted humor, plot twists both subtle and outrageous, insanity in its highest forms, and mystery at its most mysterious."
1,Short Lived Portable Ice Maker - Continental,"Purchased Aug 06,began leaking water underneath first month?? Still made ice, so decided it was a flaw with machine. Then two-three prongs stopped making ice and 6 mos later only two prongs make ice. Contacted seller and waiting to hear about warranty?? Most likely none...pls read fine print for repairs/labor and shipping back etc. let alone replacement for not living up to specs. Too much money spent to see it useless after 6 mos!"
2,And Now a Lean Dictionary,"This pricey little (5"" x 8"" spiral bound) listing of lean manufacturing terms (Lean Enterprise style) is a good (and the only one that I know of) compilation of the Japanese lanquage terms of lean manufacturing replete with diagrams.It is a great reference for all the lean wanna be's and is great for settling lean terminology bets, but it is far too shallow a reference to appreciably improve your knowledge of lean manufacturing."
5,My new favorite!,"I haven't read all of Palmer's books yet, but I have read many, and this one is now at the top of the list. While it has many of the same ideas typical of her books - young virgin adores older man who has watched her grow up and won't let himself fall for her until she's in danger and then he realizes he can't live without her (whew!) - this one is Palmer at her best with all those details. Janie is a strong woman who wants Leo but won't trail after him like a lovesick pup. Leo fights his attraction to her but doesn't intentionally try to hurt her to drive her away. And they even *wait* until their wedding night, but there are several really hot scenes ahead of time that are also among the most tender I have read from Palmer. Terrific dialogue and intriguing secondary characters help to make this one a keeper!"
4,Had to have it on my kindle.,I am a big fan of Diana Palmer..I have this book in paperback.. And had to have it on the kindle..
3,Typical Palmer,"If you like Diane Palmer, this follows the same formula, but the guy isn't as jerky, so I thought it was better than usual. I've decided I'm not a fan though."
4,Decent for the price,"Decent entry level tripod. Great for beginners..and can be used by pro's..though a professional photog might find a few things missing. But, it works for me."
2,Not very sturdy,It's good for a very light cam and that's all. I use it as a fake steady cam. Works good for that.
4,great value - perfect for small diameter branches,5 for the price of 1 comparable blade at a big box store. There were 23 hedges in my yard that the previous owner hadn't maintained in years. They measured 10 ft x 75 ft with stalks up to 2-3 inches in diamaeter. I cleared them all with 1 blade over about 6 hrs. One negative is that it's the wrong tool for thin shoots which bend too much to efficiently cut with a recipricating saw. So I went back & forth between my saw and pruners more than I wanted.
2,Don't get me wrong...,"I like Mark Leyner, but this book (his first) is way below par. It's obviously juvenilia, dressed up by Vintage after Leyner's success, and recovered from the tiny press (the Fiction Collective, Boulder) who took this unformed, trivial, pretentious book on in the first place. There are a few funny lines and some evocative moments in here, but overall it's not worth the time or money. Work your way back to this one from the books published since Leyner learned how to write."
1,Beware,"Don't misunderstand: everything Leyner's done after this first collection is brilliant writing and mandatory reading. But ESTHER WILLIAMS is the most godawful hodgepodge of literary conceits and pratfalls you may ever be unlucky enough to read. Obviously, some episode of satori marked the time between this and his next book, the now-classic MY COUSIN, MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST. I'm being harsher than I should be, perhaps, considering how great a satirist Leyner has become. But even he probably wishes this book would crawl off his resume. Take a pass on ESTHER and go straight to his other four collections."
4,More Pleasure for Fans of CRUM!,"Maynard's SCREAMING WITH THE CANNIBALS takes on the next stage in the life of the narrator of CRUM, which has a large following of enthusiastic readers.This one picks up the story where CRUM left off. Fans will leap at the opportunity to find out what happened to Jesse- and yes, the narrator of the first book finally gets a name! Jesse is presented as a sort of archetype of all those young adventurers who need to see what is on the other side of the next ridge. He wants to move on, to escape from everything in his old life. In the final part of this book, he gets as far as South Carolina where he experiences racism, the ocean, and forgiveness. The long scene in which Jesse escapes a Kentucky revival meeting with his soul unsaved and his skin intact is worth the price of the book. He doesn't find everything he's looking for, but there is more than a hint that Maynard isn't through with his story."
5,Read Crum First!!!,"I first heard of Lee Maynard while listening to his interview with Terry Gross on NPR. I grew up in Chattaroy, not far from Crum - so, I was compelled to read the book. Even though I grew up there in the 1970s and 1980s, little had changed from the time in which the book was set. We were more mobile, but fundamentally, the same time and place. We did the same things and had as much fun, as many fights and forged enough friendships and memories to last a lifetime. It was a walk down memory lane and a fantastic journey for anyone. Read the book!!!I've ordered Cannibals - now that I've finished Crum - I can't wait for it to arrive. I'll check back in with a proper review later.A special thanks to Lee Maynard for pulling those memories back into my present."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I was told this was a great book by a friend and I am convinced she got the title wrong. It's not that it is a bad book, it just isn't too interesting."
3,Not really hair-raising...,"I was not thrilled with this book. If you are looking for something fun and silly to read, then this book is for you. If you are looking for a book with a little more information about hair, you'd be better off with something else, maybe ""The Hairgrower's Guide"" or ""The Hair Bible""."
3,"And You Thought Life ""In the Bigs"" was Easy","Porter takes the reader through a hellacious sequence of events that affected his life. He documents how a first single beer led a downward spiral into serious drug and alcohol abuse. After hitting near bottom, Porter turned around his life to become MVP of the World Series for the Cardinals. Read how Porter still struggles to stay sober and grow into the person he desparately wishes to be."
5,Highly recommended for people seeking spiritual truth,"I first read The Advent two years ago in a Russian translation. As someone who has practiced Sahaja Yoga for 15 years at the time of writing, I found the book scintillating and fascinating, and I learnt a lot of theory that was new to me.A must ""read'."
5,this is related to you,"I bet that anyone on this crazy world would identify him/herself with some part of this book. It's so amazind how the author reaches each and every personal and collective problem we face nowadays. And he gives an answer, and a way of overcoming them. And it's not a impossible thing, but it requires our will power to really do something for ourselves that won't misleade us into these worldly delusions, and we must throw away all the bad conditionings the society and the old religions has imposed in our minds. I feel I am really free and experiencing my immortal essence following what the author suggests in this book, and I invite you to get out of you daily slumber."
4,german at a glance,"A fine introduction to basic German vocabulary. I used it prior to a trip to Germany & Austria, & was able to communicate adequately in my travels.Stephanie O."
4,Word Clues Review,"Word Clues is a book I am studying in English class. I think it is good because it really teaches about the vocabulary. It teaches roots, prefixes, and suffixes, as well as words that use them. There are about 15 words in each lesson, so it helps learn at a slow and steady pace."
3,Is an ordinary fare,"Director Parto Ghosh makes a sincere attempt to strike the right balance between drama and titillation, but is letdown by a not-too-inspiring script. Music [Daboo Malik] is nothing much to hum about. Cinematography is appealing, with the visuals of Dubai giving the film a rich look.Payal Rohatgi does the dare-bare part without any apprehensions, but needs to go easy on her expressions at times. Navneet Kaur is alright. Jatin Grewal needs to loosen up more as an actor. Kiran Kumar is wasted. Mushtaq Khan is passable.On the whole, CHETNA - THE EXCITEMENT is an ordinary fare."
2,Cheetah is noisy!,"The Cheetah works well on my Quadra-Fire pellet stove but it is much noisier than a vacuum cleaner! I purchased it (but not the stove) from a local stove place in Central Massachusetts and once I realized I had been sold the noisier version, I called the place back. They assured me that once the Cougars came in that I could swap the top of the unit while retaining my canister and filter. Well, after several months of follow up calls this place says they have never received any Cougars and even wondered if they were still made! I wish I had checked this site first! I never should have purchased the Cheetah and I think this stove place is the real cheata. I Would suggest purchasing the Cougar since it is about the same price."
1,mu305 ash vacumn,"WAS HOPING FOR MORE, DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT. OKAY FOR VERY SMALL AREA TO BE CLEANED, NOZZLE NEEDS TO BE WIDER, NEEDS TWICE THE POWER IT HAS. I WONT USE IT FOR THE WOOD STOVE BUT WILL FIND ANOTHER USE SINCE I HAVE IT."
3,Helpful,The pellet stove is pretty (I got my daughter the winter scene model for Christmas). The vacuum works well and she's happy with it. The only problem seems to be that half burned pellets tend to get stuck in the vacuum and she has to turn it off and shake out the pellets. That could be dangerous if there happens to be an ember stuck along with the pellet.
1,Piece of crap!!,"All I have say is DO NOT waste your hard earned money on this product. I've had it for about a month now, using it for my pellet stove. It clogs in about two minutes and the suction is horrible. I bought an extra filter pack and thought it might be that but within two minutes it did the same thing. It does have the rod to knock off some of the dust off the filter but the suction is already lost at that point. I don't usually complain about products I buy but I just had to on this one. DO NOT BUY!"
2,not great for woodstoves/fireplaces,"Well, it sounds like pellet stove users are having an overall good experience with these ash vacums.However, I am not convinced this product works well for woodstove and fireplace cleanup. I have had a heck of time keeping mine from clogging up on the embers. Embers are common in the ashes of both woodstoves and fireplaces. No matter how hard I tried, they kept geting stuck in the inside the hose. I even removed the steel nozzel thinking that might solve the problem. Now they seem to get stuck where the hoze meets the chamber. As such, I do not recommend this product for woodstove and fireplace cleanup.I found a lidded shovel scoop and use that instead; it is not perfect against creating ash dust, but is quick and easy.Good luck!"
2,Disappointed,"The vacuum cleaner arrived with a huge crack in the housing. So, actually, I wasn't too happy with it, and would never order one over the internet again."
2,Cheetah II,This vacuum is so loud my ears ring after using it. I also dislike the filter which is not washable.
3,Great but loud as heck,"To prevent burning down my house, I went for the 'Cadillac' of ash vacs. It really works great and the metal hose is very flexible but you need to wear ear plugs when you use it and send the family out of the house. This baby is LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It screams. There is a 'quieter' model but I've read on forums that it is just as loud."
3,Cheetah Vacuum,"Tired of cleaning out my fireplace with a brush and shovel, I searched and found this product. I was intrigued. The description now that I have it in place seems to boost it for sales....Performance worked as described, however the noisiness was very loud and louder than I wanted and expected based on the description provided. Fortunately it doesn't take that long to clean out the fireplace so overall I am pleased with this product. I would purchase it again, but would like to see a more accurate portrayal of the noise level"
4,excellent product,The product works really well. We have used it several times with no problems. The suction is strong. The only complaint is I wish the cord was longer.
4,HelpfulAshVac,"Considering the work that we're asking the Cheetah II Ash Vacuum to do, I think it performs pretty well. There are always a lot of larger pieces left in the wood stove that will clog the end of the hose so I've found it best to shovel those pieces out and then vacuum up the ash afterwards. That's what really I wanted it to do anyway since the real pain in cleaning the stove is getting the ash out. I've been please with the amount of ash the vac holds so I don't have to empty it every time I clean the stove. It does a great job of picking up everything so the stove is really cleaned out. The design is pretty simple making it easy to set up and care for. The assembly instructions were a bit vague so it took a little bit to figure out what the designer was trying to accomplish so I could figure out how the filters were attached.The product is not a solve all solution for cleaning the wood stove, but over all I think it's a good value."
5,Best vacuum for pellet stove,"Best vacuum for pellet stoves, no mess when using. ash vacuumed into a container and stored until ash is disposed. None of the fine ash expelled into the air when using. The noise level is not over bearing, it sounds like a Hover or Shopvac vacuum. I recommend this vacuum highly for all pellet stoves"
1,Horrible craftsmanship,"We wanted a vacuum that could handle at least ""warm"" coals. Not this one. Our fireplace had been cool for 2 days and the junk hose connector (which is plastic and makes no sense...) melted the first use! I understand that there are hidden embers, but this vacuum should be better suited to handle them. It was unbelievable. We sent it back the next day for a refund. We have an old Loveless Ash Vac from 20+ years afoot and it works great. That's why we chose this brand. But I suppose the changing times and economy have caused everyone to go cheap. Real disappointment, to say the least. I wish you could rate zero stars."
3,just okay,"This ash vac is good as far as not sending dust everywhere. The ash does however clog the hose, which is a pain. You have to take it outside and knock the ash loose. This could be because we have an insert and the ash is so fine. I gave it a three because it could just be my ash is so fine, not because the vacuum itself. I do however look at it as a waste of money. It is easier just to shovel the ash and our craftsman to clean up."
3,Another Dolls re-re-re-release,"This CD was originally released as the LP ""Red Patent Leather"" on Skydog Records.If you already have that, you don't need this, it's another re-release of that lousy show. The sound quality of this was awful when it was released, I keep hoping that someone will do to this what was done to the Velvet Underground'sLive at Max's Kansas City (Dlx)but no luck yet, just another clone of an already released/pirated show. For many years, this was about all of the New York Dolls live show that was available, and it really wasn't representative; Much better live shows of The Dolls/Dollettes (as they were known after Thunders split) exist in fan trading circles.Four stars for the Dolls expulsion of energy in this recording, minus one star for abysmal bootleg-quality sound."
2,"Mostly scrap save for ""Take Control Of The Party""","""Take Control Of The Party"" is a thumping, beat-heavy party anthem that belongs on a list of all time greatest party songs. Unfortunately, a trash can is where the rest of this album belongs."
3,Good book for beginners,"This a good book for beginners but does not go beyond the basics. If you have extensively used 123 or Symphony you will not find this book very helpful. It is a basic manual not a ""howto"" book. For old time Lotus fans it is a good paper weight."
3,OK,"At least I didn't hurt muself when I opened it. Bought this item for someone else, so no feedback provided."
5,Finally available in the US!!,"I discovered Vichy skincare products in St. Martin several years ago and have been hooked ever since. Vichy (part of the Loreal/Lancome companies) up until now has not been available in the U.S. After my first stash ran out I didn't want to go back to using another brand -- I've gone so far as to order Vichy products from suppliers in England or Israel to assure I don't run out.Every item in this line that I have tried on my very sensitive, very dry skin has made my skin feel soft and younger-looking. A little bit goes a very long way -- a jar lasts about 6 months with daily use. I'm thrilled to be able to buy Vichy products through Amazon!"
5,life saver for dry skin,"amd very dry skin of the face, especially during the winter.personally, i prefer vichy facial cream structure, rich but not heavy or greasy, and my skin likes most vichy products.this is my favorite for winter."
4,It works,Came on time. Does the needful but my husband hates the smell so I cannot use it. He says it smells like rotten fish. Can something be done about it.
5,excellent cream,"This cream is wonderful, the next day you notice how your face makes a change and a good price, I love it, use it, it's worth."
5,A Diamond Indeed,"The blended voices and silken stylings of this all male chorus sings tribute to the beauty of the Oxacan folk song tradition. Unfettered by modern synthesized production techniques, the Rondalla Tapatia remains true to the acoustic tradition of the music of la raza. Each cancion is well founded on a strong and confident guitar ensemble, with firm bass lines played in octaves driving the latin rythms. The embellishment of tenor and treble guitar duet lines dashes tropical color to the pieces and flavors the work with traditional Spanish Mudejar spice. The fugue phrasing of the Rondalla is a classic choral gem in a swimming waltz tempo which alone is more than enough to warrant purchase of this wonderful production. The Rondalla Tapatia chorus is a Mexican National Treasure, with fervid appeal to the senses and a stirring strum of your heart strings. To miss this collection is to overlook the soul of Mejico. - FCD"
4,bad title,"Even though this is a pretty informative book, the title really is deceptive. The reason I bought it is because I recently got my private license and thought this book might give me some ideas on how I could use it. Sort of like a list of 101 creative ways I could use my license - fly for charities, ferry planes, etc. However, this book has nothing to do with that. It's a misc list of topics about flying. From weather to airports to buying a plane.Although it's a good little book, I didn't want anybody to make the same mistake I did."
3,Very light duty,"I fly my American and Gadsden flag year round. This flag was inexpensive, and is reflected in it's construction. Very light materials, and not really suited for continuous outdoor use. The screen print is fairly light, and does not show up as well as others I have flown. I would expect this flag to maybe last 30 days +/- outdoors."
4,great customer service,"After the order got lost in the mail, they sent us a new flag ASAP, and my husband was thrilled. THANKS"
3,Not too bad for the price,"Different from the picture displayed, only shows the wirting on one side, but I still think it's a good investment for the price. To hang in a room on display works out, but I wouldn't recommoned leaving it outside for a long time. And fyi the ""DONT TREAD ON ME"" is displayed in Times New Roman Font as ""DON'T TREAD ON ME"""
4,Ok product,"This flag was what I would call ok, not the best quality but you pay what you get. The flag is somewhat see through but the detail is ok."
2,False Advertising,"The flag I received does not mirror the picture, there is a different font and the snake image seems a little off. I do not recommend."
3,Quick shipment but cheap materials,Flag was very cheap materails and the gromets look like they'll rip at signs of high winds.
5,Great flag!,Had this flag for over 5 years inside my house and still love it. No unravelling or shrinking when you throw it in the dryer to get the dust off.
2,OK for hanging it on the wall,The flag is a disappointment that I cant fly it due to it only being one sided. OK for a walls
5,Dont Tread On Me!,This is a GREAT flag..It is a great way to represent your political thoughts. It shows that you care!
1,Never received it,"I never received item because there was a change of shipping address that did not get to the vendor in time. Item was charged against credit card, but was never sent."
5,great quality,"Perfect quality for the money. this flag should cost more, its a steal for the price i payed for it."
3,Tea Party Flag,Show your neighbors where you stand with this historic reproduction of a Revolutionary War flag of defiance. Taxed Enough Already.
1,One sided,"I can not recommend this item. I have no idea why the other purchasers rate this so high.First, and this is big, it is only 1 sided. Meaning, it would fine as a banner or wall mounted, but not as a outdoor flag. And certainly not to be carried at a Tea Party, as I had intended to do.Second, it is not an accurate Gadsen flag. The snake looks very amateurish. The eye is so poor it looks like part of the diamond pattern. The tongue is only a little nub that doesn't even extend past the mouth. Also, there is no punctuation. The ""DON'T"" is not on there, instead it is ""DONT"". On a 3'x5' flag it is significant. And adds to the amateur appearence of the flag.Third, and lastly, it is made in China.Avoid this product if you are trying to make a statement."
2,"one sided wall hanging, not a flag","So, the writing is backwards on one side, because this is a simple print on thin fabric.Stitching and grommets are acceptable."
2,Description inaccurate,"Flag came with just one grommet, the lower one. Hard to hang a flag with just one grommet. I will have to buy a grommet kit to use the flag."
4,I paid $5 for this flag,"It looks great and for $5 you can't go wrong. Most flags and all of them that I came across are only printed on one side and this is also the case for this flag. There is no quality issue that I can see between this flag and a $20 flag and there is no difference either. Save some cash, buy this flag."
1,Poor quality,The material is very thin. I ordered 2 of these flags and both were cut crooked. Not worth my time to send them back and get another inferior item sent to me. I would not recommend buying.
5,Love it!,This flag looks just great in my dorm room. I just need to iron out the creases from it being shipped.
5,Excellent service and product!,Got here faster than planned and its great looking flag. Thanks! This is like my 3rd purchase from this company.
4,Can't be beat for the price,"Even with the high shipping cost, the total cost of this item is very reasonable. This is not the type of flag that I would fly outside for long periods of time or in nasty weather, but for displaying indoors or the occasional outdoor use, this flag is great. Be careful though, apparently this flag has ties to ""right wing extremist"" groups."
5,Love it!,Great value. Looks great on my beautiful granite vanity top (bathroom). I bought two so I will have another when the first one wears out.I also bought the little soap dish. Love them both!
3,A little disappointed,"I received this as a gift, but it looks pretty cheaply made. I like the looks of it, but the top part appears to be made of very cheap plastic which I am not expecting to hold up very long. I am still looking forward to using it, as I do like the way it looks, just would prefer that it last a little longer than I think it will."
1,Cosmi not worth your effort,"This product was so lame. Microsoft Word offers more publishing features, graphics, etc. Please don't waste your time or money on this."
5,So many coincidences...,"Even if only 10% of this story were true, it would still explain the lies and deception. I was blown away by the extreme number of odd coincidences."
1,Not safe for human consumption,"I received this film in the mail from a group that sent it to me for free, unrequested. I watched about ten minutes of it--witness a narrator pretending to be Obama, the insinuation that Obama was a ""red diaper baby"" (Who even uses that phrase any more? Who made this move?) And of course the claim that Obama's father was a black Communist poet who looks nothing like Obama. Complete hogwash."
1,This shouldn't even be on Amazon - it's fraud not to mention full of lies and racist,"Please report this item as fraudulent. It does not star Barack Obama and is misleading. If you want to put your trashy racist lies somewhere, try youtube or a blog."
1,Good Grief!,"I considered giving it 5 stars due to the skill it uses to sway simple minded people to believe something completely false. This, my friends, is how it was done in Nazi Germany. Propaganda is a dangerous thing because many people are so easily led down a path of lies provided the shepherd is clever to make things plausible. Take it apart folks and examine it using your brain. One star because 1. it's a hoax and 2. it takes people for utter fools. Wow, I can't believe the people in these reviews who can't connect the dots and see past this slick presentation."
4,"Should be required viewing for anyone who voted for our so called ""transparent president"".",Well documented film and interested me so much that I had to visit my local library and check out a biography on his mom; the late Stanley Ann Dunham. It is sad that she died of ovarian cancer before her son became president.
5,Wow is all I have to say.,"I knew from the get go things with this man did not add up. And the media and liberals would and do froth over any insinuation of anything at all. Excellent documentary and makes you really think. They say a picture is worth a 1,000 words. When you see Obama and Davis side by side there can be little of any doubt as to the truth. I would even go so far to say that the birthers are plants to drive people away and far away from reality. I lived in South America to work and saw 2 Presidential elections (both socialist) and they used the same stupid meaningless slogans and people lapped it up. What can you say? But this was very well-done."
1,"""Dreams of My Real Father"" is speculation","A friend lent this ""documentary"" to me. I am not a fan of Obama, but this video was not something I would recommend. Parts of it may be true, but, as the back of the package says it ""weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic and speculation in an attempt to fill in the obvious gaps in Obama's history."" Speculation is the key word. If you want to see really good documentary on the president and not a speculative story, see the movie, ""2016--Obama's America"" I am embarrassed that this video will just add more fuel to the Left's fire that people on the Right are a bunch of paranoid nutcases."
1,Why do people believe this is true,I worry that so much of America can be out of touch with reality and will believe that this book has worth. It is obvious that the President is not a socialist or a communist.
1,Unoriginal and untruthful,The book is another hit job from the fringe. Why do people buy this stuff? It is an attempt to twist the history to fit the preconceptions of the extreme right.
1,Pack of lies,It's shocking that someone has so little respect for the truth as to be able to simply make facts up and pass them off as the truth.
1,Offensive and Ridiculous,"To those of you who buy into the idiotic notion that because Barack Obama does not look like his father, his ""real"" father is someone else---please, have you seen the photos of the young boy with his mother and grandfather? To those of you who say Obama's life story is shrouded in mystery--please, pull the blankets off your head and read something other than right wing conspirators. To Amazon, shame on you for flogging this garbage. This is just more from the ""birthers."" I gave it one star because the system will not let me give it none."
1,Are you serious?,"I will put this garbage video next to the video that states that the POTUS is the son Malcolm X! You dummies REALLY need to find some other hobby to get into, yeah I called it a HOBBY, for if this man wasn't the pres you would make NO ATTEMPT to ""figure out"" who he ""really"" is. Please kick rocks elsewhere."
1,MORE SUPPORT NEEDED,THIS FILM MAKES CLAIMS WITHOUT DOING THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATIVE WORK TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE CLAIMS. IF THE PRODUCER COULD PRODUCE EVIDENCE FOR THESE CLAIMS I THINK THAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD STAND UP AND TAKE NOTICE. I DID FIND IT VERY INTERESTING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING
3,Dreams From my Real Father,Interesting theories. Good factual back up on most allegations but it was a strech for some of the allegations. The documentary style and Obama sounding voice over was interesting and kept my attention. I am still trying to decide who to vote for. This election is a biggie.
1,Drivel of the first order,"Tries and fails to make the case that Obama is a ""Manchurian Candidate"" - All under a veil of very poorly disguised white supremacy..."
1,Not for the objective..,"This was poorly sited, full of half lies, and plenty of full lies. I don't even care for Obama either way, but if you are going to make a propaganda film like this, do a LITTLE fact checking.Be objective, and so some research."
2,POOR MAN VERSION OF OBAMA 2016,I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE SO THAT I COULD PROMOTE IT. UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS HARD TO GET PAST THE BAD IMPRESSIONATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE. THIS MOVIE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD HAD ONE NOT SEEN OBAMA 2016. DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY. SEE OBAMA 2016. WISH I COULD RETURNED THIS DVD.
1,Bitterly disappointing,"Badly directed, badly produced, mindlessly repeating an unproved and unprovable assertion that another man was BHO's father. Including a ridiculous segment attempting to claim that Obama's mother was a fetish/pornography model, which even if true, what's the point!This is so bad that the claim that a million Dvds are being mailed to voters horrifys me. If true it convinces me that this must be a democratic plot to discredit ""2016 Obamas America"" which is being released next month and is devastating to Obamas image."
1,Propagandist claims about our President,"A warped vision from a radical racist bent on destroying America. One just need view any of Joel Gilbert's other works to get the nasty after taste that is left to know what to expect from this hyperbolic piece of slop. Though I have to admit that I felt it was better produced than Dinesh D'Souza's movie, it still struggled to paint a picture that has never existed and grasped at links that failed to be proven.If you are some racist bigot, you might find some enjoyment in this far fetched dreamscape that tries to paint our President as some ""Manchurian Candidate"" but, once again, it is just another propaganda feature created to confuse and frustrate those who believe in our Country.Vote Obama/Biden in 2012 or some other third party."
1,Just ignore this horrible movie,"I wish Amazon let you give a movie zero stars, because this one deserves no stars whatsoever. The movie is nothing but a ridiculous lie -- don't believe any of it. Joel Gilbert clearly never got the message that the 1950's ""Red Scare"" is over..."
4,THE TRUTH COMES TO LIGHT,"Phenominal story, one plus one does equal two. A and B leads to CThis all makes perfect sense,great informationSCARY ,TRUE STUFFJeff"
2,A Revealing Look into the Psyche of America's Rightwing,"This is the latest in a new genre of Obama Derangement films. An alternate history of the rise of the first African-American president. In this timeline Sarah Palin was a genius, John McCain didn't exist, and a man named George Bush was never president. This film is full of the same comfortable lies familiar to audiences of other films like ""2016: Obama's America."" After watching you may feel sorry for the people who believe this stuff, they go through life thinking the presidency was stolen by a veritable monster and no one can see it but them. Just remember that it's a nightmare of their own creation."
1,String of out takes with a dribble of commentary,"This documentary is a bunch of self directed commentary to out takes, one liners, and review of a book. The writer / director even admits in the beginning that this is how things might have been and is based on many assumptions and their attempt at logical conclusions. I would say its worth a look as it gives you a snapshot into the mind of the right wing republican GOP acting to incite hatred towards Obama and drive wedges in between classes. Take it with a grain of salt!"
4,47%,"This was a good documentary that raises some valid questions about Obama's past. Of course, it wouldn't make any difference to the ones that voted for him to get the handouts from the government, and the liberals who are looking for their socialist utopia."
5,Wish this had been out in 2008,This explain's alot!! I wish we had Real Reporter's in America today who did their Job's.Instead we have Progressive Cheerleader's who spin with a Liberal Slant.Go back and check the top Stories of any year and see if they told the Truth..
1,Are you kidding me?,This is an ultra right-wing propaganda piece full of racism and bizarre lies. I can't even believe it's been included here for viewing it's such a piece of trash.
1,Bleh,It had all the fun of a lecture in differential equations given by Ben Stein. It was repetitious and seemed to be stretching for content.
3,Biological Father...no. Significant influencer in Obama's life...yes!,"It is likely that this man is not Obama's biological father. But that is really not significant as he did play a very present, significant part of Obama's life. In his book ""Dreams from my father"" he referred numerous times to this man. Because of this he undoubtedly absorbed much of the ideaology of this man as well as other radical men. He even said he sought out these people in his book. People tend to keep company with like-minded individuals."
1,Trash,"This film is trash. There are no facts, just twisted truths. I don't see how anyone can even believe this crap."
2,This is misinformation.,My step-mom's family got this in the mail. We were visiting when they watched it. I don't understand why someone would pay to make a movie that is almost entirely an attack on a dead woman.
1,Seriously?!,"Nope. I will not be having any of this nonsense on my bookshelf. This is not the way to win an election either, sorry!"
1,It stinks!,A documentary containing no real facts or cited references is just a glorified rant with pretty pictures. Do yourself a favor and save your self an afternoon in watching this film.
1,Fiction from start to finish,"This video is being sent out to swing states, much like the ""documentary"" on Muslim extremists and Barack's supposed Muslim background in 2008. The funders of this film remained anonymous, and frankly, I don't blame them. You can't fact check ANY of the claims this film makes, and using facial features to determine paternity is BS. Speculation, lies, and propaganda presented as fact. Shame on you Mr. Gilbert."
1,"Racist,untrue screed should be removed from Amazon","Anyone thinking they are getting a documentary about President Obama is in for a severe shock. This is bottom feeder slime, lower than low, and totally false. If Bezos had any integrity he would remove it fom Amazon!"
4,See Photos!!!,"This is a jaw dropping video. Take a good look at the photos and see who POTUS resembles. If you have any doubt about who's the daddy, you need to see this one. It makes a lot of things I had questions about fall into place. A real Aha film."
5,The Real Truth about Barry Davis!,This is very good and tells the real story of who Barry's father really is. It now makes sense why he wrote the original Dreams From My Father as a cover-up to his real heritage! A real card carrying communist!
1,Pure propaganda,"The core of the story cannot be validated - this is just another attempt for someone to exploit the election and partisanship in this country to make a few bucks, a real disappointment."
3,Dreams from my real father,"It gave me less new information than I had hoped, but maybe that is because I have tried for four years to determine the real truth about Obama and have been exposed to many stories about him."
4,Dreams from my Real father,This documentary attempts to eliminate any doubt as to the true parentage of the president; it is well documented and leads one to believe that Frank Davis can be the only person that fits the debate over who is the father of the president.
5,Now it all makes sense !!!,"I have been wondering how an individual could be so socialistic and become a top politicial leader....he's had a lot of help, and deception is the game - at our expense....."
1,Propaganda,My boss had me order this for him and his friends. Completely almost baseless conjecture from an academic's point of view. No more note worth than Michael Moore from the other side of the fence
1,Wow... Really?,"This ""film"" collects together nearly all of the conspiracy garbage floated by the right wing wacko patrol. To be more accurate the title should replace the word ""Story"" with ""Fantasy"". I'm betting that this load of fertilizer was vetted and approved by the people that brought us legitimate rape, a 9000 year old earth, and dinosaurs being contemporary to man. It cost too much at free, I should have been paid to watch it."
1,This is libelous and full of lies.,"This piece of filth should not even be sold on Amazon. Lies, lies and more lies. It's a free country and people can say what they want, but America doesn't have to read it. Don't."
1,"Dishonest, shabby, low class gutter trash",The allegations made in this film have been destroyed by the excellent research of attorney Loren Collins in Atlanta. Since when did it become acceptable in American society to smear and slander the President's MOTHER? Especially when all Gilbert offers is lies based on his warped imagination? This piece of trash shouldn't be sold by Amazon. You're rolling in the gutter with human garbage.
1,Trash,Shame on Amazon for even putting this on their website. The story is close enought to the real facts to make some believe it is true. It is in fact TRASH.
1,Sources?,"Documentary making is journalism, and in order to be taken seriously you need to cite your sources. Which this attempt at documentary making did not even attempt to do. What you have here is basically is contrived fantasy."
5,"Shocking, Exposé Video that Obama is a Deceptive Socialist Marxist, Communist. Beware, America For Your Freedoms","Just as I have expected, Obama is a life-long groomed & deceptive Socialist, Marxist, Communist in sheepskin clothing that is easily seen through from his overt Presidential actions.Are the reasons for WW2 in Germany, their Final Solution, going to repeat themselves???Who owns & runs everything that counts in this country, deceptively? It looks like Obama supports all of that & all of that supports him !!!"
1,Unbelievable - in every sense of the word.,"Racist, Sleazy, Silly Bunk -- and that is the kindest review I can give!The form forces you to give a rating of at least 1 star or I would not have done."
5,There ya go..,"You know that 90% of this is right on. Do the math and reserch it yourself. You will find 90% of this is fact. Now whether or not Obama is evil or not is the narrators opinion. But I would say he is a product of his up bringing, friends and relationships. Look into it. He knows everyone of these people. He did all of these things. Only time will tell. But even without any of this. How has he done on revitalizing America? I say the damage is done. So..... how long to fix us now? A lot longer then 4 years. And.... Not by Obama.. Yup. That's my opinion"
1,Reheated McCarthyism,"I received this as a DVD in the mail recently. It was made by a film production company whose other titles include: ""Elvis Found Alive"", and ""Paul McCartney is Dead"". Need I say more? It is insulting to an intelligent person. And, it should be instructive that over 1.5 million of these DVDs have been mailed to voters in swing states. The sad thing is, there are enough people who don't bother checking facts that a certain percentage will believe and be afraid, be very afraid, of Obama."
5,The socialist timeline in America,"This film documents the socialist conquest of America. Whether Obama is the son of Frank Marshall Davis or not, the history of the totalitarian movement they both dedicated their lives to is an American tragedy that must be seen and understood by all Americans. This film does that.We may never find out who Obama's real father is, and while this is certainly a hook used to draw people into the film, Gilbert convincingly, persuasively, and conclusively documents the movement in which both Obama, Davis, and a large cast of other operators moved, and continue to move, the socialist agenda forward in America.It's an essential thread of knowledge that all American's must know as soon as possible. The battle may be already lost."
5,Dreams from My Real Father,If you don't get an aha moment from watching this video you are not paying attention to the facts. It's time Americans woke up to the fact that the Communist Party USA has bamboozled us with a fake president. Our constitutional republic has been usurped by criminals. Pay attention!Thanks to Joel Gilbert for researching the truth.
1,Conspiracy Theory Fiction,"This ""film"" is nothing but right wing conspiracy theory. There is no fact in it and it has been debunked by the news Media. I am surprised that Amazon would offer this king of trash. Perhaps Amazon is the wrong place for me to spend my money."
1,Wow...,Horrible fictitious account of Barack Obama's life. Mockumentary highlights. Barack's mom was a whore who is probably into BDSM. Barack is still a Muslim because he said a Musim prayer when he was a kid. He is also a Communist trying to bring about Socialism in the US.It's a sick sad piece of fiction.
5,Globalist puppet using the communist agenda.,At the top communist do the job of the international globalist like the neocons. Both use fake tactics to control and manipulate the masses for there own political (wealth) gains and transfer trillions to offshore international corporations owned by the real super elite that fund both sides of the extreme political party's.
4,Interesting,Very interesting and informative. Some presented items actuallly shocked me. Since the author was not sued (to my knowledge) or the dvd or book withdrawn...I have to assume his facts were correct. Very interesting.
5,A MUST WATCH FOR EVERY TRUE AMERICAN,"My friend and I just watched ""Dreams From My Real Father"" and were amazed at the documented research regarding the many puzzling questions about the background of this president that were finally answered clearly. All the loose ends concerning his early life were brought together in a way that makes very convincing sense. It shows the dangerous path we are on if the clueless voters give him and his henchmen four more years to destroy America as it was founded. We will never recover our freedom."
1,Treason,"The idiots who get their opinions from Foxnews are now beginning to talk treason. My disgust knows no bounds. When I and all my gay friends were getting sick and dying of AIDS, and President Reagan didn't say or do anything, we were outraged, but we never, ever dared to go as far as these idiots. And what exactly are they so furious about? taxes? spending? The economy is recovering just fine, in spite of their efforts to bring down the president and block the recovery. Shouldn't they be angry at the president who got us into this horrible pickle? Their elected village idiot, W. He will go down in history as the Stupidest president ever.Meanwhile, the world gave Barack Obama a Nobel Prize. Maybe, just maybe, the world is right and you are wrong, mr & Mrs White Trash racist trailer dweller and the evil billionaires who are brainwashing them.Civil War is coming and it'll be over nothing, and it'll be fox news and stupid people's fault."
4,Dreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception,One of the greatest frauds perpetrated on the American people. Must see this video!If you thought you understood Obama you need to see this video. You will understand his motives.
1,Racist trash peddled by the insane,Birtherism combined with character slurs against the President's mother. No sane person would recommend this trash. This is about as low as it gets.
1,Unmitigated poppycock!,"This is some of the worst nonsense I have ever seen. There is not a particle of truth in it from beginning to end. The facts about President Obama's father are better supported than those of almost any candidate in the past century. While I can understand that there are people who produce this kind of ""fairy tale"" in the hope of a moment's fame, I cannot comprehend why anyone would be taken in by it."
1,Ridiculous and racist,I would give this ZERO stars if Amazon allowed me to do so. I am APPALLED that Amazon would sell a product so obviously intended to defame the President. He is the PRESIDENT. It is absolutely ridiculous that these lies continue to be spread. Just ridiculous.
2,Almost as bad as Michael Moore,"Only the willfully gullible would regard this as a reliable reconstruction of the Obama story. I've read the one-star reviews, though, and looked in vain for a decisive refutation of the claim that the Dunham family lived in Lebanon during the 1950's. That claim is oddly pivotal, though, because it runs entirely counter to the narrative about Gramps being merely an oddly peripatetic furniture salesman. So I give this two stars, instead of one, because it left me with the sense that the many lacuna in the Obama biography are intentional, and that the orthodox narrative likely embodies some intentional falsehoods."
1,More Delusions From Right-Wing Fantasyland,"Gilbert's claims are pure hogwash! There is no evidence that Obama's mother ever met Davis, much less that they were intimate. Further, Gilbert's delusions are epitomized by his claim that Obama's grandfather was a CIA agent. For a detailed analysis of the disinformation campaign against the Davis-Obama relationship, please Google ""Disinformation Against The Obama-Davis Relationship (10 April 2011)"""
4,Bam Bam,"It is to late for the election, but everyone should see this anyway. It is a same it wasn't shown at theaters before the election."
1,Makes for a great coaster when turned upside down,I rate this film 1/2 a star below the toilet paper that gets stuck on your feet on the way out of the bathroom... the kind that you're afraid to touch with your own hands yet so desperately try to separate from your shoe in other way possible. Absolute artificial filth.
5,Oh What a Lie We've Been Told!,"First of all, DNA DOES NOT LIE. Second, Obama should win an Academy Award for BEST FICTION!!!! ""....my father was a goatherd from Kenya...."" Everyone should see this film."
1,STOP BEING BRAINWASHED BY FAR RIGHT CORPORATE AGENDA,"I've never in my life seen a time where people have the temerity to attack the PRESIDENT of the United States with such DISRESPECT, DISDAIN, and RACISM. I'm appalled as an American. I wish people would EDUCATE THEMSELVES and stop allowing for themselves to be BRAINWASHED by Teaparty rhetoric. Obama has more integrity, more heart, and more courage than many other presidents we have had.. the only reason the Teatards are against him is because he fights EVERY DAY to ensure that the Far-Right Corporate agenda can no longer get away with their greedy, cheating ways!!! and yet, you demonize him.. guess who else in history was so demonized during his lifetime?? JESUS. WAKE UP and educate yourselves from LEGITIMATE sources people."
1,A horrid waste of bandwidth,"In the interest of full disclosure, I lean more liberal than conservative. However, I pride myself in getting my news from all sources and trying to understand the thought processes that lead to some of the more...interesting extreme political views. To that end, I watched this movie when I saw it was available. Or rather, I tried to. I tried really hard, but it was so lacking in factual depth or any semblance of objectivity that I had to turn it off ten minutes into it. It doesn't matter where you politics lay, you'll regret every second of time you waste watching this movie. Watch something better, like paint drying."
1,"If you paid anything for this DVD, you got cheated","I recently was amongst millions of individuals to receive an unsolicited copy of this DVD directly from the distributor at no cost. I got what I paid for, zero. This work of conspiratorial propaganda may have some value: The mailing costs likely helped the financially strapped US Postal Service. This mass giveaway certainly leaves legitimate for-profit vendors -- like Amazon.com -- at least somewhat betrayed and in the lurch. This is silliness without substance. Chalk another one up to the lowest common denominator."
1,Lies and more lies !,"This is a down right lie. The republican party has tried to discredit our President with this false information. For those who have read the book called ""Dreams From My Father"" you would know this documentary Dreams From My Real Father is a lie. The American public will not be dismay with the likes of this crap. God is watching."
1,Basically propaganda,"Some filmmaker attempts a conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. Not only is this factually inaccurate, but it requires the viewer to suspend reality and join ranks with the paranoid birther crowd. 0/10"
4,Thought provoking,"There were a lot of possibilities proposed in this video that, considering what we have learned, are very plausible. People need to realize this is not presented as documented fact but as a theory with a lot of facts backing up the theory. I would have liked to have seen references showing us where a lot of the suggestions came from, such as the suggestion that Stanley Dunham was CIA. It can be hard to know which parts are fact based and which parts are suggested theory. However, it's definitely worth the watch and thought provoking, either way."
1,Propaganda,"It starts with the premise .... and on it goes. I am sure that these days the authors/directors believe something but spew out the opposite of it just because of what makes them popular/gets money .... they are no cuckoos, just methodical."
1,And Bigfoot Wins Babysitter of the Year,"Like his other videos, Elvis Found Alive and Paul McCartney Really Is Dead, Joel Gilbert has concocted another 100% fictional piece of junk to fuel the nuts who want to delegitimize a strong president. That an individual peddles these conspiracy fallacies is one thing but that someone other than his mother believes a word of it highlights the sad state part of our country is in. The good news? An oddity like this works in an unintended way; it further compartmentalizes the radicals who perpetuate such paltry myths."
1,Seriously?,It bothers me that in this day and age in America people are willing to believe such baseless propaganda. It's nothing but slander and fear tactics! It sickens me.
1,Seriously?,"This ""film"" is so off-the-charts crazy, it speaks for itself. It almost seems to be an SNL parody. I can't imagine the filmmaker actually subscribes to his argument. He strikes me as someone who has found a niche market of crazy resentment and is exploiting it to make a tidy profit."
1,Ignorance on Parade,"Amateurishly assembled, simple-minded racist claptrap, or an elaborate joke? If the former, what's even more depressing than the content is that people buy it as objective and fact-based. (If there's an actual fact here, I missed it.) If the latter, Joel Gilbert must be laughing up his sleeve at anyone who watched this all the way through and still took it seriously. The lowlights are many -- my personal fave is the comparison of facial features. I kept waiting for the narrator (a bad impression of the president) to say ""Negroid.""Gilbert has inadvertently proved one right-wing allegation: The 200+ 5-star reviews here show that the country's educational system is indeed a shambles."
1,For the Gullible,"Offensive use of media to enrage the ignorant. There is nothing credible about this film. It is typical political extremism and if you or any of your cohorts believe this, you are already sadly misinformed. Find a legitimate source of information and start over."
1,Baseless,Arent you all tired of the baseless lies and B.S.? If you don't like the guy's policies - talk about the policies! You don't need to fabricate a backstory for your delusional story.
5,An eye opener,"Wow! Although I hated the narration, the music and the style in which this film was done, it was very, very good. A lot of information to make you think. Watch it!"
2,Typical Gilbert fare,"Joel Gilbert specializes in ""hoax"" videos. Whether it's claiming he's found Elvis alive or claiming that Paul McCartney is really dead (two other recent Gilbert DVD's you can purchase) his flicks are always well-edited, slick, in very poor taste and generally made with the express purpose of riling people up. Whatever your feelings about the President are, I wouldn't exactly trust the information being presented here. It's assembled well and it's a step up production-wise from his Paul Is Dead video but the real entertainment value in Gilbet's work is in watching people online get all hot and bothered over it. I'm seeing a lot of reviews from people on the right who've taken this thing seriously and some very disturbing responses from people on the left who swear the GOP is behind this. I've got news for ya. You've both been had....but maybe that was the point after all."
5,More evidence that the American media is NOT doing their job!,"This is a very captivating, well done documentary. I have heard Mr. Joel Gilbert speak on the radio and have watched, ""Dreams of My REAL Father"" and found the information to be insightful, well documented and investigated. The film deserves to be viewed by all who are genuinely concerned about the integrity and future of our country. The media in this country is largely responsible for where we find ourselves today. They do not show the whole picture regarding our president or any other issue of concern to most Americans. I appreciate Mr. Gilbert's time and efforts. He is an American that is concerned and has taken his own time to educate the rest of us. You will want to share it with your family/friends.I asked my father (65 y/o) what he thought after watching it. He took a deep breath and shook his head and said, ""Why haven't I heard any of this before?"". That's a VERY good question!"
5,WAKE UP AMERICA,"Well researched and logically presented film. Shows Obama mentored by a well known Communist party leader since the age of 10. Obama's mother totally nude picture taken at the home of this black Communist in Hawaii is shown in the film.Don't know if this Communist was his father,but certain that Obama was mentored by this man. Obama even confirms this fact in his autobiography. White America had better wake up.The Democrats have being flooding America with third world people over the last 40 years who have no education,no money,and hate the white man.They will vote for anything Obama does so long as he gives them some free goodies.Of course, Obama will rob you with high taxes to pay for these bribes while he destroys our country."
1,Trash- disregard unless you are a birther,"Typical wing-nut anti-Obama screed. Crazy distribution of ratings tells you everything you need to know about this polarizing nonsense. If you are into that sort of thing, enjoy. Rational Americans can skip it."
1,Ridiculous...,"I really can't believe THIS is what Amazon has decided to offer its Prime members for free...While I generally think their selections are spot on, this ""work"" is nothing but right-wing hysteria, dressed up to look like a serious documentary. I truly feel sorry for people that can't or won't see the difference, I really do.Come on Amazon, you're better than this!"
