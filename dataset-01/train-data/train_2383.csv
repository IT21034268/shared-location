4,First Single is Misleading,"Yellowcard is trying to be darker. Well, a couple of tracks have harder guitar riffs, but overall they are still doing the same punk rock from before. Lights and Sounds is easily the best track and obviously the hardest.The rest of the songs seem to blend together slightly. But don't get me wrong, the songs are all good. It's just finding a great song that is hard. On Ocean Avenue, you could easily take about 5 or 6 songs and say they are fantastic, but with Lights and Sounds, it's harder.But, the good thing about this CD, is that the step in a harder direction definitely suits Yellow. You'll still miss the catchy song Ocean Avenue, but the band's maturing in the right direction.Overall this CD is good, but not great. Ocean Avenue is a better CD in all, but that doesn't change the fact that Lights and Sounds is good."
2,Its okay. not so great.,whew....not as good as the first album. some songs are good and most are not. most of the songs is like blah blah blah and a punch of tunes jammed together which sounds like gumbo soup. i like yellowcard but not their new album. i would just burn songs that i like from them................
1,foo fighters without the foo,"I would say that they are completely talentless, but the guy who plays the electric fiddle in the music video for ""Lights and Sounds"" at least appears like he knows how to play an instrument."
1,Yay Preeeeety lights,"WTF This C.D and the song that shares its namesake sucks. His vocals are crappy and often off-key, his voice cracks, and personally I wish I could gouge either my ears or his mouth out, possibly even both. This was the biggest waste of money ever and I hope the violinist goes insane and beats every single one of them to death.Flame courtesy of : Poopear - WTF is up with my name -(It's German, no not really you dumb s.o.b)"
3,Stop Turn Take A Look Around...,"Good,but not what i was expecting.It's very fresh, totaly different from ""ocean ave"" that's for sure. Lots of slow songs and not enough fast ones. This doesn't complment their live shows.""Lights and Sounds, Rough landing, Holly and Holly Wood Died"" are best, It has more of a rock feel but it's yellowcard.good job but it could of been one of the album's of 2006."
3,Not quite the ultimate guide.,"This book should really be titled: ""Porsche: Another Guide--A Few Things You Might Need to Know About Every Porsche Ever Built."" It is probably true that every Porsche is listed, but the details are far far too thin to live up to its title."
3,Good tale set in the world of U.S. government/Indian relations,"In not a huge fan of ""Indian country"" mysteries (as another Amazon reviewer described the genre), but I enjoyed ""Sky Woman Falling"" well enough. You get a somewhat unusual mystery scenario and learn, quite painlessly, about the many issues facing modern American Indian tribes in the United States. Interestingly, you don't just learn about how the U.S. government relates to Indians these days, but how various Indian tribes feel about and relate to each other. And, so you don't feel totally at sea if you're new to this genre, you also get that great old mystery/thriller staple: friction between federal and local law enforcement. Like a thunderstorm during the climactic showdown, that particular staple never gets old."
3,Interesting but uneven,"Although the plot of this mystery kept me interested, I didn't get a sense of the personalities of the two main characters. I thought that the biggest ""secret"" of the mystery was fairly easy to guess. The method of murder was ingenious but overcomplicated, and there wasn't really a good explanation why that method was used."
4,Works as promised,Radios range is only the optimum possible which will never happen in real life. This is the same for all the radios sold not just this brand or model.Battery runtime could be longer but then the radios would be bigger too so it is a trade-off. The recharge base is convenient as a stand so you can find them when needed.Reception and sound quality are good when used correctly - kids like to talk too loud and too close to the handset which cause garble. Keep them a couple of inches away from your mouth and speak in a normal tone and they sound great.These are a good value and I would buy them again if needed.
2,At most 1/2 a mile in subarban area,"Pros: It looks cool, has a charger, and does not cost much (29.99).Cons: The range is VERY low."
1,14 MILES?,"I TRIED USING THESE RADIOS ON A SUBURBAN SETTING AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET 1/2 MILE RANGE AT BEST, MAYBE THEY WORK BETTER OUT IN THE COUNTRY WITH NO OBSTRUCTIONS (SUCH AS HOUSES), ALSO THE TALK TIME OF THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED (1 HOUR ON AVERAGE) STANDBY TIME IS BETTER,MORE THAN 4 HOURS ON AVERAGE. IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I WOULD NOT BUY THE UNIDEN FOR HALF THE PRICE."
5,Easy and useful,"I purchased 10 sets of these to use in a very large crowded ballroom type setting. We need to be able to contact people beyond the ballroom, anywhere on the premises. They were easy to set up and set to a common channel. All 20 people figured out how to use them within seconds. They were ideal for this situation. Good product."
1,Had a month and already don't work!!!,I have had these radios for just a month and now you can't keep them on charge. I bought them for my store employees to use when they needed each other they could call. Batteries die in less than 8 hours. Now after a month you can't get them to charge. I guess you get what you buy. I thought they were a good brand. I always heard Uniden was good. Not so on this occasion. I will spend the extra money next time to get something that will last. Not a good buy!!!
3,Not our favorite wooden puzzle,"Bought this puzzle with the Safari and the Farm ones as well. They are so well done I'm sure they will last a long time. The only problem I have with this one, and not with the others, is all the ""cars / trucks"" seem to be the same to me, obviously they are not, but it's hard to explain the difference to a 17 month old between a cement truck and a sand truck, whatever their names are... So out of the three I bought he hasn't wanted to play with this one at all yet. Probably when he gets older..."
2,Not Like The Old Melissa and Doug Chunky Puzzles,"We have several Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles that my son loves, so we ordered this one to add to the collection. Sadly, this particular puzzle (and the dinosaur one) are not the same quality as other puzzles in the series. The older chunky puzzles have an image painted on each piece. Even the back and sides of each piece are painted in primary colors. The newer chunky puzzles are pressed wood cut outs with raw (and somewhat rough) edges and backsides with decals stuck on the front. My son is still teething and sticks everything in his mouth. Within five minutes of opening this puzzle the decals are already coming off. For a product that is supposedly hand made, it is shoddy. Be warned, this is not like the older version of this puzzle!"
1,Dangerous toy!!! Please Read!,"My son (2 years old.. so within their recommended age range) received this and another Melissa & Doug puzzle for his birthday. He loves all things trucks, and construction, so how appropriate right? WRONG! We opened them together and IMMEDIATELY pieces of sharp particle board started splintering off the backs of the pieces as they were taken apart. I thought maybe it was just the initial splitting of the pieces until I cut MY foot open on a sliver from the back of one of the puzzle pieces another day. My foot bled quite a bit, and the wound took quite a while to heal. I would NEVER recommend these puzzles for ANY age group. If my son had cut himself, heads would have rolled. I put in a call to the company, no response yet. Please please please do not let your children play with these. It's not worth it!"
5,Great for little ones!,"My 16 month old loves these puzzles. With thinner puzzle pieces she struggles to slide them into the correct spot, but with these she can grasp them pretty easily and it lessens the frustration. Just enough pieces to hold their attention but not be too overwhelming. I also like that on the puzzle board there is an actual picture of the piece where the piece goes. These are my favorite puzzles for 1-3 yrs."
4,Great for my 2 Year Old!,"My son has played with this puzzle for about 4 months and its held up very well. The paint on the pieces is doing great, and the educational value is there. We get to differentiate the different types of trucks and the purpose of each one. I would recommend this puzzle."
5,Great puzzles!,"My son has three of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles. He has this one, the one with the bugs, and the zoo animal puzzle. He loves all three. At first he just enjoyed taking the pieces out but now he has started to try to put the pieces back in. I love that these puzzles are brightly colored, durable, and attractive. I haven't noticed the paint coming off of them if he puts them in his mouth and he hasn't been able to destroy them when teething either! Great puzzles!"
3,just ok,"It's been hit and miss with chunky puzzles, me, and Amazon. This one is a miss. This sides and back are unpainted. When put together it is cute, but my son always goes for the puzzles with the ""all over paint job"" first. I have since seen this puzzle in a store with the other kind of pieces. I love Amazon, but I will no longer buy this style puzzle from here. There's no way to know which style you will receive."
2,Whiter not Brighter,I bought this to replace stock lights on my mazda mpv which were getting weaker. This one produced a somewhat whiter light but not any brighter than my 6 year old stock headlights. So it didn't serve my purpose and but at this price not too much of a loss.
5,Very happy customer!,Very beautiful watch from a respected company. Even more attractice in person. Very nice packaging and fast free shipping during the holiday. Couldn't even find it in the stores but got it in just a couple of days in the mail.
5,Secrets of Sucessful Golf - Balard V3,"Thank a lot for my purhase. All is alwright in time and the chipping was without trouble. The Video is correct and it's fun. PL(i have already record this title with the next programmation page, next year. It's not right !)"
4,Babbitt's Dhammapada,"Babbitt's translation of the Dhammapada is still luminous and inspiring, but his instroduction, unfortunately, is not only unenlightening about the nature of Buddhism, but is filled with topical references that are now hopelessly dated. I highly recommend Babbitt's translation of this key Buddhist text, but I would advise the reader to skip the introduction and read a more comprehensive history of Buddhism by a recognized authority such as Max Muller, T. W. Rhys Davids, Daisetz Suzuki or Christmas Humphries."
1,Malfunction Junction,"I got one of these clocks as a Christmas gift... then I got another to replace the defective one. Then I dismantled both to create one that wasn't screwed up. The first one couldn't be mounted because when they manufactured it, the mounting holes were reversed and upside down. The second one had one of the hour hands misplaced so on the hour, the our hand was between the hours. I tried to pull the clock face out but it was glued, so I took one off the hinges and replaced the entire clock unit with one from the first clock... only the first clock ended up having the entire clock face mounted and glued at an angle so when mounted on the wall, the clock face was angled to the left. I ended up breaking the glue with a steak knife and removing the clock from the bracket in order to reinstall it correctly. Had it not been a gift, people at the local landfill would certainly know what time it is!"
2,Very Basic,"This trimmer is so lightweight it's flimsy. It has no stand to hold it while charging, and the comb apparatus looks and feels pretty delicate. This is a very basic unit that cuts so fast and close it's a little hard to control when beard trimming. The head is also too wide for detail work."
5,Great Beard Trimmer,"Bought to replace a Remington MB50 that had a psychotic battery after only 2 years. This Panasonice is much better. Quieter, cuts my beard more evenly, and being new, cuts it better. It is wider, but still easy to manage. Lighter and you can use it while plugged in. I understand the type of battery Panasonic uses is more reliable and has fewer memory issues than the type used by Remington."
5,Panasonic ER206K,"I have owned this panasonic trimmer for few years. I primarily use it to cut my hair. Even though its supposed to be a beard/moustache trimer, it works great on my hair. For years now it has been working great, and the battery still holds a very good charge. Panasonic is the brand i go for first. I have never been disappointed by their products."
5,Great Product,"There's not much to say, it works like it's suppose to. I would buy another one when the time comes, but that should be a while."
4,simple,"This doesn't get easier. Turn the dial for length, turn on or off. The top pops off for cleaning and the battery lasts forever. My last one (Remington I think) would only last a week charged sitting around, but this one lasted for more than a month, I used it, and it still has a charge."
2,Too Large,Works fine cutting the beard but hard to do mustache because the cutting head is too large... I sent mine back...
2,A BASIC HUMOR PROCESS BY ROBERT LATTA,"THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TO DESTROY THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF INCONGRUITY RESOLUTION AS THE CAUSE OF JOKES CAUSING LAUGHTERBUT THE TEXT IS VERY CAUTIOUS, LABOURED AND DENSE BEING ALMOST AS BAD AS SCHOPENHAUR TO FOLLOW ."
3,It will do the job.,"This product is a little smaller and made of lighter materials than the one I purchased 8 years ago, but it will do the job. I doubt that I'll get 8 years out of this one, but at the price as long as it last a couple of years it will be worth it. I like the design because it holds a lot of clothes in a small space."
1,Dirty and Rusty,When I opened the package the product was dirty and rusty! It was to the point where I did not want to touch it and just threw the whole thing away. It was unusable!
4,well built,This is an excellent clothes stand. Assembled it is a sturdy stand that should give many years of use.Assembly is no problem requiring only a screwdriver. The hook & eye stabilizers seem better than the folding rod w/rivets that had a tendency to break.This is a good price and was shipped quickly.
1,Poorly made and not as described,"The Folding Caddy sold by Get Organized was very poorly made and not at all like described in the product details. The item I received does not fold, is not very sturdy and would only hold a third of the number of garments claimed. I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not recommend it to anyoneAddendum to the above review:After posting the above comments I was contacted by Get Organized and offered a refund of the purchase. The representative who called was very polite and apologetic vis-à-vis my dissatisfaction with their product. While I would still not recommend this particular item I would still consider ordering from Get Organized again in the future."
3,Caddy,"Not the best, but it does work. It is a pain to put together. I wish there were alternatives to this, but this is the best out there right now."
1,junk,Came smashed in the mail as it wasn't packaged very good. So couldn't use it and had to return it.
4,Very nice,"I truly didn't expect this from Horner. He wrote an original score including some of his signature cues such as the military drum beat racing before being accentuated by the clang of a bell. His beautiful string work is prominent in the main theme. Some tracks are tense underscore with shrilling trumpets.Film reviewers have complained about the ""overbearing"" music in the movie. Not having seen it, it's of no concern to me. It's a fine listen on its own and a nice change from Horner after some, in the opinion of many, unoriginal recent works.Check out THE LEGEND OF ZORRO and THE CHUMSCRUBBER as some of his finer, recent works!"
1,All the King's Men,"What a great disappointment, and a waste of money.I felt as though I was listening to the same measuresof music over and over. This was neither enjoyablenor inspiring. It was just monotonous and tiresome.Fortunately, it is short, which you wouldn't want ifyou were enjoying it."
3,Usual Wiggles,We purchased this DVD for our son and it was an instant favorite as he was a big Wiggles fan at the time. If your kids like Wiggles go ahead and get it - it will at the very least give you something different to watch!
3,Not as much Wiggly fun as other videos,"It's hard to articulate what is different about this video, but the songs aren't as catchy, the skits aren't as clever, and generally, the wit and whimsy of other videos (Top of the Tots, Hoop-do-Doo) is lacking. However, it IS the Wiggles so there are always a catchy song or two, but overall it's rather short and uneven and the Wiggles do much better when they present themselves as a variety show not as musical actors. Hope this helps!"
2,Disappointed,"We are big Wiggle's fans, but this was a big let down. The music and the movie is no where near as good as the television shows on the Disney Channel. I think we will stick with the Disney channel."
4,Fun for everyone!,Your kids will enjoy this if they loved Finding Nemo - also take time to check out Captain Jon Explores the Ocean on DVD (also Available from Amazon)
3,This could have been great!,"This Wiggle movie has the potential to be great but it falls short. Very short. The story makes little sense. The story is in no way coherent like Magical Adventure. Wiggle Bay seems like it should be located in Wiggle World and not Australia( when did the Wiggles move to Australia?!). Henry seems thrown into each scene as an afterthought. It makes no sense that Dorothy is helping with the clues and not the Captain. Where in heck did the wiggly dancers come from, why are they there, and does anyone else find them annoying as heck?(...) This is not the Wiggles my son has grown to love. The movie had the potential to be great (what kid doesn't like a treasure hunt), but it fails on every level."
2,Perhaps their worst??????,"Very diappointed with this video. My 2 year old daughter was bored watching this video. The ""new"" songs sounded like old songs redone. The dancing was uninspiring and where are the children that are always in the Wiggles videos????? Perhaps the most disappointing thing was the plug at the end of the video for Wiggles merchandise."
3,This is our first wiggle dvd,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter likes to sing and dance, but she really didn't get into this. The songs were'nt bad, but I just wasn't that impressed after hearing so much about the wiggles."
5,19 month old granddaughter plays this all day long,The wiggeles for some reason attract the attention of little ones. My oldest granddaughter is 9 now and she loved them . All the wiggles we had were on tapes. They can be played in the extra bedroom on the vcr. But amazon let me order dvd's at a low price to play on the living room dvd player.Kelsey will watch the wiggies as she calls them over and over again.
5,CLASSIC,"Lee has two solo albums out, I find them both to be superb. After leaving Mike Morgan & The Crawl, I didn't think he would do this well, what a great surprise. I like both of them about the same, nice gritty vocals and classic Mcbee harp. His song writing skills are still very sharp, these are a bunch of great tunes. He also has a fantastic band behind him, both of these are very much worth picking up."
4,I like it,I have seen this group perform twice in KC. I have always enjoyed their work and this album takes me right back to those events.
2,Wouldn't Buy it Again,"It gets the job done, good for airpland travel but that's about it! I don't have too much good to say about this product. The screen is so small only 2 people can watch it. The sound is horrible, couldn't hear it in the car traveling with the volume turned all the way up and it's a little bulky for how small it is. Certainly not worth anything more than $40.00. Unfortunately we paid $60 for it when it was on sale but if I had to do all over again I would have invested more money into something larger and better. Take my advice and don't get this, find a different one."
4,Weight Loss anyone?,"One thing I like about Simontacchi's book is that in addition to adiscussion of Chitosan, she includes a discussion of carnitine as anadditional fat metabolizer. According to the directions on theChitosan bottle...I take two to four capsules aboutone half an hour before meals. I'm feeling skinnier and am finallyreceiving comments from friends about whether I have lost weight ornot. Yippee. I haven't felt any side effects from the Chitosan andam also taking the carnitine and Co-Q10 for a healthy heart...."
5,BRIGHT DIFFERENCE!,"These sturdy file folders stand out, helping me organize my papers in a distinctive way. The neon colors are great!"
3,beware the color!,"the image isn't even close to the colors. the true colors could wake the dead -- not at all like the image, checked on three different monitors. bleah!"
5,Must read for teachers!,"Carla gives a simple, yet in-depth description of how the brain works and how we learn. She also talks about Brain-Gym (R), another topic worthy of looking into, especially for people with learning disabilities but also for helping anyone learn more effectively."
3,A fine place to start...,"I purchased this book a while back and read it. It incorporates brain gym and provides explanation of why these techniques work. For me, it was a step back...I have a child with learning problems that Brain Gym assists with...however, by the time I read the book, I had already had courses in Brain Gym, attended a lecture and met Paul Denison (Brain gym founder), & it offered little information for me. I would, however, recommend it for people who are wanting to dabble a bit and get a basic understanding. If you are more familiar with Brain Gym, I do not think you will find this book very informative; you probably know it already."
5,Perfect remedy for a sedentary generation!,"As many of the other reviews suggest, this book should be required reading for parents and educators. First of all, the explanations of the mechanics of the brain are very well presented for a lay audience--very easy to understand. The neuroscientific explanation then lays the groundwork for the thesis that Hannaford presents--that we need to consider the impact of the body and movement on the development of the brain. This book is a great step forward for holistic modes of education.Power Brain Kids"
3,BrainGym Works!,"I've been doing BrainGym exercises for the last 8 months and have enjoyed a marked improvement in my general coordination, and my ability to focus and handle stress. Hanniford's book, while often too technical for my untrained mind, helped me to understand the ""Why's"" behind the method. As will all BrainGym-related books, however, ""Smart Moves"" could benefit from the talents of an astute editor and a proficient illustrator."
4,easy and happy:,The sender fulfilled my expectation: via efficient mailing and quality of book.will use again. Smart Moves arrived in good shape and on time.
2,wrong cover,The cover we recieved was not the one pictured and therefor did not fit the truck seat. It also has a spot that was a hole from the seam not being sewed properly.
3,Hmm... Good.,The best thing about this book is the number of puzzles is large enough to last a long time. It's good value for money. Good timepass (tp) when one has spare time.
2,More of the same . . .,"Being a fan of Cesar, I expected something new and informative.This DVD is nothing more than a bunch of selected episodes from his series. So, if you already have his episodes on DVD, don't buy this, unless you want the aggression-specific episodes on one disk."
1,Not again,"Seriously, this guy is not even an educated trainer. He has harmed so many dogs and uneducated owners who just want to help their animals. Please educate yourself, even the AVMA has spoken out against him."
4,Helpful!,"This DVD has very practical information for dog owners. It really got me thinking about the way a dog thinks. It is fantastic that a lot of the hyper dogs were helped by long and tiresome walks. Sometimes I leave it on for the dog now since I have watched it many times and know it by heart. My dog likes the barking and hearing people. It gives him some stimulation, but I think he needs a new DVD he is bored with this one already."
1,Not enough Information 5,"We returned this item. We had already ordered the complete 1st and 2nd Seasons. This DVD was full of Highlights of the 1st Season. Had we known this we would have spared Amazon the shipping costs both ways. As far as Cesar Millan is concerned, he is amazing. I would recommend thisseries to anyone who dosen't want to order the complete series."
4,"Loved it, made me think!","It is an abridged version, which is my only negative. It gave me great information on how to grow and understand my dog. I only wish I could read my dog as well as he reads my own feeling. Now when I see my dogs acting sad or not themselves instead of thinking what is wrong with them I think how am I out of balance. Excercise Discipline Affection really work miracles, after two weeks people could tell the difference. I also enjoyed the fact that it was read by Cesar Milan."
1,Just plain bad advice...,The advice is just clearly wrong.What is really strange is when the video just aburtly cuts off when he makes a mistakes and a horrible dog fight erupts.The editing shows this again and again.....it cuts and re-starts with all the humans and dogs looking frazzled.
2,Depends on what you want,"If you want to see Mr. Milan demonstrate his personal rapport with animals, this DVD will fill the bill. However, if you are seeking advice and instruction on how to overcome aggression in your pet, this DVD will not be of much help. The DVD is really nothing but an infommercial praising Mr. Milan's talents. I seriously doubt that the dogs he works with in the DVD maintain their non-aggressive behavior after he leaves. The strategies he uses, such as having the aggressive dog walk beside his non-aggressive pack dog, are not practical for the average dog owner. If someone were going to hire Mr. Milan as a personal dog trainer, this item would certainly serve as a recommendation, but it is woefully lacking as step-by-step instruction on how to overcome aggression in a dog."
5,Aggression Problems Solved,"I was having problems with my 2 six month old West Highland White Terriers. I had no idea the problems had to do with them thinking they were the leaders of the pack! (they were pulling on the leash, snarling at me when I touched their paws, fighting over food dish, and fighting between the two of them continuously). Within 5 days of viewing the video on aggression and putting Cesar's recommendations into practice, I had two completely different dogs. Thank you Cesar!"
5,The dog whisperer,The Dog Whisperer always has a great shows. I would recommend this video collection. It wasdelivered right away. I bought the videos for a friend.
2,Not at all what I expected,"Perhaps for some reason my experience with this product was unusual, but I was quite disappointed. I left the covers in place for well over the recommended time, yet saw no results at all. There was no moisturizing effect, no reduction in dryness. I hope others have a better experience with the product."
1,Two hour toy,"Be warned, if you buy this water slide it might not make it through the first day of use. When we hooked ours up to the garden hose for the sprinkler on top, the air chamber below filled with water and the seam blew out - when we tried to get a new one all we could get was the run around from INTEX, Amazon, and Windy City Super Store. All of them sell it but nobody backs it up when there is a problem."
1,Deflated after 1 use!,"I wouldn't waste money on this slide. We used it one time for an hour with a few elementary-age children and then deflated it. The next time we blew it up, it deflated within no time. We had a previous slide and got 3 years worth of use, and this slide only lasted one day. I am very disappointed with its quality, esp. for the price. I was doubtful with the negative reviews I read and went ahead to purchase it, but buyer beware."
2,Fun at first but seams will rip easily.,"I actually purchased two of these slides as the kids were very excited after blowing up the first one and I decided to purchase another for a gift for a neighbor. However, they both ripped in two weeks, in multiple places. They rip easily at the seams making them unpatchable. If you plan to use it once (birthday party, etc.) it's an excellent alternative to renting a large slide but don't expect it to last more than a couple of weeks."
2,intex pool slide,"I read all of the reviews before buying and was warned, but I bought it anyway. The slide was a blast for a few days, UNTIL it sprang a leak and then it was just a pain. Good idea, but very poor quality product."
5,Excellent Water Slide,"Purchased for use during summer in Las Vegas. Stayed in the sun all summer. It was used constantly for 5 weeks, till we packed it back into the original box and into the garage for next summer. This is a safe slide my kids are 5 years (girl) and & 7 year (boy). A super 'toy' for holidays. I particularly liked how the bottom of the slide has padding against the side of the pool, so kids can't hurt themselves."
3,Fun but Not for Long,"Purchased in time for a 6-yr old's birthday party in late June. The kids loved it, and a few of the smaller moms as well...But we only got a few more weeks use out of it, before it ripped beyond repair - maybe a total of 5 weeks of use.Great for smaller kids, but bigger ones are too rough on it.All that said, we'd probably spend another hundred bucks on it next year for a similar experience."
4,intex waterslide,"Very happy with my purchase of the intex waterslide for my 8-year old grandson. He loves it. It was a birthday gift, and the kids really enjoyed it at his birthday pool party. It was the favorite thing at the party. Be aware that it does take up a lot of room so you do need space for it. It is meant to be used by children and not adults. But, for maybe 10-11 years old and younger it is fine. Because it was recently purchased, I don't know how durable it is or how long it will last."
3,WISH IT WAS BETTER,"This slide was fun while it lasted. The bottom part of slide(part that goes in pool) easily tore and was not ""patchable"" We wished it was better, because we really liked it!"
2,Dissapointed in INTEX was Not Durable!!!,"Used the slide 1 day and the bottom blow up part ripped at the seam. Luckily it did not pop the main slide portion, but since it is right at the seam i am not sure how long the slide will last. I am going to send pictures to INTEX and complain, we will see how there customer service is. I am diappointed because I have purchased many INTEX items and they were very durable and that was the only reason I decided to purchaes this one."
2,Durability,This product appears to be poorly constructed. Did not have the product in use for even a couple of weeks when one of the seams in the main inflatable ripped wide open rendering the product unusable. Too bad. The children really enjoyed this product.
5,No problems and lots of fun,I bought this for my 3 very active boys to use at a rental house. The slide stood up to two weeks of daily punishment. They enjoyed it as a slide and also used it as a boat in the pool. I made sure to keep the water pressure very low so there would not be a leak inside. It is made of heavy vinyl and is heavy to carry. We have deflated it and will see how it handles being re inflated after being stored but either way I feel as though we have gotten out money's worth.
2,Disappointed,"After reading other reviews about this product, I was hesitant to buy but most people said it will at least last the season and probably rip. I took a chance anyway thinking if I could get the summer out of it, my 2 small children would enjoy it. I ordered it and inflated it and the kids love it and have a lot of fun with it until just after 30 days of owning it with just a few uses, it tore where the kids have to climb up. I dont know if the tiny patch they include in the box will be able to hold. Fun to use but they didn't even get ten uses out of it. Poorly made and disappointing. If they were to make it stronger and/or thicker, it would be a very good product."
1,Popped again!,It came in quick and price dropped over $50 less from the first time we purchased it. The rubber is very week. First time we bought one it lasted 1 party then got a tear in the stairs. Still ok to use but only lasted one other time then it had too may leaks to fix.Ordered the next year- much cheaper- but it only made it for 2 partys again. Super thin easy to tear or rip and or pop. Very difficult to patch.If you buy it I would not count on it lasting for too long.
1,Disappointed in Intex Waterslide,I bought this product and we used for less than 2 weeks and the front side where the kids walked up the slide is already deflated. I would think this slide would at least last through the summer.
1,"Produce shipped with hole in it, Intex claims no warranty",Product would not stay inflated right out of the box. Called Intex customer service. They claim they take no responsibility for their products. Contacting BBB.
5,very good value for price,We have used it already a few times and no problems with tear or anything. A couple of adults also went down the slide and it holds up great.
2,"Has a hole in it, like other reveiwers mentioned","There are several places to blow up. You will need an air compresser to inflate. the main slide part, not the sides and stairs, has a slow leak in it and will deflate by end of the day. This slow leak was there from day one. Other reviewers warned of a crappy product. I will say that we can still use it, we just have to inflate the slide each day we want to use it. The rest of the slide stays inflated and we just need to add a little air on each daily use. Not worth spending $30 bucks to return the slide, so we will just deal with it."
1,poorly made,I purchased this intex water slide for my grandaughter who wieghe 100 lb and slide says up to 165 lbs. she had used it for about 2 weeks after i inflated it and as she was sliding down it friday 7/8/12 the whole left side split half way down and is beyound patching i would not purchase this item if i was you bought it threw amazon .com
1,Poor endurance,"This product began spring air leaks within 2 weeks, 2 weeks later iwas kaput. Dont waste your money on this"
1,Don't bother!,"I received this item on Monday, set it up on Tuesday, by Friday there were 4 holes in it! Poor quality, and my children were not rough with it at all! I was hoping it would last all summer long, not 4 days!"
1,1 day wonder,"This slide was fantastic while it was working, but after good use at a party for an hour 2 different holes appeared. Unfortunately the company said there is ""no warranty"" and I was out the good amount of money I spent. I seems that most recent reviews here are noting the same problems, so beware..."
4,water slide,"Purchased this water slide for several summer parties we have. It is a hit. The kids love it. The bottom blow up piece that slows the kids down when they hit the water ripped off at the first party, but the kids don't seem to mind, they go a lot faster into the water."
5,Great slide,I don't know why people give this such a negative comments. I have no problem with this. My kid and his friends love this and used it LOTS! Yes it is big but perfect for 8 years old kid.
3,So much fun!,This is a really fun item that we put into our pool and the kids go wild. It ads a lot of excitement to our pool parties with minimal people of course. It is rather large for the pool so too many people can be dangerous. It got a hole in the seam rather quickly and being that it is on the seam it is very hard to patch. It has now been sitting for a year because of the damage.
1,Used it 1 time with my 5 year old who is 40 pounds and the seams ripped.,Used it 1 time and the seams ripped. lots of fun for the day she used it. My daughter is 5 and is 40 pounds. its made like crap. Now I am going back and forth with the company trying to get it replaced. No luck
5,GREAT BUY,"i SAW THIS SLIDE IN A SWIMMING MAGAZINE AND WANTED TO GET ONE FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN, HOWEVER I DID NOT WANT TO PAY $130 OR MORE FOR THIS SAME SLIDE.I GOT A GREAT PRICE AND THE KIDS ARE HAVING FUN THIS SUMMER."
4,"Lasted A Season, The Rest of it's Life is a Bonus","I live in Southern CA so we have a pretty long season for swimming. I bought this last year and my five year-old and her friends used it all summer. I inflated it once at the start and didn't touch it again until I deflated it in the Fall. I bought it with the intention that it would last the year and become disposable but to my surprise, after inflating it again last week, it's working great with no leaks! Something that is different this year is how air temperature is affecting it. I didn't experience it last year and it's new for this year but it may be due to the fact that I didn't fill it as ""hard"" as last year. When it gets cold outside, the air contracts and it looks kind of saggy but when it gets to be afternoon it's totally great. Maybe I'll throw more air in this weekend to keep the shape more consistent.Anyhow, it's a fun thing for small kids. I don't think I would recommend it for teenagers and for sure, not for adults."
2,Disapointment right ouf of the box....,"The slide looks like a lot of fun, kids were extremely excited....only one problem....the largest air chamber will not hold air. We inflated the entire slide and watched as the large chamber deflated in a matter of 30 minutes. We refilled it again and same problem. Locate of the leak was not easy to find, likely in a seam, but we were shocked by the fact that it did not even get one day of use before it failed."
2,Fun BUT not strong enough for kids.,My kids had a blast on the water slide. The problem is the product lasted less than a month with a 5 - 8 and 11 year old. I think you need to have kids that are 7 and under. The older kids were too heavy and it couldn't take the abuse. But they had fun while it lasted.
2,seam ripped the first week.,"Seam ripped the first week. It was not able to be repaired. Read all the directions, made sure it was properly inflated. Paid too much money for a couple days use."
2,Fun but with a design weakness,"The slide was a blast for 2 days. Then one of the footholds tore. The slide can still be used, but climbing became tricky. Do not expect this product to last more than a few uses."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"We bought this for our four young grandchildren to use. They only used it approximately three hours' time in a day and a half of their fun in our large pool, and then it tore in a corner of the ""ladder"" where it attaches to another part of the slide. We tried patching it but it would not hold because of the location of the one inch tear. So we completely wasted our almost $100.00. We knew that the way it was made it would not last a really long time, but we were hoping to at least make it through one swimming season, but we were wrong! Please do NOT buy this product!!!!!"
2,Won't last,"Bought this slide for my 2 boys this summer. The boys are rough, but that's no excuse, the stair section ripped on the third day of use. It is made of very thin plastic not durable at all ripped in two places. Boys are 7 and 5. Would not recommend."
1,Great for one time use.......,"Purchased for my 5 year old. The kids used it twice and LOVED it!!! During the second use the seam on the bottom left started to tear. The slide was still usable but along with that the water line on the inside must have had a leak because the entire bottom of the slide filled up with water causing it to be very heavy. It took my husband and I over an hour of VERY HEAVY lifting to get all the water out. When we plugged it in again, hoping it was a one time issue the waterline broke completly off. Now air is coming out the water hole making it impossible to use. I am very upset because the kids love it so much. I'm considering purchasing it again and NEVER connecting the hose, just wetting it while they use it. Buyer Beware..... INTEX cares NOTHING about their quality or customer service."
1,Defective #2,"This would be a great addition to a pool. However, we received both first and second pool slides defective out of box. Be sure and return if yours is defective within Amazon 30 day window."
1,Junk Junk Junk Don't Waste Your Money,"Bought this for my kids, they were so excited when the package came we blew it up put it by the pool and realized in 2 spots it was ripped at the seams each got to slide down it once that is it. I read the reviews when I bought it and I was hoping to be a lucky one that had no problems but instead it was a complete waste of money going to send it back to get my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS SLIDE!!"
1,Poorly made,The floating part of the slide ripped away from slide and would not hold air. Called intex and told them but they said they never heard of this problem and there was nothing they would do. Waste of money.
1,Disappointed Twice,"I gave this slide 5 stars for fun because my grandchildren 2, 4 and 8 were having such a great time on it....while it lasted. I had to give it 1 star for durability, although it doesn't deserve any stars, because I had to return it twice...the first time the slide portion didn't hold air for more that 10 minutes and the second time the slide was perfect but the blue side portions didn't hold air. We took it into the pool to try to find where the leak was coming from, but could find no air bubbles. I'm sorry to say I rated it one star overall, but it should receive zero stars since it was unusable. I have to give Amazon 5 stars for their customer service and return policy."
1,Great slide for kids. Broke first day my kids played with it.,"This slide was a great idea. My kids loved playing on the slide for about two hours. Then it totally deflated. They are small kids, only 8 and 9 years old. The slide blew a huge gash in it tearing along a large seam and is now worthless. So, I paid about $85.00 for my kids to have two hours of fun. NOT WORTH IT! The durability of this slide makes it UNACCEPTABLE!!! Do not buy it unless you're ready to gamble that it will last for more than a few hours."
2,poor quality,Lasted only one week before it burst under the weight of a 45lb child. Was great fun for the few days it lasted but at a cost of $70 it should last at least the summer. No rough housing or multiple kids caused the failure. Just poor quality
4,This slide achieved it's purpose!,"I bought this slide for my son's 7th birthday party. We had 12 boys in our pool and they all had a great time on it. It's been up since Memorial Day. We also used it for an End Of School party. We had 11 year olds and 15 years olds that all had fun on it. I read the reviews before I bought it and there were some that complained about it getting a hole and the company not offering to replace it. Luckily, we made it thru the parties and hopefully, it'll last the rest of the summer. But, we have definitely gotten our money's worth all ready and with the free shipping, it was a great deal. Make sure you have a good pump to blow it up. Some sections will need a pump, others are small enough to blow up by mouth."
1,Intex Waterslide,This is the 3rd one I have bought(stored the first one...in a crate 3 times what it came in)..kids love it..but this year the one I bought is defective and when I unpacked it and blew it up I threw the boxes away. The next morning when I walked out by the pool...the part the kids slide down was deflated. I contacted the company and they told me for a new one I would have to put it in the box it came in and mail it back to them....as hard as it was to get out of the box...I laughed and said even if I still had the box there was no way I would ever get it back in. They were not willing to send me a new one. I was very disappointed. I have to fill up the sliding section 3 times a day now if the kids are over...so that sucks. I will probably break down and buy another one...but this time I will save the box....send it in a larger box with the small box enclosed!! Somewhere they have the same person that folds a perfect fitted sheet putting this in a box!!!!
2,Intex Watersilde - Be prepared for constant patching,"At first I was impressed when I opened the box. It seemed to be very well made, very heavy.To my disapointment it sprung a leak within 2 days of normal use. Since then it has developed another three leaks.All of these leaks are in the area of the stepping holes. I have been able to patch them using plumbers goop but it took many attempts.I admit that when there are no leaks it is quite fun and a good low cost alternative to the high priced ""real slides"". If you want a low cost fun slide go ahead and buy it but have alot of plumbers goop on hand.I wish the company would improve the durability, expecially at the footholds."
5,Great Slide!,This is an excellent slide for the price. We had 13 children in our pool this week and the slide help up amazingly well. This is our second inflatable slide and this one is hands down better than the other. It is tall and has a hose hook-up to make the slide fast!
1,Warning! This slide will tear & has NO guarantee!,I was so excited for my nephew to use this slide in the pool this Summer. Unfortunately he was only able to use this a few times (at best) until the slide ripped at the seam. My nephew weighs 30lbs soaking wet so there is no excuse for this happening. I was heartbroken to find the company that sold me this product didn't care and stated that they only extend a 30-day warranty on inflatable products like this. I purchased this in the Winter for him to use in the Summer so the conversation was quickly over. They have a responsibility to their customers to provide a durable & reliable product for $90. This company's customer service is terrible and I will not buy from them again.
2,slide fell apart,"The first few days the slide was fun, then it started tearing in the slots where they put there feet, was not able to repair, it would not hold. Now after 1 month the bottom is falling off, it was a disappointment to spend that much money to have it fall apart, but I blame myself I read the reviews, and they all said it would fall apart. Only purchase this if you don't beleive me, otherwise good luck."
1,Deflated within 2 dayss,"Do not waste your money on this product. The slide deflated within 2 days. It ripped on a seam on the stairs the first day. It was still usable so I figured I'd try to get my money out of it. I let the kids climb up the deflated stairs only to come outside the next day and the part they slide down was deflated. Total piece of junk, save your money, I wish I would have listened to all the bad reviews but we want our kids to have fun and thought we'd risk it. Bad decision!!!"
2,intex waterslide,purchased this slide last year and it lasted for about a monthpurchased it again this year - because kids do have a lot of fun - and 2 weeks later tear going up the stepswill try to patch but I'm not surprisedit doesnt last longnot sure if worth the $$kids ages 4-8 one at a time...makes no difference - it will break eventuallywill barely last a season
2,"Lots of fun, but does not last!!!","I bought this for my grandsons, ages 7 and 10, to use with their above ground pool. It was a great hit! They loved it. But it lasted 4 days, even though the boys were always supervised and did not abuse the slide. It ripped in the seam at the top and then ripped where the ladder connects to the side. I tried to patch it with a kit from the pool store, but it would not hold as the leak is in the seam. Poor quality and design. It was not worth the $129!! Don't waste your money."
2,Poor quality,"The slide is a great concept, but the quality simply is not there. Upon taking it out of the box and using it for the first time, we discovered that the ladder would not hold air at all! We lifted the children up so they could use it, but are very disappointed that it was delivered in faulty condition."
1,POOR,"I ordered this product as a birthday gift for my 5-year-old nephew. Needless to say, when he received it on his birthday he was so EXCITED. His dad put the slide together but by the morning after it had deflated - it had a small puncture in it that hadn't been noticed when it was assembled. As the slide was now totally waterlogged it was a little while until it could be returned - I doubt it would have been appreciated if it was returned as a dripping, soggy mess.When Amazon was contacted for a replacement we received the total run around and the final response was ""too bad, so sad"" and no replacement or refund was given. The fact that products can sometimes get damaged in transit is understandable but the the fact that no-one would assist in a replacement or refund, is totally beyond me.The service we received regarding this product was, quite simply, dreadful!I've been an amazon customer for years and never had an issue - but this time, the product and service was extremely poor."
1,It lasted 2 days,"I should have taken the advice of the others that warned about this slide. It only lasted 2 days- I was very disappointed as we purchased it for my daughters bday party, and it didn't make it."
4,"Nice quality, could have a few extra details.","I ordered this for my father after he mentioned something about wanting a large map. So far he loves it. It could be a little more detailed in some areas, but I can't complain."
5,Calm Assertiveness... no pain or fear suggested here.,"Cesar's approach of using calm assertiveness is gentle and effective. If you are using pain or fear to force your dog to behave how you want, then you are doing it wrong. He uses no tension on the leash unless doing a quick touch or leash movement to redirect the dog's focus - not at all to bring pain. He meets the dogs on their level and helps to 'train' humans on dog psychology, correcting the idea that all dogs are little humans. They aren't, and approaching them using dog psychology works, gently and effectively. Our dog is a lucky recipient of this training method, and he is not only happier, but healthier from the new routine Cesar has outlined for us in this video and in his show on National Geographic Channel - The Dog Whisperer."
3,A great read that surprises you several times,"A story that is strange at times, a bit disjointed and is obviously the writer's first work at pulling a group of sub-plots together. It is one of those you put down intending not to go back. Then, you keep thinking about what and where and you go back to see what happens. If you do that enough times you get to a very surprising ending. All in all it is not a great work but is a fun read, especially if you like football and antiques. It would make quite a movie."
3,Inside the NFL (Missouri style),"This book is a good look at the NFL, and features lots of good geographical setting details about Kansas City and Saint Louis. The development of the story is predictable, but enjoyable.What >IS NOT< enjoyable is the type setting and proof reading. I have never read >ANY< commercially published book so poorly executed.Read it, anyway, if you like football."
4,Good fruity taste....,"One of my kids likes these and one isn't crazy about them. I think they are good, I don't eat them all the time but once in a while. We tried the cherry flavor and it tastes good."
5,Healthy snack and 7gm of fiber,"I bought several boxes because I love the taste and enough fiber of 2 fruit cups, and most of all my three kids 7,5,3 love them too."
5,Great stocking and best place to buy it is [...],I work many hours daily in an operating room and it has been taking a toll on my legs....these stockings make all the difference! Amazon is the best place to buy as I had quite a few experiences prior to finding the stockings at Amazon that were downright terrible. One purchase I made was charged promptly to my account but I never received the merchandise! That one ended up in Oregon's Attorney General's office as a complaint until I finally got my money back almost nine months later!!!! I am a loyal Amazon customer and truly appreciate their integrity and customer service.
3,Check the size before buying,"Got these because of the high ratings. The quality is great! The stockings fit really nicely and provide good/comfortable pressure. However, the product that I bought didn't have much description of the size or measurements on the detail page. So I got large (I am shoe size 8 and have BIG calves) and I probably could do easily with the size small. Check same/similar products with other sellers on Amazon, they have size charts that can help (I realized it after I received my order). The price though is the best on this one.My main complaint is the seam on the toes. The stockings have loosely fitting toes for comfort (great), however, there is a seam across the toes right in the middle (goes across the middle bone of each toe) and it bothers me with some shoes."
5,The essential reference for the Tyler (et al) collector,I find this book indispensible when trolling eBay for Tyler and family outfits and accessories. There are wonderful detail pictures of the outfits and dolls and special editions. The pictures show you what should have come with the doll or outfit originally. It provides edition sizes too and has saved me money by preventing me from bidding on partial outfits or dolls that are incomplete or have been modified. I have worn this hardback just about limp but it has such a strong binding and good quality paper that it is still stout. I wish Tonner would do a similar book for the Brenda Starr series when she has her 5th anniversary with Tonner.
3,Good quality but RAM is not enough,This laptop is good quality but onboard 1GB RAM is not good enough to run Vista Premium. I encourage considering higher memory model.
4,she likes it,i bought this for my niece. Its better than the dell she previously had. according to her
3,"Basic laptop and in that regard, it is OK","OK; I have owned this model for 6 months and I feel I'm in a position to have an objective all round view. First things first: This is a basic laptop and any one considering a purchase has got to do it on that basis. In that regard it is OK. You will note that there are only two USB ports and 1Gb in memory. Yawn... Yes, the VGN-N320E does not excel in anything but, in all fairness, I don't think it was meant to. The screen is bright enough. The sound is dismal (but so are all laptops) and it struggles with Windows Vista. The only area where it is decidedly bad is the touchpad. This has got its own mind and you are best advised to get a wireless mouse to avoid frustration. Other than that, for a basic mobile computer, it passes the test."
5,Great,"Very interesting and it is a great door opener to the world of Buddhism, meditation and mind science"
2,Too difficult for a child to work.,"My 6 yr old bought this toy along with other Hulk toys, but this one you need to squeeze Hulks legs together to get him to smash the tank, but my son isn't strong enough to work it. Heck, I can barely get the thing to work. It's a simple enough concept, but it is just too hard to to get his legs to squeeze together. Other than that, it is a typical action figure."
2,Disappointed in Amazon reviews,"Sibelius's violin concerto is the single piece that started my interest in classical music. I admit I may not have a seasoned ear, but I know for certain that I should have paid more attention to the lesser rated reviews. I found many of the notes to be glazed over and muted and didn't have the emotion I would expect. I have not taken the time to listen to the full disc as I was pretty disappointed with what I had initially heard. I cannot believe that people are comparing it to Heifetz.The recording quality is excellent though."
4,a good book,"After reading these books yearsa ago when they first came out, and then reading Aidan's Fate recently, I was plesantly surprised at how much I remember of these books. Aidan's Fate was a good book. McKenzie keeps getting visions thinking that her boyfriend Aidan is going to get killed, on Valentine's Day no less! A great book, I enjoyed the whole series!"
5,New fave,"I picked this disc up and it has quickly become one of my favorites. Swinging, unique arrangements of classics and a few new tunes. Great CD."
3,Good CD for a Gift,This CD was purchased for a gift. My nephew liked it because he went to college in New Orleans.
3,"Nice, not exciting","Carols in genuine New Orleans style. Nice selection of songs, giving representative variety to the collection. Performances are not inspired, but average or somewhat better--""workmanlike"" might be the best description. I'm glad I added this collection to my small eclectic group of Christmas CDs."
5,Franck Feast,"I have long enjoyed the Symphony in D minor but this recording includes the Symphonic Variations which are a delight. Unlike a concerto for solo piano, the piano, in this work, is more and integral part of the orchestra."
4,SUPPORT HOSE,"The product arrived pretty quick. Kudos for the prompt service. The hose are ok, other than they are longer than I anticipated. I guess when you buy xx or xxx sizes, they compensate for length."
4,"Good, but easy to put a hole in them","I'm on my third pair of these. They are nice and strong, but I have twice put my thumb through them. You'd think they'd be a bit stronger to hold up to wear and tear, but maybe I'm just rough on them. glad to find you can buy them on Amazon - my local med supply place charges $35 a pair. Oh, and the 3XL fit my legs (i was a catcher for years, playing ball, and I have really thick calves) - but the length is a bit long. i fold them down on top and they're fine. :]"
2,not is the expected product,"Pequeño Johnny ""Pasos De Gigante"" Product Details: Number of Discs: 2. ASIN: B0015N36WK.Not is the expected product, does not include the Bonus DVD, brought only one disc"
4,Lowest price on L-glutamine powder that I would still trust to be the real thing.,"It's not my favorite flavor but it dissolves easily. I don't suggest mixing with milk because it makes it taste like sour milk. With water it reminds me of alka-seltzer. I hope people will comment on the flavor because I was under the impression that it is supposed to be relatively tasteless. I would like to know that I did not receive a defective product. I have noticed that I am sore for less time after lifting weights. Its hard to say for sure because I have been changing a few things lately, but that is suppose to be one of the effects of L-Glutamine. And that makes me think that its doing it's job."
5,GREAT price,"My mohter who is 90 loves this product and takes this every day. I was so happy to find on Amazon the exact product we have been getting at the Health Food store at lest than 1/2 the cost. Fast, easy quick delivery."
2,Absolutely repulsive,"It smells and tastes EXACTLY like powdered parmesan cheese. At first I thought it really was parmesan cheese (hard to really tell the difference). However, after taking the maximum dose everyday for a week, I did start noticing SOME muscle soreness relief; so I guess it does work. Now I just have to torture myself to take this every day without gagging."
3,"Great price, but I'm not so sure","Great value for the price, but it makes my protein shakes taste really funny, so I'm switching back to the capsules next time."
4,"Good pre- and post-workout supplement, just mask the taste","As an intermediate weight-lifter, I use this before and after workouts (as the product advises) in addition to the L-glutamine that I get from my Body Fortress whey protein powder which also has L-glutamine, but does not display the amount per serving.Once I added this to my large list of workout recovery-based supplements I have not noticed a big difference, but there is (I think) a difference--that is, being a little less sore and for less time after intense workouts. Either way I'm glad I take it. It lasts long enough that it doesn't feel like an expense.The taste is--interesting. Bad is not the word, but ""off"". In water (8-10 oz.), it's very noticeable. I add it to over 20 oz of water or to a pre-workout shake. I imagine a stronger flavor from a juice, or milk would make the powder unnoticebale. In a protein shake (whey, I use Body Fortress, various flavors) it's totally unnoticeable."
5,Easy enough...,"This Glutamine Powder has a nice neutral taste and easily mixes smooth with no clumps in water with just a spoon. I've read that L-Glutamine is good for your immunity, so I take this and vitamin C whenever I feel like I'm coming down with something and it does seem to help me recover faster."
4,Start Early,This is a great video. Make sure you start this with your partner early in the pregnancy. We recommend within the first trimester if at all possible. It's a great way to spend time together and get ready for the big day. If you wait too long though the mother may not be able to do most of the things. If you start early she will be used to using these muscles and have a great and relaxing time with it.
4,It's ok.,"I started with this video in my 6th month of pregnancy, with no previous yoga experience. For me it's ok, it has several stretching and relaxing exercises, and most of them seem to be fine for people with no experience."
2,A little helpful,I thought this video would be a walk through of different exercises and breathing techniques but instead it explains them once then moves on.
1,Video may lead to injury,"I am a long time athlete involved in gymnastics, yoga, pilates, dance, ect. I bought this video hoping for a good workout during pregnancy. The moves performed in this video will lead to injury especially in a person that does not normally stretch. There is alot of bouncing and jerky movements that are never recommended in yoga. The order in which they do moves makes no sense. You should properly warm up all your muscles before going into back bends and other tough moves. I did not even finish the entire workout b/c I was so disappointed in the lack of technique in this video."
2,It's an OK video,"I'm not really into yoga, have taken a few classes here and there, but by no means an expert. I felt this video was a little too slow and unchallenging for me, like I wasn't getting much of a workout. If you want something to relax and strech you, this video is for you. Otherwise if you are looking for something that is more of a 'workout' where you sweat, I would advise another video."
1,would not call this yoga,"I do not think this lady is a real yoga teacher. First off, there is no ""bouncing"" in a typical yoga practice. Second, yoga is supposed to focus on your breathing in relation to how you are stretching your body. This video does not talk about or focus on your breathing except that you twist and such on exhales/inhales. Also, if you are keeping pace with the people in the video, you may end up hyperventilating. In my understanding, you should have slow and steady breathing during a yoga practice. Also, many of her poses are not for a largely pregnant person, unless you have been an avid yogi throughout your entire pregnancy.I was under the impression that there was lamaz exercises on this video, but all it is is an interview. lame.do not buy this video. it makes me mad every time i try to do it."
2,Not impressed,"I only did this workout once, but it wasn't worth a second try for me. I wanted a video that made me feel refreshed and relaxed, and this just didn't do it. With other yoga workouts I've done, between the relaxing music, background, and flow of the positions, I can really meditate and loosen up. This video wasn't relaxing and the timing and transitions felt awkward."
2,Not so pleased,It was so hard to relax and do the exercises because she talks through all of the breathing exercises! I started getting more frustrated by using the video not calm.
3,Not really a good workout,"I did some yoga before this DVD, but not much - I found this very boring. I guess I'm used to getting sweaty and having a ""really good workout"". This didn't do it for me. I will use the video from time to time for stretching, but overall I wasn't pleased with the ""workout"" I got from this DVD. Also, I was disappointed that the workouts weren't fully explained. You were just told to do an exercise, not how to properly do it - I was concerned about posture and such when doing these pregnant. If you are looking for something to get you sweating and work you out, I don't feel this is it."
3,Okay,"I used this dvd twice in the past 4 weeks. The exercise feels good and feels like it loosens tight muscles, but it's not very motivating, I guess, since I'm not motivated to use it more often. It feels like it was created/choreographed by a 4 year old girl, so you probably don't want anyone else to be in the room when you do the exercises (unless you're a 4 year old girl). I prefer Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga video.Prenatal Yoga"
1,INJURED--Beware,"Let's get one thing out of the way. I have a good amount of experience at yoga. In fact, I am still working out with other pre-natal DVDs as well as taking classes at our local yoga studio. For whatever reason, the range and speed of motion was unclear in this video and as a result, I pulled my intercostal muscle. As anyone who has ever pulled this muscle can attest, I takes several weeks to heal. My slow recovery has mounted my anger towards this video. The exercise that I was doing when it happened was the one where you place your hands on your shoulders and very swiftly twist from side to side. I have done variations of this stretch, but never at this speed and intensity. It seems totally unecessary and unsafe. BE CAREFUL!"
4,enjoyable and easy to follow...,"I liked this Yoga video over a few others that I have (mainly Shiva Rea's) because you do not need a lot of ""props."" The video is nicely broken into different workouts and you can easily pick and choose what you want to do based on time constraints, etc. I am 25 wks. pregnant with my second baby so I don't always have a lot of time to do videos - I like to do the 30 min. energizing routine in the morning, it is a good start to the day. I would not call this an intense workout, but it feels good and is easy to follow. I have been doing Yoga for years and sometimes have to remember that these are pregnancy videos, your body is changing and they are geared towards those changes; I am definetly getting some relief from sciatica and lower back pain. Also, the instructor and music are non-irritating, as in some of the other videos. I also like the Crunch video."
3,Basic Yoga,"I was hoping for something a bit more challenging. This is a very basic yoga DVD. Great for relaxing, but definitely not what I consider a work-out. I didn't break a sweat or even raise my heart beat. The poses are not repeated, nor do you hold a pose long enough to really benefit from the stretch. If you are looking for something that focuses on relaxation and breathing, then buy it; otherwise look elsewhere."
1,Uncomfortable,"Lots of menu items and intro's that you can't fast forward through. And I tried to watch all the workouts first, but it made me go in order and then wouldn't let me select anything!I was happy that the women were more modestly dressed than a lot of workout video's since my son's like to do these with me. And the relaxing 15 minute workout seemed good. I wouldn't mind doing that before bed. But the main 30 minute workout was full of poses that are uncomfortable for me now in my first trimester, and don't feel good, and I cannot imagine doing them with an even bigger belly! Those ladies made me feel weird watching them, I just really disliked this DVD! All the weird breathing and weird tongue action and acting all serene and spiritual about it. Weird."
3,Color is not the same as pic,Scarf slide was ok. My main complaint is that the picture does not clearly show what the scarf slide will look like. It is a plain silver. Not multi colored like it shows.
3,Good but not great,"Things I like about this tool: it is compact and light-weight; the built-in light is very useful; and the batteries charge quickly and retain their charge quite long. My major complaint -- and the reason I give it only 3 stars -- is that the torque is inadequate. I was unable to drive 2-inch screws into softwood, even with the impact driver. My ancient DeWalt 14 volt cordless, on its last legs, has much, much more torque than the Makita. A minor annoyances is that there is no place to store driver bits on the drill itself. In summary, the price does not match the performance. (Note that I have not yet used it as a hammer-drill.)"
1,High Priced Gadget,"I build custom furniture therefore, I use a screw gun every working day. I need a screw gun that can use every concieveable drill bit plus all the screw bits. Buying as an asserory a ball-dent chuck to increase the versitility of a tool that cost twice as much as a drill that has a keyless chuck as a standard is like an insult to someone who uses tools profestionally. I think Makita is looking for the rich hobbyest who will buy any gadget. Also, the bag is really cheep.Ed HandA Creation By Hand, Inc."
3,Good for rare use,Drill is good for rare home use. My main complaint is the battery. It selfdischarges vary fast when it is not in use.
2,OK if you only plan on using it a few times a year,"For what I paid ([...] and free shipping) it's not terrible, so long as you don't plan on using it that often; [...] to have a variable-speed cordless-drill around isn't that bad.In the long run there are probably better choices, though. For example you can sometimes get a Ryobi 18 volt One+ at home depot for $30, and I would have a lot more confidence in a Ryobi than this (plus, the Ryobi has two speeds and goes up to 1300 RPM, while the Powersmith is limited to 550 RPM). Sure, the Ryobi lacks a case and the drivers/bits included with the Powersmith, but this isn't much of a consideration given that the included drill bits are terrible; tried to use them to drill through very thin steel and the tip of the drill bit folded over on itself. I bought a cheap set of Ryobi bits for $4 and they cut through it like butter. The bits might be OK for wood and plastic, but they can not cut through metal."
1,Pwersmith Cordless Drill Kit,I am sure this is a nice item but since I never received it nor has my money been returned nor has the company for this item returned my attempts to contact them I want NOPTHING to do with it or anything else they sell.
4,"Good Choice, Ride is Firmer.","Pleased with the Monroe Strut, although my 2003 Toyota Corolla initially road stiffer than I expected. Now, 2 years and 10k more miles, the ride is still firmer than stock, but more comfortable. This 208,000 miles-03 Corolla is fun to drive with these new struts along with new axles, control arms, ball joints and everything else replaced up front!! I'd rather drive it than our 11 Elantra."
2,Birdman is wack,"all i have to say is Wayne is the only reason you should even consider getting this c.d,Birdman is terrible he talks about the same stuff in the same tone the whole way through(basically i just lisen to waynes verse and hit next)"
1,What are all of you talking about! This Album sucks!,"This album is Horrible. The Diry South is DESTROYING hip hop. Im glad I only ""Bought"" this cd. I hate the dirty south rap. All of the dirty south rappers are the same. They all rap about they're stupid Platinum teeth, beamers with the rims that are really big and look stupid (they think it looks gangsta) . There is no skill in any of that dirty south rap. They keep repeating themselves the whole time. I love hip hop/Rap but The Dirty South is Destroying it. I wish we could bring back the old stuff like-HOuse OF PainCypress HillFunkdoobiestLords of the undergroundWu tangTupacBiggieThe PharcydeNWAPublic Enemyand Alot More.I ""Bought"" this album because i figured why not, its a free album. I tried to listen to it and like it but i couldnt. The beats SUck and the lyrics Suck. PERIOD. Dont buy. The best move would be to keep the dirty south rappers out of the Rap game. Period!"
1,WHAT'S THAT S---T ????,"you can't say dis is rap nor hip-hop just because dis album sucks...deez beats are weaker than my vomit and the lyrix..BLEAH!!!!!...dirty south is the ruin of hip-hop, no doubt. let's go back in the days of '94 when hiph-op was real!!!"
2,Can you hear me now? I cant,"This phone, I have replaced twice now through Amazon, is a peice of garbage. I have since replaced it. The earpeice is always going out, the answer machine deletes messages, and the clock will not stay set. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE."
2,"Mediocre, was expecting more..","I hate it when I try somthing new and end up with a crappy cd like this. I first heard beyond the embrace with opeth last year (long b4 this cd was out). I was impressed so when I saw this cd on the rack I picked it up ready for a great album. What I got was an awful awful cd of metallica worship, thought they do have some of there own elements I will admit. The melodies...dull, the production...way to dry, the vocals....ABSOLUTLY AWFUL. After quite a few listens throught I hadnt caught on and gave up. I would recomend this is you like thrash metal with more hard rock type vocals though."
1,Where do I start.....,"..do I beat a dead horse by saying that these guys are a ripoff of Metallica (new metallica) or do I just say these guys are playing BAD. Maybe I can just leave it at both. I honestly thought I would like this record. I was excited to go purchase it after I heard ""weak and the wounded"" which is a decent song. I soon realized shortly after I popped it in my CD player that this album was more rock n' roll than metal. There are some decent moments, but for the most part this singer almost tries to mimic the hetfield oooohhhh yeahahahaha's and it is just awful. I don't know why someone would have the balls to ripoff st. anger.(which is much worse than this record). I think maybe they were inspired by Metallica's crappy St. Anger to go out and write a good St. Anger, which still doesn' blow my skirt up too much. Anyways, im sorry to any fans of this record who gave it 5 perfects stars?? but I tried to like it, and it's just not me. Not even worth a download!!!"
1,Metallica new album??nop...,"Let me tell U guys one thing...this album should be recorded by Metallica, because they are really in need to do something like this...but theres something wrong with this band, because they have no musical identity...what is this? Metallica wannabe's?Guitars are much more basic,the bass is just like in metallica first cd's,the voice is a real copy(well done!) and putting it all together its...what would be a good album from Metallica, but its not...its just one awful cd from a band with no musical identity,a bad musical orientation and a great lack of originality."
3,"Nothing new to see here, folks.","While I can appreciate the musicianship of this album overall, I can't help but think I've heard it somewhere before. The entire time I was listening to it, I kept thinking it sounded like a mix between Soilwork and Darkane....and then I realized, ""OH,"" that's a band called THE DEFACED. Overall this album is pretty good, but it's not really anything special, and as for the band having THREE, count 'em, THREE guitarists, the music doesn't sound as, how should I say this, ""thick"" as perhaps it should. This perhaps might be a function of the production, I'm not sure. Overall a few hooks here and there, but nothing to wet your shorts over."
3,3.5 Stars... OK but nothing special.,"Beyond The Embrace is basically another of the ""we're a simplistic/sloppy version of thrash meets melody"" bands. They are not especially good for the genre, not especially bad either. The use of a more old school thrash vocalist makes them sound more like Metallica than most of the ""New Wave of American Metal"" (even though it is just a dumbed down ripoff of the scandinavian metal scene). The downtuned guitars lack the intensity to give them credit in that area, and they don't have melody to even come close to early In Flames or Soilwork, and in basically every other area they are topped by at least one band.Fans of the genre will probably find Beyond the Embrace entertaining, but there are many better bands.I would suggest checking out these albums before listening to them:Anything by MetallicaThe Haunted - RevolverSoilwork - A Predator's PortraitIn Flames - Clayman or earlierMastodon - LeviathanAny of the late 80s/early 90s thrash metal bands."
4,Woah! Their right!,"This does sound alot like Metallica. I went to their concert last night with Amorphis and Into Eternity and I didn't really notice but when I heard this album it sounded VERY similar to Metallica. I like it and all, but I think the should find their own sound instead of ripping off Metallica. 7.6/10"
4,"Great Album, but their first release is even better!","I first found out about this band from an amazon.com recommendation, so I checked out some mp3s and was very impressed. This band has 3 guitarists, and utilizes them all very well. The rest of the album is just as good. Picture Kirk Hammett from Metallica meets Anders Friden from In Flames, plus some other heavy riffs. There is one instrumental track called ""Ashes"" that is great, reminds me of Casting Shade by Shadows Fall. Other standout tracks are Redeemer and Absent. There aren't any songs I dislike, but my least favorite is ""My Fall."" Insect Song lacks a bit of originality with the heavy Metallica and In Flames sound, but hell I can't come up with better solos yet."
5,support knee highs,"These are a great deal. I have washed them multiple times, no problems with quality of product. they do not bind at the knee. I stand most of my work day, my legs no longer feel fatigued. i will buy more."
2,Lights-Remixed Lightly,"Lights 2 consists of all of the original tracks from ""Lights,"" remixed into a more subtle, lounge style.I made the mistake of thinking new tracks would be on this but I was wrong. It's basically ""Lights"" remixed with a lighter touch; not as aggressive as ""Lights.""I prefer ""Lights"" over ""Lights 2."""

3,More Genre-Bashing,"While Nalbantian has veiled it in ""neutral"" academic prose and by using the particular cases of a few famous writers, her argument is just another example of memoir-hating. While I think it's an interesting exercise to try to trace author experience through fiction, doing so in a way that bashes an entire other category of writing should certainly make us suspicious. And while I agree that many readers are obsessed with memoir for all the wrong reasons, there are memoirists who do more than regurgitate facts, who actually write in literarily complex ways. The search for a pithy, simple thesis has unfortunately led S.N. astray in what might otherwise have been very interesting work."
3,How much is too much?,The constant edification of authors reaches a sickening degree when their lives are marched out like so much cannon fodder. Are they interesting people? Undoubtedly. Worthy of print? Surely. Worthy of endless reams of print that never stops? You get the idea
3,Some fun things to do with black holes - on you computer,"This is an interesting combination of a science fiction short story written in the second person (odd, that) and a light series of lectures on the subject of black holes. There are computer programs to try, and the maths is easy to follow without any complicated vector operators. The story has an amusing twist at the end, and the whole work conveys a sense of wonder. Such a subject can hardly be expected to have any practical relevance, but the computer programs do give the dabbler in BASIC a change to have a go."
5,A wonderful trip to a black hole by way of a calculator,"For the physics/astronomy hobbyist, this book makes for great entertainment. Pull up a calculator, a pad and pencil, and about a gallon of your favorite beverage, then kick back and enjoy the ride. ""Black Holes"" will keep you busy tinkering with the math and thinking about its consequences. I very much enjoyed playing with this book!"
5,Edutainment at its best!!!!,This is an excellent book to give to anyone how are new to the subject of the physics concerning black holes. Thanks to this book I am able to explain how black holes work in a simple and clear way. I like how the author uses you and Mr. Plex to educate the reader about black holes. It's a trip! This is most likely the best (and most fun) book on black holes I've ever read.
5,"Superb, delightful presentation","I enjoyed this wonderful introduction to black holes. There's something here for everyone, from high school students to scientists. The graphics are gorgeous. The presentation was so friendly that I could not help but learn about these awesome marvels in our universe."
5,The West made real!,"Bat let's you know that history is never perfect, and therein lies the charm of this book. Combining that which can be agreed, and that which well might have been, Bat Masterson's Creede takes you into the mining taverns of Creede in a way that let's you smell the smoke, taste the whisky and encounter the lives of Creede's most entertaining former residents. When imagination encounters fascinating facts, the result is this fine work. From the glowing charms of the card dealers, to the glow of Creede's first electric light, this book delivers the true West."
5,Spy vs. Spy!,"Intrigue, danger, adventure...fact is stranger than fiction in this broad examination of the world of espionage and terrror...go underground with the real men and women of the shadow world."
3,Not for beginners,"This is a beautiful book, however, there is almost nothing on actual application techniques -- which is what most beginners are looking for. Excellent information on products and tools but very few photos of examples."
5,Best Compilation of MJ Songs,"I grew up with this CD. You have practically all his most memorable songs from all his previous CDs and another, his ""HIStory"" album. This CD brings back many many memories for me, and it is worth every penny, you have songs like ""Rock With You"", ""Remember the Time"", ""Heal The World"", ""Black and White"", ""You Are Not Alone""....30 Songs of Micheal Jacksons, enough said. It's amazing..You won't regret buying this if your an MJ Fan. I can't believe he wrote most of the songs...a True Artist!"
4,* * * Michael rapped in a song called `Money`,"Sound quality of Disc 2 makes me very disappointed and unhappy to hear like it`s been pirate copied in the amateur homestudio.Every song of Disc2 sounds so flat,seems not like Michael Jackson`s quality approval!!Disc 1 sounds perfectly deep and crystal clear as Michael had hands on while recording as he used to do.Disc 1 sound quality seems the original one to me.For Michael`s fans and admirers this HIStory book 1 is worth to have in MJJCollection because there was 1 and only song that Michael rapped under his lng carrier and it called `Money`He did the whole song very well and very different from the others and it became one of my favorites!"
3,"5 Stars for the Hits, but Minus 2 for the New Material","""History"" is a greatest hits album full of undeniable classics weighed down by another disc of stunningly banal material. Jackson initially wanted to do a single disc with only a couple new tracks, and it looks like he should have stuck with that plan. I won't go on about ""Billie Jean"" ""Man in the Mirror,"" and ""Don't Stop til You Get Enough."" Those hits will remain classics. But the new material is among Jackson's very worst. ""They Don't Care About Us"" is a misguided stab at singing about oppression, ""Money"" is as flat as warm cola, and ""Little Susie"" is appallingly corny. Only the R.Kelly ballad ""You Are Not Alone"" shows any promise. If you're a Jackson completist and have to have it all, then you'll probably pick this up. Otherwise, get the single-CD version of ""HIStory"" instead."
5,Michael Jackson Devotee,"I love Michael Jackson's music and I believe that he is a wonderful and loving person. I own the following Jackson Albums: Off The Wall Thriller Bad Danerous HIStory Blood On The Dance Floor - A old Jackson 5 cassette The LIVE concert CD of The Jackson's last tour. - I have HIStory on video, Danerous the short films, Dangerous World Tour Concert 1993 on HBO on video tape, I have un countable tv recordings on Michael. - I write the ""In My Opinion"" column for the 4Fans Newsletter on Michael Jackson. - Michael has his new single: ""Angel"" coming out this August 1999. Brace Yourselves for the return of Michael Jackson :-)"
3,The 2nd disc annoys me,Firstly this album misses out too much important stuff. I mean where is Dirty Diana and Off the Wall?The 2nd disc has got too many bad songs. You are not alone and They dont care about us are the best on that. Childhood is just silly.I know people think its over the top but I actually like the booklet it gave me half an hour of light entertainment. It takes long enough to get through.The first cd is the best but most Michael Jackson fans are already going to own those songs. The 2nd one annoys me.The worst thing about this collection is the version of 'history'. They should have had the dance one from the video its my favourite Michael song. The version of 'history' on here shouldn't even EXIST
4,A classic is born,"I think that this collection has potential. Michael just wanted to tell people to leave him alone and forget about the past history of his life. Although, I could have done without a few of the old songs, the new ones however, did have a little leave me alone in them."
3,Not His Best But I Liked It,This cd was all over the place but I understand why since this cd came out after that 1st round of molest stuff. He was upset but damn this cd was very hit and miss. The first cd has some of his many classics and the second cd has all new songs. Out of all his new songs only 5 were what I call great.1 Scream2 They Don't Care About Us3 You Are Not Alone4 Stranger in Moscow5 This Time AroundEverything else was ok. Nothing special
5,Its a no-brainer to give 5 stars.,"Some people like dogs,some people like rats,some people like snakes,some people like sharks....to each his/her own..I like Michael Jackson Period."
4,Love The Oldes,MJ the old school is stall the best. Disc 2 is on the scale of 1 so i could not give it a five star rateing.Swordsman IISony PSOne Console
5,A must here!,"These CD's made me feel the love that Michael so often tried to share with his fans. It was amazing and the song ""Smile"" was my favorite. It's got to be number one on the charts. And for all those that wanted to judge Michael for being who he is should here his song ""Childhood"". I cried while listening to that song because I realize he just wanted to enjoy the life that we non- famous people so often take for granted. I just hate that he had to die before we (the World) realized what we had in him. Michael was ""Love"" to me and always will be. I am truly going to miss him and all that he has contributed to my world through songs."
3,"1st CD Great! 2nd CD more or less sucks, except for #9","If you like Michael Jackson, you'll love the 1st CD. It's the cream of the crop of MJ songs. But be careful, the music is so rich you could get sick of it pretty quickly. Take it in small doses here and there.The second CD, as a whole, didn't do much for me. I LOVED ""You Are Not Alone"", in fact it is my favorite song on the entire album. If I could, I would put it on the 1st CD and throw the second CD away."
2,Michael Jackson CD Collection,"The shipment was very fast, however, the product (first CD, track#10) was defected as it skips beats for about 1-2 minutes.I work long hours and commute long time, and I had to fly over to another State for vacation, so I didn't bother to exchange the CD.I always love Michael Jackson songs, so if track#10 did not skip, I would have given 5 stars for sure.The collection itself is all famous, easy to listen to and upbeat songs.Thank you."
4,Good but inconsistent,"CD1 speaks for itself, you all know the story.CD2 is half brilliant, half crap.GOOD SONGS:ScreamStranger In MoscowEarth SongCome TogetherYou Are Not AloneChildhood2BadLittle SuzieBAD SONGS:They Don't Care About UsThis Time AroundTabloid JunkieD.S.SmileMoneyHIStoryI Am a huge fan of the king of pop, but his eccentricity gets too much on some of the songs. he needs to sit down with some folk and decide which songs make the album and which don't. Dangerous, HIStory, Blood On The Dancefloor and Invincible all clock in at over 75 minutes which is way too long for an album.Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad which are easily his best 3 albums are all killer and no filler, and are all less than 50 minutes long.QUALITY not QUANTITYALL KILLER and NO FILLERonly then will MJ reclaim his rightly deserved throne"
3,Nothing really speical,"I have to say that is was not one of his best works.. If you are a true fan you will feel slighted on the greatest hit disc that some of his better tunes off the Thriller, Off the Wall, Bad albums were left off .. The 2nd disc of newer material is slight only a few songs stand out ..The R.Kelly Produced Your are not a loneThis time aroundThe Beatles's true to form remake of Come Together after this there isnt much more .."
2,Where's Dirty Diana?,"HIStory would have been a necessary purchase if Micahael Jackson would have decided to with hold all of the new material, and just released the greatest hits. He also should have put Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal on this cd. Dirty Diana was a #1 hit!! Michael could have put one or two new songs on this cd, Scream is good, You are not alone is decent, but the second disc is torture to listen to the whole way through. Buy Bad and Thriller."
3,Under the shadow,"With an unstoppable first disc of super-duper hits, it takes a pretty inept follow through to render this pompous portrait unworthy, and while HIStory 2 didn't totally wreck image (after all, a few powerful numbers exist- Earth Song arguably being his last stab at anthemic pop brilliance) a majority of sodded techno, pulsating to Jackson's angry tirades attempting to stay relevant, with a side order of sappy Broadway sentiment berates the infectious pop purity he used to seemingly summon at whim."
4,Michael Jackson Rulz,"Hi,i would like to say that anything that has anything to do with Michael Jackson is the best, and personly love the song history...."
4,The history of Michael jackson's songs,"I liked this album. Because it had all kind of songs,so it wasn't boring .And I liked Michael Jackson's voice.( The part like the hickups) Also I could listen to his past songs and his present songs is this one album. Actually two CD's. First, I didn't like him. But after I heard this album. I thought he is really good at singing. However, I think this album is good to listen for every age's My father likes this, too. I'll rate four stars for this album."
2,HIS?,"I will not criticize him for not coming up with another Thriller or Off The Wall. It would be impossible for anyone to come close to those two. However, I do object to the deification of Jackson. I simply do not care what the rich and famous think of him. He is a great and talented performer but he is in no way the second coming."
3,How to enjoy History:,"1. Buy the album.2. Throw away disc 2.3. Listen to disc 1.4. Avoid ""The Girl is Mine."""
3,HIStory Michael Jackson,"I ordered this as a result of listening to [...]. The song titles looked great. As I listen to the CD I realize I'm not that familiar with a lot of the songs. The CD case keeps falling apart.HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I"
4,for the true fan,"bought this for myself but ended up giving it to my son in law who loves MJ, he loves it just as I did !"
4,Classic Michael Jackson,"I had heard a few Michael Jackson songs just like everyone else. (Thriller, black and white etc.) The first disc of the two set cd was absolutely incredible. The songs are immediate hits and seem to stick in your mind like honey. Billy Jean is a perfect song to lead off the track because of a great beat and meaningful lyrics. These are followed by classics such as the way you make me feel, bad and the best of the best, THRILLER. THis cd is an instant hit whether you be old and wanting a look into the past or a kid looking for a good beat to dance to. THe second cd in the set it much weaker hence my 4 star rating. The tracks seem to drag on a little bit and do not have the instant likeable sound of the first cd. They are not the #1 hits heard by all of the world but some new and unreleased tracks. Stay away from cd 2 but cd 1 is an instant classic for everyone. Classic Michael. Buy it and you will be satisfied."
3,half and half,"The reason why this CD received 3 stars is because the first CD is great. I love all of the old Micheal Jackson tunes like ""Billy Jean"",""Bad"",""Remember The Time"". Although the first CD is great, it did not include a couple of MJ hits (Smooth Criminal and PYT). Anyway, I think that MJ should have just left it a greatest hits compilation. There are too many new songs in HIStory. I really did not care for the second CD."
3,The Man Or His Music?,"It is impossible to listen to this without images of tabloid life. The music is among his finest although one might quibble over which hits on disc one to include. I guess disc two was a reaction to media circus. Even with all of this man's accomplishments, he remains very inaccessible and you have to wonder..."
5,Best Michael Jackson Cd's out there.,"This double CD set is the greatest music from the ""king of pop"" of his career in my opinion. 1st CD is of his number 'ONES' . All his chart topping No. 1 Singles - great stuff! The stores are selling this CD separately entitled 'Ones'.....15 hits!. Why buy that when you can have 2 CD's with 30 songs total.The 2nd CD in my opinion is the absolute best single CD he ever put out. He was very upset in 1995 about his recent accusations and it reflects in his music. Making this a very emotional compilation of 15 new songs. Every one of these songs has a message for all of us about what he was experiencing. Incredible CD! and a must have!Highly recommended!!!"
5,Underrated and NOT what you'd expect!,"Considering this is the most expensive album ever recorded,Michael makes it one for the Guiness Book Of Records!This two-disk whopper starts with a CD of well-remastered greatest hits,some of the greatest music recorded in it's time and mostlyfeaturing the superb production of Quincy Jones.But the next diskof all new songs is an ENTIRELY different animal.All of MJ's newmusic in 1995 was angry,bitter and hard edged as he bluntlydemanded to be left alone in ""Scream"",asking to ""stop pressuringme"",losing hope of the biting ""They Don't Care About Us"" andthe vital ""Earth Song"" and scarring us half to death with thehighly morbid ""Little Susie""-pretty charged-up stuff.Consideringhis still very new child abuse allegations this level of bitterness seems appropriate.It's on a par with John Lennon's""Plastic Ono Band"" or Marvin Gayes ""Here,My Dear"" in emmotionalscope and while musically it isn't exactly perfect it does havemany,many moments.Worth it!"
5,KING OF POP AND SOUL,"i absolutley love this CD. its the most used one in my cd collection. Everybody should learn to appreciate michale jackson and his stlye of music because he isnt going to be around forever and people dont knwo what they are missing out on. he is the best entertainer that has ever lived and this albumn reflects that. all of his songs have a meaning, some more important than others. But each and every one of his songs is unique and brilliant. All those of oyu who are comtemplating wether to buy it or not, i say yes!!! and like elizabeth taylor said "" michael jackson is the true king of opo and soul."" so go out there and buy this CD, you wont regret it"
4,"HIStory, the end of the Beginning, The Beginning of the End","HIStory is by all means a high quality album, but I deny it 5 stars because of a few stains. Michael changes from a family-friendly artist to a bitter, cursing, angry figure. The album has only one true love song, a great change from Michael's previous albums. The album also must be purchased with previously recorded material, which drives the price higher. The quality and sheer contagiousness of the tracks on HIStory makes it a notable album. The tracks do provide more insight into Michael's thinking and deal with real issues rather than issue the typical love-ballad feel. Even with it's minor drawbacks, HIStory is a must for the Michael Jackson fan."
3,What should have been and was not included....,"The first CD is pretty good, but I just HAVE to say to whoever is out there that I want a better ""best of"" mix....***What I (and a lot of other people) didn't want:-She's out of my life-I just can't stop loving you-Heal the world (This is a throwback to the campiness of the hippy movement.... Earth song on the 2nd disc is much better music with much better lyrics and nearly the same message)***What I don't care about:-The Girl is mine-Remember the Time (How did this get on the CD when ""Will you be there"" failed to?)***What I REQUIRE for the next compilation:-Smooth Criminal (ACK!! This is one of his best, but I dont wanna buy ""Moonwalker!"")-Will you be there (This is was a huge hit, I thought it was curious it didn't make the cut)-Jam (Love it...)-Who is it (Underrated)-Human Nature (probably his best ballad from the period)"
5,Listening Pleasure!!!,I purchase this CD for my boyfriend and he loves it. He listens to the CD every morning while riding to work. It is Michael Jackson at his best. All M.J. fans should own this collection.
4,"The past, present and future since Michael","I bought the vinyl version. Three discs that tell an exciting solo career full of great successes. The past is rich and overwhelming, with hits taken from the album: ""Off the Wall"", ""Thriller,"" ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous."" The present and the future that are read with music arranged by Jackson with electronic sounds and overwhelming rhythm, interrupting the vortex of pop music with slow and reflective ballads. An album that embodies the creative capacity of the ""King of Pop""."
5,HIStory...,"It's a remarkable and well-done album, 2 CD, one is greatest songs and another is his new songs. They show his most creativity and attention in his music world, perhaps too heavy-topic won't to be so good. Hope his next Millenium will show us a new perception and music-concept."
5,Truly the King of Pop!,"I absolutely love this album. Michael Jackson truly is the King of Pop. Most people more than likely know most of these songs, since almost all of them have been in the top charts at one time or another. Many of the songs have an awesome beat, and they come over very powerful with Michael's strong vocals. There are also a variety of his most popular soft songs, which are mainly about poor children, since Michael has supported many childrens organizations. My personal favorites on these two CD's are ""Billie Jean"", ""Man in the Mirror"", ""They don't care about us"", ""Stranger in Moscow"", ""Earth Song"", ""Come together"", and ""2 Bad"". However, in the end they are all very good; I definetely recommend this CD."
4,4 1/2 Stars...,"This double cd creation by Michael Jackson is wonderful, no doubt. However, following the events of the early nineties, Michael Jackson became jaded by the terrible events which slandered his name. This departure from innocence is painfully obvious on HIStory. It was slightly painful to listen to Michael's absence of joyfulness which used to pepper his albums. That's why this album gets only a 4 1/2."
4,For new MJ fans,"The quality of the songs in this cd is great. I bought this cd simply because I liked the majority of the songs in this album. The song ""smile"" was the bonus. I also liked the cd booklet inside. It contains alot of nice pictures, and is like his scrapbook of his life. Oprah and Chelsea Clinton is in it...but not Lisa Marie? Anyway, there is little more to add because the songs inside the album are well known already. So you can critique the music yourself. :)"
3,First disc History...the rest...not quite,"The first disc of HISTORY is worthwhile. It features 15 of Michael Jackson's biggest hits, including Billie Jean, Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, The Way You Make Me Feel, Black or White, and more. The second disc is a collection of 15 new songs. Unfortunately, it is spotty at best. There are some great songs here. Notably ""Scream"" (duet with sister Janet Jackson), Stranger In Moscow, They Don't Care About Us, etc. The rest of them fall between being overly sappy (You Are Not Alone, Childhood, HIStory, Smile) to very bitter sounding (Tabloid Junkie, D.S.). Luckily they released disc one on its own, so you can get all the hits, without the waste of a second cd."
5,THIS IS DEFINITELY HIS MOST PERSONAL ALBUM!,"Few people ever wonder what was going through MICHAEL JACKSON'S mind during the allegations. Isn't there any part of you that itches to know what this guy thought of the whole ordeal? You will find the answers in this nothing-is-barred album, which has found its place as Jackson's most personal album yet by far. It's like a book where the beginning is Jackson's GREATEST HITS (disc 1), a powerful, mystic force of sheer groove. The middle is what we would call his allegation period. The aftermath of this is HISTORY (disc 2). As for words to describe this part, listen and figure that out for yourself."
4,lords of flatbush,lords of flatbush this was a real good movie I'm 15 I saw this movie about 2-3 years ago I kept rewinding it rewinding it.Slvester Stallons first movie he acted good in the movie it had some good fight sceans.You have to see it it's a good movie.
1,Poor plot,"""The Lords of Flatbush"" stars actor Sylvester Stallone. This film however was made before Stallone's breakthrough in ""Rocky"".""The Lords of Flatbush"" is about four guys who chase girls, steal cars and hang out at malt shops. This film has a very poor plot and Stallone's acting is not what it is later on in his career."
1,A Snooze,"Just could not keep awake during this turkey. Sly Stallone and his buddies just mumble their way through this mess. I can't even call this a comming of age movie as none of these characters show any signs of maturity. Yes, Chico actually appears interested in one lady but there still seems to be no meaning in their relationship.This is one BORING movie."
3,A Cult Film composed of sub-plots,"First of all, Stallone and Winkler both give solid performances as street hoodlums on the verge of manhood. Perry King and Paul Mace are good as well, making this cast quite first-rate.This film is entertaining as long as one doesn't expect anything that remotely resembles a plot. An amagamation of subplots serves to fill the void, and the film somehow works. It's exactly as billed in the trailer, sung as a doo-wop tune: ""The Lords of Flatbush is a movie / About what life was like back in the fifties"".Well, that lyric says it all.This film will not cure any ailments, but if you want to know what started the careers of Stallone and Winkler, look no further. It's entertaining, quite well acted, and insightful regarding the lives and outlooks of kids coming of age in the late 1950's."
2,MC Jackets,"Amazon threw Flatbush in with a bunch of ""Motorcycle"" movies. Flatbush is a ""Motorcycle Jacket"" movie. It was OK to see the Stars in their Pre-Star era, but it's still not a ""Motorcycle"" movie."
4,Could be a lifesaver---,"This system has lots of features and seems reasonably well-built. Radio reception is mediocre especially on the weather band which is a definite weakness but if you work with it, decent reception is possible. The unit is big and heavy but having a built-in power system necessitates a battery of this size. Otherwise, all features seem to work as advertised."
4,Hopefully Useful,"This item has a lot of features in a relatively small and compact unit. But (thankfully) I have not needed to use all these features. I did try the air compressor, which worked to inflate the tires on my bicycle. The lights are bright and the unit does have two AC outlets.If everything works as advertised, then this is a great item at a good price!We'll see."
1,Yuck,"As with everyone else, the loud clicking and electronic smell when charging set in on the second use. The first time it worked great. No weather cahnnel reception though. Got it for camping and checked it out thoroughly when it came in. Charged it and all was well. Then didn't need it for months. Pulled it out the second time and it was dead. So it didn't hold the charge from the first use. Plugged it in and the clicking started. Then it started to smell, but at least no smoke or fire. And it just wont take a charge. But the components seem to work when plugged in. So unless the smell gets to me, I can use it plugged in."
1,Great potential unrealized,"I've gone through 7 of these units, all defective. First one had the thermometer type upside down, and to make a long story short, loud clicking on 3 while charging (failed), smoke from one, etc. Nice looking unit with great features, but the stupid thing is an engineering failure. The company will probably send me and 8th unit, but I don't think it will be the charm. Avoid this product like the plague!"
3,Good CD,Trent's song 'Too Close To The Fire' is worth buying the CD for alone. I liked about half the songs on the CD and would rate it a good buy.
1,Apparently Abridged,"NOTE: This review is of this edition of the book, and not the novel itself, which is one of my favorites. Everyone should read it; just find a better edition.When I bought this book in a store, I *thoroughly* inspected the cover for the word ""abridged"". It was nowhere in sight. So I bought it, assuming it was an unabridged edition of the novel. I was wrong. As I started to read, it became apparent that it was in fact an abridged edition. Needless to say, this angered me a little. I don't like being lied to, and this certainly was a lie of omission. I won't be buying any books from the Barnes and Noble Classics line ever again. I'll just have to assume they've all been edited to leave out the ""boring bits"". This book really deserves better."
2,Boring,"I found the first 1/3 of the book to be very compelling and couldnt really put it down; however, the middle of the book is bogged down in mind numbing details of no consequence, a myriad of characters with multiple names and titles, and numerous subplots not pertaining to the central theme. I soon became bored and started speed reading, hoping that the story would pick up the pace again, but alas, it never did. By the time I got to the end, the story had lost all its punch and I'd completely lost interest. Would not recommend it."
2,An excessive abridgment that is hard to justify,"Positives: The writing style for this translation flows very well. Luckily for this abridgment, many of the entertaining conversations are preserved.Negatives: I don't understand how B&N; could let this botched abridgment make its way to the printing press. This abridgment was so reckless I had to buy and re-read the full version. Nowhere on the cover does it say that the novel is abridged. The introduction before the text seems to admit that the abridgment is made short to accommodate a modern audience (are modern readers really that dull?). In this case over half the original novel is either excluded or paraphrased. The unabridged version takes a lot of patience to read, but it makes Monte Cristo's intricate plotting of financial ruin easier to understand. Large conspiracies need literary room in order to be comprehended.If you are serious about reading Count of Monte Cristo for the complete story, I do not recommend buying this B&N; version."
2,Terrible Version of a Classic,"I have read many different versions of The Count of Monte Cristo, and honestly this version is probably the worst. For a 600+ page abridgement, it leaves out quite a bit of the story which just should not be necessary, particularly as much of the more descriptive/unnecessary elements are left in. While those descriptions truly enhance the work in its entirety, if one must read an abridged version, perhaps they could be left out in order to tell a more full story. Even someone not familiar with the full work would probably pick up on this, as certain parts appear rushed or unresolved (the equivalent to a television show writing out a character by simply mentioning they died off camera and never bringing it up again). I'm not trying to say you have to read the whole, long thing (though I'd recommend it), simply that if you're looking for an abridged version, look elsewhere."
5,Seon Scarlatti,"Originally published on the Seon label in 1979, this is my favorite recording of Scarlatti's sonatas, each paired off according to Kirkpatrick's research. Leonhardt's interpretations are excellent and the clarity is amazing. The only negative thing I can say is that it's way too short. The K.3 present here far surpasses any that I've heard."
4,I disagree! It's good!,"I disagree with those who say this is not a good book and that it is uninspired, etc. This book is very good and in my opinion quite different from the first book in the series. A bunch of new and interesting characters are introduced as well. If you like the first in the series, you will like this too. I couldn't put it down!"
3,disappointing,"Not up to her usual standards. As an earlier reader wrote, obviously giving us a lot of information pertinent to the next book, but this one doesn't have her usual 'grab'."
1,Bored In Space,"I have enjoyed all the previous E. Moon books but this one leaves me yawning. Trite, slow and mundane. If you want a detailed description of life aboard a cargo ship, the book is okay. Half way through, I tossed the book because I don't care about the plot or the characters."
2,So-So,Elizabeth Moon is a self-hating fishbelly.If you can overlook that trite PC episode -- which I almost couldn't -- you will find this book on balance enjoyable.
3,Flopped a bit at the end,"So far, this has been the most interesting and fast paced book in this series. It was doing great until about page 300 when killer!Ky, ditzy!Stella, and angsty!Rafe lost all of their character development in the book and returned to their original 2-D selves. The set up for Ky to start taking charge of her navy was weak as well.Overall, this was still a fairly likable read."
4,Good action passtime,"As with all the books in this series, Moon keeps things moving most of the time, with a few slow side trips. Read for entertainment."
5,Amazing Album,This is an amazing album. Took me a minute to warm up to it but its really really good. Very White Trash Rob and very punk rock & roll ish.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I bought one three years ago, and I notice no difference at all. I recently bought a new phone with horrible reception (a Motorola RAZR; yeah, don't buy one). So I switched the little antenna booster from my old phone to the new RAZR thinking since the antenna booster didn't do a thing for my old phone, maybe now it would finally be useful!! BUT NO, the RAZR still sucks, and the bottom line is this: the reception on your cell phone is going to depend on the cell phone itself. A little rectangular piece of tape with gold paint on it isn't going to make any difference..."
1,Universal Cell Phone Reception Antenna Booster,"Simply put, this product was not worth the $1.99 I spent. It is simply a gold sticker. I tried this product on three seperate occasions in three different areas and still nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,cell phone antenna stickers DO NOT work!,doesn't work at all and actaully made the reception I did have worse!! I do not reccomend wasting your money on this item!
1,Cell Phone reception booster,"This product made no difference at all in my cell phone reception. Cell Phone is a Nokia 9300, service is through ATT"
1,Wheres my order?,"I have been waiting, seems too long? I want to rate this Item, But I haven't gotten it? Can anyone help?"
1,Junk!,I thought these would at least have enough metal content to be able to wire them to the external antenna plug but they seem to be some form of metallic paint. Don't waste your time or money!
1,of course it didn't work,I had to give it a shot at $2+ but if it were that easy to increase the gain of the phone antenna the manufactures would already have installed. It did nothing.
1,Completely useless...do not waste your time.,"Anyone who thinks this actually works is completely insane. How does it connect with your phone antenna? Holding your phone differently will do the trick if your hand is somehow interfering with radio reception. If you have one installed please remove it before you take your phone for servicing...they will know you are a fool, will laugh and probably take you for a ride!!!"
2,Overhyped.,"This didn't work as described. It was helping by around 10 decibels, but not a significant change as it says in the description."
4,I didn't expect much...,"I did not expect much from this product, and I was even more suspicious because of the price, but I swear it works. My phone went from being useless at home to lousy. I got one for my father and he noticed better signal quality too. I want some thing that will improve cellphone reception even more, but this definitely works."
5,this is the good one,I've order 3 diferent antenna boosters but this is the best its twice as big compare to the others fits in my razor V3xx and i realy dont have any problems with droped calls or low recepcion inside my house anymore.
5,Smart and Funny,I thought this book was fun and informative. The author has lots of good ideas about journal writing for preteen girls. She gets them psyched without talking down to them. Plus the design of the book is very fun and interesting. I bought this book for my niece and she still goes back to the book for more ideas.
1,One punch line joke.,"The message in this book is exactly what the title says & very little more. Writing goals is very important, but basically that is all this book says. If you are into this kind of stuff, this book is very very basic."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed as a seasoned Oracle user/DBA to get abook which covers basics too much and new features too little.
4,Good for the basics,"This book is excellent to know the basics of the Oracle 10g Administration, as its name says, is a complete reference about the whole database software, includes a big part of PL/SQL and complete chapters about tuning tips and security, It's a must for an Oracle DBA, but I put only 4 stars because I think Lonely tried to cover a lot of things in this book, and obvious, it only mention the keys for eache point; and if you want the complete solution for one topic, you need to consult other resureces like OTN. Whatever, is an excelent reference."
2,OK service,the product was damaged on the sides but I don't want to return it because that would delay my time to study it. but the things required to study are intact.
3,Redundant Information,If you have Google and Oracle Support then this book is not essential for any reason. It does not get very detailed or offer many alternatives/workarounds. For instance it will explain the SGA and what the parameters are used for but it will not tell you in what instance you would need to hand tune the parameters yourself. Maybe I was expecting too much but make sure that you aren't either.
3,Oracle is Oracle,The book speaks on most of the database issues that can come up when using Oracle. It is more of a Reference manual instead of going to each topic in detail. This can be useful when one wanted to quickly get the relevent information.
1,CD-ROM?,"As a DBA who travels around the country constantly, my main reason for purchasing this book was the CD-ROM which claims to contain a copy of the book in pdf format along with code examples. Imagine my surprise when I found the included CD is blank. The book is for the office, the CD for the road. Osborne needs to get their act together. I haven't a clue how to get a good CD without returning the book.I'm updating my review to give Amazon 5 stars for customer service. They sent me a new book with a readable CD before I returned the bad one!! They even paid the shipping to get the bad one back. Thanks!!"
3,Not so complete...,"With a 1200+ page book, entitled ""The Complete Reference"", I would have expected much more information about proper configuration. Properly configuring Oracle (I'm running it on Unix) is no trivial matter and I found this book to be severely lacking. While it seems like a good reference to have (hence 3 / 5 stars), it looks like I'm going to have to look for other resources."
2,Disappointed--tries to cover too much,"This sounded like a good book, judging by the reviews here, but being relatively new to the Oracle world, I haven't found this book terribly useful so far. Oracle's docs have been much more helpful and detailed. I was hoping for a book that shared the author's experience and tips and helped the reader make decisions, but this seems to be largely a command reference, covering many topics superficially."
1,He's laughing at you,"The basic premise of the book is that you chant ""Thiru Neela Kantam"" as a ""karma busting mantram"" and chant ""Om Na Ma Shi Va Ya"" to ""improve every aspect of your life"" and also improve ""the entire planet"".The author sells horoscope analysis services, special beads, yantras, CDs, and a host of other products to make HIM rich. He also reccomends you go to India for his special services(God, I wonder what that costs?).You should get the idea; here's the real way to get rich: Write a book, get a bunch of phony testimonials from friends or write them yourself, and use the phony book to sell other phony products. I would give this a negative star rating if it were possible."
2,going blind!,"I really looked forward to getting this book and wish I had read the reviews first. While I can enjoy the overall design of the maps, I certainly found my enjoyment lessened by the fact that I cannot read the print on most of them, even with a magnifying glass. This, in turn, lessened the appeal of the text. Just a mess, to be honest.Didn't any editor notice the size of the print on the maps? Or are they sight-impaired?I am just glad that I only paid $8 for this, used, including shipping."
3,Better to behold than to read,This sumptuous volume of maps covers the topic from a broad perspective. The illustrations are many and pleasing to the eye. But the book seems meant to be displayed on a coffee table as it is almost too heavy to hold and read comfortably. The writing is pedestrian.
1,poor binding,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. He browsed through it a time or two and recently picked it up to read more thoroughly. When he opened it, the back spine broke and opened completely, leaving the internal spine to secure the book. This was a great disappointment, since the maps in the book are fascinating. We've recently begun studying Roman history via some Teaching Company courses and thought this book would be a wonderful reference. Hopefully, a replacement will be sturdier."
3,The Map Book,I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old grandaughter. It was way above her level but there was no way to look inside the book without ordering it nor was there any age recommendations for the purchase. It is indeed a beautiful book and maybe helpful to her in high school or college.
4,Ruth Understood,"The Book of Ruth has always been a book that I didn't always quite get, but I loved the romance of it. I wanted to do a study on it, and this was one of the few books on Ruth I could find. I'd done a study of Esther by the same author, so I knew it would be good.It did explain some things to me that I'd never understood before (like the significance of Ruth covering herself at Boaz's feet), and helped me see things from Ruth's perspective. The author goes into the background of the culture of that time, so we understand where the people are coming from.Overall, I'd say this is an excellent book for a women's home group. More than just romance, this study shows how God provides for us in the most dire circumstances."
3,great!,"This is exactly what I wanted for my 4 year old son, he wanted to be a ninja for halloween but also is so into camo. Fits great and very true to the size on package. Only issue I have with it, is getting it off him."
3,Very nice watch for the money but,"Very nice looking watch but it didn't last a month. The dial that pops up above the face of the watch broke off. Couldn't be fixed so it's garbage now. I won't be buying another one. Shame, it's very nice for the money but the face is not durable enough and sticks up too high allowing for it to snag on anything and break off. Definitely wouldn't get it for someone younger."
3,A Note re the sound quality,"I won't go into a complete review other than to say that I find the Gasdia set greatly superior to the Fleming. One reason is that the sound quality on the Fleming is poor. Whoever engineered her live performance should find another profession. The Gasdia is in beautiful sound. Since no other review mentioned sound quality, I think you should be advised of same...."
1,HORRIBLE---HUGE WASTE OF MONEY,We purchased two of these safes for our daughters for Christmas and they both broke within 3 weeks. Don't waste your money!!!!!
2,My child was disappointed.,"After the safe arrived my son was very excited to use his new toy. Unfortunately, one of the key features the toy promises, setting your own secret code/combination to open the safe does not function. Neither he or any of the three adults in the room were able to reprogram it to the numbers he chose. He was very sad about it but after waiting so long for it to arrive by mail, would not return it. Since it arrived at my home I have researched other reviews at Amazon. You already have product reviews stating the same complaint. This is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised. It should be taken off your item list until it has been fixed. As it stands Amazon is selling a low quality item to young children and parents who are very disappointed."
2,Not worth the money,"This safe is a cute idea, but not worth the money. First of all, if you drop the safe from about 2"" off the ground, it will automatically open (so big sister doesn't need the code to get in). Also, items in the safe get lost behind the drawer and you have to disassemble (unscrew) to get items out. Again, cute idea, but needs some fixing."
1,laser beam safe a disappointment,"My son saw this product in a toy catalog and asked for it for X-mas. He thought it actually had a fingerprint scanner on it. In actuality, it has a light beam that is turned on and off by the combination pad. The fingerprint button is merely a button. So my son was totally disappointed. He said he would have been happy if it made believe it scanned your fingerprint with some kind of light effect or a voice command that said fingerprint scanned.In addition, there is a poorly constructed shelf inside the safe and somehow a twenty dollar bill slipped behind it. We would have to break the outer plastic to get retrieve the twenty.All in all, a disappoitment to my son, who collects safes. So we had to buy a different metal safe with a combination to appease him."
2,Poorly made - Not worth the $$$,Not worth the money. Items easily get stuck behind the drawer and the safe opens when dropped or stricken. Since we received it the safe has not allowed us to reset of the password no matter how many times we tried.
1,you never know,"you never know what to expect. Sometimes it will open, sometimes not. Better not put anything too important in there. Yesterday when we came home the alarm was activated and it seemed as tho it had been on for some time. It is a great concept for a product, but the reality is very annoying and loud."
3,It may have lasted until he got home,This was cute and the grandson got a great thrill out of it. It was pretty cheaply made so I'm not sure how long it will last. It arrived in great shape and was an immediate winner with great approval.
1,Save Your Child Heartache. Do not buy this.,My son was crying tonight because he couldn't open his safe and get out his valuables. I tried repeatedly and could not also. I tried googleing the company to see if there is a release somewhere but I cannot even find the company on the web. Save your child heartache. Do not buy this.
1,Very poor quality product,"Very poor quality product.The knives are very small, not a usual size. They made of a very thin steel, you can bend them easily. They feel unbalanced and hard to hold in your hand. A 99 cent store Chinese knife has better quality than these. Stay away from these knives."
5,Liberals in Denial,"Reagan's war is a great historical work which proves not only that Ronald Reagan was the man, but how liberals were on the wrong side of history."
5,Outstanding research: confirms what many already knew!,"Peter Schweizer follows up his great book _Victory_ with another hit. Schweizer goes into great detail to describe Reagan's decades-long battle against Communism and uses recently declassified archives from former Communist countries to paint a vivid picture.We now understand why the left was so earnest in its objections to Reagan's policies towards Communism. If the Soviet Union ever fell the left would lose one of its greatest allies and the world would learn the truth about their treasonous alliance against Reagan and the right.A timely release, and puts Carter's Nobel prize in yet another unflattering scene. Carter going hat-in-hand to the Soviets for help against Reagan is one of the worst acts of treason this country has evern witnessed, surpassed only by the original American traitor, Benedict Arnold.A must read!"
5,How one man made the difference!,"This book is the story of how one man fought the Soviet Union for most of his adult life, entering politics to bring them down--and doing it! The documentation from the old Soviet and East Bloc Secret Police archives, as well as top secret directives of our OWN Government, recently declassified, lend a measure of veracity to the story that only the most determined Reagan-bashers could deny! HIGHLY recommended!"
4,Eye Opening,"This book certainly opened my eyes to the central role President Reagan played in the rolling back of the Soviet Empire and the eventual victory of the United States in the Cold War. Buy this book for yourself and learn of a courageous man who stood up to Communists in the film industry who threatened both him and his family, and who stuck to his ideal of freedom for all oppressed peoples throughout his long political career.As for the one star review below, it neatly illustrates Ann Coulter's pointing out that many of the arguments put forth by (hyper)liberals can basically be reduced to ""You're stupid!"" Granted, an amazon.com review forum hasn't the space for a full refutation, but you'd think s/he could've given SOME concrete fact which the book got wrong or SOME specific instance in which s/he disagrees with the author's reasoning."

4,Great Season IMO,I liked this season. I liked Mac Danzig and a couple other guys. Though Serra was annoying as all hell :).
2,Pfaltgraff,Product was delivered on time and in one piece. It does not last though. A few uses and I could see it starting to break. Not for outside or children's parties.
5,Worth every penny,"Ocean Avenue came out ages ago, and yet I still listen to all the songs. I liked it for the catchy tunes and good vocals. Lights and Sounds is almost nothing like Ocean Avenue as a whole, but it's not bad in any way at all. Songs like ""Two Weeks From Twenty"" and ""Words, Hands, Hearts"" are relevant to current living in the world. ""Martin Sheen or JFK,"" ""Waiting Game,"" and ""Down on my Head"" are some of my favorites, although I'm sure at least one of these songs will be permanantly imprinted in your mind. The ""New Sound"" is still purely Yellowcard and only sacrifice ""poppy tunes"" for more mature lyrics which sound just as good. Your wait has finally ended."
5,"If you like Yellowcard, or just good music","This is an absolutely great CD. Yellowcard has a great sound, and they've expanded on it with this CD, while still making it so you can listen and say, yes thats Yellowcard. The music is talented and lyrics are meaningful. If you haven't given Yellowcard a chance yet, give them this one, and I'm sure you'll be hunting for their older stuff."
4,"amazing new album, i love it","this is a great album, especially the title song, Lights and Sounds. that's gotta be one of my new favorite songs now. Three Flights Up is also amazing, especially for an instrumental. another great song is Down On My Head, its very much like their older stuff. if you're a fan of their older songs, you'll love this cd. there are still great songs that are similar to the ones on Ocean Avenue, too. the bonus DVD is great, and definately worth the extra $5"
1,Worst.CD player.Ever,"It seems GPX did almost the bare minimum necessary to make a device that actually plays CDs. Features that I thought would be standard for any CD player were noticeably lacking. When you stopped the CD player and restarted it it would not queue up to the point at which it stopped - it would start over from the very beginning. Also, it would change the volume setting back to near minimum. Most of the time I found that unless it was held perfectly still and level, it would have problems actually getting the CD to start playing. And if it lost its tracking it would never recover. These ""features"" are pretty much antithetical to those you'd want for a CD player for a car.After a few weeks of fighting with it I chose to buy a low-end Sony Discman for about the same price, and that works far, far better. I wouldn't recommend buying this CD player unless you need a stand-in for a movie stunt in which you didn't want to damage a real CD player."
2,Inadequate,"The best thing about this package is the accessories. The CD player itself is temperamental and inadequate.The cassette adapter, stereo ear buds, and cigarette lighter plug do indeed allow listeners to play CDs while on the road. We bought the player to avoid running a battery-operated CD player while in the car. The plug powers the CD player, and the listener can use the earbuds to listen to something other than the music on the main stereo system. That part works fine.The problem is that the CD player is unreliable. It doesn't always play. It requires a firm bang with the fist to get it going.Other CD players we looked at in this round cost about $10 or $15. This one ran us $25. It would have been worth it if the cigarette lighter-power-adapter worked well with other cd players too. But it doesn't.A definite bust."
2,Smaller than they Appear Here,"Good price and my wife liked them, but the diamonds are very... very small. I would say they appear here 10x larger than they are."
2,Short lifespan,"This is my tenth year of wearing compression hose. I am 6 feet tall with 15"" calves, 8 1/2"" ankles and 11 1/2 shoe size. I purchased the medium, closed toe. The fit is pretty good with just enough toe room for my shoe size. Not too hard to get on or off. I wear a cotton sock over them to extend the life and to eliminate odor issues.After 5 months of twice a week washing in hot water and air drying they are starting to come apart. The compression is also starting to wane in the ankle area. I own two other brands that have gone through several years of the same treatment with no issues."
1,"Save your money, a very poor read!!","It is this reader's opinion that ""Queen of Angels"" is one of the worst Science Fiction books ever written. I could not get past chapter 11 without the urge to throw it out a window. Certainly not up to the standards of Greg Bear as displayed in ""Eon"", ""Eternity"", ""Moving Mars"" etc. The characters are thin uninteresting and nondescript. The plot is not self evident and the overabundance of miniscule data and non defined abreviations, attempting to outline a society of tomorrow falls short, leaves the reader with the felling that he has entirely missed points not clearly represented. A very bad read, regardless of the commercial reviews. Save your money on this one!"
3,ambitious but flawed,"Bear's ambition attempt at pushing the boundaries of SF succeeds and fails at the same time. Grappling with large issues of the nature of evil, AI self-consciousness and the direction humanity is taking, Bear tries but doesn't quite pull it off. The stylistic quirks become annoying after some time, and the middle section plods on. Fortunately, it redeems itself at the end, and the last 1/3 of the book is fascinating"
3,"slow start, dragging line, little redemption","Wonderful concepts of near-future society... the same society based on Bear's short story Sisters in his collection Tangents. Expansive qualities about the society, person-to-person relationships, country-to-country relationships, etc. It's all good in the like. But, the plot starts slow and confused me. It actually got me angry because of the idiosyncratic typing for some of the characters. It pans out eventually. Another dislike of mine is the inclusion of poetry from characters in the story... and the inclusion of invented fables. If Bear were to stick to technology and sociology, it would have been a good novel (maybe 4 stars)."
2,A story without a plot.,"i realy wanted to like this book when I checked it out from the library. But it tries so hard to be new, cutting edge and in your face I found myself not caring if any of the characters live or die. I finished it and the ending was ""meh"". Not a horible book, but a boring one."
5,Another low-light champion!!,"You've got to try this camera to know what I'm talking about. Pictures came out clean and rich.Now, let's talk about the blurring issue. In fact there is no such problem because everybody should agree with me that you don't shake your camera immediately before/after you shoot. And even after a shot(in low-light, indoors) you need to give a time to the shutter lag to close. This shutter lag is slow but we are more concerned about picture quality than anything else.My low light pitures are like WOW! When I show them to people they think it's done in daytime. I won't talk much. My dear friend JUST GO AND BUY IT.You can't regret it. Period!"
3,Don't expect to point and shoot,"I got this for Xmas, and have spent the day playing with it. I was on the verge of returning it, but I've decided to keep it. Here's the trick... The ISO or sensitivity setting determines how sensitive the camera is to light. A high setting is good in very low light or, I guess, if the shutter is opening and closing very quickly. If you let the M20 decide for itself what setting to use then it will choose one that is too high. 200 is probably good for indoors, for example, but the camera will choose 400. This results in a picture with lots of ""noise""; dark areas will have spots of light, etc. I think that this is what people are calling blurriness. Choose the sensitivity manually and the pictures are fine. Still, if the 6MP Sony is comparable in price, I'd probably lean toward it."
3,So far Not so Good......,"I really like this camera - it has everything I need, and it takes good pictures. I received it in the Mail around March 5th 1007 - it went into the shop May 1st because the something is apparently wrong with the flash mechanism preventing the shutter to release in any mode that requires a flash. The problem is too big for the local shop to fix, so they are sending the camera to the factory. They said it will probably be weeks before I get it back. Not a good start. I was even more disheartened to see that 4 of the 6 cameras for sale in the display at the repair shop (because people who dropped them off for repairs didn't pick them up) were Pentax digitals (but not M20's).I hope when I get it back I will have years of trouble-free use, but as of now I'm not feeling good about my purchase.I'll write an update in the future."
4,"Great color, easy to use",I have had this camera for over a year and have take about 1000photos with it. Almost all in Auto mode. Pictures have great colorsaturation. Focus is good - not significant blurriness excepton horizon in some distant lanscape shots recently. Perhaps I need to take a close look and clean my lens which I know has caused me bluriness problems in other cameras. Good size and relatively rugged.I would definitely buy again.
4,Fabulous camera! Can't beat the price!,"As a professional photographer, I wanted a small camera that I could just keep in my purse for those little moments between shoots with my pro equipment. I replaced my Casio EX-Z60 with this camera, and am MUCH happier. The LCD is wonderful, especially the auto dim that adjusts when it is too bright to view, the size and weight is fabulous and the overal image quality is quite impressive for the price! The only problems I have are that the shutter lags and I would not recomment for ""sports"" or ""action"" shots, and it's a little slow at start up/viewing of images. Other than that, you can't get a better deal for the price!"
3,Blurry pictures,I just bought this camera and love the size and features. The thing I don't like is the quality of the photos. They are blurry and out of focus. I have tried all of the different settings and the only thing that seems to help is to always have the flash on. My 5 year old Cannon that is a 2 MP took much clearer pictures with much less blur. I am going to hold onto the camera through Christmas to see what I can figure out but I may have to return. Too bad because everyhting else about the camera(including price) is great!
4,Pentax Optio M20 7MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom,"Excellent camera. I am giving it 4 stars only because the alkaline batteries are depleted too quickly. I am now using lithium AA's. They're supposed to last 7 times longer, it they are to be believed."
3,Died as soon as warranty was over,"I had this camera for one year. The shutter button fell off while my son was getting married. No more photos for me!When I got home I looked up the warranty. It ran out about 1 day after the camera broke. So I checked out the service centers that Pentax offered for repairs. When I contacted the one nearest me, they said the flat rate to fix the camera was almost exactly the same amount as I had paid to buy it new.Next time I will buy an extended warranty, or assume that under $100 digital cameras are also in the ""disposable camera"" category."
5,Tasha Tudor's Heirloom Crafts,Beautiful secondhand book about handcraft in perfect condition just as it said on Amazon. I can certainly recommend this seller.
2,:-\,"I'll admit, I didn't finish the book. But if the writing/editing is so sloppy that the main character's dog changes genders five times in three pages, I can't be bothered. What's that tell me the actual mystery part is going to be like, if the author can't even keep track of his pronouns on something that simple?"
5,Really Really Nice!,"This is a GREAT CD! Lovely backround seasonal music that won't intrude but will have you humming along. CLASSIC -I'm not religious, but this CD makes me want to find someone who has his other stuff and steal it!"
5,Inspiring,Very inspiring intrepretation of these classic hymns. I so enjoyed a song I heard on the radio and had to have the album
4,Nice but where are the extras?,"First, where is season 3-6? It has been a few years now and there is no mention of the remaining seasons. Season 2 is nicely done, containing all of your favorite episodes. The video quality is excellent for B&W. However, where are the extras?!? Would have been nice to have cast commentaries from Tony & Jerry as they look back on each episode. That is the only disappointment to these releases is that there are not enough extras."
5,Waiting to buy Season 3 !!!,"Our children 10 and 13 (and both of their parents!) love Leave it to Beaver seasons 1 and 2, and have worn them out. We are based in Asia, but love the good old American shows I grew up with circa 1960s.Where are Seasons 3, 4, and 5 ??? We promote these DVDs among our other English-speaking friends who would gladly buy them if someone would sell them!Waiting hopefully..........."
4,good quality,I was surprised at the picture quality of this DVD set when played on a bluray player with a high definition television. Of course the content itself is excellent. I never get tired of watching these shows.
5,Leave it to Beaver First &second season,"My family and I have been enjoying these quite well. The quality is good on these DVD's and the sound is excellent. Its great to be able to watch them @ your own convenience rather than having to plan your schedule to be able to watch ""The Beaver"". Hats off to you Amazon!!! I give these a five star rating!!!!"
5,It was perfect,"I liked this product because I am a leave it to beaver fan. I haven't used it yet, because it is a christmas present. It met my expectations very well."
4,Where is Season 3????,"My partner and I have just finished watching season 2 of Leave It To Beaver and just loved it! I jumped on to Amazon today to buy the next season and was shocked to see it is not available! I want to add my voice to the others here for it to be released as soon as possible. This has to be THE quintessential all-American family series of all time! What gives? Did the sales of season 1 and 2 not meet expectations? Those of us that love this show want to own ALL the episodes to watch and enjoy over and over again. I am an Aussie and never got to experience this show as a kid. Now that I have seen it, I can't get enough!"
2,What's going on?,"I depend on Amazon reviews for most of my purchases. I read the reviews and they seem to be mixed. A few people commented about the poor quality of the DVD, but others said it was excellent and clear. I figured that the few negative comments were just sour grapes so I took a chance and paid almost $40.00 (with shipping) for one season. Now I wish I hadn't. The picture quality is not what I expected from a new release.Either some of the DVD's are defective or some people have better eye sight than others.I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this season. Leave it to Beaver is the all-time best classic show, but I do want to warn you that you may not be pleased with the picture. Now I do wish I had waited to see if the quality is improved on down the road."
5,They switched networks after Series Two,"The show originally switched to a new network after the second series back in the 50's. That's why there's a huge delay between the second and third series releases today. It's due to present corporate ownership rights so there's another pile of red tape that has to be sifted through to get the rest of the LITB series out there. Universal/GE owns the first two but not the rest.I'm confident that the present owner (CBS?) will release them one of these days. If you make it, they will buy."
5,Loving it!,"This item arrived on time, actually before I expected it. Perfect condition and I've watch the whole set several times since I received it. Just knock the price down on the next ones and I'll be able to afford more. :P :) lol"
3,LITB S 2,"I don't know if I should be grateful for season 2 coming out or knock it for it's short comings. A little of both I guess .First, I'm so glad that this is finally out on DVD. It's about time. All episodes are here and uncut. Now for the bad. To echo other reviews there are no extras and I'm seeing a lot of grain. Watch these episodes and then watch I Love Lucy,Andy Griffith or Sgt. Bilco.These are everything that LITB should have been. Clear as a bell and lots of extras. Lucy and Bilco even predated LITB by 3-4 years. I'm deducting 1* for lack of extras and another for picture quality. Lets hope that season 3 is a huge improvement! I won't hold my breath."
4,Leave it to Beaver - The Complete Second Season,I purchased this product for my son and he says he is veryhappy with the quality of it. He is a Leave it to Beaver fan.
5,the stars at night are big and bright!,"I have 5 sets of these stickers on my 7 year old's ceiling and it is awesome! I turn the ceiling light on while he bathes every night and by the time he is tucked in to bed his ceiling is so incredible...it looks like he is sleeping outside. The tiny ones are the key to giving the ceiling depth and making it look real. It is a time consuming task (about 90 minutes per sheet) but the result is incredible! He no longer uses a night light because it ruins the affect, besides with more than 2000 of these on his ceiling (each set offers more than 400 stars) it honestly gives off a nice subtle glow. To save on shipping I recommend ordering a few sets at once."
3,Glow in the dark stars....,"Shipping time was good and the stars do glow in the dark. Only problem is the description in the write-up says ""small stars"". That's a relative term. I had no idea they're quite as small as they are - would have bought more sets if I had known. Description also says ""400 pieces"" - some of those pieces are dots so small they're hard to remove from the page and get on the wall. But they do glow in the dark."
4,"Great, but small","These stars were great except for one thing - half of the stars are miniscule. It's not the number of stars that is time consuming, it's the size and the effort it takes to remove them from the paper and place them onto your ceiling/wall. It's a very tedious job putting each of the tiny stars on your ceiling or wall. I really like the end effect, but I would recommend buying more than 1 package and using only the larger ones because putting 200 teeny-tiny stars up will drive you crazy. Good luck!"
4,glow in the dark stars,"I put them on my ceiling...they are bright. A little slow in the shipping area, but other than that, good transaction."
1,1 star because thats how many stars came in the package,the package of stars was tiny. My total came out to like 10.00 bucks. What a frickin rip off
4,A good place to start,Introduces the Goddess in her various guises. Goes through a summaried description of the stories of each lady and her role in the seasons.
4,Nice model of EVA-00.,"This is a really nice model. I like the complex movement that can be achieved by the Revoltech joints (by the way, this is my first Revoltech figure).I know what 6 inches look like, yet when I received the figure I thought it was ""small"". Nevertheless, it is a very well built, detailed model of the EVA-00. You can move the feet, knees, hips, torso, shoulders, elbows, wrists and head. You can also replace the hands with different ones to achieve different posses for your display.It is a cool little figure to add to your ""geek"" shelf or to be your desk companion at the office.Some of the joints are harder to move than others the first time. I suggest you are as careful as possible when breaking-them-out to avoid damaging them. This is NOT a toy :-) it is an action figure! a really good one in my opinion.I recommend it to Evangelion groupies, fans and followers."
1,EMT Basic Exam Practice 4th Edition,"This book was not what i was expecting it to be at all. the questions were good for studying, but did not relate to the exam"
5,NuNu meets his match!,Loved this and as always learned so much. So glad that Cesar could help these ladies to have a nice dog that they could both enjoy.
4,Prompt delivery!,"Good show! I love watching this show,I just wish he would show steps and pointers of how he trains them,so it would help us at home!"
1,Dog Whisperer,It was of no use for me as I had seen all of thaton Animal PlanetThought there would be some thing different.
1,Not enough Information 3,"We returned this item. We had already ordered the complete 1st and 2nd Seasons. This DVD was full of Highlights of the 1st Season. Had we known this we would have spared Amazon the shipping costs both ways. As far as Cesar Millan is concerned, he is amazing. I would recommend thisseries to anyone who dosen't want to order the complete series."
5,Great book,Very interesting and complete. Makes you want to visit and keep exploring. Well written. Holds you interest.
2,Not worth the money - spend more and get a better one.,This toaster seemed great at first but the inside heating element has stopped working after a few months and only half the bread gets toasted. Spend a little more money and get a more reliable toaster.
2,Different Clothes,"I ordered Izzy because I like the cute western outfit she's wearing in the picture and she was a gift for the daughter of a friend of mine in Austin, TX. Unfortunately the outfit she was delivered wearing is totally different and not AT ALL western. It's more Vegas or kind of trashy big city. I haven't opened it because it's a gift, but it looks durable and cute enough in the box. The box, though, came quite smashed up. I have to decide now whether to give it to her or go out and get something else."
4,Excellent magical items source for DM's and gamers alike,"Well, to start with you'd expect this book to be entirely stacked to the rafters with the utmost in specific magics from all corners of the AD&D gaming worlds. When in actual fact it is stacked to the rafters with the utmost in specific magics from all corners of the AD&D gaming worlds. There are some good, some not so good and some damn right evil pieces of equipment in here. Naturally it is a bit of a pain having to buy all 4 to get the full benefit, but imagine the fun with all those amulets, and armour types. To be honest it is not great. But it does list every magical item from the DM guide (1st edition) to Dragon magazine (about issue 200). It's really good, honest!"
4,Great DM Tool,The must have collection of magic items. Works great if you know what you need. Just have a piece of paper handy while browseing. You may find an amusing item and need to note the page number.
3,Somewhat Nice,"The only reason to get these books is if you have no imagination, or need to get magical items in your treasure quickly. The 4th volume is the most useful, as it has the index and tables for rolling the items randomly."
2,Did not work,"I put this in my daughters car and tried to install the radio ""sleeve"". It did not fit so I took the front piece off and just kept the two side pieces in place. That didn't work either. I ended up using the factory radio brackets on my JVC single DIN radio. The car I was installing in is a Hyundai Accent 2003. The product was shipped on time and all but just didn't work."
3,A little too shiny and moves on counter,"It is a great size and does hold 2 loaves of bread. I bought it to blend in with all my new stainless steel appliances but it is ALOT shinier than the brushed stainless. It also tends to move around alot when you flip the lid to take the bread out, a few rubber stoppers can solve this but for the price I thought they would have perfected the model. I would reccommend it but it is overpriced, I just couldn't find a good alternative to suit my needs."
4,Good Quality.,"Very nice, a little smaller than I thought it would be. However it actually can hold two full loaves of bread."
3,Smaller than I thought,"Nice product, even though I had the dimernsions, it just seems small. Still like it though."
1,"Attractive, but dysfunctional","I really liked the look of this soap dispenser (purchased through Amazon in Feb 2011), which I planned to use with dishwashing soap in the kitchen. The dispensesr looks good, but after a while the tip started to rust, the soap began to leak near the pump, leading to a messy countertop. I now find myself shopping for another..."
1,Cheap dispenser,Do not buy this dispenser unless you want a disposable product. It will crack on both side seams after about one year.
1,"Nice decoration, but.....","This dispenser was heavier than I expected, with a nice secure rubber base. Simple design, and no electrical glitches possible. I poured in the soap and pumped and nothing came out. I tried washing it and tried it again with soap thinned a bit by water. Still nothing. The cap and pump mechanisms by the way look cheap, less substantial than what you see in a $1.99 bottle of soap sold at the drugstore. It is barely worth the time to return a ten dollar item, but Amazon makes it easy, and they always stand behind their merchandise. (Unlike a certain other marketplace, E-Something, where you take your chances as a buyer.) I am exchanging this non-working item for aUmbra Touch Molded Soap Pump, Avocado. I received one of these in the same order and it actually pumped."
1,Double Trouble,"I purchased this soap dispenser in Nov (under my husband's acct, loved the long spout idea for new condo kitchen. Ordered a second (under my own acct) for dishwashing liquid). It would not pump! Spent hours trying to figure out why, but no luck. To make matters worse, a mixup in ordering resulted in my receiving a duplicate. Did that work? no!"
2,"Leaky, Over-rated","Looks and functionality are not everything. Yes, it pumps soap, but it leaks at the base of the pump. Over-rated."
1,Worthless piece of junk!,"Don't waste your money. The soap dispenser arrived and would not pump at all! I tried filling it with soap and also just plain water, but nothing would come through when I tried to pump it."
2,Nice looks but poor performance,"I got this for a counter top dish soap dispenser. The problem is that it refuses to pump the soap. It's like there is some blockage inside the pump that prevents all but a tiny dribble of soap to come out. I bought another type of pump from Walmart and when I transferred the soap, I tried pumping water. Same problem, no soap (water). I would send it back, but spending $5 shipping for a $10 item leaves me cold. Four stars for looks, no stars for performance."
2,Close only counts in horseshoes.,"We've owned this soap dispenser for about a year and filled it with dish detergent for our kitchen sink. At first it worked perfectly. Then vertical splintering started in the clear acrylic, slowly at first. The drips at the neck were easy enough to rinse off under running water, but the gradual decay of the clear acrylic ruined this dispenser. I tried to find another bottle to place the pump on. No luck. Unfortunately, I can't find anything better that includes what I like: long nozzle, non-shatter, non-slide, non-rust, clear. I don't want to purchase this as a replacement annually and will continue my search elsewhere."
1,Not Good,This soap dispenser looks good until you squirt the soap....and it squirts straight out and all over you. I'll be throwing it away. How disappointing to find this dispenser is so poorly designed.
1,Attractive and does the job but leaked the very first day.,"*Edit*I have had this for a few months and it just started erupting soap and leaking everywhere. Please don't buy this.I've had this product for about a week, it does a decent job at sitting on my counter pumping dish soap and looking well while doing it.However it has leaked ever since the first time I depressed the pump, not a lot but it obviously wasn't quality checked. I have a disposable Soft Soap dispenser (bought filled with soap for less than $3.00) made entirely of plastic that we have been reusing in our bathroom for about 2 years now that NEVER leaks so this is pretty disappointing when I actually paid for something.Mine leaks right where the metal spout is welded to the plastic pump. I might try taking it apart and melting that area with a lighter or something. Or I could just chuck this and buy another $3.00 ""disposable"" dispenser that is already filled with soap."
3,"Great little pump, but it sticks","Bought this last November and have been using it since. My only issue with it is that the pump sticks so I usually get only about half a pump of soap unless I first pull the plunger up while holding the base down. For me, this would be a 5 star product if it had a stronger spring. I haven't had any leakage yet."
3,Good for the first year,This dispenser worked great for about a year now when I come home the sink is full of soap.
2,OK,"I actually bought the clear version a while back. It looks ok, but it leaks and pumps too much soap, which is wasteful. Overall not very good. I've decided it's time to look for a replacement."
2,Progressive acrylic soap dispenser,"I ordered this from Amazon and received it in January. It has been leaking since May. It is now wasting soap and very messy and I am going to toss it and buy something different. It is unfortunate because I like the design, the rubber base that keeps it in place on the enamel sink rim, the clear acrylic container and the long handled spout. However, I believe the design of the long handled spout is what led to it's demise either in design, during manufacture, or just plain old regular use.I would not recommend this soap dispenser for that reason."
1,"Looks good, functionality lacking","This soap dispenser looks good, but that is it. Every time you pump it, the top stays down and does not come back up. So you have to manually pull the pump back up almost everytime you use it. I have yet to see it make the soap foam at all. It kind of comes out in a splurt. I have diluted the soap to different strengths, and this does not seem to help. The only good thing I can say is that it has a long spout on it, which comes in handy for putting soap in a pan. Other than that, I would not recommend this product."
4,Ugly but functional,I bought two of these soap dispensers based on other Amazon reviewers. I have had them for about 1 month and so far they have held up very well and work fine. They are stable and have a rugged look but they won't win any designer contest. I am keeping them both.
3,Looks great but arrived shattered!,I liked the appearance of the dispenser but didn't get a chance to use it. It was packed with several air bags but not secured to the packing so was totally broken on delivery.
1,Leaks!,"Had to return the first soap dispenser, because it leaked from the bottom. Amazon replaced it. The second soap dispenser also leaked.They look nice, but not worth the trouble."
1,At First Great But Easily Cracks,"I purchased maybe ten of these over a year ago. Since then all have developed serious cracks, and some have begun leaking. Ultimately this unit does not work for someone who has a heavy hand. The Oxo dispenser, for five dollars more, is very sold, very attractive and lasts.OXO Good Grips Big Button Soap or Lotion Dispenser, Stainless/BlackUpdate: A year after the above review, all but two of the Progressive dispensers have cracked to the point of leaking and the others are nearly there. The OXO dispenser has replaced all of them, and there are still no problems with it."
2,"Great, BUT ...","Great size, great spout. But 6 months after purchase, developed a huge crack and became unusable. It was not dropped, tipped or jarred, so how the crack developed is a mystery. At least it's recyclable, but I'll spend alittle more to replace."
3,second chance,"bought this soap dispenser about six months ago for my kitchen sink.very attractive and functional.however the base cracked mysteriously on its own.i really miss it so im going to order it again.if the next one cracks,the next review will not be so nice."
3,Good dispenser as long as you never drop it,"Bought this on amazon because of the great ratings, it worked well. I really didn't have any problems with it, although soap did get caked up on the underside of the spout and at the tip, but the clear plastic looked great when I had blue soap in it. Knocked it over and it fell about 5 inches into my sink and cracked completely up the side resulting in soap leaking out constantly. Thought it was completely my fault for knocking it over and actually found another one in Home Goods for the same price. I replaced it, yet again with slippery, soapy hands, it fell into the sink only to crack again and render itself useless. I plan on throwing it out and buying a totally different soap dispenser. The plastic just seems a little too sensitive for my liking."
1,Defective Product,This is the third time I tried to reorder a new Progressive International Acrylic Soap Dispenser. I have used this type of dispenser for about 7 years and really liked it. I tried to reorder -- the first one the pump would not work and I returned it and re-reordered. That one did not work and I just through it away. I will not order another.
5,Good Product,"I bought 3 of this soap dispenser, they are efficient, work well no drippings, no mess. I am using them in the kitchen and also gave one to my daughter. She really likes it. I would highly recommend!"
1,Linda,"This is my second purchase. Should have know. Both of the bottles acquired a crack from top to bottom, allowing soap to leak out. Never again. This is obviously an inferior product. I really like the pump spout being long. I will save that, 2 now, and see if it works on any other items. Bad product."
2,"Leaks, and spout is too long","After only filling it once, already the spout is leaking at the neck (not the part next to the bottle, but the fully-connected top part). I don't know why it's so difficult to find a decent soap bottle, and I've been looking for a while but unfortunately this one was a bust.Even when it was working (the first day or two), the spout was so long that it was difficult to figure out where to place your hands. Anyway, not recommended at all. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because it's not terribly expensive, and it's kind of nice-looking, but yeah, not functional at all."
4,Very convenient,"I have found that I really like this soap dispenser. It doesn't move around because of the rubber around the bottom so you can pump without having to hold onto it. With the long spout you can pump right into the sink, sponge or pot without having to pick up the bottle of soap and squeeze it in. I recommend it."
2,started leaking after about 1 year,"This soap pump initially worked great, but for some reason the bottom started leaking after we had it about a year. I'm not sure why, but the soap seems to be coming out of the seam near the black ring at the bottom. Very weird."
1,Never worked,Didn't pump out of the box. Nothing I tried made a difference. Returned it today and will try one more time with this product.
1,disappointed and returned,"I found this soap dispenser with a product search for foaming soap dispensers and, indeed, it has the characteristic internal mechanism but it does not create a foam. Instead a normal push dispenses an excess of liquid soap that overflows even my husband's large hand and creates a mess on the counter. I returned it."
2,Unexpected Problems,"1.) Needs 2 hands! Spout is too long to dispense soap into palm of hand while pushing top down with thumb of same hand (as I now realize you do w/ most dispensers).2.) Soap in long spout leaks out slowly over time (into my sink, or onto counter, etc.).I'd look elsewhere."
5,functional,The soap dispenser is by far the best I have used over the years. I replaced my battery driven dispenser with this one because it have an immediate output and a variable amount of soap dispensed. The long snoot goes over the sink for minimum cleanup.
1,Waste of money,"This dispenser is a waste of money. First you waste money on purchasing the dispenser, then you waste money on all the dish soap that leaks out. It looks nice on your sink until the soap continues to leak out the bottom and makes a huge mess."
3,"ordered two, returned and the third one so far OK","I had an old one that stopped working. Found it in Amazon, ordered two of them. One was getting stuck when pushing down to dispense the soap, and the second one has a leak beneath the black section of the dispenses (when pressing down). I returned both, one for a refund and the other for a replacement. Received the replacement in a couple of days and so far it is working fine. I received 2 defective ones and the third one seems to be working properly."
1,This Soap Dispenser leaks soap from the bottom.,"Don't buy this soap dispenser. I bought it and it looked great... but I always had to wipe up drying soap from the counter. I thought maybe the spout is dripping but the soap was always at the base. I cleaned it up, set it down and more soap at the base. It leaks soap. Don't buy it."
4,"Works fine, don't like the condensation","Functions well and I like the long spout. I can't explain why, but condensation is always present near the top of the bottle, making it less attractive.Correction: over time, the condensation hasn't happened much. Must be a weather thing."
2,doesn't last long,"I have had such issues with soap dispensers - on some the pump doesn't work, or they leak, or rust. I found this one and it worked well - so well I bought another for our cottage. Now, within months of normal use, both of them have cracks in the container starting from the screw threads down. Good grief. I am very disappointed as I thought I had finally found a dish soap dispenser that worked. I am admitting defeat and will just use the bottle the soap comes in from now on."
1,1 star because it wont let me leave 0 stars,"This thing is garbage, lasted just long enough that I could not return it. The sides crack and soap leaks out, I could fix this but the plunger device also spews soap all over the sides.Do not buy, spend a few extra bucks and get something better. It is too bad too because the big plunger head and long nozzle are awesome in ergonomics, but terrible in design apparently. Either it has no seals or it is so cheap it just breaks.I had read some other reviews that said this happen so I tried to be gentle with it, it did not work and finally I got so fed up with constantly refilling and cleaning the sides I threw it out. Total waste of money."
4,Great bathroom soap dispenser,I've had this dispenser in the bathroom for a couple of weeks and so far it hasn't cracked or broken like other reviewers said happened to them. The only bad thing that i've noticed is it does tend to leak out of the nozzle a little bit sometimes but i think this depends on what kind of liquid soap you use in this dispenser. Overall it's not bad for the price and the long nozzle is great.
1,Broken on delivery,"I would have thought a simple soap dispenser would be a pretty easy purchase. But, this thing never worked. I don't know how a company can sell something so horribly broken.I filled it up with soap and tried to test it. After 10 minutes of trying to ""fill"" the tube that led up to the top, I gave up. There isn't anything wrong with it as far as I can tell. It simply has a flawed design and I am guessing they hope to just sell it to people that don't read reviews.At $11, it's almost worthless to try to send it back. (It will cost me a few dollars in postage to say nothing of the time wasted finding another box, etc.)Don't buy this... it is total crap."
3,Defective Plunger,"Received as promised however when I filled it with soap it would not plunge. I practically had to put all my weight on the plunger just to get it to move a little. I washed it out really good with water then filled it with only water and had the same issue. For some reason it plunges fine when empty but clogs or will not plunge when filled with a liquid substance. Sent request for refund and received reply that refund will be issued when the product is returned. Since I have read other positive feedback I am willing to take a chance that I just received one of the defective items and will order again. Had one years ago that worked very well so I am wanting another one to make it easy for dispensing dish soap while washing dishes. I don't really care about looks, I am more interested in function. Hope the next one works better. I will post an update once I receive the refund and another dispenser."
1,Rusty spout,"I am not happy with this purchase at all. I bought this dispenser because I thought it would be more attractive on my counter-top instead of a bottle of dishwashing liquid, plus more convenient to use since I would not have to pick it up when I need to wash a dish by hand. Unfortunately, the metal tip of the spout started rusting within a week of my using it and it just kept getting worse and is very unattractive! I am currently looking for a replacement dispenser that will not do the same thing. Buyer beware!"
1,Should've listened to the newest reviews - broken in less than a month!,"I really liked this pump when it worked the first week. I received this May 18 and it's now June 10; I'm once again in search for a new dispenser. I should've listened to all the latest reviews for this product but I wanted to take a chance. It used to be a great item according to some of the reviews on here so I thought perhaps the company would've listened and by now would've changed back to their old, reliable dispensers that they used to sell. Unfortunately this isn't the case. It's just another cheap acrylic that looks good and works fine until 2 weeks into it you're realizing the pump no longer works and refuses to spring back up on its own. Needless to say, I will be returning this (I ordered this via prime and there's no shipping cost to return - thank goodness!) Do yourself a favor and look for another dispenser because this isn't it, unless you like to throw money away and get a new one every 2 weeks."
2,Plunger sticks.,"I bought two of these based on their good looks, long spouts, and great reviews.Unfortunately, I've found that the plunger on each sticks and needs to be pulledback up after each squirt. Really annoying."
2,It broke after one and half month,"This dispenser worked well at the beginning, five star!!! However, the bottle cracked for no reason and the soap leaked all over the kitchen counter after our one-month vacation. Since it just passed the refund/return deadline, we were not able to return it. Disappointing in the end, and we will not buy this product anymore."
4,"Nice pump, but drips (+ double listing)","This pump works very well for me next to the kitchen sink to supply dish soap. It dripped from the end after the first few uses; a trick is to depress the pump, then hold your finger over the end while letting it move back up. I did this a few times to eliminate any air in the intake. Now the drip is mostly gone ... but I still wake up to the occasional few drops of soap in the sink.I found out after ordering that the same product is available in another Amazon listing (Progressive International Acrylic Soap Dispenser). Same product, less money (with shipping) -- especially if you belong to Amazon Prime."
1,Leaks at the seams,Purchased in October 2011 and by March 2012 it was leaking at the seams. NOT worth the money to last barely 5 months. Not eligible for return or I definitely would try to get my money back.
5,Very pleased!,Great dispenser! Looks sexy on the kitchen counter. No leaks so far and long pump works great for dispensing dish soap.
5,True to reviews!,I bought this item because of its rave reviews. And here I am writing another. Its everything it's cracked up (reviewed) to be. Great purchase!
3,"Good idea, but bad construction","I got two of these. One to put by the kitchen sink, another to a basement bathroom. Unfortunately, the spout fell out a few months after I purchased it. I think the spout is a little too long as well and sometimes it shoots out the dishwasher detergent/soap if you press hard enough. The spout have fallen out multiple times. It is a nice, clean looking dispenser, but the spout is not a great design on it."
2,Bad design,"This soap pump is badly designed. The soap keeps dripping below where the spout attaches to the cap, accumulates there, dries up, and creates a mess. Although it is a fairly low-priced item (a little over $ 10), if it does not work well, it is about $ 10 down the drain!"
1,Leaking base,The soap dispenser I received seems to have a faulty seal from the base of the product to the plastic container and is now leaking the soap contained inside.
2,Poor quality soap dispenser.,"Have 2 of these, pump action is excellent, butthe plastic cracked on both of them. Would notrecommend unless you keep out of sun."
2,not great,This isn't a great soap dispenser. The long spout easily comes loose. I had to glue it back in place after a few weeks.
2,Love the design....BUT,"This is the second of this nicely designed dispenser that I have owned. The first fell into my sink and the body cracked so soap would continuously leak from the crack. So Sad. I liked the design with the narrow profile that fit perfectly on the corner of my sink and the long spout that squirt way into the sink that I ordered another. Well, guess what? The second one fell into the sink and the body was cracked again!! I swear I am not a klutz. Nor am I rough on things! This is just made of a seriously brittle material. I could see if I forcefully threw it onto concrete it should break, but, for pete's sake, it fell 6 inches into my sink? I am making a plea to the manufacturers: Use a more durable plastic for the body of this dispenser and you would have a real winner. As it stands, not so much."
1,I broke it?,"I don't think I understood what acrylic soap meant, because I've tried filling this with both our dish soap and hand soap and it didn't work for either."
4,looks good - great weighted bottom,It is perfect for our needs. We have it by our kitchen sink - the long nozzle is great. Easy to fill.
1,Did not work at all,Purchased this dispenser - when it arrived it did not work at all; the replacement for the defective product also did not work. Obviously poor workmanship. Thank goodness for Amazon's generous return/refund policy
5,Very functional and clean looking,This is a very nice dispenser for the kitchen. I can pump dishwashing liquid into the sink w/o picking up the dispenser and it is also nice when you have messy hands and don't want to touch the sides. Holds a lot of product and clear so you can see when it is time to refill. Nice rubber ring on the bottom too so it doesn't slide around. Very good product and I would highly recommend purchasing it.
1,Don't waste your money,"I wish I had not bought this. You need two hands to get the soap out, the dispenser is too long for one hand. The worst part is that it leaks soap all the time. I get up in the morning and soap is all over my sink, I come home from work and soap is all over my sink. So if you are looking for a soap dispenser that leaks liquid soap all over buy this!"
1,Progressive International Soap Dispenser,The design on this cap is not a good one. It is made of plastic with a steel rod coming out the hole in the top. It came with the plastic housing broken around the steel pipe. I tried to glue it back but it is not holding. It would be much better if the whole cap was made of steel.I do however like the design shape and the fact that it is clear.
2,Plastic keeps splitting/cracking,"I wanted to love this, and I do as long as it lasts, but after a couple months, the plastic under the cap begins to start to split and keeps splitting until the bottle starts to leak. It hasn't been dropped or manhandled in any way, but this is the 3rd one I've had and they all break. It looks nice on the back of the sink but I'll have to buy an alternative."
1,No Foam,"This is my second attempt to buy a foaming soap dispenser. I don't usually have bad luck when I buy things online. The first one worked great but the bottom leaked and all the soap ran out. This one doesn't make foam at all. I'm giving this one star because it does work as a liquid soap dispenser, and I may as well keep it till I find a foaming soap dispenser, but I'm angry that I was lied to, and I wasted my money. I've never given a seller a bad rating before. By the time I package it and pay for shipping, it won't be worth it to get my money back. I'm glad to see the price has come down. I paid eleven dollars for mine, but it's not worth more than three or four bucks."
4,Best I've found,"It's been a chore finding a decent soap dispenser for the kitchen. Tried out several, and they all seem to suffer from some type of problem, be it a reluctant pump mechanism, poor ergonomics, leaks or, in the case of the electronic ones, faulty electronics.This one seems to be the best of the bunch. While it is not as attractive as the stainless ones, it's not bad looking at all. It's rimmed in black with a chrome nozzle, so it blends in well. Easy to fill and very much appreciate having a longer nozzle - it's handy when you want to squirt soap right into the sink without having to pick up the dispenser. The non-skid base is also a nice touch, and works well.I'm not sure of the long-term durability, but so far it works well. Given that it's plastic it probably would not survive a drop. But, good value for the price."
2,a bit messy,"It's just the right size that I wanted. It works great, but the pump always leaks soap out of the top and then it is messy. You are constantly wiping it. If it didn't leak, it would be great."
2,Works good then breaks too soon,"I was thrilled with this when I got it. It was great. About 6 months later, the spout developed a leak which I patched but then the bottom started to leak too. Also, if you're not careful the spout will fall out. It can be put back in but it's a pain and the quality is not great."
4,A refreshing look at a familiar story,"I often have trouble getting through some Christian books as they seem to be very dry. This book was a refreshing change and one which I would recommend to anyone who has an interest in the prophets.Jeff Lucas skillfully weaves a story that keeps you spell bound as you follow in the steps of this important biblical figure. He builds a picture of the man in his time, and in the process reveals some fascinating facts. This book has formed the basis for a bible study which amazed everyone with its insight and clarity.This has been a great awakening for me, and left me thirsty for more on this subject."
1,Ugh... disgusting...,"This sounds nothing like SOAD, and is probably disgraces the band more than promotes it. I listened to 3 seconds of it, and i literally puked. The guy in this CD sounds like a high version of a retarded Michael Jackson. ""Schhuuuuggggarrrrr...""I threw this album into a bonfire then ran over it with concrete so it would not haunt me."
1,Sad,"This is one of the worse tributes to a band I have ever heard. Plus System of a Down had only put out 2 CDs when this came out and they have only been around about around 5 years... I love System of a Down but I don't feel that right now while there in there prime they disserve a tribute album plus they didn't even get the bands name right on the CD.. ""Tribute to a System of a Down"" its not a System of a Down, it's System of a Down."
3,What a tribute album is...,"i'm not writing this to review the cd, as much as review the reviews. i'm not entirely sure that these people understand what a 'tribute album' is. By definition, it's an album that's a tribute to another band. This means that it is *not* going to be a remix cd, since it's very difficult to do a tribute to your own band. It is *also* not ""a couple of their songs and your own songs that were SOAD styled,"" this would be a CD with some cover songs on it, which is also not a tribute cd. So, in my opinion, if you are ignorant enough to buy a CD without even undertanding what it is, you deserve a CD one hundred times worse than whatever it is you get."
1,no stars for this one!!!!!!!!,What were they thinking? Don't be fooled by everything that says System of a down. The loosers that made this must really hate system or something. People like this should keep tributes like these to themselves. System deserves better than that.
2,Don't Ever Get Stuck In The Sky...,"Well, it looks (and sounds) as if some musicians who love System just as much as I do got together and decided to create a tribute to them. System Of A Down definitely deserves a tribute album; hell, ... has a tribute album, and they pretty much suck. Anyway, this CD is alright, the vocals could be better though, I guess no one can match Serj's trademarked screams and roars, but musically the songs are pretty true to the originals. It would have been neat to see some well-known groups make a tribute album to SOAD, but for now, we'll have to settle for this. In closing, I'd reccommend this album to hardcore fans who are interested in hearing the album, but otherwise, don't waste your time."
1,listen to this if you've run out of ipecac & you're poisoned,... The weak mothers who made it didn't even have the guts to put their names on the CD but attribute it to various artists when it's not. The singer does a [bad] Serj imitation throughout. The guitar playing is not a new interpretation. It's just wrong. The only way that this album succeeded for me is in making me realize the unique brilliance of the original
1,. . .,"As response to the other reviews. . . It's all true. This is HORRIBLE. I wouldn't even recommend purchasing it if you were curious. If you are curious listen to the samples, that's all you need to hear how horrible this is..."
2,I don't like it,"I don't really like it. I think they would be better just singing their own songs, cuz they're not THAT bad. Just bad in comparison to system of a down. That's kinda confusing, but if you get it, yeah, its true. So, i dunno. My advice to them is write your own songs, and see how it goes. My advice to you is skip this, and buy an actual system of a down cd"
5,I never go to work without it!,"I work in Logisics & it's really tough on watches. The excess bands would always get hung up on something. Also the watch faces would get all scratched up from stuff. No problem for this baby! Machine washable(preferably cold, no dryer). Adjustable to any wrist & any wristwatch(all velcro). Only draw back is it takes two hands to check the time(not an issue for me though), so if you cannot spare the opposite hand when you need the time, it's not for you. Otherwise, you should not regret the purchase!"
5,best song ever!!!,This song is awesome!! he has a supperrrr great voice! i listen to the song hero like 24/7 and still dont get sick of it! I LOVE IT!! i so reccomend you buy it!!! See Spiderman!!
4,nice product,the DVD is very educationnal & we liked the live and animated characters mixed together. unfortunately I haven't played it often enough for my kids to really benefot from it
3,delivered on time,"the pillot seems to be of good quality, and fits the needs nicely. My wife uses it regularly so I guess she likes it"
3,Fatal Photographer,"This was an interesting book although I am confused on how Linda Sobek died. It is a shame that this woman left on a job assignment with a man who was supposed to be a professional and yet he was a nut. It makes you wonder about how you too could be a victim if you let a cable, tv repairman, telephone repairman, etc. (simply because they are also doing a job and should be trusted)come into your home. Rathbun should have gotten death. To be able to live his life even though it is behind bars is too good for such a piece of garbage, and shame on his brother for trying to hide the truth just to protect his brother (who I think he knew all along was capable of killing Linda)."
3,an ordinary book about linear algebra,this is an elementry book about linear algebra and a reviewer who receive a first coarse in linear algebra will find it an excellent book but it is an elementry book!
3,Super Reader,"Irish chop chop.A bit of history for the young Cormac, as he gets to do the warrior thing without running into too much in the way of magic.Large collections of Irish warriors with booze can get nasty.So, at the end :""'Art's son of Connacht is dead, Captain.''Aye. So too is Othna's son of Ulster. I never saw either of them, but have great feeling for them both. So too is Calba's son of Athaircthech dead, off a fever in the bloom of manhood. My son.''Sadness seems to rule the world, Captain, not kings and not justice.''Aye, philosopher. An it's a name ye'll be needing in Alba, it's mac Calba ye be welcome to call yourself.'"""
1,scammed by the publisher,"Be aware that this is NOT written by Robert E. Howard but is a take off of the character created by Howard. If you are looking for authentic Howard, this is not it. This doesn't mean that it is a bad or good book...it just isn't written by Howard.mh"
5,Music for meditation,"A friend at work lent me this CD - and immediately I needed to own this. Yes, this CD is only piano - and it's only hymns. I play this at work when I need to take the stress out of my day. I play the second CD of this (that I own) at home when I'm doing Bible Study, or just want to meditate.This is one of those CD's that have you singing along with the hymns - and because he plays them so many different ways, you can sing all the verses, if you so choose."
4,piano noodling,"I bought this gift for my husband for his birthday. He's a big Chris Rice fan and was looking for some music to noodle around with on the piano. The music isn't terribly difficult (which can be nice because you don't always want to have to practice to be able to play a song, so it's nice for relaxed playing). I personally wish it came with words, but then again the CD it's from doesn't have words. I just pull out a hymnal while he plays. For people more formally taught for piano, my husband commented that some of the writing can be awkward - guessing that it's been a while since Chris Rice has had formal training with the piano - as there are some less traditional parts (in terms of music arrangement and not that the hymn is ""modernized""). Just an FYI if it matters to anyone. Over all, my husband likes the book and is glad to have some music to noodle with."
5,Very nice arrangements,"I consider myself an intermediate to advanced-intermediate player and can play most of these arrangements. Some will take some practice, but it's easy enough to enjoy learning and hard enough to keep things interesting. I plan to look for more arrangements by Chris Rice."
3,Good Product,"Good Product - Bad Shipping (Took 2 times to order because said ""was returned to shipper, because didn't understand address"" - said would resend for 2 day shipping but never came. Had to reorder the product over again. Didn't understand the problem because this was the same address Amazon always ships to :-("
2,No Singing,I love Chris Rice but was severly disappointed with this purchase. It has no singing at all. That's right. None! And the worst part? No where on the CD jacket do you find any hint that its all piano. Very deceptive.
4,Simple yet beautiful,This a great buy for either the casual piano player who desires to play some great hymns or even for a church organist during communion. The arrangements are easy enough to produce on short notice yet still arranged in a beautiful and subtle manner. Definitely recommended.
4,A GREAT WAY TO INTRODUCE THE CLASSICS...,"Just like some other reviewer, I too was a kid when this album came out. I believe it was the first of a series of albums based on the same concept: big medleys where parts of classical music is sewed together with some kind of disco beat.Yeah, it sounds awful... almost a sin.But those who already love classical music are not the main target here. I was a kid then and knew nothing of classical music. And yet, these medleys really hooked me to the classics.It was only after that album that I started to think ""wow, these guys [Beethoven, Bach, Rachmaninoff and others] really wrote wonderful music... let me hear more of them"".Today, records like this sound horrible to me. But they had their function. In fact, for me, that's the only way to look at them: a very good source of introduction to classical music."
5,Where it all may begin...,"Americans and European people are often born and raised listening from their very tender age to the work of the great composers. This is not the case of South American people. Here we don't have any musical tradition of our own and, though most of us feel descendants of Western musical heritage, music has never been an item of interest on the educational programmes of our local governments. You Americans and first-worlders can't simply imagine how important a work such as Hooked on Classics can be for our nations! With its blend of rhythms and styles it has been a common point of departure for lots and lots of people, including me of course, in the rich paths of classical music. Definitely, the last 20 years have not been the same for us now that HOC is around."
1,Seizure-inducing Garbage,"What an offensive violation of classical music. Heard snippets today for the first time, unwillingly, since it was at my place of work. I was driven out of the room repeatedly - not only by the offensive drum machine beat but because the idea of hijacking and mutilatiing classical music was so incomprehensible to me. Would like to affix minus stars and fine the so-called composers for this egregious violation."
4,Great for the car!,"The classical music purist might frown at this, but I think they have done a pretty good job modulating a modern beat and rhythm to classical music. I like it.I have the old LP of this CD, and sorry to say the CD sounds terrible. I still gave it 4 stars, because who cares about sound quality these days, right ? Dont get me wrong, its not broken, but if you think MP3 sounds freakin' awesome you wont mind it."
5,Whether you like classical music or not...,"... you will love the rythym and beat and feel of this music! It is the best music to clean house by! I know, sounds silly, but most of it has such a good back beat, and you will hear many songs you probably recognize, from the Lone Ranger Theme song, to Flight of the Bumblebee, to Lullabye, and the music is just the best orchestration ever."
3,"Too much death to be ""Perfect for the whole family""","I'm far from a prude but there's very little here in depth about any of the many penguin species covered, and far too much death. It's dificult to go 5 minutes without seeing a penguin faceplant into the side of a cliff, get swung around from the jaws of a seal or get picked apart by sea birds. The camera lingered a bit too long on the frozen baby penguin graveyard at the end of the film. Yes, death is a perfectly natural part of life, and I'm perfectly okay with it, but this documentary's billing on the back of the jacket as ""Perfect for the whole family"" should be taken with a grain of salt. All that I'm saying is that I wouldn't show this to my four year old neice, and I almost sent it to her for Christmas this year, but I had the good sense to screen it."
4,A worthy work,"This a very interesting look at the psychological make up of ""the Underground Man"". It is a wonderful story and is a really good introduction to Dostoyevsky. This book is a great lead into some of Dostoyevsky's other novels, particularly Crime and Punishment."
5,Veracious analysis of the outcast,"A truly ingratiating book. The book may have a lugubrious setting, but the insight into a human mind and the social frustrations of an introvert are a wonder to behold. I personally found personal relavance in NFU."
3,Psychologically Compelling,"Dostoevsky should have been a psychologist. The author sees very penetratingly into the heart of human emotions. Any ""outsider"" should read this book. The major fault is that the main character is not so much misunderstood as a jackass. The reader will have a hard time relating to him -- I was left with the feeling that his misery was of his own creation and that he was so unpleasant as to deserve his misfortune. Even so, this is a must-read for all those interested in existential literature."
5,Loved this Story,I really enjoyed Zealk and the Humans. I just listened to the CD. The narrator did a great job making all the characters come to life with different voices. The story is really sweet.
4,Comments from Pastor John F. MacArthur,The most important category of truth is that which relates to the nature of God. One's view of God is the single greatest central element in spiritual experience. Nothing is more important than seeking to know him. Dick Mayhue surely understands that and charts a course that will lead the reader to a true understanding of God which will dramatically change your life.
4,Page-turner indeed!,"I could not put this book down! I respect this brother for putting his heart and soul on the line. His feelings are sincere and honest to a fault. I am not used to a man showing his vulnerability. I was told that to be in love means to be vulnerable at times.I can say that I felt an array of emotions while reading Cooper's semi-autobiographical novel. It was like being on an emotional roller coaster. There were times when I felt a love/hate emotions simultaneously for each particular character. This novel is not shallow. It has meaning and depth. The more you put into this novel the more you will get out of it.In my opinion, Mr. Cooper wants healing and the only way to find healing is to do some soul searching. I pray that he finds healing and direction.Reviewer: VE"
5,A Heart-Wrenching Tale,"As I read Six Days in January, I asked myself over and over again, why have I never been loved the way William loved Andrea.Unlike some of the reviewers I've read here, I don't hate Andrea. Many sisters don't know how to act when they finally run into a guy who treats them right. Who REALLY loves them right. I didn't hate her, I just wanted to be her. Me? I wouldn't run away.I met Mr. Cooper when I was in New York last week, and although I had no intention of buying his book, he convinced me. I'm so glad he did."
4,a book to read,"The book was pretty good. I think the author did a good job, considering this is his first book. I continued to read in the hopes that William would realize that Andrea was playing him. It is interesting to me that a man would go through some of the very same things that women go through. I was impressed by the love William felt for Andrea. It shows that men do bring old baggage into relationships. I was very impressed with Mr. Cooper's novel and would recommend it to anyone."
5,"A Sleeper ""Book Of The Year""...","When this book was passed to me by a colleague as a ""must read"", the title captured me. I thought ""what could happen in six days?"" A lot of deep soul searching, that's what. It takes a lot of courage for a man to admit there's something wrong. William McCall did so in fine form. Some of the powerfully descriptive scenes of love really touch you, so you better have a Kleenex nearby. I wish I could find a man so tender.The part I found amusing was when his grandmother almost caught his ""practice strip-tease."" When he did it for real, I panted as I did when reading his love scenes. Men aren't supposed to write like that!!!Typos notwithstanding, this is a brilliant book for a first time author whose potential is sky rocketing. Keep up the good work, Mr. Cooper."
4,Great Job,"I won this book through Ze'Divas Website. I haven't even heard of the book until, she informed me that I won. I was a little skeptical of this book at first. But once I began to read it, it was hard to put down. I loved the story and didn't want it to end. I felt bad for William and hated Andrea. This was a good book for an author who is just starting out. Keep up the good work Mr. Cooper."
4,What this woman is looking for!,"Reading ""Six Days In January"", was a refreshing insight to a sensitive mans compassionate heart on love. It was the first time I identified with a male character on the heartaches of love. It was good to see that there are men out there willing to go the extra distance for the women they love.Fredrick Cooper renewed my faith in a ""Black Man's"" ability to follow his heart. I cannot wait until the next time!"
5,Fred deserves the #1 spot for best seller!,"Talk about drama, William McCall had some issue's. Not just with Andrea and Della, but with himself. Having the privilege to read the novel before printing, anticipation ruled my life. I read the finished masterpiece as soon as the delivery man handed it to me.I recommended this novel to all my family and friends. Fred we want more! Hurry up with the next one.Every woman and man needs to read this book. You just might find yourself in one of the characters shoes. This novel is an eye opener for reality. Yet, it captivates you and literally conquers your soul. When people ask me what is it about, I just hand them the novel and tell them to see for themselves. When I get the book back, their reaction tells it all.I never thought I would rub it in but, Fred I told you this would be a seller. Keep on being real and your fortune will come."
1,Garage Time Park-N-Spot,"Purchased this item to help my 18 year old daughter position the car close to the garage door without bumping it. Less than 1 month after using this product it self-destructed. It was only used once a day, 5-days a week. The actual bumper on this product is hollow, but it is filled with a ground-up or pulverized rubber. Shortly after using the product (10-times or so) the hollow bumpers burst and the ground rubber filling proceeded to make a mess on the driveway, as well as being tracked into the garage. I recommend looking elsewhere for a similar product that is solid in construction and won't easily break apart."
1,SEIZE THE DAY RATHER THAN WASTING YOUR TIME.,"I have no idea what makes a movie like this popular, but hats off to whoever does. I found it very long, dull, and pointless. If I wanted to see a movie where a guy leaves home, gets ditched by girls and drinks a lot, I would spend 2 hours looking in the mirror and save myself 3 dollars for the rental."
1,Almost as fun as a root canal in slow-mo,"If you want to experience this movie, go to a deserted town on a cold drizzly day, sit by the train tracks, and watch the grass grow. No, you can't bring your I Pod. Sit there for 114 minutes and by then you will have already experienced all the joy and charm this movie holds in store for you."
1,Worst German movie we ever watched - not recommended for mainstream viewers,"It could make for an interesting character study, but if you are someone who usually likes mainstream movies, this one is not for you. It's slow and boring to the rest of us. We've only seen one other German movie that was possibly worse and I can't remember the title: something about chickens in Las Vegas (?). If anyone knows which one I am talking about, please comment! Thanks :-)"
1,Worst movie ever!!,This is the worst movie I have ever suffered through. Don't waste your time or money! I regret buying it.
3,Not really for German learners,"If you are purchasing the movie strictly to increase your German vocabulary, this may not be the best choice for you. The entire flick proceeds with minimal dialogue, and the last part of the film is mostly in English - with Schultze stumbling to make himself understood. If you approach it as a commentary on life and retirement, and are willing to augment the missing details with your imagination, you will probably like the production."
2,Like watching molases run,"I love foreign films, but Schultze is just boring. It has it's nice moments, but there's not a lot there. If you want a ""German out of place in America"" movie, try ""Bahgdad Cafe."""
2,Not what I expected,"Based on the trailer and the other reviews, I expected something with warmth and humor. However, episodes of warmth and humor are VERY widely spaced apart in this film. There are a few moments where I felt empathy for Schultze, and a few moments where I laughed, but in the end, it didn't really deliver the goods. The pace is also painfully slow. I wanted to tap the director on the shoulder and say, ""Alright, I get it. He's painfully lonely and has lived an unfulfilling life. Now move it along please!"""
1,Like spending two hours watching paint dry,"This movie has gotten many favorable reviews, but unless you are really into art house films, definitely stay away from it. The pace is extraordinarily slow, seeing it is like watching paint dry. The theme seems to be: life is dull, and then you die. We follow Schultze from his work as a miner, then retirement in Germany, finally on his trip to the American Delta region. All of it is painfully boring. When he gets to America, things are supposed to get better, but I really didn't notice much difference. We don't even get to see much of him playing his accordion. It's billed as a comedy, but is even more depressing than Jack Nicholson's About Schmidt, which had a similar theme."
5,Schultze Gets the Blues,"Schultze Gets the Blues makes its eloquent statements on personal freedom and the importance of music in our lives with an almost sleight of hand level of subtlety. A single Cajun riff found accidentally on the radio sets Schultze free. Freedom is not easily achieved, but Schultze is shown doing the hard work and making adjustments. He travels to the USA to appear in a Cajun festival, but quickly departs, looking for a truer vein of freedom. The film is beautifully made and often funny. Schultze makes his way often based upon his generous humanity. In these scenes, he summons powers that we didn't know he had. Many scenes simply display the kindness and hospitality. A wonderful, human film."
4,Quality film,"It is a good, quality, simple foreign film that prompts one to think about their quality of life and what one wants out of life. I appreciated the culture shock view of the writers of the film and it was expressed well cinematically. The character ""Schultze warms your heart."
4,A fun and exciting ride through the old west.,"A fun and exciting ride through the old west. Nobility combines the flavor of the west with story elements that are colorful and compelling. The author paints a vivid picture of the western timeframe, yet the story features interaction between characters that could happen in any era.As Clay Cole is an innocent man being chased, stories such as Les Miserables or The Fugitive come to mind. Plenty of action woven with life lessons as Cole encounters a widow and her two children--Nobility really mixes the elements well, and it's an entertaining trip definately worth taking."
1,not such a miracle,"A good little movie has been rendered qiute unwatchable in this release. The quality of this DVD (video portion) is unspeakable. Keep your money in your pocket until it is released after improvement, or by another label."
2,Ariel Shoes,"The decorations fell apart within 2-3 wears and they hurt her feet. At least they match her costume, but overall disappointed."
2,Cheaply made,I bought this product for 3 year old neice .. shoes didn't fit properly and my neice was very upset .. the material ripped as she was trying the shoes on .. very cheaply made and not very durable for child's play .. extremely disappointed.
2,shoes don't fit,i bough these shoes in two different styles for my kids to wear for Halloween and to play dress up in. they didn't fit at all. my kids are 3 & 5. shoe size 8 & 9 (juvenile). theses wouldn't even go over their feet. a waste of money. spend a few more bucks to get ones that your daughters can actually wear.
1,arial shoes,"the hellsare to big and the shoes are narrow for my grandchile the other shoes i bought fit her i""m disapoint with them.i have alwas happy with anythine i ever bought.i also did't likr the crowen.it's all twited i'm real sorry i got these item's"
5,Very detailed instructions,"Very helpful book, very informative and detailed instructions. You'll not regret getting it."
3,Home Decor,Too many curtains/drapes & not enough other home decor items. A nicely done book in all if that's what you're looking for.
1,"Very sweet, decent hot coco, but not drinking chocolate to me","To me, drinking chocolate should be thick, nearly like a melted chocolate bar in a cup. This wasn't anything close, and way too much sugar."
1,Not durable,"I bought this as a gift for my mom because she needed a new purse & she likes the backpack kind. After only a month or two, the zippers came apart along the seams. The fabric the zippers are mounted on is so thin it couldn't stand up to normal everyday wear-&-tear. It also doesn't seem like it's real leather as the description claims. I was so disappointed. Her previous purse lasted about 8 years before the zippers failed & the liner ripped. Definitely don't buy this as a daily purse."
1,This is worse than Dan Brown,"Edo Nyland lives in his own make beolieve world, and has no knowledge worth sharing. I would advise bypassing this book. I wish I had."
4,Super fun and reasonably priced PC game!,"I have downloaded this game before for about $20, but the computer I downloaded it to crashed recently and I can't live without this game! This game is so much fun and particularly easy. I gave it a 4 star overall rating because the graphics are so so for a 2006 game, but I do recomend this product."
5,entertaining,"I bought this game for my 12 yr. old daughter. She was so involved and so entertained I felt like she wasn't even here. But it teaches things such as patience, math, and involves different types of stratagies and thinking process'. Anyway, she loves the game and would recommend it to others. CAUTION... can be addictive. Jokin' Have FUN!!!"
4,Very entertaining game....,"The overall view of this game: you actually determine the outcome by buying pieces of equipment. If you are eager to upgrade your bakery every chance you get, you don't get some of the better pieces of equipment, however if you are holding out to buy the most expensive item then you are hurting your chances of completing the level. It is a great game, and can make you lose all sense of time once you start. Just be warned: Don't start playing this game if you need to get other things completed, cause most likely the other things will never get done."
4,Fun for all ages!,I have really enjoyed playing Cake Mania Deluxe. My 3 1/2 yr old granddaughter loves to watch while I play. I am sure she will be trying it before long. This game is very challenging as it progresses and you have to be quick. I had a couple of levels that I thought I would never get through but eventually I did. I would recommend this game.
5,Great Game,I love this game! This game is great for kids and adults who are looking for fun without having to commit to a major story line.
4,Foley is Good is Great!,"This book is a perfect extension of Mick's previous #1 seller Have a Nice Day, and if you haven't read Have a nice day, please do so because Mick takes you back a few times within his newest best seller and you wouldn't know what he is denoting unless you've read it. Great humor, intense writings (EPILOUGE), and even some very in depth emotional writing that can bring you to the point of tears(refering to the loss of his friend and co-heart Owen Hart). I'm glad Mick Foley is a writer but more of a realist especially when sorting through the wrestling hubbub and his real life with wife Collette and kids, Dewey and Noel. I personally think the literary world has a true blue writer on their hands. Get ready to be given the double arm DDT!!!"
4,Great followup,"Mick Foley hit a goldmine in realizing his literary talents. His first book, ""Have a Nice Day"" was superb and could draw in readers from wrestling fandom to booksnobbish backgrounds. ""Foley is Good"" does the same, with a little more emphasis on drawing in the booksnobbish this time around. He takes a lot of intellectual standpoints in the course of the writing (i.e. the PTC, backyard wrestling, real life being faker than wrestling!), dissects and explains them, which was something he didn't do too much of in the last book. Truthfully, I enjoyed ""Have a Nice Day"" better but I wouldn't go without ""Foley is Good"" in my collection!"
2,Foley Is Not So Good,"Foley should have waited a few years before putting out a new book. After reading about his Death Matches and his massive blood loss, I really don't care what his top 10 favorite Christmas Carols are. Some parts of this book seem useless. Even though this book gave me many hearty laughs, it can't even compare with his first book. This book is for the non-wrestling fan."
4,Not as good but still good,As a wrestling fan I could listen to Mick spout stories about the guys all day long. He's a really talented author. I don't think this book will appeal to the non wrestling fan as much as the last. But if you read the first it's definitely worth your time.
5,Mic Foley is back,"After the success of Mic's first new york best selling book, Have a Nice Day, I wasn't sure what to expect with this book. His format is a little different but all the jokes and fun are there. Just within the first 3 chapters Al Snow was already being put down. I enjoyed every minute of this book and was not able to put it down. I highly recommend it!!"
4,Good read,"Foley is a good writer, has a great sense of humour intermingled with some insights into the world of professional wrestling.Very much not the stereotypical wrestling thug but a man with an opinion and the ability to voice it.This book is not as good as his first book but it is still an entertaining read. Just wish he hadn't toed the WWE line and said that he hadn't seen anyone use steroids there. Bit fanciful."
5,Vincent Foley is Good,This is a great book that on covers the truth about WWE and micks life.This book tells so much about the super stars of the WWE but you really have to be a fan of the WWE to like this book because it talks about wrestlingthis book also talks about the CEO of the WWE and what a big jerk he is it also talks about what his carer was like at WWE. This is one of the best books I have ever red in my life .This book is so exsiting and thrilling I have great confidence of you loving thi book
4,Not as good as the first,"After three days of non-stop reading I finally finished Foley is Good, and although the majority of the book was really enjoyable, this book was no where as good as the first book. Infact sadly the last third of the book is a bit of a let down and kind of boring, he just stops talking about wrestling and goes off in a number of different topics. Another problem I had with this book is Royal Rumble 2000 and Wrestlemania 2000 seem to be missing. On the plus side Foley finally discusses the one thing missing from his first book DRUG USE. I guess the reason Royal Rumble 2000 and Wrestlemania 2000 are missing is Mick Foley is thinking of writing a third book, that would be interesting"
5,Foley is the Best,I loved Foley's first book and couldn't wait to read this one. I wasn't let down. This book is an excellent read. He voiced his opinion on kids watching wrestling and parents letting them (which I happen to agree with most every word he said). There were stories in this book that were so funny that I actually laughed outloud. I do disagree with those who say if you are not a wrestling fan you won't like it because I think everyone would like this book.
5,The Best Book I ever read!!!,"This man is my idol. He's a wonderful human being, father, wrestler, entertainer, and now author. I'm not a big fan of books, but I can't put ""foley is good"" down. It's just too funny, informative, and entertaining. I have to read more of it now...BUY IT!!!"
5,Mick Foley is the man who got me interested in wrestling,"Before I first read 'Have a Nice Day' I looked down on wrestling as no more than redneck entertainment. While I was at a friends house one day I picked up the book and was instantly lured into the world of wrestling.'Foley is Good' is just as good, if not better. While the book doesn't seem as much an epic(yes, epic) as his first, Mick certainly keeps it entertaining. Between the constant rips on Test and the Mean Street Posse and the occasional uppercut and knockout to Al Snow, this book had me laughing through most of it...All in all this book is a bit of a different style from 'Have a Nice Day,' it's just as entertaining."
4,foley is great,mick foley does it again. mick shows us that he can write another book. he tells the truth about the life he lives. mick is a hero to us all. he takes the time to show us how to under stand pro wrestling. so as a best seller i give this book a 4. because he told his storie. now what. thanks snake
1,Foley Is Not So Good,"After reading about his death matches and massive blood loss in the first book, do you think I really care about what his top 10 favorite Christmas Carols are? Foley should have waited a few years before he wrote another book. Plus his dissapointing book signing made the book alot worse to me."
4,Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker Than Wrestling,"I found this book pretty good. It does pick up where his first book leaves off and addresses the concerns some people have with pro wrestling,and his comeback attempt.I thought it was better than The Rock's book or Chyna's hardcover book personally. In my opinion,the first book was better,but a solid effort nonetheless."
5,"""Foley Is Good"" Proves That Foley Is God","I had very high expectations for this book. After reading ""Have A Nice Day!"" (My Favourite Book of All Time) I was jumping for joy when I heard that Foley was writing a sequel. Well I got this book on the day it came out, and I am not dissapointed at all. It was worth every single penny I spent on it. This is a must buy for any wrestling fan as he provides action, constant suspense and of course a lot of humour. This book was not as long as the first one, but that doesn't bring my opinion down to much. Now stop reading my review, and buy this book!"
4,Good but Different,"Ive been an avid wrestling fan for at least 15 years now. Call it an addiction if you will because I have also read almost all the autobiographies out there. By far Foleys first book was the best. In terms of story and more than that, they way Foley communicated with the reader. His second attempt I felt was half an autobiography and half ""state of pro wrestling"". I found this book extreamly interesting in a different matter than the first book in terms of content. He spends a great portion defending pro wrestling as a whole as well as the mastermind behind it all, Vince McMahon. The bottom line is that for someone who has had their head bashed in one too many times, Mick Foley writes an intellectually stimulating, entertaining, and educational book that touches on alot of issues that are going on in the world. I highly reccommend it"
4,More of the same...but the same was good!,"Anybody looking for something new from Mick Foley should look elsewhere. This book is the perfect sequel for anybody who loved ""Have a Nice Day."" Fortunately, I did. Couldn't put it down, and finished it in one evening. Two thumbs up, way up."
4,WHAT A FUN BOOK TO READ !,This is one of those books that you just can't put down. Mick Foley has a true talent for telling great stories. I hope to see another one in the near future. It's true ! It's true ! FOLEY IS GOOD !
5,The best logbook for the new century,"It was the best one in this century, might as well stay the best for 2000! Concise, easy to use, and filled with pithy, running-related quotes. Have used it exclusively for my log keeping for over a decade now. Bonus: each month features an essay by the author giving us a glimpse into his running life and how he views the world."
1,Kosmic Consciousness,"I received the audio book in a timely fashion. This was the first time I have ever purchased a ""used"" item and I will not do that again. The first disc of the set was so scratched that it skipped, jumped and eventually would not play about half way through. It was so off putting that I put the series away and have not listened to the rest."
2,"Nice, but not as good as ""Long Distance""","This is a good selection of great songs by a great band. But (apart from the fact that this CD is a cheap cash-in on their success by their former record company) if you are looking for a good overview of Runrig's songs, you'd do better to look for a copy of ""Long Distance"", which contains a selection of songs by their own fans, and which is sanctioned by the group itself. It lacks two or three songs from this album, but adds many more great ones, seventeen in total. ""Beat the Drum"" misses several, like ""Alba"" and a live rendition of ""Skye"", that moved me a lot."
3,"Record Company ""Cash In"" on success",This album is purely a cheap cash in by Chrysalis records and has NOT been sanctioned or approved by the band. The tracks are re-releases of the band's first three singles with Chrysalis and as such are owned by the record company. The record company are trying to make money from the Runrig name by selling old material from their archives now that they have parted company from Runrig. There is a NEW ALBUM due from Runrig at the end of February so save your money and wait for the new album with the new lead singer Bruce Guthro.
3,....Problem with Greatest HIts,"Do or Die is one my favorite groups, ever. But they put some songs on this CD that don't deserver to be here. 3AM, Can you make it hot, Bustin Back and a few others aren't really that great. Where is A-mode, Menage A Tois, Cold World, Lil Sum Sum, Pimpology an Dead or Alive. Meh. Good CD, but not really worth the money, since you can make your own personal Greatest Hits CD with songs that deserver to be on it."
3,A get-a-grip look at the power of suggestion,"This 1937 AMORC look at curses and self-hypnosis holds up nicely, through years of further investigation. AMORC founder H. Spencer Lewis explores various scientific and medical data on how someone may be ""poisoned"" by negative suggestions or trains of thought, pokes holes in many common misconceptions (including stories of Egyptian tomb curses and the like), and gives a Rosicrucian-based framework for dismantling one's fears on the subject.Like many of Lewis' works, the book sometimes takes itself (and its ad copy) a mite too seriously, and of course it amply promotes membership in AMORC. Nonetheless, I found the book informative and insightful, as well as an entertaining read. Good for persons curious about the ins and outs of self-suggestion, along with Rosicrucian students (and buffs)."
4,A good quick read on an important subject,"A small, quick read, on a very important subject. There are more in depth books available on the subject, especially today. But this book does a good job of showing the importance our thoughts hold, for our own well being, and all others as well. I enjoyed it."
5,Best Travel Guide for New York,"I bought this for my upcoming trip to NY, and it has been very useful in showing how to see many great places at little to no cost...very worth its weight and price!"
3,The best things in life are NOT free,"Sometimes you need to pay for stuff in order to get stuff.Someone has to make money somewhere. There are great free things, such as a few of the plays - but don't expect broadway.Getting on the Today show was free.Central Park was free.The Staten Island Ferry was free.Other books give better travel advice than this book and don't limit themselves to just the free things."
4,great book!,Used this book this past weekend in New York City. It was very helpful and the tips were great. There was also some great maps that came in very handy.
5,very good,"I'm satisfied with the book, but I haven't had the oportunity to try something out - we are going to visit New York at the end of the year."
3,Old version,"It's okay, but i will recommend that you buy the newer version, it's no easy to read with the android kindle."
2,Better for people who live in New York,I bought this for an upcoming trip to New York. It seems as if this is written geared more towards people who actually live there not for people who are visiting
2,shipping costs???,Why is the shipping for this listed as $5.49 but in the cart it's $8.00???$8.00 is ridiculous.
2,"Good Price, Bad Book","I only paid 25 for the book, plus shipping and handling, and it was like new so I'm very pleased with the price. However the content of the book is far less impressive. I can learn most anything if given an adequate explanation. And that's the problem I have with this book. It doesn't explain things well enough. Maybe it would be suitable for someone who already has a thorough understanding of calculus but not for someone who is just starting out. I have other Schaum's Outlines with which I am very pleased but this is not one of them."
2,"Good as supplemental text book, NOT good as primary textbook",There are not enough examples to explain everything you would need to know. I've found I had to go to the web or other more basic Calculus books many times to try to solve some of the problems in there. There are better books out there for those of us looking for complete breakdown of the problems and better explanations.
4,Good exercise,"It's easy to use. It really helps thin the mid section. Ease of use, get on it and get to work. Very happy with the purchase."
3,I think it's a OK product,"I like it, as I can do exercise in a small area. Im not using it everyday but I think its a OK product."
5,Nice addition to fitness toy box,"I have a box where I keep exercise equiptment that the kids can use whenever they want without supervision. My fitness toy box. This twist board is a nice addition to the toy box. It is good for twisting. Use the resistance tubing for balance when twisting or for curls. The kids, 4 & 10, actually have fun trying to use it. It serves it's purpose of giving me a good twisting exercise and inspiring the kids to use it. 5 Stars because it is inexpensive and totally usable by my family and me."
2,semi-satisfied,"I had used the same product before a couple of years ago at a gym, and decided to buy my own. When it arrived, the product appeared to be in excellent condition... However when used, it made an extremely loud noise unlike the quiet whirring of the one I had previously used. It almost sounds like nails on a chalkboard as the base rotates. the product works, but it is hard to get over the screeching to use it!"
4,Seeing Results,"I thought I was doing the moves wrong at first because it was so easy. I mostly use it for the resistance bands to work my arms. I really do feel a difference in my arms - they are much tighter after only one week! My boyfriend even told me he saw my shoulder muscles developing the other day, so that's a good thing! I like to use it while watching TV - I do it during the commercials. I also run 4-5 times a week, so I would recommend a workout routine if you are looking to lose weight. Just using this product alone wouldn't do it.Side Note: Not that this matters (unless you have OCD) but the item that was sent to me was blue and the picture showed it as grey."
3,Twist board has a loose screw:),"I really love this, it works great except... the screw/nut keeps coming undone, and if you don't notice it and tighten it, well it comes apart. This is fun, turn on some music and you can have a great work out almost anywhere."
5,Great gift,"The salad set is beautiful, shipment was quick especially just prior to the holidays, and it made a great gift."
4,Not so challenging,"So far the puzzles might better be described as moderately difficult, not challenging, but they meet my needs and are a good value."
4,Better than most,"Cryptograms aren't widely popular and only a handful of such puzzle books and magazines are available compared to, say, sudoku or crosswords. Publishers are starting to oblige our niche market, but product quality is inconsistent. Some packaging is inefficient or downright irritating (laid out by people who seem to have never done a cryptogram), some are unimaginative and recycle common quotations, some have errors, some are too easy or kitschy. It's been awhile, but I remember thoroughly enjoying this book. In addition, for those who don't have it, Elonka Dunin's Secret Codes and Cryptograms is the most fun and engaging book available in this category. I'm still working on the metapuzzle."
3,"Great photos, but lacks the stories","Sins of the City is a great picture book, with awesome images of pre and postwar Los Angeles noir. But it does lack the stories behind these images except for a few captions. I was expecting to find more text on L.A. noir and was a bit dissapointed. This is a great book to look at after reading ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Farewell My Lovely"" by Raymond Chandler. 3 stars for the great photos."
1,"Too many pics, no written content","While the pictures are plentiful, they are a bit boring. Below average even. You should exit stage left before paying $ for this book."
3,Sins of the City,"Awesome pics, but not as graphic as I would have expected. Not much coverage on the Black Dahlia case, but it was all inclusive of Los Angeles from the 20's to the early 60's. Overall, it's pretty cool, but it reads very easily and very coldly...a very non partisan POV, which helps. It's like watching ""Mysteries and Scandals"" on E! Television, but with less detail."
2,Tips over easily.,"Could be a good toy if it didn't tip over so easily. My felines were interested but the games were over within the few minutes it took for it to fall over. After a few days of me righting it, they gave up on it completely."
1,No hitter,My 5 year old cat who loves toys wouldn't even try this one! I can't recommend it unless maybe for a kitten who is very curious.
1,Not overly interesting,"Sadly, the Tick Tock Teaser arrived broken and we had to wait for a replacement. We have 5 energetic and playful cats. Sadly they were not interested in the Tick Tock Teaser and it just sits there waiting to be played with."
3,"Well made, but my cat ignores it","This product is well made, but my cat ignores it. I think it needs to swing more freely and have more bounce."
3,its ok,Alright I ordered it. It was not everything I wanted. The toy moves back and forth harder than I would like. I thought it would be a little looser movement. He really had to work to get it to move back and forth and some cats won't want to do that much effort. Maybe I can find a way to loosen the screws or oil it.
2,Completely ignored.,"You never know with cats, I guess. But my two rambunctious kittens, who usually loves toys, didn't even look at this. They simply sniffed it and walked away. Even when I started the rocking motion myself, they just ignored it. They did like the box it came in, naturally. I gave this two stars only because it seems to be well-made, sturdy wood contruction like the peekaboo toy box made by the same company, which the cats do love."
3,"Durable Toy, BUT my cat won't play with it!","Perhaps this toy is better suited for a kitten, but my cat just won't play with it. He was initially interested in it, but only preceded in grabbing the tassels and dragging the whole toy across my living room...There is nothing wrong with the toy itself, and it is very durable and well built."
1,Boring!,"My cats are not at all interested in this thing, no matter how much I try! I wish I had not bought it."
3,Who Knows With Cats?,"Our three cats pretty much ignore this. In fact, they'd rather play with the box. Reminds me of children I've known and raised! :)It is well made and Should appeal to cats. Maybe your cat will like it. Maybe I should sell a mostly unused one here."
2,was hoping for better,"though it's a well-made toy, my 4 cats weren't that thrilled with it. a big part of the problem seems to be the fact that the pendulum doesn't swing very freely. i loosened up the holding screws a bit & that helped but still only minimal interest from the cats :-("
4,The current favorite toy,"Got this for the gang of 10, and it was a hit right out of the box. Came right before Christmas. The three youngest (4 and 5 months old) and the older Siamese (4 years old) are still fascinated by it enough that I move it out to another room at night. So far the everything is still intact; it seems very sturdily built.The tassel seems to be the most fascinating bit; the ball and mouse below are second choice for targets. Worth the price in this household."
3,Good Cat Toy,"My cat seems to like this toy, however the little mouse that is supposed to swing back and forth, rubs on the wood to much and doesn't swing very well."
4,Decent webcam,"Well made with a good picture.The cable is shorter than listed by 2"" (no, I will not return it).Some of the features I liked were removed when I updated the software from Logitech.The update was needed as my system does not play well with webcams (any webcam not just Logitech).Given less features and system faults, I finally switched to MS Windows default driver (error free, no special features).It was inconvenient to install, but I am satisfied with the outcome."
2,Not as good as it was,"I have the original C900 (usb vend:prod id 046d:0991). The C905 is the new improved version (supposedly). While there are some new nice changes (more formats) and the price is lower (about half), the quality is correspondingly lower. It is not ""Pro"" quality. Some of the best capabilities are lost (low noise, good low light response, user focus function). It is simply on par with other similarly priced cameras. It is not a ""nice"" camera, it is an ""ok"" camera."
4,Great Notebook QuickCam,"This newer notebook quickcam has features not found in the older cams.I like the automatic light sensing adjustment, and easy focus.If desired, the contrast and other light features can be adjusted manually. This is a great item for the price."
5,web cam,"I purchased this for my son who is in collage so he could keep in touch with the family while away at school. It works great, now instead of just talking on the phone we can actually see him and his roommates. I would defiantly recommend this web cam to anyone on the go"
4,Great Camera,This is a great webcam. Picture is clean and crisp with minimal delay.The only problem I have with the unit is the mounting bracket. Logitech was sub par on the design.
5,Excellent Little Camera,Does the job very well and clips nicely onto my laptop. Works well with Skype. Good value for the money.
4,Plenty of value and fun for the money,"Very pleased with the cameras ability to adjust to different lighting conditions and give good zoom and pan views.Only problem I noticed is chasing the focus; any movement in front of the camera will put it in a mode trying to auto-focus and lose focus of the main object. The setting to follow a face, although it sounds impressive, it did not work satisfactorily; it kept going in and out of focus.Ok, probably is a matter of settings but I played with anything available from the configuration/control screen and I couldn't improve it.In conclusion, much better than other web cameras including Logitech products."
3,good image,"After changing 2 logitech cameras finally I can say that I've found a better one. the image quality is great, but the echo is just horrible even with echo cancellation:( I'll keep this camera but not impressed with the sound quality"
5,"Very Good Camera, Works with Windows 8","I bought this camera when I bought a new laptop and it didn't have a camera. I realized it after I bought it and upgraded it to Windows 8 and it couldn't find camera drivers. I did a lot of research before buying. I was looking for small, clips to laptops, HD video recording and Windows 8 compatible. It has all that and a little more. The glass lens is a great extra since it is clearer and harder to smudge and damage. It has a case for travel. It has a desktop stand to attach to when at home. It has worked great with my Windows 8 laptop. The video has been very clear for Skype. The audio has also been really clear. It might be an older camera, but definitely still very good."
3,Not For a PC,"Video guality is very good, audio is very good, software set-up ran smooth. However, the webcam can not be clipped to the top of a desktop monitor. It's a small clip and will only fit a laptop. It does come with a plastic pedestal. You can clip the camera to the pedestal and place the pedestal on your desk. Not a good option for me. The USB cable is short - again, fits a laptop, not a PC. Finally, getting the thing out of the bubble wrap was a big chore - you have to totally destroy the packaging and be very careful to not cut the contents with your electric saw."
1,is this 2008?,"On a new desktop computer with a broadband internet connection, the quality of even this upper-end webcam is not acceptable. The only plus I see with this product is that you don't get the rounded edges of the image that you would associate with webcams in general. Still, with long lag times, sound that is delayed, and fuzzy picture quality, I won't bother looking into using webcam technology for at least a few more years. Unless the parties on each end have good lighting (more light shining into your face than behind you is the key), the latest and fastest computers, fast internet speeds with few or no people downloading in your neighborhood, and high end cameras, the webcam experience is still downright brutal. And even if you do have all this, it still is in the beginning stages. Having said all of this, I do not think this is mainly a manufacturer issue, but more a technology issue."
3,Not good if you aren't sitting in front of the computer,"Quality is good when you are sitting right in front of your computer which makes this item useless for any other purposes. Focus don't reach more than 2mt distance. Not so good in poor light conditions. You may want to buy this webcam only if your laptop doesn't have a built-in one. Ok for Skype on Win7 x64. Overall, not satisfied. You get what you've paid for I guess..."
4,"Really good camera, pictures a little misleading;","I was expecting the stand to be a lot taller, because I know it would not fit on my monitor, so I'm, hoping I can find something to extent it at some time. If you get this skip the disk and download the latest drivers from the site works way better."
4,"Longer cable, please.","This is one of the best cameras for the price..but, as many who own it know already, the attached usb cable is a bit short....(not a problem after I added a long extension)..setup is easy, features are good..sound is good..and with a long extension, it is versatile. Logitech is a trusted brand."
4,Don't buy Logitec based on a rebate.,"The product is fine and with the rebate the price was fine too. The problem begins when you send in for your rebate. The bastards at Logitec will tell you something like they didn't receive your bar code labels (I taped them to the rebate form) and screw you out of your money. If you're buying because you want this particular model and price is no big deal, then go for it. If you're buying because the rebate makes the price too good to pass on (as in my case) DON'T BUY IT!!!"
4,Great little cam - the best I've seen,"I've tried out quite a few cams over the years, and this is the best I have used. The image is sharp, not grainy at all. The color is realistic and the included software makes adjustments to contrast, color saturation, etc., a breeze. It works very well in low light situations, thanks to the RightLight(tm)2 Technology.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I found the auto-focus to be a little slow at times, but if you're just sitting in front of the PC it is not a concern. It could have been because I wasn't using enough light. Others' experiences may be different, and I wouldn't consider it detrimental enough not to use the cam. It's excellent overall.The cam is tiny, even smaller than I expected. You can carry it in your pocket or use the little case they give you. It's only two inches by one inch and thin, too, even with the clip on the back."
3,SloW!,"The camera is good, I like the quality, the zooming and the focus.It's designed for Skype but works the worse with it. It actually hangs the call up just when I start using it. Sometimes it works just fine.All other Apps work great with it. Like OovoO, it starts right away.With Skype it takes about 10 seconds to start, and might work, might not!The mic is Aweful, just to be honest.The stand that comes with it is not that useful because it's not stable.The software of the camera is very good and it has many convenient options, in terms of quality, screen size, web streaming and Still images.The HD thing is not that good, but it might be only because of my low RAM in the PC.I hope this helps.Good luck shopping!"
1,poorly designed,I am disappointed in this webcam. The cable is way to short. It is poorly designed and keeps toppling over. Not interested in Logitech's webcalling. Was looking for a bargain but spent money on something I can't use. Usually like Logitech products but not this one.
4,I Like It,"I purchased this cam for a webinar I was doing. It was easy to set up and worked ""out of the box"". Price is good and it is good looking. It met my needs precisely."
5,Great Webcam!,Lite and portable. Great picture quality.Right-light system works better than expected.Overall outstanding.
5,Wonderful,I love this product and bought one for my mother as well after seeing how easy it was to install and how clear the picture/video was. Very easy to install no issues. Two other members of our family bought a different product and both had problems with the install and getting the webcam to work correctly. I highly recommend Logitech and this model.
4,It's perfect,It's perfect for the price. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Clearity is very good. Great quality. I have purchased additional cams for friends.
4,Not too bad.,"This is a great webcam for the money. I know Logitech just introduced 3 new HD webcams so I guess Amazon was just trying to clear the shelves. I haven't figured out how to change video quality while video chatting with another person. I'm not sure if that's even possible but I will see later. Overall, good camera quality, accurate, and easy to use. Only negative is that the price went down another $7 the day after I bought it.Note: Be sure to download the new software from the Logitech website because the software included is an older version."
4,Best desktop/laptop webcam I have used,"Hands down the best desktop/laptop webcam I have used. Video and audio quality are fantastic at default levels. I also appreciate the travel case and stand (when using it as a desktop WC). Clip works great on my Thinkpad. The drivers did not automatically install via the CD process; however, I was able to do it manually with zero issues. HIGHLY recommend this webcam ... nice job Logitech and nice job Amazon for the price and free shipping."
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro for notebooks is a fantastic deal.,I can't believe how well this little camera works! [...]. It works great. The picture is crystal clear. The setup was simple and 5 minutes after I loaded the software I was on line with my sister at the Cape from my house in New Hampshire. She purchased the Logitech 9000 Pro and both cameras did an equally great job. I would have bought this camera a lot sooner if I had known how inexpensive and easy to use it is.
1,Could not install.,"Every time I tried to install this device, it crashed my (very new) system. My screen just went grey, and I had to restart. I tried using the software on the enclosed disk as well as downloading the drivers from Logitech's website. Always the same outcome. Too bad."
3,Open box,"I would not recommend ordering this from Amazon as the box the product was in (not the bigger, amazon box) was opened and was not in good shape at all."
1,Be Warned - Clip Breaks!,"I've had this webcam for probably 2-3 years now, and have been consistently pleased with its performance. However, this morning the clip that attaches the cam to the laptop broke. Cam is extremely well cared for, so this damage occurred only through regular use. Looking at the clip, it seems very likely to be a design flaw. I wouldn't buy this product again, based on this problem."
4,Nice laptop camera!,"Just want to add my two cents worth...I've bought this about a month ago. Have been using it with my sweety since then - she's using the same exact webcam.The web cams that I used to own waaay back when are lousy under low light and thus you can't see anything, but this one is great under low lighting with the 'right-light' technology. It also has a few special effects that you would enjoy. Only complaint would be that the stand that it came with (bonus in my books) - in order to use it, you need a longer USB cable that is integrated with the QuickCam Pro. It needs to be longer or at least allow you to extend the cable so that you can make use of the stand. Otherwise it is the perfect length if you're simpy going to clip onto your LCD."
3,"Nice Camera, But","Like the camera, which also has a built-in mic. Comes with a nice soft sided carrying pouch. Takes good pictures. On the down side I have 2 laptops and one of them has the Windows 2000 operating system, which it's not compatible with. Really wish it did."
2,I am disapointed,"I bought it to record videos for youtube, and I am so disappointed in the video and photo quality as well, i can explain it why or why not you buy or don't buy this one, but lets say; i would go for something better than this one in terms of quality"
2,Bad Autofocus,"the image quality is GREAT,but the autofocus is so bad,,if you move just a little the autofocus try to work and the images always is out of focus because of this feature,,the idea is good but the results are bad"
3,For face to face visits.,"Again, I gave this as a gift to my son who is enjoying it. We visit often as he is in another state."
4,Nice web cam,Works well with skype and other apps. Face centering and auto focus are a real plus. Avatar's don't work with skype but that wasn't a real issue for me. Uses a lot of resources.
5,Extraordinary WebCam,"I have used Carl Zeiss lens sets on several other components and knew I couldn't go wrong. I did get one bit of advice that was helpful since I was setting this up on my wife's laptop for Skype, do not install the software that comes from logitech. The Skype and Logitech software conflicts, so I didn't install but let the windows plug-n-play find the hardware and recognize. A couple of quick adjustments with the wizard and we were up and running. No issues and this product is performing flawlessly, clear, good light control, excellent sound for our beautiful grandson. Amazon had a good price, and I like the new brown box shipping. Couldn't be happier."
2,It doesn't work on Vista,"After installing it on Windows Vista and rebooting to system, it stopped working. I repeated the process several times and never got it to work. I tried it in another computer working on Vista and couldn't even complete the installation. Even the most recent version of the driver didn't solve the problem. I installed it on Windows XP and worked just fine. Video quality is good and works with both GMAIL and SKYPE."
5,Skype friendly!,"I'm not sure why several people complained about this camera with Skype, as I've had NO problems what-so-ever! Install camera software, install Skype, talk to people with beautiful video and crystal clear sound! I'd buy this camera again in a second."
5,Excellent Laptop camera,"This is a great camera for those on the go and even those desktops which are stationary. I was so impressed with the first camera, I bought 5 more of these to give to other family members. The sound quality is great, you don't even need a microphone. Not to mention the video quality, just amazing. I would highly recommend."
4,impressive cam,really nice cam with unique application program. enjoyed the video quality but doesn't follow a person properly during the chat.
5,"Nice cam, simple interface","I bought a web cam several years ago, difficult to use, poor quality, never really used it.This web cam is easy to use, lots of cool features, I LOVE IT."
4,****AT LEAST FOUR STARS****,Worth the money...Definitely an improvement over the one I bought(also Logitech)at Kmart. Autofocus AND noticibly sharper focus. Exactly the same set-up but without the need to focus.
2,Nice camera - bad experience with software installation...,"I think few would be disappointed with the web cam's performance and features. My personal experience with the supplied software was poor.The installation took a long time and ultimately crashed my laptop with a blue screen error. My wife tried to download the Logitec Vid software and could not get it to load past a few percent of the download. This overall installation process also resulted in our internet service going down twice. I had to re-power the cable modem after each installation attempt to restore it. This was baffling!It's also worth mentioning that I am PC savvy and evaluating video related software is part of my job. I walked away from this product after no small effort to make it work. However this did not include talking the time to call tech support. In less challenging times, I would have hung in there and figured this out. However with two young children, I hardly have time to order stuff, let alone fix it."
4,Good product. Works with MAC with additional software,"Bought this so I could read my 2 year old her book while on the road.Using it with a Mac Ibook. Had to install additional USB driver software to use with Ichat.All in all a great product, but you have to do some homework to make it work with a Mac."
5,Worked out of the box on my Linux machine,My computer is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. I was able to run Cheese Webcam Booth as well as Skype just by connecting the camera to the USB port. It would have been nice if the USB cable was slightly longer. I am connecting through a USB extension now (no issue with that).
2,"People are complaining about my ""echo""",I haven't had time to research it (time is valuable) and see if I can fix it but the vocal echo is proving to be a problem on conference calls
1,less quality than expcted,i know this is now a really old product but the quality was just lacking for me. my phone has better picture...
2,Poor Quality for High Price,"i bought this webcam because it was the ""best"" quality one i could find that is compatible with linux.but i found that the images are pixelated, and the mic is poor quality.the last webcam i had was built in to the laptop, and was a generic thing, but it worked better for picture than this does."
4,Works with Skype 4.0.xxx,"I bought it and had the same problem with Skype (as reported). I was close to send it back...But than I downloaded the last version of Skype (4.0.xxx) and now it works very fine.The cam has a very good quality, is small (easy to take with and good covered with the bag) and the software is easy to use (and has a lot of good functions).So after a ""rough"" start I'm really happy with the cam."
2,"Worst design, so-so software, great quality","First bought a Microsoft webcam first but didn't work well with Yahoo IM! Then bought this after reading reviews.Pros:- video quality is good.- you can create quick video files.Cons:- I have a Dell and an IBM laptop. The clip is not working well. Very poor design. It keeps moving from the edge of the screen. The grip is not strong either.- You will not be able to use this webcam with a regular LCD since the screen edge thickness is more than 1/2 inch.- Their software is very buggy. It takes over the Mic input. I have tried many combination in the last 2 days and as soon as I connect my headset, it stops working in Skype and Yahoo and MSN.- Design again: there is no way to roate the webcam. No rotation axis.- The great Lens (Zeiss) is very much unprotected. They should have created some kind of concave design like the Microsoft ones.I still can't believe they missed the clip design that bad...I do recommend Logitech but not this model."
2,see it before u buy it,"this webcam doesnt fit with any laptop, the laptop has to be super slim. the cable too short in case u use it with desktop. too expensive"
4,good camerawith short cord.,the camera is very good but the 3' cord is to short for normal use-need at lest a 6' cord for normal use. So plan on spending another $31.00 for an extension.
1,"Severe out-of-focus for use at long range, for multiple units","I bought 3 of these at different times; one batch of two, then later a single unit. All three are out of focus irregularly across the field of view. If you're looking for good close-range (a few feet) pictures, this is not a bad choice. Use at long range (a nature scene viewed through a window) turned out to be woefully inadequate. I set the focus controls to manual and did a ""live"" adjustment of the focus, and yes I'm sure that the control is as good as it can be set, it's maxed at distance. Typically one side of the picture is blurry at long range but picks up some details sharply from the scene that are a few feet away, whereas the other side seems to be focusing at the middle distance, rather than at long range. It would seem that the focusing system is defective for long-range use. One positive point: when the sun is in the frame, these units do better than cheaper units in avoiding total washout. For what it's worth."
3,Plodding lacking in dramatic intensity,"This interpretation is dull with plodding tempi and little dramatic interest or accent, and for a work of such length (3 hours and 20 minutes) is really too much to take. There are of course some fine moments on the part of the soloists however. Recently Nicholas McGegan recorded this work in a very good interpretation for Carus records, but probably the best version is the Leppard recording on modern instruments for Erato.Handel - Samson / Tear J. Baker Watts Shirley-Quirk Luxon Langridge A. Oliver Burrowes Lott ECO Leppard"
3,"Good, but limited info","The book is well organinzed, though an index would be helpful, and all descriptions are well and clearly written. It has good information on various trail hikes, but if you're looking for guidance reaching some of the higher mountains in Weminuche, this is not the right resource. It doesn't make an attempt to provide that information."
3,Metal Masterpiece..?,"They're a decent band but are easily the most over rated. ""Ascendancy"" was -not- their debut album, that was ""Ember To Inferno"". There are plenty of better bands out there. Trivium are not some kind of metal savior these reviewers make them out to be. Those that say they sound nothing like metallica are kidding themselves, at least even a little. This is no masterpiece."
4,Great,"This album has a much more traditional metal sound unlike Ascendancy which is pretty much strait metalcore. If you liked their last two releases...or even if you didn't, check this one out."
3,Where is the Agression,"Embers to inferno was very good, Ascendency was great (top notch progressive metal with great timely vocals and brilliant sweeping leads). What in the world happened to them in this album and what were they thinking? My first thought was that their trying to go radio freindly and also trying to sound like Iron Maiden.. case and point the song ""We are Fire"" does it get any more Iron Maiden then that? Any way I dont understand why they decided to go in that direction, their last album they sounded unique.. In this album they sound just dry and boring at many moments.. There are moments that the music picks up and gets charged but, it never attains a climax like they accomplished in Ascendency... If trivium is trying to be the next Metallica they better realize that metallica didnt get lazy until they reached mainstreem recognition after the black album.. Trivium is a long way from that so they better start realizing who they are and what they represent which is aggressive metal."
1,no..no...no!!,"well after listening to the album 4 times tryin to let it grow on me..its just not gona happen..i see a lot of arguing betwen the the lovers and the haters on this cd..true!! there is a lot of the same old rock/metal out there that can be slightly compared to triviums last album..but one person hit the nail on the head with ""whats next rip off gnr like avenged did?"" and its really the truth..i respect that they have made a change into what they think is progression..but it is not the case..matt heafy should have stayed to what was his own..but in all non-bias honesty it does sound just like james hetfield there is not doubt about it..and alot if the lyrics are very simple and need to say cheesy..i think these guys can play i think they are talented..but this was not the way to go.p.s. as far as the metallica royalty subject goes..every metal band on earth would owe metallica royaltys for the path they laid...but i dont know when testament sounded like metallica."
1,blah,"i have to agree with alot of people on this review im sorry but trivium turned into a wuss band now the first 2 albums were good but this one is crap they let all that ""the next metallica"" crap go to there heads and now they sold out and suck they need to go back to the old style this stuff where the lead singer dosent scream is crap start screaming again and maybe i will like it this album just wasnt trivium in any way so basically this album blows compared with there other albums"
4,Lick my Love Pump,"I really think these guys take more influence from Megadeth than Metallica. Anyways this album is damn cool. Not as good as Ascendancy but still better than most of the crap out there. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because Matt Heafy can't write lyrics to save his life. ""For Your Honour..You will slaughter.. Everyone of Your Daughters"" Come on, just because verses rhyme doesn't mean they belong together in a song. Whatever, buy it anyways. My favorites are Ignition, Detonation, And Sadness Will Sear, To the Rats, The Crusade, Contemption Breeds Contamination, and Becoming the Dragon."
4,"Lyrics SUCK, Musics Great!","I love Trivium. They're a very talanted band. The Music in this album is amazing, The Vocals are great, I just cant stand the lyrics. Almost every song sounds like its lyrics were taken from old news paper clippings. There's that gay shepard kid that was tied to a fence, The Dad that killed all his daughters because of adultery, the cops that shot that ""innocent"" person 41 times and more. Is this a new Genre? News-Metal?"
2,Disappointed,"I loved their first two CDs so much that I was going to buy their next one out of loyalty. I was apprehensive at their plan on changing their sound to reflect what they listened to more (as a million other people pointed out here, that would be Metallica). So, I got the CD with an open mind and I really don't like it. Only one of their songs sounds like their older stuff (Ignition). Two other songs on it are ok, so I'm giving it 2 stars rather than one, because even though I didn't like most of the CD or the direction they are heading in, I did like some of it.So, the fact that I gave it two stars would be most relevant to those who liked their old stuff and don't like Metallica. If you love Metallica AND their old stuff, this might be a 5 star CD for you."
3,"Actually, it's more like a 2.8 . . .","Ember to Inferno was Trivium's first CD. A great piece of work, considering they were four guys making an underground metal sound.Ascendancy is their second. Sure, they began to become more mainstream, but they improved their sound from Ember. An absolutley amazing ORIGINAL sound.The Crusade is probably one of the biggest let downs of this year. I really hate to say that about such a talented band as Trivium, but what reasoning would make them give up their original sound to be more like Metallica? Why would you want to sound like a band who years ago declared that ""Metal is dead?"" Heafy and the others are extremely talented musicians, and it shows in the actual songs, but the singing style is totally different.Why did they sell out?"
2,Politically correct metal,"This album recycles some good riffs from the 80's but you can tell these guys are right out of high school by reading their lyrics - the English class PC brainwashing hasn't quite worn off. They also use the thesaurus a little too loosely: ""Wed-locked a prison Of antiquation"" Good lord who wrote that? Their music may be copped from Metallica but the lyrics are something you would expect from Natalie Merchant (for you younger people she was the singer of 10,000 Maniacs in the 80's - a favorite of unpopular drama club girls who blamed all of their personal insecurities on society, patriarchy, sexism, homophobia and Ronald Reagan)."
2,I expect more from a band with creepy CD Covers,A friend of mine recommended this band to me. While I do value his opinion I was not impressed by this record. I have not heard their previous releases and I may give them another try but The Crusade is very tame and watered down. With this effort Trivium appears to trying too hard to emulate the mainstream successes of their influences. There just isn't anything here that I have not already heard - I actually had some weird 1986 flashback while listening to this. The flashback was fun the CD is disappointing.
2,Very disappointing for me...,"BTW, not a kid, but the whole account thing was annoying. I was expecting so much more out of Triviums next album. Ascendency was the best album I ever heard, with great vocals and amazing music. The Crucade had the same musical talent as the last album, but the vocals didn't work for me. The whole Metallica thing was quite annoying and I really missed the great singing and the old singing voice. I guess Trivium was looking for new things, I don't know why, but this album just didn't cut it for me. Still, Ascendency is defenintly something to check out of you are looking for something heavier than this album."
5,This album does NOT sound like Metallica,"I know lots of people are complaining about how much this album resembles Metallica. But think again: is Metallica as melodic as Trivium? It is only the vocals that resembles James Hetfield and that's all. They sound more like 'At the Gates' with clear vocals, if you want to compare them with other bands.This is a great album if you like thrash metal. This album doesn't contain as much 'emo screams' as their previous 2 albums, so avoid this album if you are one of those old fans who prefer their 'scream'. But fundamentally, Trivium still sounds the same with their guitars, bass and drums.Songs that I liked: Becoming the Dragon, Entrance of the Conflagration, And Sadness Will Sear, The Crusade, Detonation, Anthem (we are the fire)"
4,Bringing back speed metal,"i was a huge fan of Ascendancy and i liked the growling hard vocals but mostly i liked the music, with guitar solos and longer than 2 minute songs.. This cd Heafy does more harmonizing and really does not growl to much. i still like this cd because the music is fantastic..there needs to be more guitar solos on cds..so you lose the ""cookie monster"" vocals but pick up a better overall cd. has ""ride the lightning"" type of feel..i mean they have an instrumental song on there..fantastic!"
2,A huge letdown,"If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's ""Master of Puppets."" In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on ""Ascendancy,"" and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.From a fan whole absolutely loves their first two efforts, I give this album two thumbs down!Please, for the love of (insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here), revert back to your original sound, Trivium!"
2,eh...,"That's what comes to mind, ""eh"". The feeling with this is album is pretty much like this: Why listen to ""unrepentant"" when you can listen to ""Through The Never"" by Metallica? It's pretty much the same riff and you're not there thinking whether or not trivium ripped Metallica off on purpose. Why listen to ""detonation"" when you can listen to Sabbath's ""Children of the Grave"". Same feeling with the rest of the album. If you're somewhat well versed in metal, you'll find other songs like that. These guys have some serious talent. They're first album was great. There are other issues that I could've dealt with, like the singing change, etc. But as much as I try to like this album, I can't get over the fact that it sounds increadibly like a lot of my other, older metal albums. I'll just stick to Ascendancy for now."
1,A Bad Conclusion to a Great Selling CD!!!,what the $#&* is this??? trivium present the crusade......music and lyrics written by metallica??? ok its good saying who inspired you growing up and even doing a cover song of the band.... but coming out with a cd thats sounds exactly like them....Posuers!!! worst cd ever thank god i gave it to a friend for his b-day and i listened to it then. not worth buying!! if u have this cd sell it on amazon and hope some one wants it.
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I hope Trivium reads this. Trivium had been the cream of the crop with their previous two albums. Much as Metallica did in the 80's they revolutionized Metal by taking it to new levels. The ""Crusude"" by no means follows the revolutionary ladder that previous works had. This album is to Trivium what the black album was to Metallica. One that they will probably disown down the road. Please resort back to ""Ember to Inferno"" and ""Ascendancy."" Those two albums were masterpieces. ""Crusade"" is a disaster."
2,Thanks for selling out again metlallica!!!,"wow i have to say i was so dissapointed with this trivium album, i really liked their debut ember to inferno for those idiots who dont know and ascendency is probably my third fav cd of all time. this cd sounds like james from metallica was like hey matt here are all the songs we did not use on kill em all, ride the lightning and master of puppets so go ahead and just use them on your new cd and what they got was a cd of pure crap other than maybe 3 or 4 songs. i dont get why you would drop the scream, other then 2 songs where it is just a small part of screaming the rest of the cd is the old metallica style trashy metal singing. i was so pissed after i bought this cd and listened i put it in my cd binder where it will remain until i get to drunk to remember it sucks then pop it in again and go awww crap what is this nonsense, dont buy it just d/l it or burn it!!!"
2,"Sweet, Metallica....Oh its just Trivium","Yes like everyone is saying this sounds a bit like Metallica, and Trivium now sounds as gay as Matt Heafy looks. Their last CD Ascendancy was very good and help popularize Trivium. Now they are going where the money is. Matt has droped the harsh vocals to sound very much like James Hetfield. This will undeniably appeal to a much wider audience as the vocals are a lot friendlier to non metal heads.Trivium is however very talented, all members of the band are very good musicians and The Crusade does have some very good thrash riffs and memorable moments. But seriously one of those emo-fags could sing better that this. I have tried numerous times to listen and like this CD but the vocals completely ruin it for me. Ascendancy's vocals were just right, harsh but not painfull to listen to and you could make out the words without reading along. Im sure this album will sell many copies but I will not be buying their next one."
1,Metallica are bad enough......,"Trivium are not remotely thrash. Seriously did anybody actually listen to this album? Well I did, Trivium are not the ""saviors of metal"" or anything of the sort. First off metal doesn't need to be saved, it need's you little mallcore fags to start looking in the underground for good metal. For good bands currently making music check out: Necrophagist, Ghoul, Frightmare, Anata, Vile, Agalloch, Isole, Circus Maximus, Symphony X, Iced Earth (new allbum in '07), Sodom, Napalm Death, Tankard, Diablo Swing Orchestra, Yyrkoon, Phobia, Unexpect, iron Maiden, Blind Guardian, Candlemass, Deicide, Lord Gore, Hirax, Sadus, Eternal Tears of Sorrow,etc. Go shop at hot topic you attention seeking scene pricks."
1,Generic,I would've given this band a 5 but not until they hand Metallica and Megadeth all their loyalties. This is a big ripoff of old Megadeth and Metallica. Shame on these guys for lack originality.The Rats song is a perfect ripoff of Rust In Peace.What next guys? Ripping off Guns N Roses like Avenged Sevenfold did?
2,"I read in a review ""THEY SOUND LIKE METALLICA ON THIS CD""","Unfortunately, they do. Their SECOND CD IS GOOD and that's it. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS (the 3rd cd) ONE. Nothing innnovative or great about the singging. That's enough to turn me off of it. Please listen on their myspace or on amazon. It's bad. I would have listened more to hear their usually great instumentals but couldn't get past everything they sound like now."
4,"trivium ""the crusade""",very fast shipping but the condition of the case/cd was much more like fair/good rather than new as it was listed. i have had no issues with playback so in the end i'm still satisfied.
3,Mediocre at best.,"You know why Trivium are the NEW Metallica??? BECAUSE THEY RIP THEM OFF IN EVERY ASPECT THEY CAN...Ascendancy was an amazing record, dont get me wrong, but these guys lost what they had for originality... this album IS STILL GOOD, but i find nothing new or original or even memorable about it. they took many steps backwards. my opinion."
2,Ride the Crusade,"Metallica has finally returned to form with their new magnum opus Trivium:The Crusade. I'm just shocked that they didn't mention this album in their most recent news letter.I've been a senior member of the 6-String Snake Metallifan Club (awaiting the results on the VP election) for over 14 years now, and this cd will undoubtedly be in rotation at our next regional event -- 10x blacker than the black album! The review below doesn't lie; truly one more inch to rock out with."
1,noodle nonsense,Quite possibly the worst excuse for music I've ever heard. It's bands like these that make me embarassed to call myself a fan of metal.
2,What The F*ck Happened,"I am a huge Trivium fan but this CD is terrible. I believe they are trying too hard to replicate Metallica and that is not possible so the result comes out horrible. Other than the self title track ""the crusade"" and ""entrance of the conflagration"" this CD is not worth a Dam."
3,"I like it, but not as much as Ascendancy","I'd give The Crusade a 3.5 star rating (I'd give Ascendancy 4.5...I love that record). I like The Crusade a lot, but it took a few listens to grow on me. It's an entertaining listen with solid riffs and nice leads and solos. Some of the lyrics are good, some not so...I do appreciate the obvious political/spcial themes of some of the tracks. I do like the singing, as I'm an old school metal fan, and I don't consider it a sell-out as many have called it. However, I got to know Trivium through Ascendancy, and later Ember to Inferno, and the change on The Crusade kind of threw me for a loop even though I knew before hearing the album this was the direction they were taking. I used to hate the screaming and Ascendancy was one of the records that finally got me to ""get over it."" lol Anyway, this is a good record with obvious Metallica, Megadeth and Iron Maiden influence on it. If you like metal without the screaming, this is definitely worth picking up."
2,This is Trivium??,"One of the earlier posts recommends listing to the album multiple times before judging it in any way. I've given it multiple listens, and I still can't get myself to like it, or believe that this is Trivium. For someone that REALLY liked Ascendancy (me), this album is a poor follow up. I'm a guitar player, and the reason I initially got into Trivium was for the great guitar work these guys do. This album offers excellent guitar playing, but everything else pretty much sucks. 5 stars for the guitar work, 0 stars for the rest....an average of 2-3 stars overall. It's much lighter than Ascendancy, primarily due to the ""melodic"" singing that Heaffy does. Plus, he needs to find better things to sing about. And it's sick how much these guys want to be Metallica. Overall, if you're looking for some solid riffs and solo's to listen to....buy it. If you're looking for a worthy follow up to Ascendancy....don't buy it."
3,"Decent, but dissappointing","After 'Ember to Inferno' and 'Ascendancy', I was expecting great things from 'The Crusade', but felt a little bit let down. The vocals were the main issue for me. The mix of loud harsh vocals and calm melodic vocals are what made me fall in love with the two previous CDs, but the majority of the vocals in this album sounded Metallica-ish to me, like newer metallica, not good metallica. There are still some great tracks on it, but if I had to give one of my Trivium CDs back, it would be this one."
1,Masons: The misunderstood fraternity,"The author makes some interesting points about where a Mason's true allegiance lies. Sadly, he is wrong. The Masonic belief is (in order) God, Family, Country, and Lodge. How this can be possibly construed to mean that they are at odds with christians, or catholics, is both unfounded and a misrepresentation of fact. Any reader interested in learning more about the Fraternity would be better served starting with one of the hundreds of books available on Masonry. My sense is the author has some other agenda at work here."
1,Awful,"This is possibly one of the worst books on abortion I have ever encountered.Her metaphors of Artemis, etc. are lovely, but her facts are all over the place. She makes comments about religious beliefs that are so overgeneralized they are quite insulting, and her wonderful facts about the children of the world come from 1989... this edition at least was published in 2007!!!! Beyond that, she makes outrageous claims such as that overpopulation is singlehandedly to blame for war and the abuse of children, with nothing to back this up and nothing to explain this link.Don't waste your time."
1,What a gross misunderstanding!,"Anyone who could say that abortion is a choice to not create a child has blindly missed that by the time abortion is being executed, a child has already been created. Anyone who could deem the killing of a child as a sacred act lacks the necessary understanding to write a paragraph on the subject, let alone an entire book!"
1,What a waste,"The author is suggesting society would be better off to regress back to paganism, archaic morality and behavior. Has she never heard of adoption as an alternative to killing a baby?"
3,Just what I thought,"It is clear why so many women have flocked to abortion clinics. Abortion truly is a sacred thing, when viewed from a satanic perspective, it is quite clearly an offering to satan himself. Good men and women have nothing to fear from these pagans. Our enemies it seems, are killing themselves off."
4,"Great color pictures, current styles, some instructions.","I am a professional home-dec seamstress and use this book for client reference. The vivid pictures are of fully, beautifully decorated rooms in various styles. Many are easy to recreate. However, for those needing detailed instructions, you would need to find a pattern to recreate some of what you see in the book (like the valance on the cover). Good hints on choosing style, fabric, and on measuring."
1,Do Not Use,"Ordered item blindly. Product came WITHOUT any instructions for use. When contacted supplier, was told that there was NO warranty. In other words...Tough !!! Do NOT recommend this product to anyone. I tried to use it only one time and ALL my eyelashes broke. I got NO satifaction from supplier. Its been one whole week and I still have NOT received any instructions like they promised. Maria"
1,"very thin, won't last long",These folders are at best for temporary use. If anything more is required we used better quality folders. They serve a limited purpose.
5,The Baroque Spirit,"Frans Brüggen clearly demonstrates in these recordings that he is, indeed, the recorder master! The ensemble revels in the baroque spirit creating one of the most obvious examples of baroque small ensemble playing and interpretation. With a laid-back and relaxed feel, the ensemble rides the ebbing and flowing tempo together seemingly without effort, as if the rhythmic wandering was self evident in Handel's composition.The recording is very good for the technology of it's time. Just the right amount of room ambiance accompanies the clear and detailed sounds of the delicate instruments.The work of oboist Bruce Haynes is on par and in the same spirit as Brüggen's recorder playing, making this a magical compilation of recordings!Comparing these recordings with the likes of Michala Petri and Keith Jarrett's recording of the same compositions shows a night a day difference in interpretation.The recordings in this collection are simply magical."
5,Awesome music,"Even if you're all, ""Inu-wha?"" this is still some excellent music. True, it is even more fun to listen to if you've seen the anime, but the quality of this soundtrack cannot be denied. Some tracks are action-packed, some are beautiful, and some have an almost Stravinsky-esque feel to them, and all the instrumental tracks have an orchestra with *real* instruments. Oh, and the CD liner notes have lots of pretty pictures and a few tidbits if you can read Japanese.I'm a bit bewildered as to why Amazon has it so expensive, though. You can get it for half the price, easily, through z-Shops or other import sites."
5,^_^ WOW!!!!!! ^_^,"Amazing CD, one of the best Inu Yasha OST Cds yet if ya ask me.Though, I'm not discrediting the first and second ones, those are really good too.The music on here is very meaningfull to the series, you just find yourself reminesing on the halarious parts of the series, the sad parts, the romantic parts, and every one's favo parts, THE VIOLENT SCENES!It's really worth it to buy this CD, You'll love it, Inu fan or not.Okay, so, "" I am (TV size)"" Is VERY VERY VERY Jumpy.too much jumpy.waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much jumpy.yet, the recorded version is adorable, and I found my day's not compelete with out hearing the recorded version of it.Okay, before I start ranting, I'll just put,""IT IS WORTH IT! YOU'LL LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
1,Raw and rotten recording,Undeniably the WORST recording quality from a well-known band that I've ever had the displeasure of trying to listen to.
3,Don't buy them if you live in mountainous area!,"We live in mountainous areas of the North East. We are lucky if they work 2 miles. We starting picking up other people's conversations on the first day, and they heard us too. Not good for children to use (which is why I bought it) I thought I could have used this with my son who is seven to talk to me while I was at work on weekends. I lost him before I got out of our town (which is about 2 miles long) If you live in a mountainous area.... just buy the 2 mile radios because you won't get much more than that."
2,shipping was a Joke,The package was shipped DHL but was delivered to the US Postal Service for them to deliver to the work/business address. I lost the ability to track the package when it was delivered to the USPS. I have no faith in the USPS and if I would have known that is how they were going to ship it I would have paid more to have it not shipped threw them.
3,Walkie talkie,"These are ok, kind of difficult to figure out all the buttons and options. Easy to hit the wrong button, sound ok but muffled."
3,Good radios for the price,"I purchased these radios to use on a cruise and they worked well all over the ship.I can't say much about the range since the ship is only about a 1,000 feet. But the signal went thru alot of walls throughout the ship.The battery life could have been better, but they seemed to last about a day so we just recharged them each night.One thing to note, they mention weather updates on this radio and that is false. There is no weather service option on this radio. Some of the ones just a bit more expensive do have that option.The volume control with 2 buttons isn't as nice as the turn dial control on some of the nicer models.But for the price, this is a good radio.One final note. A previous comment mentioned that he wouldn't use this until he could pay for the license. There are many channels which are free (lower power) so you don't have to pay for the license. And additionally, in my case, we were out in international waters, so no laws applied."
2,"junk,",i purchase this tv and it was nothing but a disapointment.picture quality poor.don't waste your money on this spend a little more and get a better one.i returned it the next day for a refund.
2,Great Picture; Poor Sound,"I was impressed with the reception and quality of the picture, however the sound was so poor I had to return the product. The sound is distorted and I had several others listen to so I could be sure it was not just my hearing. I wish the sound had been better so I could have kept the product because the picture is really great."
3,Worth getting but the price tag is somewhat high.,"In the case of such reference books as the one reviewed here ""Dynamics of Droplets"", the whole purpose of buying the books depends on the need for it ie a particular reason. In my case I was interested in the splashing impact of water droplets on hard and liquid surfaces. It must be kept in mind that reference books are general references and not intended for a specific purpose. As such, this book provides a rudimentary introduction to my area of interest. It also covers the whole range of droplet interactions not only experimental results but the whole study of droplets experimental, theoretical and computational. A very wide introduction, based at times on the research of the two authors and their research institute.Its good as a general introduction but don't expect too much in your area. Worth getting but the price tag is somewhat high."
2,Sound Issues,"This TV is fine in every respect, except that it has ""Sound Logic (Auto Volume Correction)"", which is supposed to dampen the loud sounds and amplify the soft sounds for you. Unfortunately, it overcompensates and turns action movies into a tortuous ordeal. It took us a while to really figure out what was going on, but by then it was too late and we couldn't return it. There is no way to disable the feature.If you like silent movies, this is the TV for you."
5,A beautiful story to read again and again,"This book by Leslie Connor captures the life experience of a young immigrant woman who comes to the New World with only a shovel. We see through her eyes the ways her life changes through the years, as she uses the shovel to stake out a place for herself, marrying, having children, running a farm. Although it's not a long, complicated story, the richness of the book lies in its reflection of how life progresses and changes through the years, with both love and loss. I have read it to my children again and again, and each time I feel that Ms. Connor has captured some essence of life and change that will make this a book my kids will want to have for their entire lives. It's truly one of those books we'll treasure. The elegant pictures by Mary Azarian complement the story perfectly."
4,The miraculous return of Lance Armstrong,"While the majority of the stages are covered in a couple minutes, most of the 8hrs are spent on the 4 mountain stages, resulting in the best images from this tour. We mostly witness the battle opposing Armstrong, Zulle and Escartin, the major players. Other riders such as Virenque, Etxebarria, Heulot, Tonkov, Guerrini, Cippolini, Livingstone and Team Kelme also offer inspiring performances.Minor glitches in the filming cause some forgettable image problems. Having to switch DVDs in the middle of the action while training is somewhat disturbing. Some time spent discussing the doping scandals. Most of the Tour deciding crashes are not on film.Great replay value. Awesome while indoor training."
5,If your a fan this is for you,I just got into the Tour de France in 2003 and really had not watched cycling events at all before that. With the advent of the OLN coverage and my own renewed interest in the sport that all changed. It was really interesting to watch the 99 tour to see how it all got started. I found it quite exciting to watch some of hill stages and see what a really dominating force Lance was going head to head against the best in the world. Paul and Phil's color commentary was great and all the boring non eventfull flat stages are condensed.
3,Disappointing Sound Quality,"I have heard of these sonatas for years, but had never heard them. I chose the Casals/Serkin set because of my familiarity with other performances by him. Although Casals and Serkin are unassailable as interpreters and performers, I found this set disappointing because of what I can only describe as ugly sounds - there is a harshness to the sound quality, at least in places, which I think is probably to be ascribed to the age of the recording rather than the performance. Still, I found it jarring, and it marred my enjoyment."
5,EPIC OF A FRIEND,"Russian Pop Composer, Igor Krutoy introduces his first Solo instrumental album, ""...Without Words..."" with a touch of class. Krutoy's songs take you on a journey, making you think about life and love. The most powerful and probably his biggest Number One hit is the ballad in memory of his father, Track #5 ""When I Close My Eyes"". Two music videos have been shot for this song. The first version of ""When I Close My Eyes"" features Igor Krutoy's home videos with family and friends, driving in his black Mercedes. The second version features two famous figure skaters on red ice, skating around Igor Krutoy, playing on a grand piano covered with ice.The album also features excellent tracks like the unforgettable melodic piece ""Tenderness"", the jazzy ""Pink Smoke"", and another hit single ""Epic Of A Friend"". The best feature of the album is the Robert Miles's styled Dream Remix of ""Epic Of A Friend."""
3,Got this as a Joke for my cousin,"I purchased this as a joke gift for my cousin who likes cuddling up with his blanky in front of the TV at night, and is in his 40s - and obviously a Vikings fan. It is nice & soft, and pretty good quality."
5,Great for sports fans!,I got this one for my son and it's so fun! I wish I could find one in Green Bay for my nephew!
1,good tool,"Shears are excellent. Good feel, heavy blades make cutting through backbone far quicker than a knife blade. Cleaning is a breeze."
5,Cuts through chicken like butter,"These shears came highly recommended by my favorite recipe blogger and I couldn't be happier with their performance. They replaced a pair of Henkel shears I've had for several years that I paid three times more for but just weren't that sharp, even the day I bought them. While you're supposed to be able to cut through chicken bones with most Chef Knives, I wouldn't dream of using my best knives on such as task as the nicks and dings on the blade that results, just aren't worth it . . .and the task is made so much easier with these.The soft, easy grip handle is very comfortable, though it's important to keep the hand in the grips from touching the chicken to avoid the handle becoming to slippery. The blades easily separate for cleaning and snap back together and have a closing pin on the handle to keep them closed for storage.Aside from cutting chicken . . .they work great trimming artichokes as well. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
1,Too Expensive; Missing Pages; Disinterested and Disappointing Publisher (Sage),"This book was very expensive (over $40 dollars, only a few hundred pages, and paperback), was missing about 30 critical pages, so I returned it and bought another,as I needed it for a class I'm taking. Getting the book expressed mailed was very expensive, so I had the expense of buying a second book and getting it expressed mailed to me. When I contacted the publisher, Sage Publications, they refused to help and stand behind the integrity of their product. They said it was probably an anomaly, I got unlucky, and it was just too bad that I was going to have to return it and pay more for the privilege of having a book I thought was complete, like most books, and I'd ordered well in advance of my class. It was a big inconvenience, not worth the price, and Sage Publications should be ashamed of their poor customer service."
5,Fantasticbooks meams what they say and say what they mean!,"I was really excited when I received the book. Fantasticbooks stated that the book was in ""new"" condition and when I received it, it was. I also appreciated getting the book via USPS as opposed to other carriers. I like receiving the book in my PO Box instead of hoping that I am home when the other carriers come. I will continue to use this vendor as I continue to buy textbooks! EXCELLENT~"
5,The Honest Answer,This book helped me a lot in my decision as to the benefits and detriments of using creatine. It is unbiased in its factual base yet a large portion is about proper use of the muscle builder in case one decides to use it. A must for anyone considering this product.
2,Did not fulfill my expectations,I was expecting to see more elaborate illustrations. I purchased about 5 Tasha Tudor books at the same time and probably should have sampled only one before purchasing more. The kids were not cute enough. Everything was washed out and vague. I would not recommend this item.
2,A Time to Keep,. The pages were dull compared to the old copy I have which is rich with color. I was disappointed.
3,"Super adorable book, but printed in China","I don't exactly make the kind of dough to buy a first edition Tasha Tudor book (unless I were to luck out at someone's yard sale the way my mother has), so I ordered this re-print. Once again, I am disappointed to see that the book is printed in China. This was purchased as a gift for my mom, and I am sure she will love the book, but I also know she will be disappointed to see that it was printed in China. I think it is important to offer new printings of these timeless classics, and the printing of the art is very nicely done, but I just wish that publishers would discover how truly affordable and beneficial it can be to print in the U.S."
2,Not the same,"I thought this favorite from my childhood would be great for our girls. But the illustrations are not the same at all. They are fuzzy, oddly colored and lacking in those sharp details I loved. How could I get the 1972 edition?"
4,A True Story,"My grandfather was a civilian during WWII and was one of those ""Trapped with the Enemy"". James O Thomas tells in detail of these years and the hardship that the prisoners encountered. Thank you for a gift to our family. This is history that we had only heard as short stories from grandpa."
4,Hotheaded Saints,"I found Taylor Barton's novel to be thoroughly engaging and difficult to put down. The characters were well-rounded for the most part, with most of them being just despicable enough to seem real. The men in her story were mostly weak and reprehensible, which might put some men off, but in the end there was enough redemption to go around and plenty of hopefulness, leaving me with a good feeling. If Taylor writes a sequel, I would very much look forward to reading it."
1,This is one of those self published jobbies.,"iUniversal is a self publishing company, you pay them some money, they give you the finished product. This is one of their books.No real publishing house would touch it."
5,smead file folders,Works great for a large amount of paper that you need to refer to. I use it for real estate and its perfect for my needs.
1,Received the wrong product!!,"I otdered a TURKEY panek roaster to use for Thanksgiving Turkey in our Green Egg Grill but I received a smaller checken roaster so I had to return it. The shipper said the turkey one was NOT available when I ordered it on Amazon.com which was pictured as and named as a Spanek Vertical Turkey Roaster. I was very disappointed but don't know if it was Panek or Amazon's fault; however, I got a refund and will order it again."
4,Wonderful,The book was in really great shape for a previously-owned book. What an inspiring story. It came very quickly. Thanks!
4,powerful testimony,"So many of us grew up with Roe-vs- Wade, and now we can know the person behind the case. The story is eye-opening, not only to the power of God and the way He makes Himself known to individuals and changes their lives from darkness to light, but also to the politics of abortion in the United States. Reading this book made me look at myself and my choices as well as the choices of our lawmakers.I think everyone should read this book, especially before one votes again in any election."
2,Both sides now,"It was worth reading as a companion piece to her first book. Her religious conversion was neither insightful nor inspiring. Without the context of her first book, this one does not stand well on its own. Sounds like she was ill=used by both sides of the abortion debate."
5,excellent book,an excellent and soul searching journey told in avery readable - and often amusing - fashion. Wish everyone could meet Norma McCorvey. Her journey will inspire you.
3,Its a re-labeled Magnafine filter.,"After doing a bit of research I found out this is a ""magnafine"" filter with a Raybestos label in an ATP box.Only finished installing it today in my 2000 Honda Civic which has a small filter screen buried in the transmission and a magnetic drain plug. I needed some sort of extra protection for my trans and this fits the bill.Package includes the filter and two hose clamps.If u need or want a magnafine inline filter and can't find it anywhere else...this is it~UPDATE~ (5th Jan 2012)I am dropping my original score of 5 stars to 3 stars. My filter has developed a leak after approx 7000km of use. It's a small leak now but i am forced to change it in the event that the leak gets larger and most of my fluid is pumped out during any journey and ruins my transmission.I will leave it with 3 stars for in the brief period that it did not leak it significantly reduced the small ""filings"" that would usually be found on the drain plug magnet.It works just check it occasionally."
4,Good DVD,"Like watching on television. Not an HD product, of course, but a good reproduction of the TV presentation. There was some hesitation during the pre-game opening remarks as though there were DVD problems, but these only lasted about 1-2 minutes."
4,Good author,"I found this book to be interesting, and I have listened to Lutzer on the radio and enjoy his messages. I was also reading another book about heaven and I liked it better."
3,Don't forget,"That grace works yet we need to be converted not just think we can just believe only and that's all. Malachi 3:all- speaks about the fire needed to refine the dross SIN out of us which is mandatory. Repentence and the obvious end of the world time frame we are in is rarely talked about. It's the end of the world, repent and be filled with the fire and be converted is the most important issues and always has been. There is some information here yet it is not the main important issue that needs to be addressed. Get ready to meet Christ NOW and focus there."
4,It's a standard TP holder,"When we redid our bathroom, it took us awhile, and the original fixtures we selected got discontinued before we could buy the complete set. This line matches very closely, and we're pleased with the look. It's a standard TP holder, nothing fancy, well designed. After a year of use, we're having issues with the TP holder bar itself...it sticks in the compressed position when you take it off and reinsert it; have to tap it to get it to pop out fully. Will probably need to replace that next year. The finish has held up beautifully. Would buy from this company again."
5,Oldie but a Goodie,Mannequin is a great movie and number 2 is no less as great. I enjoy watching both of them over and over again. The price is right and I was thrilled to find out I could purchase them again after my original one had been lost. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a mushy yet funny movie.
4,Good for nostalgia,"I remember watching these movies as a kid. They are great for nostalgia. They are both rather cheesy. The second one being much more cheesy even than the first. BUT they are definitely worth it for the price. You can't beat 2 decent movies for this price... So, if you are a child / teen of the eighties... or just want to be... then these movies are for you."
2,hello,need change because say have audio and spanish but don't have only have subtitle for this reason need make change in tha information
5,Excellence,The Items recieved were in awesome condition and came very fast in the mail. THANK YOU!!!
3,Mannequin 2,I bought this primarily for Mannequin 2. I did not feel it was not as good as theoriginal Mannequin.I did receive fast service and was happy with my purchase.
5,CLASSIC!,Such a classic movie that this should be in everyone's collection. Love these movies so much! Definitely a pick-up for any movie buff.
3,80s Funnies!,"Classic 80s! I actually think the second one is better, but both movies are a good watch."
5,Mannequin Mania!,"Mannequin has always been my favourite 80's movie, it is just so funny, the stars really make it believable and entertaining to watch. The music is great too. One of Kim Cattrall's best films.Mannequin 2 - On the Move isn't quite as good but at least the character of flamboyant 'Hollywood' makes an appearance."
4,80's Fun,"These videos brought back fond memories (the first one more than the second).Mannequin was an enjoyable light hearted film and highlights the gorgeous Kim Cattrall, and teen heartthrob (at the time) Andrew Macarthy.Highlight is the gay window dresser ""Hollywood"" who is played over the top, but brilliantly by Meshach Taylor, he also reprises his role in II.It interesting to see early role of James Spader as the slimy Mr Richards, and GW Bailey (Rizzo from MASH) as the store security ""commandant"".Not a classic but fun and enjoyable none the less."
4,Mannequin & Mannequin 2,"I was waiting for Mannequin 2 to come on DVD, when I saw this I thought great.Brings back memories.Great movie's."
4,Half & Half,"Well, I guess it depends on which movie you're looking for as to the review. I've called the review ""half & half"", because I REALLY liked one movie and really DIDN'T like the other.I've always liked MANNEQUIN, ever since it came out. I love Kim Catrall as an actress, and I especially like her performance in this movie. Sure, it's a 'slapstick'-type of comedy, and an 80's one at that, but the charm is still there after all these years. The other characters' performances are less-than-perfect, but you have to remember when this movie came out.As for MANNEQUIN 2: ON THE MOVE, I can't say much POSITIVE about this one. It really has NOTHING in common with the first movie, except for the title (the concept is completely different), and the performances are completely inept. I basically figured: ""Oh well, I got it for free with MANNEQUIN"", and so I didn't figure I wasted my money (if I had paid extra money for it, I'd have felt ripped-off)."
3,Kim Catrall=Fab/Mannequin 2 =Drab,"I would give this product 5 stars if it were not for Mannequin 2: On the Move being part of this particular collection. I love the original Mannequin film for its campiness and, of course, Kim Cattrall! However, the second movie really needs to be attached to the first before anyone in their right mind would watch, or purchase, it.All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase because the good aspect of having Mannequin on DVD outweighs the bad aspect of having Mannequin 2 on DVD."
4,Entertaining Vehicles,"Both of these movies were entertaining vehicles. Do not look for Oscar winning plots, but the acting was excellent, the comedy timing spot on, and fun for a mindless night of watching a movie."
4,Great family movie,"Mannequin 2 lost some of fun that the Mannequin had but still realy good for a night in. If you love the movies that are easy to follow, with laughs throughout then these are for for you."
5,Happy Customer,Great movie . Dvd shows prefect . I say buy it if you love Romantic movies like this . Loving
4,Fast and New,Great experience! Shipping was faster then promised and items were perfect and new. Highly recommended.
5,I haven't had as much fun reading since the first Harry Potter!,"I enjoyed every minute!Ms. Carter put together a handful of delightful characters in a really inventive premise--genius girls in an all-girl spy school. Very fun!I'm a writer so I'm extra picky. Plus, I have the attention span of a gnat, but Carter kept me flying over each and every page. SO, don't miss this one! I'm adding it to my listmania and I look forward to reading her next book.And no, I didn't write this because Ally Carter and I are friends--we've never even met. It was the kind of book where you just HAVE to say something about it because it was sucha good read."
4,A great summer read,"This book was very good and a fun summer read. I loved the story and I thought it was interesting to read a love story with a twist. In most teenage love stories, there are a bunch of mean girls trying to tear down the main girl, but in this one, all of the girls worked together, and the only obstacles Cammie faced was the fact that she was a spy. It was something different for a change, and I really liked it for the creativity.The only thing that bothered me about it was that it was a bit cliche: Cammie lost a parent, and Josh had some problems with his parents. But otherwise, it was just a fun summer read. Hope there's a sequel.I recommend Gone with the Wind, as well. Now there's a love story!"
5,I want this book,"Reading the reviewers' reviews made me want to find this book. I don't care if it takes me around Malaysia because I am a book collector and this book perfectly fits in my collection. The other reviewers' reviews are really helpful because I am looking for a new book. I just finish reading Susan Davis's masterpiece 'Mad, Bad and Dangerous'. Football match has started, chow!!"
5,Can't wait for the sequel!!,SPOILER!I loved this book. I just wish it had a little more of the spy action in it and the ending bothered me because why couldn't her mother trust him. That's why I am so excited for the sequel to find out if things end up the way I hope they do. It reminds me of Hogwarts in a different setting because it's a glimpse into a world we don't know.
5,Id tell you i love you but then id have to kill you review,"This book ""Id tell you I love you but then id have to kill you"" had me turning page after page eager to find out whats gonna happen next.Its about a girl named Cammy who attends the Gallagher Girl Academy, a school for young girl spyes in training, but its a secret. Everybody outside from the school thinks that its just an ordinary bording school for rich, spoiled girls.When Cammy is sent on a ""practice"" mission out into the town fair, she runs into a guy named Josh. Afterwards they start having secret meeting places out in the town. It is hard for Cammy to sneak out of school but luckly she doesnt get caut (or does she?).I loved this book and i hope that you read this teen romance novel. It is a verry good book..."
4,"Cute, fluffy, fun!","This was one of those fluffy cute books that reminds you of fluffy cute Disney movies like Starstruck or Princess Protection Program. It's unrealistic and silly, but it's okay because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Gallagher Girls is just plain fun!The main character, Cammie, is a teenager in an elite spy school. She ends up meeting a townie, a local boy (Josh), that she falls for. Sneaking out to meet boys is completely against the rules, so hilarious hijinks ensue as Cammie tries to pretend to be normal for Josh while dealing with a new teacher who takes spy school to a whole new level.I'm definitely planning to continue reading this series as I get them from the library. Very cute story!"
4,An Interesting Read,"This book, which is the first in the Gallagher Series started off with, what I thought was no promise. The plot seemed predictable and I was sure I knew the whole of the book in the first three chapters or so. I was so bored with it I stopped reading and didn't start up again until three months later. It really suprised me! The whole relationship with Josh didn't turn out like I had predicted and it really got a lot better after the first few chapters. I really reccomend reading I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have To Kill You."
5,If it was a food it would be mouthwatering!,"This book by Ally Carter is a fun, action-packed book that all girls will be eager to read and have. For myself, I just couldn't put it down!"
3,What happens when spying isn't enough?,"Book #1 in the Gallagher Girls series.Cammie Morgan, aka The Chameleon, is a sophomore at Gallagher Academy. Gallagher, while masquerading as an elite prep school, is really a boarding school for girls in training as spies. Cammie is a legacy--her mother is the headmistress and her father was killed while on a top-secret assignment. Cammie enjoys her training, but things start to fall apart when she meets Josh, an ordinary boy who lives in the nearby town.Can she keep her true identity a secret?No real suspense or danger, but an entertaining read nonetheless."
1,I want to BURN this book!,"There is nothing exciting about this book. The entire time the author repeats the same things about the Gallagher girls and how they created everything spies use today. The characters are all dull, to a point where you can barely remember their names. I kept reading thinking that something good was going to happen..nothing happened! I wasted my time, and note that I'm a huge fan of these kind of teen books, but this one was not worth it."
1,I want to kill this book myself...,"worst. book . ever.Obviously in the beggging it sounds like she is writting in a journal only to find out you a are wrong it is a overly cheesy wannabe book. I do not understand why it got such high reviews. I thought she was a bad writter it exscipally bother me how she said "" lunnch time "" Just randmoly in the book!! whhattt? I had to stop hafway throw to! ughh."
5,Amazing book!,Kept me in suspense! Can't wait to read the next one!She is a wonderful writer. Suzi is awesome too!
5,Why isn't this a Movie Series?,"It's ""Burn Notice"" for the teen and tween set. This first-in-the-series book follows Cammie Morgan, a student at (as well as the daughter of the headmistress of) the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a spy school for girls. When Cammie meets Josh, she and her spy-school friends take their covert-ops training from the classroom to the real world to find out what's behind this mystery boy. Is he a honey-pot looking to take her down, or an average boy interested in who he believes is an average girl? I'd tell you more, but then, I'm afraid the author would have to kill me."
4,Cute!,"Cute story, kind of like a Harry Potter of spies and for girls. Really grabbed my attention from the very beginning.I enjoyed this story, not much to say. Teenage girls would love fashion themselves to be a Gallagher Girl, I know my three would! A lot of it you just laugh at, I mean these girls really seem a bit more grown up than most.Good for a good laugh and fun to dream about though. A typical romance. Good beach read -- would be a good one to pop in for a fun gift...I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion."
3,Entertaining teen book about first loves and spy school,"A spy-school-romance book for young readers that is entertaining and well-written for the genre. Cammie is at an elite spy facility disguised as a rich girl boarding school, when she meets a normal boy. She's been raised by spies her whole life so she's not sure what to do about him. Nothing has prepared her for just being around normal people, especially when she can't tell them anything about herself.Cammie is funny and charming, and the language of the book matches that of a young girl. With the help of her friends, bookish Liz and beautiful Bex, she has to navigate the world of spying, schoolwork, new students and teachers, and of course, cute boys. She also has to deal with some tough situations like lying, secrets, whether to help friends and when honesty is the best policy.I would've liked some foreign intrigue thrown in, but as a quick read in the YA department, it does well."
4,Great for Middle School Girls!,Great Reads & strong characters! Teenage girl in spy school slowly discovers her parents' past and mysterious careers while she goes on dangerous missions.
4,fun book,i found this book interesting and fun to read. There were times when i couldnt put it down. Some were a bit slow though. Overall it is a good book
4,One flaw…,"This book is a really good book but sometimes when it speaks in different languages, it does not translate so you don't know what it is saying."
2,Repetitions,"The book's main plot is original, but everything else isn't. First of all, all it does is brag about how skilled the graduates of gallagher are. Cammie says ""I can kill a man 7 ways"" but I don't think she even can, shown in this book and the sequel. She always succumbed to boys and she couldn't even lie properly and she declares that she can kill a man 7 ways. Right. Also, I don't think the author should write a title that doesn't even corresponds with the book. I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have To Kill You? Really?I found this book immature and moronic."
4,Good fun or stupidly silly?,"People often seem torn between hating and loving these books so let me suggest the following. If you like disney movies like High School Musical, you'll love this fun and slightly slap-stick school for girl spies. If you love spies (and you're a teenage girl) you'll probably get a kick out of it. If you like more realistic spy books you'd be better off picking some thing likeThe Recruit (Cherub). Or for something funny but not so slap-stick go forThe Birth of Venus: A Catherine Lock, Art Restorer Novel. Or if you just want a feisty heroine go for Meg Cabot'sShadowland (The Mediator, Book 1)Hope that helps. And look out for the Disney movie of this book maybe coming soon... I will be!"
4,An Overt Fun Read,"This book was surprisingly fun to read. I loved all the characters and their quirks and eccentricities. I'm looking forward to reading Carter's next novel, Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy. This book was fast to read and had many funny moments. I recommend it."
3,from Maci H.,"I would give this book a 3 stars because at first the book is very boring and you don't understand anything. After you are on chapter two, you will start learning more about it. It took me a while to understand this book, until I was on chapter seven. This book is really about romance and school. So if you like the kind of books that have romance in it, then you will probably like this book. This book isn't that long, but when you start reading and when you get to the end, you will want to read more. That's what I hate-- I started to understand it but there was no more to read. Well, I hope this review will help you to find out about if you want this book or not!"
4,Pretty Fun,"I don't know why I kept putting off this series, I loved the Heist Society series and I knew this would be just as great or even better. This was a really fun story. I love the idea behind it and I was quickly drawn to the story and to the characters.I loved Cammie and her friends Liz and Bex. I wasn't so sure about Macey at first, but in the end I came to love her as well. It was interesting to see Cammie going through spy school and finally meeting her first boy. I felt so bad for Cammie, since obviously she couldn't tell him who she was and what she does. It really made you feel for Cammie and her not so normal upbringing.This was a great, light read that kept me entertained. It's well worth reading."
4,Courtesy of Chick Loves Lit,"Tirzah from The Compulsive Reader let me borrow books 1-3 of the Gallagher Girl series, and I was so excited to have them. One of my favorite book settings is boarding school, and that's exactly where these books are set (yay!).The main premise of these books is that there is a school for girls who are training to be spies. This means plenty of cool classes and tasks (all spy related, of course). These kept my attention the most, because I found the author to be quite clever with her use of the spy techniques the girls were using. I was also glad that spy techniques weren't abused - everything didn't always go perfectly for Cammie.I really enjoyed this book and am glad I have the next few in the series to read right away - I want to know what else they learn about spying and more about the creative spy school that Ally Carter has created!"
1,Poor quality,"I was excited to receive these shoes, but oh so disappointed when they arrived. The fabric colors of yellow and red show through the white rubber band around the sole. The seams of the rubber band were not connected or straight. Overall this was a poorly constructed pair of shoes. I immediately returned these shoes. I would give it zero stars if I could."
2,fell apart after 1 month,"the fabric on the bottoms comes off first, then the rub around the bottom, next thing you know your shoe is talking! Super cute though!"
2,Not the greatest recording,"Nice idea to have Casals and Stern collaborate, but the quality of this 1951 recording leaves a lot to be desired, notwithstanding digital remastering. Don't judge Violin Concerto No. 5 by this recording. The Itzhak Perlman recording on Deutsche Grammophon (Violin Concertos 3 & 5 with the Vienna Philharmonic) is recommended."
5,AWESOME!!,"This CD is from the heart of Wayman Tisdale. He truly allowed the Lord to use him. You can hear it in each of the tracks. It is amazing that this CD was recorded in 21 Days!! The CD contains excellent vocals, exhortations, and vocals by talented children. If you have purchased any of Wayman's jazz CDs, you will enjoy his first venture into gospel. This is a must buy for anyone who loves gospel music. Buy this CD and you will not be disappointed."
4,Great CD!!!!!,"This is some great gospel jazz work by Wayman. God has really given him a gift in smooth jazz music. My favorite track is ""Look At Me Now""!!! It is the jam for the year!!!!!!!!!! Wayman make more tracks like this, man!!! We want more gospel jazz by you, man!!!! The entire cd is wonderful though, and I really like the way he is working with the kids on the last track for they are our next generation and need true godly leadership and role models in their life right now. I am a true believer and witness that If any man/woman be in Christ, he/she is a new creature, old things are past away and all things become new when you give your life to Jesus. If you haven't tried Jesus, try him wholeheartedly. It's never too late to confess Jesus as your Savior. One thing you will never know is when you may take your last breath so why not try him now; give your life to Jesus and experience NEW LIFE?"
5,Encouragement for your soul!!,I really enjoyed this CD and it is still in my car CD player. When you hear this CD you will be encouraged that no matter what you are going through God knows and he cares. So while you are waiting on a change PRAISE GOD anyway!!
2,kind of awful,They are very short and run smaller than I expected. Not great for working out in because they do not have a lot of stretch- the only spandex felt like it was in the waistband.
3,Positive film with a positive message!,"This is a film that adults and mature teens can watch together. It shows that even in the roughest of times, faith can pull a person through."
4,"I love the music, but the album is a little short","This is a rare soundtrack, and I'm glad to have it, but the total time runs under 40 minutes, which is a shame because some of the compositions in the movie were not included on the CD"
1,Disappointed...,"While some may enjoy this movie, I was disappointed with the scene selections. Also, the editing seemed choppy much of the time. I should have saved my money."
2,More a collection of quotes than a compilation of ideas,"May be the title of this review seems odd or even sarcastic. However, I am obliged to deter potential readers, especially those who had read over three self help books, from picking this, which, is badly written, disorganised, with too high a proportion of quotes from Winston Churchill and Henry Ford. The minister background of the author just cant help. In short, please give this a pass."
2,"Interesting, but...","I love musicals, have seen my fair share of them, and appreciate a great deal of different styles -- from the challenging and rewarding Sondheim to the shmaltzy old favorites. Side Show has inspired a great deal of adulation from fans who seem to think it's the best musical in the history of western theater. It's not. The lyrics are surprisingly clumsy and at times lazy (some elements sound translated from another language!), the music has a passé bounce to it. Some of the vocal performances are very good (indeed Ripley & Skinner have a cult following) -- and I do commend all involved for trying to entertain with something different. I don't think it stands up to an earlier Off-Broadway musical that also dealt with the Hilton Sisters, 20 Fingers 20 Toes -- albeit in a darker and funnier tone, not unlike Little Shop of Horrors. This is not a ""top drawer, must have"" musical. It's more like, if you'll forgive the comparison, an interesting oddity to add to a larger collection."
2,Not impressed by the singing,"While I enjoy the music as well as the story, I was bothered by the scream-singing that seemed to be a part of the last verse of so many of the songs. An example is Who Will Love Me as I am. I really like this song, but on this recording it is ruined in the last verse by all the overdone belting. In my book, just being able to be LOUD and doesn't make you a good singer - in fact it kind of hurt my ears sometimes. On so many songs, it seemed to me that the singers had been instructed to blow out their vocal cords at the ends of songs, not to add to the emotion, but just ""because that's what you do"". This totally ruined perfectly good songs for me, because this belting seemed to come from nowhere, like it was just thrown in because those involved felt it was what an audience wanted to hear. The resulting sound kind of made me feel like I was listening to a Forbidden Broadway CD that was making fun of this type of vocal use in musicals."
5,Brilliant!,"Everyone who loves musicals needs to own Side Show. Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner are brilliant. I get chills everytime I listen to this CD. Who Will Love Me as I am, and I Will Never Leave You are two gorgeous ballads. Norm Lewis also shines as Jake, and You Should Be Loved goes in my book as one of the best songs from a musical. This show is filled with incredible songs and talent. You won't be disappointed."
2,What Price Mediocrity,"Maybe I've heard too many great lyrics by Johnny Mercer, Cole Porter, Noel Coward, Larry Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, Alan Jay Lerner etc, but recent shows (recent meaning the last 25 years or so, leave me slightly uncomfortable hearing cliche lyrics, bland melodies, phony operetta vibratos and just plain boring songs, or attempts to be clever and being obvious, OR dull ballads meant to be heartfelt. And YES I am under 40, no I'm not gay, and YES I applaud the idea of doing a weird musical concept, I just wish the creators had been as talented as the concept was original..."
2,Some Good Songs but I'd Recommend Other Musicals,"Ok, I bought the CD because I heard a great song from this musical, ""Feelings You've Got to Hide"" (it wasn't even that good after listening to it again.) There were both positives to the CD and negatives. First the postivies: Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner have amazing voices and there are some great songs such as ""I will Never Leave You"". Now the negatives: the show did not live up to the potential it had. The two lead girls did not use the power in their voice that I would have like to have heard. The two lead males did not have the best voices (that is my personal opinion) as well. The lyrics were not that good and the story seemed forced. Other than a few good songs the musical was not that good and just was not the type of musical I enjoy. I would recommend musicals such as Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, Avenue Q, etc. or musicals that has more than 7 songs you enjoy. There are good musicals but this just isn't one of them."
1,"CRAP, CRAP and CRAP again","God! This show really sucks, it sucks so badly I nearly threw up. The reason I gave it one star was because I couldn't give it zero. Do not waste your money. TITANIC: The Musical is more enjoyable than this crap, and TITANIC was really bad also."
5,Two New Broadway Stars Lead The Way In This Un-Known Classic,"Never before in American musical theater has a show with such emotional depth and integrity been performed by two of the most stage commanding and heart-warming performers ever. Alice Riply and Emily Skinner have taken ""Side Show"" and made it their own. Each rip roaring rock ballad is belted out by two of the most powerful and flexible voices I've ever heard on Broadway. Krieger has composed a gem. Each musical moment is timeless and unmistakably rich in musical texture and genius. ""Side Show"" is possibly the best written original score in Broadway history."
5,Excellent Quality,I actually bought this about two years ago to replace a the broken head of my tripod. I've been on numerous trips since then and have used it extensively. It is still in perfect condition and none of the joints have loosened. Definitely recommended.
5,amazing stuff,"i usually buy these 4 or 5 at a time. it isn't the same as the 'burt's bees outdoor blemish stick.' that one isn't as strong. the dr. burt's stick is fantastic! i break out often, so i go through these alot, but the blemishes are gone within a day or two, instead of a week."
3,Really Small,nice quality but the size is really small. I feel the blood stops flowing in my arm. So I think this is a children size.
4,Beautiful sword,"Beautiful sword for watching Game of Thrones with. Much lighter than I expected, the blade is necessarily thinner than some of the other licensed LOTR swords that I own, but that is understandable given that is a one handed sword with an unusually wide blade. A STEAL at 99$."
4,found it!,"I can't believe Eric Serra would not include the ""Taxi Cab Chase Scene"" music of Alech Tradi on the 5th Element soundtrack. That's just as well. When I found the song on N'ssi N'ssi, I discovered a whole new sound I absolutely fell in love with. Khaled has become a new favorite for me, and I look forward to hearing his other albums."
1,An embarassment to LDS Cinema,"This movie was simply awful. Apparently most others concur(including the producers), since I've heard no news of the sequels. Most members I talk to haven't even seen it. The acting, set, costumes, and especially script were enough to make anyone cringe. In fact, I'm surprised a movie this bad ever made it to distribution. The book is much, much better."
2,WORTH WATCHING IF YOU ARE BORD,"I have read the book and watched the film. I have to say as bad as the film was, it was far better than the book. If you are ued to read 16th century english, you might enjoy reading the book. I don't. Well the film can give you an overal view of such a boring read. Save yourself hours of hard and boring reading and watch the film."
1,Embarassing,"This movie was simply awful. Apparently most others concur(including the producers), since I've heard no news of the sequels. Most members I talk to haven't even seen it. The acting, set, costumes, and especially script were enough to make anyone cringe. In fact, I'm surprised a movie this bad ever made it to distribution. It should be noted that the church had nothing to do with the production of this movie. Those curious about the Book of Mormon should read the book."
1,you can judge a movie by its title,"What kind of moron gives such a stupid name to a movie. The epic trilogy ""star wars"" wasn't named ""An historical overview of the Galactic Empire vs. the Rebel forces: Volume 1 The Force."" ""Cast Away"" wasn't named ""man on stranded island."" ""National Treasure"" wasn't named ""The hunt for the secret mythological map."""
2,"Better than the book, but still sucks","This is that rare case where the film is actually better than the book. Where the book fulfilled the awkward task of being both rediculous AND boring, this movie was just plain rediculous. It was still entertaining in a ""Plan 9 from outer space"" sort of way. If you want to see what your mormon neighbors are so excited about, but don't want to bore yourself to the point of slitting your wrists, avoid the book and see this film. Gary Rogers has captured Joseph Smith's vision about as well as one could expect, given the source material. I understand they are now coming out with a comic book version of the book of Mormon. Perhaps that will be the best medium for Joseph Smith's story."
5,OK,"I liked this very much. It was a dramatic telling of the story, but well done. Looking forward to part two."
4,The Book of Mormon Movie - Volume 1 The Journey,"I agree that the acting is poor, some of the scenes a little hoke, and gives the appearance of a low budget movie, yet this movie depicts an accuracy of a portion of the Book of Mormon, and could be of benefit to those that know little to nothing about the Book of Mormon. I would recommend it to those who would like to watch and learn a little more about the Book of Mormon and its principles taught."
4,Not a big budget film but......,"I have read the other reviews for this film and I can't begin to see how people that claim to be LDS can say it is an embarrassment. What you have to remember is that it is a low budget movie and did not have the budget of movies like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Just remember we are not perfect. I am LDS and I enjoyed this movie. It has humor and was definately serious. I think that if more movies are made they will just get better and better. Those of us should just be thankful that movies that have anything to do with our faith are being shown in theaters (I am also aware that there was ""poetic lisence"" takeken in this film and it says so before the films begins) so get a grip and don't be so uptight about it being a low budget film."
1,Can you give less than 1 star?,"This is hands down one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think they spent their entire budget on arial views of South America. It is not even good enough to be called ""so-bad-it's-good""; it's just plain bad. It is a shame because this is an awesome story, but the writer/director missed the boat on delivery. This film added to the decline of Mormon cinema. Of course shoddy acting, lack of continuity, odd scriptural interpretations and creative liberties did not help any. If I owned the rights to this film I would buy up all the copies and destroy them out of embarressment."
1,So bad it's entertaining,"Very cheap, not good acting. But if you want to laugh, it is pretty funny just by how bad it is. Does not stay to the book very well"
2,Please STOP,"Please STOP making religious movies if you do not have the budget to do a proper work of it. Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon are believed by millions around the world to be the Word of God. Making a movie on the Book of Mormon that is at the same time cheesy, unprofessionally acted, and very low budget, does not help the cause of educating the masses to the message of the Book. The Book of Mormon, deserves much better. Years ago, in the mid 60's a movie came out called the Bible. Although not perfect, the acting was great and the photography a delight to the eye. Please, in reverence to the Word of God, DO NOT and I repeat, DO NOT even try to make a movie based on the Bible or the Book of Mormon without a proper level of quality and a good budget. It would be much, much better to just stick to the written Word rather than making a mess of it through a very bad movie."
2,"Spiritual, but could have been so much better","Lehi's beard nice and trimmed? All the actors a bunch of white Utah Mormons who don't look anything like the people in the middle east? Language not even close to sounding archaic? Unfortunately I really thought and hopped it would be better. I love the Book of Mormon and I've read it many times, but this movie does not give it any justice. However being about the Book of Mormon, it was very spiritual. They definately could have used some help form Historians, Anthropoligist and Linguistics. Honestly I've seen better acting in High School plays. If they continue with more ""Voumes"" I sure hope that they can make it look a little more acurate. It would be nice to watch another one without grinding my teeth so much."
1,Worst movie ever,"This movie is the worst portrayal of the Book of Mormon ever. Bad acting along with a terrible script take away from what could have been a movie as great as ""The Ten Commandments"" -- Someone needs to remake this movie and fast before people think the Book of Mormon is this lame too. (By the way the Book of Mormon is worth reading)"
2,A movie can only be as good as its material....,"There are three reasons to watch this movie: You are either a devout Mormon, in which case you'll probably ignore all its shortcomings (and there are many) or you are curious as to what is in the Book of Mormon and can't get past the horrible writing in the book, or three (like me) you are into the camp factor.For the first and third, you will enjoy this movie. For the second, you'll leave confused and bewildered."
1,painfully bad,"Good golly, this is a bad film. Bad acting, bad costumes, bad idea. As an active LDS member, I knew the chance of this movie capturing the power of this wonderful book was slim, and so I tried to lower my expectations. I'm telling you, I couldn't get my expectations any lower - and it still disappointed. Wow. What an amazingly bad movie. I couldn not make it to the end, it was so bad.What we need is to leave the LDS-theme movies to Handcart and BYU studios where they belong. If you want to see a great LDS film depicting people of this era, go see 'Testaments' on your next visit to Salt Lake City. Now THAT was an incredible film."
5,Not just for kids,"I bought this book for my son. I picked it up one night and got hooked. Easy step by step instructions and you already have most of the supplies, paper, pencil and erasure. I recommend it to anyone at any age, no artistic talent required."
4,How it is all linked,"(!! This comment is based on the 7th edition !!)If you know your way around organisational theory, and if you were surprised by the straightforwardness of 'The One Minute Manager', than this may be your next best buy.The authors not only bring together several theories, but they also explore how they are linked, and what they mean in practice (after all, they are behaviorists).If you are looking for a more theoretical underpinning of 'why the story of The One Minute Manager is so true!', you may find the answers in this book."
2,"Required, but medium quality","This was not the worst textbook I've had to read for a course, but it not the best either. It's not a book to read for fun, but it does contain some useful information."
2,Management of Organizational Behavior,Not too bad as these books go but a tremendous amount of verbiage explaining the obvious. Excellent example of turning simple concepts in complex charts and definitions. I would imagine that people in the field love this hyperbole but it's BS to me and pretty much a waste of time to drudge though all of it.
2,"Good info, bad questions","When a GRE prep book has incorrect answers, it does not help very much. Also, the questions were not like the ones on the actual test. They were harder and used concepts ETS did not put on the actual GRE. If not for the ""hints"" in the text section of the book, I would say it was a waste of time."
4,"Nice, suprising low light ability","I also own a the Steiner Ralleye 7x50's, which I like a little more and seem to be a bit more robust. The 9x40's have the same styling as their military type brothers, but they are smaller and lighter. The optics are very clear and suprisingly, at least to me, the low light performance of the Safari 9x40 model is actually much better then I anticipated. If I had to carry a pair all day, the 9x40's would probaly be my choice. Out of a car or boat, I'd chose the heavier models as they seem a little more built for abuse then these."
5,Relaxing,An excellent compilation of Mancini's works. Great for just laying around and musing or doing small things around the house.
2,Not Real Smead Brand,"I bought this item previously in July 2012, and received the Smead brand in a proper box. I re-ordered them again this month, and was shipped a box of generic folders that has no Smead company printing on it. They will be adequate for my purposes, and I won't ship them back. However, I think it is false advertising to say you are selling Smead brand, then ship a cheaper, no-name brand product. I saved about $4.00 per box of 100 over the Office Depot near me, but I will likely buy them locally from now on."
1,Prince Charles the Anti-Christ?,"Picture Prince Charles in jackboots, flying around in a black helicopter. Imagine him as the Anti-Christ. Well, that's basically what the author says in this poorly written, poorly published book. The author further describes how conservation of environment will eventually lead to the collapse of the US Constitution and sovereignty of all nations. Little did I know that by asking the hotel I am staying not to change the linens everyday, I was actually accelerating anarchy and the evetual establishment of the evil ""World Governance"" There's even a comparison list between Prince Charles and Jesus, which the author included in the book to prove...nothing. The only reason I read the book is that I live overseas and don't want to pay for return postage. Go watch X-files: its far more convincing."
3,Interesting>>>,"According to Nostradamus, the anti-Christ will come from the Far East and wear a blue turban. He calls him Mabus which in the mirror spells Sudam. I believe Charles has a lot of power behind him, and I expect anything of all the crazy people that lead this world. The Bible says that in the last days, there will be wickedness, and there is, so look out!! We are going to go out in a ball of fire."
1,Get something with multi media writing formats,"I bought this unit without checking what media it accepts. It only writes to DVD-R/DVD-RW. It just so happen that my house is full of DVD+R...so i had to go purchase it. Then I set it up to my set top box and for some reason I couldn't get it to record. It might be user error, but it was all very confusing, so I ended up returning the unit."
5,Great Watch,"I'm very pleased with this new Tissot, purchased through Amazon. Arrived on time, and as described. The photos do not do the watch justice, a beautiful piece. It came with all of the original packaging, I'm quite confident this is not a knockoff. It's early yet, but for the first week, it keeps perfect time, has not lost a second to the atomic clock. The band is definitely leather, and easy to put on and take off, once you get used to the clasp system (be sure to open both sides of it). My wrist is about 8.5 inches around, and I am using the middle of the 8 notches on the band. I've already received compliments on the watch, and like the way it looks on my wrist. I feel the 300.00 saved over purchasing direct from Tissot or a jewelry store more than compensates for the warranty being provided through Amazon instead of the manufacturer. The amazon warranty is two years, same as the manufacturer, though it only covers the watch itself, not the band. You can't go wrong with this purchase."
5,&#24456;&#19981;&#38169; &#25105;&#21916;&#27426;,&#24320; &#22987; &#30382; &#24102; &#20250; &#26377; &#28857; &#32039;&#65292; &#36719; &#19979; &#26469; &#20043; &#21518; &#23601; &#22909; &#20102;&#12290; &#22806; &#24418; &#24456; &#28385; &#24847; &#12290;I like it.
2,too short,Although the watch is good but I had to return it since the strap was bit complex and way too small.Its definitely not mens size.
2,Great watch; lousy band and warranty,"I have had this watch just over 2 months. I really like it. If I could remake it, i would make the case a little thinner. However, the clasp on the band has broken twice. Of course, the band and clasp are not covered by Amazon's warranty so I am out of luck. You take chances when you buy gray market merchandise, and Amazon burned me on this one. It is my first bad experience with Amazon in years."
5,"Great watch, elegant AND sporty how could you go wrong","This piece is hands down one of the best looking Tissots. I have fairly small wrists but the strap is adjustable over a fairly large range. The clasp is a little difficult to deal with, but is easy to get used to. This white face brown leather strap is my favorite color combination but the black on black looks fantastic as well, with the yellow chrono hands. This watch looks better in person than in any picture. I hadn't expected the case to be so shiny but its really an eye catcher, as I have already gotten compliments for it the second day I've owned the watch. Might consider buying a gator strap for this baby too, but overall great watch. Its got a nice heft to it but not too much, and the screw down crown is a beautiful touch. Bought this to be my daily wearer as it compliments both the jeans/white tee or formal look."
5,Amazing price for the luxury watch like Tissot!,"I am very pleased with my purchase. Tissot makes me a big suprise with prc 200 sport type. Moreover, I am also interested in the case outside. Its look attractive and creative. However, a question from me is that why Tissot do not put inside in case as direction book to adjust the date ans set up time zone for Prc. I make confusing about adjusting it. Can anybody help me? Thank you very much!"
2,Disappointed,"The watch was received on time. And it's was a great brand new TISSOT watch. However, I was quite disappointed that the watchband color didn't match the picture.I was expecting black (exactly as the picture), and instead I received a brown one."
2,Beware of crappy watches,"I got this watch two weeks back from Amazon and within two days, it stopped working. The minute and hour hands would rotate as I turn the watch. Returned this and decided never to go for Tissot again."
3,Broken clasp,"Retured my prc200 the same day i got it. On taking it out of the box and trying it on for the first time the little pin in the clasp that goes through the holes on the band fell out. I may give then another chance later in time but for the moment i refunded the watch and bought a Victorinox classic chrono.Now about the look of the watch, it was amazing. The face is so clear the watch really did looked like million bucks. The band was nice and thickly padded. But the defective clasp led me away from tissot for the moment."
2,not as good as expected,"I bought it for my friend, it looked good. But after 1 month, some screw is not very tight and got lost~ The quality is confusing with the price."
2,A bit disappointed,"I have a Tissot my father gave me back in the seventies. It still runs today and I wear it as often as any of my watches. The Sport PRC200 model was disappointing because I could not get the pointers to fully zero when resetting the chronometer. And there was no trick to adjust this particular issue.I noted that the box I received came from the Amazon ""return center"", not the ""fulfillment"" location I normally see from Amazon. I can guess from this that this was a restock item and may have been returned from a prior customer without them specifying a defect - so it was put back into inventory...anyway that is only speculation.I was not happy with this particular item, but Amazon makes it easy to return merchandise and so I returned this one and got a different brand."
5,elegant,"the word (elegant) describes this watch precisely!the brown leather, the design. Its just perfect!i really love it !"
2,Not for House Heads,"A couple of actual classics but overall this is a weak representation of House, a flow, a grove that makes you wanna Dance."
4,Pleasing to the Ear,My girlfriend is a huge house music fan. By huge I mean she can listen to it for hours and drift away. When she got this CD I could hear her scream in joy. She hasn't stopped listening to it yet.
1,Not what I thought it would be,I'm a huge house and club classic fan. This cd had a lot of songs I wanted but they were mixed/re-mixed. Not too happy with the purchase. The shipper was great though!!!
4,BACK IN THE DAY HOUSE!!,"TOOK ME BACK TO MY GARAGE DAYS W/ LARRY LEVAN. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. JUST WISH THIS CD AS MIXED."
5,WHat I wanted but couldn't find in stores,"This was the same brand I looked at in Pepboys, but they didn't have a set of 5, only sets of 4. With shipping this set of 5 cost the same as I would have paid for the set of 4 in the store. Quality appears good, only time will tell."
2,Strange Music's Worst CD,"Wow! I was completely surprised on how boring this CD was. Do not buy this, instead, get Kutt Calhoun's new mixtape called ""Flamez Mix-Tape"", or wait for ""Feature Presentation"". B.L.E.V.E. is just too mediocre. I can't even name a stand-out track."
4,Trial Advocacy,"The book is well written. Every lawyer has their own style, so several of the ""techniques"" recommended in the book are criticized by practicing attorneys. The chapters are pretty broad, I believe the entire book is less than 10 chapters: picking a jury, opening statement, direct, cross, exhibits, closing statement, expert witnesses. The information is accurate but this book is not a how to."
2,Book Was Not New,The book I bought was advertised as new. It was not new. Some of the pages were already highlighted.
2,Too long for delivery.,"The product in itself is fine. However, It took almost a month for me to receive the book. When in the purchase reciept it said it would arrive within 7 to 10 business days. I bought other books through Amazon from private owners and I received those books 2 days after my purchase and I was still waiting for the book I ordered through amazon. I would think that Amazon would be more speedy with purchases."
2,Consider imports.,"The Starret combination square is too overpriced now. The Chinese are now producing bench tools that are of now somewhat high quality standards. The problem with the Starret combination square is not the materials, but the unadjustable play between the tools and the attaching steel rule. The slight play, such as with the center finder, leaves you with an inacurrate center location. This is not true with many of the import combination sqaures.The Environmental Protection Agency with the Clean Air Act has destroyed the Made in USA campaign. So, do not be at all afraid to buy import tools in many cases. After reveiwing the latest bench tools from China at a recent manufacturing trade convention, I decided to buy to buy an import combination square from China to replace the Starret for a price of about $45.00 US. No more slight play between the tool and the attaching steel rule."
3,Excellent book for beginner and intermediate users,"Great books for ssh beginner. The illustrations are great. The examples are clear but they are a bit unclear at times. The biggest disappointment is the missing debugging part. For most users, it's the steps that leading to the working environment are the parts that count. Personally, nothing's on the Internet is working ""out-of-the-box"", especially this ssh application. The coverage on ssh on Windows are very misleading and some parts are incorrect. I do not know if Mr Barrett or Mr Silverman have ever set up a sshd process on an Windows NT server or Windows 2000 server. Good luck to those who want to set up sshd server process on Windows NT/2000 machines !"
3,Decent Book,"Good book, but a little hard to understand. Considering the subject matter that is unavoidable. Part of the problem is due to UNIX/LINUX forks. By that I mean no two versions of UNIX/LINUX are exactly alike.This book is mostly for system administrators. However those of us below that level can glean a few nuggets of usefull information out of it."
5,Makes sense of the obscure land of SSH,"For something that should be simple SSH is anything but a walk in the park. This is compounded by the fact that the documentation for SSH just blows. This book, however, does everything but blow. In classic O'Reilly fashion the author decomposes the topic and covers it effectively from almost every angle with excellent writing and superb graphics. This is a great book for anyone who uses SSH, or who is having issues with it."
3,Slowly getting it,"Although not entirely difficult to follow, this book was useful after a little ssh hands-on."
2,The benefit of this SSH books was encrypted.,"Overall, I didn't like the book and I found it confusing since it described too many things at the same time. Thus, it seemed, the book didn't save me time and I had to search the web for further details, especially on the things that I wanted to do like using SSH commands."
1,I would give this zero stars if I could,My son loves lift the flap/pull the tab books so I thought this would be a good purchase for him. But the tabs are really hard to pull. I couldn't get some to move at all. He just gets frustrated with this book.
1,This book sunk,"Mr. Seal's novel, Treachery at Sharpnose Point, is best left unread. It is a waste of your time. The book takes a rather straightforward shipwreck in the mid 1800s and attempts, very hard, to make the case that something malicious was afoot. Despite a great many colorful adjectives, little proof is offered. To fancy up the story, Mr. Seal is instead forced to make up a fictional account of the events on the doomed vessel.This book never should have been written. Mr. Seal uncovers little, if any, mystery or intrigue. What he does manage to do is, however, rather atrocious. Mr. Seal spends most of the book maligning the name of RS Hawker, a long passed vicar who lived in the area of the shipwreck. He paints the vicar as a villian but on the weakest of evidence. Mr. Seal writes badly of the dead with no good cause and for that the book suffers.Avoid it."
4,enthralling historical speculative book,"While in the town of Morwenstow, author Jeremy Seal noticed the cracked figurehead of the Scottish ship Caledonia, which sunk off the English coast in 1842. Interested in learning more about the ill-fated vessel, Mr. Seal searched public records dating back to 1842, customs paperwork and local edifices like the church. Mr. Seal concludes that the townsfolk led by Parson Hawker caused wreck in order to salvage the cargo.When Mr. Seal examines the past through his mesmerizing theory, readers receive an enthralling historical speculative work. However, when Mr. Seal provides insight into how he conducts research and the steps he took to draw his conclusion, the book loses momentum. Though overall quite interesting, TREACHERY AT SHARPNOSE POINT could have been morbidly great with more insight into the 1842 Morwenstow Caledonia link and less Seal.Harriet Klausner"
3,Smuggling and Looting,"The book about about Sharpnose Point reminds me of the Alfred Hitchcock movie JAMAICA INN, starring Charles Laughton, about ships being sent to their watery graves by a gang of piratical smugglers. I read of this sort of thing after reading of the looting of money chests, etc, of the 1860 USM Lady Elgin, a US Army supply and federal mail ship, sunk by ramming near Winnetka Illinois."
3,Good basics and easy to follow examples,There are some great ideas and basics in this book. It would be easier to imagine the end product if they didn't use such ugly fabrics in the examples.
3,Service was great but product is not what I expected,"Everything in the ordering and receiving process was great, but the product was not great. Nice smell but it stings when you put it on."
5,Joe Jackson's best yet,"I first heard this disc as background music while doing something else; I found it difficult to get into and not very enjoyable. On a solo car trip a few months later, I gave it a more serious listen and was pleasantly surprised to find that I was wrong. The orchestration is original, the music is eclectic, the lyrics are delightful and thoughtful, and the overall effect is impossible to pigeonhole. I've liked all Joe Jackson's previous albums, and I hope this one represents a change in direction because I love it and want to hear more in this vein."
4,Worth the challenge,"If a person is only familiar with the pop sounds of Joe Jackson, then they better open up their minds. With Jackson's classical training, he finally gets a chance to stretch his legs into a unique sound that is not quite classical, not quite jazz, and not quite rock. This work is a strong musical interpretation of the 7 deadly sins. 'Angel' and 'The Bridge' are slow and easy to listen to. 'A Bud and a Slice' is hilarious and has beautiful orchestration, as do the other songs. 'Anger' is a challenging bombastic sound of two drummers and an angry ...um...young?... man. I say listen to it 3 times, then make your decision. I think its worth every penny."
2,It's ok,"I think the music is ok. I would not call Joe Jackson a genuis. Sounds like a musical and he just put it together in his own way. The best and my personal favorite is SLOTH with guest singer Brad Robert from the Crash Test Dummies. Awsome song. But Joe Jackson ruins it by singing in it. He is winey and irratating. But for $1.50 I got it for, is worth the buy for one song."
5,dp,"I think this album is dope!! yes, it's kind of 311, but much more energy with tough guy lyrics...the best description i could give is, POD meets Bad Brains style reggae with just enough Janes Addiction guitar sounds to give you all the elements you need to know what So Cal is all about!!!This is a good albums for girls, and a good album for guys because we all like to get drunk sometimes...Props to the Mix Mob for making a great record!! It's to be expected on Suburban Noize!!!-dp-"
2,I wouldn't buy it!,"The Russian alphabet is different and this book does a really good job of teaching it, but you really need a cassette to help you pronounce the words."
2,Be careful of mistakes,"I thought this book was pretty good to begin with, but it seemed to get worse as it went along. The vocabulary and teaching methods in the later lessons were lacking, and the book is chock full of simple editing mistakes, such as mistaking 120 for 200 (Unit 14, Key Words #1)... such mistakes can really throw you off when learning... this book might be okay for the casual language learner for travel, but overall pretty mediocre.I would recommend Penguin's ""Russian Course"" by Nichholas J. Brown and Oxford's ""Russian Grammar & Verbs"". Both are much more attuned to serious language learners."
4,Beginner's Russian,I use this textbook a lot teaching Russian. It has all the basic things you need to know to learn convers.Russian.
2,PAS D'ORIGINAL,"In his career, Gainsbourg sampled many different styles (and women... which inspired the career in part)... and he almost always came off sounding fresh and original, but this collection of his music from the 1970s comes off very stale... very dated and all sounding the same. There are only a few really pleasant songs here (""La Decadanse"", ""Sex Shop"", ""Je Suis Venu Te Dire Que Je M'En Vais"" and perhaps ""Vu De L'Exterieur""). This collection is not at all inspiring, and it would definitely be a better investment to buy Gainsbourg's earlier works, which will give you a more vibrant picture of his inimitable talent and originality. This collection is not a pillar of originality."
1,"John Beck""s Kit is a Rip Off","We just ordered this kit and was very disappointed.I wish I came to Amazon and read the reviews.We are sending it back.I agree with the other person,its a big rip off.The websites don""t exist,they want you to buy more books & cd's.I hope this will help other people,please read the reviews first.I don't want to give this guy any ratings,but to get my review in I have too."
5,A collaboration of music skill and imagination,"I am a classical music collector finding myself being intrigued with the invention of ways to bring classical music to today's audiences. Karl Jenkins is a thoroughly trained classical composer with an ear toward tomorrow. With his tasteful use of electronic overdubs,and his wonderful, sensitive knowledge of early and modern music, he has put together a marvelous stepping stone from Khachaturian into the world of Enya and ethnic genres. It's a wonderful discovery. Try it! You'll LOVE it!"
5,Beautiful Music,This CD is the best of two different Musical Types. The orchestrtion and the choral components are wonderfully matched. When you listen to this you can go on a journey that is so magical!
5,Fantastic,"I'm probably Karl Jenkins' largest fan, and he doesn't even know it. I find myself directing a faux choir/orchestra during his music. Yeah, I get weird looks on the plane, but I don't care!"
4,It's been so long!,"I learned about this music when I was in high school. Our music teacher selected a piece for us to sing at the annual Christmas concert. I liked it so much that she made me a copy of the CD. However, the copy didn't last long and I've been missing it since it stopped working years ago. I finally bought and love it, as I knew I would!"
4,Adiemus II,"Overall, I think this is the best of the Adiemus works. The symphonic overtones add greatly to the richness of the songs."
4,Enchanting,"The CD consists of several long movements ""Cantus""'s and several shorter ""Chorale"" movements primarily showcasing Miriam Stockleys mesmerizing voice. Beautiful, original, and haunting music."
4,This CD like it's predecessor is an absolute keeper !.,"Since hearing Jenkins' music I've been a fan. Jenkins, Stockley and the London Philharmonic Orchestra could not be anything but a winning team. The haunting music just sends shivers down my spine. Being a Brit myself, I'm rather proud of my countrymen."
4,My least favorite Adiemus CD,"I was spell bound by Adiemus 1 - Songs of Sanctuary. For quite some time it was the CD that I listened to the most. I was disappointed with Adiemus 2 -- felt that the orchestra distracted from the vocals. The sound was more ""western/european/american"" than the first. I have purchased all of the Adiemus CDs - and would rank them in the following order (most favorite first): Best of/#1 (tie), #3, #2.I often give these CDs as gifts, and I've stockpiled #1 and the ""Best of"" whenever I've found them on sale.Although #2 is good, it pales in comparison to the others."
2,I might have enjoyed it,I had to return the cd because it was defective. The vendor sent an opened product which was obvious it was previously used. I think I would have liked the cd had it worked.
2,"Good, but....","This DVD had gotten good reviews elsewhere so was excited about it. We were planning on showing it in my husband's pediatric office but there is one problem. It divides the animals into categories, like carnivores..but God did not originally make animals to be meat eaters. Thought it would be too confusing."
1,Similac,I am very DISSATISFIED! I never received this product and it took over 3 wks to get a response from the seller and to get my money back...They claimed something was wrong with their email....they shouldn't sell a product if they can't deliver or get there email to work...I bought this formula as a gift for my Grand Nephew because he is alergic to everything else! But as you know I never received it! Elizabeth Hardy
5,High Quality Leather Case,"I bought this case for my treo from Sena's web site. It arrived quickly in a nice packaging. The actual item comes in a nice box which has a professional look. The case fits tightly to the device and does not look awkward as some other cases do. It does not come into your way when you are trying to type something. The workmanship was definately higher than my expectations. They also offered a belt clip. At the time I thought it was useless. But after carrying it in my pocket for several weeks, now I think it would be better to get it.All in all I like it very much and definately recommend."
3,Functionality,"Nice looking case, but magnets in the cover flap are too weak to hold the cover in place--as a consequence the cover flap falls down when case is secured to belt--awkward and inconsistent with intended function. Belt clip does not keep phone in desired position--phone will change orientation depending upon body movement. One can do better for less."
5,Wonderful treat,This was a great little treat for my nephew on his Christening day. It provided something small and special that he can put away either for his wedding or for future children. A great new tradition that doesn't take up to much space!
4,Father's Day Gift,"Got these for my dad who has a lot of pain in his feet and he says they feel great. A little pricey, but you get what you paid for."
4,The Sisters of Peerbaugh Place Are Back!,"A Place to Belong is the 4th and final installment in the Sister Circle Series. The reader again meets Evelyn, Mae, Audra, Summer, and all the other past and present women of Peerbaugh Place. This time, Evelyn has let in a whole new lot of women, none of whom can pay her rent! A sister has problems with her children, another sister considers having an affair, and yet another struggles to come to terms with her adoption. The authors finish this wonderful series with their most real and heartwarming story yet. It is always sad to see a great series end, but each sister's story is completed with class and the real life touch that makes the Sister Circle Series unique."
5,My son looks great in this!,Good quality outfit that I bought for my son. I always get a big kick out of this outfit when my wife puts him in it! Go Heels!
2,poorly labeled,Brackets were linked to the running boards I bought but are not the correct ones for my vehicle.They did show up in three days without paying for expedited shipping.
1,BEWARE,"If I could, I wouldn't give a single star. Don't be a fool--this could be considered commercial cheating. In fact, the bonus CD has nothing to do with Diana Ross at all! And the person who wrote the liner notes was even intelligent enough not to sign. There's much better than this; this is going very low."
1,Where Did Our Ross Go?,"When I buy a Diana Ross CD, I expect to hear Diana Ross. Not Diana Ross & the Supremes or The Supremes after Diana Ross after leaving the Supremes. Especially since only Diana's photo is on the cover.Track 1-19 is Diana Ross & The Supremes Track 37-42 is the Supremes after Diana Ross left the Supremes. So really only Track 20-36 is Diana Ross, 17 songs. Now really Universal Records someone there is not doing their homework.You should hire me, I know I could do a better job with the entire Motown Catalog. In fact I have suggested songs that you have included recently. Case in point ""To Love Again"" ""Never Say I Don't Love You"" ""You Were The One"" and others."
5,"Once again, Max and Ruby RULE!!!","Just as with all the other Max and Ruby dvds, this one is over the top with fun, charm, and whimsy. My grandchildren love The Blue Tarantula in this dvd, but the entire dvd is chock full of seasonal fun. Watching this dvd makes us feel like fall is just a breath away. It also includes Max and Ruby's Thanksgiving which is positively delightful. Any Max and Ruby fan cannot miss adding this to their collection. Wonderful!"
5,enjoyed,enjoyed this with my 3 yr old grandson. He likes max and ruby so this was fun for us. The stories are short so thats great.
5,Elmo's world,"My 10 month old little princes just loves Elmo, and i love him too because it buys me time when ever i need to get stuff done arroung the house :O)"
1,Thumbs Down,My daughter loves Elmo and I was dissappointed that it had to show 2 gay dads with a child in the families section. I don't like the way they try to force and use subliminal messages on small children. That goes to show why you have to screen movies before you let your children watch them.
1,Don't kid yourself!,"About Louis Bailey's comment- This video is about Families, not friends. Two men with a child, being two buddies waiting in the park for their wives, just doesn't make sense. Think about it!"
5,Great DVD,"My grandson especially likes the bath segment in this DVD, but watches almost the entire video. He's 15 months old & dearly loves Elmo. Very happy with my purchase!"
5,Great Dvd!,"My 1 and 3 year old LOVE this DVD! We literally watch it every single day. I need to buy a few more so we can switch it up. I love these DVD's too. Not only is it Elmo, but the way it teaches things, its so creative and fun! I actually enjoy watching as well! Yay for Elmo!!"
5,Love it,I love the song Tell Me. Even though this CD has been out for a long time. I heard it recently and love it. I will defiantly buy the CD.
1,Exhaust tip did not fit- bracket is too small size,"The exhaust tip bracket came the wrong size, it is much smaller than it says in the description. My car has 1-3/4"" tailpipe opening, I had to struggle very hard for an hour or two try to get it in. The bracket is all bent out of shape. They should have provided with a larger bracket so that it would fit the sizes that they mentioned in the product description. I am not happy with this product."
4,Does NOT fit my 08 Passat 2.0,"Bought 2 of these after reading the reviews here and on a forum and they don't fit my 2008 Vw passat. I tried very hard but they just don't fit. Product looks nice so i gave it a 4 star but if you are going to buy it for your Passat, don't because does not fit. My Passat has the Tsi engine but i don't know if the tail pipes are any different on the Fsi engines."
5,For 07 passat recomended by member on vwvortex,b6passat member on vw vortex recommended these tips. They fit like a sock and look great on the passat. Way better than the non polished tips on the car now. The lip is rounded and gives it that factory look. Well worth the $9.XX per tip.
5,'07 Passat Wagon,At first it did not look like it would fit. With a little bit of wiggle and pressure it fits right on and it is a perfect fit! Best upgrade investment I made in a long time. You won't go wrong with this purchase.
1,Don't Fit 2007 VW Passat,I bought 2 tips to put on my 2007 VW Passat 2.0T but they do not even come close to fitting. I was hoping they would slip right on but they are not big enough. Luckily they were cheap to buy so I'm not that upset. I just wish they would of fit. Now I'm still on the hunt for tips that don't break the bank. Be careful before you buy.
1,Stripped,"I just bought this to put on my 91 honda civic hatch, and my exhaust is a 1-1/2"" inlet and this bracket inside the tip is to small, and when i tried tightening the screws on it they were stripped therefore i gave up because when driving around it loosens and rattles, dont waaste your time on this, yeah the price is ood, but not for what you get."
3,Good Movie,"I am a Harrison Ford fan and enjoy his movies. This is not his greatest movie, but it is a good one."
4,Where do Teddy Bears come from?,"This is a really cute and entertaining video. My 4 year-old really enjoys it and is facintated by the details of how a teddy bear is designed and constructed. He loves all the characters and has been spotted examining his teddy bears for how they were put together. On a recent trip to San Diego, we were able to follow up with a trip to the Teddy Bear Factory shop in Old Town. My son was able to pick out a style of bear and help stuff, close, fluff etc. He had a blast and continues to enjoy the video."
1,Good until both mats split,"I live in the desert and my dogs needed an escape from the heat, even indoors. I bought two pads at a great price, and the dogs loved them. They would lie on them all the time, and they seemed to help them cool off. However, after only two months, both mats split in similar places near the seams. It certainly seems like a design defect. I was immensely disappointed, and not interested in shipping them back for the warranty as the cost to ship was not worth it. Would have been happy if they had actually survived more than two months (I also had the pad that was actually rated for more than my dogs' weight.)On a good note, the Amazon associated store did a great job in getting them out to me in only two days when I paid for standard shiping."
3,"OK, but No Magic Here","I rated it 3 stars, because it is cooler than say vinyl flooring, but it doesn't offer that much relief. If you want to get an idea of what it's like, put a piece of 1 inch foam in a zip lock bag and saturate the foam with water. Close the bag and lay it on the floor. That's basically what the bed is. It is cooler than other surfaces, but my dogs gave it a mediocre response. They would rather lay on the tile or laminate floor.I would shop around. I got mine out-of-season on clearance at a pet store chain."
4,Canine Cooler Mat,This product really works! Every time I checked the crate pads during the last dog show we went to they were comfortably cool. Well worth the expense for dogs that you're sure won't chew them up.
2,Design Flaw.,"Living in Arizona, staying cool is a big concern of mine. Not just for me, but for my pug. I was SO excited when I discovered the ""Canine Cooler"" and even more so when I saw how much my pug enjoyed it. The Canine Cooler worked great for approximately 2 years until one day it ripped...ALONG THE SEAM! I was SO disappointed, as was my pug, and to make matters worse, I am NOT the only person this has happened to. So, you may want to re-consider before spending your hard-earned money on a product with a design flaw."
2,Doesn't stay as cool as advertised,"Mat does not work as well as I would have liked. I purchased it primarily for outdoor use for our lab who has cushings disease. The advertisement said that as long as the mat remained in the shade it would stay cool. It stayed under our carport, completely shaded, but was no cooler than the actual concrete."
4,Canine Cooler - Seams burst within a year+,"At just about 1.5 years, the seams split on my canine cooler. My dog loves it, so I have no choice but to replace it. At 16 yrs old, he overheats often - year round. It was never abused.The canine cooler also works great for humans --better than the Soothsoft's human counterpart, Chillow. Chillow is similar to the lower quality of plastic covering, used for the dog cooling bed made by Cool Bed II for $20 less.The Soothsoft company now only warrants it for 1 year. If you didn't buy it directly from them, you have to deal with whomever you purchased it and be subjected to their return policies. The company charges a minimum of $15 to handle a returned replacement.Check around online - you can order a small canine cooler for $40-$45, S&H; included or free. Takes the pain out of replacing this defective seam issue every year or two."
4,My dogs love it but the seams don't last,I have bought 2 of these now and my dogs love them!!! Unfortunately it is always just a matter of time until the seams go. My first one lasted less than a year until an unfortunate puppy pounce ended its life (seams burst). The second one had been in the shade of a patio unmoved for months when one day it just gave in two locations. I am looking to buy a replacement as the dogs love it so muh that they keep laying on the deflated one dejectedly but I need something with better quality as these are not cheap (I get the large size).
2,How accurate is this opus?,"After reading several obvious mistakes in dates and in the spelling of important names, I am wondering how much of this biography is fact and how much is made up for dramatic effect.The date of Kennedy's assasination was not November 23, it was the 22nd. Melvyn Douglas is spelled ""Melvin"" here, and the Watts riots were not in 1964, they were a year later.... I remember it well. I read many more mistakes before I was through. Did this author check his facts? Did the publisher care? How much more of the life of this incredible man is incorrect?The book is not compelling, even though the subject of Mr. Darin an amazing one. I am hoping another author will tackle this mans life and give it the justice it deserves. This reads more like an expose rather than a serious biography."
2,Nothing But Quotes,"Roman Candle paints a jerky, unfocused picture of Bobby Darin. The author's prolific use of quotes, with speakers using different verb tenses than the narrator and different than each other, make the book a chore to read instead of a joy. If all the quotes were removed, the book would be less than 40 pages.Bobby Darin's short, frenetic life, filled with brillance and shadows, is fascinating ... but not as told by this author. I recommend you chose another book."
2,Cheap summer read on Darin,"This book was so cheaply constructed that it literally fell apart before I was able to finish reading it. My copy has pages falling out due to the poor condition of the binding. The writing style is disjointed making it difficult to read at times and to keep track of who is actually speaking. Some of the information is interesting if not salacious and for some people quite self serving, but I still wonder how accurate allot of this stuff is when people are being quoted some 30+ years later. Also, there are just so many annoying typos and mistakes in names and dates that one wonders about the accuracy of the rest of the content and if this expose wasn't just thrown together in a hurry to coincide with the movie bio that came out a couple of years ago. If you're a Bobby Darin fan as I am you may have to read everything you can get on him but this bio reads more like a gossip column than a biography."
5,DAVID EVANIER DOES IT AGAIN,"You heard me...David Evanier has the gift of giving us the in-depth stories of the people we want to know more about. I was so impressed by Bobby Darin's story, who he was, where he came from, and what he accomplished in such a short time. David Evanier's dedication to his subject does not go unnoticed either, He puts you in the life of Bobby Darin as he did with Jimmy Rosselli and Joe Pantoliano. My suggestion is to read Roman Candle, go see ""Beyond the Sea"" with Kevin Spacey, and read the book one more time..Oh Yeah...get the Soundtrack from the movie as well....YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED BY ANY MEANS!! 5 Stars is not enough."
2,cute but not worth buying,"my daughter recieved this toy for christmas and loved it until bedtime, when you take it off demo mode it seems like blue will never stop singing and talking, turning it off is an option but my daughter gets agrivated when she presses the moon and nothing happens. after the first night she hasn't wanted to sleep with it, she will play with it durring the day but only on demo mode so she can just press the moon when she wants to hear blue talk or sing and not go on and on and on."
4,Now our third purchase,"We use this olive oil for cooking daily. However, when we run out of the more flavorful specialized olive oil that we use daily in salad dressings and a ""finishing oil"" this one is still so much better than the more common olive oils in the store. AND per ounce is significantly less expensive per ounce than all the oils in the local food store and way better quality than can be found in ""big box"" stores. Now that they are packaging it better for shipping we're completely satisfied. First shipment great. Second shipment no packaging material used in box and can was dented. We immediately poured it all out into a large plastic pitcher. Oil was fine, can did not leak, but not the point. Tried 1 more time and yesterday it came in packaged well and can in good condition. Don't be concerned about quantity, I had 1 instance when about 1/2 can of this oil ended up in the cabinet for 6 months and it was just fine, probably could have gone a year."
5,Olive Oil Preview,Good product. Good price. Excellent value. What else can you say about olive oil. Cold pressed is the thing you look for when you buy it.
4,Good bulk olive oil,"This has a nice round flavor with an herbal hint in the background. The label says it is a blend containing oil from Italy, Spain, Greece and Tunisia. It works very well for sauces and sauteeing. It is at least as good as any oil in its category that I have tried.Unfortunately the can arrived somewhat banged about with a dented side and dented top. The product would travel better by mail if it were packaged in a plastic jug."
2,Low on flavor oil,"We bought a gallon of this oil, because the market had a promotion($16.50 per gallon). My wife disliked it immediately, saying it lacked any real flavor. After a taste test, I had to agree. Olive oil has so much flavor, easily recognized by even a young tongue. The other 2 olive oils in our house were brimming with more olive flavor. So now we use the Genco only for cooking, and use it sparingly. When real flavor is called for, we use the other brands. Take your own taste test; you might be surprised. To be fair, maybe we got a batch of Genco that was ""off"" a bit. I imagine olive oil producers are subject to the whims of nature, and maybe our gallon was from a less than stellar harvest of olives.Larry (Italian in San Francisco)"
4,Pretty Good Olive Oil,"IMHO, taking everything into consideration, I.E. price, quality, and ok taste, I give this product a positive review. I am somewhat suspect of the stand alone, one star review, posted in this forum as of today's date. It seems to be way too 'over the top' negative. Perhaps the olive oil was old or spoiled or in some other way 'Tainted'. That would make that review valid. However, in my college statistics class the professor points out this kind of review would be disregarded. Throw out the best and the worst reviews and go with what remains.Regards, Emul"
1,Sub Standard Olive Oil,This Olive Oil only has the name from the Movie Godfather. Very Inferior Olive oil for an extra virgin variety. Has no fragrance and seems that this may be a mixture of various oils as some news reports seem to indicate of Italian Olive oils.
1,disappointed,"I ordered this Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil last year and found it to be quite good. It had a nice ""olivey"" flavor and I felt safe ordering it again this year. Unfortunatly this can has none of that ""olivey"" flavor. In fact it is flavorless! I am very disappointed and will probably not order it again.Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 1 GallonSincerely;E. Carlson"
1,Product of Italy means only put in a can in Italy.,"Doesn't taste like olive oil at all.This is one of the tasteless olive oil I have tried.I grew up with olive oil.Most of the exported olive oil from Italy are not what they use to be.They import mix and then export olive oil, and Genco is just that a bottling, caning company.This oil is more likely from Tunisia who has one of the worst oil in the Mediterranean region.Italy as some fine olive oil but this is not it.This doesn't taste like olive oil.About 60% of all olive oil from Italy is not what it is labeled."
3,genco e.v.o.,"a decent product at this price level, but will disappoint anyone expecting a flavorful evo, or one which is good for a salad dressing. the good news is it's price, and the fact it has a rich, buttery taste, and appears to have a relatively high burning temp., so it is good for saute'ing."
1,incredibly low quality EVOO,This extra virgin olive oil is one of the lowest quality EVOOs I have ever tasted. It is very bitter if you taste it on a stand alone sip from a spoon and compare it with a true pure extra virgin olive oil (which tend to be much more expensive ...you get what you pay for). I have tasted dozens of olive oils from around the world. The reason the price is so low is because the quality is incredibly low.
1,Wrong product pictured,"For the record, the item pictured is NOT a Dinosaur Micro P-711 board. You can check Dinosaur's website for a photo of the real P-711.Dinosaur boards have a great reputation, but I'd hesitate to buy one from this vendor. Who knows what I'd receive? If they sent the board pictured here, I'd be out of luck, because this will not fit my fridge."
5,Perfect Half-Sized Bundt Pan!,"Just cut your cake recipe for a standard Bundt (or layer cake) in half, shorten the baking time, and it bakes beautifully in thisNordic Ware Platinum Collection Cast Aluminum Bundt Pan, 6 Cuppan. Nice quality and will last a lifetime if you take care of it. Made in USA!!!"
5,no clue to what kind of manual typewriter you have (like me) this is the perfect ink ribbon !,"got a old (and smelly) manual typewriter. came with the ink ribbons (which turned to dust with one touch), these are good replacements. i dont use mine as much, but i had those suckers for more then two years and they have yet to dry out .....buy them !"
2,"Right ribbon, wrong size",Right ribbon but on the wrong size cartridge! So we ended up unraveling the ribbon from these and reloading onto the former cartridges that we had in the typewriter! A real hassle on Christmas morning!
3,Informative But Matter-of-Fact Biography,"This informative biography suffers by comparison to the graceful and powerful writing in Frank Graham's ""Lou Gehrig: A Quiet Hero."" Robinson's book has more facts and reveals more about Gehrig's faults and problems as well as strengths, but it's like reading an encyclopedia: you may (probably will) wind up caring about Gehrig, but you'll have to fight your way past the dry, unemotional prose to do so. Worth your time if you want to learn more about Gehrig's life and career; skip it if you're looking for an impact similar to the movie (""Pride of the Yankees"")."
3,Not for Adults,"Like most of his other titles, Robinson's biography of Lou Gehrig is a book best not judged by its cover. At first blush and on a brief perusal, it looks like a handsome, serious, thoughtful biography. But upon reading it is mostly hackneyed filler and exhibits no true scholarship. Instead of really telling you anything of importance about Gehrig, you get colorless run-downs of his seasons and a hodge-podge of information primarily culled from other books. That's not entirely bad and not without some merit, for the definitive Gehrig book has yet to be written and this will have to do for now, but it does his subject a disservice. There is also virtually no discussion of the surrounding historical and social context indicated by the title. Gehrig deserved better. Kids may enjoy this, but if you are looking for something substantial, pass."
4,Worth a read for any serious baseball fan,"This is the story of Lou in more than just baseball terms, from his humble upbringing, to his marriage and untimely death. The book is full of great stories and insights by someone who has obviously done their homework on the topic. Alot of fact-correcting with regards to the Ruth-Gehrig squabbles, and sets the record straight on aot of issues. It is not a ""pageturner"", but I came away feeling like I learned a great deal about a baseball legend I thought I knew alot about."
5,A lively writing style blends history and biography,"Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig In His Time charts the life and accomplishments of a truly legendary ball player, plus author Ray Robinson provides the reader with a wealth of background details on the era of baseball through the Depression years. Most of all, it's a recreation of the man who played over two thousand consecutive games before he was diagnosed with the fatal disease named after him. A lively writing style blends history and biography, setting the times and baseball events for newcomers to the sport and providing a vivid account of a legend. Highly recommended: even non-baseball readers will find it engrossing."
4,gammons plus,didn't know peter played a guitar. has a home nearby on the cape. best baseball writer around. music is good but not my syle. 40's and 50's.
5,Gammons Rocks,"Peter hits a home run with his CD. My favorite song is the one he wrote, ""She Fell From Heaven"".My kids like ""Bad Teeth"" and ""Wake Me, Shake Me"".It's a CD you'll listen to over and and over again.""The Commissioner"" not only knows baseball, but music as well."
4,150 magazine ads from 1967 to 2004,"This CD contains about 150 scanned pictures (in jpeg format). They were scanned from US and UK magazines from 1967 through 2004. There is also a picture browser of not very high quality but who needs it when you have the pictures in jpeg in an extra folder.Some of the scans are quite good, some not (the reverse page print shines through, scratches and dust, etc.)The picture resolution is mostly about 1200 x 800 pixels.The CD gives you a good overview of the porsche advertising strategy through time.I was a bit disappointed that there were only american magazine ads (only very few British and three or so French) and no scanned brochures. It had to be time consuming to collect all the magazines so I think the price of this CDROM is adequate."
2,"NICE, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY","Works well on camcorders with larger flip out screens. I tried to use it on my Canon Xh A1, and it was constantly falling off. For the price, the should include a freaking decent clamp or holder of some type. Velcro? Uh, el cheapo! Looks nice, but really nothing more than a small cardboard box with velcro."
4,hoodman works well at certain angles from the sun,it does what it supposed to do. sometimes you cant fight the angles of the sun. i would recommend it!
2,"Bad Picture Quality bad,Really Baaad Picture quality","Okay-I love this band, i knew the past members and still know the remaing live members of this band, This is a cracking period in there history.. The best Line up by far,I had been seeing clips from this show on You tube for a few years now, Save your money and download them from you tube, The picture quality is the same. The sound quality is not to bad considering. The real problem is why this copy? is the one that made it onto DVD."
5,Build & run a robot,"I purchased this toy for my 7 yr-old son for Christmas. He & his Dad had a great time putting it together, which took a little over an hour. It wouldn't work properly the first time, then they realized they put the arms on backwards. When they corrected the arms, it worked perfectly. My son played with it for hours. He's learned that if he makes the robot ""dance"", barely moving him back & forth quickly, the robot's eyes flash. I highly recommend it. It's worth the price."
1,this is junk,"this is a waste of time & money.don't buy.i bought it and within 2 weeks it cracked up and broke apart for no reason,it wasn't dropped or anything.hard shell = easy to break=waste of your money,kapish??????"
5,Delta 31-735A Belt/Disc Sander,This is a professional-quality machine. Very sturdy and reasonably easy to assemble as long as you have some help or access to a hoist. Would certainly recommend it to the shop professional or serious hobbiest. Excellent value.
2,Pictures too graphic for toddlers,"Personal opinion here, but the pictures in this Bible are too graphic for my 2 year old. A naked, voluptious Eve with just the minimum covered. Abel taking a rock to Cain's head with scary rage on his face. People climbing a mountain in terror as they are about the drown in the flood. All true and very realistic depictions, but a little scary nonetheless, and more appropriate for older kids. Returned it and much happier with the Jesus Storybook Bible for my toddler."
3,Dark Shadows:,"Was as far as I'm concerned the worlds first soap opera pertaining to and having to do with vampires (or could I be wrong about that?) I remember watching these on TV back in the 60's and 70's and would like to see them put out an entire complete set of the entire show without having to make you buy several boxed sets but it ran for so long that I don't really know how long it really ran for but I used to be a somewhat avid fan of it because I liked the mysteriousness of it, I recently saw the new Johnny Depp version movie/film and didn't like it all that well because they sort of turned it into a comedy of sorts so it didn't have the same feel as the TV series. So who really knows how long this series ran for on television but I don't want to really buy several boxed sets. Reminded me of Tim Burto's version of Batman (and parts of that were too artsy/fartsy) for my tastes.""Where does he get all of those wonderful toys"". - Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman with Michael Keaton."
5,dark shadows season 20.,"My mother is a fan of dark shadows , so i get them for her as come out.they keep you in suspense , you got to know what is going to happen next.good stage acting.."
2,Check your local frequencies first,"This device limits you to a handful of preset frequencies, all of them at the bottom of the dial. While it has done decent service in my local area, we could not use our iPod at all on a recent trip through Pennsylvania because the stations were constantly in use. Not to mention that the price is pretty high for what this delivers. We will be looking for something else before our next roadtrip. I would have given it 3 stars if not for the lingering frustration at having to listen to lousy commercial radio for four hours!The first company to attach a tuning dial to one of these gadgets will make a fortune. In the meantime, if your area has no stations between 87.9 and 89.1, then perhaps this is the FM transmitter for you."
4,pretty good,"I bought this same exact product over a year ago and it worked wonderfully until one day it just stopped working. I decided to buy the same thing again because I had been so pleased with it. However, this one sometimes gives off this really annoying fairly loud squealing noise. At first I thought it was because of the station but changing the station does not change the noise. It's so annoying that sometimes I will have to turn on the radio or a cd. Luckily though, this noise is not made every time I use the product."
4,It works,I used this product to clean some old nubuck shoes. It did restore the appearance and removed lots of dirt.
4,you can feel the energy,"Great sound, great vibe. I think it's the best of their official live recordings."
5,SWEET,"This CD is simply the best CD he has released. It contains so many of his classics, such as Two Step, Rhyme and Reason, and Jimi Thing. Every song is given so much effort and enthusiasm, and that is what makes this band so good. And for the people who think there are too many live albums, all of them are different! If you are a true fan, you NEVER get tired of the different performances. Dave is extemely talented, and any of his fans would be fools to not buy this."
5,What a Show !!!,Music is played by musicians. And in today's mainstream rock/jazzy/pop music there is no one better at playing music than the boys in Dave Matthews Band.Prepare to droll and to momentarily lose of speech for a few hours.
5,They never got better than this!,"For someone who found (apart from the Chicago set) the other albums uninspired and ponderous.THIS is the real deal! The band play as if their lives depend on it and everytime you think they can't top this they do. The highlights are so many, that it is hard to choose 'crush' has an incredible violin solo following by a great sax solo and the drumming throughout is INCREDIBLE, get the dvd to watch a top drummer in action! 'rhyme and reason' has one of the most amazing piano solo's i've ever heard and it builds and builds and guest Warren Hayes guitar work on 'jimi thing' could of done without the 'cortez' cover because it really didn't fit too well. After this i got all the live album and was surprised at the lack of fire in the other performances, but thank goodness this was recorded. I'd honestly put it up there as one of the greatest live albums of all time and then they f++k it up by releasing 'everyday'!"
5,DMB At Their Finest!!!,"Seen Dave Matthews Band about 75 times or so live. Not only was this THE best show I have ever seen them play, but the CD set is awesome as well! Must buy if you appreciate the band's music. Highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed."
4,"PD good, but missing a hit","This cd is very good, but I didn't like a few things. First of all on the cd there is not the song Crash Into Me, this is one of their greatest hits, and one of my favorites, disappointed it wasn;t on the cd. Second, there is no need for three cds. There is an average 7 songs per disc, and I think it should be compacted into 2 cds. Despite my commets, don't not buy this cd. Other than missing Crash it is a great cd."
2,Same Songs Different Day,"I was excited about this cd because it was for such a good cause and DMB is such a great band .... But COME ON...How many Live CDs can DMB subject us too with the same songs over and over on every one. I had to turn this off.. Boyd Tinsley ruined this CD for me. If I was a the concert I would have prayed his amps would quit working. He ruins the songs.. especially live!! If you are a DMB fan, buy it for your collection - but I guarantee you wont listen to that much."
3,adorable but....,These shoes are GORGEOUS! But they're about a half size too big so I cannot wear them.
4,Great aftermarket MAF replacement,"First off, the image is just a stock image from Python's website and IS NOT the actual MAF. The product is just the regular old black plastic MAF that looks exactly like the stock one. It's not the awesome alloy metal looking one in the picture on here. That being said, it's a great aftermarket replacement for the stock MAF. You probably won't notice any gains with it but you will definitely feel the difference in throttle response. I'm not sure the effect it has on unmodified intakes, but if you have a cold air intake, this will help you make the best of it. I had one of these installed 7 months ago and it started acting up because it started failing. Luckily, it was covered under warranty by [...] where I bought the first one. Only had this one installed so far for just under 1,000 miles so I can't be for sure if it's not going to fail like the last one but so far, it's doing great."
1,Spoken Word CD,"Although I never listened to the CD, I can tell you that it is a spoken word CD that was not authorized by the band. It contains no original music and it has been returned."
1,"Ummm... Customer Service, please?","Yes, this is a copy-paste. Why is this item even on Amazon?""Although I never listened to the CD, I can tell you that it is a spoken word CD that was not authorized by the band. It contains no original music and it has been returned."""
2,Velbon DF-60 cheap plastic leg locking mechanism,"I liked the specifications and reviews and purchased Velbon DF-60 from Amazon. I am an occasional photographer, who handles the equipments gently. However, on the third day, the locking mechanism for one of the legs broke. Assuming that it is a one time problem, I returned the tripod and bought another Velbon DF-60 from Amazon. This also broke after two months. Even when gently used, the cheap plastic parts break. I will never buy another Velbon product."
4,"High Quality, Low Price","Compared to what else you have to chose from, this is great quality for under $50."
4,Excellent for the price,"I wanted a second tripod to go along with my old Star-D and picked the DF-60. It's better. I'm using it with a 400mm equivalent DSLR lens and a 20-60x spotting scope. It even handles the two in combination for digiscoping. I would have given it another star if the quick-swap plate had a safety catch to back up its spring lever, but I don't know of any other tripods that have anything like that. I had a question and the customer service folks were very responsive."
5,Great value - all the features needed,"Like the other reviewer - I checked out tripods at a camera store. Hadn't heard of Velbon, but a quick Internet search showed them to be a recognized name in tripods. I needed a tripod for my Nikon D50 (especially with the 70-300mm zoom lens), and perhaps a video camera, and the DF-60 fit the bill - lightweight, quick to set up, leveling bubble, detachable baseplate, etc. Sure, it's pretty much all plastic, but if you take care of your equipment - shouldn't make that much difference for non-professional use. It's stable enough with the built-in leg brace spreader. The price at the camera store was almost $70 - Amazon beat them by a mile. Received it in a few days. So far - everything I though it would be. Highly recommended if you need a lighweight tripod. Now I need to get a bag so I can sling it over my shoulder."
2,Cheaply made plastic.,Not for the even REMOTELY serious photographer. Might hold up a P&S but that's about it. Wouldn't reccomend to a friend.
4,very stable,good for price. - pretty good quality a little heavy for pack trips but great for the car. My 6 year old uses it a lot with me and after 3 years it still works!!
4,Great Buy,"Very nice. Very well made. Although it is not stated in the product description, this tripod comes with a case, so don't bother buying one separately."
4,An excellent introduction to the meat goat world.,"When Gail Bowman isn't authoring books or magazine articles about goats, she is a full-time goat rancher. Little wonder, then, that her knowledge on the subject is so extensive.If you are new to the industry, or are considering raising meat goats (whether for profit or not), this book is a must have."
4,Raising Meat Goats for Profit,"A good reference for the potential meat goat breeder. A little outdated, but the facts and information are all topical and well documented."
5,Wish I'd purchased this book first,"Just a quick endorsement: We started raising goats last summer and I bought this book for my husband for Christmas 2009 along with another book. He had the other book (unknown to me) but not this one. After reading this one he told me it was a great book and he wished he had been able to read this one first. He got a lot more out of this one that the other book and praised this book highly. I haven't read it myself, so am not able to review the nitty gritty and compare it to other books. I merely wanted to let anyone know who is interested that my husband thinks this is the best book on raising goats that he's found."
5,Fantastic first insect book!,"My 5 year old son loves insects! He chose this book at of all the ones available here on Amazon. It has fabulous close up illustrations and actual photos. Each species is catagorized, with details on type of species and how they are different from one to another. I recommend this books for any parents little future scientist! :)"
4,Simon & Schuster Children's Guide to Insects and Spiders,This is a wonderful inspiring book for children. The information and diagrams are great. But above all the photographs are incredible and my child couldn't wait to turn the page to discover what was next. This has encouraged her even more to go outside and find new things.
4,Not as Comphrensive as I Expected,"My 6 year old son is going through a bug phase right now, so I ordered him this book for Christmas. It is very informative, and we really enjoy the illustrations, but I was expecting it to be more comprehensive. I should have paid more attention to the number of pages! But it is a great introduction to the many varieties of spiders and insects. It is not, however, a complete encyclopedia! More of a ""greatest hits of the bug world""."
5,Great book,"I got it for good friend's 6 yr old, he loved it. He's into insects these days and stays up at night reading it."
5,insects/spiders...,"Grandkids loved it. We have lots of bugs @ our house ,esp. when they stay overnite in the summer.Great ID!"
2,Daily serving = 4 capsules,"Since these are 4-a-day capsules, not 1-a-day like my favorite, Twinlab Daily One Caps, they really are more than twice as expensive. However, they might make a good option for someone who wants to get more calcium in their supplement since these have more."
3,Powder-filled rather than solid capsule,"I didn't realize this product contained capsules that are full of powder. I thought they were going to be solid capsules that I could cut in half, as I prefer to take my multi-vitamin in half doses morning and evening. It may be a great multi, but it's form was not what I was looking for."
2,Poor Delivery,"I have waited delivery of this product for 20 days. Other products in the same shopping cart was delivered in a week. Plus, it is not provided to track your package from amazon web site because of Swanson Co. It doesn't worth to comment..."
4,Hoodman H-300 For Video Camera; a solution for a dim LCD,"I bought this hood for my Sony Video Camera which has no viewfinder. The images on the LCD screen were impossible to see in sunlight. This hood lays flat for easy storage and is fairly secure on the LCD. Having it on the LCD makes for better viewing of images on the LCD. It is not perfect, but I can now see what I am videoing, making better videos. I recommend this product to anyone who does not have a viewfinder on their video or digital still camera and has a hard time seeing images on the LCD in sunlight. Hoodman makes different models for different applications."
3,Quite poorly made,"I have bought this hoodman 300, i am a bit disapointed in the build quality, its raggedy and uneven,, considering i paid 25 for it, its just 4 bits of cheap plastic sewn into cloth, and very poor velcroe that dosent stick very well, not great, but i suppose it does the job..just.. if there was something better i would buy that unstead, i feel ripped off.."
5,"we had one, it was great, want another one","Living in Chicagoland we need a really good brush/scraper combo and this is the best one ever.What makes it the best are three attributes:1. The scraper is brass. (The brass will remove the ice easily but it bends enough to not scratch.)2. The length of the handle is just right for reaching across to the center of the winshield.3. The long handled snow brush easily reaches the snow on the hood and the top of the car.After several years, one corner of the plastic that holds the brass scraper broke off. We want another one but can't find it anywhere. What happened? It's the perfect snow brush/scraper and no one has it anymore. There isn't another like it that I have found on the internet anywhere. If I find where you can get one I will post it here. Please add a comment to my review if you know where to get one! Thanks!"
3,Snowbrush is average,"Snowbrush was cheap and as a result is cheaply made, but sufficient for use. Will probably not last 2 winters."
1,worthless garbage. do not buy.,"This thing is junk. It runs ridiculously hot, has no ventilation for the drives, and uses a bizarre proprietary networking stack. You need special drivers to make it work- drivers that aren't available for many OS's- and they are buggy as hell, making the box they are installed on unstable.Don't waste your money on this piece of ****."
1,worst product ever,"The Netgear SC101 is probably the worst NAS device I've ever used. It does NOT work without installing the special netgear software. Forget SMB/FTP or any standards based connectivity. Linux/Mac cannot use. It will grab about 10 dhcp addresses for no apparent reason, and the included configuration utility is garbage.This is my very first Amazon review, and I'm only writing this because the sc101 sits in my desk unused and netgear was not apologetic regarding how awful this thing truly is. Do not buy or don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Be careful!,"Apparently there are some crossed wires here - sellers and buyers, check this out carefully! ""Histoires"" is a two-disc, best-of compilation. Twice, I have purchased what I thought was ""Histoires"" only to be shipped by two different sellers, the single 1988 disc ""If"" - that's the cover image shown above. NOT THE SAME DISC! Somehow, someone inputted the wrong bar code or something..."
3,Too short for the price,"I knew that the video was 30 minutes in length...but I didn't know they would spend 10 minutes on the history of Kauai with some black and white footage. I also felt it was a little bit of a commercial for the helicopter tours and for the garden tour, where they spent 10 minutes showing close ups of the statues. That left 10 minutes to show a few beaches, no restaurants or nightlife, no indication of the differences between the north shore and south shore, which is what I wanted to see to help me decide where to stay. Nothing about the interesting foods to try. Now the good news, it did show some beautiful footage, just not enough. They did offer a free refund if not satisfied, so I am not complaining. It just didn't meet my expectations."
4,Good book,"This is an easy to read, logical book to help with bringing home baby. I found a lot of the information very useful and I will be putting it to use very soon."
5,Fantastic!,"I have a one year child, and this book help my family to keep our dog inside the house, but outside the path of our baby since day 1. It is simple and accurate."
5,Three thumbs up,I read Mr. Wombacher's book after hearing him speak on a local radio program in my town.I was immediately able to identify problem areas in my relationship with my dog and fix them.When I encountered a few things with my dog that I wasn't sure how to handle even with the good instructions in the book I called Mr. Wombacher and he was kind enough to spend twenty minutes on the phone with me free of charge to help me with my issue. He took great care to address my concerns and showed great generosity of spirit in dealing with me.I highly recommend his book and whatever services he might have to offer.
5,Great training tips,"I love this book. I'm a trainer in New Orleans and have actually recommended this book for clients as a good primer on relationship building and problem solving, regardless of whether there's a baby in the house.The book is short, direct and to the point. It's well organized and heavily cross referenced making it easy to use. I highly recommend it."
3,"Not bad, Tons of Information","I did like this book, it was not bad at all. There is tons of information that has been somewhat helpful. I am 8 months pregnant and trying to help my dog get adjusted before the baby arrives. So, I am following some of the tips that the trainer gave and we will see what happens next month..."
1,"IF YOU REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!","What a terrible approach! Don't loose your money and your patience with this book.I think it's pretty sad, coming from a certified expert on dog behavior..."
4,Gatherer of Clouds,"Wonderful sequel for Initiate Brother. It continued the character development and suspense of Part 1, but also had more pessimism."
4,These two books are scrumptious,"An excellent series. Can't say kind words about this later books, however. I'd sooner endure a brisk caning than read most Sean Russell books. They're a real snore."
5,Equally as engaging as The Initiate Brother,"The Initiate Brother left readers on a cliffhanger, making it obvious that these two books are really just one giant novel under separate covers. Thus, the reader doesn't have to worry about the quality of the sequel, which is as entrancing as the first book. Both are engrossing stories of love, war, religion, politics, and intrigue, certainly one of the best series of this type in the fantasy genre, right up there with Frank Herbert's Dune."
2,"Unfortunately, incomplete...","I like Lucas' work, and this book is no exception. I didn't realize though that there was a packet of drawings that came with the book, which wasn't included. So far, I haven't found a supplier of those cards/illustrations. So, slightly disappointed that I don't have the complete set, though, without seeing them, I suppose I may still be successful without them. There is a theory that the pictures you make up yourself will be more effective than those produced by others, but I'm not completely convinced."
5,Even I can remember,The transaction was excellent--all expectations met. The book and associated materials are exactly in the condition as listed. I am pleased with the purchase.The book makes a great use of pictograms to enforce memory of the Gospels. It is well put together. I'm learning more than I ever thought I would.
3,"Yak, Yak, Yak.....","Pros: Very good stretches, including lateral stretches not seen on a lot of other yoga videos. Clear instructions, nice scenery.Cons: Linda says to use this tape 3 times a week for maximum benefit. To me, she talks so much that if I were to use this tape on a regular basis I'd be standing there with the remote in my hand to fast forward all the inactive time, which is considerable.Also, when she says to repeat something, it's just a rerun of her first demonstration. That's okay until she does sun salutations, and if you follow her, you do the right side twice and the left side not at all.I would much prefer her doing a voice over while the poses are being demonstrated rather than forcing the viewer to sit and watch her talk. Some of her comments are more chit chat than instructional.I would buy this tape (I borrowed it from the library) were it not for so much yak, yak, yakking."
3,So So,Got this for my husband. He roofed our house this fall. Never did anything like that before. Said he still had some questions unanswered. But it was helpful. The rest he had to figure out himself.
1,Cheap piece of toy.,This is an item I would never buy again. Our kids are still little and they did not play with it. It is very cheap but it will be in the trash before the winter comes. The ball is just inflateble so it blew away the very first day. For
1,Not what i thought it was,i didn't look at my product very good. I thought it was more durable. It was very light weight and more for a todler who has an indoor pool with no wind. My bad
2,ccgjbg,okay for the little price but would have gone with the more expensive one.this is mainly a blow up NOTHING! PLAYED WITH IT ONCE. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!
4,Great collection of gunfights and confrontations,"The book is a collection of about a dozen or so stories of gunfights and confrontations during the days of the Old West. A highly entertaining read, if you like Westerns, or if you like reading about lots and lots of actions, then this book is must read for you.The book is broken down into sections of One-on-One Duels, Gangs, Posses, Holdups, Back-Shooters and Mishaps. The author cites numerous sources per account, and sorts of breaks down each account into its most basic and most important parts. What I like about the author, is that he is always careful to note what is fact, and what is speculation. Still you end up with a very good read to while your free hours away. Highly recommended."
5,one of my favorite teachers,"This dvd helps tremendously if you live a busy lifestyle. You get a workout, and David's voice is very pleasant. He doesn't get in to a lot of perfectionistic details of poses, but rather, gives you the basics and lets you move into it at your level and ability. You have room for your own interpretation in a pose. The setting is beautiful, and you will feel like you've had a good workout in very little time. Great intro to more advanced ashtanga."
3,Yoga likes long forms,"This set of short yoga classes is a compromise. It could be more or less useful if you have been practising yoga for a considerable period of time, but for beginners it is not that great.I found that the 45 minute program does not provide enough warm-up and, naturally, skips some postures, so I was not prepared for some asanas, my muscles were still somewhat tight and not warm enough to do the asanas comfortably. I still was able to do all the postures, it just did not feel quite right.You can use this DVD when there is no time and a short form would be better than no form at all, but, in my opinion, yoga likes long forms."
5,fantastic dvd!,"I love this DVD. After a long search, I finally found a video that covered all the bases and was a great workout as well as a soulful journey. I am addicted to it and feel great!"
5,One of my very favorite yoga DVDs,"This DVD is a must-have for anyone who loves classical yoga but isn't advanced enough to make it through the entire ashtanga Primary Series. It contains three abbreviated routines (15, 30, and 45 minutes) based on the Primary Series but geared to advanced beginners or intermediate practitioners. David Swenson is an excellent instructor who adopts a leisurely pace that allows you to sink into each posture and focus on alignment. His commentary throughout is calm and to the point. I turn to this DVD more often than any other single yoga DVD and it's helped my practice tremendously."
4,Great for a quick ashtanga session,"I use this DVD for a quick ashtanga session in the mornings before work when I want a guided practice. I have only done the 45 minute one. Although it obviously doesn't cover every pose, I think it's pretty good for being only 45 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this DVD for someone who has never done ashtanga before, but for those who want a quick practice session, it's pretty good!"
5,The Best!,"For the best in precision leveling equipment, the Machinist's Precision level is perfect. At 0.005"" per foot, this level is more than adequate for sensitive mechanical machine set-up."
1,you get what you payed for!,i bought this part for my ipod mini. it came in a reasonable time but the one thing that has really bothered me about it is that after installing it my ipod started acting up more than normal. within a couple of days it would not respond and now the only thing it will do is display the apple logo! :-( i would never recommend purchasing such a cheap product made by this company otherwise you will be like me ipodless!
3,Useful,"While it's a bit flimsy, I don't really see a way to improve on the product and it does what it's supposed to do."
3,"It does its job, but...","I can't really say more than it does what it says it is supposed to do, although it does a slow, cheap job.The product is cheaply made and, while it didn't leak (which is the shaker's one strong point), the lid sticks and needs to be run under hot running water to get off, even after only one round of drinks is made with it. The pouring area pours very slowly. I'm thinking the holes are just too small. I think I'm going to go back to my stainless steel shaker/strainer which was quick and easy, although not as pretty to look at."
1,"Radio is great ""The Sportsman's Guide"" reseller sucks","take a look at that confusing image and the ""Two Pack"" title. in case you missed it you are not getting 4 radios, only 2.So, shame on you ""The Sportsman's Guide"" for using such sleazy marketing tricks.buy the Midland but not from ""The Sportsman's Guide""!"
4,Biblical advice for an epidemic in the Body of Christ,"Steve Farrar is known for his books targeted to men. Writing with his wife, Mary, he addresses both men and women who do too much in this book. This small volume contains Biblical advice for combating the drive to do too much, and to cope when life's circumstances cause almost unbearable pressure. Farrar is one of the best writers in the Christian market - he communicates a warmth and sense of humor that make the material more understandable. Highly recommended."
5,Overcoming Overload,"Never have I read a book that helped me deal with an issue taking over my life. I am glad to say that I learned ways in which to reorganize my life and not be so overloaded that I find my self ""stressed""...there is a way out!"
4,One of the greatest stories ever told,"Hottenton Venus was quite superb! What a depressing part of history to know that this South African woman Sarah Baartman was victimized emotionally, physically and fiancially, by the hands of those ""Eurpoeans"" that were to uplift her.The author does a wonderful job in writing and speaking in many of her character voices, giving the reader an in-depth chance to know and analyze the characters. I felt an emotional attachment to Alice, she was a true person and very good to Sarah. The only slight problem in the book was some of the vocabulary used especially in reference to the Khoeke tribe. A tribe that today is lesser known.Some readers depending on their origin, or not, may feel very uncomfortable with Cuvier's studies in Anthropology and Evolution. No matter how depressing the subject matter, this a fascinating part of history that we should all know."
5,"AMAZING, amazing, AMAZING!!!","I want to thank the other reviews who sold me on this book because here it is, 6 am, and I can't put it down.For a fascinating and disturbing look into this woman's story, written with lush descriptions and unforgiving honesty, I highly recommend it as well.LOL @ the other two haters - your BS was helpful to NO ONE and that alone speaks for itself. GTFOHWTBS. Truth hurts."
5,hottentot venus,"Very interesting book...my second copy, I ordered another copy for a friend. Thankyou for such prompt attention to my order."
1,Cry me another river,"Another ""white man bad"" screed. What should have been a fascinating story ends up being a platform for the author's own bigotry. Skip it."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"The book's write up sounds exactly what I was looking for, ideas on updating existing landscapes. Needless to say I was disappointed. There was nothing new that a gardener would not have already have read in Southern Living or Country Home Gardens magazines. Its fine for a glance at Barnes and Noble with a cup of coffee, but don't waste your money taking it home."
4,"Lots of Inspiration, But Not Much How-To Detail","I would say this is a worthwhile book if you are looking for pictures of made-over yards and decks. There are very few ""before"" pictures and not a lot of detail on how to achieve the results. The process is explained, from planning on paper to renovating walks, concrete stoops, garden beds and plantings.Examples of various projects are shown in photographs and described in some detail. Pruning and moving shrubs and trees are shown. There is not a lot of specific information about plants. There is a very brief discussion of water features.This book is a good place to start the process, but unless you already have construction and horticultural skills, you will need additional information to actually complete a project."
3,Very Terse Treatment of a Broad Range of Topics,"If you are already familiar with the material, this book is a concise and clear reference, and yes a great buy. But for learning these topics from the beginning, you would be better served by other books that are focused on just a particular topic.For example, for logic in the context of set theory, I highly recommend Daniel Velleman's How to Prove it."
3,Good for self-study or nonmajors,"It is really more about foundational issues than sets and logic. The preface says this was intended as a one-year course in the foundations of math for upper division math majors. The delivery is slow and gentle, rather wordy, and a bit stodgy -- not always crystal clear about what point he is making. It is suitable for students who have no experience with higher math. I don't know about students at the author's school, but I think it would try the patience of most seniors or grad students in math. I would recommend it more to lower division and philosophy majors."
3,Good book in an introductory level...,"This is a good book for an introductory course on the subject. It contains the basic topics, but if you are looking for strong introduction to mathematical logic, maybe this is not a good choice. In any case, you can take it for granted since contains a very good selection of topics and perhaps you can support it with other books."
3,Not what I expected,"I found it very interesting to learn about how sesame street was branching out into other cultures and countrys, but I had expected it would be more like a sesame street episode exploring different cultures and countries. I was hoping for something for my kids to enjoy and learn from instead of a documentary. My kids weren't interested and I didn't even watch the whole thing."
2,Too PC,"I love the muppets, but find this particular SS episode too politically-correct for my kid. Given the fact most other peoples want us Americans dead and our great nation destroyed, I think we should teach our kids how to defend themselves and their homeland, instead of making friends with people who hate us and want us slaughtered."
3,too thin,"I didn't read the description very carefully I guess. These towels are very large (2 feet by 3 feet) but the material is quite thin. You basically have to fold them a few times in order to use them. I would have preferred smaller, but much thicker and therefore more absorbent towels."
1,NOT the size advertised,"Didn't even open these when I saw the label through the wrapping stating they are 20""x30"". Are you kidding? Flour sack towels less than 2'x3'? Please. These will be returned.If you need real flour sack size towels, avoid these."
4,Good Bachata Cd,This cd i bought at the recommendation of another person.Im gonna give it 4stars because i dont really like some songs and a cd that gets 5 stars is one that you dont skip songs.Besides everything i recommend it the artist has a good voice and the music is great also but dont expect to enjoy it all.
5,Excellent,"I'm an 'instrument purist' in general. I like to listen to music in the instruments for which it was written. A few exceptions: Bach in piano, Mussorsky in organ, and definitely Rodarmer's guitar interpretation of the Goldberg Variations.This CD is a pleasure to listen to. Rodarmer is a virtuoso, who interprets Bach very profoundly and shows off where he has to :)The sound of the two guitars he plays is impecable, crisp, and very nice to listen to. The use of guitars in the variations bring out new aspects of the music I hadn't noticed before.Notice that Rodarmer is playing 2 guitars, one of which was constructed especially for this project. That way he plays the variations AS THEY ARE WRITTEN, note by note, not *arranging* them for guitar.Very nice buy.Excellent quality.Highly recommended."
5,extraordinarily delicate yet played with abandon,This is the most interesting playing of The Goldberg Variations I have ever heard. Rodarmer evokes more feeling from his guitars than a keyboard ever was capable of. He claims it is absolutely true to the original arrangement.
1,Not good,"The music just comes off as fabricated for new age listeners and dull, much like the Jonas Brothers is created for tweens. I don't sense any soul inside the ambient sounds other than the rhythm to make money off this swill. There are better and truer artists out there making music, so I would recommend avoiding this travesty and moving onto something more real."
4,This is so very wrong...,"Y'know, before I checked this manga series out, I never would've considered incest to be even remotely amusing. But for some reason, this smutty series depicting a young man's sick little urges and the mother & sister who fulfill them leaves me yukkin' it up like a mental patient every time I read it. Throw in a dalliance with the next-door neighbor's wife, and our randy protagonist's final inner battle against his evil split personality, and you've got one of Japan's most bizarre and hilarious naughty book imports out there!The final chapter includes few other depraved brother-sister relationships, including a little gender-bending story that I didn't care for (BTW why do hentai mangaphiles find she-males so interesting, anyway?). But, I can overlook that little lull in the fun, since it's at the very end. And there's plenty of other depraved illustrations & captions to get happy with!`Late!"
2,Not Good,"If you were looking for a detailed graphic novel, this is not it. Others such as Domin 8 Me or Milk Mama are well drawn in much more detail. I expected this to be of the same type but it is not the case. Story isn't bad, but drawing is very poor. Not worth the money."
5,Exceptional Poetry,This is a very spiritual and sometimes dark collection of poems by a very gifted poet. Carole Borges brings to life in her words the colorful souls of the past. The imagery that she provides is haunting in its beauty.
5,RON,"Rise of Nations is the product that learned from the mistakes of games like Age of Empires, Starcraft, and Red Alert. As the commander of a unique civilization, you get to control every aspect of your nation--- military, society, and economy---all with new ideas and concepts that are easy to adapt to. This game is two steps beyond anything in its genre."
4,Great game but not as good as Age of Empires,This is a good edition to aoe but not the best this game is way easier to beat then aoe and this game gets boring real fast and aoe never gets boring also this game has a TON of buggs in it even good computers wont play it well!
4,Beta software at best - beware!,"First off this is a great game. Second, I can only get through about 30 minutes as it comes to a crashing halt with a big freeze up. Yes, I have updated drivers, enough memory, blah blah blah. Nothing helps and I'm not the only one. check out the message boards for this game.Other than that, I highly recommend it but even more I recommend downloading the demo and playing it for a long while to see if it crashes. If it doesn't... you'll probably have luck with the full version.Frankly I would wait for a patch to be released and then try it.the Four Stars is for the stuff I've actually been able to do minus one star for the crashing.UPDATEOne new video card later and I'm back in business. That was the entire problem. No, it wasn't an old video card (ATI 8500 -- ok a little old) but who cares. It works now."
2,Rise of Nations... and frustration,"I found the game to be fun and rather challenging... when it worked. The upgrades from civ to civ happen quickly and are hard to manage effectively, but you get the hang of it after a while. Unfortunately, you also get the hang of saving your game frequently. I have a powerful new PC and the game just stops instantly. No error message, no warning -- you just go back to your desktop. And there's no autosave feature, so if you've been playing your first time and are 1 hour into it -- poof! It's all gone. Quite frustrating. Sadly, not much of a surprise, considering it's a Microsoft game."
3,Reveiw of Rise of nations,"Hi guys. This game is extremley fun, but I give it only three stars because right now Microsoft is having a software problem so it freezes every now and then. Heres the gist of the game. You start out in the ancient age with only a small city and a library with five citizens. You work your way through the ages by doeng research at the library collecting neccisary rescourses such as oil,metal,food,knowledge,wood. and wealth.Tip for player: Conduct diplomacy with your opposing nation(s), build a giagantic army then wage war.Overall this is a great game. Keep up the good work, Microsoft!"
2,"A decent start, but....","I'm a fan of all these RTS games, and Age of Empires is still the winner. While there are some improved gameplay features, Rise of Nations seems rushed to market, with no scenarios or great history lessons like Age of Empires and Empire Earth. I'm a history buff, and was always impressed with Age of Empires campaigns ability to teach while you were playing it. Is this game just a foundation to sell more follow-on scenario packs? If so, that's slimy.Other gameplay features missing: no ability to build walls! The advancement from age to age is also far too quick - Empire Earth does a much better job here. I do think the graphics and overall interface is nicer than EE though. Overall, a dissapointment."
1,Needs a usable interface,"Ack! So many of the RTS games have the same interface. Its horrible. The multiple city aspect of this game only makes it worse. Its nearly impossible to fight a major battle as well as keep your cities producing because you have to go and find each city, click on each building and upgrade/build with it. A simple sidebar that allows you to keep your cities running without leaving the battle would be awesome. As it is its just a frustrating experience. The addition of the researching just makes for one more thing you have to try to keep track of in this jumbled game.Obviously this game is a meld of Civilization and Age of ""Whatever"". It fails at both and leaves you in a click fest where you have no time to think and no time to act.I hope these games move away from the frantic clicking to a more thought out strategy game, but I dont see it happening because people play these game like they're going out of style. I for one hope they are."
1,Might be good.......,"This game might be a good one.... If I could play it on my laptop. If your like me and 1 million others that only have an 8MB of memory on a laptop, DON'T get this- it won't work on your computer. I was looking forward to playing this too, don't fall into the same trap I did."
1,this game stinks,I really did not lke this game becuase all the grafics were terrible and the plot was pahetic.
2,Nice graphics but same ol thing,"The game *looks* nice. But it's just a click fest like the other hundred games in this genre. If you enjoy mousing around faster than your opponent, you'll dig it. If you enjoy more strategy then get Civ III."
3,Overblown game,"Once again, ""tank rush"" is the operative word. Makers of strategy games don't truly get the picture yet and this one is no exception. Who ever builds quickest and overruns their opponent wins. Play is simplistic, tactics are a waste of time and winning is incredible easy at all levels. If you want something to kill time, don't really want to think or be challanged, then jump on this. If not, there are better, including some of the developers earlier games."
2,Age Of the Mythology Copy,"When I purchased Rise of Nations, I was expecting a new game not an exact copy of Age of Mythology. There was nothing new about this game, it was setup exactly like Age of Mythology. You have to gather wood and goal, and your given cheesy missions to complete. Then you have to advance through the ages, again just like Age of Mythology. If you own Age of Mythology than don't even bother buying this game. I wasn't impressed with the graphics and the game was just weak."
2,Rise of the Sequel!,"If you liked the other Age of Empires games, you'll love this game. It is nearly identical to the previous games, with updated graphics and a few minor improvements. I thought the whole series rather boring and uninspired, hence the poor review."
4,Rise of Nations Great!,This is a Great game one of the best go From the Ancient age to the Information age i give it 9/10 because its missing Walls but its still a great game and another thing recouses dont depleet over time rise of nations is the greats R-T-S game so make sure to get it
2,repetitive and personality changing,When I first bought this game it was pretty fun. It has nice graphics.After about one and a half months it started to be repetitive and I was getting tired of killing people. I stopped playing it. Then my 7 year old younger brother became addicted to it. Finaly my mom had to take it away from him. He has never been the same since.
3,Needs a little nip n' tuck.,"I bought this game because I played Age of Empires I & II and the expansions, as well as Age of Mythology (and Titans), and was hoping for something new; something different.It's different, but hardly new.The look and feel of Age of Mythology has me jaded, apparently.The look of RoN is anything but cutting-edge, even at the highest resolutions.The game plays like any other RTS, with an emphasis on upgrading this and that.The battles are less-than-spectacular in single-player games. I can only hope that it gets better online."
5,MUST BUY,"This is probably the best computer game I've played! The coolest part of the game is probably how you start out with swords, and how you will end with rocket launchers and nuclear missles. You can play either a quick game (an ordenary game) or conquer the world. In couquer the world you pick a nation you want to be then you go to a map of the world (looks almost the same as a risk map does) and then you can go take territories from indians, or go take on another nation (I would'nt take on another nation at the begining of the game). By now you probably want to go by the game now, but before you do you should know that you will probably have buy a video card. I had to do that, but now I know that it payed off to buy the video card instead of not playing the game at all. This is a must buy game, so make sure you go and get it."
