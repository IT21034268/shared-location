5,"Awww, it's so cute!","I absolutley love these dolls! The clothes are gorgeous and their faces and hair are beautiful.I think that they are going to be great for younger kids, the educational value is practically none-exsitant, but what does that matter with a toy?I think that I might buy the doll just for the clothes! I wish they would come up with the clothing packs with these gorgeous jammies, so it's not so expensive or so we don't have doubles in the dolls.A great series in the Bratz line, I think I'm going to wait and see if they actually do come out with the clothes!"
5,Really Nice!!!!!,"This is my second Nighty-Nite doll, my other one is Yasmin. I love the Nighty Nite collection. This doll, Cloe, is especially nice!! I like her PJ top, since it can be worn as a regular shirt. I am planning on getting Nighty-Nite Jade, too!!I totally recommend it,THANKSPS Even my mom, who doesnt like bratz thinks the clothes are nice!!"
3,Now here's something...,"Dude what's up with her robe? It looks like it could just fall apart! And actually I got the Sasha (and although I lost her) They don't fit in the sleeping bags, I think thats for the accesories.Overall, she isn't that great. Really. Sasha's a TON better. Her Pjs won't rip apart!"
2,EEEEEKKKK!!!!!,"I loooooooooooove bratz, even though i'm in 7th grade. Nobody needs to know. But I must admit, this is the ugliest bratz collection ever! The clothes look like they're from a mix of Victoria's Secret and the dump. But, excluding this one, Bratz rock!!"
4,"""Whatever happened to the life that we once knew?""","As others has pointed out, the 3 volumed Beatles Anthology sets didn't include all they could have (particularly the 1st 2 volumes). Since there are 3 tracks not on any of the Anthology CD's, this is worth collecting (it's too bad this and the Real Love CD were discontinued in the USA).The ""new"" Beatles song actually evolved from a 1977 John Lennon demo and the other 3 added their musical contributions onto it. There is a demo of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" (the entire 9th take). There are 2 takes of ""This Boy,"" which feature John and Paul giggling during vocal snafu's! Finally, there is the complete musical version of the Beatles' ""Christmas Time (Is Here Again),"" taken from their 1967 Christmas record (with individual Christmas greetings from Paul, John, George and Ringo from the previous year). George Martin plays ""Auld Lang Syne"" on the organ as John recites a Christmas poem.Included on the cover is John Lennon's unique artwork."
5,The Beatles at Their Best!,Quality of product was excellent and only goes to prove that only the Beatles can top themselves!
3,"Long, Long, Long","Did you know that this comes from a land down under? Well, it does and I've been waiting 2 weeks for this 4 SONG single. A heafty wait for such a short cd. It seems that Amazon forgot to disclose the fact that this is so rare, you can only get it from Australia! I will give it some credit for the brilliant song, Free as a Bird, but seriously, why wait when you can get it faster from the Anthology?"
1,Swiss army watch,I purchased this item from Mister watch online thru Amazon .To this date i have not received the watch or a refund even though i have sent numerous emails to the company.
3,I expected more for the price,"So I've owned this watch for over a year now and while it looks sharp, it is somewhat of a bog watch and I have had to send it back to Victronix twice now to replace the battery. That's just crappy. Anyways, the features are tough to use as well. This isn't part of my review but the last time I got the watch back from servicing they forgot to screw the back into the watch so now I have to send it in to them for the 3rd time. I'm tired of it."
2,should have done my homework,"I usually do my homework and read reviews from real people before buying anything, I don't know what got into me this time, full moon??? I bought this and it seemed ok in the store, but the other reviews have it right: it is not very good as a metronome-you can't hear it over a live instrument! AND the tuner does not always tune correctly, it can be off-BAD if you are a student trying to train your ear! I wish I had looked on here to get info before I bought this, hope I can return it......"
4,"Nice Tuner, bad Metronome","Tuner is good. Maybe even perfect.Metronome is awful due to uselessness. Too low beep. I can hear if if only listen METRONOM. When I play, I can't hear it at all.There is not possibility route metronome beep to output.In fact metronome is absent."
1,Waste. Of. Money.,"Doesn't register hardly anything, it feels cheaply made, and I literally threw it away upon realizing that it didn't work worth a damn. Do not buy."
5,One Boss Tuner!!!,"My friend has one, and I needed one to tune my 12-String Guitar. It worked perfectly. The best thing about It, Is the price. I told my friends about it, what it does, the cost, and where to get It."
3,Comparing with a Korg,This tuner is ok for some uses. but I do not recomend it for tuning a steel guitar. It does not respond as good as a Korg.
2,excellent or useless,"the tuner part of this is okay. as another user mentioned, it works best in a quiet room. also works well if you plug directly into the guitar output.the metronome is junk. even on new batteries after prolonged use it shuts off. it is quiet. the only plus side is that you can set it easily."
2,Not so good...,"This unit is a servicable tuner, and metronome, but you can do better in both departments for sure.I find it useless for acoustic guitars if there is any background noise. Even just a TV on with normal volume nearby seems to prevent it from getting a clean read.The metronome is annoying because of the lack of volume, and the fact that it's plays an electronic tone instead of clicks. Not a good idea.Metronomes should click..click click click click...."
2,They use to be a quality company,For the price I've seen better...it really isn't all it's cracked up to be and the construction of it is just wrong...plastic? Really? I took it back and got something better.
3,"Good as a tuner, but not as a metronome","I like the accuracy of the tuner, and it ""hears"" my acoustic guitar quite well if I put it on the music stand so that it's angled toward me. As a metronome, however, it leaves much to be desired: (1) the volume is not adjustable and I consider it not loud enough, (2) it makes a cheesy electronic chirp instead of a mechanical-sounding knock as some of the electronic metronomes can, and (3) the rhythm is ""dotted,"" i.e., it puts a milder electronic chirp in between the ""main chirps"" and there's no way to turn it off (but this can be somewhat remedied by setting it to 1-4 time)."
3,"Average tuner, useless metronome","The tuning capability is only mediocre; the ""Accu-Pitch"" function might better be sold as ""Approxi-Pitch."" When I check my 2 TU-80 tuners against a high-end one, I find that the Accu-Pitch beep can sound as much as 5 cents out of tune, which is bad enough so that I have to retune.As far as the metronome goes, as other reviewers have noted, it's just not loud enough to be anything but a toy. Too bad, too - there was an opportunity to send the metronome signal out of the output jack, so that it could have driven an earphone, or could have been fed into a mixer, which was a choice that Boss itself made in its much-superior DB-12 metronome, but absent that feature, this metronome can't be used as an aid for practicing any real-world instrument."
2,Doesn't work with background noise.,"Works great in a quiet room. When I used it at a performance at a pub the ambient noise renders the tuner useless. Even with a plug-in clip-on mic on the instrument it did not register the note reliably. When this happened I would borrow a Yamaha TD-10 from my guitarist which worked great w/o a plug-in mic. I've since sold the TD-10 and bought a new Yamaha TD-10, which is sadly discontinued."
2,operating the metronome is badly designed.,"One of the most annoying things when using the TU-80 as a metronome is the way you have to select the tempo. You'd assume this would be the number one function on a metronome, but no, you have to push the ""select"" button three times before you can change the tempo: the first click selects the rythm, the second one the meter, and then, finally, the third one selects the tempo function. Then you need to push the up/down buttons to change it. Why all this hassle when all I want is a simple click per beat?What a difference with the 'large round knob' variety... where you simply turn the knob to change the BPM.A second, minor gripe is that you can't switch off the 'in-tune beep'; while it is often a handy thing to have, sometimes it's annoying.And indeed, the tuner has a hard time when there's background noise. I feel like a grumpy old man when I need to ask the members of the band to be quiet because I want to tune my bass. Every time again..."
2,Okay tuner but pointless metronome,This tuner is alright. It works best in quiet environment. I used this tuner to help when tuning my acoustic guitar. I exchanged it for another tuner. Now I regret it. Sometimes I have to pluck the strings especially the high e several times to get it to register. I was confused with how to use the metronome. It had things like 0/4 1/4 etc. I didn't get that. The metronome was strange because it did not display time signatures . Also the beep sound was unusual for a metronome.
2,Not A Sufficient Metronome,"I'm usually a big fan of the BOSS company and their products. I have one of their more advanced metronomes (Dr. Beat) and used to have their smaller metronome (DB-55 I think) before I left it backstage at the Library of Congress. Even though I usually avoid products that are both Tuners and Metronomes because they rarely deliver two good products in one, I went with this because I thought it'd be better. The Metronome is USELESS. WHY? Because there is no volume control whatsoever. The worst thing is that the volume that the metronome sounds is like a little toy soldier beating his mini baton on his mini stand. It's so soft that it's embarrassing that they even incorporated it. The tuner function seems decent although I haven't used it extensively."
5,An accurate look at birthparent grief,"So many birthmothers, grieving in the aftermath of the surrender of their child, say, ""Where can I find books that help me deal with the loss? Everything on adoption is geared toward adoptive parents."" This little booklet is a godsend for women who have just relinquished. Romanchik, a birthmother herself, succinctly and accurately describes birthparent grief and steps toward healing. I recommend this pamphlet for anyone who has placed a child with an adoptive family."
1,Save your money!,The names of the singers can not be found on the CD... for good reason! There are many excellent Lloyd Webber CDs. This is not one of them.
1,Read this before you buy this CD,"I'm astonished that Andrew Lloyd Webber ever gave his permission for this CD to be released! It is awful, there are some tracks that sound like they were done on somebody's Casio keyboard in their bedroom. If you buy this CD you WILL BE SORRY! As a matter of fact I'm seriously thinking of contacting Mr. Webber's orginization to see if they have heard this travesty."
3,Precipice: Mystery Novel or Textbook?,"Pollock successfully combines relevant issues of supply chain management into a book that reads more like a thriller than a textbook. While it doesn't fully accomplish either the intellectual endowment of a textbook or the heart-racing suspense of an exceptional thriller, the novel combines elements of each form in a unique manner to afford the reader an impression of both realms of literature. Whereas many other authors attempt to write one or the other, Pollock gives the reader a taste of each. While Pollock's work does have its shortcomings, he does what many novelists have yet to try. Perhaps his amalgamation of literatures will lead to a revolutionary kind of textbook, which will replace the monotonous readings students everywhere are currently facing. And, then again, maybe this is just one exhausted student's nave desire."
5,Perfect Ice Pack for Bottles,This ice pack is specially designed to fit into the Medela cooler that comes with the breast pumps and cozies in between 4/5 oz bottles. Works perfectly to keep breast milk chilled until you can get to the fridge.
4,Fun with plastic.,Some more great fun. The same cool graphics and challenging play you would expect from the Army Men series. I can never get enough. Cool new weapons and landscapes. A definite for true fans of the series. It won't let you down.
1,not nearly as good as Army Men II,"Months after having purchased it, I still can't stop playing Army Men II. That's a good thing, because the sequel, Army Men: Toys in Space, is not nearly as good a game. The graphics aren't as detailed and are, instead, round-edged and cartoony, and the control-action is much less fluid than the earlier version. It's a great idea -- putting the green army up against sci-fi toys -- but it's a lame game."
3,Army Men Toys In Space,"I had great expectations for this game; Sarge and the Green forces team up with Tina Tomorrow and the Galactic Army to end the threat of the Aliens. Using new technologies and new weapons, Sarge was supposed to win the day.The game itself was a disappointment. The game was short for the hype and there was a distinct lack of story development. Still, the new features were worth playing, and it is always fun to see Plastro lose."
3,Bland and mediocre,"I don't know what I am going to do if another Army Men game is to be released. Whatever humor was in the original, after six sequels I'd think that the jokes already came across. Alas, we are presented with Toys in Space.TiS is a classic follow-up to a popular game. It features degraded graphics, sound, and content. Whereas Army Men II had substance, Toys in Space took a one-line concept and blew it into a full-scale game. The graphics are jagged at the edges, and all the units look like they were put through a frame saw. This will notbe too successful."
4,"great picture, very good service","Dec 23, 2005I purchased the daewoo dp42sm plasma, had a small blue line through the picture. called the mfg...they issued a pick up authorization. Then I read the horror stories that this column wrote, got scared that I would be treated the same way.I experienced none of the problems listed in this review of comments. They replaced my unit with a new unit as they said they would. I was finished with the process just under 2.5 weeks. I don't know what made the difference, but the experience was not as bad as I was made to believe.A happy customer --- with my plasma tv back in the great room!"
4,Buyer Beware,"Although I bought this plasma because I liked the very sharp and clear picture, it has a common problem that I didn't discover until recently.There was a ""pop"" sound then the picture went black. I have spent the last 30 days with Best Buy and the Daewoo trying to get a new television. I have had the plasma for one year and did purchase the extended warranty. The service tech says that it cannot be repaired but the manufacturer will not respond and Best Buy does not want to give up a new set until they hear from Daewoo. Nice tv, lousy service from Best Buy and Daewoo."
3,Functional piece of junk,"This adapter works exactly like it ought to. However, on the one I got, the male end sticks out at a slightly odd angle. Inserting cables into the adapter or the adapter into something else has a bad feel to it, it's like it's too tight but without a corresponding feeling of durability. I would be kind of surprised if this thing lasted very long, but, for a dollar, I don't really care.In conclusion, if you are going to use this for a casual application, it'll work fine, go for it. If you need something truly reliable, be wary."
1,Horrible Product,"The headphone splitter is poorly crafted. You have to force your headphones into it and force it into your electronic device, which could harm both your phones and the device you're using them on. Save your two dollars and buy something that is made better. On top of having to force your equipment into it, you have to turn the piece to get it to evenly distribute sound into your headphones. Terrible product. I wouldn't buy it again, that's for sure."
4,Cables To Go Splitter Working As Expected,"So far I am happy with this 3.5mm splitter...I'm using it to split my older computer's audio-out between the speakers and headphones. It's working as expected with no loss of sound/quality and now giving me the use of headphones when I don't want to disturb others or vice versa.The quality is quite decent for this type product although the male jack does not snugly snap-in easily and the female jacks seem to be a bit tight. Neither is a major issue for my purposes...this may be a problem for those who plug and unplug this splitter often, possibly causing damage to the internal connections."
1,"Terrible product, never worked","This product only works with one pair of headphones at a time, meaning it's absolutely useless. Didn't work right out of the box. Complete waste of money. Buy from another company that makes products that actually work."
1,Cheap price for cheap quality.,"I understand that I purchased this for roughly $3 but I expected better from such a simple looking product. Of the two 3.5mm holes, only one of the holes secured my headphone in it. If I put my headphone in the other hole, it could fall out way too easily. Not only did I find that the holes were unreliable, the sound that was outputted on from both holes was only from the left side. There are way better choices to purchase that give a bit of a cord extension and only cost at most, $2 more than this splitter cost."
2,I'll get another one ASAP,"For some reason, I'm pretty sure it has to do with price, I have to turn around (like a knob) the cables that are plugged in to the jack to get the audio out correctly. Sometimes no audio comes out, just an annoying sound & sometimes the audio is there, but you can't hear certain aspects like say the siging (really low)"
3,very low volume output because of split,It does the job great sturdy and durable but honestly get a amplifier because you will lose half of your volume output
2,Spring for a pricier splitter,"Out of the package, one of the two female ends had absolutely no grip on a 3.5mm plug. (The other female end worked just fine, though.) I'm being generous with the second star because I can't imagine that a build quality issue is a universal problem with this thing. But really, when I was expecting a cheap, convenient adapter, I didn't expect it to be _that_ cheap on manufacturing quality. Given that other solutions for 3.5mm connection sharing are only a few dollars more, I think it's worth it for 90% of people out there to ""splurge"" with a different adapter. To the 10%: be forewarned if you think this thing is adequate, because you're rolling dice on something which plainly has little or no quality control."
4,Does the job,"Got this splitter in a few hours ago. I'm using it to split a 1/4"" headphones out from an external sound card for DJing, since there are two of us and sharing headphones had become a problem (1/4"" to 3.5mm adapter to 2 x 3.5mm). The only (relative) downside I've noticed is that it takes a bit of force to plug the headphones into the adapter. At first, I thought I had ordered the wrong item, but with slight force, it snapped right in. Seems like a good thing for my application as it makes a secure connection and I won't have to worry about my phones coming unplugged."
2,Low Quality- Not for RECORDING,"This item is low-consumer grade, and not surprising based on the cost. The use I needed it for was to split an audio out from the ZOOM H4n to , a/ monitor headphones and b/to record to another device (digital camera mic in). The H4n was used to adjust mic gain, with a dual (high quality) XLR mics. This splitter produced excessive noise on the subsequent recording."
2,not that great,this product is incredibly inconvenient to try to plug it in a plug that isnt completely straight and it doesnt even work that good..... defiantly o.k.
1,You're Being Screwed,"You don't get whats in the picture!!! What you get is a different cheaper item, which is a piece of junk!!!"
1,the.... thing or whatever it's called,"GOD, this thing SUCKS!!! First time i plugged it in and no sound would come out equally through either port. Failed the first time. BOTH ports failed to provide sound equally through both earphones. Not even moving it around would help. Only holding it in ridiculous positions would the sound come out only decently through both ports. Not worth it. This thing was cheap as hell so i don't regret buying it since i payed just over one dollar and no shipping costs whatsoever. No loss to me.DO NOT bother buying this! Not even worth one star."
1,Crap,I purchased this adapter because it comes in handy. The cost didn't bother me because it was such a simple item that I didn't think someone could screw it up but I received the item and only one of the jacks produces audio. It just doesn't work and therefore I have given it the appropriate 1-star rating.
1,worked then was really loose,"plugged a jack in into it, was a good fit then after that i had to tape it in because the jack wouldnt stay"
3,"sing songy, but gets a little tired","Take the late 70's Beach Boys, a minor dash of early Dead and a little something extra and you get the Thrills. I can see how a band like this can be easy to hate (i.e. Strokes) But damnnit, it's good. I keep replaying the first two songs over and over, though by the second time I knew the lyrics. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but what the Thrills give us are songs we can sing along to with our friends on that road trip up the coast. Philosophy wise, they're closer to Jack Johnson in that respect. The only down side is by the seventh or eight track I start to lose interest. If you don't take them so serious, I think you'll like them."
3,interesting!,"With touches of U2, Ash, JJ72, and even the Corrs you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a bona-fide Irish rock debut. Strange then that the Thrills actually hail from Southern California! Rarely have a band taken another country's style and made it so convincingly their own, but it's a good trip none the less."
2,"Um, sorry, no....","...it's just not that good. I tried. Was recommended this album by a friend and heard the buzz. Sometimes buzz is worthy (The Shins) sometimes not. This album left me hollow. The affected contrived singing, a lack of strong melodies. It's kind of lazy. And the western US references get tired."
2,* The Thrills - Not So Thrilling *,"I'd heard ""Big Sur"" and ""Don't Steal Our Sun"" and I was quite impressed. They were catchy and upbeat, with a very unique sound. But when I listened to their album, I was not so impressed.All the songs on this album sound exactly the same. There's no variety. And if you like their sound, I think you'll like this, but it is quite boring.And at the end, they add a very long song. Filler? Oh...I think not...This album falls short. Seriously short."
3,Some comparisons to annoy people,"How bout...Promise Ring (singer's voice)meets Pavement (occasional thrills quirkiness albeit not nearly as much as Pavement), meets the guitar pop/harmonies of sloan (when they were good).Thats just what I hear.Best Song: Big Sur-Adios"
4,End It!,"We're living in lucky times. This kind of sunny day pop had no outlet just a few years ago. Thank god the music business seems to be growing up a bit.The Shins, School for the Dead, Fountains of Wayne, The Decemberists, even Iron and Wine fans will eat up this delicious pop-cake.Break out the tamborine and acoustic guitar and roll down your car window. This is the music of the new generation."
3,Better than most but incomplete,"Like so many albums these days, this one is front-loaded, with the better and more completely-produced songs at the beginning and the degree of finish tapering off as you go. Why they didn't spend the time to make the whole thing equally ""good,"" I'll never know. Anyhow, the melodies are catchy, and the gimmicky production is fetching. Better than 95 percent of the music I've been connected to through Amazon. The recording on some of the songs is quite crystalline, with very clear sonic placement and character. An unusual choice of voicings and locations in the harmonies adds a mysterious appeal."
5,Nosalgia,"I love these Irish guys! I don't like a lot of 'new' music, but this band, like The Shins and Keane, are some of the few bands that have the quality as well as the catchiness to be on the radio today.This music, even when in the background, puts a smile on my face. Who doesn't want to hear more surf-rock? Who has really done it justice since the Beach Boys. Well these guys definitely have that spirit in them. You can hear it in the music.Call it a nostalgia from remembering ""The Monkees"" and ""Flipper"" on tv Sunday mornings, or just letting it all hang out on the beach. At the same time this band takes nostalgia and rides with it instead of using it as a prop or something.Listen to it when the sun is in your face and the wind is in your hair..or at night by a campfire and tiki torches..there's no better music for it;-)"
3,It is a start,"I listened to ""Let's Bottle Bohemia"" first and now I am trying to get into this album but am having a very difficult time with it. Overall, there is a repetitious feel to it and I am really turned off by the country sounding songs. Try LBB first!"
3,Dublin + Neil Young + California =,"I finally ended up getting this because I really liked ""One Horse Town"", and while that song is a highpoint of the disc, it's all good, and pretty consistent. It's hard to say whether their sound is mellow garage-rock, alt-country, or otherwise, but it doesn't really matter, because the whole album is just fun, and a great listen. ""Big Sur"" is another strong song, and there's a hidden track as well. In short, if you've heard anything from this album, you should know what to expect. I'm glad I got ""So Much For The City"", and I think it would go well with some ""Deckchairs and Cigarettes""."
4,Thrilled,"It's a shame I had to go all the way to London to hear The Thrills for the first time. The sound is pure Southern California. ""So Much For the City"" is the perfect music for kicking back with your friends with a few cold ones in the summer sun. If you're looking to escape all the punk/metal/pop one-hit-wonders that dominate the radio airwaves, this CD is for you.You can hear The Thrills' influences, but their music is still original...especially compared to today's MTV-manufactured [stuff]. Standouts include ""One Horse Town"" (should be a U.S. single), ""Big Sur"" (reminds me of early R.E.M.) ""Don't Steal Our Sun"" (Beatles-esque), ""Armchairs and Cigarettes"" and ""Say It Ain't So"" (great steel guitar).Bands like The Thrills (and especially Gomez) could be big over here if their record companies pushed for them like Radiohead's and Coldplay's do. Here's hoping a few big U.S. radio stations give them the chance they deserve."
3,I need/hate/offer comparisons,"I can't believe that guy didn't see Beach Boys in this (more specifically Brian Wilson),but I'll admit what of them is in there is pretty much 3rd generation (or more). Same with Beatles comps. Alt country? Alt country instrumental flourishes don't necessarily make alt-country music. Previous references I can see: Beulah, Beechwood Sparks, a little Jayhawks. Ones I don't get: Galaxy 500,Eagles,Gram Parsons. To my ears, its alotta Fountains of Wayne and High LLamas. Post-post-pop pop. Not bad. Better than much. A for effort. I may buy it."
1,i've tried...,"I want to enjoy this cd. I really do. But, every time I listen I hate it even more. I have a policy that I never throw, trade, or give away a cd. So, it'll stay and maybe somebody will come over some day and say, ""Hey you got the Thrills cd? I love this cd. Can I listen?"" And I'll say, ""Sure, go ahead."" And somebody will get some enjoyment out of this putrid piece of garbage.Maybe the next time I try listening to it I'll have a change of heart. It certainly can't get any worse, can it?"
1,so much for the thrills,"I normally try and look for positives when I review a CD, but I seriously couldn't find any here.This CD is devoid of hooks, originality, and feeling. I was drawn to this over the hype about a Beach Boys influence on the CD. Wow how not true is that comparison.Each song just flows into another giving without change, I hardly noticed actually.So I regret being so negative, maybe all the hoopla had me to hyped"
5,Tyler Perry Collection a must-have for your family!,"My family and I have been fans of Tyler Perry since seeing our first Madea video borrowed from a friend several years ago. When I saw this set, I had to have it. He speaks the language of families and has much better subject matter and language in his productions than many my family could see elsewhere. We are making plans to see his latest production ""What's Done In The Dark"" live, and know it will be worth it. Get this set for your DVD library - you won't regret it!"
2,Falsely Advertised,"Although I thought these were very funny and enjoyed them, nothing on the boxed set or information tells you that they are not actual movies. They are stage plays. I bought on Tyler Perry's reputation for his humor and didn't realize I wasn't getting real movies. Somewhere in the description it should be noted that these are plays and not movies."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed in this purchase. There was no information to tell you that you were ordering plays and not movies.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this box set expecting 4 Tyler Perry movies. What I got was a collection of 4 live-action plays, NOT movies. Nowhere in the product description does it make it clear to the consumer that these are not movies. Deceptive, to say the least! I will say, however, that Amazon was very accommodating when I called to complain. They made the return process very easy."
1,Tyler Perry Collection,"Not at all as expected, a complete waste of money. I expected it to be on the order of the movie, ""The Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". Instead they are all plays, not movies, and hard to understand."
1,Tyler Perry 4 Play DVD Collection,I returned this item after a very disappointing surprise. They are not the actual movies they are plays on a stage. The details of the items are misinforming.
1,"thought they were the movies, dissappointed to find out they were the plays",When these were ordered I thought they were movies not plays I would not have bought them (especially at the price I paid) had I known. Rose Finizio rfinizio@rochester.rr.com
1,Tyler Perry Collection,Very Poor quality videos. Not as advertised. Did not say in ad that it was a stage play that was recorded.
5,I love Tyler Perry and his plays! Totally awesome!,Love the plays! They are great! Tyler Perry is awesome and I am glad I was able to get these for a reasonable price. 4 plays for less than $9 each!
5,Great Product!,"I had lost one of my sherpa sleeves and had put it on my dog without it. She's a puller, and she ended up rubbing the undersides of her front legs raw. I felt really bad about that. I would highly recommend buying these replacement sleeves in order to make your dog comfortable."
3,good product,"i did not like the clasp it to me is backwards,but the actual strength of it was what i expected"
1,heavy cable with junk hardware,"got this delivered on friday and installed on saturday. installed between two 10' posts at 6'6"" high so we could still mow, etc... under it. our 6 month old german shepherd at 62 lbs. spent a total of 7 to 8 hours on it before the screw that attaches the pulley to the pivot hardware fell out (sunday). i fixed that (sunday as well) with some extra hardware i had here and added a jam nut so it would still pivot but not fall apart again. it is now the tuesday and the lightweight pulley is starting to stick in places so when the dog runs it will catch and then let go in random areas. bottom line is that while the cable may put up with the abuse of a 250 lb. dog, the hardware is no match for a 62 lb. puppy. you may want to look at some local farm supply stores for a heavier duty solution."
1,Dog on the loose!,"I puchased this chain to replaced a 30ft cable I previously owned that snapped due to wear, I had this one for about a week and today my neighbor is driving towards my house with my staffordshire terrier (pit bull) running behind her car....luckily she's owned a pit and was not afraid of my dog. Nevertheless, he was able to escape and it could have turned out far worse!!!"
1,"dissatisfied -- the unit doesn't allow a smooth, quick draw","I have several Uncle Mike's products so it was natural to select another for my new Glock G26. I ordered the size 12 from Amazon and it was promptly delivered. The unit is nicely finished and the weapon fits securely but, perhaps, too securely. I've fiddled with the adjustment screws and adjusted the tilt of the holster relative to the paddle and I cannot get a smooth, consistent draw. A key problem is that some draws are easy and smooth and others I end up practically pulling the holster out of my pants. In addition, the adjustability of the holster is limited and tedious with small machine screws which must be entirely removed from the holster to adjust the tilt a very small amount. Bottom line: I've already printed out a return receipt and it's going back. This unit may work for other folks but not for me."
5,Great melancholy masterpiece,"Already when I hear the first seconds of this song, that synth bassline melody, immediately that delighted but deeply melancholic feeling will run through my veins... this is such a special song!You can just feel past summers, past loves... I think this song is very powerful."
4,"a lovely opera, wonderfully performed","I agree fully with C Boerger's thoughtful review of Mascagni's L'Amico Fritz, in every particular. This is a magnificent and thoroughly professional performance of an opera that should be far better known than it is. The disc has good English subtitles.My only caveat is that the singers were not very well miked for the recording, so that they frequently tend to fade into the background. Still, I heartily recommend this DVD. For more even sound engineering, I also suggest an excellent CD performed by Luciano Pavarotti and Mirella Freni, with Gianandrea Gavazzeni conducting the Royal Opera House Orchestra; this is Amazon's ASIN B00004VVZL. The different media complement each other for a full appreciation of the opera."
3,For Theodossiou's fans,"I'm so frustrated by the sound there. Actors' voices are so remote. In addition, one can easily spot out who's reading from the prompter, especially the gypsy boy. But, all can be compensated if one's Theodossiou's fan, and I am. Thus, I'm so happy to enjoy her adorable performance."
2,Mascagni's own opera,"Mascagni wrote many ""operas."" There is doubt that he wrote Cavalleria Rusticana, but L'Amico Fritz is his. After Cav, he never found melody again; therefore the doubt. Much of Cav sounds like Puccini orcehestrated it, and there are snippets of Puccini's Le Villi in it. Mascagni was crowned King of Verismo for an opera he might not have written. L'Amico Fritz is a pleasant little trifle with little action or melody."
4,Good Grip,"The ball is a ball... easy to hold on to, throw and even bounce. Since it is 12lbs it makes a lot of noise when bounced. The disk that came with it wasn't worth watching if you do not have a partner to catch the ball or a brick/sturdy wall to throw against."
1,Not what I expected,Was disappointed in this product. It was not what I expected. Was looking for a L'Oreal product that had dermabrasion and this is not it.
4,"Please Read: Good for a ""Before Shave"" Cleanser NOT for Acne","This is an excellent cleanser no doubt, and a pretty decent ""before shave"" face wash.The thing is it is NOT for clearing acne or helping prevent breakouts. It does read ""Use daily to clear blemishes"" etc., but it is not the best facial cleanser for acne.If you do have acne, I would recommend NEUTROGENA RAPID CLEAR FACE WASH.Just use a shaving foam, shave, and THEN cleanse (with a follow up moisturizer).The idea of cleansing and then shaving with a shaving foam is not ideal for acne."
5,I credit this book for my son being so well behaved,"My dad gave me this book when my son was a baby. I read it several times and started using the ideas as soon as my soon could understand the word ""no,"" about 9 months. Used the tips to help keep him safe by knowing boundaries. As my son grew, I adapted the ideas in the book per his age. I appreciated that the book focuses on loving and clear boundaries, and small rewards, not harsh discipline. Thanks to the ideas in this book (and perhaps genetics), my son has only had about six tantrums in his life. He is now almost 7, and a nice child who is well behaved and polite. Not perfect, of course, but knows how to control himself and does not whine or yell. I buy the book for all my friends who have kids... if only they would read it. If you are looking for a kind way to read kind children, please buy this book. I honestly think the whole world would be better if every parent had a copy. Also makes a great present for new parents."
2,Remmington R-825.,This razor does not live up to it's advertizing. I used it to shave my head so it needs to be sharp and not irritate the skin. I used it for a month to make sure I gave it a fair chance. It continued to bother my skin and it was very uncomfortable to hold. Who would design a razor so that you would hold it on pointed corners? I gave up on it and went back to the Norelco. This one went to goodwill.
1,Caused horrible rash.,"My husband used this razor once, and he had a horrible rash. Seller did email me after I told him what happened and said he would let me return it for a stocking fee. Don't know how much that will be as I have not heard from them. Getting a little worried that I might not get the refund."
1,Cheap and not just inexpensive,This was used on a small dog who kept pulling it out of the ground. The ring that is supposed to spin to avoid tangling bent instantly and nearly snapped off. Total waste of money.
1,"Ok, What happened here?","First of all I'm a HUGE R.E.M. fan since early '85. This is REM at their weakest. I am still stunned at how people can call this a masterpiece. After the so-so ""Green"" album , I was highly anticipating this release back in '91. I had heard ""Losing my religion"" beforehand on the radio which I think is a good (but not great) song. So I thought there was some promise there. How wrong was I? The first track on this cd ""Radio song"" is downright scary!! I almost felt embarrased for the band. The rest of this cd wonders down the road of mediocrety at best. If you're wanting to taste the ""True"" R.E.M., I suggest trying ""Life's Rich pageant"" and ""Document"". Those are good starters. If you want the best R.E.M. album, (in most people's opinion including mine) try out ""Murmur"". Luckly, after this ""Out of time"" disappointment, ""Automatic for the people"" came out and restored my faith in R.E.M. once again. Don't get this!"
2,REM sells Out!,"This is by far my least favorite album by the boys. I thought then and still do today, that it was a wannabe commercial, sell-out recording. It lacked the soul of their earlier albums and the innovation of their later albums. This is a great band, but they dropped the ball on this one. Too sappy!"
2,an album with one song...,"There is no song that is listenable more than twotimes except for ""loosing my religion"".This recordindebted all its celebrity to this song.It is like a single..."
2,"""Out of Form""","REM hooked listeners into 'Out of Time' with ""Losing My Religion"" and you either bought the album because you wanted to hear that song in particular or you were hoping all the songs were similar to it if you hadn't heard it before. ""Out of Time"" is pretty much a set of ho-hum little ditties with a jewel thrown in. What gets me is, if a band can construct a masterpiece like 'Religion' for an album, how can they bring themselves to compose really-oh-so-boring music...perhaps they saved the quality for ""Automatic For The People"" which is their best, and a superior, creation. Two stars for the jewel."
2,Shiny Happy Garbage,"For someone like me who had been onboard the REM Express since the early days, ""Out of Time"" served as my cue to now exit the train. As if enlisting the help of KRS-One on ""Radio Song"" wasn't bad enough (no disrespect to KRS, BDP were fantastic in their own right and you were simply helping REM put lipstick on a pig), Stipe and the boys dragged a B-52 onboard for ""Shiny Happy People"". What resulted was the band's most pathetic recording to date. If this album represents your first exposure to REM and you liked what you heard, then pay no attention to this review or any REM records prior to ""Green"". However if you cut your teeth on ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""Seven Chinese Brothers"", then don't be alarmed when blood pours out of your ears after listening to this album...the very definition of a ""Traveshamockery""."
1,Garbage,"When I heard the brilliant ""loosing my religion"" single in 91' I was instantly hooked on REM. Commercial success followed. Unfortunately apart from that , this disc offers the biggest load of mediocre garbage that I've heard in ages. It was really hard not ejecting the disc. I haven't heard many REM albums but I'll make a guess and say that this is the worst."
1,The newer the better.,"If you want to see how REM developed into the great band they are today, go ahead. But I was very disappointed with this album. I hate to say anything bad about them because I love their music so much, but I really hate this album. I own it, but in all honesty I never listen to it. That's why the rating is a little harsh. It's not that I haven't tried. Even the other day I gave it another listen, but I simply don't like it and don't see why everyone else does. Their new music is so much better."
3,Sweet album,"I like this cd but the song shiny happy people just irratates me so much (cant be helped), the best track on the album is losing my religion even though it was played over and over again and still is in records shops etc, it's worth picking up though."
5,A timeless and emotional album,"This is the REM album that really made them popular, this is a more commercial album than the previous ones. But it's clear for me that it's also one of their best, if not THE best REM. The band is still young and has still very much to offer.The song ""Losing my religion"" is the most famous and it's sure the album wouldn't have been so good without it. But ""Out of time"" is not ONLY ""Losing my religion"". And though not heard on the radio, the songs ""Texarkana"", ""half a world away"", ""country feedback"" are a real pleasure to listen.Sure, there are some negative points : the songs ""belong"" and ""endgame"" are simply too boring. But it's nothing compared to the great voice of Michael Stipe, which is in my opinion at its best point. The guitars are very listenable, which is not the case of later albums following ""automatic for the people""."
4,My First REM Album,"I bought this album in 1991, mainly because ""Losing My Religion"" was on the radio, and not only was it a radio hit, it was actually a great song! I liked the album from the first, although there were parts (like ""Endgame"",""Belong"" and ""Texarkana"") where the vocals and/or strings seemed a bit overly sweet to me. But I like them now. But I've never really warmed much to ""Me in Honey"". Not that it's bad, but it's not very interesting, musically. But although ""Shiny Happy People""'s lyrics may be off-putting to some, they're nice enough to me, and it sure is catchy. Better though are ""Low"", with its moody organ, and ""Half a World Away"" a harpsichord-driven number that is simply one of REM's best. I have also grown to love ""Near Wild Heaven"". ""Country Feedback"" is a great track too, with more moody organ and loud guitar making a fine backdrop to the exasperated lyrics."
5,THE Winner! From K,I accumulated all the REM U.S. releases and this was by far my favorite. It's an album you can listen to over and over without having to skip various tracks.
5,Perhaps the best REM album ever!,"This album is by far the best of all of REM's efforts! The first album after Green, which launched them into the big time, this is full of hits. Losing My Religion, Near Wild Heaven, Shiny Happy People, Belong, and Me In Honey really shine! If you liked Green, you'll love Out Of Time."
3,Too much pop for me,"I got this album in my junior year in college. I remember thinking to myself at that time, ""FINALLY!"". I had been very disappointed with the previous two REM releases (Document and Green)since becoming a fan of the group in 1985. Well, I think I spoke too soon, because unlike some of REM's others work, I discovered that the songs start to wear thin really quick. Many songs on this collection are too overtly poppy (""Near Wild Heaven"" and ""Shiny Happy People""). You can only hear those songs a dozen or so times before getting sick to the stomach.I must concede that I still like ""Losing My Religion"" quite a bit, even though it has been the victim of radio overplay. Another song that I think deserves kind mention is ""Me in Honey"". I just love the driving rhythm, and Kate Pierson's vocals complement the song nicely."
4,Very Good,"Well, opinion certainly seems divided on this one. Actually, this is the last album R.E.M. released that I like, and I've been a fan since 1983. I think ""Automatic"" has some fine songs, but is ultimately overrated. I like the production on this album alot more. It's bright and detailed, and the arrangements are interesting, with lots of neat instruments popping up. It kind of reminds me of a Beatles album. I also must admit to liking the much maligned ""Shiny, Happy People"" quite abit, in spite of the ridiculous lyrics. I play the bass guitar, and it's a fun song to play along with."
3,It's ok,"Let me say one thing, ""Losing my Religion"" is one of the best songs I've EVER heard. It completely overshadows the rest of the album. It was the true hit of '91 (yeah you heard me Cobain). But the rest just isn't that great, really. There's nothing terrible, just nothing compares to this song. And you know, Michael Stipe isn't really a guy you wanna pattern yourself after."
5,AWESOME !,"awesome 5.1 surround sound mix. I have listened to the cd hundreds of times ,however the dvd a version is like hearing the album for the first time again, only in 5.1. !! Highly recommended!"
5,another satisfied customer,"Real good cd. Arrived on time,no scratches.Plays excellent.You can't go wrong with R.E.M (good job)could of bought 2 for good price,a hard to find cd.."
5,"An Incredible Album, one of REM's Best!","This is probably REM's second best album right after the brialliant ""Automatic for the People"". I loved every song on it. Althought this is more of a ""happy"" album than a serious one like ""automatic"" was - it is still just as great. This is a must-have as well."
5,R.E.M. changes direction,"As opposed to Green, an accessible pop album, Out of Time forces introspection, with great songs ""Half a World Away"" and ""Country Feedback."" Mike Mills and Kate Pierson help lighten the mood on ""Near Wild Heaven,"" ""Shiny Happy People,"" and ""Me In Honey."" Definitely one of R.E.M's best."
3,"Good, for a new REM listener, but hardly mesmerizing","I ""like"" REM, but there is so much better ""reflective"" or intellectual rock out there...This is a good album, with some real moving lyrics and lyrical music. Just can't figure out how an angst-ridden generation reflected by an angst-ridden band could produce so MANY angst-ridden albums. Listen to this, because it's good (not great), then kick back, have a beer, and throw on some Stones or Cherry Poppin Daddies or Kansas or, hell, even Dean Martin, and cheer up."
3,In Time On Out Of Time,"REM has always and will always keep in time with their music. This smash album has the number one hit LOSING MY RELIGION. SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE and ME IN HONEY has the band's employed guest Kate Pierson of the B-52's. Like any other band,REM needed to vocally cool down with ENDGAME. There are no sung words on BELONG. The words heard are spoken. One of the top-selling albums in 1991."
3,"Nothing special, but not too bad either","This isn't a bad album, but nothing too special. ""Losing My Religion"" was a mega-hit, and probably the only song on this album that I can play more than once. The other tracks didn't really catch my fancy, but if you're into their type of music, it isn't all that bad. This was an album that I decided to buy mainly for that one track (""Losing My Religion""), so there isn't much else to celebrate."
2,REM at their worst...to this point anyway,"Wow I hadn't thought about this album for awhile and decided to take a look at what people had said about it over the years. I'm shocked by all the positive reviews. I think it's god awful from a band I really loved at one point. The songs are trite, the production is made for pop sensibilities and the band had lost it's edge. Now you want REM at their peak? My choice would be Reckoning or Fables of the Reconstruction. this one doesn't come close."
2,Remember when these guys were good?,"So R.E.M.'s breakthrough turns out to be completely inconsequential after all, with a couple exceptions: the massively catchy ""Radio Song"", folk-rocker ""Me in Honey"" (though I don't like the droning backup vocals), ""Near Wild Heaven"", sung by Mike Mills, and especially the inescapable hit ""Losing My Religion"", with an infinite number of hooks. But this album is equally inclined to wallow in miserable lite folk-rock like ""Half a World Away"", ""Low"" or ""Belong"". And this is the one with the detestable, brain-dead ""Shiny Happy People"", a truly sickening example of what commercial R.E.M. could become. It's hard for me to believe that this is the album most associate with the group..."
4,More hits from R.E.M!,"R.E.M. doesn't lose the touch with this album. Like Automatic for the people it has some calm songs, but there is also another touch on it. The woman that sings with Stipe here is very good."
2,The long slide continues......,"Sadly, this is one of the band's weaker efforts. Their songwriting in the '80s has dwarfed their feeble '90s output, and it's increasingly looking like this is a group that should have hung it up in, say, 1987. Fave track: Me In Honey."
2,Down,"Now that we're all musing over 'Up!' and whether it's any good or not (and I think it's good), I decided to pop over to the 'Out of Time' review and acknowledge the most god-awful REM album to date. Ironically, it's not that the songs are too bad, they just don't gel AT ALL. There are some great songs here - Me In Honey, Country Feedback, Texarkana, Belong, Half A World Away, but REM should never be forgiven for three of the most annoying songs of the nineites: Radio Song, Losing My Religion and Shiny Happy People. Four if you include Near Wild Heaven (Da da da da da da da da da yeah, yeah). This was the first REM album I ever bought, and it took me 2 years before I dared touch another. Then fortunately I bought the much maligned IRS collection 'The Best Of' in 1993 and found something a whole lot better. Has anybody noticed that 'Green' just gets better and better...?"
4,Happy Happy,"This album isn't too bad. It has one of the most famous and most played REM downbeat singles ""Losing My Religion"" which is a good song. ""Low"" the other kind of downbeat song goes well with the single. It has cool congas, organ, and dreary vocals from Stipe. These are two good downbeat gems from REM...ONe of the best parts of this album.""Near Wild Heaven"" and ""Shiny Happy People"" are my two other favorite songs. ""Near Wild Heaven"" features some great contributions on extra high vocals from Mike and Bill backing up Stipe which really give the song great pop edge. It almost seems like a 50's pop song or just maybe a Big Star song...both I guess. Shiny Happy People has strings and just is ultra catchy. With female backing vocals to add to Stipes and Buck still does the jangly thing on this track...it's great.Other Highlights=Radio Song, Me in Honey, Half a World Away."
2,REM's worst record? Sure!,"I'm a huge REM fan, but if it were somehow up to me I'd end this business about ""Out of Time"" being REM's best album. If you listen to REM's early records (namely, the first three) what you get is a group full of originality, with lyrical ambiguity, guitars that jangle, melodies that are timeless, and so forth.With ""Out of Time"" ironically, you get a record that is very much *not* timeless. In fact it's basically your typical radio pop ...! If REM could ever be accused of selling-out artistically, this is the one that did it. ""Green"", for me, was a hint of trouble to come, but ""Out of Time"" embodies everything that I don't like about REM. Somehow, they redeemed themselves with ""Automatic for the People"" and the very underrated ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi"", but ever since they're becoming more and more irrelevant. ..."
3,Not My Favorite R.E.M. CD,"I'm not much of an R.E.M. fan; I'm more of a casual listener. But when my sister was cleaning out her music collection, I was happy enough to take this CD off her hands, since I recognized a couple of the singles on it: #2, ""Losing My Religion"" (one I like), and #6, ""Shiny Happy People"" (one I don't). And that just about sums up my reaction to ""Out of Time""--a 50/50 like/dislike of the songs.The CD almost has a country feel to it, and since I'm not much a country fan, that's probably why I wasn't won over by this album. I still think Michael Stipe has a good singing voice, but it was nice to hear some accompaniment by Kate Pierson (from The B-52's) on songs like ""Shiny Happy People,"" ""Country Feedback,"" and ""Me In Honey.""Anyone who likes mellow, artsy alt rock with a hint of country will probably like ""Out of Time,"" but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this CD, unless you're a die hard R.E.M. fan."
3,Kind of disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, R.E.M. is and has been one of my favorite groups for years. But of the many CDs I have of theirs, this is the one I listen to the least. It does have some bright spots, like the deservingly famous ""Losing my Religion,"" and the lively ""Radio Song,"" but other than that, the rest of the tracks aren't as exceptional as what I'm used to hearing from this band. If you're going to buy one CD of theirs, buy Automatic for the People, which is much more representative of the beauty and talent that R.E.M. is capable of. And if you are looking for something earlier, try Green, which also features some excellent and memorable music."
1,The songs that made me hate REM for a long time,"I hate ""Losing My Religion"". Most of REM's tunes are sentimental to a certain degree, but this weepfest is downright whiny. And they should have been taken behind the barn and beaten for ""Shiny Happy People"". ""Radio Song"" is decent, but doesn't make up for the teeth-grinding badness of these two, and the other songs are mediocre at best. I was 14 when this album was released, and I had had no previous exposure to REM. This CD made me despise them as self-pitying blowhards for years. I have since come around, but the scars linger."
3,"Not their best, but a good CD.","Out of Time is often called the best REM album, but I disagree with this. Apart from Losing My Religion, which is one of my favourite songs ever, the album is not up to some of REM's other offerings. It's still a good album, with happy pop-rock melodic songs like `Radio Song' and `Shiny Happy People' and more depressed songs like the simple but effective `Low' but there is some filler, like `Near Wild Heaven' and `Me In Honey'. I suggest Automatic for the People as a better starting point for newcomers, as well as Monster and Up as looks into the more rocky (Monster) and experimental (Up) REM."
5,A true step forward for REM,"This album was the first of three great albums that REM made in the nineties. The popularity of ""Losing my religion"", ""Shiny Happy People"", and ""Near Wild Heaven"" made it the breakout album that put them at the forefront of popular music. Although some die-hard fans considered the album a sellout, I think this album covered a lot of new ground for the group. REM stepped away from their previuos sound, and took some risks. Just listen to the opening track ""Radio Song"", and you can tell that this is not your typical REM album. Heck, Michael Stipe even sounds happy during a few of the songs.Personally I like the diversity of the album, and think that any REM fan should own it. It is very strong. If you like the two albums that followed: Monster and Automatic for the People, you will definitely like this one."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Don't waste your time watching this movie. One of the worst ones I've seen. Sorry, not much else to add to that."
2,Disappointing,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought I'd take a chance on this one. I won't say it's terible, but even the best songs are marginally pleasing. Most of the rest are forgettable. It seems as if these songs are in need of something; a little more harmony, a better chorus, some guitar break. They don't quite hit the mark for me. And I don't really hear any Posies influence (as in a review herewith). Maybe potential, but not scaled on this album."
1,What ever happened to real rock and roll?,"Sometimes I sit back and think about the days when ""rock and roll"" was actually an acronym for sex. In this weak entry into the pop genre, testosterone driven power pop has been replaced by the castrato whinings of lead singer Zach Siskin. I scanned from track to track trying to find a new McCartney( or even a Peter Ham ), but instead I find ""Backstreet Boy"" mentality. Skip this one so pop can retain its power."
1,Nothing special,"This book is about what I expected-- an overview of things we've already heard. Anyone who remotely followed Barbaro's story through the media already knows everything written in this book. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past year, this isn't worth the read. This book almost seems a sacrilege to Barbaro and to those who loved and cared for him-- the author seems to be willing to paste the horse's name on a mediocre book for the sake of a quick dollar. Do yourself a favor and read 'real' racing literature, like Hillenbrand's ""Seabiscuit"" or Nack's ""Secretariat- The Making of a Champion."" A quick internet search on Barbaro will uncover better information by more talented writers."
1,Very Disappointed With This Book,"I was deeply disappointed with this book. Having followed Barbaro's recovery avidly on a daily basis, and having fallen in love with him, there is a hole in my heart now which cannot be filled. He will always remain a champion and will be remembered by all of those who loved him.Therefore, much to my dismay, I was disapointed, not only by the book's appearance and presentation, but the writing, the errors, the apparent haste in which the book was thrown together to be released quickly.I was looking forward to a really wonderful book, with photographs and a quality of writing and presentation that would be worthy in honoring this horse. I must say that my expectations were not met. I have returned the book to Amazon for a refund."
1,EXTREMELY Disappointed,"I waited to buy this book, knowing that I wasn't emotionally ready to read it. I eventually bought it when I bought W. Nack's Ruffian book and the book about Secretariat's groom. I read the other two books first, and then the Barbaro book. The Barbaro book is littered with mistakes. The editors did an extremely poor job. I realize that casual horseracing fans will probably enjoy the book and won't notice the errors, but there is sooo much missing from this book! I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is not a worthy remembrance of Barbaro, his connections and the fans worldwide who followed his story."
1,poor book for such a great horse,"What a poorly written book about such a fantastic horse. It is loaded with other obscure facts unrelated to the horse, trainer or story line. As a reader, we are forced to endure ""side trips"" as directed by the author which have nothing to do with the horse.Remember this horse was a spectacular race horse, but it is difficult to tell with this book! I would not recommend this book to anyone, except to the authors to revise this.Sad, such a poor tribute to such a great horse."
5,Thoughtful Story - Selfless heroes in a tragic time!,"The body of the text reveals the sheer power of the story. In these difficult times; (war, terror, stock market fluctuations etc.) courage, hope and faith are no longer common place. The book delivers a punch in its documentarian style and approach, laying the facts bare, the beating heart of the matter - love - putting in perspective an event so sad, yet inspiring and recent it still makes me cry! An inspiring book!!"
5,Great Book,Couldn't put this down once I started reading it! This magnificent horse touched so many lives. So it's nice to read more about him and get to know the people who were such a big part of his life!
1,Tough to read,"I would not recommend this book. I was so surprised by how poorly written it was that I actually came on Amazon to see how other people reacted to it. The writing is very hard to follow, with many mistakes. The book is definitely not for horse people, as even basic terminology is explained. Overall, I would say that this book leaves much to be desired."
2,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed when the camera arrived. It was large, clunky and unattractive. I did not try the camera, rather just sent it back. A definite case of you get what you pay for. Find something else!"
1,Adds nothing new to the subject,"The author has clearly put a lot of work into this book but unfortunately has added nothing new. He spends excessive amounts of time fantasizing about David's treasure and engaging in gross speculation. This is a Bible centered work that cannot see any options outside the confines of the Bible. The contradictions and improbabilities inherent in the Bible stories of David are not acknowledged. The possibility that David, if he existed, was an Egyptian Pharaoh appears never to have crossed the author's mind."
5,Abunai! - 'Universal Mind Decoder' (Camera Obscura),"About as outstanding as their 'Round Wound' CD (see my review). Top-of-the-game first-rate space rock / neo-psychedelic to be thoroughly soaked in through your {probably} already damaged ENOUGH remaining brain cels. Tracks that I found myself constantly being lured to play this title many times over are the acidic seven-minute opener ""Cosmic Gun"", the uplifting ""Inspiration"", ""77 Gaza Strip"", their playing of a Richard Thompson penned song ""Calvary Cross"" and ""Quiet Storm"". Couldn't help but to notice there are so many beautifully laced, rich melodies within this record. Line-up: Brendan Quinn-guitar,violin&vocals, Dan Parmenter-bass&vocals, Kris Thompson-keyboards and Joe Turner-drums. Highly recommended."

4,Very Good,"My daughter has a heart defect and I've used this and 2 of her other books to obtain ""flow-through grants"" to help with the medical expenses. Try looking in your hospital library for a copy and if they don't have one try the medical social workers. This book is well-organized, and is a great benifit to those who use it."
4,Tampa Bucs Mini Helmets,"Wow I was very pleased with the helmets I bought , they were a gift for my brother who is in Irag in the military and he needed them cause some of the former and recent nfl football coaches went over there to show there support and gave them autographs and pictures with them . The Soldiers needed some down time and I thought that was cool."
4,raving,This book is wonderful! It really helped me gather infomation on a career interest. I have definatly decided to become a geriatric nurse after reading this awesome book.
5,Practical Laptop Stand,"When you think Rolodex you think of that rotary index card system of years gone by. This beautiful and well made laptop stand proves how widely they have branched out. At the same time it is just as practical as the original ""Rolodex""; There is a clip at the back to keep cords under control and a removable area for auxiliary items. I bought this item as a gift for my husband and the design of the stand works very well with both his modern office style and his more traditional study at home. I will definitely get the other items in the range."
2,The Rice Cake Gets Eaten,"First, let me say that we own many children's books that represent Chinese culture, particularly since my husband is Chinese. So, we try to be culturally sensitive to different views of what makes a happy ending. However, both my daughter and I found it disturbing that the adorable rice cake which had been anthropomorphized for several pages was eaten. My daughter and I discussed how the gingerbread gets eaten in some versions too, and that this reflects different views of storytelling. However, this did little to make her feel better for the cute eaten rice cake. She couldn't sleep--definitely not a bedtime story. Beware if you are used to sanitized fairy tales."
3,The Rice Cake That Ranaway,I recommed this book for six year olds. The rice cake ran away because it didn't want to be eaten. Read this book to see what happens. Enjoy!
5,300 popular recordings from 1920-1951,"If you are interested in the history of popular recordings from 1920 to 1951, this 15 CD collection of these great songs and recordings is a must. Except for the 1920s, and due to the poorer sound of those early recordings, the AAD remastering is quite good. Included in this box set is an 80 page short bio of each artist that may be helpful, but is rather poorly written and not authoritative. But otherwise, what a great bargain, and what a great pleasure to have listened to these 300 full length recordings, many of which are rare and interesting including the many old standbys. Recommended!"
4,Seafarers of Catan,"Very good add-on to the original game. Adds a nice twist and makes it so that the players have to work together periodically, not just against each other."
3,Not the best of the available Settlers Games,"I am a major fan of Settlers of Catan, both the board and card game, as well as of Cities and Knights of Catan. The entire series is excellent, but of all of the variations, this is the one I like the least. I find that all it really accomplishes is slowing things down a good bit. With four players, the board can get crowded and players can be choked off when playing the original version, and this fixes that. So it does have that advantage. It also has various scenarios to play, so it does have that going for it. It's a good game, but not the pick of the lot."
1,"An Illogical ""God""","The god of this book is full of contradictions. For example, ""god"" says ""there is no such thing as wrong"" and later says it is ""wrong"" for parents to raise their own children."
1,Answers will come when you are ready to listen...,"After reading so many texts of enlightened words I found it difficult to accept that this is THE BOOK, straight from the 'horses mouth' (so to speak). But really, it doesn't matter which way you look at it as all words have truth in them...just sometimes our issues can get in the way.I found CWG 1 & 2 to be enlightening, in that which I had forgotten, and supportive, in that which I already knew. I felt very motivated to pursue life to my fullest potential and loved, to open my heart to the oneness of all beings.I look at both books as bibles of divine wisdom. Easier to understand and less room for misinterpretation than the Good Book! Please God, next time, try putting a title on the chapters for easier referencing."
2,Beware of false prophits,I was going along with this book until the author claimed that God endorces communism as the most evolved form or government. Then he tells us that the most highly evolved beings in the universe go about naked spurning technology in favor of a simple tribal life. Jesus Christ spacemen? New Age nonsense. Free enterpise has proven to be the best way to distribute good and services. History teaches as much. The author needs to take Economics 101.
5,"Books I & II have changed me: thoughts, career, who I am","I wish I could adequately express how important books I & II are to me. I am on my 4th reading of the 1st book... and I truly feel that my relationship with God... and myself have changed for the best. I love these books, and can hardly wait for book III to be printed."
1,couldn't finish this book,"I also bought all three books. The first I liked, the second was ok and the third offended me. I am beginning to think these books are simply written by a man who has made many mistakes in his life and making many justifications."
2,Walsch's political soapbox,"I find it difficult to believe that this book is anything more than Walsh taking advantage of gullible readers to preach his political views about global issues. I agree with Walsh at times, though often his extreme liberal views make me cringe. He talks about important issues, issues that I think all Americans should be aware of, however I think there are better books out there that discuss these issues in a much more objective (though nothing is ever entirely objective) and informed manner. If I ever would have believed that this phenom was for real, that possibility was blown out of the water when Walsh turned his book trilogy into a money making franchise that includes CD's, journals, companion books, a book for teens, and countless other pieces of merchandise. Anyone looking for a serious read in metaphysics ought to look elsewhere."
5,CWG books a blessing,"I feel truly blessed to be reading these books by Neale Donald Walsch. I can say with great certainty that my life would be far less rich if I hadn't found this wondrous document. For, in it, lies the answer to every question I could have thought to ask. And, by living these Truths, I have discovered that I truly can manifest anything I choose in my life."
2,WALSH RUNS OUT OF GAS ON THIS ONE!,I was initially quite interested in the first two books of Walsch's series but after forcing myself to read half way through this book I am now convinced he is motivated by profit. His ideas are quite profound and I must say he makes some great points in very important areas. He points out the fact there there are two previous books so many times in his conversation that he is obviously trying to get readers to buy them all. If these books are so good you would want to buy them all and he wouldn't need to advertise that there are other books on the way or already written. I couldn't read past the point where he started talking about the seven chakra levels and so much other drug induced ideas. He even tells the reader at the beginning of this book that these are GOD's ideas being screened through him so that we shouldn't take everything he says literally. Please don't take these book seriously but there are some good points to take home.
2,Conversations With God: An Uncommon Dialogue,"Yup, I bought all three!!!! If you are looking for a Christian book, this is not it!!!! I do not know the author, but his book is based on experience, not on the word of God, the bible."
5,Enter the Matrix...,"I started with ""A Course in Miracles"". Then book one of this series, then book two, then book three. Then a few books in between and along the way of similar topic. Then came forth ""The Urantia Book"", all part of my calling of forth a reason to this insane world and my place in it. I believe in Divinity and the intense force upon us from the relms of the Divine. I am being summoned. If you are called to a higher understanding of Divinity, I believe you will happen upon these ""Conversations With God"" readings. By ""higher understanding"" I am refering to the depth of what love really is. The real results of this series will be spread outward from here. I certainly feel that I am at my infancy of change.My gratitude to those who are into the change this world is taking. These books aren't for everyone...,yet."
5,CWG3 is another gem in the series!,The CWG series have been life transformational for me also. They have been and continue to be some of the most engrossing and profoundly informative reads I have ever experienced. They set the tone for a powerful array of consciousness raising information for the new millennium. I gain something new from them each time I dip into their pages. Quite simply -- each book is a good friend you can and will return to again and again. CWG3 is certainly no exception.
1,Dangerous Heresy!,"This book is nothing but a classic example of spirit writing. It contains just enough truth from the Bible to make it seem like treasure, but it is pure trash, and dangerous in that it will lead people away from the truth that the Bible and Christian churches present. The most effective lies contain some grains of truth, as does this. I assure you, God had nothing to do with this book, but I'm sure satan did. I doubt if anyone has the guts to publish this review. I had to tell the truth of it though. This book is different only in that it got published and was recieved by the secular world, but I can point you to some that are given away, and look just like it. Check out spirit writing folks. Demons and spirits love to make fools of people. Go ahead and spend money entertaining them if you want. Or burn it. Even that would be smarter!"
1,Written by a man with dillusions of grandeur,"I would like to express to anyone wishing to read this man's books is that either you believe in the Bible or you don't. The best way to express this is with the following scriptures: ""For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 2Timothy 4:3 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. Ezekial 13:9 Then the Lord said to me, ""The prophets are prophesying lies in my hane. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds. Jeremiah 14:14"
1,Written by a man with dillusions of grandeur,"I can see why Neale's books are so popular. He says there is no hell, and there may not be a hell in the literal sense, however, it is popular because it leaves people believing they can do as they please in this life and not have to pay a price. As far as Hitler going to heaven, because there is no hell, this is really sick."
1,This is TRASH!,Someone gave me this book...I read one chapter...it was so AWFUL I threw it in the trashcan - REALLY!
1,A complete lie,"This book is an absolute lie. there is no such thing as on the fence, the bible itself says you can only serve one master. I think walsh should have spent more time doing biblical reseach than fooling the american public with this farce. There is right or wrong, and this book is all wrong and true Christians should know this.There is a hell and those who think riding the fence is ok will one day be sadly dissapointed. I can't believe the public have become so immorally corrupt as to be duped into believing such filth."
1,Do not read,"I have been a Christian since my early childhood, attended a Christian college, took many Bible and theology courses, and currently teach teenagers about the love of Jesus Christ. I bought this book because the concept behind the writing sounded interesting and thought it might work as a new resource for me in my teaching.IT WAS TERRIBLE! I wouldn't give it any stars at all but this program does not allow for that. There are MANY places where it blatantly contradicts the Bible, even contradicts the very words Jesus is quoted as saying in the New Testament.Typically when I do not enjoy a book I either sell it at a yard sale or donate it so that at least others can enjoy it. In this case I threw the book out. I did not want anyone who is just exploring the idea of God or new in their faith to pick it up and read it and become totally confused."
1,Christian Be Warned - This Is Deception,"Quote from the book: ""You are already a God. You simply do not know it.""Funny Mr. Walsch knows this 'truth' and we all missed it?Funny that Jesus and the writers of the New Testament forgot to tell us that we are actually Gods. It is again a classical strain of New-Age type thinking 'Christian' authors who refuse to be like the Bereans and study the Word of God diligently!A steady diet of this sort of mumbo-jumbo will muddy up the true Mind of Christ that you are to have. BEWARE!The title then I presume could also be called: Conversations With YourselfLance MarchettiKroonstadSouth AfricaWas this review helpful to you? YES NO"
1,"ok, the people who believe this book are just stupid","ok, for one, this is a psychopaths opinion of the truth, not the truth itself. Why are you looking for truth in a book such as this to begin with? if your looking for truth, try the Bible!! i mean, DUH here, why not try intelligent thinking every once in a while you people???"
1,New Age Deception,"Neal Donald Walsch's dialogue with God sounds good at first, but, like all effective deception, it is truth mixed with error. Sorry, but I can't buy into this one."
1,Spiritually Lost,"Unbelievably vapid and illogical at times. Specious dialogue. Obsessed with his own lack of discipline and immorality. Looking for an excuse for his lack of self restraint and inability to choose to work through the difficult choices we make in life, every step of the way. We don't need another new age book about how to just feel good and happy."
1,Is this a GREAT country or what ?,"Where you can drive thru and get everything from tacos to a wedding certificate and never have to put out more effort than it takes to roll down the car window. Now Walsch has developed a spiritual framework for those who won't even use the drive-thru, but instead want it delivered to their door piping hot and to their taste. I love this guy. He's a true American Hero in my eyes. A new spiritual guru to go along with Ford Excursions, Big Macs, and WWF Wrestling."
3,"wow, man",This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs.I gave this book three stars because it makes a great beer mug coaster. Really super absorbent.
3,my book,"I have enjoyed both books on conversations with God and am currently reading the third trilogy. I understand and appreciate the basis of what it says and advises me, the reader. thank you for having this book available to me without the pricy mark up of the other book stores."
5,I saw the movie.. and now I want all the books!,"I just have to say that you must rent this movie if you have not seen it, you'll want to get all the books after that! :)"
5,"Stunning, life changing, humourous, breathtaking, revealing.","God's humour is what delights me most about book 3. What a wit (s)he is. Look, I said it all in the heading so I'll make this quick. Read this book, it's my duty to tell you. If you don't like it, or hate it, fine, you are not ready (I'm not trying to be condascending or anything, but a fact is a fact) For those that read it, and 'get it', ""isn't this like discovering life on Pluto, sort of thing?"" Wooooah, thanks Neale Donald Walsch. Heck, how's this going to look on my review resume`?"
5,A testament to a higher power,"This book, is extraordinary. While the title suggests Christianity or other religious entity, it is much more existential that it suggests. An unequivically poignant book, inspiration and a fine assist on one's spiritual journey. Hands down one of the best books I have ever read."
1,BenReader,Very disappointed. Poorly written. Curious where all the quotes were obtained from children of this age in that time period???? Even paper and typeset are very poor quality. Overpriced. Bud and Me a much better choice for this story.
5,THIS IS ONE OF WHITNEY'S BEST SONGS,AFTER LISTENING TO THIS SONG I STOPPED CRYING AT MY STEP-FATHER'S FUNERAL IT TOUCHED MY HEART FOREVER.
4,Worth buying!,"I had monopolized this book from the local library all summer, then finally purchased my own copy. It is a good way to learn some basic Ukrainian. I found it more relevant than some of the other books I had borrowed. The pronunciation guide was very helpful, as was showing the cursive alphabet. I also ordered the tape, not received yet, because it will be useful to hear the oral portion instead of bothering relatives all the time."
4,Good basic book,"Book is very good, maybe a little bit too easy for me because of working in Russia couple of years, but very good book to learn basic Ukrainian. Not enough exercicies and not enough grammatics."
3,"Not a basic primer, lacks basic conversation skills","Good introduction to pronunciation of alphabet. However, lacking in basic conversational skills, for example, expressing simple things such as ""I'm sorry, I don't speak your language""; ""do you speak English"". Of course, by the end of the book and a couple of tapes, you can figure out how to say these things."
5,thunder,This product is one I was already familiar with. It is the single most popular piece with those new to drum circles and kids.
5,Excellent rendition of a little-known story,"Mr. Hammontree gives us a fascinating look at the private life of Jennie Wade, the only civilian casualty at the Battle of Gettysburg, as well as reminding readers that not only the soldiers suffered in the war. Well worth a read for Civil War fans, reenactors, and especially those researching the lives of women of the period."
2,Dont waste your time unless you like thin cheap looking flatware,Very thin and it does not look as nice as it does on the internet. I dont think it would hold up for very long since it is so thin.
2,Rusty Knives,"Bought this set only a few months ago. Overall, happy with the way it looks and feels. However, my knives and only my knives are rusty. Especially in the little accent are with the three/four grooves. I am going to contact Oneida over this. I'll see how I do."
5,Oneida Banbury Set,This product was well worth it. I use it everyday and I'm very happy with it. I recommended it highly for a everyday set. Thanks!
5,"Glue is VERY sticky, no leaks, EASY to install","This is the second set of this brand that I have used. The other was on a Tahoe. Both were super easy installs. Just make sure to wipe down the tops of the doors first, and get them really clean and dry. If you do, this tape/adhesive is NO JOKE. It is VERY sticky and does not leak and they do not move. I wonder if you can even take them off! Anyway, a very nice product and easy as pie to install. One thing to note: these came with the manufacturer's logo and serial number stamped (melted) into the visor. My previous ones had it silk-screened on them with bright white lettering. I much prefer the subtle look of the stamped/melted lettering. Overall, a nice product and makes it easy to leave all windows cracked at night or during a hot day to keep the car a little cooler and fresher. Nobody even knows the windows are open."
5,This rack just what I was looking for!,"Not sure what I was looking for, and the little trowel I was using was a pain. When I read the reviews on this product, several people stated it was too short. I had no problem. I am 5'8"", and my neighbor who is 6'1"" didn't feel there was a problem. It makes a very unpleasant task seem almst like fun, and leaves the lawn free of debris. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
1,Might as well give your strong chewers an old t-shirt.,"I saw reviews describing how this toy stood up to people's big, strong chewers. Then I left it alone for a mere 5 hours with my 70 lb, 8 year old pit bull with half of her teeth missing, and came home to find it reduced to a mess of string all over my living room. I'm glad she must have been very entertained, but for $8 she should be getting a lot more out of it."
1,The ultimate way to pick up poo (not with this scooper),"Here's my way. My intent in sharing is nothing less than to make the world a cleaner place, wherein dog poo never makes contact with the ground (until it enters a landfill). I'm not kidding. In short, never let the sh!t touch the ground - put your hand in the bag and use it like a mitt to catch the turds as they emerge from your pooch's bottom. Use a bag without holes (blown up and pressure-tested), and have the mitt at the ready. If your dog pops a squat as quickly as mine does, then you'll be too late if you have to fish the bag out of your pocket first. In my opinion, this technique is less gross than using a bag or scooper to fish poop out of the grass, which often leaves fecal matter behind. Moreover, it inarguably leaves less trace on the ground, zero actually, than the pick-it-up-after-it's-down method."
3,great concept,works real well on the larger ones but the smaller ones fall through the tines. if it were made with the tines closer together it would be a great product. Have a Pom and his poops are small so they fall through when you pick them up. Arrived on time.
5,"So simple, but works so well!","I considered a lot of $30 and $40 scoopers at a big box pet store. Then I thought to check Amazon.com and I found this little beauty. The high ratings attracted me, and the low price sold me. Well it lived up to the ratings -- picking up poo is very easy and the wire rake cleans itself off nicely on the grass after I have disposed of my dog's offerings.It's a comfortable height for me (5'6"") and I would imagine for anyone a few inches taller or shorter. It might be less comfy for someone 6 feet tall.The handle is comfortable.Buy it! you won't regret it."
4,Its a rake folks,"For dogs, outside only, its heavy and dont think like I did, that it might be long enough for someone with a hip replacement to use in a litter box, because it isn't, you can't, the tines are too wide."
4,Hands down the best pooper scooper ever.,"I've never used this on anything but grass, but it is by far the best scooper I have ever used. I have broken dozens picking up poop from two Labs, but this is totally different. It just lifts the poop right out of the grass and I can get two to three poops per trip. It appears to be indestructible too, but i haven't had it long enough for it to rust.*6mo later: So after 6 months of use I still think this is the most useful pooper scooper on the planet, just not the most durable. After 4 months or so one of the welds broke that holds the rake to the handle, but the scooper was still usable. A few months after that the second weld broke and the rake completely separated from the handle rendering the scooper useless. HOWEVER, at ~$10 I just bought another one because nothing else comes close to scooping poop like this does. Still it looses a star for durability, if my next one lasts longer maybe I will add the star back."
5,This thing will change your life!,"I volunteer at an animal shelter where, as you can imagine, we do a lot of poop pickup. We keep two of these in every outdoor area, and it makes cleaning up a snap. Yes, you have to bend over a few degrees, but I don't see why the previous reviewer thinks this is a big deal. My husband is 6'4"" and thinks the ""poop fork,"" as we call it, deserves the Nobel Prize."
5,Best Pooper Scooper!,"I have three dogs, I foster dogs, and I have a dog sitting business...so I've tried MANY different pooper scoopers. This is by far the BEST and easiest pooper scooper to use. It is very effective and is priced reasonably. I highly recommend one for every dog household!"
4,Almost the best on the market,"This is a well made, sturdy product. My only problem is that the handle is to short for a 6 foot adult. The handle needs to be 12 inches longer to keep from bending over while using it."
5,WOW!!!,"I have scooped poop for as long as I can remember and have NEVER found anything that works as well as this wire rake!!!! Totally Amazing! It even picks up the gross, soft, squishy stuff (TMI)...I was so pleased I bought my daughter one (she has 3 mini-weenies) and she'll get it next week. Some of the people on the taller side said that the handle is a little short, but it is just right for me at 5' 8"" and it is light and easy to use. The rake is just awesome!!!!! If there ever was a must-buy this is it!!!!"
1,0 turds,"If I could rate this thing on a scale of 0 to 10 turds, I'd give it a 0, cause that's how many I was able to pick up. If your grass is astroturf it might work well, but all it did was yank the grass out of the ground, and drop the mess in the process. It's not that expensive, and maybe it will work for you, but with St. Augustine grass, I found it difficult to use..."
2,I despise this thing,"I don't like it at all. First it seems to always get caught in the grass and its like I'm having a tug of war with the grass over the poop, the worst part is when I pull to hard and rip up grass and it flings at me. Secondly one of the wires bent on it nothing worse than having to re bend the wire on the pooper scooper. Will be looking for a new pooper scooper."
5,The Best Pooper Scooper!,"I ordered one of these back in January of 2012, after we had brought our first puppy home. It is one of the best dog-related items that we have purchased this year! Now that our dog weighs well over 70 lbs., and his messes have gotten much larger, it is even more appreciated. It makes cleaning up our yard so quick and easy - and we never have to touch any of the dog's messes. I just ordered another one, after watching my Dad pick up after his dog with a shovel and hoe, and a plastic bag in hand. It looked so difficult, and I immediately thought of this item for him as well. I plan on giving it to him for Christmas - and I am sure that he is going to think it is one of the best presents he will have received."
2,Not good for small poop & tines broke,"I thought this one would work really well, however, it's not very good for small dog poop (falls through) and you have to balance the poop on it until you reach your final dumping ground, otherwise, it just slides off. I only had mine a couple of months when one of the tines broke off. Once that happens, forget trying to pick up anything. I'll be looking for a more sturdy, functional one."
4,Best Scooper,This is one of the best scoopers I have ever used! My only complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the handle could be a little longer.
5,Amazing.,Simply amazing. No more digging up grass and dealing with those claw style pooper scoopers. This picks up the poo and leaves the grass alone. Takes a little getting used to but once you use it a couple times it is really the best thing ever. I have already got three other friends to buy one after seeing it.
2,Good idea but falls short,Good concept overall but it isn't quite doing the job for me. Unless you have perfect/short grass then this won't work all that great. The metal isn't very thick and if one of the rake 'fingers' gets caught up on grass it bends. The fingers are a bit spaced out so it is better suited for larger dogs probably. The thing overall is a bit short so requires bending over a bit.
5,Brilliant!,"My husband kept buying the scoopers that had the claw-like mechanism, but they would break after a couple of months. I finally decided to order this one, which seemed simple, less likely to break, and I hoped it would be ergonomically easy to use as we have two dogs = a lot of poop. It appears indestructible and is easy to scoop the poop! One dog is small, and we are able to scoop her poop too. What more can you ask for? If you have dogs- GET THIS ONE."
5,Works Awesome!,"This scooper works great! We've had it for a year and couldn't be happier with it. It doesnt damage grass like a lot of the claw scoops so, and its able to pickup every poop no matter how hard or soft it is!"
4,best I've found so far,"tines do tend to bend a bit, but I like it better than others. the handle could be round like a broomstick instead of flat to be more comfortable."
2,NOT A FAN,"Great price! but that about the only positives I can think of. problem is that the wire bends and makes it really difficult to pick up my dog's deuces. I have a Great Dane, he takes massive dumps, should be as hard as it is. I'm about to buy another and throw this one out."
2,Well designed but cheaply made.,I loved this until one of the wire pieces fell off. Now the dog business that I pick up falls through this opening. I bought it in late January - less than three months ago.
3,Good with the right type of grass,"This scooper works well, provided you have blade-type grass, and not bermudagrass or similiar. This scooper will tear up bermudagrass - the tines will tangle with the sprawling bermudagrass and you'll end up pulling up just as much grass as dookey. Better suited for fescue. Also, contrary to another reviewer, product does not work well if your dogs have had mexican food - makes the mess even worse."
2,for people with really long arms,"This pooper scooper is awful. It's extremely short so you have to bend over to scoop. The tines are too far apart to pick up all the poop, pieces just fall right through. My large dogs are fed raw so even the 90lb dog has really small poop, it's almost impossible to pick all of it up. And worst is the curve at the end, trying to empty the scooper is an experience in itself. I ended up replacing the original 'pan and spade' scoop I had, finally a clean yard again (and in just one trip)."
2,Great entertainment for THE DOG ;),"I laughed when another reviewer mentioned chasing the poop around the yard, but sadly it's true.My dog uses varied backyard surfaces:**Grass - scooper catches in the grass and the tines bend**Flat dirt - above mentioned chasing**Seasonal leaves - the tines stab into the leaves which then block poo pickupBut above all, the worst is having to shove the poop ONTO the scooper. What good is it if I have to shove it with my foot? Plus, as others have mentioned, the tines bend relatively easily, making the scooper very difficult to use. Even with my foot I have a hard time getting the turd up and over bent tines."
3,Not for small dogs,"My dog is about 12 lbs. Her feces tends to slip through the cracks in the rake. This rake still works okay, but I will pick something else when I need a new one."
1,Avoid this pooper scooper. Its poop.,"I don't know why this thing has so many good reviews its terrible. Its a pain in the butt to get the poop off the ground, and even worse if you are trying to empty poop from the scooper into a bag. Forget about tossing crap over the fence, it will hit you in the face or fall on your head. This is basically a small rake, its crap. Get yourself a claw type with one handle."
2,tough to use,"I have a dog kennel in the country and wanted to use this rake to clean poop out of my dog exercise area. I found if the grass was a little on the long side the teeth of the rake got hung up in the grass. Perhaps this rake works well if the lawn is ""golf course"" short but I found the teeth on this rake are too long and make it difficult to use in my situation."
1,There are much better ones,"This one didnt work out for us.I have owned the grab and hold scoopers that work much better and make this unpleasant task quick and easy. We have 2 big dogs, that leave big and small turds.Problems:1. The wires are soft, get tangled in the grass and stretched out, making it difficult to lever the poop. Now, the last problem is the structure has come apart, (unglued) from the vertical handle. Useless now. (check out the photo I uploaded to illustrate the cheap material and poor construction).2. The system is absurd, let's the poop slide, so it takes me 3 times longer to grab and hold the turds to take them to the disposal location. Its me chasing turds around the grass, for 30 minutes. (!??)I have used it less than 4 months and here I am looking for another scooper. Not this one, for sure. Cheap ends up being more expensive."
3,Picks it up,"It does what its supposed to do, but with the tines bending with just a little bit of pressure, and then it not picking everything up because it doesn't lie flush, it's ok. Might be better if my landlord actually hired someone to cut the grass vs allowing it to grow pig weed and other weeds in it..."
5,easy use pooper scooper,It is simple to use and easy to clean by running the rake over the grass after use. Best one for that use I have found.
5,Best product,"Was looking for something cheap and found it. Works amazing. I'm 5""11 and hardly have to bend over. Have Kentucky blue grass and works fine. Have done around 10 times no issues. Better then picking up in a bag."
2,Wish I had done more research,"Our yard is all grass, but it is St. Augustine grass which is thick and the prongs of the rake get very caught up in them. It's frustrating, bent prongs. Probably suitable for softer grass, not St. Augustine."
3,Needs work,"Okay folks, here it is. Three 60 pound dogs, three quarters of an acre. A lot of poops. I would recommend this over any other style because it actually works and the poops remain intact. That is the important part.I had to modify this scooper some time ago, into more of a shovel shape. I bent the 'Y' shape backwards. I don't recommend doing that unless you're a bit handy because the welds aren't strong and mine broke.After back surgery I got smart and finally put a steel pole on it to make it about 6 feet long. Now I am a poop picking up machine. Me and my cart and my modified scooper.So if you don't mind bending over or you're pretty handy, you should get this."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"So never in a million years did I ever think that I would ever be reading let alone writting a review for a poop scooper.... All the reviews made this item sound great.. I was actually excited to get it in the mail. Well once I got it and actually had to use it, It was horrible.. If you think you are ever going to get the little poop your WRONG.. it is just going to fall right through. And then to get the poop off the rack and into the bag you have to bang it just to get it off.. It sticks to the rack.. I guess the only good thing about it is not only will it get some poop but, it will also do your weeding and pull up any weeds along with it.."
3,Smooth transaction...but not my favorite scooper,"This transaction went well but the scooper is not my favorite. Well made, but the tines are too far apart. They pick up after the basset hounds but not the chihuahua. The little poops just fall through. It's very frustrating! Plus, I'm not crazy about the angle of the whole thing. It makes it hard to dump the poops into a plastic bag. I'll keep looking."
4,"Dirty Job, but this rake can do it","I was immediately attracted to this product because we have deep grass in our yard, and after the poop hardens, it's difficult and not a very enjoyable experience to try and fight the grip that the grass has on said poop. I do not recommend using this product right after your dog finishes their business, soft stool will leave you with more than you'll want to clean up from off of the rake bars. It's a bit awkward to make the transition from rake scoop to a small poop bag, so I would recommend dumping from rake scoop into a larger waste bin."
1,A Waste of Time!,"I got this because I liked the fact that I would be able to finish the course from my home and you would get an official certificate of completion at the end which you are supposedly able to send in to the DMV and your insurance company, which will then help lower your rates.Three problems - First, it took FOREVER with lots of e-mails and phone calls to get them to finally mail me my certificate! Second, the insurance company did not accept their certificate and Third, the DMV does not recognize this course as a Certified Defensive Driving course. No wonder they were dragging their heels on sending me my certificate!If you're planning on spending days on your defensive driving skills so you can send in your certificate to the DMV & your insurance company, don't waist your time with this!"
5,HELPS ME SAVE MY SELF FROM SELF DESTRUCTION !,I got this software and learned that I was driving recklessly without regard to myself and others. I could not believe that after how many years of driving i was using wrong techniques and maneuvers. I highly recommend this to everyone even to seasoned drivers.
4,In the Belly of the Whale,"I have been in therapy for nearly a year and I think this book has helped me understand depression better than the counseling sessions. I liked the author's personalization, because I also was so depressed, I felt like I was in the belly of the whale. It's rare to find a therapist who understands what you are going through when you are depressed. I was at rock-bottom when I bought this book. It gave me hope. After reading her nutritional section, I found out that I had hypoglycemia and candida. As the candida clears up, and the diet improves (no sugar, white flour), I find that I am feeling so much better. I also walk around saying, ""Cheese,"" and I believe it does change my endorphins. I recommend it. Maybe it's a five star."
5,Just as promised,I would purchase from this seller again. It was just as promised and sent with speed.
2,Not so good,"I have a very minimal knowledge of German. This is the first German class I have taken in college and I feel like the examples used are irrelevant to words/phrases that I will ever use. Even my instructor (who is from Germany) says that the words used are very awkward examples. The CD and website is a must have, and the workbook has not been updated for the newest edition."
1,Practically unusable.,"This is the single worst textbook I have ever used, for any subject, ever. The most frustrating thing about it is the fact that there is no way to reference anything. When you are trying to use it in conjunction with the workbook it becomes very apparent. You end up paging through each chapter individually to try to find the information that you need, and the chapters themselves are arranged chaotically. When you do find the information you need, expect to find it sprinkled with words you haven't learned yet and, again, have no way to reference. I am not excited to hold on to this book for future levels of German, but unfortunately, at my school, the curriculum and textbook is set by the department so it's not changing. Unless of course between now and next semester they come out with a new edition, rendering mine useless and void of any resale value. Yay."
3,"Good for learning, bad as a reference","I'm using this book in course and have been pretty happy overall. It covers good useful material in a moderately quick pace. One down side is that it can be hard to look up specific information. You would do well to get a second book, a dictionary + verb list for easier reference.Also, the book is freakishly expensive. The price rarely seems to come down, and you'll do best getting a used copy from a reputable dealer, but if you are lucky you may catch a new dealer offering the book at a really good price."
3,"I agree, very confusing","The exercises are bizarre, and the conversations are too... Such as ""Why does Jorg have a car if he doesn't have friends?"" The cd's confuse me. I don't know where they correspond too. I am sure they must to something, but it should be more clear. It is very discouraging when you barely want to even hear the cd's and you put them on and they don't make any sense. The S2 S1 scripts are confusing too. I guess for some of them you have to go to the back of the book to answer the questions (not the index but the other part of the script). I don't think it explains grammar all that well. I have read the grammar explanations elsewhere so it wasn't so bad, but I could see how it could be if yo uhad no prior knowledge. The workbook is very confusing. Literally half of the time I was unsure what it was even asking me to do."
3,Not the best,"This book is.... decent. I find that there is insufficient explanation in English to fully grasp the concepts. Expect to spend a lot of time asking your instructor questions, because this book isn't going to do you many favors. Going it alone? Good luck. Prepare to have phrases thrown at you in seemingly random order and have to figure them out for yourself.Who I would recommend this book to: Anyone forced to get it for a class."
4,A great read,"Chris and Gayle's tumultuous relationship is full of flashes of love for each other and of the pains each experienced in previous relationships and in childhood. Chris is a single mother who doesn't value Gayle's involvement in the church, and Gayle uses this sometimes to drive a wedge between them. Weaving the past with the present, the story gives a full portrait of these two African American women who are both struggling to overcome their pasts and find a way to live in the present. While sometimes the story gets a bit overly dramatic and the flashbacks seem to meander at times, ""Fire and Brimstone"" is a compelling read as the reader follows Gayle and Chris through their trials to see if they can make it together. This is a provocative first novel that gives the reader much to consider."
3,don't let the cover fool you,"Don't let the cover fool you, this is not a trashy book, nor is it exploitative. The story of Gayle, Chris and God is rich, interesting and well written. The author talks about a side of life that many of us don't really think about. This is a fine first novel."
4,stuff not in some of the other books,"Two things were new to me:1) the Fermat matrix2) an Umbral Calculus expansion of the Eulerian numbersI can't give the book fives stars because ""the number of graphs or order k on n""just doesn't seem to be something you can compute using his text.For 1974 this was a very advanced text and he talks of a sequelthat I'm going to look for now!This text is maybe one that Dover Books should reproducefor students."
5,ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS,Delivered quickly and in great packaging. The jersey is just beautyful. Once you have it in your hands youll understand this is something to wear on gameday only. Not an everyday piece. Even in the stitches you can see the dedication. I would calle it a luxury item but then again im the biggest Bavaro fan in the world. Worth every penny if your a Giants fan
1,bad deal,"Though this title, ""Cops,"" is rare to find as a stand alone DVD, this particular print is not worth your money. Not only is the print quality poor, it has no sound track at all. It is a silent ""silent movie,"" which was never the way the genre was supposed to be--all silents had background music when they were shown. Anyway, this copy of ""Cops"" looks like a bootleg copy from another source. It is a bad deal--one might almost say, criminally bad."
5,Dickens at his best,"If you have, are, or have had, Deaf in your family or friends you will be interested in this highly intelligent treatment of the subject during a time when Deaf were not well treated or well thought of.If you are interested in how life was lived in Dicken's time this book is revealing.It is obvious why this work was not a classic. It does not strike most people's ""chord"" as some of his others did.Being interested in history and interested in Deaf Culture I found the book a very worthwhile read."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased my copy used (20$) and (after my initial delight at the bargain) was disappointed. I had hoped for a more technical intermediate-level expansion of Wheeler's intriguing but vague ""Journey into Gravity and Spacetime."" This book is instead largely a hodge-podge of specialty articles of interest only to advanced professionals in the field. Unless you have money to burn, invest it in another text, like ""Gravitation,"" by Thorne, Wheeler, etc., which isn't great but is useful."
1,terrible,"This is a terrible book, a scam if you will. In the first place, charging [$$$]for a under 200 pages, and with very small demensions, is outright theft. Secondly, the book is merly a summary of court cases, which can be obtained freely on the internet or from the US patent office web site, in greater detail. Thirdly, the author repeats himself many, usually entire paragraphs worded in slightly different ways. I can only think is is an attempt to ""pat"" the book and add more pages."
3,"Aspires to be meaningful, accomplishes little","I have just read Richard Brzostek's review of Insatiability and, having just watched the film, I agree with him entirely. This is a strange film and not one that resonated with me. I don't know whether Richard has the advantage of speaking Polish, but I found the often clumsy subtitles a hindrance to following the film. I see some clown describes the film on the cover of the DVD as ""A futuristic remake of Pasolini's Salo"" and elsewhere we are introduced to ""Our stunningly handsome young hero..."" Unfortunately, neither description is valid. The film runs for just under 2 hours and can rightly be described as theater - but I came away very disappointed. I can see how it can be described as a sex romp and I suppose it tries hard to flirt with political and philosopical themes, but then, so do Marvel comics, I guess"
1,Don't do it!!!,"Don't waste your money! Skip this and buy one of the world-class level DVDs of these operas that are out there rather than wasting money on this set, even if it seems like a bargain. I've only seen the Figaro and Cosi, but they weren't even at the level of a good amateur or student production...aside from the overall low level of vocal and acting skill, what I saw of the Figaro had horrifying musical slips - intonation problems, lack of ensemble, singers entering in the wrong key. I've never seen anything like it in a commercial release - certainly don't waste your money on it!"
4,Good Reference and an Easy Read,"A student of mine (college level) for whom English is a second language asked me to recommend a ""grammar book"" he could have in his arsenal, not something long and consuming but something easy, accurate, readable and digestible. So I spent the better part of a morning cruising shelves at a couple of bookstores, until I came across GRAMMAR POWER by Jane Schwartz. It fits the bill perfectly. No, it's not an ESL reference, but what my student needs is a handy reference for things he needs to be reminded of, and it's as necessary for him as it is for my students for whom English is a first language!This little book is concise, topical, and energetic, and for anyone who needs to be reminded of--or freshly informed about-- the underpinnings of writing and speaking in English, this is it!"
2,"Great product, poor condition","This is an excellent book for anyone needing a refresher in grammar and basic writing skills. I had borrowed this from my library, and intended to purchase it for my father in law to use at work. I was sadly disappointed when I received the book.The seller, Sean P. McLaughlin, must not understand the meaning of ""very good."" When I buy a used book marked as such, I expect it to be very gently used. I do not expect it to have feathered edges, highlighting, and writing throughout. I will be returning this book, and I will remember his name so that I do not ever purchase any other items from him. I will also remember this when I sell back books to Amazon, ones that have barely been opened, and only get credit for ""good"" books."
2,Let The Buyer Beware,"I bought this book after hearing an NPR interview with the author. My mistake. Blyth sounds better than she reads. While some of the issues she discusses may be relevant, her writing style is repetitive & bludgeoning & her continual whine that the business she profited from is exploitive & manipulative is not a new concept. Authors much more articulate & eloquent have been discussing it for years & any woman with basic common sense can see through the industry's ploys without Blyth's finger-pointing. Women are already thinking for themselves & have been for generations so spare us your self-serving instruction!"
1,Gossipy and gloomy,"Myrna Blyth claims that women's magazines conspire against women to make them victims. Well, they might, but her book does exactly the same thing: it tells women that they are victims of a conspiracy to make them victims!I do not accept that women are victims. Women are able to think for themselves. I trust in women's ability to think; the majority of women will not accept (let alone buy!) something that if they are unhappy with it. There is the possibility that there are large numbers of magazines giving women similar messages BECAUSE women want those messages.'Spin Sisters' is not a good book. Blyth aims to be scholarly, but her arguments are illogical, contradictory and incomplete. She tells some amusing anecdotes, and that is is the main virtue of her book. But it seems rather sad that she can only reinforce the ""You are a victim!"" message, instead of giving women something positive to consider - wouldn't that be far more valuable?"
1,Repetitive,There is no need to read past the first chapter -- she just says the same thing over and over. She had a kernel of an idea that she fails to flesh out. Poorly written and thimble deep. Lots of clever sound bites that add up to nothing.
2,Talk about selling women short!,"This author certainly does, as if women haven't read these magazines and laughed over 80% of content for decades! Also feeling sorry for that Cosmo Single Girl editor and her sad life. It's pure escapism and fun to look at trends and fashion. I see a lot of ""that jealousy is unattractive in you."" She takes herself and her role far too seriously."
2,guilty pleasure,"I have always considered women's magazines to be the perfect antidote to the cumulative effects of shrieking feminists. KatieMac says all heterosexual sex is rape? Redbook tells about ""The sex skill men adore, and how to do it well."" There is something about squabbles between women that men just can't resist. Maybe it is the notion that they are fighting over us; that for all their lofty demands, what they really want is our attention.Anyway, I think women get along just fine. They want what they want and publishers are smart enough to give it to them. The only real stress in women's lives (qua women) is trying to convince themselves they want something more than a high-status male and lots of children to secure her place in his cozy household.This book has entertainment value but not much else. Blythe offers no insight as to what message the women's media industry SHOULD be offering women but she does dish delightfully on her former covenmates."
5,Terrific book,"I bought this book after I read a great review of it in the Wall Street Journal and saw the author on TV. It's loaded with anecdotes of what really goes on in the world of magazines and examples of how the TV divas force their agendas on us.This book is insightful and funny, too. I know I'll look at all media with a more critical eye after reading it."
4,Acid humor,"What ""You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again"" did for Hollywood, Myrna Blyth's Spin Sisters does for New York's mediaville. Most readers will be fascinated by Blyth's acidity and humor -- but not those skewered."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,And i'm not going to waste my time delineating the innumerable inadequacies of this tediously boring book that offers no new insights into the industry and beast that the author slavishly served for so many years. Blyth is trying to spin herself into another career and she only comes off as an Anne Coulter wannabe in need of a good editor and a better subject.
1,Blyth's bid to return to media as a right-wing pundit,"After getting bounced from Ladies Home Journal, here is Blyth's desperate attempt to return to the media spotlight, this time as a right-wing pundit.""This is someone over 6o who wants to create a big-enough stir to get on TV"" remarked Cosmo editor Kate White."
1,A truly silly book,"This writer doesn't give us women enough credit. We read women's magazines because we like them--although I have to say that the writers magazine Ladies Home Journal was always boring, and features much more of the silly stuff that the writer accuses other magazines of printing."
3,A Book Explaining the Obvious,"Spin Sisters : How the Women of the Media Sell Unhappiness - and Liberalism - to the Women of America by Myrna Blyth is a book explaining the obvious. Anyone vaguely familiar with women's magazines can identify the ungraceful manipulation of their text.As a girl of ten sitting in my parents' hair salon, I recall flipping through an array of women's magazines noting the negative connotations and psychological manipulations.If you have trouble reading between the lines, then I suppose this book will be helpful to you, but keep in mind that this book was written by a magazine editor."
5,"simply the best cookbook ever written, in the entire world","This is a cookbook that is full of technique - don't try to brown too many pieces at a time or the temperature of the pan will be reduced and you'll end up with a gray mess with a lot of liquid. I'm paraphrasing, but Michael's language is simple, disarming and fun.It's also full of great, great recipes and menu suggestions.He was the NY Times cooking editor, also a concert pianist.All of his books are worth having and using - even the one edited after his death (it has the best pork and sauerkraut recipe ever).In this book you must try his chicken liver pate, the pork chops in mustard cream sauce, potatoes Anna, well everything.My advice, buy the hardback; it will be well-used."
5,Special recipes for the beginner and experienced cooks,"This cookbook was recommended to me by someone who told me that it contained the most remarkable recipes. If you love to cook very special meals for very special occasions, this is a once in a lifetime little purchase. The book also has lots of helpful information for beginners and can give the experienced cook more ideas for even greater improvement. It's an all around good investment for special occasions and every day."
2,"Mostly waterproof, but not for writing checks; not for lower-priced Lamys.","This ink has the ancient ""iron gall"" formula with its nifty aroma. Iron gall ink is waterproof but not safe enough for writing checks. Iron gall ink looks good from a ""wet-writing"" pen, but the lower-priced Lamy ""Safari"" and ""Al-Star"" pens are not ""wet"" enough. Also, you should never let iron gall ink dry out in a pen (permanent clogging!), and you should flush an iron-gall-using pen in both directions with plain water (pulling water in and forcing water out) every month or so."
4,"Good pen, good price","Good pen, writes well and it showed up on time as expected. I will be ordering more colors in the near future."
5,Lt Bak does it again! top notch,"So far, A Cruel Deceit, ranks as Haney's best so far. Lt. Bak, helps investigate a Hittite murdered in another jurisdiction.He's threatened too and a superb climax"
5,A novel approach to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon,"What happens when eight non-Mormon scholars are offered $100,000 each to spend seven weeks cloistered on a lavish estate to test the Book of Mormon for internal evidences of antiquity? With the background of a wife who holds a personal grudge against the Mormons, and a father-in-law who is a televangelist and has lectured against mormonism, Stephen Thorn is one of those men. The director of the project is fighting his own battles against those who want to close it down.This is a really interesting approach to the subject, insightful yet not at all dry, with great characters and a fascinating storyline. I've read it a couple of times over several years, and it is worth another read."
3,Too tight at toe area,"My brother and I wear the same size of shoes, so he bought these and I wore them 2 days, they are too tight at the toe area, so my toes were a little sore the second time I used them. I purchased the Mizuno Men's 9-Spike Pro Limited Low G4 Cleat, and these are much more comfortable a more wide toe area."
3,Works good but missing a part.,I got this spreader from amazon and it was missing a crucial part and did not work. I tried contacting the company to get the part and they sent me the wrong one so I returned it to Amazon. The return process at Amazon is really nice though and was super easy. I have since picked up one of these spreaders at a store and it does work good but my first one was missing a part.
4,Wear Windbreaker Protection Prevent Skin Rash,Works great.Has great dispersion.I would have given it FIVE starts except I gota very bad skin rash from the Ortho grass seed powder.Next time I will wear a windbreaker no matter how hot it is.I start with the bottom on top and I start craking the wheel.THEN I lower the scatter wheel downward while still cranking.It's a FIVE START product ... the grass seed or chemicals inside were the problem.I already wrote on the outside of the bag to wear a windbreakers and take a shower right after using it.
3,VERY GOOD,"HOLA AMIGOGRACIAS POR EL ENVIO Y DESPACHO DEL PRODUCTO, MERCANCIA EN BUEN ESTADO A EL LOS PLAZOS DE TIEMPO ACORDADOS.SALUDOSHY FRENDTHANK FOR EVERY THINK, WAS VERY GOOD JOB.SEE YOU.."
1,What a mess!,"This is difficult to use, you need 3 hands and it shoots out so fast, would not buy again"
4,Works as described,"I have used this to seed a garden cover-crop mix, a grass seed mix, and seed oats. It has worked pretty well for those things.A little practice with the sequence of events will give smoother results: Start walking and cranking BEFORE you open the sliding trap door that lets the seed out of the bag. Then, release the catch on the trap door and let it snap closed before you stop walking and cranking.This tool is for right-handed cranking only and cannot be reversed for left-handed operation. The bag on my unit is red nylon. I expect to get lots of years of service from it."
4,Earthway 2750 Hand-Operated Bag Spreader/Seeder,The Earthway 2750 hand-operated bag spreader/seeder is the best thing on the market as far as I am concerned. I've been buying them for years. Price is good also thru Amazon.
4,good product,I purchased this to replace an older different brand. I have a family member who owns one of these and has been very pleased with it. I have only used it twice so far but I think it will be a great product
5,"Sophisticated, yet easy to use","This is a nice bag spreader. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be on your way to putting the seeding/spreading job behind you. Practice a bit rotating and opening the release before it's for all the chips. It's a rhythm thing."
3,"No Comfrey, Ingredients are slightly different than what is listed here on Amazon","Just wanted to warn anyone purchasing this that the product ingredients listed here on Amazon are not exactly what is on the shipped item.They took out Comfrey Root and put Nettle Leaf instead.I was annoyed because I specifically ordered this to get the original version that had Comfrey Root.Not sure if Life Balm forgot to update or change the listing here on Amazon??The actual ingredients are as follows:Wildcrafted Shavegrass Herb, Organic Nettle Leaf, Organic Oatstraw, & Wildcrafted Lobelia herb.Other ingredients: A base of pure Vegtable Glycerine & Distilled water.As for usage experience so far....I found that it has a pleasant taste like drinking sweet herbal tea, not bad. Since the version I got does not have the Comfrey in it I use it as a mouth swish and supplement internally to get the natural silica to calcium conversion."
1,Love Barry Manilow's music but cassett did not play,I was very disappointed with this product. I had aticipated listening to Dance Away and the cassett although wrapped in cyclophane did not work at all. Would not recommend buying cassetts online ever.
1,disappointed,With 200 pounds of drywall tires bowed . This made it impossible to control. I wound up carrying each sheet by hand. I have several trojan tools and all work extremely well. This was the first onei have had a problem with.
4,Abstract Production,"Good production of the opera, especially if you are familiar with the score and story and are open to an abstract production.The Captain is not shown being shaved. Instead, Wozzeck threatens him with the knife he eventually kills Marie with. The singing is mostly good and accurate(very difficult in this atonal work). Marie is a bit squally and The Captain screams rather than sings his extreme high notes. The doctor is well sung and is a menacing insect-like character. At the end, I felt, as I do whenever I hear/see Wozzeck, that it is one of the greatest opera dramas ever written."
3,A stop-gap Wozzeck,"The best word to decribe our reaction to this most likely made for TV production was ""interresting"". The sets are abstract, a large cube rotates between sceenes and there is much random movement of the characters. Dale Duesing is very expressive and most of the singers seem quite competent (although I did not follow this opera with a score)but this performance did not provide the searing emotional experience I hoped for. There is no booklet provided and sometimes subtitles obliterate the singers. The sound was good."
3,I would give it a 5 if it continued to work!,"This works awesome when it works. Unfortunately it corrodes inside the spray arm & the corrosion then clogs the holes. Then the head blows because of built up pressure. I used it for 10 minutes & it quit spinning. Luckily it is manufactured 1 hr away from me & when I called them, they asked me to bring it to them & they cleaned it out & replaced the head which had blown. I used it for a few hours & it has done the same thing again. This time I shut it down right away & hopefully this spring I'll be able to dissassemble & clean out & reassemble & it will work again. Otherwise I'll take it back out to the manufacturer & hopefully they'll help me out again."
2,Disappointing,"Took a chance by purchasing book cover unseen, and with no excerpt. Very disappointing.If you really want to get the full in-depth, eye-opening, bible-based truth of why we, as Black people, are where we are at this point in time and fully understand God's plan for us as Black People. YOU MUST READ.......""Bible legacy of the BLACK RACE"" by Joyce Andrews. Now, this is one fantastic book!!! I pray to my Heavenly Father, that this book becomes known widespread among us. Our children and adults need to know that they are in the Bible and that, being direct descendants of ANCIENT EGYPTIANS, GOD IS RESTORING US. For starters read--ISAIAH 19:24."
1,Disappointed,"Jonathan Winters is a great comedic talent, but I'm sorry to say this album was a disappointment. It was rambling and repetitive. A better bet would be his earlier work."
2,this is not the funny one!,"winters had another ""leave a message"" tape that was much funnier.this one has 2 or 3 amusing tracks, but the rest are a little spooky-sad.still, JW was a fascinating comic and humanboyce"
3,Good general guide but out of date,"This serves as a general guide but some of the information in this book is already out of date. For example, when cleared to taxi to a runway but to do so, you must cross another runway. Are you cleared to cross the non-active runway? The book's answer is yes, but actually that rule has changed. Now you must have separate clearances to cross other runways. Not only could this fail your checkride, but this is even more potentially dangerous later on as you fly as a private pilot.This is the 9th edition, and as of the date of this review, it's the latest edition. They should either publish a new edition real soon, or put pocket inserts in the current editions to reflect the latest rule changes.IMO you should rely on your CFI and latest FAR/AIM for all the rules, and only use this guide informally to get a taste of what kind of questions to expect on your checkride."
4,Detailed but not thorough,"This book thoroughly reviews most topics that you will need to know to pass your oral test, but not all topics are covered. Examples are emergency procedures and plotting cross-country courses."
2,A mockery of a Dreamcast classic,"When I first go this game for the PC, I was really excited. I thought that this would be game I can enjoy on my laptop on the go, considering the one on Dreamcast is one of the best video game racers ever created. The DC version looked beautiful, played like magic, and had a good deal to unlock.The PC version on the other hand, has bland, almost ugly graphics, horrid handling, and pretty much nothing good. It is obviosly the down graded version of an already bad and down graed version of the PS2 game. All the unlockable courses are still there, along with the cars, but that can't save it from being a very, very bad game.So if you own a Dreamcast, this is a game to get, but on the PC its just another bad racer."
3,Catchy at start'n all :),"good game for its time i guess!, i like lemans itself. Its really fast game. But i think they could go with a lil more realistic for handling, crashing, TURNING. and also the graphicsthese 4 elements changed could give it much better of a game i say :)"
5,Streisand at the Village Vanguard,"It's Streisand, how could it be bad! Watched it on PBS and could not wait to see and hear it again."
5,Here is the live of the star of the stars!,"I know her for a long time and I had a few albums. But I became a fan lately since I listened to the song ""Cry me a river"". This DVD makes me feel as if I was there and dunk so comfortably with her songs and looks. Yes, I'm in love with Barbra, although it's too late."
4,One Barbra Only,Whatever you may think of Streisand's politics -- one can't overlook her incredible voice. Her voice is clear and pitch perfect. 'One Night Only' gives comfort to everyone. A 'must-have' to all Barbra lovers and a 'must-have' to all those who appreciate a very talented singer.
5,Ageless and Evergreen,"What a sublime treat this DVD is! Barbra unplugged; so real, natural, funny and so brilliant. Yes, the voice is now rough around the edges on occasion--though not often, and her pure, sweet bell-like head tones are essentially intact, as is apparent on ""Bewitched"" and ""The Gentle Rain."" To say she doesn't look, sound or act her age--approaching 70--is a grand understatement. She has always innovated and pushed down barriers and is now doing it for ""seasoned citizens,"" without making a big deal about it. The Vanguard show is pure Streisand and it just doesn't get any more compelling. In a day when so many singers over sing, over ornament and are overproduced, these pared down exquisite performances can stand as a textbook for aspiring singers of all generations, assuming they are blessed with otherworldly talent and taste to begin with."
5,Must have,If you are a Barbra Streisand fan this is a must have! The venue was perfect for such an event.
5,Barbra is the best,"I'm watching this intimate concert right now on a PBS fund raiser. Barbra is in her 60s (67 at this point), and she sounds as good as ever. Amazing. She obviously takes good care of herself. And looks wonderful, too. She's the greatest pop/show singer alive right now--all we have left of the golden era of American music--which is now hidden on PBS fund raisers. Love you, Barbra--always. You and Frank and Ella and Judy. The last of the great ones."
3,Boring,"Barbra Streisand is a legend, but this release is a real bore. The DVD is okay. But be warned-do not play the CD. It is just a bunch of talking and is only a nice addition to the collections of those who adore Ms. Streisand."
4,wonderful,"I've pre-ordered it for my mother. Beautifully done, but I'm sure many would expect nothing less. I enjoyed the French lyrics in the middle. Brolin didn't have to be in the video, but that's o.k. Ms. Streisand makes herself rare, forcing many frustrated not hear her more. While not a rabid fan, I've always been impressed by anything she does. I think I'll order two."
2,Annoying,"You would think by now, Barbra would know that NO ONE wants to hear her ramble on, talk during her songs, or waste time with asides that no that is not there live will ever understand.Her singing remains pristine, but I don't want to hear her chatter on when she SHOULD BE SINGING!!!!!!"
3,"A ""70s"" Lincoln, Not The Right One.","Oates' biography, though very readable and quite good on Lincoln's personal tragedies, is far from a persuasive or fair portrait. Oates advertises his 1970s New England liberalism by painting Lincoln as all but wanting to be an abolitionist and egalitarian, but darn those dang border states and that Constitution tying his hands! Such authors have stretched long chapters around a few tidbits like Lincoln's one-time public favor of limited black suffrage and very little more. Lincoln was more of a moderate realist for reasons of his own view on the desireable pace of national reform, and not simply because of external factors. He was neither a Radical Republican restrained by the Constitution, or a conservative wishing to maintain the status quo. Before this book, Lincoln biographers dragged him too far right, and Oates overcompensated, dragging him too far the other way. David Donald's LINCOLN is far superior."
4,Great,Well I needed to read this book for a history book report. The book was interesting but also boring for a 14 year old to read. All of the political stuff but it was still a great book about Lincoln. I learned a lot about him and and how much he must have been stressing while he was President. If you like to read then u might as well read this book.
1,"Well written, but...","This work is very well written, but either the author is determined to present to the reader the image of Lincoln we all got in grade school or he didn't do nearly enough research into Lincoln's reign during the Civil War. For a much more accurate and documented view of what Lincoln was like during the years of the Civil War, I highly recommend the book, ""When in the Course of Human Events"" by Charles Adams. Adams' book will give you everything your grade school teachers didn't tell you. History is written by the victors."
1,Another Whitewash of the 16th President.,"Will anyone dare to write an accurate assessment of the 16th President or are the myths that surround him just to strong to penetrate? I await a writer willing to discuss the wholesale destruction of property in the South that left thousands of civilians to starve, destruction sanctioned by Lincoln. I await a discussion on the hostage taking and the indiscriminate killing of Southern civilians. I await a thorough discussion of the Dahlgren Raid and its implications, I await a real assessment of the Lincoln/Seward relationship, and I await a real judgement on Lincoln's lack of religious belief. This book, like all the others ignores anything that might be the slightest cotroversial and that might dent the aura surrounding Abraham Lincoln.Alan Lowe. BA. Manchester Metropolitan University."
4,A luxurious reading experience,"This book generated controversy among Lincoln scholars. The general reading public, however, will probably enjoy both the book's prose and its story. Regardless of whether there is much, or anything, new in the volume, its account of Lincoln is told with flair. Points that disturbed some Lincoln scholars will probably not be noticed by general readers. I read the book before I knew about the dispute, and found the volume enchanting."
5,Fine Introductory Biography of Lincoln,"I am a retired history teacher and I read 'With Malice Toward None' when it was first published and loved it. As a matter of fact, my paperback edition is falling to pieces from re-readings and use and I am now buying the hardback edition. I used portions of the book with my 8th grade American History students and with my high school American History and Advanced Placement American Studies classes. It was a great introduction to Mr. Lincoln, I thought, and an easy and entertaining read according to my students. Mr. Oates has a flair for compelling drama. When the controversy arose over the text, I included the controversy in the discussion of the book with my AP students. I have read many other fine books on Mr. Lincoln by Eric Foner, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and James M. McPherson (to name a few), but Stephen Oates' 'With Malice Toward None' is still my favorite, warts and all."
4,Page Turner,"Very informative book, easy to read, gives a broad detail in the battles back then, highly recomended. Only wanted more detail about Lincoln and less about his generals."
5,The most compelling biography ever written on Mr. Lincoln.,"Being an avid reader and researcher on the life and times of Abraham Lincoln, I have never before encountered a more beautifully written and moving biography then what Mr. Oates has produced. I would like to encourage all readers and budding historians who wish to learn more about this great American icon to indulge themselves in this fantastic work by Mr. Oates. You may never feel compelled to purchase another biography on the life of Abraham Lincoln again."
4,"Very good product, just a few quirks","I like this case very much for my Blackberry. It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone. It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse. My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases. (Come on guys! Women use these items too!) Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case. Other than those two things, this is a great, not bulky case."
3,Speck Products SkinTight PDA Skin w/ Holster,"Pretty good quality and it probably does the job if you want to keep the device in a purse or bag. I stopped using it because I keep my blackberry in a coat pocket, and it doesn't slip in and out of the pocket very easily due to the friction from the fairly ""sticky"" skin."
4,Great book for Costuem Design,Very detailed and informative. It does not have as many sketches as I would like but it is very precise. Great for Costume Design students.
5,Too big for small town,"A friend told me to get this album- on the strength of one single on the radio. So I did- and in 3 weeks, I have yet to take it out of the CD player. And you cannot listen to it quietly- turn it up- enjoy the vocals! This guy is so pro it makes me wonder why some big recording company hasn't snagged him yet. Could it be they haven't taken the time to listen? I will be wrapping several of these as gifts this year and would gladly put Alcus Hudson up against any of the 'big boys' like Rob Thomas, etc. Finally, somebody that didn't fall into the ""boy band"" vocal trap and sounds so good... the only thing better being he wrote every song."
1,EL'LAMO,"With the jolting of the camera as filming in a California earthquake,this movie is a twister and if not for a few of the ""actors"" its a burner.Hablo es spaniel,you better i dont and am still trying to figure out why a russian is involved.The one night high and of course a one night stand is the whole story,between two males jacking eachother off unseen after sniffing glue is it.The music in some aspect is okay except the squealling of one bad banshee and some kind of lullaby lesbians song that doesnt fit.You will be lost in circles but if you pay attention you might learn some spanish.The main revues are from family members or from the director,ask John Waters to do your next one."
1,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING,"What you read is not what you get. Usually, AMAZON and viewers reviews are a good guideline to choosing what to buy. Not this time. Very tame movie; definitely not what I was expecting. Nothing really gay about it, either; just a couple of high, male teenagers, supposedly going at it. It reminded me of movies of older times: you see a little un-sexy kissing at the beginnig of ""the"" scene and then cut to the next day. So, if what you are looking for is hot sex scenes, look elsewhere."
5,Rare footage!,"This too short VHS contains footage of some of Jordan Belson's films that are not available elsewhere. If you ever have the chance to see any of his film, go!"
5,Great resource for all teachers,"This is an excellent resource for teachers of writing, or for teachers who would like to effectively implement writing into their classrooms. The authors include many helpful tips and the research behind them. The writing style is efficient and clear, and overall, the book is easy to navigate. Although the information is geared toward college level teachers, I found this helpful as an elementary teacher, and it is even more applicable for secondary education. One of the best teaching resources I've found on teaching writing."
5,"Great, challenging Puzzle","No, this is not a 3D puzzle - and one has to wonder why you'd think that it was. This was an entertaining, challenging, educational puzzle that was fun to complete. One piece was missing and the company sent a new puzzle at no charge - now that's great customer service. Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful Children's Book,"One of my favorite books as a kid, very well written. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has young children who like to be read a story."
5,Love this burcket,I bought this as a gift and they use it for washing their car and said it is great and does not bend or splash water out.
1,"Bad Product, don't buy","I bought this product with the idea that it was going to soften and actually moisturize and take the frizz out of my hair. Well, it did the total opposite, it made my hair very stiff, dry and when I tried to flat iron it, it didn't take the frizz out of my hair at all. I am an African American woman with very dry, thick and frizzy hair. I really wanted to believe that this product would actually work on my thick, dry, curly and frizzy hair. But, it didn't. This product was very cheap. It was on sale and I only paid $5 something for it plus tax . This is junk in a bottle. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
1,old products,"beware, these are very old products! I made the mistake of purchase 3 bottles and cannot/would not use them after realizing that they are probably several years old. the balm becomes dry and flaky in your hair and leaves a film. gross. otherwise this is a great product...just don't buy from this seller."
4,Great Product,"I love this product. It is does what it is supposed to do - keeps your hair as straight as when you styled it. I have thick, coarse hair and it lasts all night - and I gave it to a friend who has thin hair - and it worked well with her hair texture as well. Not heavy and smells great. And doesn't weigh your hair down. Only thing is - it doesn't work with just blow-drying your hair straight - you must use a straightening iron. But other than that - I adore this product!"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I guess I was expecting this movie to be a more modern version of a classic ""who dunnit"" type of film with new twists (sort of a modern version of Agatha Christie's classic ""Murder on the Orient Express"") to keep the viewers attention span.Instead, however, this movie is more of a suspense/thriller... Take a naive, married couple with marital troubles deciding to travel across Siberia to Moscow. They met up with another couple (complete strangers, I might add) traveling the same route they are. The strangers are odd from the start and you suspect that something bad will happen and of course, something bad does occur....The entire plot/storyline is just horrible and cheesy, the married couple does stupid, naive things throughout the entire movie. The movie drags out and the characters act and do things that are strange and don't make sense. Even Woody Harrelson's acting was bad in this movie. This movie was a complete waste of time. No wonder I'd never heard of it before."
2,"The ""Where's the Mystery??"" Train Mystery Movie...","This movie is very, very slow. It takes forever for the set-up to switch gears and get the plot going. From that point on it's only moderately interesting. I recommend watching ""A Simple Plan"" over this. It's a similar of type of film but much, much more exciting and interesting. Woody Harrelson did have provide one or two fun moments in his ""clueless American abroad"" role, but overall, it's just not very satisfying."
3,A SIMMERING POT THAT NEVER BOILS!,"A good cast in this ode to Hitchcock, but despite creating a sense of fear from the unknown, this suspense film never reaches a fever pitch. Although technically well made, I found the story tedious and really couldn't get engrossed in this film. I like these types of movies and this one showed promise, but in the end it just didn't seem worth the ride. It's the kind of film that may appeal more to some than others."
3,Blu Ray,"Well it was ok nothing terribly special. I paid $9.99 so was ok. Suggest you wait for it to go below 10 bux. Having had wonderful experiences as a kid on European Sleep Wagons 'Shlaffvagon' I was a bit dissapointed in the lack of background sound relaying wheels on tracks with a repetative note. Films sound depicting train movement was mostly a humm that could have been a ship on waves. No complaints on the Blu Ray quality. The 5.1 sound didnt amount to much. And finally its not a keeper, once seen your done.If this review was helpful to you at all please vote on it."
4,Great Suspense to the End,Excellent suspense-thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. The cold and bleak Siberian landscape added to the overall mood. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
5,Homage to Hitch,"A young couple, fresh from doing good works, board a train. It could be Guy and Harriet Pringle setting out on a fresh odyssey. The sun is shining and all seems right with the world. But some very nasty surprises are in store for them.This is a brilliant thriller, beautifully filmed and with suspense maintained throughout. I am very happy to award it top marks and will gladly watch it again on many future occasions. It should be recognised, however, that what the filmmakers have craftily done is to stir together the ingredients of three of Alfred Hitchcock's most cherished classics - 'Blackmail', 'The Lady Vanishes' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' - to produce a stand-alone masterpiece which is nevertheless heavily indebted to the work of the old master. (The scene where the helpful policeman very kindly carries the heroine's heavy bag would have delighted him beyond measure!)"
5,Surprisingly excellent!,"I bought the movie because I like Woody Harrelson and my girlfriend dreams of riding on the Transiberian Railroad someday. I was not expecting much from the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. Great script! Great acting all around! No one pulled the movie down. It was a ""real"" movie you could easily imagine happening. It is down to earth and does not have the typical over-the-top Hollywood scenes or edits. One of the best suspense thrillers I have seen. Congratualtions to all involved in making this movie!"
3,coulda been,"had a lot of potential, but got bogged down in silliness, getting people to behave in ways that make no sense, yet are predictable because it is always clear it is a hollywood movie. the final scene was so unbelievable that it was ludicrous. also, apparently noone who was involved in making the movie has ever actually been in below zero weather."
4,"Interesting ""little"" film.","Hard to describe. Not: action; special effects; of great social consequences; thought provoking. Is, some: mystery; drama; cinematography. Not on anyones' top 10 or top 50 or even 500 but worth a look. Guess it could be a ""date"" flick. I did like it because of the actors and scenery."
3,Decent diverson,"Not a great film but has a few moments. Predictable, and a rather poor screen play but as my title says ""decent diversion"". Don't go expecting great things from this movie and you just might find it palatable."
3,Not bad for the price...,"I'd never heard of ""Trans-Siberian"", but bought it really cheap at a well-known bargain department store. The cast intrigued me, and I couldn't resist. I was hoping to see some cool scenery of Siberian landscapes, but I'm sure it wasn't filmed on location. Emily Mortimer is the central character, mostly annoying, and Woody, as her hubby, was vapid, sexless and nave. Most interesting were Eduardo Noriega and Kate Mara, as an enigmatic couple they meet on the title train. Intrigue ensues, and Ben Kingsley appears, with dubious concern. It was a fairly interesting ride, and had moments of true interest, but, overall, quite routine. Noriega's smarmy charm gave him the best character, and he was quite fine. Twist ending was interesting. Director Brad Andrson has done better."
1,A movie that frustrates the watcher,This movie was very frustrating to watch. The acting was not bad but the screenplay is what failed to deliver in this case. The sequence of events added up to me being frustrated shouting out why would you do that ect... This is a movie that if you like being frustrated or characters making poor decisions then you may like it but for me it was just too much stupidity to put up with. 2 stars at best in my book. Wait for it on a premium channel don't waste your money on a rental for it.
1,"Wow. This movie sucked. Slow plot, lousy acting and direction.","Carlos and Jessie made this ""slow mover"" an absolute stinker. I hated this amateur effort so much, that I don't want to elaborate. Normally, I'd give away spoilers for a movie that sucked as much as this; but it's not worth the effort. Just look at the prices for the used DVDs (108 at 0.43 each) and that will tell you all you need to know."
4,Decent thriller,"The Bottom Line:Some of the events in Transsiberian stretch plausibility to the breaking point (especially when characters spend lots of time barefoot in the snow) but that's fairly commonplace in thrillers so I recommend that you sit back and enjoy the fine acting, tense situations, and interesting character detail in this ride along the transsiberian railway.3/4"
4,twists that I didn't imagine,"downloaded this movie to watch on my Kindle Fire, during a flight. good scenery, good plot. twists at the end kept me guessing. i thought it was really good."
1,fianna's clothes are naughty but she's not a hottie.............,fianna is acting all cool putting discusting clothes on and she is SUPER ugly. and OMG where's her pants on that card? yuck! i dont see any.......
4,Awesome,"Hi, I got this doll for my birthday, and she is beatiful. Her hair looks a lot better in real life. I'm 11 10/12, and I love bratz. I don't belive that the clothes are ""naughty"", I believe they're beautiful and sophisticated. Everything is well made except the pefume bottle that is meant for you to put the perfume in. Mine's top always falls off. Oh, well, it smells good. People have different opinions, so if you don't like this doll, don't get her. I recomend her for collectors and slightly older children.-Emily"
1,What?,"What did they do to her? She looks terrible! I don't know why she looks like this,but I'd do something about it! MGA made her look like she is copycating Cloe!"
1,fianna can't sleep over........,I think this kind of stuff is for 11 and 14 year olds not 6 and 10 year olds.and amazon said 6 and 10 but.....I still think young kids aren't ready.the things that come with this doll.
3,You call this a Bratz?,"When I went to toys ""r"" us, I thougt it would be a great doll, but it sucks! The eyes are so skinny and ugly, but the clothes are not bad. Flashback Bratzs are way, way better then this, well, only a little! Mattle, you could have had this doll look better! And lower priced! I don't recomend this UGLY DOLL! From Daniella!!!!!"
1,Her shirt--ugh!!!!!!!!!!,"HER SHIRT!!! I HATE IT! IT MAKES HER LOOK PREGNANT AND FAT, LIKE SUPER FAT!!! HOW COULD ANYBODY EVER SAY THIS DOLL'S SHIRT IS CUTE?? R U BLIND??? CAN U NOT C HOW FAT IT MAKES HER LOOK?? MOST OF THE BRATZ DOLLS LOOK ANOREXIC, BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T--SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE NEEDS 2 B. JEEZUS DON'T THEY EVER LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THIS????!!"
5,Fun and Gorgeous!,"I have this doll, and I love her. I don't understand why everyone thinks she is so ugly?! BTW, if you had good, pure eye-sight, you would see on the card that she is wearing pretty light pink pants. I know, because I have her. She comes with two comfy cozy bottoms (silk like material) and two comfy cozy shirts (silk like material) and a comfy robe that is also silk like material. Her shoes are cool because they have real ribbons and beads on them. And the bare feet are really cute. You won't be dissapointed!PS: END THE RIDICULOUS DOLL WAR!!!"
1,AAAAHHH!ALIE..Oh wait.Thats a head..,"When I looked at the body I thought she might be seriously cute in the head shot,ya know? But when me and my brother(he supervises what I go to) clicked on the head shot,he wet his pants. (He says don't laugh.I say laugh) And he is 16!!!So she is freaking ugly and I say don't buy the doll.For your laundry's sake.Parents beware of the pant-wetting horror from The Box!!!!!!!"
1,fianna can't sleep over........,I think this kind of stuff is for 11 and 14 year olds not 6 and 10 year olds.and amazon said 6 and 10 but.....I still think young kids aren't ready.the things that come with this doll.and if you ask me agian finna can't sleep over but.. she can sleep at my house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
5,Best Album,"Dem's Good Beeble is probably still their best selection of songs to date (every song's a gem) but Ghosts of Hallelujah is probably their best album. It has several classics songs (like in Beeble) but the order of the songs make it their most cohesive. The opener ""Up On High"" (one of Jimmy's best) and the closer ""Lowlands"" (one of Kevin's best) give it it's shape. The mini WHO like rock opera ""Bean Bowl"", ""My Time, Yer Time"" and ""Son Of Bum"" makes perfect sense and helps cement the feel of this album. (And Grieven' & Smokin' is just a great Gourds tune.)"
3,nicely done,Small holographic inserts complement the large illustrations in this tale of three bored ghosts who have haunted their castle so well that no one will visit anymore. They are forced to look for a new place to haunt and eventually light upon an amusement park ride that needs them as much as they need it.
5,hilarious!,"This was wildly entertaining. I can't wait for more in the series to be released. Buy it, now!"
1,where's the letters or find me a magnifying glass,i agree with serious lee from california. the letters are lower case and toooo close together. save your $ and get the cryptogram magazines found at your local newstand. iam amazed at the 4 & 5 stars for a tiny over-priced book withtheletterstooclosetogether.
1,DON'T THESE PEOPLE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY?,Print is so small and in a serif font that the only way I can work the puzzles is to enlarge the pages to 200% with my copying machine. This is absurd.
3,Bad font,"Enjoyed the quotes. The single bad feature of this book is the terrible font. They should change it so there is more room to write above the letters. The font takes variable space depending on the width of the letter. For instance, there isn't room to print a ""W"" over the narrow ""i."" One thing I liked was that the quotes were printed in normal capital and lower case letters. Helped me decide when a single letter word was an ""a"" or an ""i."" Most of these books I have had print everything in upper case, making them a tiny bit more challenging."
4,Good flick through and through!,"Things I liked about this film:The CG is very well done.It captured the 'total war' essence of the first movie.The pace of the movie is relentless; once the action begins, it never slows down.Things I didn't like about this film:The script, while good for what it is, doesn't capture the full feel of the culture of the first movie. Interesting in and of itself.(SPOILER ALLERT!)Allmost all the new charicters, most of them very interesting, die. If the creators of this film plan on makeing a sequel, I'd have liked to see more of them survive."
4,Worth it....,"I really enjoy the Starship Trooper series and I was definitely not disappointed with ST: Invasion. I was't sure about it being animated but the animation was extremely well done. Bottomline, it is worth watching and i hope they continue the ST series."
3,A bit disappointed,"At first I thought this was going to be a great addition to my Starship Troopers collection. Should have read the small print. The animated movie was okay but I wanted to see real folks playing their parts. I did like the series 1-3, three where John Rico returned to the battle. I guess the makers did not want to pay the actors for another round, so they voiced over animation. As an animated movie, it was okay but did not have the corny dialog additions as the series. I missed the ""do you want to know more"" and the one liners with perfect timing was missing. If you wanted the human involvement you will be disappointed. If you like animation it will not disappoint, however, I still think the makers could have used actors in the movie."
2,Disappointed,"Not as good as I thought it would be, could have been better if it was a ""real"" movie with ""real"" people, and not like a game!!!critic"
2,Not like the real ones,"Did't like it, it was a cartoon not the real thing...I didn't realize it never noticed it on the intro..!!"
3,Starship Troopers: Invasion,hard to keep viewing the show for all the reloading stream matter. I thought I was buying a hard copy dvd not making a view library.
1,Cartoon actors suck,"I like Robert A. Heinlein and the first two REAL movies. If you are a cartoon buff, then maybe this is for you. I like people in movies - computer generated characters more or less advertised as real actors are very poor. It works for special effects in high budget movies, but the graphics are not that great in this one. I will look much more carefully at the credits and whether there are actors or cartoons starring in the movie. I would have given this a ""0"" if it was available. I watched 10 minutes and turned it off it sucked so bad."
3,okay movie,I didn't realize that this a a cartoon version. Enjoyed the movie but wished it was not the cartoon version.
3,Disappointing,"I was hoping that CGA had made some gains since CGA movies first came out. This movie has the same ""not quite"" lifelike characters with guns the size of tanks that never run out of bullets, voices from the Whorf School of Deep Talking, women that teenage boys dream about, and a kill everything in sight plot. Disappointing."
4,I enjoyed it despite,"a terrible delivery system via amazon. I have a very fast connection but despite that the film was choppy and the volume too low.Kudos to the team that brought this film to life, I really enjoyed it and will probably buy the dvd to get a better viewing experience than was possible with amazon's overloaded delivery servers."
1,Starship Troopers: Invasion,I did not realize this DVD was an animation. I don’t like real life cartoons because I have a hard time taking them seriously.
2,digital movie,"The movie was stupid, good effects but I just dont care for digitally enhanced movies. It make is to cartoonie like."
3,was disappointed,The CGI on this one SUCKS!!!! Big Time!!!! I was expecting a live action movie when I heard of this sequel to the sequel to the sequel of the original. I was totally disappointed with both the CGI and the storyline and really wish I hadn't wasted the money I spent on it. :(
2,Yuck,"didnt kow it was animation hate animation, if you like animation good luck not for me though watched 15 minutes gave up"
2,"not great, but better than the sequels","animation for this was good, but the story didn't live up to it. i don't mind nudity, it goes with anime often, but it just seemed to be dropped in here. the characters are cookie cutter, nothing really original, but it was still better than the lame sequels."
5,A LOT better then what I thought it was going to be,"This CGI movie was very good... SO~ much better then I had thought it was going to bethe CGI work is pretty good, maybe not as good as other movies, yes.But still did a really good job with it and if you are a fan of Science fiction Video games and moviesyou WILL see a lot of them in this movie. from what I saw it has.HaloGears of WarKillZoneMass EffectDead SpaceAlienLost PlanetAnd if you don't and/or didn't see them, I don't know how you would miss them?But Starship Troopers: Invasion was one of the BEST Starship Troopers movies to come out since the first one and I hoping to see another one done CGI."
2,Do NOT recommend,"I didn't realize this was a cartoon, and a not very good one at that. I really enjoyed the 3 movies, but this thing is not worth watching."
4,Great but not awesome,This CGI was surprisingly good. Obviously nothing can compare to the original movie but this is a quality entry in the starship troopers line of films. Lots of fan service with appearances from the big players.
3,"Yes, Another One","So I bought this as I own the other 3 Starship Troopers, and it was good (not great, but good). It was better than #3 and if you were a fan of the original, I recommend checking this out."
3,It's a cartoon....,"Which was to bad. Nice animation....but, the sound wasawful. All hard to understand. I just couldn't enjoy themovie; because I had a hard time, understanding whatthey were saying. If it hadn't been for that, I would havegiven it a four star rating."
2,Severely disappointing,"I love the Starship Troopers series. I was on it since I watched them filming the first one out here by my place in the 90s. This one is so disappointing. I was willing to give an animated sequel a shot, but it isn't even good animation. The entire thing looks and feels like a seriously bad ""Halo"" cut scene, straight out of 10 years ago. Save your money, you'll be happier if you just stick with the trilogy."
2,"this movie is cheap,,junk,","this movie is not worth nothing, junk so don;t waste your money buying it , poorly made,,bad acting bad seince"
1,"It's a cartoon, not a movie","There should be a huge disclaimer that this is just a cartoon, or animation or what have you. It's not worth the trouble to watch it."
2,I didn't know it was all cg,I loved the original Starship Troopers. I rented this movie not realizing it was an animated feature. The animation only made the poor dialogue stand out. There is no chemistry between the characters on screen. This movie would have been much better if they had used live actors.
2,Starship Trooper: Invasion HD,"Really wasn't what I expected. I didn't care for the flick and it didn't keep my intrest. I'm sure others will like, guess I was expecting a movie like Orginal Starship Troopers..."
2,Cartoons can do things people cannot,Formula kill the bug rescue survivors and whatever you do keep them off the Earth.Looks like they could not afford to keep making pictures with people and needed to switch to cartoons. This could also make a good advertisement for a game.You can see that this was made after the films as it is more of an extension of the films than an attempt to recreate the original writing. They were able to completely strip the film of any original thought that that Robert A. Heinlein was trying to express.What is even weirder is the voice over commentary of the film where they say they are trying to be true to the book. However I suspect they only read the first film script and have no idea that there was a book.Bottom line better suits cheaper dialog with a Japanese feel.Starship Troopers
3,"It's ok, but","I wish that someone would make a version that is faithful to the book, which I have frequently read since 1960 (including every patrol that I made on two SSBNs). And then there's CGI female nudity, ""what the hell?"" as Walter would say. I mean, why?Then Carl says a line right out of DUNE????I do watch the Starship Trooper movies, I love "" space kickers "", however, all of them have been an insult to the book and its author ."
1,Worst 10 dollars i have ever spent,Should have stopped the movie after 15 minutes but I kept hoping it would get better. By far the worst starship troopers yet.
4,Worth watching,"I got a chance to go to the free screening at SDCC last week and it was definitely a fun movie. It's directed by Shinji Aramaki of Appleseed & Appleseed: Ex Machina, as well as Halo Legends. I'm going to add it to my collection!"
2,Very disappointing,"If you haven't already bought this movie, you should seriously consider waiting for it to come out on commercial TV. They'll cut all of the nudity out, but it's CGI animation, so no big loss there. To give the program its due, the storyline is not bad. The movie incorporates a lot of CGI action sequences that are fun to watch. In addition, there are a number of memorable characters, traditional (Rico, Ibanez and Karl) as well as new (Trig, Hero and Chou, among others). However, the CGI animation is way over-used. It seems like the director is attempting to meld live actors with the CGI animation. However, the attempt fails miserably, primarily because he uses CGI for everything. Sadly, the fact that he used neither real sets or real actors in non-CGI animated roles, makes the movie appear more like an online video game rather than a serious movie. Bottom line: as produced, this movie was very disappointing in spite of the fact that many of the characters had great potential."
2,It's a cartoon,"I rented this movie expecting a live action science fiction movie. I was wrong, it's a cartoon and not a very good one at that."
1,It was BAD,My son even got board. I was bad grafics and even worse was the storI tu4ned itnoff half way through.
3,Good concept poor execution,"This is not a bad ""movie"" the problem is that it's just a story within the universe. There is no real ""bigger picture"" to this movie so it feels like a very long episode in a series rather than a standalone. The beginning lags a bit for no apparent reason except to show naked cartoon women. In a cartoon movie it's kind of a cheesy thing to do but in anime they apparently do it a lot.Otherwise it's decently done. I own the other 3 and don't have a problem with any of them, I probably won't buy this one. Worth a rental if you can stand animated movies (the cgi kind not the hand drawn style). The animation is really well done, it's just nothing new story-wise or graphically.3.3 stars...better than average worse than pretty good."
1,Not for me,"Im thinking that maybe this computer generated movie and story were not so good. I turned it off half way through, I just couldnt take it any longer. Have to give this one only 1 star..for effort."
1,rotten cartoon,"this was a major waist of money, not worth the time. so if you haven't seen it you are better off. two thumbs down or better yet i cut my hands off."
1,"Terrible, painful to watch","Bad CGI, equivalent to an old video game intro.Bad voice acting.Bad plot and story line.Bad everything.Adding a nude shower scene makes it bad for kids.I liked the Starship Troupers movies, I like animated films. I did not like this at all, it was painful to watch.Buyer beware."
1,Cartoon,"I didn't realize I was renting a cartoon. I want my money back!!! I'm sorry, I just couldn't watch it."
2,lazy and pedestrian,"didn't expect much, was still disappointed. Dialog written by 14yr old call of duty players. Japanese style anime exposition with western cheese, managed to get the worst of both worlds."
3,Just what I expected,I enjoyed the first Starship Troopers movies but hated all the sequels. This 3D animated sequel is actually the best of the sequels and had its good points. No real character development but fun action.
5,A worthy successor to the first film.,"I feel compelled to write a review after reading many of the negative reviews here on Amazon. So to clarify things, yes it is a ""CG Animated Film"". I suppose that can be a deal breaker for some. However if you can get past that, you will see a good movie that does an excellent job of staying true to the original Starship Troopers. The CG is very well done and in many scenes, it can be mistaken for a ""live action"" movie. Overall it seemed like everything fit in with the Starship Troopers Universe and I got the feeling that the creators of this film were huge fans of the series. If you liked the novel or the first movie and can ""accept"" or even enjoy a good CG animated film, then I definitely recommend this one!"
3,Starship Troopers contiued,If you are a fan of the series you will probably like this one too. It is CGI but there is plenty of bug killing and a little bit of story just like all the other ones.
4,OK for Starship,This movie was better than the two sequels that came out. Although if someone has never seen the series might be a little lost on some of the characters. If you liked this movie check out the short lived animated series. That was very good as well. I am confused though why they put nudity in this movie but whatever. If you're a fan you'll like this.
2,Kind of Stupid,"Ok, there are enough reviews already so you can get an idea what to expect from this flick so let me instead ask a question. How is it that a crowd of troopers, standing on level ground, with dozens and of their own men standing several layers deep directly in front of them can all fire straight ahead and not tear the men standing in front of them into bits? That's the kind of laziness this film is filled with - mediocre CGI and lazy direction lacking any kind of coherent story. You can get away with this in a video game because at least you get to spend your time just blowing stuff up, but in a movie it gets boring pretty fast. It's a shame that the Starship Troopers movies keep accelerating down hill.Still waiting for a film version that sticks much more closely to the book. At this rate it isn't going to be happening any time soon."
1,Animated??,Guess I didn't look close enough before I rented but this is simply an animated movie which is not for me. I will say that it is quality animation but I don't really care.
2,weak animated movie,"This may be ok for teens but it is just another lame space movie, predictable plot, formulaic story. Too much like a Japanese animae. It is what it is."
2,Lost,Wow at a lost why they did it in CG this movie I think it would have been much better if it was live actors.
4,A better chapter in the Troopers saga,"If you are a SST fan then this is for you. Lots of blasting away at hordes of bugs. Introduction of several new kinds of bugs and a high body count. I am trying to avoid spoilers. Some CG nudity, lots of language and tons and tons of violence. For all that it is a little depressing and the story sort of lagged in places. The artwork is AWESOME!"
3,fan review,Ok....I like B-Movies and this series has gone from a A (First one) to a B- real quick.....but I love the buggs....lol...stomp stomp...
4,Starship troopers Invasion animation,"When I first saw this movie I was excited, having watched the other starship trooper movies, however when I discovered it was animation, I felt a wee bit disappointed. That disappointment did not last, however because the story, characters, and even the animation was absolutely enjoyable to watch and intriguing to follow. This turned out to be a great story. Not for kids, this is animation for adults. Very very good. I liked it."
3,Animated,I guess I missed something in the description because I didn't know it was animated. The animation was pretty good and the gory details were well represented but I missed the reality feel of regular film.
2,Dissapointing,"You really need to be a SicFic fan to enjoy the Trooper series. First, it was disapointing to see an animation, although well done. It would have been nice to get a warning in the Amaszon sales pitch that it was anima and not live action.The movie had some of the same grit as the first, but the underlying themes weren't there. Kinda how they ruined the Robo Cop series.Nice T&A, fair on killing bugs."
3,this movie is ok,this movie is ok for a cgi movie wish i waited tell it was a 1.99 though.i want even go into detail on the story line its justif u seen one starship troopers u seen them all in this one is no diffrent...
3,Solid enough entertainment,"Voice acting is key here, and the actors do pretty well going along with the animated features and movements of the characters. There are tons of battle scenes but a story is in there somewhere as well."
4,Starship Troopers Invasion,"i guess i didn't read the promo ad close enough because when i received the movie it was animated.i don't like animated stuff much but i watched it.plot was OK and the animation is great.i still would have preferred to see real actors.looking forward to more ""Troopers."""
2,Not like the first movie it is CG,"Computer generated characters look great, the story is a little strange and gets weirder by the minute. If you like Japanese Anime you will like it otherwise not that good and I usually am not too critical on this type of movie."
4,Good movie,"Good show. Well worth watching, great computer animation. Good story line. Good addition to the Starship Troopers movie. Liked the bugs, they looked pretty cool"
1,not what you think,did not relize this movie was animated did not finish movie previews look like regular movie my mistake i have they other regular movies
3,Well...,"The story behind this flick is decent, but the CGI could've been better.... It's not as good as the first, or third, and not even half as bad as the second. Overall, I'd have to say watch it."
3,starship troopers invasion,thought it was like the other movies but its a cartoon. it was ok but it could of been better if you use real people like the other movies
2,Please don't spend $50+ on this.....,I got one of these on clearance for $5 at a Toys R Us. Please don't spend a huge amount of money on this. The asking price listed here is pure price gouging.
2,Nothing more than a review,"I expected a little bit more songs during performances by the band, than reviewers talking most of the time. All songs get interrupted all the time.Very disappointed"
5,R.E.M.'s best,"New Adventures in Hi-Fi is the greatest album ever.I love every song on it which includes in my opinion R.E.M.'s greatest single, E bow the letter. I really love how they seemed to combine Automatic for the People and Monster to make this amazing album. If you don't have it yet go out this minute and pick it up,you won't be disappointed."
3,I almost didn't listen to this one. . .,"When I first heard ""How the West was Won....,"" I nearly took the CD out of the player and used it as a Frisbee. After deciding to give it a chance (and avoid punishment) I found that it was actually pretty good. New Test Leper is one of the best songs I'd heard in a long time. This one isn't my favourite, but it's not bad by any means."
3,The End of REM,"NAIHF is by no means a bad album. Still, it is the record that largely drained REM of their fanbase.After a career full of intelligent risks, the band flew too close to the sun by releasing ""E-Bow"" as the first single. Big mistake. In today's music landscape, that kind of self-sabotage just can't be overcome (as evidenced by the lackluster public response to NAIHF). Had REM started with ELECTROLITE, the quirkiness of this record probably would've been easier for the casual fan to digest.Anyway, weird or not, the album does have some real gems. ELECTROLITE, LEAVE, BE MINE, and WAKE-UP BOMB are great, while BITTERSWEET ME and even E-BOW manage to be good.Other songs like DEPARTURE, HOW THE WEST WAS WON and ZITHER are well, uhh, courageous efforts shall we say..."
3,Worth Your Time,"Not really an album. but more a bunch of sound checks and out takes. Nevertheless, there are great songs present that would easily make the cut on any R.E.M. album. My personal favorites are ""Leper,"" ""Electrolite"" and ""Bittersweet Me."" There are other great ones too. Not bad for a ""throw away"" album."
3,Interesting,"Simply put, this album is kind of boring. For the most part, there is only a bit of discernable melody in the songs. However, IMO, it's a huge improvement from Monster. The lyrics of most of the songs on this album are very interesting, and there are some nice melodies here and there. For example, New Test Leper and Be Mine are very nice and melodic songs. Overall, I'd say that the album is worth buying, but you might as well save some money and buy it used."
5,R.E.M.'s Most Underrated Album,"For most people, ""Automatic For the People"" and ""Out of Time"" come to mind as R.E.M.'s most memorable albums of the decade. We definitely shouldn't forget about ""New Adventures In Hi-Fi."" It's hard to make an album with so many songs without even a few of them being filler. That's not the case here. Each song on this CD is a gem. This is one of the few instances in which an ambitious effort actually hits the bullseye."
5,The Best REM CD ever!,"This is truly the best REM CD that I have ever listened to. It is so calm and relaxing yet is also reflects the true calabor of REM's rocking ability. This is my favorite CD to listen to while I do homework, or as I try to fall asleep. The songs do not distract me, they are absolutely delightful to listen to. My favorite track on the album is song #6 LEAVE. There is no other song in the world like this one. It starts out calm and peaceful...almost like a classical music piece, but then it turns into an amazing rock song. Every song, from the first to the last, flow together evenly and beautifully. Although not much ""radio attention""` was given to this song, it deserves to be recognized and enjoyed. The fact that none of the songs on this Cd were over played on the radio makes this CD so much more enjoyable and fresh. New Adventures in Hi-Fi ranks within my top 5 CDs of all time. It is a definate must have for any REM fan!"
3,New adventures in emptiness,"This album is much like a chocolate eclair filled with hot peppers; the first few listenings are incredibly enjoyable, but when you get down to it, its just plain bad. Not to say there are no redeeming ponts to this album: How the West was Won and Where it Got Us, Be Mine, Electrolyte, and E-bow the Letter (possibly one of the best REM songs of all time) are very solid songs; however, its the rest of the album that is not up to par.The rest of the album is filled with songs that sound like a band that's tired of touring. Also, its the first album by REM that features a terrible sound effect (those infernal sirens on ""Leave"") that would be later repeated on Reveal. Leave, Wake-Up Bomb, Too Fast, Too Numb, and New Test Leper are less than or equal to Can't Get There From Here for WORST REM SONG of ALL TIME.This album represents the beginning of the end of a great band, but it is better than Up or Reveal because at least Peter Buck and Mike Mills are still audible."
1,No memorable tracks,"""Thinking man's record""? People only apply those three words to albums that nobody would like otherwise unless they labeled it as something ""challenging"". If you have to force something down your own throat, it ain't good. There's a time when people should realize when they need to give up on a record, or else they're just kidding themselves. You can't fake liking something, so I don't know why people keep saying this stuff ""grows on you"". There's nothing special or fresh about ""New Adventures"". And what's so bad about radio hits? Maybe if you think you're better than the average Joe, you could say that you hate a band's radio hits, but unless you're that egotistical, there's no reason to say it."
3,Another REM album release disappointment,"Being a REM fan for some time and listening to most of the band's albums I came across this release on Amazon.com. I have to be honest and state I have tried to give this CD and its tracks a fair go but personally cannot find a song that appeals to me.And that's a problem for me. Usually with any REM album I find a song or a few songs I like but in this album I definitely could not. This is my personal view, many people may like this album and I suppose to each his or her own.I just feel that REM could have done much better and their effort was wasted in this release."
3,DECENT EFFORT FROM R.E.M.,"This album was written while touring 'Monster'. This album is Bill Berry's last with R.E.M.. When it came out I thought it was the best R.E.M. album then but now I don't. 'Automatic for the People' is the best they have done. This album is still good and I will always recommend it to everyone who likes R.E.M.. It has some really good tracks like: 'Electrolite', 'Leave', 'E-Bow the Letter' which features Patti Smith. 'Bittersmeet Me' and 'Be Mine' are also good.And now the negative part, 'How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us' has to be the worst ever opening track from R.E.M. 'Zither' is instrumental, it's ok but nothing special. Undertow and Low Desert are very heavy compared to earlier works, some may like them but I don't.If you are new to R.E.M., then pass on this for a while and buy 'Out of Time' or 'Green'."
5,Impressive,"I won't waste much time babbling about how I found out what a talented band R.E.M. is because everybody here has their own story about discovering their music and knows what I'm talking about. All I'll say is that it took me a while to finally get around to buying one of their albums and I now wish I had sooner. I have never walked away from this album without being impressed. If you are thinking about checking this out, this is an occasion where I can say that any real music fan should do just that. In case you're wondering, I grabbed ""New Adventures"" first because I liked how weird some of the songs I had heard were. It's also Michael's favorite. The cover of a desert scene erieely lines up perfectly with the music. It amazes me that they were able to just incoporate a sound that just places you in that atmosphere. As for the closing, ""Electrolite"", they knew it was classic from the beginning....."
5,"R.E.M.'s best record since ""Green""","During 1995's explosive ""Monster"" tour, R.E.M. recorded tracks which became the album ""New Adventures In Hi-Fi"". Some songs were recorded live during the band's concerts, while others were recorded during soundchecks and a few were cut in the studio. And it turns out that ""Hi-Fi"" combined a lot of styles that R.E.M. has used in past albums. Some songs were soft and acoustic like those off 1992's ""Automatic For The People"", while others were fast and loud like the songs that dominated ""Monster"". It also turns out that ""Hi-Fi"" has been R.E.M.'s most underrated album. It's better than the smash hit records ""Out of Time"", ""Automatic For The People"", and ""Monster"", which is unfortunate. Many people have missed out on this excellent record. My favorites from this album are 'E-Bow The Letter', 'Electrolite', 'The Wake-Up Bomb', 'Departure', and my favorite R.E.M. song of all-time - 'Bittersweet Me'."
4,5.1 - DTS - Surround,Excellent 5.1 mix. The release sounds fantastic in surround - highly recommended if you're a fan of the album/band & an audiophile.
2,Their first bad album,"I didn't think they could do it, but they finally released a clunker -- New Adventures in Hi-Fi is not only their worst album; It's their most disappointing. It was supposed to be their spontaneous, easy-to make record, the one they wanted to make, instead of being constantly forced to change their sound. Unfortunately, all they could come up with is a lame hybrid of ""Automatic"" and ""Monster."" I still think ""Monster"" is underrated, but it's pretty much accepted that ""Automatic"" was the band's best post-IRS record. New R.E.M. that still kicked. With ""Monster"" they changed sounds, added some wit. With ""New Adventures""...they sound Tired, uninteresting. It really is their Chicago XXVI, their Adult Contemporary album. The band, when Berry packed his bags to farm, should have broken up instead of sissolving into a rock act. Well, we still have Reckoning."
2,"Mediocre ""Adventures""","With their second consecutive largely uninteresting album (musically anyway), R.E.M. officially joins the ranks of the has-beens. It was a great ride while it lasted. Few rock bands have released as many fine albums as they. Much has been made of the harrwoing and heart-felt lyrics on this one. Maybe so, but if the music is second rate the lyrics won't save it, especially from a band that used to deliberately obscure what they were singing. R.E.M. has gotten less interesting as Michael Stipe's vocals have become clearer. Unfortunately, these ""Adventures"" are the result of that trend."
3,Their good version of bad,"NAIHF is a good example of a strong R.E.M. album in their (freshly entered) mediocrity phase, offering a lengthy album virtually filled to the brim with mildly engaging pleasantries, the occasional bristling chorus or guitar line, but very few wholly satisfying tracks. In fact the only entire song I consider must-hear is ""Be Mine"", even if these new adventures hardly reek of the post-Berry, electro-vacancy follow-ups would yield."
2,im old school,"Im an old school REM fan and could never get over what they became on the abysmal Document release and the ensuing decent into sheer goof-dom and commercial goo with most of their 90's material. That said, there are two of my favorite REM tunes on this album: Be Mine and Electrolyte. Be mine is one of the greatest songs Ive ever heard."
2,Flat album,"This album might just be a little better than Out Of Time but hardly by much. The album is very long, songs are wander aimlessly with no hooks or melodies. I still can't retain any song in my head despite owning this album for 5 years.Too much experimentation without structure is what I put it down to.There is really nothing I can say here other than this release is very flat."
4,Not among their best,"But still better than 99.9% of what's out there.The band sounds a little fried and weary to me. Some of the songs are among their best work - Leave, Electrolyte, and particularly Be Mine - but overall it's a little lacking.Of course, the standards REM has set are so high that it's hard for me to be truly objective. This is the best American Band of all time (with possible exception of Allman Brothers.) On a strictly comparative basis, New Adventures is not up there with most of the IRS collection or Automatic or Up."
5,"classic no nonsense music, that is a downright masterpiece","How can one band make so many good songs, I mean most bands should be able to base a career on one song of this quality, but not REM they give us their fifth album in a row without a bad song on it. They have also finally managed to write a song as good as country feedback, in Elecrolite. If the first 3 songs were each a minute shorter this would be faultless"
5,"Brilliant, R.E.M. tones down it's sound and finds glory","As an avid R.E.M. fan I had long looked forward to R.E.M.'s folow up to ""Automatic for the people"" however i was very disappointed with ""monster"". However R.E.M.'s ""new adventures"" is brilliant, a musical escepade through life filled with wonderful instrumental sections. Whether Michael Stipe plays the character of a premodana(""the wake up bomb"") or that of someone saerching for faith(""new test leper""), it is brilliant."
4,It's about time,"It took me the longest time to actually buy this album. I love every other REM album I own and I think they are all equally great. This is one band that it's hard to pick a favorite album to.New Adventures in Hi Fi got me hooked on the first song and the album cover art too. I had a feeling it would be just as good as the others I own by them. Funny how cover art can influence my purchase, it is a really cool cover, all dark and dramatic.It took a couple listens to realize, yup, I like it just as much as the rest and maybe one day more being one of their more unheard of albums. I tend to like stuff that isn't a bands biggest work. A few more albums to get by REM and I will have them all!"
4,I wish I could give it 5 stars,"The song Leave is almost worth 5 stars alone, and the rest of the first 8 tracks are all brilliant. After that, though, I find it running together and that's why it's only worth 4 stars. New Test Leper was my favorite song on here for a long time, and then a few months ago I got it out for the first time in about a year and realized how great Leave is. That's not to say New Test Leper isn't still great. Also fantastic is How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us, and, as I said, the others of the first 8 tracks. This is much better than Monster, and, in my opinion, the second best REM CD after Automatic for the People, but I've never been a huge REM fan. Still, I think this is definitely worth the purchase price."
5,My favorite!,"I'm not a huge R.E.M fan, so I'll never understand the hardcore ones slamming this album, but I can't remember ever being so excited about an album as I was for this back in grade 6. I remember seeing the video for ""E-Bow the Letter"" and I was astounded: I'm not sure what it was (as I was pretty much into the slate, dull grunge of the time), but something about that song and video really spoke to me and I was hugely excited about getting the album. Needless to say, even looking back now, I still think this is a wonderful album by a wonderful band. Mostly a hodge-podge of live and studio recordings, I find this run of songs to be rock solid and I love them all. Great work! Don't be a fool and miss it, it's an awesome record!"
4,An album full of adventure and magic,"Another case of don't believe the bad reviews. The band experiment with a couple of electronic rhythms and there is a huge backlash, very predictable.This is a very good, and most of all, consistent album. Some songs are very rock like sounding like they could have easily been on 'Monster' whereas others sound like they were meant to be on 'Up' and others sound like classic REM. It sounds great to me.The Patti Smith led 'E-Bow the letter' is always a great listen and 'Electrolite' is classic REM and a brilliant song to sing with at their concerts. There's only about one or two average tracks on here, the rest are great REM songs.Again, written at a time of turmoil for the group when Bill Berry left, so fans were feeling slightly uneasy and this may have led to undue criticism of this fine album."
4,The New Pageant,"I just recently listened to this record again and have to say that I think it contains some of REM's best work since Pageant. The only songs I could have done without are ""Departure"" ""Binky the Doormat"" and ""Low Desert"". ""Bittersweet Me"" and ""The Wake-Up Bomb"" are classic REM songs that show that REM can rock in different ways then the distortion drenched sounds of Monster. I think if REM had edited the album down a little more, this would be their 90s equivalent of Pageant with an updated sound."
3,A Change.,"Somewhat disappointing, but does have its strong points. This CD has a much sadder and darker sound than their previous music. Patti Smith adds to the haunting sound of E-Bow the Letter. Other good songs are Leave, Bittersweet Me, and Electrolite. The other songs are just not up to what R.E.M. is capable of. How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us, and Be Mine are fair attempts but that is about it. Some of the lyrics are just too obscure even for R.E.M.."
2,disappointing,"""Adventures in Hi-Fi"" starts out slow & tepid with ""how the west was won"" & doesn't get any better. The album's best song, ""electrolite"" is the last song on the album. In between those songs is 50 minutes plus of mediocre R.E.M music, with grotesque guitar feedback featured on nearly every song & a few discernable melodies thrown in occassionally. They really should have spent more time at the beach prior to making this unremarkable recording."
2,the decline and fall continues . . .,"The most disappointing aspect of this album is its lack of focus. While REM lyrics have often been inscrutable, the music has been precise and evocative. Here, however, the songs are dull and muddled and repetitious. They've become drunk on distortion and use it to mask the inadequate melodies and arrangements. As hard as they may try, they are not David Bowie, Iggy Pop, T. Rex, or Mott the Hoople, and the glam accoutrements need to go. Skip directly to the last song, Electrolite, if you want to get a taste of what they're still capable of doing with a song."
5,Mind-boggingly underrated,"I can't claim to be the biggest REM fan; some of their work is impressive (Automatic for the People, Up), some is mediocre (Out of Time, Monster), and some of it is really awful (Reveal, Around the Sun).That said, I think this is easily one of the most underrated album of the nineties.Every song, from start to finish, is not only good, but brilliant. Every song; Automatic for the People is the only other REM album I can think of that can boast this equally.If you're an REM fan, or just a lo-fi fan in general, this is an essential album. Every single track is a key track, although my personal favorites are ""Leave,"" ""Be Mine,"" ""So Fast, So Numb,"" and ""E-Bow the Letter."""
4,Highly Overlooked,"New Adventures In Hi-Fi is made up of songs that had their germination on the road during R.E.M.'s tour in support of Monster. The songs, much like a tour, are all over the musical map. Unlike the sonic guitar sound of Monster, this album has numerous different musical styles. ""The Wake Up Bomb"" has a glam rock feel to it while ""New Test Leper"" has an acoustic basis. ""E-Bow The Letter"" has a droning guitar sound and has back up vocals from one of Michael Stipe's major influences and one of his idols, Patti Smith. She adds an eeriness to song and it contains one of the weirdest lines ever, ""aluminum tastes like fear"". ""Bittersweet Me"" is a great song and ""Zither"" follows their recent tradition of including an instrumental on the album. ""Binky The Doorman"" is one of the sillier songs the band has ever done. ""Electrolite"" provides a strong closing to the album. While this album isn't the best they've ever done, it still contains strong work and is worth a listen."
5,One the best... the best,"As a relatively young R.E.M fan, this album stands out for me and I am sure it does for other younger fans... I love every single song! Prior to this, I had albums like 'Up' and ""Around the Sun,' which are different to this one. [And I want this album to be a 5-star, so i am taking the effort to raise the rating.]Worth the $10... ""Leave"" ""E Bow the Letter""... are at the top of my playlist."
5,Even better than the 1st one,"I liked the author's first ""Socrates book"" a lot, though it was a little heavy on the earnestness at times; I find this one much better, excellent in fact. Phillips has found his philosophical footing and his voice, with crisp and compelling dialogues, exceptional scholarship, and his own well-grounded and at times groundbreaking critiques and insights. This book, with its global scope and particular emphasis on nonWestern philosophical thinking, should find a much wider audience than his first."
1,"This is not socratic, nor discovery","The key concept is ""modern-day Journey"". The book is full of worn out polemics that dominate any modern attempt at discussion. If your interest is in any Socratic questions, do not waste your money on this book. If your interest is in exploring philosophical questions, you would be better off going to your neighborhood Starbucks and engaging discussion with anyone. It is a shame that Mr. Phillips has appropriated such a fine man's name for his own propoganda. Socrates wouldn't have given him a minute of his time."
5,Could be a good one.,I have not completely got through this book. From what I have read I think it is a good book.
3,Nice premise for a book,"Author Phillips travels around the world, asking people the same questions Socrates asked. Nice premise for a book. Somehow, I imagine the actual experiences of meeting with the groups were a lot more fun than what is presented in the book. Why is it sometimes you can't capture that zing in a book?"
4,Enlightening,"I had to read this book for a course at school. It was interesting, to say the least, and kept my attention throughout the book. I'm not usually one for philosophy books, yet I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good philosophy book to read."
2,"Works for storing light items, tools or any weight..FORGET IT!!","If you are getting this for storing and moving around tools, or any heavy components...think again. It can hold heavy objects as long as you have no intention of rolling it or moving it while they are inside. For myself it ended up being just an overpriced storage trunk with the added advantage of wheels(that were not strategically placed for anyone over 5'2"" to pull), and the place for a lock (keep in mind plastic used is NOT durable, so a metal padlock I'd imagine would break through the plastic with a couple good twists. One thing good about the soft plastic material is you can over-stuff it and it easily stretches to close evenly at the latches. Unless you can afford to burn the cash, go to the dollar store, they are coming out with wheels on their storage bins now and much better colors."
2,Cheaper at Walmart,"We purchased this item for my son to use for summer camp. Although it IS a sturdy footlocker, it didn't give us enough room to fit everything. After purchasing this footlocker we saw it for half the price at Lowe's and even cheaper at Walmart (not to mention what we paid in shipping). We were disappointed but I guess it pays to shop around. For the price we paid online I would recommend shopping around first."
2,Wal-Mart quality at twice the price,"If a large plastic storage tub doesn't quite fit the bill and you'd prefer something with a hinged lid and latches, then this might be what you're looking for. It isn't anymore durable that a Rubbermaid tub and, when full, isn't that easy to move around."
1,This is just one terrible football,"First of all, it isn't official size. An eight year old can grip this. I know its not pigskin, but it doesn't even resemble any time of feel of pigskin. It feels cheap. And to top it all off, I received a flat one! I pumped it to find out it had a hole in it. Got a refund luckily. Just go to the store and try some footballs out and spend a few extra bucks for a nice one."
1,I bought 1 of these item about 2 week ago and got charged on my credit card but I do not have anwers yet.,I would like to know about myy status oj these football ball I bought 2 week ago and I don`t have any anwers about it and how to contact the store.Wilson F1415 NFL MVP Football (Official Size)
5,The only review you'll need to read,The product is just as advertised. official nfl size football. the leather has a nice feel and grip to it the lines are stiched on with quality like the wilson brand offers. definately would purchase again great price as well. arrived in perfect condition the air was the perfect amount no squishing of the football. nice and tight feel that's expected
2,I hate this ball,"Bought this to replace a Wilson ""Tackified"" leather-ish ball that I bought around 10 yrs ago for about $35. My dog kinda ruined it recently. Thought this might be the same ball and I was getting a great deal. Wrong. The reviews were great, but this ball looks and feels super cheap and rubbery. It may be worth the price of $15 (that's the only reason I gave it more than 1 star), but imho it's not even worth playing catch with. The U of Michigan ball that I bought on Amazon for $15 to keep in my office is better quality. Considering the low price I'm not even gonna bother to pay shipping to return it. Think I'll gift it to a friend with a kid, and pay a bit more to get a real leather ball that I actually want to throw and catch with."
1,Poor construction,My football started tearing along one of the seams after only a week of daily use at 15 minutes per use. I did not pressurize the football after receiving from Amazon and now the ball is severely mis-shapen. I will have to return to Wilson under warranty.
3,not bad for the money,"I bought 3 of these f1415 Wilson's. I intended to use them as practice balls for my Ukraine amateur adult football team. Within the first week, one of the balls separated at the seam. These were used only for passing. Never kicked. Truth be known they are much lighter then a game ball and don't provide the correct feel for training. I retired all three and replaced them with real footballs.. These are toys... I didn't expect much for the price anyway. Now I toss them to the children who come to watch us train. They served their purpose in the end, provide fun ..."
3,busted,I was quite satisfied with Amazon's service and prompt followup when after only two days the bladder inside the ball burst out of one of the seams. I don't know if it was due to weak stitching or if the ball had been overinflated at the factory. I did notice the replacement ball was less inflated.
4,good ball - but not great for real play,i think this is a good ball for kids or to toss around. but the material isn't up to standard for other wilson balls I have. it appears to be more of a plastic rubber rather than a real composite material. I have another wilson ball that's tan colors and it's very grippy and tacky that we use for flag.
2,Football sucked,"Well kids love balls,opened it up christmas morning played with it all morning, then had a fall went to ER, grandson survived the football did not. I would of thought that it would of lasted rough & tumble play by a group of 7 year old kids, very disapointed next time I will buy a cheap plastic football instead, Now I have a sad little 7 yr old with a messed up arm and no football,"
2,fell apart fast.,"This ball didnt last 3 months. My teenager played foot ball with it and with his friends. The strings started coming out after about 4 games. After a while, it just completely fell apart. Very dissapointing."
1,No good,The worst thing about this football is the grip! This football is like trying to throw or catch a stick of butter when it gets wet or has some dirt on it. Don't make the mistake I made by purchasing this football. Invest a bit more money and buy a leather football. You get what you pay for and this football will not be fun to try to handle. Makes a great dog toy though. My Boxer can't even pick the ball up it is so slippery so he is entertained for a long time running after this thing around the yard trying to pick it up.
3,This is a gift,I bought this as a gift to donate to a toy drive. I hope the child who receives it enjoys it greatly.
2,I want to support the american economy for a bit,"I thought this was made in america, just a tricky blend of words can make a toyota or kawasaki sound like it's built in america, it would be nice if american companies would at least help americans support them instead of tricking them into sending funding that should be for our economy to other countries."
1,Bad shape of the Football Ball,"I bought a Wilson F1415 NFL MVP Football, and when I take off of the box, one of the side needlework was disrupted. I fact I think they put a lot of pressure in the ball. So, the sew was open."
1,This item was BAD!,The ball came deflated...so I put air in it only to find that on one side the stiching wasn't even completely made and their was a huge hole in the side of it! VERY POOR quality.. Guess I get what I paid for... opened this package and it went straight into the trash! GREAT JOB... NOT
1,Football,This football lasted about 30 minutes before it started losing air. There must have been in a hole in it when we received it because it kept deflating.
2,got damaged pretty early,"It lasted just 10 days !!!Even not playing with it, the ball suddenly, just became unpicked.Feel quite desappointed."
2,Low-end composite ball,"I purchased this ball because I was looking for an affordable replacement for my decade-old ""Duke"" leather ball; I just don't have the money for another one right now. In my experience, composite footballs come in two varieties: soft-to-the-touch and hard-to-the-touch. The ""hard"" composite leather feels more like the rubber used for cheap outdoor basketballs, and the ""soft"" variety feel much more like real leather.This football is the ""hard"" variety, and I can't say I would recommend it unless that happens to be what you are looking for. To it's credit, it is holding together well and came as described. It throws well, but is relatively difficult to catch because of the poor-quality composite it is made with.Having been spoiled by owning a leather ball for so long, I just couldn't stick with this one. I've already replaced it with one that I hope will be of the ""soft"" composite variety, and will likely end up donating this one to a local school or something."
5,Football,This football is fantastic for those of us with butterfingers. The grip is kind of rubbery which allows us to catch much better than our older football. There is a little seperation on the stiching starting to show. Not sure if it came from the factory that way or if we used it too hard. Other than that we love this thing.
1,Very poor quality,"After less than two hours of play, the football developed large bumps along the seams and with less than 4 hours of play, the seam began tearing out. The materials used in this ball are very low quality."
1,Arrived deflated,Bought this football to throw around the park and neighborhood. It arrived deflated - so I had to go to a sporting goods store to by the needle inflation adapter. After trying to inflate the ball it immediately lost all air - and apparently has a massive leak somewhere inside. So in short - I've never been able to use this.
5,A Nice Football for a Good Price.,"I bought this football as a gift for a 13 year old kid. I think it's a great football for the price. It's a good size, has good texture, and looks fantastic.I think it would be a great football for playing with in the yard. Overall I'm pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid pigskin at a low price."
5,Great chill cd yet even better uptempo mix,"Once again Bedrock brings yet another great mix for all to enjoy. This is vol.2 of the layered sounds mix comps. and in my honest opinion many steps above its vol.1. Cd1 is Bedrocks downbeat selections and I must say (though I am not too much into the chill or downbeat mixes) this cd has truly a great sound. It seems to me that most ""Chill"" cds seem to have a bit to many obsucure tracks that do not mix to well. I really like the flow and the track selection of cd1. A bit like the amazing Northern Exposer feel. Now on to the reason I bought this cd, CD2 ""upbeats"" has some amazing Prog. house tracks. A much better and DEEPER mix than vol.1 with lush sounds and some GREAT remixes. I have purchased almost every big label release at the moment (Renaissance, Global Underground, Balance, Tiesto's new ISOS)yet this mix(more so disc 2) seems to be getting played a bit more.Both cds are Great prog./chill mixes that should not be missed by both fans."
3,It's not THAT great.,"Bedrock has got to be overall one of my favorite labels, when they get cds right, theyre always amazing. Take Chris Fortiers' and Jimmy Van M's Bedrock cds for instance, they're both some of the best dark, deep, progressive house mixes out there, from beginning to end . But many times i have bought other Bedrock cds such as this one or Foundations and find them to be somewhat boring. They're so prog that they eventually just get boring and long and make me want to skip the cd forward. But they do have some really good moments in between. So yes, the cd does have some nice parts but there's lots of boringness in there also. Overall, i recommend the cd only if you are already familiar with Bedrock and really want it, not if this is your first time listening to other Bedrock cds."
5,Classic Rich Little...,"Rich Little has done it again. Fresh and classic combined way to use his talents. The fun part was trying to guess the characters in the songs. A pleasent fun way to spend an evening with friends, family or just by yourself. I gave this to my parents. They love it and play it for friends whenever possible."
3,"Hey, what's the next tune?","Rich Little is the most famous impressionist of all time. On this album, he performs Frank Sinatra songs in the voices of many celebrities (usually more than one celebrity per song). The female celebrity voices are done by Kathy Walker. The celebrities ""performing"" will usually relate to the song's subject matter. For instance, ""Witchcraft"" features horror actors Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price; and ""Young at Heart"" features several elderly actors. Not the greatest album ever recorded, but fairly amusing."
3,need better quality control,"The PDA is very impressive. It is only one half the thickness of my old IPAQ and about 2/3 in weight. The processor is also very fast. The SD slot works better than that in IPAQ. (The IPAQ will not detect the card if there are too many programs running or the card is inserted when the PDA is on.) However, I had to return mine because it was defective and it could not connect to ActiveSync. I belive it may be the one in a thousand but I was hoping the quality control of Toshiba would do better than that."
1,Toshiba just care Money not customer service,"I get it PDA for long time ago ,but the screen was broken after one month that I buy . I told Toshiba about it.but they told I need to pay them $ 150 and send them that PDA,then they will send me other old PDA.I was really upset on that time ,my PDA was sitting at my draw since that time.They was charge me too much , and the charge was not for fixing my PDA , MY PDA was just 1 month old at that time, but they just worry about the money, not the customer service.Since that time ,I was buy other two laptop from them , but If I can remember this case ,I will not buy anything from them"
4,Just like being there!,"The way that Barbara gives details of the trip through Africa made me feel like I was along for the ride!! The subject matter, although disturbing and true, made for a very suspensfulstory. I feel as though I know the main characters due to the indepth look at each one. I found myself not wanting to put itdown just to see what was around the next bend. A really good novel for a first effort. My hat is off to you, Ms. Davis!!"
5,Stellar Book on Dance!,"Never before have I encountered a book with such rich content dealing with the dance field and---photos no less, that truly capture these interesting and provocative dance artists. Not only did the book peak my interest about the field, it inspired me to consider going to the theater for a evening of dance--something I haven't done in years.I recommend this book to dancers, educators and average people who simply want to be inspired.Jack Caffrey"
1,DVD Doctor,"This product is, in a word, terrible. I cannot believe that this contraption has ever improved the readability of any CD or DVD. Rather, it riddles your discs with a barrage of scratches, making the information absolutely indecipherable by all CD and DVD players. The instruction guide even suggests ""buffing"" the disc with a felt pad afterward--no doubt to ensure that the entire surface is scratch-filled. I would advise against purchasing or borrowing this product, as it is much cheaper and easier to destroy CDs/DVDs with steel wool or a small hammer."
1,A Victim Of the DVD Doctor,This was the worst thiry bucks I have ever spent. I will have to use the Cds that I tried to fix as dog toys. People have said this is a great product but I think they had a piece of lint on there cd. In my case I had a severe scratch on a disc and used the DVD DR repeatedly for hours and used the correct instructions. Others say that I am doing it wrong. The product does not state clearly what kind of a scratch it takes care of. How are you supposed to judge how deep a scratch is before buying this product. I WOULD RECOMMEND AN AXE GRINDER TO REPAIR YOUR CDS INSTEAD OF DVD DOCTOR.
1,A waste of money,This was a waste of my money and time. This piece of plastic made our CDs and DVDs worse. Save your time and money. Don't buy this thing. You'd be better off throwing the disc away or just use some course sandpaper.
1,CD Destroyer!,"I bought this item hoping to restore some of my treasured older CDs - after very carefully reading the instructions, I tried it on one of my less-favored CDs (just in case). After ONE gentle round, my CD was scarred beyong recognition!? Thinking it was my fault, I re-read hte instructions & tried again with another CD - same results. This product is a hazard to CDs!"
3,It works,"This is an odd product. Essentially, what it does is wet sands your DVD's, CD's, etc.. It takes a lot of arm power, but in the end, it will wet sand out any scratches or nicks in your disc. If your disc has a minor scratch it will take care of the problem. If it's a major scratch you might find yourself going through the process a few times to wear it down enough to get it work. The tricky part is that you have to follow the directions precisely for it to work. Not a hard thing, really, but if you don't, you can end up obscuring the disc so the laser is unable to read it. I would guess the reviewer who said it didn't work didn't follow the directions correctly. For a few bucks, it's worth it."
4,Historical Biography,"Bright with Silver describes the rise of the United States ginseng and fox farming industries through the story of the Fromm brothers of Hamburg, Wisconsin. The Fromms began their lives at the turn of the century as impoverished farmers and rapidly grew into the world's largest ginseng and fox farmers, making tremendous discoveries along the way, including the canine distemper vaccine. The book chronicles their business successes through the 1950s."
2,Good at first then TOTAL FAILURE!!!!!!,Four years ago I recieved this product for Christmas and I loved the product. Reaching speeds up to 10 mph to me it is consided very slow. As Razor recommends this products to people 12 or older it probly would eceed slightly over 5mph or even slower. When I owned the E200S for a year and a half it suddendly didn't work. After 2 years sitting in my garage I found a product recall from the CPSC that involved my scooter model stating that the handle bars can break off and cause injury and it's battery carger could overheat. If this happens contact Razor for a free repair and a new battery charger. With 2003 to 2005 models these problems are the most evendent.
2,A huge disappointment & rotten customer service!,"I bought this scooter for my son's birthday. I saw what other reviews said about the battery, but figured that Razor would have corrected the problem by now. No such luck! After charging the battery as instructed, we ran the scooter until the battery died (about 3 minutes!), and then charged it again for about 12 hours. It has still not worked more than 3 minutes at a time. I contacted Razor, and a bored customer service rep told me to fax a copy of the receipt & they would send a new battery. I did so, & 10 days later I am still waiting. They have not responded at all! Even though the scooter is great fun (for 3 minutes), don't waste your time & money!"
2,Not what we hoped for...,"Purchased 2 as Christmas gifts for 12 yr old and 8 yr old. My 12 yr old hasn't been able to ride even around the block without the motor going into overload and shutting off. We click the override switch but it dies again in just a few feet. We assume that it is weight limit - but she is WELL under the 220 lb limit. Batteries were charged according to direction and it happens to her on either scooter... The 8 yr old can zip all over the place. Not much fun when only one sister can ride the scooter without it dying. My advice - if you are getting a scooter for anyone over 130 lbs then go with a bigger motor. This is too wimpy for anyone 150 lbs or more. (understand - my 12 yr old daughter is 5'7"", so we will have to consider buying it like an adult size) Sadly having to return this one and repurchase one with a larger motor."
5,Two thumbs up!!!,"I purchased this scooter for my daughters 9th birthday and she loves it! I have even had a go myself but I don't get to stay on it for to long as she wants it back. She rides her 10yr old sister on the back of it and it still flys!! We haven't tried it with the seat attached yet as I wanted her to get used to the speed first. It has been so much of a hit that I am buying another one for my 10yr for Christmas. In my daughters words ""It's the best present ever"""
3,scooter review,"This is the second year we have bought several scooters, this year the ones with seats. The kids love them but with two have had multiple problems keeping the chain on. A bit frustrating for the price involved. Mom In California"
3,Chain keeps slipping after a year,My 9 year old has had this for almost a year now and he loves it. But...there is a very low ground clearance and the street scrapes up the motor. Also I don't know if after a year of use it is the tension or the chain has stretched but the chain keeps falling off. It has been well loved this year though!!
5,Great Scooter,"We bought two of these for our girls for Christmas 2010 and they have been two of our best buys ever! They ride them everywhere, grass, gravel, pavement, hills, etc and we couldn't be more pleased. We took them camping last fall and before we knew it there was a line of kids waiting to try them out at the campground! There were four adults next to us who wanted to know if there were adult models too. If one of them quits I would not hesitate to buy a replacement."
3,Not new condition,The scooter looks good and it is a nice upgrade for my daughter from the Razor E175. But when it arrived it looked like it had possibly been a floor display model. The paint is scratched in several places and one place has a deep gouge in the area where you stand. One of the handlebar rubber end pieces is worn like it was rubbed against some concrete. None of these items would cause me to return it but she already wants to know if we can use some touchup paint on it.We are still on the first charge of the batteries and so she has yet to ride it. The seat is a little high for her and so for now we will use it without it.5 stars for the design. 2 stars for the vendor.
4,Good bang 4 the buck,"This model was $25.00 cheaper than the blue one( I know ,I'm so technical). It goes just as fast. I love the sound it makes when it is running."
1,These suck!,bought these for my 11 and 12 year olds. They are very slow and barely hold a charge. The kids road them a half dozen times and they have been in the garage ever since. Don't waste your $$$.
3,Razor E200 Scooter Throttle defect,"My son had his scooter for about 6 weeks when the throttle began malfunctioning. We called Razor USA to order a replacement. They acknowledged that there was a defect that caused the throttle to be 'always on'. They had a new-and-improved throttle to replace it. That was 9/13/04. It is now 4 weeks later and we have yet to receive the new throttle. They report the item is still on backorder and have no idea when it will be available.10/28/04 Update - Just one week after posting this review, the company contacted us and they are now going to replace the scooter. They say the new scooter has the improved throttle. We have to send them the control module from ours first, but it seems we are finally going to have some satisfaction from this."
4,Great Little Scooter,"I bought this for my grandson's birthday (11 years old) and it arrived in good shape and, after charging the battery, worked great right away. The charged battery seemed to last for a long time (about as long as his attention span) and he has gotten many hours of enjoyment. He said it was the best present he has ever received!The only minor issue was the plastic chain guard - it was so low that it scraped the ground if he leaned the scooter over hard in a turn. It finally broke away and seemed to be largely unnecessary to start with. Also, it did not come with the air valve extension needed to pump up the rear tire - at least if there was one I didn't find it. I haven't needed one yet but believe it would be readily available at an auto parts store."
2,Scooter review,"This item was listed as new (unused). When we received the scooter it had scratches and dents on the frame. Appeared to have been painted over to hide scratches. I believe this item was not new (the battery was already charged), would not have been the case if the battery was new."
3,Scooter woes,"We purchased this scooter for one of my daughters for Christmas. It did come in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the box was torn up, the frame where you stand had a small bend in the metal and then, the battery did not hold a charge. We purchased a similar scooter last year and have had no problems at all (also a Razor). Thinking we just got a dud this time. Upon calling Razor, they sent us a free battery. No directions to install it though!!! Ended up taking a bit to do it. Hoping today after it charged fully that the scooter will finally work!"
5,purely evil shxt,"This album is just straight up evil, but fresh. Natas is definitely the best rap groups out there. This album, just like all other Natas albums are all better than anything out there today. Their style is original, and nothing can top it, except themselves. Tracks 7 and 8 are the best songs on there. If you are a fan of rap, this one is a must have, but if you're afraid of the wickit shxt, then just back away from it and go cry to your mainstream wanna-be rappers."
5,Jezebel-- awesome,"I so enjoyed ""Jezebel"".. I couldn't put it down.. Made me look at my dogs with new eyes.. the answer to the question was -- it could happen.. Looking forward to another -- maybe come true.. Keep up the great work!"
3,Bad editing/proofreading spoiled a good book..pity,This was a good story which makes one look at one's dogs a little differently but formatting problems made it almost unreadable. It's a pity that the author put all the work into writing the book and then allowed it out without checking it.
4,"Review of ""A Dictionary of Epidemiology"" 4th edition","A useful reference by John Last, which, I believe, will be his last edition. Beginning researchers, especially non-epidemiologists such as clinicians, will find that many of the statistical and epidemiologic terms which they encounter in the medical literature are defined here in one compact reference."
5,wonderful resource,I am a doctoral student in epidemiolgy and have been working in the field of public health for the past ten years. This book is highly recommended. It is particularly useful for MDs and other professionals who need quick and easily understandable explainations of epidemilogical terms.
3,basic,useful book is simple and easy to use. for basic use but not for advance applications of epidemiology. is not a book that makes a deep revicion of epidemiological terms but rather the most common and widely used in basic areas of epidemiology
5,Fantatistic,"This is better than the studio LP as if that was possible.The extra items included on CD 2 Signed Dc just fantastic.LEE where have you been, as far as the music, and not Cal.You are the greatest I have followed you through the years De Capo to you!"
4,Did you know?,Arthur Lee returned to the concert scene after 6 years of imprisonment. I didn't know that.Excellent footage and sound.
4,A Must for Love Fans!,"Arthur Lee's vocals aren't always as good as the old days here, but they aren't as bad as you might think either. The band (Baby Lemonade) is more talented than the original Love, breathing some life into average performances of the past. All-in-all, an above-average effort. Not a must have, unless you are a true fan."
5,Chillingly Good,"I just bought this today. I bought the original FC lp in the mid '80s and loved it. Listening to the live recording literally gave me goosebumps. My god, what a talent. With a brain this fork-bendingly creative, it's almost no wonder Mr. Lee has led a checkered life. Someone excessively picky might complain that the live versions are too true to the originals, but I think that what makes this album so special.If you do not truly love, love, LOVE, good music, stay away from this one. You won't get it."
5,Live in a very positive way,"I bought this CD, thinking it was a re-release of Forever Changes, and that it would be nice to have at work. I was initially disappointed, returning to the office, to realize that it is a live concert version of Forever Changes. But - after listening to it - I am absolutley amazed - one of the best recorded concerts I have ever heard. The music is, in many places, actually better than the original recordings, in my opinion. The recording is excellent. There is something precious about a well-recorded live concert - but usually that precious essence is lost in a variety of shortcomings. In this case - it's pure Forever Changes. It's also great that, after so many years, Arthur Lee has overcome so many problems to absolute shine again. Shoot - maybe growing older isn't so bad after all. A chance mistaken purchase has ended up being a treasure."
2,Head comfortac,"The grip is OK, but wouldn't recommend it. Once your hand gets sweaty, it is very hard to keep a grip on handle without it slipping in your hand. If your hand isn't sweaty...it's a great grip."
3,Meh...,"I ordered this gun to use with glue-gun style sealing wax for wedding invitations. I wasn't really impressed that this didn't handle the thinner wax sticks like standard glue guns and I actually had to use a pen to push the wax out because the trigger on the gun didn't work. I do like that the cord is long, it comes with a convenient stand, and has a high/low heat option."
3,Still drips,"Although the product details claim the tip does not drip - it still does - once the glue that has dripped down has dried it's easy to pull it off - but still, I was expecting it to be drip free.Also, the stand it comes with is not at all sturdy - you have to be very careful when placing the glue gun on the stand because it is very wobbly. I think I may just lay it down as oppose to using the stand it comes with."
2,does too drip,"I like the dual temp, it heats up quicker than my last one, but mainly I bought it for the no drip tip. This thing dripps like CRAZY. I have WAY more glue on the stand than on my project. The small silicone pad on the stand is completely insufficient for the drip. I tried to lay in on it's side like they say and just got a big puddle of glue on the side of the gun.Not Happy! I may just go back to my old gun to save glue."
4,happy with purchase,"While not perfect, this is the best glue gun I've ever used. Very easy to use with one hand. Would recommend to crafters."
4,"One excellent, the other junk","I bought two at the same time. I'm still using one to this day. I'm a heavy user, low temperature only, it being on 8 hours a day, most days for at least 2 years. The second exact glue gun was used about 7 times and completely died. Go figure. Yes, they do leak some, that is the nature of glue guns. I'm conflicted about buying this glue gun again. It's a 50-50 chance."
4,Good gun.,"I have used numerous glue guns and this is one of the best so far. I like the idea of it being a dual temp with a selector. I use it mainly on high for gluing plastic and foam core together to hold thick liquid for some crafting that I do. The gun does drip, but nothing horrible. Being a full size glue gun has the benefits of the hand trigger and not a little finger trigger like some of the smaller guns. My hand does get a bit fatigued from the trigger, but I think that is me and not the guns fault.Great purchase!"
4,"good, but harder to find glue","This product works very well, once you are able to find a place that sells the glue sticks. It has a good handle and feels sturdy. The stand comes with a pad that makes drips easy to clean up. The built in ""kick stand"" is very unsteady and will tip over easily. make sure to use the separate stand.There is no on/off button.it heats up within 3 minutes and is ready to use."
3,"nice glue gun, but...","Despite it's claim that it has a no-drip tip; I'm here to tell you that this sucker drips. As long as a glue stick is in the chamber and the unit is on, it will drip and continue to do so until turned off and allowed to cool. Other than the aforementioned, I like it's duel temp feature and low price. Does not come with any glue sticks :("
1,cannot get it to work,I received this item as a gift and exchanged the first one because I could not seem to get it to make the glue come out. I put in several sticks of glue but nothing came out. I figured perhaps it was a fluke. Now I finally got around to trying the second one I received and the same thing. The glue will not come out. I cannot imagine I am supposed to put in 10 glue sticks to get this to work. Unfortunately its too late to return it yet again. I should have just returned it in the first place but noone seemed to be having this issue so I figured it was a fluke. Guess not. Dont buy.
1,Does not work.,2 glue sticks put into gun and melted......nothing came out. The glue is likely pooling inside gun as other reviews said. I am sad purchaser.
1,Blew out my fuses,This worked for about five minutes and then blew out my electrical outlet. It's dangerous. Sent it right back.
3,I can't tell,"This is my first glue gun so I'm not an expert, but I've seen similar-looking products in the craft store for less with some glue sticks included. It serves it's purpose though."
2,A Month and still hasn't shipped!!!!,I ordered this glue gun as a Christmas Gift for my sister-in-law on Dec. 2nd and as of Jan. 2nd it is still not shipped ad has not shipping estimated date!!! This is a horrible way to do business; and if it is not shipped within the next week I will be cancelling. If you are selling items under the super saver shipping and it guarantees you will get it by Christmas then it SHOULD BE THERE BY CHRISTMAS!!!!
1,Lead warning,"The back of the package indicates that the power cord on this product contains lead, and the user should wash their hands after operating the unit. While it is possible that it might be mis-worded and the lead is on the inside, it wasn't worth the risk for me to keep it. What's more, there's no reason for most consumer-grade products to contain any lead anymore, even on the inside. Check out ROHS for more information if you're curious about where lead is allowed in consumer products."
2,Be Warned! The miking is too far away from singers,"It is impossible for me to enjoy this DVD. The singers are simply too far from the microphones. Consequently their voices are echo-y and the words almost impossible to understand even you speak French. Why are some products released like this? I realize Kultur is a small company, but there must be some quality control at some level. Most of their opera DVDs are well recorded; but this is disgraceful. Perhaps my copy is defective, but that is highly unlikely."
1,Most Horrible Textbook Ever,"I used this book in my sophomore year Intro to EE class and it has to be the most horribly written technical textbook ever. I read from the book only once the whole semester and spent the rest of the time learning from tutors and lecture notes. The examples are cryptic and poorly explained and the chapters are haphazardly organized. I pity those who're forced to buy this for their EE classes, but if you have a choice, you can definitely find yourself a much better textbook than this piece of junk."
5,Excellent introductory text.,"This is a very nice introduction to Electrical Engineering, which includes such topics as semiconductor devices, electromechanic machines or circuit theory.Before reading this book you should be familiar with calculus and complex numbers.The authors have concentrated on the most interesting topics and have developed them in a direct, revealing way, providing motivation before introducing each new concept. The chapters on steady state response and complex numbers are great.A light, well written book."
1,"This is certainly not ""An Introduction""","If you are a novice EE student, never buy this book. This is not an introduction in the sense we usually think. In a word, terrible!"
5,Two for the price of one,"Included in this book are TWO superb stories following the ongoing story of Deep Space Nine, as begun in the television series and as continued in a very good run of books, most recently (prior to this book) in ""Unity"". Each of these stories is about 200 pages, but neither of them seemed particularly short; I was surprised when I checked that they weren't each full-novel length. The first follows events on Cardassia in the aftermath of the Dominion war, the second follows the characters of Shar and Prynn on a trip to Andor. Both are extremely well-written and would have been worth the price of a full novel on their own."
2,"3 stars for Cardassia, 1 star for Andor","Una McCormack's Cardassia story is a solid effort, with a welcome back into the fold (sort of) of the O'Brien clan. The politics of Keiko's project on Cardassia are interesting to watch, and it's always great fun to see Garak and Gul Macet. I liked the writing and found the story engaging and tense. 3 starsHeather Jarman's Andor story, though, was written with the romantic sensibilities of a 16 year old girl and the political sensibilities of a high school class president. The story is dull and the writing is confused, with ridiculous onomatopoeia, over-the-top writing, and wandering points of view. If not for the continuing DS9 story, I would have skipped this one after about 20 pages. 1 star"
1,I was disappointed,I found it difficult to even finish this work. I think Ms. McCormack has potential but her writing resembles that done for college level creative writing courses. Overly descriptive with a sophomoric 'breathy' quality. Characterizations tended to thin out. I'll wait and borrow her next one from a friend rather than purchase it myself. I had high hopes after reading Ms. Jarmen's work.
1,Save Your Money!,"This book is so dull and boring it isn't even funny. If I were you I would save my hard-earned money and not get this book.It's kind of sad, really. The DS9 relaunch had been so good, right up to the uber-cool Unity. And now this. Such a disappointment."
3,Socks,"I have always loved the quality of the ""GoldToe"" socks. However this time I was disappointed. The socks are VERY thin....and are not holding up very well. They have been worn twice and are already having little nubby fuzz balls on them....."
5,Plush Dolphin,"This dolphin was purchased for my dolphin lover, she was so surprised at Christmas, she says it is soft, cuddly, and she sleeps with it all the time! It is about as big as a pillow, and you could even use it for that! It arrived within 2 days, I was extremely happy with this purchase and the company."
4,Architects of Air Power (Epic of Flight),General Billy Mitchell and Reich Marshal Hermann Goring are among the aviators discussed in a study of the growth of air power in the years between World War I and World War II.
2,Eegh,Too much 'conversation' to read in this story. Really like the imagination of the boy- but its lost to the conversational style of the writing. Will probably donate to a library.
5,Perfect,"After reading the the other review, I was prepared to be disapointed in my bag. However, I think it is the perfect size. Everything fits snug and I have room for two or three dvd's w/cases. There is no waisted space and I find it to be extremely compact. The only way to make it smaller would be to elimate the room to carry dvds. Anyone who has a portable dvd should have a case to keep it protected."
3,Not quite the size for the LC10,"The case is designed to hold DVD players in a 'vertual' type faction. Cause of this, there is very, very little room to change size using the velcro strap. I have a Pioneer LC10 and it's just a bit too long to fit snugly into this case. I'm foreced to stretch the corner of the case out a bit just to make room.This appears to be a fine and dandy case for the smaller DVD players, but not for the LC10.Another minus to this is the lack of room for other items. I'm unable to carry my external battery back in this case, and barly fit my extra cords and cables, but no room for headphones. I would much rather had something along the lines of a small backpack for this to carry my DVD player around with."
5,case logic portable dvd case,"I WAS PLESANTLY SURPRISED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS ITEM WHILE I EXPECTED IT TO BE ADAQUATE FOR THE PRICE, I FOUND IT TO BE SO MUCH BETTER. THE CASE IS SOFT AND SUPPLE THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM TO STORE YOUR DVD PLAYER AND ALL ACESSORIES AND THE CASE IS REAL EASY TO CARRY. THE PRICE ALONE MAKES IT THE BEST BUY.YOU WON'T BE SORRY IF YOU BUY IT"
2,Bag too small,"The bag is too small. Sure it hold the DVD player and has two side pockets, but it can't hold a typical portable DVD player inventory. With my 7"" Audiovox came, 6' power cord, an A/C to D/C converter, an auto power cord, an adapter for the battery pack, S-Video link for a TV, RCA plugs link for older TVs, remote control, and earplug type headphones. I added a better pair of small walkman like headphones. That packed the bag tight. No room for DVDs in their cases. My suggestion is get a small padded Laptop bag. OH YEAH, one other thing, the bag looks like a black leather pocket book."
2,Rip-off,"Three mediocre new stories, but I felt ripped-off by buying a book containing lots of stuff of hers that I'd already paid good money to read. She should have just saved the three new books for her next collection."
5,Awesome book,i read where some people were not happy with this book but i found it interesting this is my first book i have bought by Ann Rule she is a great author i enjoyed reading about the cases she has wittiness and studied i can't wait to get another book by her
3,Good but not great,"The cover explained that some of the stories were repeats from previous books, but it wasn't too bad going back and reading them again. Plus the new stories were good. Now looking forward to reading her latest book. Will always be an Ann Rule fan.."
1,A Poor Excuse for a Book,"I have just finished this book and doubt I will ever buy another Ann Rule book. Iused to enjoy her books, but with this one I believe she was just out to make more and more money. Anyone who reads her books has already read these stories......not in this condensed version. I think authors who are only out there to make $$$$ should give it up. I am certain Ms Rule has made Millions and does not need to write book reviews of books which have already been published and sold.Ann........you should be ashamed of yourself. This is duping the public and I find it disgusting. You have lost an avid customer of yours."
1,mysteries,I find that I don't like the Ann Rule books. I started this one but chose not to finish it.
2,I agree!,"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this book! I am an avid Ann Rule fan - it's hard for me to find a book of hers that I don't already own. When I saw this one (at Target, no less) I was suprised and bought it right away. What a disappointment! I already owned 90% of it in other publications, and really felt that I had been scammed into buying something. I rated this with 2 stars, because as always, Ann's writing is superb, and if you aren't an avid follower, this book would be great for you. But if you've already read most of her work, don't get suckered into buying this."
1,DULL,"Obviously, you are not allowed to give an honest review if it is against Ms. Rule. I reviewed this book awhile back, and now I see it has been deleted. That's pretty sad since I buy my books from Amazon. When I bought the book, I didn't realize that it was about stories that were previously written. While there were three new stories, the stories are over 30 years old. I'm a fan of Ann's, I just wish we weren't sold short on this one. I know this will be deleted again...but I will state my review again: the book is dull, and a repeat of stories previously written."
4,Read Those Reviews!,"""Without Pity"" comes not without controversy. This selection of ""old"" Ann stories apparently covers crimes from seven previous volumes. This reviewer was free of worry because he has always concentrated on Ann's full length efforts and had not read any compilations. For the record, the back cover does refer to WP as an update of astonishing cases. (Back covers are not available for on line inspection). That stated, WP still represents first rate true crime. No plot synopses are listed here but all the stories are good, gritty and set reliably in the Pacific Northwest. The best is ""Dead and On Tape"" in which a cop is recorded committing a murder! ""Without Pity"" is an excellent example of the utility of reading amazon reviews before purchase. Those new to Ann may plunge in free of the swirl surrounding WP. As always, new readers may always proceed to early full length Ann choices like ""The I-5 Killer"", ""The Want Ad Killer"", ""Lust Killer"" and ""The Stranger Beside Me"""
4,"Something old, something new","I really, really love Ann Rule. ""Without Pity"" is a collection of 12 short cases, three new, the rest reruns from her earlier books. I personally like her long books that contain one story, such as ""Small Sacrifices"", or the True Crime Files volumes which contain one book-length story supplemented by a few shorter stories, such as ""Last Dance, Last Chance"". But if you have read her longer works, and can't get enough of Ann Rule, the three new stories in this book alone will be worth the price of admission. If you have not read Ann Rule's earlier books, the older stories are all very interesting ones too."
3,good for the old school,"Mary Daheim's ""Creeps Suzette"" isn't bad, but I find it irritating that she seems to find it necessary to mock those who are in favor of animal rights. I find the frequent religious references and moralizing a bit much, as well. But all in all it's not a bad story. I appreciate her showing a family tree; it helped to keep the characters straight."
3,Good mystery with a questionable title,"Judith and Renie find themselves in the midst of another murder after being summoned by wealthy Leota Burgess to find out who has been making attempts on her life. It is up to the cousins to explore the estate known as The Creepers and to question the Burgess family members to find out who may want to get rid of old Leota. The plot is interesting and the interaction between the characters is engaging and credible. The only problem I have is with the title. It doesn't make much sense given the situation in the story. Yes, there is a Suzette, a marginal character. I suppose ""Creeps"" is referring to the estate. The title is just too cutesy for the quality of writing in the book. The author has a strong enough reputation that she shouldn't have to come up with silly titles."
5,what a incredible albumn,"well, what can i say? I was kinda complacent about buying this albumn. i was actually only going to gat the single of ""cigarettes will kill you"" after hearing it on the radio. but i could only find the albumn and got that. I will say this, it is the finest albumn that i have ever heard and probaly ever will. I'm impressed with Ben Lee's song writing in particular, especially seeing he's only 20. this albumn is unique in that every song is different, it feels different and sounds different. give him 2 weeks and he could come up with a better albumn than someone older than him could in 2 years, it's that good. all songs on the albumn are excellent. ""cigarettes will kill u"" ,"" tornados"" and ""nothing much happens are my favourite. beleive you me, you won't regret buying this albumn."
5,"THIS IS BEN'S ""DANCIER-DRUMMACHINE-THING"" & STILL BEN.","THIS CD LIKE THE ONE'S BEFORE IT REFLECT A BOY SLOWLY TURNING INTO A MAN. A PERCEPTIVE MAN. IT GOES FROM A GROOVE TO A TOE TAP TO A MELODY STAYING NOT TO FAR FROM THE TRACK. ""MR LEE WHAT A FINE MUSICIAN YOU HAVE GROWN TO BECOME."" I DO LIKE THE VERSION OF BURN TO SHINE ON BEST MEN BEST THOUGH.IT IS MORE HEART FELT. IS THAT AVAILABLE?"
4,a lot goes on but nothing happens...,Truly a great album by a brilliant artist. He does sing the line '...a lot goes on but nothing happens..' and that is slightly true for this album. The songs are done perfectly...but I still feel his best is yet to come - none the less buy it!
2,"sorry, but i was disappointed","Last year, i bought my first Ben Lee cd. It was Grandpaw Would. It is one of my favorites. Recently i decided to buy another Ben Lee album. I couldn't find Something to Remember Me By, so i bought Breathing Tornadoes.What Happened? Grandpaw Would was filled with simple happy pop songs that would stick in your head for days. Breathing Tornadoes sounds like Ben Lee trying hard to be older, and he gives me something that might be enjoyed more by my parents. The only songs worth more than one listen are Cigarettes Can Kill You, Nothing Much Happens, Feeling Tornadoes and Ship My Body Home, and those aren't that good. Time to go back to those stories that were fun when you were 4, Ben. Maybe then you'll sound good again."
5,BEN LEE IS GOOD,"i had the pleasure of seeing him live, when he opened for J Mascis, and he was amazing. ""Burn To Shine"" was soooo passionate.. buy this"
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping this book would be as helpful as a series of home improvement books that Time Life put out in the 80's. It wasn't. In fact, when cleaning out her house my mom gave me an old home improvement book from the 1960's. That one was far, far better than this one. I would recommend skipping this book and getting something else. Anything else."
5,Come On Back is more than welcome,"Just received my copy of 'Come On Back', and it's by far Jimmie Dale Gilmore's best work I've heard. 'Peace In the Valley' is very moving. The entire cd is fantastic. Many thanks, Jimmie."
4,"4 and 1/2 stars,","i had a dream last night. i dreamed that i lived in a world where toby keith, vince gill and garth brooks were anonymous individuals, perhaps working in construction, and that the most lauded and famous country music stars were fellas named ""billy joe shaver,"" ""buddy miller,"" and ""jimmie dale gilmore."" what a great dream. and when i awoke i was sad, because i remembered how the world really was. i just wanted to go back to sleep and dream some more."
4,Not a Canon lense...,"This lense does as advertised, but it does not compare with the Canon lenses in how the mechanism moves or in optics. I use it for basic snapshot type stuff, but I use my Canon lenses for the photos that count. I would call this a good value for your money lense, but not the best."
4,another fun addition to the spiderman collection,"OK...I will get right to the point. Spectacular Spiderman 7 is good. The pro's to this volume would be that it continues with the story of Peter Parker and introduces some new villians (Silver Sable, Silvermain) as well as continues the story of some old villians (Doc Oct, Tombstone, and Hammerhead). I love the stories and this cartoon has become my son's favorite. The Con's- only 3 episodes on this disc (much like volume 6), I paid $16 dollars for it on Amazon and Walmart has it for $10 dollars new, and last, the story line in 7 is a little weaker than the other volumes. I am not sure if season two had another volume (8) but at the end of 7, it leaves you hanging- wanting more. So lets hope there are more to come....I know a lot of people hate the volumes and wish they would just make the complete season- personally, I hate waiting that long- so sorry for encouraging them to continue in this practice"
2,I give the HP a1230n one-half notch above mediocre...,"I bought the a1230n for about 875.00 (not incl. monitor) in Sept '05. I give it a hlaf notch above mediocre. Solid cabinet, separare DVD/CD drive bays, handy audio jacks in the front, 4 USB jacks. MD processor is suppose to be better for multi-media.. hmmm. Replaced the chinsey keyboard/mouse included in the package. I grew up in HP territory, the once thriving giant HP comlex is now a ghost town. Almost all design/assebly is outsourced now, this unit assembled in China. Whould I buy it again knowing what I know now ... naah."
3,"good price, graphics weak, PSU weak, box too small","The computer is nicely built. The onboard graphics isweak, it chokes on COD2. Windows Media Center is problematic,gone through 2 system restores in 2 weeks, both IE related.Help desk is OK if you get the right person, some of themaren't helpful at all.Update Aug. 2007: bothDVD and CD drives failed. Be careful with HP optical drives, especiallythe DVD writer, I have 3 HP writers, 2 needed replacement, 1 dead out of warranty. The case is too crammed, frontpanel plastic very cheap."
2,DVD crashes after a month,"The DVD-CD writer stopped working after few burns,support has been good so far, they promissed to exchange the defective drive.Navigation on the desktop is slow,might be caused by the shared video memory, I had the same issue in an older Pavillion."
2,problems,"I have had many problems with my Hp. Within two months I needed a new hard drive. It has ""crashed"" several times. I regret this purchase."
1,The worst PC ever seen,"I bought the HP a1230n a month ago.I have to say that is the worst PC I ever used. It creat huge noise from the motherboard, not the harddrive. I disconneted the power cable of the harddrive, the noise was still there. HP's service is even worse. I sent my computer in twice and they sent me back without fixing the problem and the report said no problem found. What they did was running test, I think. No wonder, the diagnose software can't hear the noise!! I will never buy HP computer!"
2,Good luck,"Follow the instructions in this book and try and change the back spark plugs. Good luck. It leaves out a few steps, but it's better than nothing.You might want to jack up the van and go at them from underneath. Either way, it's a tough job to get at them."
3,Not bad for a starter,"The dealer said my wheel bearings and tie rod ends were ""going"" and I needed new ones. The estimate was well over $800. I bought the book & read what I had to do. I am already fairly mechanically inclined so I understood the somewhat simple (disassembly) instructions.Long story short - I changed the wheel bearings, front brake pads & rotors for a total of $300 in 1 afternoon on the weekend."
3,Book review on the 1999 Montana van,"When you consider the technological advancements the world has made over the last 20yrs. , color pictures should be included even if the cost goes up. At least my it optional. This would make the manual extremely user friendly."
1,Hunting for Disappointment!,"I had high expectations with this game as it touted the many missions, quests, and adventures you will embark on throughout the game. However, as you soon find out, the game is monotonous. Apart from sailing port to port and engaging pirates there is, honestly, nothing else you do in the game. And, the engagements/attacks against pirates are boring themselves. All you do is try to out maneuver the pirates and blast away at them. (not hard, and after a few engagements, not fun anymore!) There is no swashbuckling, there is no interaction with your crew, there are no dangers from sailing in general. The game needs no manual because there is nothing creative you can do in the game. This game should have just been available as a free download because of its lack of complexity or creativity. The game is a huge disappointment, with no creativity in design, and a waste of money."
4,Not Pirates!,"I had the original Pirates on my commodore 64 computer. Gave me hours of fun. I found this one for the windows platform, and it is great. I only play it every 3 or 4 months, because if I get started, I will play it daily for at least 2 or 3 weeks. I have had this game for years. Still love to crank it up every so often. It is great for trips when you have a couple of hours to kill. I believe the price is a little high, but this game is really good if you like sailing the seas and being a pirate!"
4,Beginners and Intermediate players can enjoy this also,Don't believe those reviews that describe this book as suitable for advanced players only. I could enjoy this book without a board and pieces. The prose is somewhat limited.All players deserve to be encouraged to look at his games.
5,A good meaty story,"I love Gay Courter's books. Her stories are well-researched with plenty of interesting details to support the plot, and her character development is top notch. These are not quick reads, as are many novels these days; but neither are they slow or cumbersome tales. ""The Midwife"" moves right along (as did her others), and my attention was held right up to the end. She weaves an intricate plot, which led me to feel I was really experiencing the full measure of these people's lives. Keep it up, Gay!"
5,The Midwife,"The Midwife by Gay Courter = Could not put the book down - found it very interesting, touching, and a good read!"
2,the midwife,the midwife was very disappointing. I have friends from England who watched the show on PBS. The book was repititous and sophomoric. It could have all been done in an essay.
2,Tells to much about consepion! Writing for 2.,"I loved this book, BUT! I read this when I had just turned 15. [I am almost 17 now] I am think of becoming a midwife or work in labor or delivery. This book for a new 15 year old was a WIDE EYE OPENER! I did not know how babys came about. but I was so ""into"" the book rooting for her that I could not put the book down! I got in trouble when Mom found out [after I read the book I told her] And I could not look at her in the eye for a week! To revealing and It did not have many birthing seens and that is why I got the book! I gave it a 2 star just for how good a writer she is!"
4,The midwife,"This was an excellent book. The historical aspect of the book was fascinating. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more birthing side stories, as that is a particular interest of mine. Overall a great read, can't wait to start the next in the saga."
5,I loved it!,"My friend told me that this book was really good, so I bought it at a used book sale for a buck. It took me over a year to open the book, but once I started reading, I was hooked. I loved Hannah's story. I really enjoyed reading about the history of the struggles of midwives in this country. Unfortunately, not much has changed in that regard. The medical establishment is still threatened by midwives and their espousal of natural birth and a woman's right to birth the way that she chooses, without unnecessary medical interventions. Shameful. I would highly recommend this book!! And I heart midwives!"
4,"glamorous, mysterious, seductive","Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance.As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem. Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top. Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by lace embroidery on the glass.The scent is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest. With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey. The man in my life called it ""delicious,"" and I do, too. It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.Gail Cooke"
5,Wonderful fragrance,"Beautiful fragrance. I get compliments every single time I wear it. Sweet with just a touch of spicy. Noticeable, but in a subtle ""she smells nice,"" way and not ""what bag of perfume just walked in the door,"" kind of way. I love it!"
1,beyond dissatisfied,"I was sent the wrong item at first and when they sent the ""correct"" perfume it smelt nothing like the real product. The bottle also didn't look like the real bottle. If i could rate an item with no stars, I would definitely rate them with none."
5,Sweet and Seductive,"I had sprayed some of Armani's Code on my wrist while at a local beauty store to see how it would wear on me and I got hooked. In fact, unable to purchase it at the time I saved up until I could and then went searching for it. It's now easily one of my favorite perfumes and I always get complimented on how nice I smell when wearing it."
2,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE ANGEL SELLER,"This store is a rip-off beware of this store angel seller, you will buy something from them and they will send you whatever they want, I bought original perfume they sent me a tester, and they argue that I bought tester, what a pitiful store trying to get advantage of their customers."
1,Wrong Item,"When I ordered this product, the website specifically stated a 2.5 oz bottle of the perfume would come. I paid a higher amount for the bigger bottle, however was shipped a 1.7 oz bottle. I was not shipped the correct product. I have also emailed the company and have yet to hear back. Looks like a claim will need to be done."
1,armani code,"I bought this parfume for me wife, i was very upset because the bottle was broken and soaked the box that came with it.Also i dont think it was an original perfume, I know it because I buy a lot of name brand perfumes and this one looked fake."
4,excellent,"I was very pleased with the overall service. I received my order on time, everything was well packaged and the perfume was in its original packaging. All went well."

With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey. The man in my life called it ""delicious,"" and I do, too. It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.Gail Cooke"
4,"Armani Code By Giorgio Armani For Women- Great scent, not long lasting","I ordered the Armani Code By Giorgio Armani For Women. Eau De Parfume Spray 2.5 oz, and am very pleased. Armani Code is a beautiful fragrance with hints of Blood Orange, Ginger, Pear Sorbet, Sambac Jasmine, Orange Blossom, Seringa Flower, Lavender Honey, Precious Woods Complex, and Vanilla. The scent is sexy and sweet, but still musky. I get constant complements on the scent. Unfortunately, after a few hours the scent power dulls significantly. The fragrance is a bit costly, so best for special occassions."
3,Not feminine enough,"I liked Code when I was at the department store, and I liked the samples I took home. It was a nice understated musky but feminine scent. When I ordered it online, it smelled different--too musky without the femininity. I wrote to Amazon and I was sent another bottle which is maybe a little better. I wonder if the scent gets damaged in transit due to the very hot weather?"
4,Love the Scent,I purchased this product after smelling a sample from a magazine. It is a soft scent that is not overpowering for work.
5,My wife and I love this stuff!,"I wear the men's version, while my wife wears the women's. Very classy scent. We love them both."
2,"nice scent, when you can smell it.","I sprayed a tester sheet at a perfume counter with this scent. After shopping a bit, I went back and decided to buy it. It's nice and light, but after wearing it for the first time, I realized it's TOO light. I couldn't even smell it when I held my wrist to my nose. The second time, I decided to apply more. I must've used 6-7 sprays and still, only a lingering aroma. For the amount you have to use and the faintness of the scent, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Unhappy,I purchashed purfume in Nov for a Christmas gift. the product i recieved was a fake. It smells nothing like the real thing the labeling and bottle are different i am very dissapointed.
1,fake parfume,I just want to warn you guys that this parfume is fake!The smell goes away after 30min.very disapointed.The box is fake too.Think twice before you buy it!
3,Too strong,I find this perfume too strong. I had purchased the lighter version before and am not regretting buying this. It's too strong even with one single spray.
5,Armani Code,While in Sephora planning to buy Fantasy By Britney Spears I came across the Armani Code. It was kinda hard to miss since there was this GIGANTIC Poster advertising it. So I thought there's no harm testing it right?? I sprayed a little bit on a test strip and fell IN LOVE with it. It smells amazing!!!! It mainly smells like Lavendar to me which is one of my favorite scent. It lasts for about maybe 4 hours so if you go to school or work you might need 1 or 2 refreshes. I spray about 2 squirts each. Also on the days that you want to try something different I recommand the Pink Sugar by Aquolina and Miracle Intense by Lancome.
2,NOT HAPPY,"This perfume does not have any staying power, whatsoever! You would think a product from Armani would.....or maybe it was just so old that it's lost it's oomph. (Which would be the sellers fault) I don't know where the responsibility lies, I do know that I would never buy this product again."
4,Surprisingly nicer than I expected,"This smells quite nice actually. My expectations were not too high but it pleasantly surprised me. Be careful however not to soak up in the fragrance as it could be overwhelming, a little goes a long way."
5,Smell of heaven,"This is really worth everything it stands for- no wonder it is a classic. It is incredible. I never bought a perfume without smelling it before this one, my god I did NOT regret it. This was absolutely amazing."
3,"Received item on time, Poor packaging for price charged","I purchased this item as a gift for Christmas. It arrived on time as promised, but was improperly packaged. The product box was in barley acceptable condition due to being wrapped in a USPS envelope and labeled. For $10 in shipping it should have been properly Boxed."
1,IT IS FAKE,"I bought one and it exactly look different when compared with the original.also,the scene dont last long.the appearance looks really different when carefully looked because, it is not original."
1,junk,"It's simply another piece of junk by those ""artists"" and ""novelists"" from China who try to make money and ""fame"" in the West by deliberately finding weird things in the country to entertain western audience. I don't see any traces of art from the pains of the dead, the sick, the handicapped, the decayed, the dissected, the amputated, or the female organ of a little girl, which will be regarded as a child porn/abuse in the U.S.Personally I doubt the preference, motives and taste of the editor of the book.W. Zhang"
1,Liu Zheng: The Chinese,"The images and information provided by this book is outdated and very misleading to the western readers. The author simply picks up those old pictures, that mostly reflect the Chinese life around 70s and 80s, which is no longer the main stream of Chinese current life style at all."
3,Decent bio of a legendary band in decline.,"First off, a warning to those expecting the ""rare footage of the Lawton era line-up"". Oh it's there all right, but all the sound is dubbed in from the albums. The reviewers tend to be on the mark most of the time and offer vastly different opinions of the 1977-1980 albums, which gives this a ring of validity. Not everything Heep did was fantastic and this bio spotlights both the high and low points of this era. Gerry Bron gets old pretty quickly with his consistently negative perspective on everything Heep did after 1973. Ok, so Byron was the classic Heep vocalist, does Bron have to point that out every time he's on screen? Still, the overall picture is pretty good. You get generous song samples from each album, which allow the viewer to get a good perspective on the band's changing direction as the 70's came to a close. Definitely worth a rental and if you're a really big Heep fan then probably worth buying."
4,"fun, great voices, great music","Loved this album...it's fun how some classic american songs in country and other areas sound like Classical Art Songs. Check out ""Riders in the Sky"" ""Blue Bayou"" and the dogs in the last track. I smiled and laughed listening to it. Clearly this group of musicians were having fun!"
2,"different, but...","I enjoyed the variety and listening to some opera stars I've heard elsewhere, but somehow they just don't seem to be given a chance to shine in their own individual styles or songs. It's fun to listen to these great voices sing cowboy music and you can imagine and feel the fun they had recording this. But... one song irritates me so much I don't play this as much as I like - they have gunshots going off and somehow as I'm driving through the streets of DC or sitting in my house I really don't like the shock of hearing a gunshot go off."
1,She looks like Kumi.,"Jade is my favorite Bratz character but she is not beautfiul here.I think this must be Kumi instead.SARA SIBLINI!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*1/2 MY SCENE LOVER,1/2 MY SCENE HATER"
2,Hard as a brick,"I have had this seat on my bike for about three weeks and have ridden my bike about a dozen times since then. Since i put the seat on my bike i have been hoping that the seat will soften up as i use it, kind of like breaking in a pair of shoes. I have had no luck. It is just as hard now and pretty uncomfortable as when i got it. I also think the picture is a little decieving. the groove in the middle of the seat to protect mens sensitive parts on the seat is just a little dimple, where in the product picture it looks like a large opening that goes all the way through the seat. In fact i have another BELL seat on my old bike that looks more like the picture than this one i just bought. The old one came from my local ""Big"" Store. I wish i would of just went and got another one of those. It looked like this picture and had a deep groove and was very comfortable."
4,I'm happy with it.,"I got one thru walmart and it looks nearly identical still a bell product. Either way I think its funny reading up all the neg reviews that ppl write up for bell seats. The whiniest cats on the planet, since its gel and thicker its supposed to mate with my butt and be as comfortable as moms couch boohoo. In comparison to the stock seat with the gel slip over this is comfortable. Granted its not moms couch but it sure beats stock seats or ""jumping on the bicycle with the seat missing""-Lt. Frank Drebin"
2,Kee Ka clothes,I was pleased with the quality of the shirts from Kee-Ka but so disapointed tht the sizing was so far off on every shirt or outfit that I ordered. I ordered an 18-24 month old shirt and it barely would fit a 5 month old.I would not order their products again because of the sizing and I am returning everything from them
3,good thing I bought on SALE!!,These shirts are extremely thin and the picture is very small. I only payed $7 a shirt so I use them for my son as undershirts. I was too lazy to return them as I was expecting a lot out of quality due to the original price of $24.
5,Very Cute,"Very cute tee that I got for a great price. My daughter is a little ""cupcake"" so it is apropos."
4,"Decent quality, great price","I bought these to replace the cheap knobs on a dresser that I refinished last summer. They look as good as new several months later. The finish is beautiful and they have a decent weight to them for inexpensive knobs. Many of the knobs in this price range at my local hardware store felt very cheap and when you placed your fingers on them to ""pull"" the back side of the head was concave. So here is the best part, these knobs are flat on the back and feel very nice to pull. My only complaint... these are not made in the USA."
2,Broke on second use,"The architecture is great. Lots of leverage. Unfortunately, the second time I used them the blade broke. I had to send them back to Fiskars directly because there is only a short window to return them to Amazon."
5,What a great feel!,"When you are using pruners, it's all about how it feels in your hand and how easy it is to use. I don't want something that is going to hurt my hand after a 1/2 hour and is going to be a constant strain on me. I really like the Fiskars brand and I have come to find that they have quality stuff. We have started collecting their different lines for gardening and outdoor tools.I had a set of pruners that were just difficult to open, difficult to get to cut and difficult to close again. These, I have found, are very user-friendly. They cut great and they fit in your hand even better!I would recommend these pruners to any avid gardener or yard worker out there!"
3,Less sturdy than expected.,"The handles are very lightweight, cheap-feeling plastic that don't seem like they'll withstand Tucson heat after being stored in a garage after time (though they may surprise me).The blades are smaller than expected, too. They are fine for smaller cuts, like the little suckers that grow (as long as you get to them while they are still supple and not to large).On a positive note to Fiskers, this is the easiest opening cardboard-backed hard plastic front package ever. No crimping, power staples, sealant... just pop it open in a half of a second. Nice."
5,Solid Product,"Have used this frequently for many pruning tasks. Works well on 1/2"" stock. The handle is comfortable for my XL mitts. A quality well built product. I'm looking forward to many years with my Fiskars Shears. Highly recommended"
4,pruning shears,"Having good luck with these garden shears -- I have them with me every time I work in the yard. The shears do a great job at making clean cuts when pruning or shaping a plant, or cutting flowers to take inside. The only issue I have had with the shears is with the lock; the tab that locks the shears doesn't slide into the channel so the shears are always open."
5,easy to hold,"hard to rave about primers, but this one is really adaptable tor the ease of use. The quality of the metal is such that blades cut quickly, easily, and effectively. Would buy it again without hesitation."
4,Excellent pruners for the money,"These are inexpensive, yet durable and very comfortablePros:- price is great for the quality- durable and replaceable blade- ergonomics are great. fits both lefty and righty. i like to switch hands while pruning and they're great for that. you should still wear your gloves though as the handle is plastic and without gloves you'll have blisters in no time.Cons:- specified cutting capacity is a joke, just like with all shears. the specified capacity is the opening of the pruner jaws, not the thickness of a branch you can actually cut. expect that you can cut up to about half inch on hardwood and a little more on softer woods. on something extra hard, 3/8"" at best. carry your lopper to handle branches this can't.- the handles are relatively large. if you have small hands, these will be uncomfortable, but you won't find pruners that can cut this size branches and fit small hands - just use a lopper."
3,Blade Broke on Third Use,"Ordered it 11-05-2012. Just used it for third time pruning crepe myrtles. I went after the pencil sized growths when blade broke in two. I trust blades can easily be replaced, otherwise design is great; it feels good in the hand. Hope the micro-tip that I purchased does better."
4,First pair was defective... second one seems fine,"I purchased this on Gold Box deal and it was defective... the latch that keeps it closed would not engage after a really tough time opening it. I mentioned the GB deal because when Amazon shipped me a new pair the price had dropped by a buck and had I checked before asking for a replacement I'd just done a return and made a new purchase for the savings... because that's how cheap I am! As usual, Amazon made the return simple and shipped a replacement right away. My wife has a very small hand and this pair is a great fit for her because of the angled handles. I gave it 4 stars because the first one was defective but otherwise I'd be going with 5."
2,Safety does not work,"I ordered these and received them immediately. The safety would not latch. I returned them for a second pair via Amazon. The latch appeared to work, but after using them the latch would not rehook. They do work nicely but are dangerous when it he safety does not latch."
2,Not good,The shears are fine but the lock mechanism was very difficult to get undone and won't go back into the locked position. So my shears are stuck open 24/7. Not to handy for carrying or putting in your pocket.
3,Not sturdy enough,After a few uses the blades no longer slide tightly against one another - so partly-cut branches slip between blades. You get what you pay for - should have bitten the bullet and purchased a Felco.
2,Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears,It's sharp and cuts well but had difficulty opening them the 1st time and am unable to re-close them as the 'catch' is off a little bit.
5,Pruning Shears,"I needed a sharp pruning shears to prune my woody roses and other hardy plants. After a review of the available products, I ordered Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears, which I found to be very effective and sharp even against hardy wooded branches. An Excellent product at a Very Good price"
5,yard,sharp and easy on the eye and hand. very functional in appearance and use. good leverage when cutting branches. nice
5,gardeners must have,my mom loves to garden and these were perfect for her she trims a lot of pushes and plants and these are great for all those
2,Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears,This product was for my wife - for pruning indoorsit is too big for her small handdo you have a smaller size or should i return itmark cooper
1,Junk,Had for one year and it wrotted out. Cheap junk Would not recommend .Ccheap rubber.. I don't write reviews often Burt this one buens me. Boat fuel ines are critical when on the great lakes so this is uneceptable and dangerous.
1,Junk!,"I have been equipping a new boat all Winter and purchased this pump bulb with all other fuel line components. Finally ready to take it out this Spring only to discover two leaking cracks in the Moeller pump. This pump is not 6 months old, never been used, never in sunlight and is cracked/rotted like it was 20 years old. I thought Moeller was a premium brand.Woodman"
5,eruption,"this lp was released in 1978 and changed the rock landscape forever !! , an absolute classic and indispensable if you are arock fan !"
5,The Beginning of The Beast!,"This is the album that started it all! It pretty much changed the way we listen to Hard Rock/Heavy Metal today. Recorded in 1977 and released in 1978, this album still sounds as fresh as the day it came out. Ask any Van Halen fan on what their favorite album is by them, and I guarantee that most of them will say Van Halen 1. Definitely one of the greatest rock albums of all time! A must-buy from any hard rocker! \m/"
5,VH Fanatic!,"This stuff is awsome! It only makes me want to live through the 70's and 80's when I hear this stuff. This stuff is timeless, if you havn't heard songs like You Really Got Me and Eruption then you gotta. If you have albums like Back in Black and Led Zeppelin IV then you have to add this album to your collection now!"
5,An old album that holds its own now - with phenomenal sonics,"Everyone has heard these songs over and over again... but you haven't heard them on RTI 180 gram vinyl. This pressing is excellent, on a good system it's easily better than the CD including the remastered Best of Both Worlds CDs which sound pretty good for CD. This is a great sounding pressing that won't make you think you overpaid for an old record you could have got on ebay for a few bucks. It's first class with a nice heavy poly record sleeve and a poster/liner notes on the inside. Im very happy with this LP, it's all that makes vinyl great and none of what vinyl doesn't do well. And like I said, it's top notch music everyone has heard too. It's just a win win win. If you like vinyl or Van Halen or both, just get it."
5,GREATEST BAND EVER!,"Van Halen 1 may be the greatest album ever with the exception of Boston. Eddie Van Halen with his hammer-on tapping tecnique has changed rock and roll even to this day and likely forever. If you havn't lstened to song s such as Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love and Runnin' with the Devil, then get the damn album!"
5,Essential for all lovers of hard rock guitar,From 'Running With The Devil' through 'On Fire' the band plays a tight set that was recorded almost completely live. You get over dubbed guitar on one song - Jamie's Crying. The songs are not just boring heavy metal guitar exercises either. Every song is catchy.There are no serious messages to be found in any of these songs. Just pure fun. This is the ultimate music for riding around in your car.Even though VH 1 came out a million years ago the songs hold up well. It's heavy pop music and it's great!This cd comes with the highest recommedation.
5,fast and furious,The guitar playing on this album is unreal. The tone is massive and the solos have real bite.
5,Classic!!!!,"For fans of the current Van Halen, or of the Sammy era who haven't listened to the earlier stuff, this album is a must have. It is a rawer, more earthy VH than we're used to, and it reminds us of where the Gods started out. It is one of the CDs that you simply must own. From the opening track straight through to the closer, you cannot find a more powerful show of muscianship. Don't miss it."
5,a piece of rock and roll history,This CD is the remastered work of Van Halens first LP. Every song is classic and this remains my favorite of the Roth era albums. The highlight for me is still Eruption; Eddies signature guitar solo that made the world stop and take notice.
5,"van halen,s smokin,debut album!!!","van halen,s amazing debut album was released in 1978.this album has just gotta be one of the strongest most kicka@@hard rock debut albums ever!!from the first cut;runnin,with the devil you knew as a rock fan that this band was like NO other!eruption is an amazing smack in the face work of guitar mastery from eddie!every song on this album just smokes!there are no [filler]tracks!!!this l.a. band was out to blow the plaster off your walls if you cranked this album loud enough!!i wish i would have seen van halen on this tour or any bettween 1978 and 1984,my favorite period of van halen is when david lee roth was lead singer..no disrespect to sammy hagar!!if you get this album..turn it up loud!!!"
5,EDDIE!!!,"More than anything, this romperstomper of an album was the coming-out party for the 80s' best guitarist, and one of the top 5 most innovative guitars of all time: Eddie Van Halen. Aside from the brilliant songs, every one a classic, it was a showcase for Eddie's enormous skills on the guitar: fiery, melodic, and very fun. Listening to these songs is like being 17 in 1978, cruising all night and smoking dope, living it up. In my opinion, no rock album reaches the sheer zenith of this high-flying album, the band on top of their game and loving every minute of it. 34 minutes of the best rock ever made."
5,THE ONLY REVIEW YOU NEED TO READ,"This album is so F'ing good it brings tears to my eyes. Bands today just dont make music like this, actaully they haven't been making music like this for close to 10 years now. The music sounds so simple, but its really deep wich makes it such a classic. It's hard to believe that it was made in 1978 and still sounds so fresh in 2003. I think if Van Halen was a new band and this album was released, it would be considered just as groundbreaking today as it was 24 years ago.To sum up this review. If you like music, like Hard Rock music, pick this motherf'er up. You dont have any excuses not to."
5,AWESOME TAPE!!,I wanna say awesome tape and speed of delivery. I actually got the tape earlier then previously indicated.
5,keep listening!,On the list of 1000 best rock songs these songs wound up sixth!!! Led Zeppelin was first with Stairway to Heaven!!
4,Great classic VH.,Not my fave VH album but a very good one indeed!Love Dave era Halen - awesome!The remastered version sounds great!
5,The one that started it all!,"The debut Van Halen album in one word....ROCKS from the first track to the last track. It introduced us to a guy whose guitar playing was unlike any heard in the late 70's. Not to repeat what others might have said but this CD probably saved hard rock as it was way back then for you kiddies not yet even born. So if you dont own this one, you should pick up a copy and listen to it...then repeat again. AT LOUD VOLUMES!!!"
5,Landmark,"Hard to believe this is a blast from the past. My son is learning some of the guitar solos so I've had a chance to listen to the disc quite a bit lately. It really shook up the rock/metal scene, didn't it? In some respects, this is not a five star album. I mean, it's a classic and I love it, but as an album, it is not as consistent as a five star disc should be. I can appreciate Atomic Punk for what it is, for example, but it disturbs the flow. On Fire never did much for me, sorry to say. But the good is really good. The playing is incredible and Dave's singing style fits the music. Michael Anthony was a highly under-rated background vocalist. These guys were such a great band and the evidence is all right here."
5,Guitar revolution in +30 minutes,"Eventhough the album is really short, only +30 minutes, it features the revolutionary technique of Edward Van Halen, one of the most imitated guitarists ever. (Take ""Eruption"" and try to compare it with other guitar solo of the same years) The album shows a monster's birth, back in the days when they got all the energy of the world with songs like ""I'm the one"", the cover of the Kinks ""You really got me"" and the classic ""Ain't talking 'bout love"". It's evident the showmanship of David Lee Roth, eventhough he doesn't have great technical skills like the rest of the band."
5,At Last,"Almost 22 years after it's release it still sounds fresh and good, but one thing to note. Warner Bros has ""Digitally Remastered"" the first 6 VH albums from I to 1984. What does this mean? It means that the sound quality is better then ever, also meaning ""get rid of your old VH CD's and get the Remastered versions with all ORIGINAL ARTWORK (YOU KNOW THE ARTWORK FROM THE VINYLS)"". It was in mid September that i found out that Warner Bros recently did this (they did the samething with Dire Straits as well too), i was upset at first because, i now had to replace my old VH cd's and get the 6 remasters (at a good price too). If you are a Die-Hard VH fan, you must replace your old VH cd's and get these, they are worth the buy, and sound so much better making old VH blasting their way through the 21th Century for generations to come. (Cool Huh!!!!!)"
5,Just plug it in an play,"Nothing fancy here. Edward's use of the hammer-on & hammer-off technique has been copied by every guitarist since this 1977 release. The 'instrumental' ""Eruption"" is the most aptly-titled song ever. And to think that Ed did it in one take. Their cover of the Kink's ""You Really Got Me"" will make your skin crawl and get you blood flowing..........any fool who thinks he/she has a complete library of timeless rock without this album is truly a fool."
5,Stands the test of time,"I hear this CD 25 years later and the music holds up well. One of the best albums in the 20th century. Even though it's short (buy VHII, Woman and Children First, and Fair Warning if you want more) and hear what the big deal was back then. 1984 took them to newer heights, but pales in comparison to the young raunchy talented band they once were."
5,The Best Van Halen Music,"The Best Van Halen Music, The Best Van Halen Music, The Best Van Halen Music, The Best Van Halen Music, Wish they can get it together as a band and tour again"
5,5 stars,"Doesn't get much better than this, Van Halen 1 is probably their best album and all of the songs are worth listening to. If your intent on seriously getting into Van Halen I would buy the albums in the order in which they were released starting with this oen."
5,Van Halen's first was also their best,"Van Halen was a band that pretty much singlehandedly changed the face of rock. Combining Eddie Van Halen's stunning virtuosity with the flamboyant antics of frontman David Lee Roth, they reset the standards for hard rock. Their self-titled debut is another one of those rare albums that does not have one bad track on it, and has stood the test of time far better than their other works. Even non-VH diehards should know this album pretty well, since classic rock radio rotates about 60% of it. This is the essential Van Halen album--I would recommend it over any of their other albums and even their greatest hits package for newcomers (i.e. anyone who still has a -teen in their age). It's a fun album to listen to, Dave never sounded better, and Eddie absolutely shreds. Another one of my desert island disks without question. Buy two copies so you'll have a backup when you wear the first one out!"
5,One of rocks best debut albums!!,"Back before the break up, and van hagar and Van Halen 3.Van Halen Ruled the rock world, kinda like the circusthey were greatest show in rock.Back when they were still playin for the music.In 1984 the egos went the extra mile.This album is a must have for any Van Halen fan!!ATOMIC PUNK ROCKS!!I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!"
3,Remastered Premiere,"There's only so much remastering can accomplish with Van Halen's early catalog if not remixing from scratch. And make no mistake --these CDs are AAD, not ADD-- which is ancient CD nomenclature for digitally remastering an old analog stereo master. But this time they used a better analog master, or so the story goes, until they find a better one.But a complete remastering would have had little impact on Van Halen I if digital gurus were faithful to the original mix. Because let's face it; Ted Templeman was a pretty ... producer --packing Eddie's guitar off hard on one side of the mix and submerging Michael Anthony's pedestrian bass playing below audible levels. And for all of Eddie's talking up his ""brown sound"", his guitar sounds more or less like an overdriven AM radio drenched in cheap echo on this CD.That's not to say the performances aren't top drawer, though completely dated and a bit off the cuff, and the CD is sure to please anyone who only wants one Roth Van Halen CD."
2,Saved Rock Music?,"Some people are saying this saved rock, Are you kidding me? i'm left confused and dumbfounded as to how this saved rock. This band along with Def Leppard, single handedly destroyed hard rock/metal for the entire 80's. They basically gave birth to pop metal with this album, all of the Jovi's,Ratts,Wingers,Crues and poisons that plaged the 80's with there bull$hit music owe thanks to this album. I give it two stars because i repect eddies musicianship, but the damage done by this album was horrendus. After this, it was suddendly cool for bands to start writting insipid songs about partying, rocking out and girls amoung other juvinile subjects and start dressing in spandex. Who knows, maybe metal might have been a respectable gendre in music if this has never came out, metal would not have to be disgraced by being associated with motley crap and poison in the ear."
2,A Fine Debut,"With songs like ""Runnin' With The Devil"", ""You Really Got Me"", and ""Jamie's Cryin'"", you have to acknowledge Van Halen's self-titled debut album, as one of the best debut albums of the the 70's. ""Runnin' With The Devil"", arguably Van Halen's best song, and ""You Really Got Me"", arguably one of the best cover songs of all time, were the hits that propelled not only this particular album, but also Van Halen's career to success."
5,The Ultimate Van Halen CD,"Van Halens first is the best. Running With The Devil, Eruption, Ain't Talkin About Love, Little Dreamer. This cd started it all. 5 stars."
4,"This debut is ""On Fire"".","Possibly Van Halen's best record, and definitely their best with David Lee Roth. ""1984"" was another highlight of the Dave years, but this 1978 album is incredible. As much as it unleashed the band on the world, it also sent Eddie Van Halen to the top of the guitar god list. You can hear half of this on the radio on any given day. Hits included are ""Runnin' With The Devil"", ""You Really Got Me"", ""Aint Talkin' 'Bout Love"", ""Jamie's Cryin'"", and the still amazing ""Eruption"". And the rest is nearly as sweet. This debut was simply Dave's best, as Sammy's best with them was ""5150"". Overall an essential rock record."
1,highly overrated cd,"the only good tracks are you really got me,ain't talkin bout love and ice cream man.when ever i listen to this cd these are the only three tracks i listen to,the rest of the songs are not very good at all.david lee roth is a very overrated singer.this was the first and last van halen cd i'll ever buy.don't waste your money on this cd ."
1,Most OVERATED Singer Ever,"David Lee Roth ruined this whole album. I loved Eddie's guitar playing, but I just can't listen to this because of Roth horrible voice. The only songs I find remotelly listenable are Runnin With the Devil and Eruption every other song, nomatter how good Eddie is, sounds like crap thanks to Roth. DO NOT BUY, unless you want to listen to the most annoying singer of all time"
1,Crappy guitar playing for posers,"I can't believe people listen to this junk. This lame hair crap was never cool. There's a reason the great musicians you see on MTV don't dress or look like this. Anyway, the guitar work sucks. This Van Halen thinks he's so great. People say he pioneered a so-called ""technique"" (a REALLY bad one) called ""two handed tapping"" or something. When was the last time you saw great guitar players like Avril Lavigne, Ashlee Simpson or Kurt Cobain use this ""technique""??? Never, because - like Van Halen - it sucks. This song ""eruption"" or whatever the hell it is, is nothing more than amateur wannabee guitar playing. Now for REALLY good guitar playing, check out the aforementioned artists. However avoid losers with guitars such as:Van HalenAndres SegoviaAllan HoldsworthEric ClaptonSteve VaiJoe SatrianiMegadeth (especially Marty Friedman)John McLaughlinPaco De LuciaJohn PetrucciBB KingAl De MeolaJeff BeckYngwie MalmsteenGreg HoweChet AtkinsMichael RomeoRobert Fripp"
1,Would you still like it if it had no guitar solos?,"I don't understand ""music fans"" anymore. Newer Metallica stuff is awesome, it doesn't need solos.Is the only reason people like this because of the fancy solos?Solos are lame and fill up precious time in songs.Liking a cd only for solos is like liking a movie only for the sex scences.For a good metal cd, check out Metallica's St anger."
5,Stunning,"This album is probably one of the greatest testimonies to hard rock ever documented. If you have never heard this album, I can only apologize and hope you will get it together soon.The best work this band has done is documented in a very easy fashion. The best starting at 1978 and a slow steady fall to 1998. Although the ball really got rolling downhill after 1985.Buy the albums in the order they were released from 1978-1984 and after that, just stop. you will only dissapoint yourself."
5,absolutely great way to get the ball rolling!,"well van halen's first album was also their best album. it has everything it should. great guitar work, screaching vocals, thunderous drums, and michael anthonys calming bass prescence. it truly is a great album. my favorite song on the album is not running with the devil or aint talking bout love. however, its the acoustic bluesy rendition of ice cream man. van halen may have lost some of what made them famous over the years, but they still kick"
4,Great Debut Album,I bought this album when it first came out. I used to listen to it in the morning before school while my sister styled my hair. I played this album from start to finish just about every day. It's too bad David Lee Roth left the group. I miss those days (and my hair :-)
1,Junk,This maazine is Junk if you want porn get hustler. If you want a Motorcycle magazine get Cycle world thios is nether. It is only good for one thing garbage.
4,This is an excellent project from an excellent group!,"This is the first project Karen Peck and New River released on the Spring Hill label, and they did a fine job. A wonderful blend of southern gospel with an edge of contemporary country starts this project out with the fast-paced title track ""Turn It Loose"" and continues with strong songs such as ""UFO"" and ""Christian In The House"". These numbers are sure to get your toe tapping as you sit back and enjoy the ministry of this group. Also of note on this project are the soothing ballads, ""His Tomb Wasn't Empty"" and the ever uplifting ""How On Earth"". What a message on the cross of Christ! This song is sure to stir up emotion. Finally, there is the hauntingly beautiful ""Where Eyes Don't Cry"", a song where the music and words just linger in your mind for hours after you've turned it off. A nice project well done."
5,"Try it, you'll like it!","This is silky smooth, not greasy or sticky, delectable and lightly scented. Use on your best sheets, washes right out."
1,Waste of money...,"The item came with a broken seal and looked as if it has been used. The cork was also stuck and as I tried to open it, the cork broke into half so I couldn't open it. Threw it away right away. Waste of money..."
1,Died in 3 weeks.,"I live in Mexico so I had this shipped to a friend in Florida who brought it to me on a visit. The mixer lasted three weekends and quit. Since it is a hassle to return to the factory from here and may be held up in customs on return, I requested technical help from the company. It has been over two weeks and I have not heard from them."
3,Good little stand mixer,"I have never owned a stand mixer and wanted to dabble with one before committing a lot of money. I like this one, but I only use it occasionally. It more than meets my expectations and my needs. I probably will keep this one to use and save a couple of hundred dollars."
4,worth every penny,"The Euro-Pro stand mixer is worth every penny. It does everything a stand mixer costing $250 does, at a fraction of the price. The only thing it is not, is heavy duty, but unless you are using this product everyday, it is well worth the price."
1,It is terrible,"I bought this mixer 7 months ago. It still looks great and runs great. I have not had a single problem out of it. It holds up great for the light duty things I use it for. If you are looking for a tough mixer to do big jobs though I would go for a larger one. I am comepletely pleased with this mixer and am very happy with my purchase.Update: The beaters are cheaply made, they broke after not much use. I ordered more 2 months ago and have yet to receive them, although a month ago I did receive a card saying they were back ordered (this was after waiting a month). So it is useless at this point. Do yourself a favor and order a few extra sets of beaters. I"
2,"Great mixer, but . . .","This is a really good mixer. It looks even better than the picture. It's very powerful and has several different speed and speed combinations. The bowl itself has three speeds. So, why the low rating? Because the mixer I got was used. I don't mean it had just been taken out of the container. This mixer was used enough that the surface is scuffed. I would mail it back but various factors make that very difficult at this time. This is a great mixer and it doesn't seem like they'd do this a lot of people, but if you want a new mixer you might want to try another one."
4,I love it!,"I'm so in love with this mixer! Forget the retro red, that's icing on the cake....I was raised in the 60's with a good ol' Hamilton Beach all-American lasts 4ever type. Wish I still had that one. But...I thought this one would be junk like about everything else one buys these days. It was fine. It's easy to use, I really like the quality of the plastic and metal bowls, and the ""spatula""'s unique and very handy It also comes with regular and dough attachments and the manual. I got a $50 amazon.com Gift Cert for XMas and I'm thrilled to have used it for this. (I would have gladly paid cash for it, as well, it's worth the price!)"
3,Good for Light Use,"This mixer has a good deal of power but doesn't get some of the foods I mix to the smooth consistency I am used to. If you rarely use a mixer or need it for moderate mixing purposes then this will probably work fine for you. However, if you are wanting something with better performance go ahead and invest in a higher-quality mixer."
4,Propeller Hat,"Perfect gift for the tech-weenie in your life. As a System Engineer, I present these to ""technical"" sales people."
4,A humerous singing story of a bear and a lonesome boy.,"I read this book 50 years ago, enjoyed the storyline and sang their song. I was delighted that it was still in print for my grandson (and me) to enjoy together. Some young memories tarnish with age. This book is as delightful today as it was in the 40s. Can't beat that for universality."
5,"Bananas, for baby... or for space flight",Anyone searching for stage 3 of gestational banana trajectories would be well advised to procure this item immediately. It is an essential purchase. That is all.
5,1968 presidential election,"president johnsons bet on escalating the war in vietnam and the opposition to his social programs turned the american people to the republican party and their strategies. has rare photographs of the candidates, etc."
3,NOTHING NEW,"There is nothing here that one cannot read elsewhere and possibly with greater detail. This book focuses on the 1968 election as the pivotal election of the second half of the 20th Century and does not give a convincing argument as to why.The chapters centers on the primary political figures of that year (Johnson, McCarthy, Kennedy, King, Humphrey, Wallace, Nixon, etc) and how each candidate contributed to the 1968 political landscape. But I felt the treatment of each individual was at best superficial and contributed little to an understanding of any of them or the electoral process in 1968."
2,I tried to like this book...,"I tried to like this book, but i just didn't care for it. In fact, I forced myself to finish just so I could hurry on to something else. Way too much side character explanation and not enough of Simon S. I won't be purchasing anymore of this series."
3,Fell flat,"This book had such potential, but fell flat in my opinion. The description makes the book sound like a mystery/thriller, but it's written more like a drama. It felt like it was extremely drawn out, and at times I was completely bored. I picked the killer out half way through the book, but never really understood why he killed. There wasn't much momentum through the book. The shocker at the end was completely unfulfilling. And why it's called a Simon Serrailler mystery is beyond me. You barely see the man throughout the book and by the end you know next to nothing about him"
3,Great writing but plot disappoints,"Susan Hill is a talented writer, but I won't be reading any more of her books--(plot spoiler warning)unlike real life, the author has choices. When you spend a significant portion of the book focused on a sympathetic character, you do not kill them off in a particularly heartless way. I have also sworn off Elizabeth George for the same reason. As far as her ""main character"" Simon Serrailler, he is another boringly enigmatic, artistic policeman.If you want to read mysteries with a heart, I recommend Sophie Hannah, Charles Todd or Donna Leon."
3,An unsatisfying mystery,"As a novel it was moderately entertaining and relatively well written. As a mystery, it was unsatisfying. The author gradually reveals the identity of the murderer, well before the end of the novel, and before the police solve the mystery. The author treats the main detective with a cruelty worthy of Susan George, who is unparalleled in the awful fates she devises for her detectives."
3,Not a quick read,"Hill writes well, and her ghost story The Woman in Black is a favorite. Although this is well written, too, and interesting (although it left me with some head scratching at the end), it's fine as a story set in an English town, but if you're looking for a straight-forward mystery, this might not be for you either. It's 562 pages long, by the way, so not for the impatient."
1,pointless brutality,"I'm referring here to the author! She goes to a great deal of trouble to get you to like her characters before she kills them off, so you're the real victim. Unless you enjoy being the subject of someone who plays with her food before she eats it, stick with normal human authors."
2,"Scholarly, but a low view of scripture","I only read through the first section, Galilee. Lake has a low view of scripture which is reflected in his scholarship. He views Christianity as the result of a Mix of Judaism and oriental traditions. This work may appeal to some, but not to me."
1,"Out of date,","Out of date. Out of date. Out of date. This book was published in 1987 with no updates. Whey, as the primary protein supplement didnt even exist at the time. Half the book is recipes. If thats what your looking for then by all means purchase it. If your looking for a diet strategy based current knowledge then look elsewhere."
1,grzesiek,"As good as Tito is, he ain't Polish in any sense of the word, so him being listed in a Polish section is just a glitch."
3,Good Jazz Fusion!!,"MusicSUBMIT.com alerted me to another musician, a guitarist from the Chicago area named Brad Ard. The track ""Diver Dance"" furthered my interest and I requested a CD for a review. Ard's guitar playing is bold and full of flavor, a mix of Jazz fusion, Rock and Funk. His sound quality is evident on tracks, ""Gas Bag"", and ""Goin' it"". My personal favorite was the track, ""Flight of the Hormone"". The CD reminds me of early Pat Metheny & Dan Gottlieb work, although the guitar work sounds more like Jeff Beck. This is a good listening CD for the jazz fusion fan."
2,Way to short,"This DVD has two partsA) how to use the DVX100A (20 minutes)B)how to shoot (40 minutes)A) how to use the DVX.Well, it gives basic information for a beginner with a big ""B"" as I am. I could find one or two valuable things but this is way to short to give me a good feedback.B) how to shootOne good info ""how to take 5 different views on one scene"".That's it.Furthemore, the production cost for filming this DVD:about 30 US$ including the graphics and the costs of the tape!I am not sure if this DVD worth the investment. On the net you can find more valuable tricks for your DVX. Otherwise, ask a friend who knows it and give him a drink!Laurent"
1,"Bad art, bad writing","It looks like a middle school project that someone's mother published.The inside is full of clip art, and the page format seems to change every few stories."
2,Not such a good deal,"These are the type of shirts that run wide and short. I also expect a lot of shrinkage, judging by the material. I really wouldn't recommend this. It also seems like it will fade very easily. (I bought black)"
1,These parts are NOT in the box!,"What you are seeing in the picture is a stock photo of some kind as my shipment contained four cap head screws and two stainless steel clips. None of these parts fit the application. I have no idea why, as the packaging was factory-sealed.As with all Amazon purchases, the return shipping charges will kill any savings you may have hoped to garner.The best advice: Read the ""Make sure it fits"" results several times; every word. Invariably, the last few words will describe an application that is not yours, even though nice large print will assure you it fits your vehicle."
5,Professional,Its very professional looking portfolio case. I use it to carry my 11x14 portfolio. I am so clumsy I need this thing. My portfolio is so pretty I don't want to nick it all up and if I didn't have this it would be all nicked up haha. I love it my portfolio looks as new as the day I got it!
4,Ideas about doing without government,"If you are interested in ideas about how society could operate without government -- taxes, laws, and regulations -- this book is for you. In particular, the concept on how to deal with intellectual property is by itself worth the price of the book.I found the exact scenario depicted in the story somewhat unlikely, but that is not the point.And if you didn't like ""Atlas Shrugged"", don't bother, you won't like this one either."
1,Stop the madness!,"A new, freedom-minded city in the Western US called Atlantis, to which the innovators and entrepreneurs flee... a speech on innovation, wealth, rationality, and politics... a villain called Wesley Couch...*groan*This book was in a ""free"" pile at the library and I don't wonder why. I didn't read it, but I flipped through it for the howlers."
3,Across the Years,"Edward Packard wrote two types of ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" stories. Those that are meant for Young Adult (6 grade) readers and those for just young readers (2-3 grade). This is one of the latter.Trying to put the star up on the christmas tree you fall and black out. Suddenly, you find yourself strapped in a machine along with two boys who claim their machine brought you back in time! Now you're on the move to find a way to escape OR if you like, you could spend christmas with the family.As with most of the younger reader books in this category there is no way to die. There is one ending where you may wish you were dead but that's all. Get this one for your younger children."
5,Riveting,"I couldn't put it down. Except for some of the local slang words, this book is easy reading in Spanish (I am not a ""native"" speaker); and, as far as the colloquialisms were concerned, I found myself eagerly looking them up in a slang dictionary. An amazing writer who has the ability to say so much with just a word!"
2,Decepcionante,"Bayly tiene otros libros mejores. Este ni siquiera está bien escrito. Si quieren leer algo de este autor que disfrutarán, mejor busquen ""Y de repente, un ángel"". Mucho mejor como libro."
3,on reggae U,"this video was ok..but it need more music...it was good as far as letting veiwers know who ""IS"" in reggae...and their.. start up and careers..."
1,Not Good,"Thought I had found a great deal but ended up having the unit replaced numerous times. Finally gave up and bought a different cable. Kept blowing a fuse and shutting down my computer-very scary. DO NOT recommend this product. Company was very good at replacing them, but it got a little ridiculous after the 5th and 6th one. Must have been a bad batch. You get what you pay for!"
1,Doesn't seem to work with Mac - nearly smoked my computer,"I tried 2 of these. When I plugged the first one in, I heard a 'Pop' and saw a small puff of smoke. My Computer (Power Mac dual G5) went dead. On advice of a tech, I opened the Mac and reset it, and turned it back on - it was fine. Whew. I tried the second cable (I know it seems dumb, but I assumed the problem with the first cable must have been a fluke, or due to static electricity or something. But the same thing happened with the second cable. To add insult, the supplier (Cables to Go) wouldn't provide any sort of refund, because the package had been opened.Bottom line, if you use a Mac, be very careful with these. Non-Mac PCs may be find - I haven't tried these cables with any of them."
1,"Few features, zero quality control","A uniquely designed power supply that has 5 male molex plugs for drive power. Attractive looking case. My version of the product had some problems, one fatal- Fatal: One of the 4 pin molex plugs on the power supply was wired backwards at the factory, putting 12v on the 5v lines to my hard drives. About $550 in damage to my stuff :(- Little annoyance: The thumb screws on the cabinet side aren't captured, so you have to keep track of them or they get lost- Little annoyance: The drive bays are nostalgiac. They're riveted to the chassis and it takes one back to the day when it was hard to mount drives in the cabinet.It's a value product in the best of times. Until however the QC is improved it should be approached with some caution."
4,Challenging Mathematical Problems With Elementary Solutions,"We, I and my students, really liked the book.It has place in praparing students for participation in mathematical contests. It is good for induvidual work, too.problems are ordered by topic, not by tehnique to be used, and that encourages student`s creativity. Hints, given along whit the complete solutions, help and guide them to the right solution. Also, they allow students to fine a different method of soluiton."
1,Disappointing,"What a disappointment! Lovers of classical music deserve more than this in the DVD format. The sound on this DVD includes the old ""tape hiss"" in the background - something listeners of quality CD's have long since forgotten. And to add to this, the video quality is often poor! Fuzzy pictures, not something you would expect in this new format. My recommendation: skip this DVD and listen to von Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic. A much more enjoyable experience"
5,Mind Blowing!,"If you've come this far, get this book- you are lucky to have discovered Andy Goldsworthy. And sit down before lifting the cover. The book is a testament to Goldsworthy's unique vision of his environment and skill as an artist and challenges you to believe that the seemingly impossible is possible. Not only are the sculptures genius, but the photographs are beautifully composed and the collection is mind blowing.You can do a google search on Goldsworthy and see the same pictures but it in no way compares to having the collection in an oversized book on your lap and being able to show your friends as you say, ""you will not believe this!"""
5,So Beautiful it brings tears to your eyes,"Some of the work is so beautiful I could cry. Some delight, some amaze, some leave you reflective. It makes you want to go out and experiment in the world yourself or take a walk. It is truly an amazing book."
4,A Collaboration with Nature,"The book arrived yesterday. Book is great but the packaging was inadequate for such a long journey ( to South Africa) and the plastic and therefore the dust jacket had been torn. The book arrived in only one sheet of thin vacuum packed layer of plastic - no brown paper, padded envelope or bubble wrap."
5,He is so smart,"Modern artists are often attacked because on the basis of ""I could have thought of that."" And true, you might say that about any given page in this book. Yet it's unbelievable that one man thought of all of them. Look at the photos in this book, and you'll see art everywhere the next time you walk outside. I could cover a wall with every page that is worth framing."
4,Lamy Cartridges Refill.,Good quality. They last a long time even with a medium point in the pen. Easy to use...just pop in the barrel
1,Poor description,Poorly described and didn't fit my Lamy pen. Would not buy againThere was no clear way described to return so I just threw away
3,expensive ink cartridges,"If you consider buying a fountain pen, I will recommend buying it with a converter because 1) the selection of ink is much, much greater when bought in bottles and 2) it is less expensive and 3) it is so much more ""in tune"" with the pleasure of writing with a fountain pen when you go through the ritual of filling it the old fashion way. Just my 5 cents worth of opinion!"
2,"Great Rack, Terrible Cover","The rack is fine, fairly sturdy. The cover, however, is a really cheap thin plastic that literally tore while I was tying it on the rack. By the end of the first winter it was in pieces. I recommend buying the rack without the cover and finding a cover elsewhere."
1,Cheap cover,The cover is worthless it will tear in a few days. The log frame is of good quality but don't pay extra for the light gauge plastic cover.
5,A Fairly Firm Tubular Metal Rack,"It's a tubular metal rack. It doesn't seem to flex at all with a full load of wood, even the sides, which you'd think would extend out under load. They do, but only a couple of inches. The only problem I had was making sure I stacked pieces on the bottom layer to form a base, them stack on some of the shorter cuts. Same thing applies to the sides. Because the wood is raised up, it looks like there is more wood stored on the rack than there really is, and I ended up buying a second rack to hold all I had stacked under a tree."
3,"well constructed, terrible cover","The rack itself was easy to assemble, and is well constructed. The cover is garbage. Speaking of garbage, you'd do better covering the rack with a garbage bag. The cover came out of the box already ripped at the seams, and as you try to put it on, it ripped in three other places. I didn't pull down on it excessively or attempt to do something it wasn't intended to do. It was simply a weak material."
1,Awful product,"I bought one of these, and the wind put the first rip in it the day after I put it out. Once the weather got cold, it pretty much completely disintegrated. This might by the worse single product I've ever paid money for. There is no way the people that designed and make these things didn't know how poor they were. I would be ashamed to have anything to do with producing and selling such a piece of garbage."
1,Badly designed and poorly made product,"This product should be pulled from their product line. I installed this log cover over my 8' log rack and I was immediately disappointed when one of the ties ripped off. Ok I said I will live with this. A few nights later we had a storm which included winds (not too high, maybe 20-30mph). After the storm I noticed that the Log cover was ripped in 3 places. I could not believe it. It was only a week old and this happened? As I write this I am contacting Landman for a full refund. The product looks like a tarp that one may purchase from a hardware store but in fact it is not the same. It is much thinner and much weaker and thus cannot stand up to outdoor weather. I do not recommend this product for anyone who has an outdoor log rack.Paul"
1,The cover is worthless,"Landmann 8 ft log rack with cover. The rack is fine, however, the cover ripped as soon as the first wind came along, even with it tied with the attached ties. Had to tape it with duct tape. Very disappointing as the cover is essential to keep the wood dry. Could have bought it without the cover and bought a tarp instead."
1,Horrible,"Cheap plastic that rips into shreds like paper after only 1 season. Look elsewhere for a stronger material. Bad product, cheaply made. If I could give this zero stars I would, but the minimum is 1 star so I had to give it that high a rating."
4,"Nice wood rack, cover low quality",The wood rack is very nice but the cover ripped the first time putting it on. It's a temporary fix til you find a better quality cover but the rack is good and does what it's supposed to do.....hold lots of wood!
3,Does What it is Suppose to Do,"This rack and cover are doing a great job at keeping our firewood dry, on the north side of our house in Southwest Washington. I am not sure how long it will last, but so far so good (6 months and a few wind storms)."
3,Rack is OK but cover isn't very durable,"If you're buying this rack/cover combo just because it has a fitted cover, then I'd suggest that you FORGET THIS ONE and keep on looking. The rack is OK and is easy enough to assemble but the cover is, well -- just flimsy. It's very thin material. I just opened it up today (Oct 27th) and I already have two small tears near the tie-downs just from fitting the cover on an empty rack. Geesh... I really doubt that it will last through any winter storms. I got this combo to sit on the driveway outside the front door for storing a face-cord of firewood close by. I figured the fitted cover would be a nice touch since it's going to be located at the front of the house. Now I'll be looking for a heavy tarp and getting out my sewing kit to make my own version."
2,Missing Parts & Rusty Sections,"I've purchased one like this before and it was close to perfect. This time however, it was short 4 bolts with washers and nuts. Had to run to the hardware store and paid $3.74 plus 1 hour of time to resolve it. Next, there were absolutely multiple places where rust was beginning to grow. ""Rust dust"" was in all plastic covered sections. Box looked old and worn like possibly even rained on before. I read the negative reviews in advance of this purchase but never thought it was going to happen to me. In short, I cannot reccommend this product. Too big of a ""pain"" to wrap it up and return it, but I should. The UPS point of orignation was out of Indiana, if anyone cares, that is."
3,"This rack is OK, but skip the cover!","The rack is fine, although I worry about it tipping over if it sinks into the ground at all. Maybe I will put some stone slabs under the feet to support it some more.The cover is a waste of money. It ripped apart as I was installing it initially, without any heavy force applied to it. Would not recommend the cover at all!"
4,Nice Product,We needed something to store logs on inside the garage and this product was perfect for our needs. We are very pleased w/ our purchase.
3,"Good stand, almost worthless cover","The stand is great, very good quality, thick metal will last a very long time. Lacks adjustment on the legs so make sure you have a level ground spot. However the cover is nearly worthless. Very thin vinyl, I doubt it will last a year in the AZ sun. Tie downs are hard to get tight, and it keeps blowing open. But for the money, I still think this was a great buy."
3,Log Rack review,Log rack is great but the cover is garbage. Ripped immediately when placed on the log rack after stacking all the wood. now I will have to spend another $62 for a new cover than can stand up to some light wind and rain.
4,Very nice,"Unit was received and assembled by my sons. The convenience of a rack is great. As opposed to ""throwing the wood up from below the deck. The cover leaves a bit to be desired. It's rather thin and during high winds, it ripped. But that's no big deal. It still covers 90% of the wood."
2,Flimsy construction,"I have the 8 foot rack setup on 6 concrete cinder blocks. Even with the stable foundation, the rack is very flimsy and I will be surprised if it is still standing next season. The 4 foot rack I bought from COSTCO was 3 times the weight of this 8 foot rack, but also three times the price. In this case, you get what you pay for."
2,Quality is so so,Cover is useless as just a little wind ripped it to shreds. The rack itself is ok and is to be seen how long it lasts. I tried to reach company and cannot find how to contact as it was sold by amazon
2,Details,"A rack is a rack, I suppose.. but they should really say outright that these things should ONLY go on concrete or heavy wood/bricks. Don't even think about putting this on grass, it will sink into the ground and fall over."
4,Easy to assemble and sturdy. Sudden price rise this week.,"This review is for the Landmann 82433 8-foot Firewood Log Rack without a cover.It is easy to assemble - 4 bolts for each end and 4 to attach the two four-foot sections together.It has plastic inserts in feet, so it can be assembled inside without scratching the floor.Since it is 8' long, I assembled the two 4' sections then took it outside to bolt the two sections together.I have not yet gotten around to stacking wood on it but it seems substantial enough.I paid $49.00 at Amazon a week before Christmas. The price has jumped since then by 17%. Today's price (Dec 28,2012) is $57.55.Update Jan 23,2013 -- After a year of use I am very happy with the rack. It fits nicely against the deck during the winter and under the deck when not in use. It has held up well. The price now is even lower than last year."
2,"Nice Rack, Terrible Cover","Rack is sturdy and easy to put together. Make sure you place on hard surface or set on bricks as the legs are very small and will simply sink into the earth when fully stacked. Cover lasted 7 months and was only exposed to sun and rain and did not make it to even see the snow season. I have the rack in a shaded area and the cover became incredibly brittle, I could only imagine how long it would have lasted in direct sunlight. Better off just buying the rack only and picking up a tarp at home depot."
3,Great Rack - HORRIBLE Cover,"I have to agree with most of the reviews on this site. The rack is great; it holds lots of wood, and it is sturdy. The cover, however, is truly a piece of garbage. It is flimsy and rips practically by itself. I recommend the rack by itself and a more sturdy cover option."
2,Poor quality cover for a low quality rack!,"The Landmann 8ft Firewood Log Rack is a huge disappointment.I haven't even owned this rack for 30 days and the cover is already torn to pieces. I should have known because the cover ended up with small holes in several places after CAREFULLY putting the cover on the full rack about 3 weeks ago. The rack is in a protected location with little wind. After our first snow several days ago, the entire side began separating from the top each time I opened the cover to fetch more logs. Now I see that there is a huge rip on the other side too.It's too early to tell how the rack itself will hold up, but I don't have high expectations. The design seems flimsy and I'm afraid the hollow tubes will end up rusting through and/or falling apart in a season or two. Would not purchase again. Unfortunately, we did not keep the original box. It's bad enough that I would unstack the wood so that I could return the rack."
3,Incomplete order,This wood storage rack product has 12 metal feet. All but one of them came with rubber cushions. Not fatal but an unfortunate negligent omission.Landmann 82433 8-Foot Firewood Log Rack Only
4,Nicely packaged,"I was anticipating a larger box that was heavy but the log rack was well packaged, light enough to carry around through my house in its box, and after putting it together makes a sturdy rack. There are three metal braces/brackets that provide additional stability I found good. The instructions recommend mounting on sturdy ground (e.g. gravel/pavement) I ended up just putting three pavers down in a newly cleared area which will keep the legs from sinking into the dirt and facilitating a tipping over event. Haven't put up the cover, still loading the rack, but looks like it will effectively keep rain out while still letting the wood dry."
3,Not the stated size!,"Although it seems like a sturdy product, it is not the stated size. It will not hold half of a face cord. The inside dimesions are 45.5"" x 39"". At half of a face cord is 48"" x 48"". We bought it specifically for it's size. We are very frustrated."
3,doesn't hold a full cord,"I am a 55 year old woman and put this together easily enough. Bought it because the wood is off the ground. However, I bought it because it said it would hold a cord of wood. NOT! It holds only about a half cord. I'm sure disappointed about that and now have to consider purchasing another one."
1,defective and the cover ripped to shreds,The metal had the screw holes punched about 4 inches lower on the one side. I had to drill new holes to put it together. This looks like a good deal until the cover gets cold and rips into 10 pieces. Do yourself a favor and get one with out the cover then buy a tarp or spend the money for a real cover
1,"If You Are Purchasing This Item Because of the Cover, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!","I purchased this item thinking it was the best they had to offer. Mainly, it was because this product offered a cover. Let me just say that although the rack itself was ok and I had no issue with it, the cover to this item is A PIECE OF CRAP! It ripped the first day we got it from the wind blowing. The purpose of this cover, is to cover wood outside. Clearly, it can NOT handle that. I expected this cover to hold up like my webber grill cover and had I known this cover was so cheap I NEVER would have purchased this item. If you are purchasing this item because of the cover, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Landmann Log Rack,"The price is excellent and it was very easy to set up. The cover doesn't seem to really go with the set as it doesn't particularly fit the frame or stay secured unless completely full of logs. After purchasing, within two days the cover's straps were torn due to its improper fit for accessibility and the fact that I only had it partially filled. The picture isn't exactly like you receive. Though, for the price (a lot less than others available) I would buy another in a heartbeat. It still does the job of holding logs off the ground just fine."
3,"Five-star rack, one-star cover","I ordered this rack/cover combo to place on my deck so that our firewood was more accessible during the winter months. As far as the rack goes, the quality meets my standards. There are probably better options out there, but it was easy to assemble, sits sturdily on my deck, and I didn't have any issues loading it to capacity.The cover, however, is another story. After loading the rack for the first time, I went to secure the cover and it ripped in two places (one along the top, one near a tie on the right side) and the wood poked through it it two other spots. That's going to make it a little tough to keep the wood dry.I suppose it's a case of ""you get what you pay for"" because I set out to get the best price I could on a rack and cover. If you're in this boat, too, do yourself a favor: buy the rack separately and spring for a better cover. You'll be glad you did."
2,Cover rips easy!,The racks work great but the cover is junk. They rip right out of the box; don't expect the covers to last any longer than 1 season.
4,Holds firewood. Does its job,Bought this as an addition to my 4 ft Landmann. Both are on a covered deck so I don't know how it would work exposed to the weather. For me it is perfect
3,Cover is not worth it!!!,"Recently purchased the log rack with cover. The rack is fine. The cover however is not well made and the ties are useless. Has been up less than 3 weeks and already have a several large tears in the cover. The rack by itself is a good deal but think twice before you purchase the rack with ""the fitted cover"". Your money would be better spent on a tarp and tie downs."
4,Good quality rack,"You will absolutely need to place this on a concrete slab or blocks. Don't go through the hassle of stacking your wood on this rack without this. It will sink into the ground, and it will spill the firewood onto the ground.Other than the minimal added expense of concrete blocks, I've been very happy with the rack. It took less than ten minutes to assemble, and I have been pleasantly surprised with how sturdy it actually is. The nuts and bolts were loose inside the box, but they were all accounted for, and went together very quickly."
3,OK for the Money,"For the money, the firewood holder is great. The cover is another story. There are a gazillion straps, which makes it quite confusing to attach. But, more importantly, our cover began to tear the 2nd time we tied it. It becomes almost plastic-bag consistency when it gets hot, which is what caused it to tear. But, again, the stand itself was easy to assemble and seems very sturdy so far."
2,The cover is doo-doo,"At the end of the day these things are pretty straight forward. There's not a lot of rocket science to them: Keep the firewood off the ground and covered from the elements. This passes on one and fails miserably on the other.It was a breeze to assemble and seems sturdy. It keeps the firewood off the ground. That's good.The cover they provide is a genuine piece of crap. There are four straps that secure the cover to the frame. Two of the four broke off as soon as I tied them down. I'm no hulk, either. The cover itself is about as thin as a baggie. It's cheap and useless. I don't see it protecting me from rain and snow for very long.Two stars because the cover is crap and I need to buy something more suitable."
3,Log rack,"I was very excited when I saw my husbands face when he opened the new log rack. It is a very sturdy rack and makes log stacking look very neat and compact on our porch. I am a bit disappointed with the cover however. One week after stacking the wood and covering the rack, we had a storm. The wing seemed to rip the cover very easily. I have had the covered rack for less than a month and already thinking about what to use to replace the torn cover.Otherwise, quite happy with rack. K.L."
3,Cover ripped at the first wind...you get what you pay for,"I received the package in good time. The store sent it in good packaging. It was not complicated to assemble. that being said, the product truly is a, ""you get what you pay for"" item. I am hoping it will last at least a couple of seasons, but the cover is worthless; looks good but keeps ripping. Put your money into a better product and get a separate cover.Honey Donegan"
4,"Sturdy, easy to put together","It took me about 15 minutes to put this together using just a screwdriver and a small adjustable wrench. I live in a harsh, seaside environment, but I expect to enjoy this for several years to come."
2,Good quality...but,"The rack is built well. But there estimate of holding nearly 1 cord of wood is far off the mark. It can't hold 1/2 cord. So if you have a cord sitting in your driveway, I would buy at least two."
4,Good rack for the price,The rack was easy to put together and appears sturdy. The cover is a throwaway. I ripped the cover right where it meets the strap (like many others). I had tied them loosely knowing that they were a failure point but still managed to tear the cover. I knew this would happen based on the other reviews so I can't say I was upset. Overall the rack is a good buy for the price but plan on having to purchase a separate cover.
4,Good product,"Good product, best price around, sturdy constuction, sides are higher than others I have seen or owned."
2,This Rack Doesn't Stack Up to The Wind,"When I viewed this rack on the web I thought maybe the 16g steel would be thick enough to hold 1/2 cord of wood upright during a PA winter. When the package arrived, I took one look at the un-open box and shipped it right back.Folks, let's get real here. If you're going to store a 1/2 cord of wood outside, during the winding winter months, heavy spring rains this product is not for you. If you are going to store a 1/2 cord of wood in the garage or near a wall, fence on a level floor that can block the wind from tipping this rack over, then buy this rack.The issue is balance, or should I say lack of balance.Needless to say, you get what you pay for. I decided to go with the 1/2 cord Woodhaven rack. For $200, I got piece of mind that I would not wake up one morning and find my stack logs tipped over.Life is too short."
2,"missing screws, poor cover",If you live in New England this may NOT be the rack for you. The cover is a thin vinyl or plastic material with ties. In snow and ice how can you expect anyone to struggle trying to untie it without ripping or you freezing!!? I ended up using bungie cords to keep the cover on. Some of the screws were missing to put it together.
2,Rack and cover,Simple construction. Little awkward to assemble. Don't get the cover with it. Piece of junk. Thin plastic ripps and extremaly brittle when cold.
3,Sturdy Rack Crappy Cover,I agree with the other comments on the poor quality of the cover. I wish I would have listened and not ordered this rack with the cover - it's not worth the extra money that's for sure. I am surprised that the cover is actually still offered seeing as most everyone is displeased with it. Mine didn't rip the very first day so I'm luckier than some on that. Mine last two whole days without a rip.
2,Quite Disappointed,"When ordering this I should have paid more attention to the difference between the two pictures that the company posted and then read more of the reviews. I missed the review that talked about the quality decreasing. I was expecting a nice cover with velcro and zippers, but got a cheep cover that just ties and started ripping the first time I put it on. I am just hoping the rack lasts a while but fearing it wont. Both pictures have the cover baring the company name but what came doesn't even have that!"
3,Plastic Cover Sucks Big-Time,"The rack itself is fine and does the job.The plastic cover, which is comprised of the thinnest, flimsiest, and most brittle plastic ever made, rips with greater ease than some brands of paper towel. This effect is magnified in cold weather. The company should be ashamed of producing such a piece of garbage."
2,"Does the job, barely","When I received this product, the steel tubes were already showing signs of rust. As other reviewers had pointed out, the cover is thin - well, you can say that again, it is a piece of junk. It ripped in the first 2 days, and it is in a protected area. It was as if the cold weather turned it into paper and it basically ripped in half. So, technically the rack is holding the wood I stacked on it, but that is about all it is good for. Definitely buy a proper cover if you need one."
4,"Solid & Good Sized Rack, Terrible Cover","Pros:- Ideal size (width, depth and height) for about 1/2 a cord- Solid construction- Easy assembly (very easy with two people)Cons:- Cover is brittle and cheap - smaller branches (kindling) can tear through it with ease- Cover tie straps tear away from the cover itselfSuggestions:- DO NOT BUY THE COVER- Place rack on concrete, asphalt or other solid surface to minimize chances of rust- If using on your lawn or dirt, place each leg on concrete slabs from Home Depot/Lowe's so it doesn't sink from all the weight- Oh, and DO NOT BUY THE COVER"
5,Great Value!,This is an awesome product and value. The shipper sent it very quickly and all the parts were wrapped very much with protective plastic. The box was in great shape. It makes for a very useful and exciting addition to the side of my garage and it's relatively simple to assemble.
2,Missing Parts,"The unit arrived very fast, but was missing three small parts. I am waiting to hear back from Amazon concerning the parts. I believe you can find a better unit for $40.00."
1,Cover is useless,"The cover tears if you look at it too hard. The ties break at the slightest stress. The rack is not bad, but the cover is worst than a cheap shower curtain."
3,Nice rack...but the cover is TRASH,"The storage part of this unit is great; sturdy and easy to put together. The fitted cover, however, is garbage. It ripped and tore in several spots just attempting to put it over the unit. Then the first sign of windy weather did the cover in completely--shredded it to pieces. Do yourself a favor and skip the rack+cover combo and just get the rack."
2,Problems with zipper,"The fabric works well at protecting wood from moisture. However, one of the three zippers broke after three uses. The zipper pull simply came off, leaving the closed zipper in place without any way of opening. Unfortunate because otherwise it's a great product."
2,Things have changed,"I ordered two of these racks about two months ago. They were pretty nice with the Landman logo screened on the end rails and on the cover. The rails were a nice quality black finish. This prompted me to order two more and took delivery on them about three weeks ago. Totally different rack. The bottom rails were rusting through the incredibly thin, flat finish, no logo on the rails or the covers. The covers were a poorer grade than the first two I received to the point that one of them ripped up the side while covering the rack, using no force whatsoever. You can tell the difference in the materials just buy looking and feeling them. I would have said to buy these two months ago but now I say to buy American. These are not worth the money any longer."
4,Solid firewood rack,The firewood rack was easy to assemble and holds about 1/2 a face cord. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the rack could use some sort of support connecting each side. It feels solid but the weight of the wood (I loaded it up) seems to make the ends slightly bow.
2,Don't Buy Fitted Cover,Rack is fine. Same as one I bought in the early 1980's and still in use. Fitted cover is made of the cheapest material possible and shredded in 2 to 3 days.
5,landman 8 foot firewood log rack,GREAT PRODUCT. EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. VERY STURDY AND STABLE IF PLACED ON HARD FLAT SURFACE LIKE DECK OR CONCRETE. WORKS AS DESCRIBED. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO OTHERS LOOKING FOR SIMILAR PRODUCT. GREAT PRICE. FREE SHIPPING AND NO TAX!!!
4,Good rack at a reasonable price,"Good rack that's relatively easy to put together. Keeps wood high and dry. Not suitable for soft soil, but works fine on pavement."
5,I'm 69 years old and I put this together myself.,It is the same product that is out there that costs 3 times as much. It is strong and good quality. The fact that it comes with the cover makes it a better bargain.
1,Rack is fine/Cover is terrible,"The cover is an absolute joke. I cannot believe that this company has any quality standards whatsoever. I purchased this because it had a cover. I went to tie it to the rack and it ripped, like tissue paper. Then it ripped again. Then the wind hit it and it shredded. I am still amazed that this thing got past any quality control."
1,Misrepresented Product,"Bought adjustable firewook rack from Landmann USA 82424. It was described as 4 foot high and in the picturers on line shows one continuous pipe, when the rack arrived it had two pieces for both ends with bolts to hold them together. The picture on line and on the box are misleading to the quality that I was looking for. PLEASE DO NOT USE PICTURES THAT MISREPRESENTED YOUR PRODUCT!Mike"
4,Logs where to put them,Firewood rank is great you can chose the size you want - i love its narrow enough to fit in a garage with out taking up extra room
4,Perfect for 1/2 cord of wood,"I used 4 2x4 8' pressure treated. I overlapped them about 12 inches and used 3"" galvanized screws. I also cut 3 cross braces from another 2x4. 2 on the ends and one in the middle.Each 'end' comes in two pieces with nuts and bolts to put them together. Worked fine.The only thing that was missing is screws to attach the metal braces to the wood. I used galvanized nails that I already had.Building the rack like this was the perfect size for 1/2 cord of cut wood."
3,"Decent rack, bad cover","The rack goes together very quickly with a #3 phillips screwdriver and an adjustable wrench, and feels fairly sturdy once all together. I put each pair of feet on a short piece of treated 2x4 to keep the feet from sinking into the ground and rusting. It holds 1/3 cord of split firewood and has very little wobble once loaded up.The cover is junk. As soon as it gets cold, the cover starts to crack and tear wherever it's moved. I'd save the few extra bucks and get the version with no cover, and pick up a standard poly tarp if you need a cover."
3,"The rack's fine, just don't get it with the cover.","The rack itself is solid. Easy to put together and sturdy. Holds my firewood with no issues. However, if you are thinking of buying the rack/cover combo, don't.I have garbage bags that are more durable. The cover shredded before I could place it completely on the rack. The ties just facilitated the shredding process.Just go for the rack, the cover is not worth the packaging. I purchased a plastic tarp from OSH that has more durability. Very disappointed in that cover."
4,"Pearson Is Brilliant, But....","T.R. Pearson employs the language as well as anyone writing today, and uses it for breathtakingly funny satire. Unlike writers who are supposedly funny but are not at all -- yes, I mean Carl Hiaasen -- Pearson will have you gasping from laughter. Don't read this book in public places unless you want to garner funny looks.On the other hand, Pearson's world is easily broken down into three kinds of people: The losers who know they are losers, the losers who do not know they are losers, and the evil. Talk about depressing.You've been warned."
3,So-So,"I've read Sandra Hill and other authors Viking stories and been quite happy with them but this book was never more than just okay. Kelda, the adopted daughter of a Viking Chief sails to find his half Iriqois son who he wishes to take over as chief when he dies. The problem is when Kelda and her men arrive, they are treated as prisoners and she finds out the chief's son Brander wants nothing to do with the Vikings. When she finds a way to bring Brander and his mother to the Viking camp, it is for Brander to discover that another man is bethrothed to Kelda and is being groomed to take over when the leader dies.I think my biggest problem with this book is the way the dialoge reads, you viking, I am a great Iriqois, etc....Its predictable and sometimes a little silly but not boring."
4,Sometimes a bomb is not enough...,"...To express the way I feelAnd an explosion in the darkWon't let you down...Good stuff here, I daresay better than on the major-label album these tracks are outtakes from (""Jewels for Sophia""). Released on Robyn's own label, Editions PAF!, this CD features ""Daisy Bomb,"" ""I Saw Nick Drake,"" and ""1974."" Other tracks include""Adoration Of The City,"" ""I Wish I Liked You,"" ""Nietzsche's Way,"" ""The Philosopher's Stone,"" ""The Green Boy,"" ""Judas Sings (Jesus & Me),"" ""Antwoman"" (dub version), ""I Used To Love You,"" and ""The Underneath.""Worth it for the first three mentioned tracks alone. ""Daisy Bomb"" is one of the most deceptively simple love songs I've ever had the pleasure to hear."
5,Great addition to kitchen tools,"This is the second one I've ordered. My daughter saw mine and asked me to get one for her. The bowl is unusually deep and really comes in handy. I was ricing some potatoes, and placed the ricer over the top of the bowl. The potatoes could fall into the deep bowl, leaving room for the next batch. With the usual height of bowls, I would have had to hold the ricer above the bowl, or the bottom of the ricer would have touched the other riced potatoes.The strainer fits perfectly over the top of the bowl, and I've used it when washing berries.I haven't used the grater yet, but I can see how it will be perfect for grating right into the bowl. The grater has a choice of grating sizes. And the cutting board can be used on or off the bowl. It has an open side for scraping the cut food right into the bowl.Everything is very high quality, with a porcelain bowl and stainless steel strainer and grater.This is a very good buy."
4,Mygrafew,"The pain from my migraines are usually off the charts and will last anywhere from 3 to 5 days. I used Mygrafew almost every day for a month and still got a migraine around the time of my month. However, it only lasted a day and the pain wasn't half as severe as it usually is. So, all and all I do believe this stuff does work pretty well. It was a relief to only have a migraine for a day and the pain not as acute. I will definitely continue to use this!"
1,Didn't Help my Migraines,"Dr. Oz recommended this for migraines, so I bought a bottle. It didn't help mine, but it led me to an online forum where I foundFormula 303 45 Count, which helps stave off migraines if I can take it early enough and get some rest. Still no natural cure for my actual migraines, though--I'm still on the hunt for one!"
3,Who knows....?,"I have used this for two weeks now. So far I don't notice anything so hard to tell. Like so many supplements or natural remeides, maybe it doesn't really do anything."
3,Don't get the pre-tuned models!,"These Remo Tubanos are just the thing for young or beginnng students. They are fairly durable and very easy to play. The feet are the best part. You don't need to hold or tip them to hear a good bass sound. I highly recommend you get the tunable models, NOT the pre-tuned ones. It's worth the extra cost. The pre-tuned drums get lower and lower sounding and there is no way to tune them back up. Also the heads can pull off if lifted by the rim and that's how kids will naturally move them."
5,Wonderful Read,"This is an excellent book. Very good story, written in a gripping style, and hard to put down. The action builds and builds, but what I really like about Neon Streets is it is about something. Strong themes, and it made me think."
5,Gospel Truth is great jazz and inspiration !,"I was able to sit down and really listen to this cd and it was astounding. It takes the older hymns of the faith and puts them in a new dimension that makes my soul kind of soar. It is hard to explain, but in a very subtle way just listening lifted me up like never before. I hope Patti does more material because I will get it for sure."
2,The Plain People,"This book was not a reading that just couldn't be put down, however, I thought Phobe made some bad and good decisions."
3,Patchwork a story of the plain people,Patchwork a story of the plain people is a good read. I love to read about the Amish life .and it's a free book.
3,"Patchwork a story of ""The plain people""","never really got into might try again later it just did not ""speak"" to me and could not get into the story frame"
3,"Patchwork, A Story of the Plain People","A very slow start - I wanted to give up but I kept on reading. Many pages later it got better. Not one of my recommendations for those who like to enjoy a story in the very beginning. But, everyone's interest is different - give it a try."
2,Boring!!,"Its like a childrens story. Not much plot, details, or entertainment. But it was free...so there ya go I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Slow Start,"This book is starting slow, but I may go back and read it when I finish others. It's worth keeping around for a while."
3,Patchwork,This book was just ok to me. A short story! I like stories that go on for awhile & this book really didn't do that. With that said I guess it was informative about how their quilts come to be.
5,What a book,"What a book, I could hardly put it down. The descriptive wording made you feel like you were there. The love story was not so overpowering but gentle and sweet."
3,PATCHWORK A STORY OF THE PLAIN PEOPLE,"I have read many Amish stories by authors who were formerly plain or one of their parents were. This story did not seen as ""real"" as those stories, even though all are fiction."
3,Patchwork,This book was ok. Doesn't really go into a lot of detail with the characters like other Amish writers do. I like more plot and substance in a book. It was rather short and fairly predictable.
5,Gorgeos eternity pendant,"When I saw it I like it a lot I hoped that looks same as the picture. Have to admit that it's really gorgeous. If you want to have a nice jewelery pendant it's the right one. Seems all cz are diamonds so shiny. I hope only not to tarnish, because it's not rhodium plated.To avoid this I could advise to take off it when took a shower or put a perfume and body cream."
5,Good product!,"Received earlier than expected, was a good fit. Take your time with the installation and you will not have any problems."
2,Nothing wrong with product,"Ordered vent shade for a 2006 Lincoln Zephyr, and the one sent was for a Toyota Camry. Amazon was right on it and picked up incorrect item, and sent me another of the same thing. Ordered same brand elsewhere, and fit great!"
3,not hiz best but still good,"this cd aint that bad, but its jus not his greatest, only pick this up if you like tha older stuff, its not very wicket either"
5,Best Tanning Product,"I have tried many different tanning lotions, but this one is my favorite. The tanning salon stores sell this same product for 3-4times this price. This product is priced very fair and the delivery is fast. I will keep buying this product from this seller for as long as they sell it!"
5,WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST,"I shouldn't have to convince anyone of the musical genius that is Van Halen. The music on this CD will stand the test of time, and will never lose it's value to those who appreciate rock.If you don't have this, you should. You will have made a wise choice.Feel good about that."
3,The weakest link,"From the classic Van Halen albums, this is the least satisfying. Lots of blues based songs, some fans consider it their 'blues' album, I dont think the songwritting is very good overall. Apart from 'and the cradle will rock' not other song is really outstanding. Eddie is not famous either for being a strong blues player, I dont think there are as many good solos here as in other records. If you are a Van Halen fan, you need to have the full 'six pack', just make this your last purchase after you have gotten the other five albums."
3,Not Up To Their Standards,"This is not a bad recording in anyway. However, when compared to their first two releases, Diver Down, 5150, or the Ultiamte Fair Warning, the product falls short of standard. First of all, there are only eight real tracks. I'm sorry that tape loop sound effect Tora Tora Tora does not qualify as anything. Gosh, I hate when bands do that. Other than some speedy guitar solos, Loss Of Control does not add anything special. Everybody Wants Some almost fits the same mold but the guitar work is somewhat creative. As a matter of fact, its Eddie's guitar that carries this record as a whole. David Lee Roth contributes some gem like vocal deliveries particularly on Take Your Whiskey Home, Could This Be Magic, and the riveting Romeo's Delight. The other material is good in spots but when blended together just does not distinguish itself as often as it should. Not an obligatory Van Halen purchase."
3,Everybody Wants Some---~I WANT SOME TOO AH!,Van Halen- Women And Children First (MP3 Version)Moods:-Encouraging-Nostalgic-Inferior/Bad-mouthing-Unrestrained (-)-Addicted-Failing Love-Picturesque-Helpful/importantProduction Quality: ***1/2
5,Heavy Metal Van Halen,"Van Halen's third album,WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST,is the heaviest they have ever been;this album has attitude and a great sense of humor running through it.These boys are having fun;just listen to Dave scat singing on FOOLS,and the acoustic fooling around on COULD THIS BE MAGIC. Guys,haven't we all been in situations like those presented on TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME and IN A SIMPLE RHYME?EVERYBODY WANTS SOME ended up on the soundtrack to BETTER OFF DEAD.Harmonies clash with guitar as per usual.Essential VH purchase."
5,Could this be magic????????,"Put this back-to-back with their first and you have two compelling reasons why Van Halen was, once upon a time, THE capo tutti capo of heavy. Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony were the rhythm section supreme on this platter, and songs like ""Everybody Wants Some,"" ""Romeo Delight"" and ""Fools"" feature Eddie VH pulling out riffs that other guitarists only dream of. But you also have ace softer stuff like ""Could This Be Magic?"" and ""In a Simple Rhyme"" where Roth's horsing around is cheery witout being grating and, once again, Mr. Ed shines. The last unqualified primo Van Halen album; it pretty quickly got down to great, good, ho-hum and godawful with each suceeding effort"
4,The Most Interesting Dave-Era Album,"I think that this is the coolest VH album of the Roth-years. They seem to go off slightly in a different direction on this effort. It seems to be a darker, but in a good way, it is by no means a depressing effort. ""Everybody Wants Some"" is a killer cut with the tribal drumming and the dark and heavy riffing. The album-rock hit ""And The Cradle Will Rock"" is one of their all-time best cuts. My favorite overall from this album is ""Take Your Whiskey Home"" with its slightly funky riff and that very cool Michael Anthony bass line (Rum-Bum-Duma-Duma-Bum-Bum) that plays under Eddie's solos. ""Fools"" and ""Tora Tora"" also shine. Don't leave this one out of your VH collection !"
4,Van Halen does it again !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"With songs like Fools, In A Simple Rhyme, and Rome Delight, it's no wonder I keep coming back for more !!!!!!!!!!"
5,van halen rocks again,"this is another classic vh album which has great guitar playing and dave doing his mumbling,""have you seen juniors grades"" he just makes this album fun to listen too. i heard that dave never had full lyrics for the song so he just decided to add some low talking more or less, anyway its just awesome to hear these guys on this album. the guitar on fools blew everyone away in 1980. craddle will rock is a killer tune, then they follow that up by everybody wants some, a great party tune, fools also kicks ass, romeo delight is one of my favorite vh tunes of all time, loss of control is a little different but is good as well, take your whiskey home is another one of my favorite vh tunes, could this be magic is cool and catchy, in a symle ryhme is good too. another one of the best van halen albums of all time. hope you enjoyed my review."
3,70s + 80s Meet,"While the 1st Van Halen record will always be my favorite, I did enjoy ""Women And Children First."" While VH 1 has more of an 80s sound to it, VH 2 has a 70s sound. ""Women and Children First"" seems to have a little of each.""And the Cradle Will Rock"" is a decent opener. 'Everybody Wants Some' is one of the most 80s sounding songs on the record. 'Fools' was strange, but interesting. 'Tora Tora' was unusual, but still good. 'Loss of Control' has kind of a strange sound, but it is good. 'Take Your Whiskey Home' is notably softer, but it has a great 70s charm. (Some would probably say 60s.) While also on the gentler side, 'Could This Be Magic' cleverly inserts the title of this 3rd record. In some ways, 'Could This Be Magic' steals the record. 'In a Simple Rhyme' is a bit anti climactic, but still good. Overall, it's a good record."
2,Worst Roth-era disc...,"By far. Can't beleive all of the glowing reviews for this one. Well, i guess thats what this page can do sometimes. Just a lousey, confused effort in my book. Love VH too, favorite band of all time, but just could never warm up to WACF. ""CRADLE"" and ""EVERYBOY WANTS..."" are decent VH staples and fine in their own right, but the REST! Much of the material on this album sounds like B-side and outtakes! ""LOSS OF CONTROL"" ""COULD THIS BE MAGIC"" AND ""TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME"" are just failed experiments. WACF is just a weak, limp-wristed transistional album for the band. It still gets two stars because this is atleast better then III and much of the dreck put out under VAN HAGAR.Here is the 3 best VH albums;(1) ""Fair Warning""(2) ""VH 1""(3) ""Diver Down"" (the most underrated VH album)Here are the 3 worst;(1) ""OU812""(2) ""Women and Children First""(3) ""VH III (everyone loves to bash this monstosity)"""
4,"Nice toy, not for infants","I bought this lion for my 1-year-old and she loves it, but there is a problem. The hair in the lion's mane pulls out very easily, which immediately becomes a source of great entertainment and ""food"".Because of this, little ones should be closely supervised when playing with this toy. In the manufacturer indicates that this is for ages 3 and up and they're right."
5,Lord Titan the lion of lions.,"Lord Titan is a beautiful, exqusitely made plush toy. The detailing is excellent and the plush is of superior qualitty. He makes a very cuddly toy to snuggle up with. Because of his size he gives a sleepy child a real senseof security.Linda Switzer, BC Canada"
2,Disappointed,I was expecting something a bit more sturdy.I should have researched it better.It is NOT FINE toothed as the description states.It does not do the job expected on my cat and was a waste of money.
5,Inspiration comes from within & not an object,"When Emma was born as a baby gift she was given a plain creme colored rug that her Mother put by her crib. As Emma grew she began to draw beautiful pictures and won many awards. Emma got her inspiration and what to draw from her rug. One day while at school, her mother finds her rug while she was in Emma's room and found the rug was dirty and washed it. When Emma came home and found her rug missing she was upset, and even more upset after the rug came out of the dryer, smaller, clean and not fluffy. Emma's insipartion for her drawings was no longer there..... and finally one day after throwing all of her artwork, awards and supplies in the trash as well the rug.....she finally again sees and feels "" her Inspiration"" and realizes that creativity come from within, not from an object.This is my 1st Allen Say book, and I really am impressed! Here's to more great books."
5,K & N Buell air filter,It fits perfectly and was easy to install. What I really bought it for was I love my Ulysses and with the lifetime reuseable filter I should be able to ride forever.
4,The God of Mischief,It was the follow up of the first book and it is more for younger people. It was a fun book though about the two young children and their curiosity about the people around them and how their curiosity got them into trouble several times. A nice story.
2,Don't bother,My standard battery lasted longer than this one. Plus it's bulky and the cover won't stay on. The picture is deceptive. Makes a big phone bigger.
4,Ezekiel Honig - Scattered Practices,"SCATTERED PRACTICES sees Ezekiel Honig going much more minimalist and electronic in his compositions. There's less warmth here than on his previous works, and the tracks run together, forming a larger picture, rather than discrete moments. The ""Going Sailing Refrain"" triptych, for instance, has a bit of musique concrete to it without a traditional melody. ""Books on Tape"" is similarly spare, with a throbbing beat, 2 or 3 chords, and a modified vocal sample. But that's not to say that the album is completely devoid of warmth: ""Homemade Debris"" is bathed in it, with a moderate 4/4 beat to ground the gentle synth washes, until it floats out on a pure ambient note. ""Concrete & Plastic,"" as well, glides on its suspended tones, whlie ""Fractures & Fissures (Part 1)"" seems to take a note out of Tim Hecker's notebook. ""Edit Edit Edit"" closes the album with a quiet grace. Quite nice overall."
4,An enjoyable book,"I think how you feel about the book depends on what kind of stories you like to read. If you enjoy historical-fiction and romance then it is a good book, if you don't enjoy that, you probably won't want to read this book. I think the author tied together the history of the war time and the love story very well. It gives the reader a look in to Bekah and Scott's lives from two different views. Not only does is it a story about their love and what they have to overcome to be together but also about how they lived their normal lives during that period of time. I enjoy both historical-fiction and romance so I found the book very good and enjoyable to read."
5,Great!,"This book is really a great book. I have read 5 of the 6 books in the collection (Hindenburg,1937/San Francisco Earthquake, 1906/The Great Chicago Fire,1871/Washington Avalanche, 1910/ Pearl Harbor,1941) Now I can't wait to read Louisianna Hurricane, 1860. I bought both of the latest Pearl Harbor & Louisianna Hurricane & I finished Pearl Harbor in less than 24 hours... I couldn't put it down!"
1,Does not last. As I expected,"I bought this about a year ago. Looking at it I quickly realized that this was not ""my Dad's broadcast spreader"". It is almost 100% plastic. Looks cheap and is cheap. But the end of one season, and having used it for only 4-5 times on my average to small size lawn, the wheels began to lock up. So when I went out to drop my first load of fertilizer this season, it totally broke. The axle and rotating spreader completely broke. I have contacted Scott's and they say they will reimburse. I would recommend a more sturdy brand, Good luck."
2,Only lasted 1.5 seasons,"Spreader worked okay. However, broke beyond repair after 1.5 seasons of use. The metal frame bent when pushing it across my lawn."
3,Cute set.,"My 2 year old daughter received this for Christmas. The arm/knee pads fit her fine, but the helmet is too big. My 5 year old can wear it. Not sure yet if the additional pads will make a difference in the size. I would recommend taking a child to the store to try a helmet on since fit is very important. Otherwise, it is a nice set."
4,great helmet,I bought this for my newly 2 year old to ride her scooter with. She is very petite and the helmet didn't fit her at all. My other daughter is 3 and it fit her a little loosely. That was fixed by the extra pads provided. It is definitely not for children under 3 unless they are bigger than average.
2,"Dunderdeck -- Not What I Remember, But Great to Have the Lyrics","I've been searching high and low for a re-issue of Tom Glazer's ""On Top of Spaghetti"", which was purchased for me on vinyl sometime around 1964 and, lo these many years later, is still my all-time favorite kids' album.When I saw that Dunderdeck was featured on this CD, I had to check it out. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold a candle to Glazer's version.The best I can say about this CD is that it goes refresh my memory of all the gross-out songs we loved as kids. In this ever-so-PC, Raffi-infested world, that alone is refreshing."
2,"Misleading dimensions. Much too small, didn't grow.","I added this to my wish list even after seeing all the other reviews that said it was too small. I checked the dimensions given, 8"" x 4.2"" x 8 and figured it was a good size.I received it for Christmas.Turns out that those are the dimensions for the plastic packaging, which they refer to as a ""sprouting greenhouse""The ACTUAL dimension are roughly 6"" x 2"" x 3"".There is absolutely no room for ""Moon rocks"" or the ""crater dust"" provided.Worst of all nothing ever grew!"
3,Semi-Believable Near Future Cloak and Dagger,"HAVOC is a moderately-paced, semi-believable spy story, set about 10 years in the future. A future where Nanotechnology-based weapons are commonplace, and where AI computer programs are as tricky and diabolical as humans.The main character in the story is an ex-CIA agent in his late-40's, who has had his identity changed and is starting to enjoy his retirement on a Latin America beach... but, he is brought out of retirement to help pursue another CIA agent who has evidently ""gone bad""... much intrigue, chases, and shoot-em-ups follow over the course of the 400 page book.HAVOC suffers from a number of mistakes... most notable are the technical mistakes - for example, the author states that GPS satellites are in Geosynchronous orbit, but they are in Medium Earth Orbit. Another annoying mistake is that the Nuclear Plant in Temelin, CZ appears misspelled as Telemin in the Chapter headings - but spelled properly in the Chapter text."
3,Male geekdom testosterone action/spy thriller fantasy,"I don't know the work by author R. J. Pineiro, but he seems preoccupied with combining sexy female spies, males preoccupied with sex and sexual banter, and cyberterror.That about wraps up the book, Havoc.I have to admit that the story plot did keep my interest until the end. The traitors were too bumbling, and the bad guys too easy to take down, but some of the technology was nifty, and, as I stated before, I kept wanting to know how things were going to end.Remember that old cliche about geeks being preoccupied with having sex... with another person? The author kept reminding me with his characters and their conversations."
3,Just OK,"Main plot was interesting. But other subplots diluted it. Too much going on. I got annoyed by his description of personal body parts, and the use of ""cat"" when referring to other characters. I thought the cyber helmet was ridiculous. Finally, the editing was poor."
4,It's an oil filter,"It was the about the same price as I could buy it at Wal-mart, but they sent it to the house - One less trip in the car"
1,Not one note of music,"The author states: ""I am very conscious that in presenting the words of hymns without the tunes that are their essential accompaniments, this book does not do full justice to its subject."" I agree. Mr. Bennett goes on to encourage readers to sing the melodies as they remember them, or failing that, to make something up! How sad."
2,Not for the do-it-yourselfer,"I found this book very frustrating. It teaches you how to use Access by the use of Wizards and full color graphics but for someone like me, who is a do-it-yourselfer, it is very limited in explaining the procedures from the ground up in design view. I found Access' own help more helpful."
2,Sanremo is not italian pop,"Sanremo don t rapresent the bestitalian pop like before,now is just a bussines show and the best italian pop artist are other"
2,Pretty good until . . .,"This book was pretty good--fast paced, suspenseful, romantic--until the author lapsed into purple prose and contrived conflict. I never really saw a valid reason for the heroine's animosity toward the hero. All the internal and external man-bashing--typical of the Karen Robards novels I've read so far (only 2 to date) makes me cringe. I felt so sorry for this hero. If a woman begged a man to make love to her and then so brutally rejected him afterwards, he'd likely devastated. And why? Because *she* refused to take responsibility for her part in it! Not the mark of true womanhood or heroism, imo. But I suspect this is an old novel (1980s?) pandering to the editors' calls for angry conflict instead of story conflict. Sigh. Well, I'll read one of her later ones, but if she hasn't evolved with the times, then it'll be my last Karen Robards novel."
3,PRETTY GOOD STORY,"This was mildly entertaining. The hero was a little hard to like but eventually he grew on you. All in all though, it was hard to care a whole lot for either of the main characters. Not a keeper."
5,very good,always enjoy Karen Robards books look for them often. her writings are very entertaining even the macho maleswould recommend to friends
2,not consistent,"At first I was very pleased with this type of product. I used it professionally in my cabinet shop with great results. But just as often as there was good there was bad. I had 15 gallons of the stuff that might has well have been milk, since it wouldn't stick. I don't know why and the sales reps had no answers. Maybe bad batches?? Needs to work every time if I am to buy any more though!"
1,This Product Cost Me Time And Money!!!! It Is Useless!,"MINUS 5 STARS!!!! This has to be the worst excuse for Contact Cement I have ever seen. Exactly two hours later, I'm still waiting for this lousy product to dry--even with the use of a hair dryer...TWICE! It sticks to everything except itself. I have a project requiring the cementing of foam pieces to a traveling storage container. The stuff doesn't work. Period! I am very experienced in the use of contact cement, and this product is useless. I'm furious! I'm guessing it's because it is water based. Please, somebody, give me the real thing! I do believe that this product will be the center of a class action lawsuit. It is worse than bad. I rarely write reviews, but everyone--especially the management at DAP--should be aware that a product is being sold to the innocent public that just flat DOES NOT WORK."
1,"garbage, absolute garbage",followed the directions perfectly three different times and three different times the stuff would not stick. and then i would have to clean up the gunk it leaves and use the real contact cement.i cannot believe that DAP would actually sell this stuff. i complained to DAP and they suggested i get a refund--i suggest they take this product off the market.
1,Terrible!!!!!,"This junk is terrible!!, could not have been ever tested before production, because it does not work.When you do what the instructions on the can says, and try to stick them together the pieces do not stick at all. (My banding fell on the floor)I found you must put one coat on, let it dry, put on the second coat and before it dries put the pieces together,weight it down and tape the seams and keep rolling every few minutes, then it will stick partially.DO NOT BUY THIS GLUE!!!!!!!!!Would not have given any stars, doesn't deserve any at all!!Get the original"
1,This stuff is crap,Trying to glue Laminate to MDF for table top. This crap will not stick. Waste of money. Wish I knew what would take it off...
1,ITEM CAME BROKEN,"This item leaked in the box and wound up getting all over the box and now I have no contact cement at all. Amazon will not take it back so now I'm out $25.I usually like Amazon, but NEVER ORDER THIS ITEM FROM THEM!!!!!!"
5,LOW VOC is the key,"Great product if you have the patience to allow it to dry. Any product out there that is less harmful to your brain cells than the other standard products deserves 5 stars. I use it to bond rubber to wood and once it dries, it's good to go. But by all means, if you don't care about your health or the environment go with the more toxic stuff."
5,Great stuff,"Unlike the other reviewer, I actually used the product. This is terrific stuff. Easy to apply, cures quickly, holds well. Best of all, there's no hideous odor like the old-fashioned contact cement and no VOC, so you can use it without a mask and/or in the house. Turns from white to clear when ready for assembly, in about 30-40 minutes. But you can wait as long as two hours and you can ""reactivate"" it with a little more cement if you slip outside that timeframe. Cleans up easily, if you get it on your hands, a little rubbing and it comes right off."
5,"Outstanding, Creative, Fun","This is a great, lighthearted cd to have on during Christmastime. Meli-kaliki-maka is probably the best song. Outstanding musicians with accordions and steel guitars. Grab some egg nog or hot cocoa with family and friends and enjoy this cd."
4,"Encyclopedia of Rocks and Minerals, a Review","I am the author of two books, ""Collecting Fluorescent Minerals"" and ""The World of Fluorescent Minerals"" and needed additional resources for non-fluorescent minerals. This book was nicely done - good illustrations, lots of variety, clearly written - but the information covering fluorescent minerals in this book was not very accurate. Every mineral collector needs several sources to get a good idea of what he or she has and this is one that I will continue to use. This should not be your only book, but it is worth having among your library."
1,Not worth buying.,"This is a die cast part and not strong. I was using them for deck stair layout. When tightening the thumb screw by hand the Stair Gauge snapped in half at the slot. The exposed metal was that grainy, dry look of what is generically referred to as pop-metal which is exactly what this did. In addition, the thumb screw end is not deburred and has the rough edge of the rolled threads. I cleaned this up on the strip sander when I bought them. I replaced these gauges with the Swanson SG0020 Solid Brass Stair Gauges. They're made from brass hexagon stock, machined on a lathe and also with a slot cutter. The thumb screws are machined with smooth ends so not to damage your square. There are many choices which are much better than the Adjustable Clamp 2Pc Adjustable Square Gauge 9249."
2,made in china,"picture shows made in usa, but the one I received is made in china they should up date the picture"
1,not good,I loved Die Mommy Die and assumed any Charles Busch film would be good. I be wrong. This is not a comedy and is dreadful.
5,The local rock group down the street is trying hard to learn their song.,"This was a compilation of Monkees songs released in 1986. It is a well chosen collection of some of their best songs. There were also three new songs recorded for the CD. ""That Was Then, This is Now"" actually became their comeback hit, as well as their last hit. If you can find a cheap used copy of this CD, it's worth getting."
1,Revisionism,"I purchased this book from a big bookstore, lost my receipt and am unable to return it. This book uses historical revision to undermine the ""just cause"" of the Armenian Genocide. It makes faulty assumptions and loose links between terrorism and the Armenian American activists who until this day ask for recognition of the Armenian Genocide."
2,dull,Very slow and I suppose clear. Hamlet may be depressed and indecisive but this seems just hollow. I know the participants are all terrific. Actors and director. But it seems rigid and correct. Dull.
4,eh good,"Since this is the only to right my review i bought my computer from bestbuy and it came with a bungle( nvidia geforce 7800 GT 256,Logitech G15 keyboard,Logitech mx518 mouse,and logitech speakers 5.1)and was cool for a while but i did love the keyboard and also had this computer for 10 months in planing to buy a new motherboard,new processer,and DDR2 1gb ram for windows vista and stuff but over the stuff i got it great and i know half about computers (still learning)so i give this computer a 4 star rateing. :)"
5,More rock than you can shake a stick at,"Fantastic! As a former (lifelong) Southerner, I was delighted by ""Southern Rock Opera"". While the music, dense as a curtain of kudzu, is solid, straightforward rock, the lyrics are what make this a truly exemplary album. The issue of prejudice functions as a recurrent theme throughout the piece, and, in the words of ""The Three Great Alabama Icons"", 'it ain't just white and black'. The singer's razorwire/whiskeysoured voice slices through George Wallace's Machiavellian desire for power; the relationship between Skynyrd and Neil Young; and the many misconceptions held about the South by both Southerners and... well, the rest of you that ain't.For years, I was ashamed to claim my Southern ancestry, fearing that people would think of me as some negative stereotype rather than a smart gal with a drawl. Now, even with all of ""the dualities of the Southern thing"", I hold my head high and sing the praises of the Drive-By Truckers, and of the land I once called home."
5,Great Southern Rock album,"This album, and band, reminds me very much of Neil Young, back in the early days, with Crazy Horse. Great lyrics sung over various types of music, ranging from country to hard rock. They can sound sound pretty jagged at times, but that's fine with me. Nobody else out there is doing this now. Check this one out, along with ""The Dirty South"" and ""Decoration Day"". Their DVD ""live at the 40 Watt Club"" is excellent as well. The folks writing the bad reviews just don't get it."
2,Skip It,"A band that tries to revive a musical style from the 1970's is going to struggle to bring it into modern times for the sake of reaching popular status. Well, this album does not achieve that status. One thing the album does do well is tell the story of Lynyrd Skynyrd. What the album doesn't do well is being pleasing to the ear and easy to listen to. I don't recommend this album unless you really want to hear it. Besides all that, the CD case is a cardboard case without plastic CD holders, very cheap looking. All in all, the entire production of the album seems very low-key and not well thought out."
4,Best Album Title Ever,I haven't listened to this as much as I'd lke to but on concept alone it's the album of the year
3,Not my favorite,"I love DBT!! That being said, this disc marks a turn in direction for the band, and the turn ain't too smooth. There are some gems here- check out ""Dead Drunk and Naked""-- classic Patterson Hood. But overall, I feel the song writing is sub par, and frankly, disc 2 is just poor.Personally, I would pick up the other 5 cd's prior to this one. If you really love the band after that, you might wanna try to find this one on the cheap somewhere."
3,It's a southern thang.,"I must say that I never cared about ""Lynyrd Skynyrd"" much, but I saw this compared to other things I did like, and gave it a shot. Overall I'd say it's pretty good. They definitely walk that line between classic southern rock, and some of the recent alt-country bands, and I can see how ""Southern Rock Opera"" could please either crowd. There's a few slower/speaking parts that drag this down some, but tracks like ""72 (this highway's mean)"" and ""Guitar Man Upstairs"" rock along well. ""Ronnie And Neil"" is really good, and actually sounds like ""Crazy Horse"" to my ears, which may be the point. Not every song amazes, and I wonder if this wouldn't have been a better 15 track single disc, but oh well. So even though this is a decent album, I think when the mood strikes, I'll reach for ""My Morning Jacket"" instead."
2,Great idea but no songs,"I have to agree with Anthony from Brownsville. I am a huge Skynyrd fan and really wanted to like this album. I remember everything from those times in the 70s. Anyway, the concept is great, the lyrics are actually well done, but the songs are totally unmemorable.As the Who have proven, rock operas that stand the test of time have songs that can stand on their own. Unfortunately, they aren't here."
2,Blinded by the Hype,"I bought this double album after reading several glowing reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't available on a listening station. I recommend that you listen before buying because the vocals on this album are annoyingly awful. The idea is good; however, this band doesn't translate the idea into good music. I find some of the songs ok, but most are blandly produced with the main flaw being the vocals which sound like someone who lost their voice but decided to keep singing. Why do critics keep hyping cds that simply can not live up to the glowing reviews that are so readily handed out to dull albums? It seems that everyone is so bored with today's music that they will settle for anything that isn't teen pop."
2,Ain't no Lynyrd Skynyrd,"I was expecting great things from this album based on all of the positive reviews. I haven't heard any really good southern rock in a long time - and still haven't.The positive: Great Concept, Superb Lyrics, great artwork.But, from a great southern band I expect some memorable tunes, this album has none.I expect great lead guitar work - the guitar work on this is tentative, sophmoric, unimaginative and technically weak.I expect some memorable riffs - none.The vocals are decent, but the vocal characteristics of the lead singers are so different, that no harmonies are possible.There is a wonderful poem about the South that is on the disk and not in the notes, it should have been the other way around - having a spoken only cut in the middle of a cd just doesn't work.The engineering is muddy - and that is putting it kindly.A frustrating disappointment."
1,Don't believe the hype...,"I bought this cd believe what I've heard that this band is the next big thing in the y'alternative/""no depression"" country-rock scene. No dice.This album is really tame and boring, nothing at all what you'd expect to hear in a southern rock cd. It just really sounds like these guys were really bored while they were making this cd, they just don't put any life or emotion into most of the songs. I honestly wouldn't even have been able to tell you that there was more than one guitar player in the band, most of the time it just sounds like one guy is overdubbing his solos on to the rhythm he's already played.This is just a tepid, bland and lifeless cd. Most bar bands pump more life into songs than these guys do on this cd. Very very disappointing..."
2,"fine with mouse and keyboard, sucks at images","Purchased one from Amazon/Tigerdirect. It comes with 2 sets of cables. Installation was easy and intuitive and it worked like charm for both keyword and mouse (I used both USB keyboard and mouse and had USB-to-PS/2 adaptor for both). However, it gave me highly blurry image output (LCD 1600x1200) compared to direct linking from the computer. I tried to downsize the display resolution but the blurriness was still visible. Decided to return it!The good thing about it? (If you really do not care about the image quality which I dont think so). Easy installation, no power supply needed, free 2 sets of cables, easy hotkey from the keyboard, stylish design etc."
3,Blurry Image,"I'm using an Eizo S2100 lcd monitor and an ATI FireGL V3100 adapter. At 1600x1200, the image is noticeably blurry compared to connecting the monitor directly. Using the phase adjustment on the monitor, I could clean up the image enough to be usable, but it is still not as sharp as before. If image quality is important to you, you will probably want to choose another KVM."
1,NO Customer Service,I spent three hours on the phone with D-Link tech support (India) trying to get a simple compatibility question answered. I finally spoke to someone in the corporate office who said they would connect me to a technician in the USA. When she transferred the call all I got was a recording saying the office was closed and call back on Monday. I packed up the switch and it will go back tomorrow. Their customer service/tech support is non-existent. I urge everyone to stay away from the D-Link brand.
3,Average KVM switch,"This KVM switch connects up to four computers as expected. Two cables are provided, the other two you have to buy yourself, and be sure to get Male-to-Male KVM cables (not all KVM cables are the same).Biggest limitation of this KVM: The video quality is not good enough to support a 1600x1200 resolution on my normally-crisp 19"" Insignia CRT screen. I had to drop my resolution down to 1280x1024, and now it is good enough to get by.The beeping problem is well documented here. I don't mind it, but it could annoy some. Basically, there are two beeps when you switch computers. By pressing ""Scroll-Lock"", ""Scroll-Lock"", ""B"" you can reduce it to only one beep, but you can't completely silence it as hoped.I am keeping the product because it is priced well for what it can do. But if you are a stickler for a sharp picture at higher resolutions, you may need to look elsewhere."
3,Okay not great,"Reasonably well written, reasonably complete. Not a lot of detail about construction techniques. I would have preferred more info about the actual how to..."
5,The Pastels really shine,"Glasgow, Scotland's Pastels really shine here, particularly on the song ""Yoga,"" which sounds something like what the Velvet Underground might have produced had they, like the Archies, had their own Saturday morning cartoon. In fact, the Pastels move beyond the ""shambolic,"" an adjective frequently used to describe their sound and demonstrate why they are, in fact, one of the great unsung rock bands of our day. Long may they continue to shine and to make joyous guitar pop like they do here."
3,NOT AN ECONOMICAL BUY,"These wonderful performances should not be written off. However, unless you are more interested in the performers than in the music I would go with the Domus version as, at a cheaper cost than this, you get a 2-disc set with equally outstanding versions of not only these two works, but also of the 2nd quartet plus a glorious rarity: Mahler's piano quartet movement."
5,Very good!,"Rubinstein is always very good. And in Brahms, it fascinates us.You will not be disappointed to buy this CD."
4,Just what I wanted,"I bought this bag for my Dad for Christmas. He goes on a lot of motorcycle trips with his friend and needed a lighter weight, warm bag. When I got the bag in the mail, I couldn't believe that it was an adult size. It was so incredibly lightweight. I had to take it out of the stuff sack and get in it just to make sure. He hasn't used it yet, but was very happy on Christmas morning. Great buy."
1,Teaches you everything ECXEPT how to use After Effects.,"Neither the cd or the book provides any tutorials explaining how to use the program from scratch. It ONLY provides samples, and is not very clear on how to recreate them. I reached page 70 without learning a thing about the program. I am a professional multimedia designer, in the business for 10 years, and found this to be one of the most unhelpful books on a computer program. This is the only time that a Visual Quickstart book has failed to help me. Visual Quickstart's book on Flash is a very good choice."
1,NOT designer friendly!,"I'm a graphic design student that is delving into the complex world of motion graphics, and I thought this book was convoluted and overly detailed. I fully acknowledge that I'm a beginner and tend to be more creative than technical, but I felt that perhaps the book could have been written with readers like myself in mind.Trying to get through this was like my asking for directions somewhere, and having the person tell me seven different ways to get to the location. The fact that he would take a method to do something in the program and explain three different ways to do it just made me feel more confused.I own an InDesign book made by Adobe that is a lot shorter and has a lot less text, and learned a lot faster just by using it as a reference and working on independent projects. I feel that this particular book has so much text in it, it would be hard to use it as a reference."
1,waste of time....,I wish I would have read the above review before wasting my time with this book.... going now to get my money back
5,I agree,"I also do not like to review the plot and story line when so many other reviewers have done so, please see those reviews. I thoroughly liked this book, and will read the rest in the series. Strong character and plot development coupled with an easy reading style made this a fairly rapid read, although the size of the book was daunting at first. The only negative I see in this book, and series I assume, is the complexity of the names of the characters. However, if one delves into the reasons for that, it simply adds an additional dimension to the understanding of the characters and their relative roles in the civilization Ms. Smith has devised. In contrast to some of the reviewers, I had no problem feeling attached to the characters, identifying with some, and disliking others. 2 thumbs up!"
2,disappointed,"I'm a bit sad I couldn't give Inda a better rating. First, it took me forever to read. That is not normal for me and indicates that something is wrong. It is a characteristic of the main problem of the book. I simply don't care about whats going on. I think this stems for the book being written more like a history or a biography relating specific events to the reader rather than a cohesive story. I don't feel like I was going along on a journey with the character rather I was just kind of told some stuff that happened to them. Inda is a good character, which is why this is particularly disappointing. The book really seemed like it just needed a good edit and a focus. What story is it trying to tell? That being said I enjoyed many of the small section in the book. It was almost like reading a short story collection where there are some sections I love and some I could live without and really don't seem relevant."
5,Great,"I really enjoyed this book and the entire series. I think that the characters were well developed and as you move along you glean more and more information to help you understand the motivations of the characters. It was a little challenging at first following the names and places, but once I was able to get them straight it made complete sense."

3,You'll Like It If You Like Movies About Ireland,"An Irish movie set in 1920. It starts kind of slow, like a period piece, but eventually picks up. It's about an older IRA gunman in hiding who befriends a wholesome and nave (and well brought up) eighteen year old girl. It's a wonderful movie. And the history is authentic."
3,I am disapointed,"This is the first time I have ordered something from Amazon that I felt it to give a bad review.It is too late to return the item as it is a gift to be given this week, but when I opened the package, first I noticed that even though I had written a gift card, it was not included.Then when I opened the package, the zipper on the utensil set broke. You can still use the ""nub"" to open it, but the entire zipper piece just broke.I am so disappointed in this item. I bought this as a special gift for a friend (specifically for the flamingos) and now I have to give it as it could have come out of a thrift shop instead of new. If I had time, I would return it as damaged and request a new one, but oh well....it is the thought that counts."
4,"The Ravel Trio in a minor is absolutely gorgeous, but the cellist is a little quiet","I love Ravel's Trio in a minor because it is so breathtaking. Although Maurice Ravel sticks to motifs which are only few in number, the charisma with which Rubinstein and Heifetz play make this work beautiful. It is exciting throughout, and the last movement is powerful.I wish Piatigorsky would play a little louder because I cannot hear him well over the forcefulness of the other two.Lastly, the fact on the CD cover that Rubinstein plays with a completely open piano on a full stick is interesting. Dont you think a half-stick would be more appropriate for chamber music?"
3,Interesting but disappointing,"I bought this book because it was mentioned in an interior decorating magazine. The idea of decorating around one's favorite season was intriguing. The book is full of good photography,quality paper, elegant prose, and generalities; it is sparse on specifics. You do get some idea of color for the walls(usually white)and for furniture (usually wicker/rattan--three out of the four seasons). However, much of the rest is up to the reader to glean from the photographs. If you are into collecting decorating books, this is for you. If you are looking for help, turn elsewhere."
5,A soulful reflection of the impact of homes on our lives,"The design is classic and elegant, the writing insightful, and the powerful seasonal images make the homes real rather than flat design showcases. Enjoy!"
3,Hawkwind-'Year 2000:Codename Hawkwind' (NMC/Pilot),"Nicely packaged in a soft cover snap case,shouldn't be very hard to spot as it sort of stands out in the CD bins.Disc one is another reissue(how many does that make now?)of the 'Space Ritual II' disc as it's been remastered and gives the listener a chance to hear slightly different versions of some of the tunes.Starts off with an alternative edit of ""Space Is Deep"",then really gets good as ""Orgone Accumulator"",""Upside Down"",""Time We Left(This World Today)"" and ""10 Seconds Of Forever"" proceed.Disc two is several assorted live cuts recorded in Cambridge,UK in September,1972.Have heard most of these tracks before.A bit raw sounding,but the quality is fine.Liked ""You Know You're Only Dreaming"",""You Shouldn't Do That"",""Hurry On Sundown"" and ""Paranoia"" the best.Another cool thing about 'Codename...' is it has an inner-changeable cover.Aimed pretty much at Hawkwind completists."
2,Another Stinker,"Be careful when buying from Hawkwind's catalog,there are far more poor sounding releases than good ones.This one sounds like trash.Get ""In search of Space"" ""Hall of the Mountain Grill"" or ""Quark,Strangeness+Charm"" instead.The sound quality is much better."
3,"Until a new domestic release of -Space Ritual-, this will do","The first CD is a re-release of -Space Ritual- volume 2, now out of print in the States. The second is a 1972 live performance, minus Lemmy.The original Space Ritual record is now available here only as an import that costs more than fifty dollars. The recording here was from the same period. Some of the tracks are not as good as the original Space Ritual, but the version of -Brainstorm- here is extended and uncut, unlike on my vinyl copy.Hawkwind's hypnotic yet driving psychedelic metal and Calvert's sciffy lyrics work much better live than in the studio. Hawkwind, moreover, had one of the best rhythm sections of any psychedelic band. The original Space Ritual was a classic for those who like noisy head trips. This will do until it return."
4,Space is deep and they where born to go.,"This record has a great load of songs, all which have been remastered. The remastered songs sounds awesome, but it doesnt really sound like a classic Hawkwind record anymore. It get's sorta ... well ... too clean ... I don't know whether this is good or bad...sometimes it works and sometimes it feels like they just should have left the song as it where before. Anyways, if you can't get your hands on Doremi fatsol latido , Spaceritual or Hall of the mountain grill : BUY THIS !"
1,"LIT ""A Place in the Sun""","I just recieved this album as a gift. It was number one on my gift list because I enjoyed the song ""My own worst enemy"" However, when I poped the CD into my personal CD player, I was disgusted. These guys are basically stuck in the 50's, or rather the ""cadillac, elvis presely"" years. The only song I like is My own worst enemy. I am very upset with the performance of this well known group."
4,Only one good song?!?!?!,"I just read all of the reviews, and whats with all the people saying ""My Own Worst Enemy"" is the only good song?! I like nearly EVERY song on the CD. Besides the fact that the songs sound great, the lyrics actually have meaning in them too. GREAT CD."
4,Catchy toons with punk influence,When I started listening to this CD I didn't like it at all but after hearing it 10 times I started to like it. Lit mixes punk and rock in a perfect blend so buy the record and enjoy it.
5,lit is one of the best bands out there,"i bought lit after hearing ""my own worst enemy"" on the radio and i am really impressed by the entire CD. it's definetly worth buying"
3,One good song + a bunch that sound just like it = ):,My Own Worst Enemy is a great song I'll admit that. But...the other songs sound almost just like each other. Buy the single unless you really like this kind of song. Over and over and over...
3,well..,"I saw this band live with creed, sevendust, staind and a few other bands. well they were very good live and moshable(heavy) the album dosent compare. Its average=3 stars. There is nothing new on this cd not already done before. dont get me wrong its not terrible but if you compare this to the bands i listen to... well it cant be done sorry"
5,Best Lit CD,"This Lit album RULES ! It's better than tripping the light fantastic & 5 smok'n tracks. The newest is the best. I think Miserable is the best. Trust me, buy it."
4,this is pretty good,hey all you amazon shoppers i really like this cd and i thought you would like it too it has no parental adviseory so it is safe for all children the beat and words are good and inspirein'thanks for reading my online review!
2,"Listen to ""My Own Worst Enemy,"" and then hit repeat","I don't understand how bands like Lit can make one great song for an album, such as ""My Own Worst Enemy,"" and then lose this magic while creating all the other songs. The only other song that has any value is ""Ziplock,"" but this is not even a song I like to listen to that much. Just keep hitting the repeat button on your CD player for song 2 (""My Own Worst Enemy""} and then you'll be fine. Be cautious about buying this album."
2,Nowhere near how good i thought it would be,"I would not reccomend this cd. My own Worst Enemy is one of my favorite songs, so I was excited when I got this. It turned out there are no other good songs besides it. All the other songs are terrible and sound exactly the same. If I could redo this I'd just get the single."
5,One RockiN' CD!,"This CD is definetly great and I reccomemnd it to everyone! The instrumentation and singing all get you drummin' your fingers and, if you've liked ""My Own Worst Enemy"" and ""Miserable"", there is much more yet to come on this CD! Buy it! It's truly worth it and I believe Lit putta a lotta heart into this here music makin' disc!"
4,The lyrics are a bit cookie-cutter,"I like this cd alot."" Ziplock"" is my favorite song, but some of the lyrics are a bit cookie cutter, and seem like they sing about the same things over and over. But overall I deem this a great CD!"
5,Great CD!!!,I just bought this CD yesterday and I'm already in love with it! The band uses an awesome sense of humor in their songs and it's really cool to listen to!!
5,GREAT!!!!,"This whole cd is awesome so its hard to pick a favorite. I like Zip Lock, Miserable, and My Own Worst Enemy the best. This band is definetly going places."
5,this is the best cd ever!!! . i can't stop listenining to it,hey. this cd is the total bomb!!! i can't stop listening to it. it has the best trax and the best tunes. the songs are the best and i learned every word to them the first week i got the cd. Lit's place in the sun is definately gonna be the cd for the summer. thanx.
5,The best CD I own!!!,"I got this CD for ""My Own Worst Enemy"", and fell in love with it immediately!!! All the songs on the album and awesome and deserves it six stars! If you like 3EB even the slightest bit, you will LOVE Lit more than anyhting!!! It is definitely worth the money!"
4,If you like to just feel good sometimes,"Despite some pretty dissapointing cds from other artists I have purchased recently, I decided to By ""A Place In the Sun"" based on what clips I heard online. I was pleasently supprised. What I heard was at times a little ""sing-songey"", but that fact was so well covered up my the style and lyrics that I hardly even noticed. This is defintely one to buy if you just like to feel good sometimes."
5,I love this CD!!,This is one of the best CDs that I have purchased. I love all the song on it and I know them all by heart. I recomend this CD to everyone!
5,"This cd is so good, it has been in my car since I got it!!!","The songs on this cd could all be hits in my opinion. The whole thing is great, catchy and will grow on you after one listening. I knew after seeing them at Woodstock I wanted the cd, now I want all of their music that they have ever done. I had heard the catchy song 'My Own Worst Enemy' on the radio, but didn't realize who it was. After the fantastic live Woodstock performance, I immediately bought their newest release: A Place in the Sun. I consider Lit to be one of the best bands out there right now."
4,Very Good Album,"""A Place in the Sun"" by Lit is a very good album. Songs such as ""Miserable"", ""Zip-Lock"", ""Four"", and ""My Own Worst Enemy"", make this a resonable investment in your CD collection. They (Lit) don't thrash out; keeping their mellow-yet-cheery vibe throughout 10-11 of 12 songs. The album features plenty of good guitar effects, as you can hear during the guitar solo of ""Miserable""."
4,Very impressive album from cover to cover,"It's hard to believe that these guys were unheard of a year or so ago. This album is fantastic, and live they are electrifying, too. The songs ""Down"", ""Miserable"", ""My Own Worst Enemy"", and ""Zimploc Bag"" are all very good. These guys remind me a little of Dexter Holland and The Offspring at times. Very good stuff, buy this album today!"
5,One of the best sounds I've heard in a LONG time!,"""A Place in....."" is terrific! I bought it because I heard ""My Own Worst Enemy"" performed by a local band and fell instantly in love with the song. I didn't expect to like the whole CD. Boy was I surprised! EXCELLENT! There may be only 1 or 2 songs I don't like! I am a devoted fan of '80's music and this one comes REALLY close to it! TRY IT!"
5,Save The Best For Second!,"Wow! Lit did a better job the second time around. I know many of you like the really hardcore stuff, but to me this is less annoying. Instead of plugging my ears, I actually want to hear what these songs are saying. There is not one song that is so chaotic that is will annoy you. There are a couple songs that I would not recommend. But I can't talk about those songs because the good outshines the bad by far. The best song on this album is definitely ""Lovely Day"". It's message a blended in with a catchy tune. If it doesn't have you singing along with it nothing will. This CD also has a great intro. I don't understand the title of the track but makes me want to party. If not into foul language you might have a problem with track 2 and 3. So far I only found one bad word in these tracks, but like I said; the Good outshines the bad. This is worth every cent."
5,The Best,"This is my favorite CD out of many. It has great songs and the the band is soooo good. If you are considering buying this product, GET IT. I like it because it is so upbeat. It gets you pumped. If its not good enough for you go listen to you stupid Eminem."
3,Tell me why....,"Most of the songs on this CD are pretty good. The best being ""My Own Worst Enemy."" Most of them really mean anything, but I guess that's just their style. Has the cool sound of a punk band, but you can understand what they're saying. Fun, but you get sick of it really soon. It isn't one you can listen to over and over. I say just have a friend lend it to you or something."
4,Pretty good CD,I admit that I bought the cd because of my own worst .... but as I listen to the rest of the songs I really didn't like. I thought it was not very hard to my liking. I then went to the silverchair concert and Lit opened it and it was great now I listen to the cd so much!!!!!
3,They could have done better,"All of these fans giving this cd 5 stars is obviously talking about the song My Own Worst Enemy and disregarded the rest of the album. With the exception of Four and Miserable and My Own Worst Enemy, the rest of the cd is a mindless blob of repetitious songs (if they are called songs). My suggestion is to tape My Own Worst Enemy from the radio, or find someone who already owns the cd to get the other 2 songs. There's no need for you guys to waste your money here. Maybe Lit's next album will be more worthwhile. Keep trying Lit!"
5,my fave band- better than the first LP,"I have ""tripping the light fantasic"" and it wasnt anything like their latest one. ""Down"" has a unique sound and the cool horn sound on ""Happy"" makes up for it. I like all 3 of their singles, anyway their pretty good ""Lovely Day"" was my favorite because it had one of the better punk sounds.I like the vocals that change through sometimes from A. Jay Poppoff and the unique sounds of the guitar from Jeremy, the drums of Allen and the bass from Kevin Baldes."
4,Need a new cd?,"If you need a new cd well u could get lit. The first time i heard it i didnt really like it, but it grows on you. Go ahead buy it!!"
3,Entertaining,"This cd was entertaining but thats it. This cd has a few cool song like ""my own worst enemy"" and ""Zip lock"" that sound good. The guitar player is great and the rest of the band is pretty skillful and knows what their doing but i think they should of spent more time creating a cd that is more than a ""One Hit Wonder""."
1,"featuring ""My Own Worst Enemy""","just like the sticker on the front of the CD says; featuring ""My Own Worst Enemy"". this CD clearly has only a single hit song. the rest of the CD; i guess, could have been a lot better."
2,"Just buy the single of ""My own Worst Enemy""","When I hear MOWE on the radio, I thought the CD wouls be great, and I liked Completely Miserable pretty well, too, which is why I gave this CD 2 stars. Lit is yet to prove their ability as one of those bands where you can just listen to the whole CD without skipping songs. Lit is ok, but they have a long way to go before the reach the level of Green Day, Blink-182, and the Offspring."
1,Unlistenable!,"""My Own Worst Enemy"" is the only song on this CD worth listening to. Save yourself money, and just buy the single. I agree with the Village Voice in ranking this disk among the worst of 1999!"
2,Not as Good as I Remember it Being,"I had this one in high school. I remember loving it. After purchasing it, I realized it wasn't as good as I remembered it being. Granted, it has brought back quite a few memories, but I don't really know if they're really worth remembering. It's up to you, buy it if you want."
4,lit up and rockin!!!!!!,"Poppy hooks tied to layers of heavy guitar and a lead singer who can even scream on key. that about sums this great miracle of rock-n-roll that mortals call a cd. The songwriting is very good and you'll find yourself snapping your fingers to""Happy"", and ""Ziplock""especially. Onlya few tracks did I not find too rock-worthy which is not to say they're not good songs. These guys rock hard but with full emotion. dig the thrash-slow-thrash-chorus of ""NO BIG THING"". Buy this cd or borrow it. I suggest buy it. Especially if there's a girl you are with and you fight. Then you can just send her a copy of ""My Own Worst Enemy"" Rock therapy..worx everytime"
5,*Great Band!!!*,"100% Punk Rock. I bought the CD for ""My Own Worst Enemey"" now thats the only song i skip on the cd. The other songs are alot better! I dont think i'll ever get tired of LIT. Ya Gotta get the CD!"
5,AWSOME,"Dude, this C.D rock it is one of the best I have ever bought. I saw them live and they just kicked they blew me away. The also have a '60's sound to them to. I guess that is good 'cause they say they look up to Sinitra which many people whom are under the age of 30 dont. Well, I guess that would be all just buy the C.D and check put 5 smockin tracks from Lit 'cause it really shows a diff. side to them"
4,this cd is allright,"this cd is allright but not great it has a few good songs like ""my own worst enemy"" and ""zip lock"" and ""the best is yet to come undone"" but other than that they have no rythme"
1,It's all about attitude baby.. YAWN!,"Lit, a prime example of why most radio music is boring today. There is nothing distinguishing here, just bubble gum in your ear. Catchy perhaps, thin without a doubt. Lit is just another addition in the litany of la la fluff rock from the new Swingers-esq LA music scene that was tired before it began. I'm sure they'll go away as quickly as they arrived."
4,Interesting,"I am a fan of rock. But Lit's Cd was quite an intersting expirence. I bought it after hearing the song,""my own worst enemy"". This is a cd i haven't gotten sick of yet."
4,Not bad,"I bought this album for the song My Own Worst Enemy. That happens to be one of my favourite songs, really good to drum to when warming up, so naturally I don't like the other songs as much, but they stand on their own very well. I really like how they change tune and their sound so that the songs don't sound at all the same, keeping it fresh. While there are some tracks I could do without, as a whole it was a good buy."
5,very awesome CD,"Lit's A Place in the Sun is by far freakin awesome. Every song on it is excellent, even the slower one Miserable. If you get the CD you won't be disappointed. I got it years back and I still love listening to it over and over again and I'm still not sick of it! Go out and buy it... it's worth it."
4,Pretty Good,My freind said all the songs on this cd are awesome.I did'nt totally agree with him.But the cd is still very good.Anyone who likes blink 182's Dude Ranch will like Place In The Sun as much as I do.
5,i hate one hit wonder exucers,hey im a huge punk rock fan and im sick and tired of people telling me that they are sick that bands dont put more time into albums. well guess what its people like you that make me sick. you hear the song on mtv so you say ive got to have it so you run out and but and listen to that one song over and over again until its either out of style or you dont like it any more. so why dont you listen to the rest of the cd before you just lable it something becasue i thought my own worst enemy was a a good song but there were far better songs on the cd so hey just because its on mtv doesnt mean you have to like it but thats ok if you do just listen to all there song not the one 12 year old kids think is cool
4,"Solid CD through and through, plus they have a great name!","Everyone at work is growing tired of me screaming, ""My car is in the front yard! And I'm sleeping with my clothes on!"" I can't get My Own Worst Enemy out of my head. This CD is a nice mix of rock/punk/pop. The only drawback is the monotony of the band's only real theme - relationships. Still, you can't help but to jump around to this music. If these guys mature in their songwriting they will be HUGE!"
4,A Poem to the Universe,"""Saving Adam"" by L. Smith is one evening's read that will stay with you. Told primarily from the viewpoint of a woman for whom perseverance and faith are bywords, I was inspired to read it through to the end in one sitting.A tad short on some of the writing skills we are accustomed to finding in memoirs, this story works for me. It is told with humor, the language is spare and the protagonist is a woman in charge of her own destiny. It also does not preach. It simply tells the story of a woman who loves and, in doing so, affects the lives of those around her.One of the other reviewers mentioned that this book should be turned into a movie. Darn right! The central character is any novelist's or screenwriter's dream.""Saving Adam"" is, in short, a poem to the universe without a single poetic phrase between its covers.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of ""This is the Place"""
2,Barely Adequate,"This ""book"" is extremely short, gives very little information that a person with an interest in the era would not already know, is slanted towards Americans (who have different etiquette from the British) and has parts where the author attempts to pass off his personal opinions as ""etiquette"".I cannot recommend it. As a curiosity for people who know nothing of the subject, maybe. Otherwise it should be avoided. There are better books that give far more information, and better quality information.The two stars are for the few interesting points the book makes, but mostly for the illustrations."
2,Essential? not really,"Rather than being an 'essential handbook', this publication has merely an incomplete, snickering look at common social practice in 19th century USA."
4,Great gift,This was a Christmas gift for my fiancé . He works for the forest service in Northern California on small timber sales.He really enjoys watching Ax Men. He can really relate to what is going on in the show and understands the terminology and dangers involved more than most people. He has thanked me several times for giving him season 5 to add to his collection.Turns out this was the best gift he recieved this year. Its really hard to get his attension when he is watching.
3,ok,just ok. I wish more of the old crews were still on. After 4 great seasons I was a little let down.
5,great,Used other 'flavors' before but like the unscented version. Works like it should. Would purchase again. Is my main body soap
4,Great Product,I make homeade body wash and this worked perfectly to add to my recipes. Good lather and mild on the most sensative skin.
1,Hate it,What is withthe hype of this stuff. It is definitely not unscented. Has a gross smell that follows you around and make skin dry. Waste
5,It works,"I am trying to go as natural and organic as possible. But I also like to buy from reputable companies. And with Dr. Bronner products I found it. This soap works great. I use it for everything: 1. To wash my hair, which lathers very nicely; it does leave my hair a little dry, so I need to use a conditioner along and it does the job. 2. To wash my face which by the way is very sensitive skin, and it doesn't irritate it. 3. In the soap dispensers to wash our hands. I like to buy products that serve more than one product and this product definitely has a lot of uses."
5,Great product,"I like this, it suds up without the chemicals added. Mild on the skin and no smell or fragrance. Great organic product."
5,Wonderful,I purchased Dr. Bronners as an ingredient to make my own baby wipes and it works wonderfully! I'm happy to be wiping my son's bum with something so clean and free of chemicals!
5,Love this stuff!,"This is the greatest alternative to shower gels and bar soaps! I dilute about 1/3 with water and use with a foaming soap pump. Since this one is unscented, you can add a few drops of essential oil for fragrance :)"
5,Animal-friendly product safe for sensitive skin,"I have difficulty finding products that are both free of animal products and testing AND safe for sensitive skin (unscented). I would recommend this product, as I have been using it for about a month and it has not caused any skin reactions. The larger size is also extremely economical, as you only need to use a very small amount at a time. It is a great product for those who want an cruelty-free, eco-friendly soap for sensitive skin!"
5,Nearly Perfect,"I've tried LOTS of different soaps and body washes over the years to combat severely dry skin. Some have smelled really nice but dried my skin, and one left me feeling moisturized but not clean. Dr. Bonner's is nearly perfect. It doesn't dry my skin at all and leaves me feeling clean. It also works very well as a shampoo for my dog with hyper-sensitive skin. Plus it's natural and cruelty free.The scent is a bit odd, as is the writing all over the bottle. But those are the only shortcomings I've found, so I'm sticking with it :^)"
3,Don't get in baby's eyes,Product is not tear free. Found out after my daughter complained and I tested it in my own eyes. Ouch!
5,Liquid Soap,I buy this over and over. It is pure castile soap. I also buy the bars. This is an excellent product.
4,Surprisingly Good!,"As a longtime McCartney fan I bought this CD with the expectation of it sitting in my collection gathering dust (like the CHOBA B CCCP did). I generally don't like remakes of old songs. However, this really surprised me. It really is excellent and Paul's goal of trying to record like the Beatles used to in the old days worked beautifully. If George had been playing guitar and Ringo had been on drums you'd swear it was the fab four again. The 3 new McCartney tunes are very good as well, and by covering semi-obscure oldies to many people the entire CD sounds new and fresh. Highly recommended."
4,Big Time Good Vibes!,"With RDR, Macca has once again hit his stride, doing what he does best: belting out rock and roll. Not since the Fabs recorded ""I'm Down"" has a studio been rocked this hard. This is a CD packed full with good vibes and spine tingling rock and roll. The vocals and the bass clearly and effortlessly carry that weight! How refreshing. One to cherish!"
2,Nothing New,"Sure, Paul McCartney is a great singer-performer. But his greatest gift is that of songwriting. It's a bit of a letdown to have so few McCartney originals on this album. My advice to Paul would be this -- if you want to do some old-style rock and roll, write some old style rock and roll tunes. Don't perform other people's stuff. It's boring.McCartney's 3 new tunes rock. ""Try Not To Cry"" is great, much better anything on the radio today. I really wish the whole album were full of McCartney originals in this vein."
3,It Okay!,"The CD Was Great, But The Case Was Broken Though! But Every Thing Was Great And Good Price! I'll Buy Again!"
3,"Great music, lousy mix","Spirited, passionate performances by Sir Paul and his all-star pick-up band, but as I recall from when this album was first released back in '99, the CD mix is dense, loud and muddy. I found it fatiguing to listen to, except in small doses. Perhaps better for serious Beatle collectors to seek out the British vinyl edition of the work, if you can find one."
2,This is Paul McCartney?,"I really do love Paul McCartney's music. But when I bought this I have to say I was very disapointed. All it is is a bunch of remakes. Which is alright. But they all sound the same. I only like a few on this CD. ""Run Devil Run"", ""No Other Baby"", ""Lonesome Town,"" ""Try not to Cry"", ""Maggie May"", ""What it Is, "" and ""Coquette"". It's really not that good of a CD. Sorry."
2,WHY? Come on Paul! You've done this already!,"I am an unconditional McCartney fan. I have stuck with him even with such ghastly albums like ""McCartney II"" and ""Off the Ground."" However, while ""Run Devil Run"" displays Paul's love for the classics, it doesn't give us anything new. This record is revisiting what he did on the ""Russian Album.""In my view, the last good record that McCartney made was ""Flowers in the Dirt"" in 1989. There he demonstated his craft for solid pop melodies (something that has lacked in many other of his 80's works, (i.e ""Press to Play"" and ""Spies Like Us."") ""Flaming Pie"" seemed a bit vacant somehow.... almost anit-climactic. I was a let down.In any case, let's hope that Paul can come out with another solid pop album along the lines with ""Tug of War"" and ""Flowers in the Dirt"" and stop revisitng old material we've heard from him(and others) before."
1,I couldn't listen to it!,"I have every Paul McCartney cd ever recorded. McCartney 2 was shakey but I am sorry to say that Run Devil Run is the worst album I have ever purchased by anyone! It sounds like the 50's! There is not one good song on the entire cd. I am a huge McCartney fan, so it pains me to say it. I know he can do better than this. If not, he had better give it up!"
4,The best singer on earth (the best composer in the universe),"I have just heard the album for the first time and I must say I'm really proud of Paul.I give this album four stars because I think that some of the 50's songs are really bad (perfectly sung though). The best things about this album are : 1) the way Paul and the band perform the songs , it's just flawless . 2) Paul's new songs are GREAT , I hope Paul is going to record an album full of his own new songs now that he's shown how full of energy he and his music still can be (Flaming Pie is a wise (5 star) album but I'd love to hear something as full of life as his early 70's masterpieces (RAM,etc.)).Looking forward to what is yet to come ..."
5,Very good CD!,"Run Devil Run is very, very good. This is the liveliest that Paul has been in a long time (Even though No Other Baby kinda puts me to sleep). The band is very good, and Paul's bass playing is spectacular as always. My favorite songs on here are Run Devil Run, Brown Eyed Handsome Man, Blue Jean Bop, and Shake A Hand. This CD rocks! Anyone who loves rock and roll should own this."
3,WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING!,"This Paul McCartney just having fun with his mates. It's old songs covered by him and does pretty well I think. If you like songs from the oldies, like from Elvis and Chuck Berry, then try this one! It's worth it."
4,Best Oasis Album since that Yellow Bathosphere thingy,"Brilliant emotional playing and singing by the smeg-head brothers. Let's take a look at the credits. Ian Paice - Drums, David Gilmour - Guitar, Paul McCa...... wait a tick. I've been hoodwinked! But still. This is the best DEEP PURPLE album in years. McCartney hasn't rocked like this since his ""Smoke on the Water"" days. Ah yes, so this is what rock'n'roll sounds like."
3,It didn't sound like Gilmour,"If you're looking for a companion piece to the Russia album, or John Lennon's Rock 'n 'roll, this is fantastic! If you are looking to a follow up to Flaming Pie, Flowers in the Dirt, or Band on the Run, it's not so great. Personally, I was really looking forward to some amazing guitar work after reading the credits. David Gilmour... WOW! But to receive very standard studio-session type sound, was disappointing. If you enjoy old Beatles covers a la ""That's Alright Mama"", this CD is for you!"
3,a solid rushed perfmance,"When I first heard ""I Got Stung"" over the net, I knew i had to buy this album no matter what...the recording was done in a rushed atmosphere, which is good considering the nature of Rock n'Roll...however, I felt somehow something was lacking....maybe it was George and John and Ringo with some backing vocal ""oohs"" and ""yeahs"""
4,Rock And Roll by someone who understands how its done!,"I also was not expecting anything from Paul so soon after Linda's death. But this is a logical CD for him to make, because it finds him looking back at his youth and what made him love life then. I would expect his next CD to be more directed at his personal life and his loss.But for now let us all just enjoy some great rock from Paul. This is alot more raw than the Russia CD and the production runs from crystal clear to very loud and blaring at times, but still great to hear that ""live in the studio"" sound. Also, the choice of more obscure songs is very interesting.Best selections are She Said Yeah, All Shook Up, Run Devil Run (an original), I Got Stung, and Party. I was not really expecting to enjoy this CD so much but I am playing it for my co-workers right now!"
4,Why Can't He Do This All Of The Time?,"In reading interviews conducted with McCartney prior to the release of Run Devil Run, I learned that his band had ZERO time to reherse any of these tunes prior to entering the studio. That undoubtedly accounts for the freshness of the performances. The drumming is particulary good throughout.My hope moving forward is that Paul will grow from the success and critical acclaim of this recording and write and perform the kind of material that we all know he's capable of. His singing is the finest put on disc or vinal since Band on the Run."
5,Some People Like to Rock...,"This CD is a real favorite of mine. Paul rocks from start to finish. I think Paul really sings these cover songs well, and his 3 new ones are good too, my favorite being Try Not to Cry. Really is good to see that Paul can still belt out the lyrics.Some of my recommendations for just having a good time are All Shook Up, Run Devil Run, Try Not to Cry, Brown Eyed Handsome Man, What it Is, I Got Stung, Honey Hush, Party. Some less rocking but very nice songs are No Other Baby and Lonesome Town.If you like good old pure rocking songs, then this CD is for you."
3,50's rock revisited,"As long as you know what you're getting into with this album you may not be disappointed. These 50's tunes (including a few written by McCartney)are performed with a slightly different spin, but are still pretty recognizable. These tunes are a throwback to many of the songs contained on the early beatles albums, when they performed rock and roll songs written by Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, etc. Overall a bit of a disappointment to me, since i've ""been there and done that"" a long time ago!"
3,It could have been better if...,"I certainly won't begrudge anyone making the music that he or she likes and while a few of the tunes on the album are quite engaging. others sound too much of a knock-off. However,it's the over-all sound of the record that bothers me the most. Yes, all of the original versions of the songs made use of echo but McCartney's production has the songs smothered in it. It creates a distance between the songs' performances and their inherent capacity to evoke an emotional response that's personal to the listener."
4,"Wow! Ok, wow! Go Sir Paul!","Well, I'm only 16, so I totally missed the 50's by a couple of decades. That's why this was a totally new experience for me- and that's why I was a little disappointed at first, even though I knew it was mostly a bunch of covers.But then I really got into it and felt a lot better about it. It really, truly rocks! It's great to hear a different kind of rock and roll, although I thought Flaming Pie was better, so that's why I had to give it a 4.Paul McCartney, in my opinion, is the best rock and roll artist ever!! He ended up not disappointing me on this one. He still rules!"
2,"I am the BIGGEST McCartney fan, but...","I was 6 years old when the Beatles broke up. I remember wondering why so many people thought they were so good. I grew up and realized why. Paul has always been my fav. I saw him in '90 and can now die in peace. I have every McCartney album (including most bootlegs; when he was with Wings; and when he was with the Beatles). I think that Lennon complimented him, but that after '67, McCartney was the Beatles (John has admitted this). This is the first and only album that Paul has done that has disappointed me. All Shock Up is fine, but he sounds like he is too much out of breath through the whole album. Yes, I know he is pushing 60...but he is competing with 18 year-olds. PAUL...do you know why people don't buy those old songs? I would rather hear 14 new McCartney songs and be blown away as I was in the past with Band, Tug, Flowers, and Pie."
2,I love Paul but....,"I have loved Paul all my life, have every CD and vinyl song he ever made, even dogs like ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" (with picture sleeve). But this is a lousy album. Paul's voice sounds an octave higher than it should be on several songs, particularly ""Lonesome Town."" But my main criticism is the mixing of this album. He was obviously going for a ""raw"" sound, but he went way overboard. The bass and guitars sound fuzzy and not sharp and it sounds as if they didn't rehearse worth a damn. I much prefer the rock n roll album Paul did in Russia. The only song I can listen to on this album without getting a headache is ""I Got Stung,"" but Elvis did it better.I still love Paul forever, but I'm going back to ""Flaming Pie"" to dispel the bad taste this album left in my mouth."
3,Rocks Hard,"Nice hard rocking sound. Fun album. Paul and the band sound great. Paul's voice is in great form. Some great tunes like Lonesome Town, Run Devil Run, She Said Yeah, Party, and All Shook Up. I like it, but I'd much rather see Paul come up with an album full of original tunes that rock this hard. If he were to do so, he'd win as many Grammy's as Santana won last night."
4,Better with every play,"This is an infectious album and it sounds better every time you cue it up. Paul's vocals never sounded better and the song choices are more interesting than the CCCP album. In fact, it's a superiror album to CCCP and, if you like early Beatles recordings, this one is a good choice."
3,"Paul ""gets back""","A good collection of 50's ravers. I do think the CD is a bit overproduced and slick for a lot of the material. I listen to Ricky Nelson's ""Lonesome Town"" 'cause it's so atmospheric and, well, lonely-sounding. Here it just seems like a run-through. Same with ""All Shook Up,"" though admittedly any remakes of those two would pale in comparison. I like the energy that went into ""She Said Yeah,"" and ""Party"" and two of the 3 Paul originals I really do like (""Run Devil Run"" and ""What It Is""). This is the sort of ""side project"" that I like to hear from established artists. It's interesting and fun, if not classic."
3,OLD ROCK AND ROLL,It;s a ok cd Mc has done better. But I like new stuff more than all cover stuff but thats Me.
3,conformity,"1964 Ed's big shoe. Critics said, ""they look girls."" {my folks} By[beatles]their own definition, they took themselves lightly, their acclaim moderaterly, and their music seriously. By these parameters, I thank-you Paul."
3,"Good, but lacking","Paul ought to be ashamed of himself for releasing a CD barely over a half hour and selling it at full price. What music there was I enjoyed a lot, especially novel arrangments of songs like All Shook Up. Nonetheless, I refuse to rate this higher than 3 stars."
1,It stinks!!!! And I love Paul. He needs to get creative.,PAUL IS SO TALENTED THAT FOR HIM TO GO BACK IN TIME IS SAD. WHEN PAUL WAS HUNGRY HE MADE IT WITH THE BEATLES;THEN WHEN HE HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE HE WAS A SMASH WITH WINGS. BUT THIS HAS BECOME A BUBBLE GUM STAR WHO HAS RUN DRY OF FRESH IDEAS. IF PAUL WAS TO GET TOGETHER WITH SOME NEW TALENT AND COME OUT WITH A NEW SOUND HE MIGHT GET BACK TO WHERE HE ONCE WAS. HE NEEDS TO REINVENT HIS SOUND LIKE THE STONES. IF HE DOES NOT SOON HE WILL BE A FOOT NOTE IN HISTORY AND HE IS TOO GOOD FOR THAT FATE. BEST TO ALL . RICKY
4,Paul keeps on rockin',"This album sounds great. Paul makes these old rock songs sound contemporary. The best tracks are the three McCartney originals. It proves that McCartney can still rock with the best of them. The song ""Run Devil Run"" is one of Paul's best rock compositions EVER!!!"
5,A great album that gets even better with each listen.,"Paul is in great vocal form and the band plays with great enthusiasm. This recording has a live spontaneous feel to it. The choice of material is exceptional, from classic standards to obscure gems. The inclusion of three new McCartney originals was nice treat. Run Devil Run is my favorite track and I loved the arrangement of Brown Eyed Handsome Man. A great album by one of music's greatest artists whose singing, playing and writing continues to show great vitality."
4,a back to roots winner,"McCartney shines in a cherry picked four piece band singing songs from his early beginnings with John in their early teens. Needs a second listen to fully appreciate Paul's heart and soul digging into early R & B, country, and even a Ricky Nelson classic. Not trying to copy Elvis or Buddy, he takes you back on his own terms."
5,Great Tribute Album,"Paul McCartney's tribute album to 50s rock is a great album. These songs were inspirational to McCartney and inspired him when he was with The Beatles. These songs plus the three McCartney originals are true to 50s rock. The guitar by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour is phemonenal throughout the record. This album also has a dark undertow with Paul's performance of songs like No Other Baby and Lonesome Town because of the passing of his wife Linda. Favorites include Blue Jean Bop, All Shook Up, Run Devil Run, No Other Baby, Lonesome Town, Brown Eyed Handsome Man, Coquette, I Got Stung, Shake a Hand, and Party. Highly Recommended."
5,Mac gets it right again,"In recent years, McCartney has moved into new areas of art and music with paintings and several well-received classical pieces. However, ""Run Devil Run"" proves the artist can still rock like few others. This album of mostly covers is crisp, tight, and finds McCartney sounding as good as ever. With a phenomenal band in place, and an interesting selection of tunes, McCartney's voice and bass playing is near perfect. The three original tunes fit in nicely with the other songs and again shows that McCartney is one of the world's most talented and hard-working musicians."
4,A feel good album,"Personaly, I don't care much for the type of songs on this album, but I bought it because Paul is one of the greatest musicians of all time. After listening to the album and reading the album notes, I realized how much the album means to Paul. The songs have great beats, and with Paul's great voice you can't go wrong. ""Lonesome Town"" and ""What it is"" are the two best on the album. The oldies featured on the album in which I previously did not care for grew on me. The album is uplifting and upbeat. It's a feel good album."
1,una mierda como una casa,"Sois todos unos pringaos y unos macarras que si ""Paul really rocking"" ""getting back to his roots"" "" in great shape"", mis cojones. Para que hostias queremos otro disco de rock and roll de paul mccartney ,que pasa que no puede inventarse canciones nuevas ?.No me jodas hombre esto es una perdida de tiempo y yo como la mayooria de vosotros que soy un enfermo voy y me lo compro ,pero hombre si hasta el mismisimo wings wild life es mejor que esto. En fin esperemos que se le pase y nos sorprenda con algo bueno e interesante aunque tal y como van las cosas no me extranaria que se retirara y se dedicara a tocarle el munon a la nina coja esa con la que sale que podria ser su hija."
3,conformity,"1964 Ed's big shoe. Critics said, they look like girls. {my folks} By[beatles]their own definition, they took themselves lightly, their acclaim moderaterly, and their music seriously. By these parameters, I thank-you Paul."
2,Oh You're So FAB Paul....,"If only the self-absorbed, obnoxious personality of McCartney could be removed from this recording. The best thing about this is the great band assembled- which barely gets a mention. McCartney wallows in his usual ""ain't I cute"" obsession. The accompanying booklet actually has a drawing of McCartney looking like Elvis- with the caption ""Elvis McCartney"". Dude, as far as being the authentic source of rock 'n roll, you don't measure up to a bead of sweat on Elvis' brow. Overall, superb musicianship. Gilmour is great. Song choice is so-so; some songs are preadolescent-level embarrassments, others are good solid rock 'n roll. Why this guy is still trying to come off as a teenie heartthrob, I don't know. A very professional effort by a bunch of guys who really know what they're doing, but still comes off sounding contrived and fake."
1,Simply Poor!,"I can think of much better Rock albums than this...I think that in the over 200 reviews here, we can see that Mccartney fans are blind and deaf! The first track is good with some great guitar work.....but the rest just because one huge blast of distorted sound....like a radio dial lacking clear reception....the album is loud in the same way Ricky Martin's music is loud....but there is little to truly appreciate...McCartney once again tries to hard to prove himself...first MCartney tries to prove that he's into art like the embarressing exhibitions he's done, then prove that he's into avante garde like the Fireman stuff, then a poet with his Standing Stone ego, then he tries to prove that he's a rocker...even in Anthology 2 he changed the track line up so his Rockier song would come after Lennon's ballads...costing many more trees to be choopped for corerected booklets....I hope someday the real McCartney comes out....but right now he neeeds to retire!"
4,"Fun, and with some surprises","I saw this one in the used CD store and decided to give this one a listen. It was a blast, plus Paul covered some obscure songs, which is what sold me. Instead of covering just overplayed oldies, he dug deeper and put a nice spin on the familiar tunes as well. It gives the listener a great perspective on the roots of rock, without being overbearing. To those out there that say the only good music came out ages ago need to remember one thing: this music was disliked back then by another generation just as much as you dislike today's music. If music always stayed the same, it would have gotten very boring and rock never would have happened. Then you wouldn't have this great CD to listen to. Think about it!"
5,Amazing,"THIS is what Paul McCartney was born to do. This COMPLETELY blows away anything he's ever done. This is one of his greatest solo albums, right up there with Band on the Run. Paul can rock, and he rocks his heart out. Rock in it's purest form."
4,Back to his roots,An interisting and enjoyable Mccartney album in which you hear and feel the sounds of very early Beatles material.
