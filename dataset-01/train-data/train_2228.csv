3,Eh,Its alright I guess. I really wanted something strictly for weddings. It covers a number of subjects but really this is 2012 do what you want for most everyday situations.
1,Dated and a little nasty,"This book is dated, and Miss Manners comes off as more than a little nasty at times. Some of her advice is sound, but some of it is not up to date and seems aimed at the 1950s housewife, which she probably was at one time herself. The worst part of this book (and her columns) is that she herself comes off as not all that well-mannered. She often suggests snippy, snide retorts to people, and she lapses into what sounds like nouveau-riche snobbery vs. well-bred, well-mannered behavior and attitudes. Don't buy this. There are better, frankly classier etiquette books and writers out there."
3,Essay Collection,"""Miss Manners"" is a talented author, and the etiquette advice she offers is useful and entertaining. However, if you are looking for a reference, rules-type textbook, keep looking. This book is a collection of essays arranged in a Q & A format and, in my opinion, is more of an amusing near-novel than a guidebook."
1,This is not what you want for a good sound,"I puchased this to replace an old realistic 4way crossover I had, when I hooked it up I got a horrible engine noise that I never heard before. I tried everything I could but this thing was to cheap to add to my system. I bought a name brand crossover that day from a local store and the sound was amazing, that let me know that this crossover was a P.O.S. and really dont buy it from the company World Class Inc. after paying for this junk and paying to have it shipped back to them for a return and the 15% restocking fee I am out of the same amount I paid for the Name brand crossover from my local stereo store. SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
3,Muffinlover,"I haven't made that many of the recipes yet, but I have looked through them all and have found many different ones to try. My duaghter hates muffins and when she tried the blueberry ones she loved them. Can't wait to try the others."
2,14 Degrees Short,"I tested the AE-9.5. If it worked as advertised, it would be a great little piece of equipment - but it doesn't. It is advertised to achieve an 84 degree rise at .75 gallons per minute. The best that I could do after ten tests was a 70 degree rise. Here are my test results.Incoming water - 48 degreesGallons per minute - .75 GPMHeated Water Temp - 118 degreesI did hit 125 degrees or 77 degrees once but not for .75 gallons per minute.For my test, I set the AE-9.5 on a table about 30 inches off the floor. I wired the unit to 240 volts. Actual voltage, 242. The heated water was directed into a two gallon pail using a two foot section of hose. The distance from the unit to the pail was minimized so as not to affect the results. I used a sealed thermometer to measure the water temp. Each test ran for two minutes.I called the Bosch support line for help but it was after hours and they weren't able to answer my questions."
5,MikeVeryPleased,Recieved before predicted delivery. Received in perfect condition. Easy install except for #8 wiring which is hard to handle and run entire length of garage.Worked exactly as advertised. My house pressure at well is 40-60#. I measured the incomming water temp and outgoing temp. Output is well within spec. Water temp of 110-120 deg F at faucets and shower is more than enough. Electric bill was not adversely affected. Good job.
1,Not so good,"Made only luke warm water at my utility sink 3 foot away. I called and I was told that it was because I had 208 volts. Well, the unit is 240 or 208. Why don't they say it will not work on 208? Would it really work on 240 volt? Not sure, but I dought it would make hot water at all. I'm a electrician (20 years) so I know it was installed properly. I would never buy another one. They would not refund at all. Get a 2,4,6 or 8 gallon tank instead. My 6 gallon works great at the utility sink. Hot water right now. I put a timer on it when I need it the most. Daytime only."
1,What a waste of good money,"I can't believe I just blew 200 bucks...This tankless hot water heater isn't performing at all like it said it would...The water is barely luke warm...I'm very dissapointed and will see about getting my money back...Save your money, your time and don't buy this one..."
5,Who knew a uke could sound so great.,"I heard JAKE perform live last summer and we fell in love with his ""Ave Maria"". This cut is gorgeous, but so is everything else on the CD. Highly recommended for anyone who loves string repertoire."
4,"Excellent young musician, great ukulele player","This is a very good CD. Jake is still young, and has a tendency to want to show off his wonderful technique a bit much, but he is already a fine musician and he does know how to choose his music well. Once he matures a bit, and gets over his ""king of the speedway"" approach to playing, he will be one of the great jazz/rock ukulele players, right up there with Lyle Ritz and Ohta-San. He certainly has the talent."
3,Not Jake's Best,"This is Jake's first solo CD (without a band) and I bought it solely because of the song ""While my Guitar Gently Weeps"" (I like the version on ""Heartbeat"" better). This album has a different sound than the rest of Jake's CDs. As far as the songs go, a lot of them are pretty slow. Jake has redone a few of his old songs like: Spain, Wish on my Star, and Let's Dance. If you are trying to experience ""Jake"" I would recommend ""Heartbeat"" or ""Crosscurrent"" over this album any day.3 StarsBest Songs:* While my Guitar Gently Weeps* Spain* Heartbeat/dragon"
5,Great compilation,I use this book every time I am in need of a story to tell my class that they most likely never heard
4,"Good Magazine, Nice Stories","The stories I've read in Zoetrope have been generally long with a surprising twist close to the ending.You can check out zoetrope's website to see what's coming up before you subscribe. They sometimes have famous people (writers, tv producers, etc) contribute work."
2,"Boooooring stories, silly art, waste of money",I picked this up on a whim. I wish I'd put the money into a book or a twelve pack of beer or an over-due parking ticket.
3,broken plastic handle,"I love the pot. Had it for about 6 months. The plastic part of the lid handle has partly broken off. I thought it might have been my kids, but after reading the previous review, it seems it could be a design flaw. So I am holding off on bying a second one."
4,Great !!!,The quality and value of this product is unsurpassed. A great timesaver for all pasta cooking in smaller quantities. I would highly recommend this and all Circulon products.
1,Faulty Lids,"My first order - the lid required excessive force to be secure on the pot - the second order wasn't much better. So, I give up and will switch brands."
3,Great Covered Pan with Locking Colander,I love this covered pan when cooking spaghetti; it's so easy to drain the pasta with this unique lid.
3,NOT VESA 200 compliant,"Mount is nice but is not VESA 200 compliant. An optional mounting bracket is required. The bracket that is part of the package only goes up to VESA 100. Also the metric sized hardware requires a metric allen wrench which they provide, but it is not hardened and quickly rounds over when fastening the screws into studs. Be prepared to improvise."
4,Pretty Good,"I think this Rent CDis wonderful if you like just the best songs. I like it because it has the best songs but if you love Rent, splurge for the full one. Otherwise,enjoy!!!"
3,There's something missing...,"It's impossible to capture the true essence of Rent without hearing every song. For first time listeners, go out and buy the original for ten extra bucks...you'll be glad you did. Otherwise, if you're a Rent junkie like myself, you can never get enough, right?"
3,"Truncated ""Rent"" fails to communicate Larson's genius.","Rent, in my opinion, is one of only a handful of musicals where every song is essential to not only communicating the story but the emotions of those who tell it. Though this highlights collection is quite good, it fails to provide the listener with the full impact of Jonathan Larson's theatrical masterpiece. Some of my personal favorites that are missing are ""You'll See"", ""Happy New Year,"" ""Christmas Bells"" and ""Over The Moon."" As far as I'm concerned, there's absolutely nothing superfluous in this show. It all needs to be there and yes, that includes the voice mails. This is my favorite musical so perhaps I'm quite biased but putting aside my personal affection for the show, I really believe that only the complete original cast recording will truly satisfy."
3,Not what i expected,"Being a total RentHead, I looked up RENT online. ""The Best of RENT"" came up. I checked it out, and I found that it is not the ""best of Rent."" Yes, there are some good songs on this CD, but some of the songs aren't that great, in my opinion. There are some of the greatest songs missing, such as ""Goodbye, Love"", and there are some songs that should not be on it, such as ""Will I.""I'm not saying it's bad or anything, I'm just saying that it's missing some key elements that make RENT so incredible."
4,Some important pieces missing,"The first thing that struck me is that Benny's big number (You'll See) is missing, leaving Taye Diggs represented by only a few spoken lines. ""Tango: Maureen"" (though it was not one of my favorites to begin with) is also shorter than I remember from the movie.But the most glaring omissions to me are ""Over the Moon"" and ""Your Eyes""--after all, for Maureen and for Roger respectively, those compositions are the culminations of their artistic lives! And don't get me wrong, I love Stevie Wonder, but his remix of ""Seasons of Love"" added nothing for me to the beauty and grandeur of that pivotal song.I am glad to have this, because I loved the movie and wanted the comparison--but maybe I should have waited til I had the money for the 2 CD set of the original Broadway cast..."
5,Forget regret or life is yours to miss,"after one of my friend basically forced me to buy this cd. i basically fell immediately in love with the catchy tunes. songs like ""tango maureen"" and ""today for you"" will have you up and dancing. my favorite songs include ""life lines"" and ""la vie bohem"" my parents did not like the show, so its more towards a younger crowd, id say children of the 80's, but other then that id still recomend it to anyone."
2,Pass if you own the 2-CD set,"Disappointed.That's what I was when I listened to this disc. If you took the original soundtrack, eliminated ALL the dialogue interspersed between songs, then re-mixed the Stevie Wonder ""Seasons of Love"" cut, this is what you'd have.Save your money for tickets to the show...."
4,I think it pretty good....,I do not have the 2 cd set. I didn't want to pay the money. I am really glad I bought the highlights. It has all the major songs. Well put together and I enjoy it very much.
2,gag.,"i despise this. there is absoluetly no point of listening to this, for you are missing out on ALL of jonathan larsons creation- and it isn't fair to the listener OR the creator. i woudln't waste my money on this. if anything, give it as a present, or as sort of an INTRODUCTION to RENT, but bits and pieces of the magic just is wrong. even if it claims to be ""the best of rent""- i disagree, the BEST of rent is jonathan larsons creation in its entirety."
3,"A little more RENT, please!","I love RENT. The Best of RENT is well recorded, well sung, great cast, et cetra, et cetra. The complaint I have, as I believe many other do, is that some of the best songs were cut. No Happy New Year, none of the voicemail or tune-ups. I would recomend springing for the entire CD. You'll end up buying it anyway when you discover your favorite song isn't included on the Best Of..."
5,TR-300,Awesome speakers for the price!!!Very clean design and nicely built. If you really want deep low end consider getting a subwoofer.
3,Spinning a shoegaze web,"It seems like the Mean Red Spiders are clinging to the early 90's shoegaze ethic, yet that's not necessarily a bad thing, quite refreshing actually. The vocals straddle in between the hazy drone of Hope Sandoval and Miki Berenyi of Lush. After the bouncy Sundays-tinged opener 'First And Only', the album strays through shoegaze territory. Just think bands where the riffs aren't totally drowned-out by feedback/noise (Pale Saints, Adorable, and Revolver) meeting the slow twangy dream-pop of Mazzy Star, Drugstore or Mojave 3. Along the way, the sound touches on several check-points in between, from the spacey minimalism of Spacemen 3 and sonic rock of Mogwai's debut, to the experimental tendencies of The Flaming Lips and latter period Stereolab. The Mean Red Spiders cover quite alot of ground on 'Still Life Fast Moving', detached, dreamy, and enchanting."
2,"""Minor"" problem","Great idea. But a BIG design flaw. When you wear it the flashlight points WAY too high. And there's NO WAY to aim it lower, aside from wearing the band on your nose."
3,Just wait for the movie,"First off, I've been a Punisher fan for years. I bought this book the first day it hit the shelves and read it in one night. I was pleased with the updated version of the Punisher myth. The author has done a good job modernizing and fleshing out the story. The book was well written and fast paced. However, it starts out a little slow and lacks any real character development. One thing that bothered me was the complete lack of character descriptions. Overall, the book had sort of a rushed feel, like they just wanted to get it on the shelves before the movie. I really woundn't recommend this book unless your a diehard fan."
4,The Punisher delivers,"The Punisher, in stark contrast, to one reviewer, is not a one dimensional character. Because Frank Castle has lost everything, we want to know what happens to this person. It's what has kept us reading through Daredevil, Spider-man, Batman, Superman, and Hellboy. And Frank castle is more of a superhero than any of the before mentioned, because he wages a war on crime, not on supervillans but on crime itself. It's amazing that after 20+ years ,this phenomial character has survived the mafia, Tombstone, and the everlasting battle by censorship to put Frank castle in an early grave..."
2,Save your Money and Go to the Library,"Not worth the money. I heard about this book through a review and thought it would be great. I should have went to a book store and looked at it before I bought it. Most of it is common sense, so it wasn't any help."
4,A book worth buying - for yourself and your children!,"This is an enjoyable book with little tidbits to teach your children and yourself, as time goes by.I would suggest this for people with and without children.:-)"
5,It should be required reading for every parent!,"I recommend this book to every parent, teacher, etc- Parents (95% of them) are not teaching BASIC character building and manners elements to their children anymore! - Our kids are the future and look at the way the world is now! Why must bad manners be acceptable behavior?- It is up to the parents to teach manners and set an example- If we start now it could change our country!!!!!WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE! The world does not revolve around our lives and our children, our beliefs and our standards- We all need to learn how to get along with eachother and deal with how everyone is different... and respect one another! Manners is something EVERY child needs to know! What has happened to this Country?....or WORLD for that matter?!!!!!) Parents Unite and make a difference! Buy this book and teach your children how to act! ( you may even learn a lot yourself! I KNOW I DID!)"
3,Can be useful,"First the positive. This book has a lot of ideas about manners, teaching manners. There is enough in this book to fill up a years worth of lessons (obviously).The problems with this book is that many of the manners are broken down into tiny tiny parts and these parts are spread through out the book. For example, it might teach you how to address men (Mr.) one day and then a week later teach you how to address women who are married (Mrs.)This gives it a feeling of being disorganized because each part of a manner is broken down and it is spread through out the book, rather than being in one place.If you are considering buying this book I'd suggest this is one you want to look at and see if it provides what you want in a manner you can use.The children and I refer to this book but for the most part it sits on the shelf unusued."
2,Disorganized,"I bought this book on a recommendation and was disappointed. Most of the content is decent, but it is poorly laid out and not user friendly."
4,belongs on every parents bookshelf,"I like this book mostly because it is 365 days of tips, without dates. You can pull it out any time. I like to bring it out when dinner is over because that's when all the days activities have already been discussed. Then we reference something relative to something that day. It's a good book for all ages. Some are so short & common sense that you'll read several in one day. In any case, the fact that they are so short is another reason this book really works- you can get to them all eventually, and repeat again.RECOMMENDED FOR ALL FAMILIES"
1,Great china- but don't buy it here,"This is beautiful, high quality china from a lovely elegant, timeless design make by Mikasa. But, don't buy it here on Amazon like I did, or you'll end up with more pieces of china than you want- they had *no* cushioning material in the box and it arrived smashed. Multiple boxes, mind you, including the ""replacement"" shipments for the smashed ones, so this was no one-time fluke. Buy it, but buy it elsewhere."
4,"Good DVD, but Amazon description is wrong.","This DVD is just what the title says. Three of the best games from the Bengals 2009 AFC North Championship season. Nothing more.Amazon says it includes a 5+ hour bonus disc of the 2009 HBO's Hard Knocks season. Wrong! No disc. I complained. Amazon sent me another DVD, again no bons disc. Amazon needs to take this ""bonus disc"" out of their description.Also the DVD box says follow the Bengals through training camp...? None of that footage is included either.Still, the games are great. Every play from these three games are included. No commercials and most of the time between plays (huddles, etc.) is omitted. Makes the game go very fast!A Bengals fan should still buy it to re-live what was a pretty positive season. How often have the Bengals gone 6-0 in their division!! Who Dey!"
1,Another release with problems...,"I have had a lot of expectations from this concert just to see that the disk is not played by the Toshiba HD-DVD even with the latest 2.0 firmware, same problem as with their other release, Die Fledermaus. I am more than sure that Opus Arte has not targeted the XBox 360 players with these releases (appears to work on that player) so I wonder on why no one in their QA tried to play it in a Toshiba before rushing the disk out in the market.From what I can see the only advantage from the regular DVD would be the TrueHD; if you don't have the gear to decode that simply buy the regular version coming with Dolby 5.1 and save yourself money and the time required to return the box back to Amazon."
3,It's a good start...,"Well, I have to say that this one will be big (at least in the dance music community.) I like the single, but dislike the remixes on this album! They seem all too repetitive and poorly arranged...I didn't enjoy the CD too much. There needs to be a variety of songs. However, if Robbins plans on releasing a full length album by Reina, I would definitely buy it!!! Her voice is stellar and she'll go far, if she goes with the right people.Support her music!"
5,Ohhh My God!,this is like the best song I have ever heard. I am like omg! Like reina is like sooooo cool. totally. BYEZZZ Hehe This is like sooooooo cool.
2,WHATEVER,"You think that a CD single with remixes from Jonathan Peters should be good but no, the remixes are dull, slow, not danceable and have no energy. The dub is BORING and no vocals, I mean HELLO. The lyrics are good and her voice is great but why so dull and bad mixes."
1,10 stars for the Radio Mix only,"The other mixes are lame, boring and have no energy at all. The dub is the worst."
3,Sad,Both movies are really sad and make up feel for the little boy who is a man in the second movie. I cried my eyes off in the first movie.
1,Good Movies,A friend recommended Christmas Shoes. I loaned the DVD back to them as they had no idea that the Christmas Blessing was a sequel.we all enjoyed them very much
3,Cute story for kids who enjoyed the movie,"My 2 year old son is completely obsessed with this movie (Robots). It was quite old when he first saw it, so coming by anything related to the movie is tough nowadays - but thanks to Amazon, I found this old book in great shape. Its a *really* truncated version of the story obviously, and I can read it to him in about 3 minutes right at bedtime but he loves it and loves telling me the names of each character as we go through the pages. The story basically follows the first 15 or 20 minutes of the film and has lots of big images that the little kids love. Very happy with this purchase."
2,Doesn't work well with my computer,"After spending many hours reading through the manual, I was unable to transfer video from the camera to my computer. If you have a CD or DVD burner, it is supposed to be possible to transfer video from the camcorder to a CD or DVD. Unfortunately, when I tried to do this, Sony's software kept prompting me to insert a CD into my burner even though there was already one in there. I could not get around this problem, and never was able to transfer video from the camera. Also, if you want to transfer video from the camcorder to your hard drive, think again. Sony's software package will strip your audio, add its own soundtrack, and shuffle your video images around for artistic effect. I could not believe that there was no way to transfer video, as is, to the hard drive. I have returned the camera, very frustrated."
4,I've had mine for 9 months now...,"This is a great camera for filming! I love the size, the oh-so-easy-to-use lcd touch panel (nifty) and the auto-focus is not so bad. Of course, it takes pictures also, but keep in mind that the main purpose for this gadget is FILMING! It takes good enough videos with the memory stick, great sound!Not so great pictures at night, but wonderful images during the day.I recommend it."
4,Very nice,"I just bought this camera, at first I was a little scheptical, cause I read on some reviews that it was kind of dificult to transfer the movie to your pc and then to record it on a DVD.I bought it anyway, the camera is small, easy to use and has very nice features. Some people also said the image was washed out, I've had two minidv camcorders prior to this one, a sony and a canon, and I can tell the image, colors and brightness are the same quality as the others I've had.Transfering video and audio to my pc was very easy, I used a firewire cable and a popular program to capture it and then to burn it on a DVD, very simple. Photos taken with this camera are not bad at all, (of course you cannot compare with photos taken with a megapixel digital still camera).I gave it four stars just because I haven't used all the features on the camera, but I can surely recommend this camera for anyone who wants an easy to use and very high quality video camera."
4,Nice Mini-DV Camcorder - Bad Still Picture,"Realy it is a very powerfull Mini-DV camcorder but:Positive Points:Video Quality = HighVideo Resources, like effects, editing,etc.= HighBattery duration = High (I will not buy other one)Dummie mode operation = Very CoolNegative Points:Poor quality images when you take pictureBe careful to not loose the CD with Installation software, because you will not find this on the internet (Picture Package. If you have this software, please send to me at juliofabio@yahoo.com). (Windows XP all ready have the driver);OBS:Unfortunatelly I lost the remote control+ AV Cable (I still looking for it on the internet)."
4,Great miniDV camera,"I just needed a small camcorder for making video game movies and this fits that. My laptop recognized it right away. Transfer is good and I have not had any problems with this DV Camcorder. The only complaint that I do have is the touch screen. I prefer actual buttons, but the camcorder is still easy to use."
5,Great family camera with night vision,"Small compact camera, easily fits into your hand. I got it two weeks ago.Whos it for: Family, fun, party filming. Quality is great for a small camera.Pros:-Sharp Image - Steady shot.-Night Vision - great for Paris Hilton style home movies ;)-Easy use - record, rewind, watch. Easy mode helps out the technologically challeneged.-Interracts easily with the computer-Hooks up easily to my Sony DVD-R PlayerCons:-No light back up for dark areas (Night Vision substitutes for that) Flash attachment piece is available from Sony.-Pictures feel like 1 meg shots. If you want great quality pictures - I would recommend 5meg Sony Cybershot photo camera instead.I would recommend to read the manual to use this camera for its full potential. A lot of hidden features. I generally use this camera for family movies and for catching action at parties. I am glad I got this small camera! Email ayevdo@yahoo.com for any specific Q's!"
4,Amazing Television,"This Television is spectacular, I bought one a few days ago and can say that I am extremely satisfied with it. The colors are rich and vibrant and the picture quailty is superb. Of course it does not compare to the quality of the WEGA's, but for this price, it's hard to beat."
3,"Cord snapped in half, terrible customer service","I've had this charger for 9 months now. Loved it until one day the power cord completely snapped in half. I called customer service, for 3 entire hours, kept getting ""busy at the moment"" recording. Tried different options for ""technical help"", same recording, for ""customer service"", same recording. Finally I asked to speak to ""attendant"", she told me all of the customer service reps were busy and to call back later. Left 2 more messages, no reply. Tried the 'attendant' and she had blocked my number!!!!! Finally got so mad, I left an angry message demanding my money back and they finally called back to offer me a check. Ridiculous."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR SONY LAPTOPS & NO SUPPORT,"I own four Sony laptops of different models and I had planned on buying several of the ReTrak charging units for business computers. The tip provided for the Sony computers will NOT WORK. I tried moving the tip around in one of the laptops and it begins to make a connection but the connection will not make contact and will not charge the laptops. I also have an HP laptop and the tip for the HP works OK. So, if you own a Sony laptop, DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT, IT WILL NOT WORK. When you call tech support, you will only get a recording telling you that they ""are busy at the moment"" and will ask you to leave a message. I have left three messages in the past two weeks and I am still waiting for a call back."
2,It crashed my laptop,"As soon as I plugged this powercord to my Dell Laptop, it went into safe mode and it took me several hours to restore it. I think that there might be a memory chip inserted by Dell so the laptop would not accept any power supply cord not manufactured by Dell."
2,Lasted a little over a year,The removable power cord became jammed after 6 months and would not release. Thankfully i had an old printer cord that would plug into it. The part that plugs into the computer ripped off because the cord is sooo flimsy. Im suprised it lasted as long as it did. The plugs don't stay on the cord well either. I would have given it 3 stars if it was cheaper. I would only recommend this if it was under 20 dollars shipped.
1,Junk,"When my adapter for my Compaq laptop started going south, I looked online for a replacement. I shied away from the cheap adapters because of warnings from other customers that they broke too quickly. After shopping, I settled on this adapter which I got for ~60 bucks. It's a piece of junk. It is less durable than those cheap adapters and after only four months of use it is not rechargin unless I bend the wire in the absoutely perfect position.I could have gotten 15 of the cheap adapters and bet that at least one will work better than this turkey."
4,Great So Far!,"After my daughter's AC charger for her Toshiba laptop came apart at the connector tip, I found exactly what I was looking for . . . a universal charger with retractable cables. The retractable cable is great for travel yet easily expands to the desired length without the clutter of unwanted cable. It reminds me of that shampoo commercial: no more tangles."
3,Incoherent execution of play,"I've been playing adventure games since the late 1980s. Background graphics are fairly nice and detailed. I didn't like how the main character moves, he acts like a robot, quite stiff. Now the most frustrating point of this game: difficulty of puzzles vary too drastically, like heaven and hell. 99% of the puzzles are so easy that you just have to click and click and done. The bomb comes dropping down on you when the few occasions that the puzzles are simply unsuitable for adventure games, instead more appropriate for a college calculus or algorithms course. How many of you can solve a Rubik's Cube? I don't want to give out the plot of the game, but if you answer yes to the question, then by all mean get this game."
3,pretty good,"This is a great game to spend a Saturday on. Its very short but the graphics are really good. Your character does move way to slow and the dialog can get pretty boring at times. I mostly like the puzzles, some were a challenge and to me the best. If you want action this game is not for you. If you like to take things slow and relax then buy this game."
3,Female Juvenille Deliquents,"Basically if you liked ""Reform School Girls"" you'll alsolike Jailbird Rock...Very much alike.Bad girls,Bad wardens, and especially Bad acting!But that's why I liked it!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book for one particular song, ""Under The Bamboo Tree"" and while it is listed as being included, only the chorus is. None of the music or lyrics of the verses."
1,"For Love of The Game, movie soundtrack","greatly disappointed in music selected for movie soundtrack, nothing like the great songs I heard from mid to end of movie. Don't buy."
1,Any CD that can't provide sample tracks must be a dud,I expect to be able to listen to at least something of what I'm buying. Obviously this CD is so under par that doing so would result in a no sale. Enough said!
4,Good,"I thought so. I bought this soundtrack ..., and I didn't expect much out of it, but I must say, I got my money's worth and more! Okay, you might say, so it's worth two bucks, is it worth 9 at Amazon?The answer is, it depends on your musical taste. This soundtrack has a wide variety of genres and performers, from Roy Orbison to Steely Dan to Jennifer Day to Semisonic to K-Ci and JoJo. It all seems to flow together though, the CD has a definate sense of continuity. BUT. If you want something fast-paced and exciting, this album is not for you.So, good relaxing music, espcially the classical track at the end.~C~"
4,looking for a song and artist,WHEN KEVIN COSTNER AND KELLEY PRESTON MEET FOR A SECOND TIME AND END UP WALKING AND TALKING THERE IS A SONG THAT IS SUNG BY A FEMALE ARTIST. I CAN'T FIND THE SONG ON THE SOUNDTRACK AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY. CAN ANYONE TELL ME THE TITLE OF THE SONG AND WHO SINGS IT?MEL IN MO.
4,Great cookware,"This is a terrific cookware set and the stainless look compliments our kitchen very well. It is relatively heavy, but retains heat very well. Is dishwasher safe, however it cleans so easily that I have never taken advantage of that feature. One disadvantage is the size of the frypans. Even though I cook mostly for 2, both fry pans are too small to be useful. I rarely use them. Instead I use the 5 qt saute pan which is oversize for the purpose most of the time. I would have preferred a 12"" frypan instead of the 8"" and 10"" skillets."
4,So far so good,"Purchased while discounted to about 100. So far I am very happy. They cook well, clean up easy. The domed lids really work.Even manages scrambled eggs without sticking.Of course these are non-stick and should be used at lower temps, no cranking it up to 11. They are doing fine in the dishwasher too.I have them only a month or so , if they mess up in the next year or so I will revise review.OK Fast Forward to 2010.These pots are OK only. The non stick has not lasted as well as I had hoped, the frying pans were tossed at least a year or so ago and the pots have NOT stood up to the dishwasher.On the good side, they have not flaked or scratched up to much put they are just not great and are ready to be replaced. Of course I think a lot less of this brand now."
3,songs included...,"The Marvelous Toy * Balloon-Alloon-Alloon * Peas Porridge Hot * Hot Cross Buns * Polly-Wolly-Doodle * The Green Grass Grew All Around * I've Got Sixpence * The man On the Flying Trapeeze * The Riddle Song * The Thing That Isn't There * It Ain't Gonna Rain No More * There's a man in China * London Bridge * It's Raining, It's Pouring * Take Me Out To the Ball Game * This Old Man * the Muffin Man * Ten Little Indians * John Jacob Jingle heimer Schmidt * Row, Row, Row Your Boat * The Sidewalks of New York * My Bonnie * Bicycle Built for Two * You Are My Sunshine*and others...."
1,Childrens Song Book-Received with 16 Missing Pages,"I bought this book to play some of my childhood favorites to my granddaughter.The index contains some of my favorites,BIG DEFECT is that pages 9-24 are MISSING!It's impossible to play songs without the music and lyrics!I don't recommend this book."
1,From the eyes OF a Lakota,"I will try and refrain from being too harsh here, however...I feel this needs to be said from someone who actually knows something about these things.(I am Oglala Lakota) First off, if you want to know the TRUTH about Lakota spirituality, don't buy a book from some European out to make a quick buck. This book, as well as his others are filled with pieces from this and that, speculation and cliche' and has little to nothing to do with the truth. (The Lakota people do not, nor ever have had ""Shamans"") This type of book not only serves to perpetuate the disintigration of our sacred ways, but it also dishes out lies, misconceptions, and other non-truths. I highly suggest that this, and books like it, not be supported so that those who are truly searching, won't have to be loaded down with junk, before they find the true treasure."
1,Disappointing...,"Mr. Meadows is known for his ""Shamanic"" genre writing, though this is the first book of his I have read. I wanted to explore some of the history of earth based spirituality, and with that expectation found this book very disappointing. Mr. Meadows paints incredibly huge strokes, covering thousands of years of spiritual life, shoe horning it into the Medicine Wheel, and doing so in the space of 90 pages. He makes statements that begin like Aristotlian proof theorems, and spin into grandiose New Age spiritual idealisms. His descriptions of what ""Amerindians"" (now I am really getting ill) believed or didn't believe no doubt has Native Americans everywhere rolling on the floor or in their graves. Meadows tries to do way too much and is ill equiped to handle his subject matter, both academically and poetically."
3,Good,The product arrived in a timely fashion. Although I have used it only once and the handle has begun to chip already.
5,supernatual book,Just received it and it was in great condition. I shows that the condition stated online hold up in practice.
2,Way Too Small,This thing is not nearly big enough to load many leaves into. You would spend more time carrying and unloading the leaves unless you have a very small yard.
3,Not a bad bag,"I got this just in time. A recent storm took all the leaves off of our trees. This bag is too small, especially for dry leaves. With wet leaves, the bag was easily managed. Handle in the middle just causes leaves to spill out when you pick it up.If the bag was twice the size and the handle was moved forward, this would be a great deal."
1,leaf collector,This was due to arrive March 1-4 and it has never arrived. I had forgotten that I even ordered it until having it appear in the review column.
1,Not worth the money,"Disappointed in the quality of the tarp. Very thin, grommets started to tear after one use as a boat cover. Not worth the money. Go for a heavier tarp or a different brand."
3,Decent tarp,Good tarp however grommets are not very strong and tarp tore around many of them from wind and tightening of rope.
1,"Thin, only good for light duty","Tried to use this tarp to cover my boat. The grommets tore easily without much tension. The reinforcing rope along the perimeter is not even rope or cord, very weak and ripped apart easily. The tarp itself is thin, good for one season at best. Buy the 10 mil. Worth the extra money."
3,"Thin, but did last for one year","I used this tarp to cover the roof of our travel trailer.. I didn't have high hopes for it lasting long when we first put it on because some of the grommets started to rip loose immediately, but have to say, we were very surprised that it actually did end up holding up for a year.. Last week after a big wind storm, it ripped apart so obviously it had worn more than I realized, but for $20, it did the job for a year.. Not bad.. It really isn't very thick, though, so if you need something heavy duty, this isn't the right tarp. the color is nice, which is why I bought it. The brown blended in with the trailer, but we decided the color wasn't worth the thinner thickness, so we're replacing it with a thicker one."
2,Not so thick,"I purchased the tarp in order to protect the bottom of my soft round pool. It did the job for as long as the pook was out, mind you we didn't move the pook around or dragged it an which way. Now let me point out that i's not as thick as one would think, it's actually so thin that you can actually see right thru at certain places."
1,Don't buy it.. It is old and not interesting at all! Buy the Oxford Picture dictionary instead,Don't buy it.. It is old and not interesting at all! Buy the Oxford Picture dictionary instead.I thought that the new OPD would be much enhanced however it was so disappointing and not interesting at all
3,Wheel Magic lacks power,"I tried Wheel Magic on some silver painted rims with rotor rust and brake dust on them. The product worked OK, but required scrubbing with a stiff brush. The rotor rust did't come off completely, even after several applications of WM. Not overly impressed, but maybe I was expecting too much."
5,Great Collection,Purchased this for a gift but I have had opportunity to hear this. It is a good mixture of all of his great hits and a few I had not heard.
5,Jeffrey Osborne Ultimate Collection,Ultimate Collection is the perfect title! All the songs are great and take me back 20+ years each time I listen to the CD! It's well worth the price.
4,Greatest love affair,"This CD would have gotten 5 stars from me if the ""Greatest Love Affair"" was on it. Even though it was a hit for George Benson I still see it as a hit for Jeffre Osborne."
1,Wrong labels on songs with wrong Artist,"The CD has Jeffrey Osborne's face but that's about it. The songs are labeled totally different when the CD is loaded onto computer. The artist shows up as Smokey Robinson and the songs are labeled as one of Smokeys such as ""Tears of a Clown"". It is weird. I almost didn't listen to it but noticed when I played one that it was Jeffrey's song. Now, when the song plays on my iPhone it has Smokey's face and the song is one of Smokey's titles. Weird."
5,A Voice Like Cognac...,"Oh, Jeffrey, the memories! The first time I heard the smooth sounds of Jeffrey Osborne, I was attending a concert in 1983 (yikes!). I was instantly hooked. I must admit I have a penchant for the throaty, mellow tones of some of the older R&B artists. Jeffrey Osborne's sound is reminiscent of a finely aged bourbon -- soothing, sensual, and incredibly smooth. His ballads are just that - aching love songs, not an artist attempting to hold the note until you start looking for a truss. But the one song in this collection that made me an instant Osborne fan is ""Stay With Me Tonight"". A little faster paced than some of his larger hits, but one that will reach down in the pit of your stomach and make you feel...well..let's put it this way. Men, are you looking for an excellent make-out cd? Turn this track on and she'll be putty! This is one artist that deserves a very loud ""Bravo!"" Play it again, Jeffrey..."
5,I am so glad this has come out,"As a composer, I have worked with and for many talented people. Jeffrey Osborne is at the top of any list I would make for people of amazing talent and ability. I am proud to have written both ""Stay with me tonight"" and ""The Borderlines"" for him.As an aside, I wrote ""Stay with me tonight"" on a sofa (former Labelle vocalist) Nona Hendryx had given to me because she said there was no place to sit in my music/living room. My thought was to create a song inspired by the Talking Heads (who I'd toured with as a keyboardist just prior to working with Jeffrey) but with Jeffrey's vocal style in mind.I hope this collection allows people to hear some of the best of Jeffrey's past work as we all look forward to his new and upcoming projects."
5,Long awaited Hits Set Is Here,"It's hard to believe this is the first compilation of Osborne's solo years. Where have you been A&M? Adding some ringers from his LTD years, this covers his Arista hits as well. What's missing? Maybe ""Soweto"" which did chart in 1986. Only 2 of Osborne's A&M albums are in print. All in all this is solid and essential. Let's hope someone else comes through and restores the rest of his catalog."
4,Nice uplight for indoor trees,Works well to light up a dark corner and add atmosphere to my bamboo trees. Would recommend for a small space
5,Full filled expections,"This light was exactly what I had searched the stores for, and couldn't find. Very happy with it. Provides just the amount of accent needed."
1,"Like the product, sent wrong color",I love up lights and this is one I like...but I ordered gloss white and they sent me brushed nickle or silver colored...all three of them
4,Catchy-Hook Filled Pop Songs,"I took a chance on this CD based on the other reviews. It's a great CD that re-kindles the lost ""pop"" sound of the late 1970's (in my opinion). I remember when pop had hooks that you'd remember only after one listening...to me this CD fills that void. I love it and there are only 2 songs I don't care for. Highly recommended for pop fans that like really catchy hooks you won't forget!"
4,a great surprise,"I adore this cd. I discovered it through my boyfriend who's a DJ. he played it and I loved it. It's smooth, with good harmony and moody melody. i recommend it highly!"
4,my name is augustina and i got this album in august!,I just got this cd as an early birthday present! Every song is enjoyable and I love the textured quality and the excellent production. I intend to buy the other albums as well!! Ken Andrews produced it and provides backing vocals and additional instrumentation. Overall a good pop/rock record.
3,Go for women,Jeremy has a leprechaun friend. Together they go on a sex trip when Jeremy is shrunk and teleported to the hard drive of his laptop. Don't watch this movie with the eye of a critic. If you like women and Tane McClure (female lead) get this movie. The other female leads are Gabriella Hall and Landon Hall.
5,More than hunting,"""Seasons & Days"" bears the subtitle ""A Hunting Life,"" but that might have been more accurate if it were simply ""Life."" Thomas McIntyre is one of the most intelligent writers we have today, a master of the insightful - and frequently very amusing - essay. All of these essays revolve around hunting, but they are also meditations on the human experience. And beautifully written!"
3,"Cuts Threads, hard to clean","Needed to thread some thick-wall rigid conduit for a project. This does the trick, at least for 1/2 inch. Having a coupling for the two pieces of handles rather than having them thread directly together, or the coupling being secured to one is a bit cumbersome.My biggest issue is the construction of the dies tends to hold on to the cuttings, and at least in the 1/2 inch and smaller dies the spaces in the dies are very tight to get in to to clean the cuttings out.Do yourself a favor and use this with a real vice with non-slip pipe jaws, or you'll just end up fighting with a twisting pipe, especially near the ends of the cuts."
5,WHAT AN ALBUM!!,"When the history of British Rock is written, it will be seen as criminal if this album (and indeed ""Vigilante"" and ""Wings of Heaven"" that followed it) is excluded from such a list. Magnum have always had the ability to evoke powerful images and emotions through the joint efforts of the band's superb musicianship, Tony Clarkin's exquisite lyrics and Bob Catley's heartfelt singing. He is seen more as a storyteller than a straight vocalist, as his voice perfectly captures the mood and emotion that each song asks of him. Epic songs ""How Far Jerusalem?"", On A Storyteller's Night"" and the excellent ""Les Morts Dansant"" sit alongside pop-rock number such as ""Two Hearts"", ""Just Like An Arrow"" and the under-rated ""Steal Your Heart"". Coupled with the gorgeous piano-ballad ""The Last Dance"", this is an album who's delights are savoured time and time again with each new playing. Also, the album cover by Rodney Matthews is superb too."
5,This is the book I have been waiting for!!,I ordered Linda and Opie's book after taking several of their classes. I am a huge Linda and Opie fan and this book is no exception. The pictures and text are clear and helpful. This book is a great support to someone who has taken their classes but it also has lots of new ideas and tips. It is a must for anyone interested in metal working. Great ideas and cool projects abound in this gem!
2,Kinda kitchy,"This is probably my fault for not investigating more, but this book is full of little kitchy kind of junkie looking craft projects for jewelry and small folk art projects - not my style. I was looking more for a metal craft sculpture kind of book, this definately is NOT that. I'm sure there are some good ideas on how to treat metals to get a look that you want that might be useful to me but otherwise, not useful at all."
3,Not Your Usual McNabb,"Fans of Ian McNabb will be surprised at this effort, but also very pleased. The CD is almost completely acoustic and has none of the edge and pop riffs McNabb has on other solo works. The only remnants from his Icicle Works days on this CD is McNabb's familiar voice. The lyrics are pure McNabb, however; tongue firmly in cheek. The music is very mellow. Slip your cardigan on and pour a tall glass of brandy. True McNabbheads will love this one, though. It's just not what you would expect.Those looking for a continuation of Icicle Works might be better off skipping this one and buying his other solo CD's like Merseybeast and Head Like A Rock. Both are awesome with plenty of great songs you will want to play loud."
3,ONLY ONE PAN sold in what I thought was a TWIN pan,"The label on this item (I bought the 8"" open french skillet)says Circulon 2 8"" skillet but it does NOT mean there areTWO skillets .. it is referring to Circulon II."
4,ElMeroMero1DMIA@webtv.net,"Q-VOOO,if you like latino rap like I do,then you'll have to get this album.It has all the top GENTE like,NINO,FROST,PROPER DOS,SLOW PAIN and more!"
4,nice fashion doll,"Job well done by Barbie...doll looks like Kimora. I think the doll may go up in value over many years. Barbie should release a limited edition Oprah barbie doll, they did only ""one"" for Ms. Winfrey some years ago. It would be nice for Barbie to do a Tyra doll as well......just a thought !!!"
4,Fun for grown-ups!,"My sons are young adults now, but we enjoyed Bill Harley's music for children when they were little. While searching for copies of his CDs to introduce a new generation to Bill's music, I came across this CD for grownups. While I prefer his children's music (maybe because Bill himself seems in some ways like he never grew up), his stories are cute and funny and contain elements everyone can relate to. The songs are pleasant and Bill has a warm folksinger's voice. This would be a nice CD for a road trip. I enjoyed the chance to get a little more insight into the life and times of a troubadour who created so many happy moments for us when our children were young."
3,someone's autobiography,"This book was recommended to me to help jump-start my business. It's easy reading, although it seemed I was reading about bankruptcy awfully soon. the author takes you through his career so quickly, there is surely a section or two most people would like to learn more about, but it moves quickly through all the phases the author went through. As for me personally, I couldn't relate to the size or atomsphere of the author's business. Our careers are so different. There were some good basic guidlines I highlighted & may go back to if I feel the need. It seemed more of a mind-set type of book for the self-employed. The author's a little into himself too much!"
1,"If I could, I'd rate it as a zero.","The way the book was written was unusual. Almost anyone can see that. Also, it would be better if there was more info on Digemon."
3,Brickyard Can Be where it ends up.....,"My son received the Brickyard 400 race set for his birthday. He was very excited. The track was fairly easy to put together. It was easy to connect the cars. It was fun racing around the track. All electric race fans know the main problem is keeping your car on the track. The other problem we faced is that the guns used to make the cars go has a very limited range. I've tried to find out where we can buy accelerators with longer wires but have been unsuccessful so far. If this were remedied, this would be an above average to for an 8 year old who enjoys car racing. With the accelerators as they stand, it is only average."
5,must read,"in my 18 years as a diabetic this book is the most readable and enjoyable book that I have read. I am sure that life will be easier for me and my family from now on,"
5,diabetic,"This book realy hits home. It discuses common problems we as diabetics face each day and how they affect our relationships.I gave this book to my wife,parents and in laws to better understand my medical condition. I can recommend the book to all diabetics, and their relatives and friends"
4,Luring a lad,I don't usually do sequenced books of of turn..but now I have to do them all. Another great Nora Roberts
4,Romance Luring a Lady,NORA ROBERTS she knows how to created a Romance novel. The character they are learning to dealing with love in a sentimental or idealized way ; to be able enjoyable there love affair. This lady she has to learn how dealing with events remote from real life in things she has never has to until now!.
3,nora,"This is the second book of the Stanislaskis Brothers,it is a good idea to read the first one,to give the reader more backgroung to the triology.It is a reprint of an earlier edition,so please check that you have not read it before purchase.The book certainly keeps the reader interested in the plot as it is a struggle between the rich and poor imigrants in the usa, like the Americn dream that people from humble backgroud can mix with the prim and proper,a bit out of its league nowadays.A good relaxing read. I read the first 2 books but then I didn;t feel like eeading the rest as it just seemed that the writer was dragging the storyline out too much should have stopped at the 2nd book to keep readers interested in the saga,the same problems that we see with the tv,the first couple of episodes are really interesting but then the interest gets fizzled out.Best to stop when you have a captive audience."
3,Good Read,"Second of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded and gorgeous Ukranian-American family.I liked the hero, but maybe not as much as I expected to from his secondary role in the first book. But the author does a great job of infusing his character with a sexy-gypsy flavor. I really liked the heroine in this one, her relationships with others and discoveries of self. And I loved all the family scenes.Enjoy."
1,Make sure you haven't read this one!,"This is a re-release of a book I read years ago by Nora Roberts. Looking at the release date, you would think it's new. I wasted almost $6 bucks for a book I read before, being someone who hates to read the same book twice. Not a fair thing to do and feel this is a rip off and should be stated by the publishing house, that it is an old book being re-released.I'm giving it one star because I want people to read the review before they purchase it. The story is a four star romance!"
1,LURING A LADY (THE STANISLASKIS),There is no real story about this series of books so I gave them all an extremely low rating and would not recommend them to anybody. I like Norah Roberts but this is one of her series that appeals to me.
3,SUDDEN DEATH review!,Pretty good DIE HARD rip-off has fire marshall Van Damme trying to save his kids and the Vice President from a rouge Secret Service agent who is planning on blowing up the seventh game of the Stanley Cup.The plot is that simple. There really isn't much going on besides that so if you didn't like similiar moves than there probably isn't a whole lot here for you.
3,"Wham, Bam, Thank You Van Damme!",The match of the century: Bad Guy Dressed as The Pittsburg Penguin vs. Van Damme- Magical
3,"AVERAGE VAN DAMME FLICK, BUT, IT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED","A FIRE MARSHAL [VAN DAMME] MUST STOP A SADISTIC MAN FROM BLOWING UP A HOCKEY ARENA. OF COURSE, THIS IS AVERAGE AT BEST. BUT, JUDGING FROM ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS THAT I'VE SEEN CRITICS LIKE LEONARD MALTIN GIVE THIS FILM, THIS IS A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE! IT DOES HAVE GOOD ACTION, EVEN IF THIS MOVIE IS ANOTHER DIE HARD RIP-OFF. VAN DAMME FANS SHOULD LOOK AT THIS ONE IF THEY STILL HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET."
3,"Alright kids, you stay here while I go and save the 20,000 people in this stadium ok. And I have to save the vice president too","And then he goes and plays hockey!Overall I have to say that this flick was one of the stupidest movies ever but the production values are high and the acting is pretty good. Very unusual for a Jean Claude movie. I even remember some classic lines from the hockey announcer. I wouldn't rate this as one of Damme's better movies, but then again, it is really not far off. All in all, this was a fun movie, if you are not over the age of 13."
2,No Widescreen?,"As I am watching this film on OMAX in WIDESCREEN HD, I wonder why it is here on Amazon in a Fullscreen version. Why the difference?"
4,about the movie Sudden death.......,This is one of the best fighting action Van damme movie/film in his whole series of collection. A recommendation for those whom are interested in this genre of movie/films. Enjoy....
2,Solid Action But Its All Been Done Before,Jean cludde Van Damme needs to get a life and start making some rewarding films otherwise his carrer is finnished alongside another falling action star Steven Seagal. Sudden Death has all the good stunts and tough talking dialouge but it suffers from deja vu almost immedinatly after the opening credits. Die Hard And Under Siege this film can often be compared with. Van damme plays a fireman(original instead of a burned out cop or goverment agent)who takes his kids to the Stanley Cup Playoffs where Terroirsts Have taken control of the arena and hold the u.s president captive. The villian is so lame in this film he makes Elmer Fudd look more terifying. The tagline to this film was `Terror Goes Into Overtime` more like Boredom goes into Overtime.
1,"Predictable movie with unmemorable title, of course!","This movie was a total waste of time! The dialogue was weak, the characters were unbelievably false, and, yes, I know, you are supposed to suspend your belief in these type of movies. But how far must you go? There is one real unbelievable scene where this idiot kid of Van Damme's has no common sense and waits at the stadium when everyone else has left, with a BOMB of course, and doesnt leave because he's SCARED! Also, the script must have been thought up on someone's lap on a plane trip, with ""realistic"" phrases from announcers like ""Scratch my back with a hacksaw!"" This movie is definitely a crowd pleaser for anyone that has an I.Q. a bit above 25."
2,Sudden Death Looks Good Right Now,"This was definitely not the best movie I've ever seen. The truthis that it's bad. So bad that I could hardly watch it. I got thismovie because it involved hockey, and I'm a huge fan. It was notworth it- maybe, just maybe for action fans. But not for an averagewatcher...the action was really cheesy for my taste...and onlya few lines grabbed my interest. I know action movies don'thave to be Oscar worthy...but this was a far cry from anythingcinematic. Don't waste your time."
1,"Typical, stupid action movie","This is 1 of the worst movies I have ever seen! Some of theaction sequences are ok but the plot is such a has been. There are so many good action movies invovling terrorists, but this 1 is a failure! And for Van Dame? ... After seeing this, I never want to see another one of his movies. The villian is so lame & weak. It was really pathedic how bad he was developed. Trust me, DO NOT see this film! There are action movies 50 times bettter!I don't normally keep a worst movie list, but this is one of my worst!"
5,An Entertaining Movie!,"One of the best Van Damme movies that I have seen. Van Damme plays the role of our heros very effectively. Powers Boothe is a very good villain. I also liked Powers Boothe cast of heavies. Of course they were no match for Van Damme. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat until it's conclusion. The hockey game championship atmosphere was also very effective. I also enjoyed the ending with Van Damme rescuing the Vice- President. Buy the movie,it is surprisingly good."
4,Icy terrorist-hostage game,"Maybe the match between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Chicago Blackhawks just didn't seem to have enough action at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh on ESPN, Jean Claude Van Damne plays a fire inspector who attends a Stanley Cup game when he encounters the terrorist who takes the vice-president hostage. His kids are also held hostage. He has until the end of regulation time before the terrorist bombs the arena with 16,000 screaming fans (not in panic but cheering on the Pens) for the Stanley Cup. Maybe next year, a senator will be kidnapped and held hostage at the Avalanche-Panthers finals."
4,Classic 90's Action,"Great action movie! Pretty much Die Hard in a hokey arena! Still great action, good cast. Great action scenes and plot...dad out to save his kids against terrorists. Can't get much better!"
4,I liked it,Good story about a person thrust into a culture completely different from his own. Lewitt is an excellent writer.
5,The scent brings back memories of younger days,"My neck was starting to have the wrinkled, mature look about 5 years ago but since I've used this product I see a remarkable difference and my skin is so smooth. I spray it on after makeup and at bed time. I've also used it as a ""pick-me-up"" during long days."
2,OK but bugs slip through the wires,Its ok but for anything smaller than a fly slips right through the little space between the wires.
4,Good Algebra Book,"This is a good algebra book. It did NOT have hyperbolas that are not centered on the origin, but it should have. The last section on probability and statistics had confusing exercises with answers that didn't seem right. However, it is certainly easier than Elaine Hubbard and Ronald D. Robinson, ""Intermediate Algebra: A Graphing Approach"", which I read earlier this year. Exercises in Blitzer's text are easier than in Hubbard's.I realize that there are newer editions available, and I don't know what they're like."
3,"Size runs big, leather creased","I love the look and the price, but for me the shoe runs almost one size bigger. I tried to remedy this with an insole. The leather creased dramatically after one wear, possibly because it is too big for my feet."
4,Packed full of information!,"Although this book could be updated since it was originally published, it still offers tons of great information for the biz traveler!There are insider stories that only a biz traveler or travel staff would know. These stories will help you throughout your travels.There are several website mentioned in the book (and another reason it should be updated since the web is a constant growing animal!). The websites provide shortcuts to obtaining your travel needs and information.I recommend this book to any biz traveler. I personally found it handy by recognizing several things I could've done better to help me survive on the road (i.e. ever need a copy center in the middle of the night?)."
1,Poor writing destroys the potential of this film,"I saw the trailer to this and was SOOOO excited. It looked to be a really good creepy ride of a film. Once we picked it up (I am forever grateful I got it at a bargain and didn't pay full price for it) we excitedly put it in. Even the talent of such a stellar cast couldn't keep the story in this film from reeking. For example, a nurse, with NO criminal background mind you, not only declares she is better at solving the crime than the actual police, but she is the only one who cares. She disturbs a crime scene and the police........do NOTHING? This just names a few but it was the constant unbelievability of this protagonist that just drove me nuttier than a fruitcake. The actors and actresses, as always, were stellar; the writer however needs to be taken to the woodshed and quietly beat."
5,great series,this book was awesome.the whole series is great.if you love murder mysteries-grab this book.kay hooper is one of my favorite authors
3,How many psychics does it take to change a lightbulb?,"Or in this case, how many do you need in one novel? This one had three, and it was two too many. Hiding suffers from only average writing, one-dimensional characters, and flat, if functional dialogue. The villians weren't particularly compelling, and the solving of the mystery was anti-climatic. But even worse was the treatment of Faith's character at the end. After Ms. Hooper invites the reader to establish an emotional investment in the heroine, she robs the character of her happy ending in a most unsettling, and unbelievable way."
1,Can't believe this book is so popular,"I can not believe that so many of these reviews are positive. I had to read this book for my book club, or I would have stopped reading in the first 50 pages. The fact that it was an easy read and could be finished in a couple of days was its only redeeming quality.The characters were the same characters you'll find in any other airport novel. I think that the author was really reaching throughout the entire book to give them more dynamic personalities, but in my opinion fell short.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and I have a whole bookclub of people who would agree. Instead of discussing this book, we spent the whole meeting trying to come up with future books and kidding the woman who chose this one everytime she suggested another."
3,"Okay, but a little strange","This book was okay, but not as good as ""Stealing Shadows"". Hardly anything made since and the chartacters just weren't endearing. The ending didn't help, how strange. If you are a mystery fan you might enjoy this book. I'm going to start on the third book and hope that it's as good as the first."
4,"Good Mystery, Not So Great Ending...","I liked this book right away. Finding out the connection between Faith and Dinah and about Faith's mysterious past, got me hooked right away. Kane and a larger role for Noah Bishop also added to the interesting characters in this novel.But the ""reason"" behind what happens in the book was a bit lame, as was the ""twist"" ending. Won't ruin the surprise for you but I found it a bit of a stretch.All in all though, worth a read."
3,hiding in the shadows,"i thought this book would provide background info on the two lead detectives, but it didn't. i was disappointed."
4,Well written but...,This book was very well written with a strong mystery. I sort of had a hard time getting into the plot until about page 110. I don't know what happened but after that the pace of the story picked up considerably. I love this series and have already started on book three.Kay Hooper is a new to me and I have totally enjoyed this series. A good read.
2,And I really like Noah Bishop books...,"I've read all of the Noah Bishop books 5+ times and every time I enjoy them. However, that is NOT the case with Hiding in the Shadows. I really didn't like this book at all. Unlike the other Bishop books, this one is not a crime mystery... although it is a mystery just not a very interesting one. It didn't keep my attention and didn't seem to be as put together as her other books.I was most disappointed with this book being that it is in the Shadows Trilogy."
3,Not my favorite in this series,"This is the story of Faith Parker who awakens from a coma and has no memory of her past. The only link to her past has been reported missing. Kay Hooper's novel is well thought out and interesting, but I liked the other two in this series better. Her stories are always unique, but for some reason, this book didn't click with me as well as the other two did. It is worth a read though!"
4,Keeps You Guessing,"When Faith Parker wakes from a long accident-induced coma, she has virtually no memory. She doesn't even remember her friend, journalist Dinah Leighton, who visited her every day at the hospital and who has now disappeared. As bits and pieces of Faith's memory gradually return, never mind that they seem to be someone else's memories, it appears that she was helping Dinah with an investigative piece, but the details have been lost. It also appears that someone was banking on Faith never waking up. As attempts are made on her life, she turns to Dinah's fiance for help. But can he be trusted, especially when it becomes apparent that Faith has some sort of psychic connection to the missing Dinah? This is an elegant little thriller with supernatural overtones, and readily recommended."
1,no no no no no no NO!,"I don't usually hate books, but i hated this one. all i can say is that the heroine didn't know herself so i never got to know her.I loved Kay Hoopers other books in the ""Shadows Trilogy"" and i actually own those other two books, but this one IMO is frustrating."
3,Almost made as a soap opera episode,"I would say that Hiding In the Shadows has a wonderful plot but so much happens to this main character,Faith, that it starts to get kinda cheesey. The trauma that this woman goes through is amazing. Kay Hooper is an amazing writer, but he should really be a tv script writer for soap operas."
3,A Good Read But Slower Than the First Book,"The book was about Dinah, Faith, and Dinah's boyfriend, Kane. You follow them through solving the mystery of what happened to Dinah and why. Dinah watched over her friend when she was in a coma but after Dinah turns up missing, Faith recovers from the coma without her memories. Danger lurks. Faith starts believing she has a limited psychic connection to Dinah. She and Kane use her visions and Dinah's voice in her head to slowly uncover what happened to Dinah and why. The villian aspect was downplayed and the ending was a suprise twist for the two friends which made me think of The Sixth Sense. This book can be read on it's own without reading the first. Noah, a character used in each book, is more of a supporting friend to Kane instead of able to help solve this mystery with his psychic abilities."
5,wonderful,As usual Kay Hooper keeps you on the edge until the end wondering who the bad guy is. You can always speculate but so far it's always a surprise
2,It's good but it didn't sit well with me.,"i adore Kay Hooper's psychic romance novels. I have enjoyed the ""Evil"" series, the ""Shadow"" series, the ""Fear"" Series and the ""Blood"" series and am looking forward to reading more of her amazingly twisted but entertaining and surprising stories in the future. Having said that, I really didn't like this one. It is not so much the story itself as the twist with, revealed at the end, that just irked me. I won't state it here. Let me just clarify - it wasn't a lame ""waking from a dream"" or even a slapped together resolution. She's too good for that. I guess that the resolution just made me uncomfortable. Maybe that a good thing. Maybe that states how strong Hooper's stories and writing is... but for me, this is one of her novels that I'll keep (to keep the series together) but probably never read again - and I am a voracious re-reader. Believe me, it's not a bad story... it just didn't sit well with me in the end."
1,Items received Damaged,Both lamps were received damaged. I immediately sent a message through amazon to let the company know. 4 days later i sent another message since i had heard nothing. The company claimed they never received the first one. Asked me to take Pictures of the damaged lamps which i did and sent them off to the company. Once again nothing. This has to be some of the worst customer service i have ever had with any company. I am still left with the damaged goods and the company is ignoring my messages.
3,It's Great for the Hard Workers,"I have this book , and I feel that it is wonderful for those that are hard working and able to comprehend things quickly. It is hard though for others who are not as quick to comprehend the terms and ideas in this book because they are almost alike the the actual studybook for biology 2 ap~"
4,"Don McLean, some better than others...","This CD has my favorite Don McLean songs. On repeated (non-stop) listening, I find that some of his classics are not as good as I used to think, while others are better than I remembered; and some that I have never heard before are outstanding! Some even seem to pre-date the rock era (which is good)."
5,excellent service,"Item arrived as described - perfect condition, timely manner. Certainly one of the best albums ever produced! I love doing business through Amazon!"
1,horrible cheap and cr*ppy,My friend just got a double eagle m83 and he wanted to test it out on the goggles from point blank. I let him and the goggles shattered. even the outside part that holds the lens cracked the D.E m83 is only 200fps.
4,Saftey Goggles go for Gold!,"The goggles I ordered arrived pretty early, the looked nice on their picture, but looked great when I opened the package. I use the for airsoft, and what i love about these goggles is that they don't fog up so easily un like my previous pair. Unfortunately they still fog up, they are a lil too big, and as for overall comfort, its to comfortable! At the end of the day the goggles are very sturdy, comfortable, and reliable, a great buy for any airsofter. I give it a 8 out of 10."
3,Cheap,"My worst expend of money. But it looks ok for SWAT costumes. There are better options, even my pepakura of halo reach resist the impacts."
2,Does not correspond with ADT 2006,"The material does not correspond with ADT 2006. As you read and start lessons, the book calls for you to push buttons that don't exist and to use commands that don't appear in the menus they say they should. It is definitely not for someone to learn from, only to refresh what one already knows."
4,Best bang for the buck,"I look forward to the updated ""Mastering "" series every time I upgrade Architectural Desktop.Aubin's writings are kind of a clearing of the fog for me. I would hate to have to muddle through the new features without some direction and most of the other publications I've looked into seem very long winded and redundant but the ""Mastering "" books get right to the nuts & bolts.Phil Vanderloo"
1,Awful book. Waste of money and time.,"Author should really stop writing books. I am very used to AutoCAD Bible series books and they are the best books ever. This so-called ""mastering"" is really just a step-by-step description of how author created his simple and ordinary projects, without describing any of the tools or techniques. And it even gets worse! Author is giving you predesigned items(from the CD) and preconfigured tools(also given by the author), without explaining how to create them or why they are even used! All the functionality of Architectural desktop is described in 10% - book is just a waste of paper. It is hard to navigate through the book, you cannot use the book as a reference, even pictures in the book look amazingly unprofessional. So think twice before spending money. I don't like to disappoint the author - but this ""mastering manual"" really sucks. How did it even get Autodesk logo on the cover? I wouldn't put it there..."
3,Project Perfect,"This book shows alot about the history, culture and much more on the country Colombia. It is great for research papers and alot of other projects in school. I recommend this for kids in school and librarys. If you look in librarys there aren't many books on Colombia, but I was lucky to find this!"
2,Hot handles,"I bought this product last week. The interior/outerior surfaces are all good: non-stick, heating fast and easy to clean. However, the steel handels are terrible. It got hot after 5 mins cooking even the temperature is set very low. You can not hold it at all. From their discription, it should be phenolic. When I called Circulon's customer service, they said the steel handels are just like that: it will trnasfer heat. Then why it claimed to be phenolic? So the pan is useless at all, unless your hand/fingers are heat-resistant!!!"
3,CAN NOT BEAT THE RIFLEMAN!,"BRANDED was good over all but You just can not beat THE RIFLEMAN, THE STORIES WERE OK, SOME WERE VERY GOOD AFTER THE MIDDLE OF THESEASON, BUT OVER ALL IT WAS GOOD! IF you like western you might like this one!"
5,LOVE IT!,"We should all be grateful to have all these classic westerns released on DVD where we can watch them at our own leisure when time permits, even though it's not remastered like all the others Gunsmoke, Rawhide etc, it is still a great watch, the story evolves into a complex situation as he becomes an undercover agent for the president, ( kind of an olden day Jack Bauer of 24 ) Chuck Connors is an absolute legend along the likes of James Arness, Richard Boone, Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood, the main thing is just enjoy them for what they are, it's the closest thing to time travel as we are taken back to a time when things were slower and less stressful and had more family time to watch shows like these."
3,broken and disappointed,"Although I enjoyed Branded. . .The second disc was cracked, unviewable, and unreturnable.I'm stuck with a disc I cannot watch, use, or return.I had to go to Fry's Electronics, where I found and purchased both First and Second Seasons for half the price of what I'd paid on line at Amazon. I got both seasons for the price of one. And they are returnable!Next time and every time from now on, I will shop elsewhere before I buy from Amazon. You can't return opened DVD's. How do you know if they are broken until you open it? If I can't return damaged product, sent to me already damamged, what's the point of buying?Anyway, Branded is great. I really liked the show!Picture was pretty good. Wish there was more.R. E."
4,Formidable Western,One fantastic Western. Correct Presentation in B&W. Exciting histories. Done of except other languages and/or Subtitles.
1,"EDITED , CUT episodes. Buyer Beware!","The shows have been edited by about 3-4 minutes each, these are the cut versions seen in syndication. Unacceptable. I wouldn't accept my paycheck missing 15-18% of my money, I'd be unhappy if I bought a book and found that 15% of the pages had been ripped out, so why should I pay $$$ for a DVD missing 15-18% of the footage? Avoid this set and spend your money elsewhere. The same company also released edited GUNS OF WILL SONNET shows, so buyer beware."
1,MISLABELED - DO NOT BUY!!!,"This is mislabeled! It is NOT ""The Complete Second Season"" It is 3 episodes from the first season - Survival, The Vindicator and The Mission.It was my own fault for not completely reading the description - only 130 minutes - HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Not even going to comment on the quality because I don't plan on opening it - I already have season 1. Definately pass on this one at ANY price!"
1,BIG Disappointment,"Robson Arms: The Complete Third SeasonLOVE CORNER GAS. . .REALLY LIKE THE ACTORS IN this series (and Corner Gas) but DEFINITELY DO NOT LIKE THIS SERIES -- NOT family friendly, HEAVY Sexual content, rather depressing. If you like the actors THAN buy CORNER GAS"
3,Translation of English subtitles is terrible,The movie is good even though I thought La Raffe (The Roundup) was a more moving take on the same subject.I saw the movie on DVD in French with English subtitles because I enjoy getting the feel for the actual language spoken as opposed to a dubbed movie and I was appalled by the pathetic mistranslations from French to English. Many of the English sentences make no sense at all.It's disgraceful to release a major movie like this and not have a competent English speaker check that the English captions are correct. Was this the work of Google Translate? How much of an investment can that be compared to the overall budget for the movie?
4,Good Story,"As others have told the plot line to the movie already I won't re-tell it here. I will say that it was a wonderfully done movie - beautifully shot and executed- the characters were believable and lifelike, and the plot line was gripping. However, like many other movies, if you read the bookSarah's Key (Movie Tie-in)you might be a little disappointed- some things are inevitable skipped, shortened, and lost in translation from book to movie. However overall I enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it."
4,Nice film,There has been many films about the extermination of jews. This is a good one. It bring the story from a different angle: how does someone feel about benefitting from the misfortune of the jews that were exterminated.
4,A KEY UNLOCKS A SECRET,"In 2009, a reporter begins to research the arrest and detention of Jewish families in Paris in 1942.The reporter is stunned to learn that her husband's family apartment was the scene of an unspeakable incident, and as she digs further into the history and interviews those who have memories of that time, a disturbing secret comes to light.Kristin Scott Thomas stars as the journalist.Based on the novel of the same name, the tone and haunting devastation of the time is captured realistically through flashbacks. What does a mysterious key reveal about that fateful night? And what does the lingering guilt do to those who were left behind? An emotionally captivating film,Sarah's Keywill not be soon forgotten."
5,Read book and watched movie in 1 day~,"Loved the movie, wonderful representation of the book. Read Sarah's Key yesterday and watched it after. Always feel like book will be better than movie, but it the movie was a wonderful compliment to the book. Breaks your heart, but a part of the history of France you do not often hear about..."
3,Too Scattered,"As far as the movie's writing and directing both were well conceived but offered little new to our list of Holocaust stories other than preserve and remind us of what humans can do to each other. It seemed very ""Diary of ..."" like. Acting was superb. My main criticism is that the story seemed too scattered amongst all the parties presented and didn't spend much time on Sarah's family and most importantly on Sarah herself as she grew older. We are given little if no insight into her experiences and thoughts. She suddenly kills herself in a bizarre fashion. Sarah's story as an adult seemed too little and too disjointed.On a separate thought I was struck by the parallel between what it was like to live as a Jew in those times and what it is like to live as a Palestinian in these times. Hopefully the conservative Israeli Jewish community can see that parallel also."
2,Sarah's Key,A gripping story of how the French let down their own Jewish citizens.Movie very convoluted and confusing. The book is much better especially having to read sub titles while trying to keep up with the story line.
4,Sarah's Key is a MUST watch,"Excellent Franco-American co-production set between the beginning of WW2 and the present, as American Journalist, working on a story about the Nazzi occupation of France, discovers a connection as she inhabits an apartment in Paris which holds the ""key"" to her story. Presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, with subtitles during the French dialog scenes, this is a well directed and effectively photogaphed thrilling drama. Excellent performance by a great cast which includes Kristin Scott Thomas in the leading role, ad supporing cast includes Aidan Quinn. I recommend this film highly."
5,Heartbreakly wonderful,This movie was wonderful! I received it well before expected and was thoroughly enraptured by the story. It was everything I hoped it would be and more!
3,Interesting history,"Count me as one who was not familiar with the French complicity in this particular incident. Also a great fan of the young lady who mesmerizes the audience with her efforts to save her brother. The ending slipped into a foolish romance novel territory, but overall a good story."
3,The same old dog put through the wringer once again.,"My 13-year old son though the movie was great. I, on the other hand am less than satisfied.Being Polish, the subject of WWII and the persecution of Jews is dear to my heart, and I am a sucker for a good dramatic war story.But.I found ""Sarah's Key"" to be predictable. After the first 15 minutes I voiced my prediction about the film's ending (to my son, out-loud), and an hour-and-a-half later I was proven 90% right.I found uninspired and uninspiring similarities of this film to the 1982 ""Sophie's Choice""by Alan Pakula, or 2010 ""Joanna"" by Feliks Falk (both better movies).The acting is over-done, over the top. There are some naive and illogical scenes, over-dramatized.A good story needs to be character-driven, and this one is plot-driven, and like I already said - the plot is one that is old-and-tried, and predictable."
3,Not what I wAs expecting,"I am bit disappointed. I actually thought I had ordered the movie & not the sound track . At best, the sound tract was not what I It was I anticipated for it's musical track. Not sure I recommend."
3,Sarah's Key,I was completely taken with the book and looked forward to the movie but found if I had not read the book I would not have liked the movie. It was hard to follow.
3,INTERESTING,Overall movie was good. It has a story attached and you must stay with it. Slow but worthwhile to see the end. Acting was good.
5,Sarah's key (kindle on windows phone),"Even though this book made me cry a few times, I LOVED it! Showed up on my computer AND my Windows phone immediately after purchase!"
2,Cannot enjoy watching horror story,"I am always amazed to hear that some people like going to those horror chain-saw massacre movies, since you could probably get a cheap seat near a busy highway and end up seeing some pretty gory stuff. And it is odd to me that people want to view such realism in a story and applaud that, if it has such great acting and such realism as someone having to take a dump in the wrong place, showing you such true life. Sure, it was great drama and a story that might need to be told, but should you not tame it up a bit for the big screen and at least have a happy ending of some sort? Even Schindler's List had some hope, and not as much depressing overwhelming dread, and a good inspiring ending. I found myself wanting to get a drink and watch any comedy I could find. Sorry if I offended anyone."
3,It was ok,It was alright i expected more coupons to deal with actual sex and not some stupid things such as the *Hug you from behind* or the *Dress you from scratch* didnt like it too much.
1,DVI screw broke off in my video card,"After 2 months of normal use, the screw broke and it took a lock wrench to get out. Hopefully amazon will arrange an exchange and I hope this is the only time such a thing has happened.Again - I'm not kidding. There was no abuse or pulling of the cable. I've screwed it in and out twice to move the unit. Third time, it popped off.Monster Cable HDMI 400 DVI-2M High-Definition Video Interconnect 2 Meters"
1,market warehouse CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE IS POOR,"after ordering a nonster cable from monster wharehouse,i find out its the wrong one for my comp. i called MARKET WAREHOUSE to discuss the order,RUDE.IGNORENT...AND COMPLETE JERKS . THEY SAID IT WAS MY PROBLEM ,I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE DETAILS ONLINE DIDNT MENTION ALOT OF THINGS ,THEY SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE READ IT MORE CAREFULLY,MOST PLACES WILL AT LEAST SEND YOU A RETURN LABLE E-MAIL BUT THEY INSISTED IT WASNT THERE FAULT,DONT BUY FROM THEM UNLESS YOUR SURE AND CALL THE MAKER OF THE PRODUCT TO VERIFY ALL SPECS FOR USE. BOB IN PA. PS. SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR ELECTRONICE THAN MARKET WHAREHOUSE,BAD SERVICE AND RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT."
1,worst BRS book,very dry. hated this book. kept trying to use it but felt like i was getting nothing out of it.
2,not good,"timely service, book was not in good condition. there were a lot of wear and tear. I had to keep it because I need the content."
4,great remix cd,cd is great remixes of lots of great songs some are too short to mix with but over all a great cd would recommend.
2,An OK CD,"Some of the songs are OK , but the were others that would have been better if they were by the original singers."
1,"Good spectrum, bad construction","The light is nice, but the lamp's construction is terrible. I guess it it made to be put together very carefully and never touched or adjusted. The pole screws together in several locations and as much as we tried to tighten it, being careful to not cross-thread the fragile aluminum threads, it still looked kinked instead of straight as in the picture (the head of the light seemed too heavy for the strength of the pole). Also, after some use in adjusting the angle of the light, the head would no longer stay in place and would flop down. (The lamp didn't offer any way of tightening the head.) After two years the bolt that holds the lamp's pole to the base got stripped and it no longer stays up. To the trash it goes. Expensive for such cheap quality. Also be aware that the bulb, which I did need to replace, cost between $15 and $20 each."
3,Read the description better and look at the photos closely,Received this lamp as a requested gift. From the photograph it looks like the height of the lamp is adjustable but it is fixed. The color is much more copper than i had expected and this fixture takes a specific type of CFL bulb and the one which comes with it is very white and harsh. Aside from these few areas of improvement i'm happy with the lamp.
5,Great Scary Movie!!!,"Well done and had me like, ""Whoa!"" when everything comes together - must see! I am a huge fan of scary/horror/gory films, and this is one to see!"
3,Quite a bit better than your average low-budget horror film,"I was taken in by this little sleeper of a film. Very well acted,scary and mysterious with a ""fresh"" take on the haunted house theme.It does have inconsistencies here and there....and an over-the-topand doesn't-make-sense ending, but nevertheless, this film is worthwatching. As others have said, Netflix has it for free."
4,This was a pleasant surprise,"This movie is eerie, suspenseful and has an ending I didn't see coming.Another poster commented that ""an ending that has been done to death""...really? I don't remember any other movies with an ending quite like this one.As long as you rent this not expecting big budget special effects, if you like creepy movie you'll be satisfied."
4,Suspenseful and Creative,"I expected this movie to be slightly scary but to follow a pattern that I expected. It was well done, and surprising. Good work."
4,great suspense,"So hard to find a good scary movie without all the excess blood, gore, and torture. This had great suspensful moments, with haunted house aspects. I liked it a lot."
2,Bate and Swtich,"The trailer promised one thing and the movie delivered something else. I hate that. Story was OK, but production values needed to be a lot better as did the actiing."
3,the pact,I was a little disappointed in the direction that this movie took. I would have liked it better if they left more of the scenes up to the watchers imagination.
3,A shocking moment or two...,"This film was derived from a short that was expanded upon and was shot in just 18 days. Without spoiling it! Our heroine is aided by the supernatural to uncover a terrifying murderous family secret past. A lot of creative camera work spawn a few scary jolts from an otherwise intelligent but average script. Good casting, especially of the gratuitous creepy median. Blood and gore is kept to a minimum. The implausable ending leaves this viewer unsatisfied. Never the less this flick makes for an amusing rental, more so than some of this years big budget busts."
4,I jumped!,Good to watch late at night...send a few chills up my spine.The end had a pretty good twist as well.
5,The Pact,"This film was a great surprise. Well Done! I loved the way in which the Director used a regular house to be the ""Haunted House"". The sound track built tension perfectly and the Director had the confidence in his script to let the audience try to figure out what the ""Ghost"" was trying to warn the protagonist about!"
4,"Spooky, scary and spectacular!!!","After watching that disappointing movie ""The Tall Man"" I was desperately in need of something good to restore my faith in the current crop of horror movies. This movie delivered just that and then some! I wont spoil it (you'll have to watch it for yourself) but the ending left room for a possible sequel which I hope they make. This film was well directed and the actors did great!!!Only one thing that slightly puzzles me... defined, a ""pact"" is a formal agreement between individuals or parties. The title wasn't too good a fit for the movie as there was no agreements made between anyone in the film. I'm not complaining here just pointing it out. A good title would have been ""Below"" since a referece is made in the movie with the Ouija board scene."
3,some unknowns; good creepy stuff,"I am still not sure what happened with the guy and with the sister but all in all, this is good creepy fare and well acted by a cast that you may or may not know."
1,not very scary,"Not very scary at all,long and drawn out.Very poor ending,Glad I didnt go to the movies to watch this one.Low budget in my view.This is the most I spent to watch a movie at amazon and this is the worse.yuck! dont waste your money."
3,Surprisingly decent horror flick,"I watched this film without high expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. It had some genuinely scary moments (the kind that raise the hair on the back of your neck) but very few of the worn out cliches and tiresome jump-out-at-you gimmicks. There is an interesting plot twist that will have you thinking back over earlier scenes in the movie about what caused certain things to happen. Overall, an entertaining little horror flick with a fairly original plot."
5,Suspensful,"This flick was full of suspense. There isn't much blood and gore at all. It is a suspenseful mystery with a bit of a twist ending. Reminded me of the the movie, ""What Lies Beneath"" in that it doesn't rely on blood and gore to give you chills. I thought the acting was well done. There are a couple of plot holes, but it is way better than most horror flicks that usually have huge plot holes and it really will scare you if you like classic horror movies. I saw it in a theater, so I can't tell you anything about the quality of the DVD or Digital Download."
3,it's just OK,"This swing does what it is supposed to do. It swings. It also plays different types of music and sounds. However, it eats batteries like crazy! I do like that is has different sitting positions. Not really for a baby under 8 pounds."
4,Great message but inaccurate martial arts-wise,"My son loves this book as do I, but I would love it more if I weren't a longtime student of Sifu Ken Lo, 7th Generation Master of Wu Mei Pai and Head of the Wu Mei Kung Fu association. While everyone's version of events of Wu Mei's life will be somewhat different, there is a very real martial art called Wu Mei that descends directly from Wu Mei herself. The nun Wu Mei's movement as depicted in the story are very different from the Wu Mei I've studied for the last 15 years. I suppose that is poetic and artistic license, but it's a shame nonetheless, especially as the author interved Sifu Lo and watched his class."
4,Lovely art combined with the ideals of kinug fu,"I know little of the history of Kung Fu, but I have to say this lovely book did much for my understanding. This recites one legend of Wu Mei and her student. The history of Wu Mei's life is given before she becomes a monk. Then the story leads then to Mingyi, a young girl who wishes to keep herself from marrying a bandit. She studies with Wu Mei, hoping to learn the art of Kung Fu. The illustrations are easily the best part of this book, fresh and detailed and very Chinese. The story itself is captivating, though much of the writing seemed mediocre (yes, I get that this is a children's book). But that's really my own complaint. The best part is this book moves Kung Fu into a realm of women, and little girls have got to love that."
4,Dare to be Pleasantly Surprised,"I had started to give up on Lou Barlow. Recent Sebadoh offerings have lacked urgency and force. Sentridoh, a perfect outlet for Barlow's most intimate confessions, has no place with the now more mature and tamer Barlow. The Folk Implosion offers some great groovy numbers, but it still sounds like two young guys, though talented, just screwing around. I was ready to part with Lou as I have Westerberg and countless others. But I always hoped he would find something great once more. Enter One Part Lullaby.Sweet langorous music proves the perfect backdrop for Barlow's now broader lyrics. Most songs are as listenable as Kid Loco's sweetest grooves. And yet the signature Barlow melancholy seeps into several songs. And while his lyrics seemed pasted on several recent Sebadoh songs, they now seem utterly perfect.Bravo to the lads! JD and LB forever!One Part Lullaby"
4,groovy,The best thing to say about this very tasty album is that it's the logical follow up to the Feelies groovefest The Good Earth.
4,Continues to overwhelm me,"I bought this cd on a whim - liked the tone of the reviews, had liked Sebadoh's one popular tune from ""Harmacy"" (though not the rest of it - too rattle-y, though I didn't give it a chance). Expected a scratchy, melodic folk/blues album. Uh, no way - this is an amazingly high-techno electronic but melodic album with soaring vocal interplay. I don't like it all the way through, but the high points are my favorite music of the year: My ritual, One Part Lullabye, EZLA, and (esp) No Need To Worry. A gorgeous whoosh of electronic melody (with, indeed, folk melodic underpinnings) that I have not tired of after 2 months (at least the high points)"
2,Am i missing something?,"Am i missing something? Where are the good songs? This record was obviously recorded digitally, and it suffers from it completely. Lack of emotion here, which is surprising from Lou. I guess we all get boring in our old age."
3,nice try,"the song writing sounds rushed. the beats are chunky, but very conservative, and ... i just dont like them. i liked thier hit from the kids soundtrack with all the silver apples samples - but that was kind of crass. the serge track is really sad. is that the best they can do? im listening to basement jaxx right now. maybe folk implosion can get a remix."
1,Waste of money.,"I bought this so I could keep better track of my butter intake. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure accurately, so it doesn't fit my needs. I won't spend the money to return it and therefore add insult to injury, so it's in my 'never use, waste of money', pile."
2,It's a great idea,"This is a great idea (hence the 2 stars), however the wire broke SO easy that it was out of use in 4 attempts with the 2 wires. Just not sturdy enough for use...."
3,Could Work Better,"I have been looking for this product for months and finally found it on Amazon.com. Butter is difficult to cut, so I love the concept. However, the Buttermate would have been perfect if they would have used a small slicing blade instead of a wire, and a rather thick one at that. It cuts thicker slices well, but struggles with thin slices. This is because the wire ""pushes"" its way through the butter, so it has a hard time making a clean, thin slice. I haven't had the failure problem cited in other reviews, but I think they could have completely avoided wire failures if they would have used a thin blade. A blade would make clean, smooth cuts, no matter how thin. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product and it does what I expected, except for thin slices."
4,I love this butter dispenser...However...,"I absolutely love this butter dispenser, however after a few months, the spring in the door pops out or breaks & then its trash. Does anyone else have this problem? I hate buying them over & over just to have them break. I sure wish they would improve the mechanism."
5,Well made and simple to use.,"Not only is this is a great time saving device, it also prevents butter sticks from getting all crusty and dried out. It is well made with quality materials, and has a an easy to use measuring system and cutting mechanism. This is a great item and would be a value at twice the price."
1,Not so practical,"This is a gimicky item and not even worthy of being sold at a dollar store, bought the corn butterer one also and feel like a mark, boy I sure got took. Sure it's only 10 bucks but I could have a ceasar or a couple beer for that and just sliced the butter with a knife."
1,Broke the First Week,The wire broke and the plastic opener fell off before making it through one cube of butter. This is a worthless piece of junk.
5,ButterConfidante,"Like most people, I confront near insurmountable challenges trying to keep my butter tidy. All I've gotten are hollow promises from products avowing their ability to keep my butter neat; yet no matter what activity involving butter, and no matter what butter tidier I'm using, invariably an indecorous sum of Beurre d'Echire will get on the fluted pilaster (with quills filling the fluting), despite being with my butter some 40 feet away and in another room. I ruined an oval Svres china plaque with Isigny-Ste-Mere, which confounds me considering how I was at least 56 feet away at the time. The devastation caused me to prostrate myself for days beneath my Dorokhsh antique rug assuaging my despair with Ravel's Pavane for a Deceased Infanta, and eating lavender seeds.The ButterMate has given me new confidence, and butter is no longer the scourge of my upholstered furniture, et al."
3,"Great for portion control, but...","I love this gadget, it helps with portion control. You can slice the thinnest sliver of butter, unfortunately the wire that does the slicing breaks easily. I went through the one it came with as well as the backup in less than a month. Much as I love it, I will not be ordering any more.That is the reason for 3 stars. If the wire could be made more durable, it would easily be 5 stars!!!"
4,handy but a bit fragile,"This is a really handy way to store butter and use when cooking. I don't even care much about the measurement markings, just the convenience of slicing off chunks of butter with one hand and not having to grab (or dirty) a utensil.But, it's not all that sturdy. If I break another one I'll be torn whether I should buy yet another. Have to be a bit careful with it, and maybe avoid slicing really hard butter. I'd happily pay more for a really well made version of this."
3,"very handy, very fragile.","We love the way this dispenser works. We have purchased several over the years. Our only complaint is that this gizmo, as nice as it is to use, breaks very quickly, causing us to either replace it or work without it. I would be willing to pay a bit more to get a more durable product."
3,Would be nice if it didn't break so easily,"Just a month and the wire broke. The slider tab was a little sticky which didn't slide as easy as it should have. It was pretty nice when it worked but the plastic broke where it holds the wire so now its just another piece of plastic from China for the landfill ""ugh"". It may last longer if you let the butter soften a little but if you let the butter get too soft then put it back in the fridge the butter sticks and it won't slide out easily. Not a big deal but several times I had to take a knife to lift the butter loose. It may be a little too fragile for every day use. I really liked the product I just wish it was made a little more sturdier. If it would have lasted longer I would have given it 4 or 5 stars."
2,Loved it but breaks easily,I had a similar butter cutter before this one. I loved it but after about five years it broke. This one was plastic except the wire and spring. After about a year the plastic hinge broke. I loved being able to easily measure and cut my butter but I won't be buying another plastic cutter.
5,One kitchen item I can't do without,"I had one of these for years and when it got broken I missed it so much. I was very happy to find that the product was still availabe so I bought two. I was going to keep the second one as a back up. Then I started thinking about the fact that the first one had lasted at least 10 years before it accidently got broken by a guest who didn't know how to use it. So I gave the second one to my son. I am happy to note that the quality is the same as my original one so I plan to get at least 10 years from this one too. I use it when measuring for recipes, for buttering toast with thin slices, etc. It is very sturdy and very handy. I keep mine in the fridge, loaded and ready to go."
2,The gospel when it first hit press; outdated now,"This was the first book I owned on the subject and could not believe the amount of training that the authors recommended one need do to finishi a triathlon. Given that the book is a bit old, I believe that these recommendations are a sign of those times. Nowadays, people know that one can do very well at the sport of triathlon on significantly less training, and I point the interested reader in the direction of books such as ""Time-saving ..."" and Sleamaker's ""SERIOUS Training..."". These books are equally scientific, but do not put as much emphasis on having to cover so many miles, but rather inform you on how to spend whatever time you actually have to train.I would not recommend this book to a newcomer, nor to a seasoned triathlete anymore, but a few years ago I might have..."
2,Too technical for beginners,"I am a previous distance runner (high school and college) who also enjoys mountain biking and recreational swimming. I have never competed in a triathalon before. For a beginner, this book focused too much on the technical aspects of training for professional triathletes.Much of the book focused on complex training cycles and tracking methods. I had hoped to see recommended programs for beginners, such as base level resistance training to increase muscle tone and endurance, and base level cardiovascular workouts, followed by guidance for moving to the next level.I also would have liked a listing of organizations in my area that organize triathalons.For the most part, this book assumes the reader is already familiar with triathalons and training. I would recommend beginners look elsewhere."
4,Great for beginners,"This is a good book for everyone thinking about triathlons. It offers good advice on choosing equipment, techniques and training programs.Instead of relying on distance, its programs focus on time and percentage. Since biking encompasses usually 50% of the race, training should focus 50% on biking (unless you're very weak in one of the other legs).It offers sample worksheets to set up your own program, based on the type of triathlon-sprint to Ironman."
4,Lot's of information!!,"I found this book extremely helpful for a single sport athlete looking to make the transition to triathalons. Lot's of good info. However, I found the training programs hard to follow and left me looking for more complete training books."
2,"Doesn't fit, either end","This is a badly needed item if you want to run 5"" ducting to you 4"" ported machines. I cannot get 5"" tubing (sold by Grizzly) to fit over (or in) the 5"" end, and the 4"" end will not fit (too small) over any the 4"" ports that I have on 5 different machines. I'll be returning the item.Ells"
5,Great Purchase,"My son and I loved this on Netflix and were so disappointed when they took it off. What a great surprise to find that Amazon offered the series at a low price, with a significant number of episodes. When my son opened the package on Christmas, I knew it was a win!!!"
4,naruto,"the naruto series is a very middle of the line story of a boy wanting to gain respect and feel needed, the kids & I enjoyed the series very much."
3,Gift for my son,I bought this dvd collection as a gift for my son. I had heard of Naruto but wasn't sure of what it was. Naruto reminded me of those old Chinese films from the 70s and 80s. It bored the heck out of me but made my son very happy.
5,Great half of the season,"This was a good part of the Naruto series, many awesome events happen and in the next box set begins the final and probably best arc in the original Naruto series. I bought this at a very good price to complete my entire collection, this set had a lot of episodes too which was great."
3,"Naruto Uncut Box Set: Season Two, Vol.1","Worth the money, action packed non stop, excellent dvd quality, no problems.Please note when buying it says in Japanese only but you do have the option to have voice in Japanese or ENGLISH."
2,"It's not the Season, its the disc. (READ)","So I put the fist disc in my computer and first of all it had two ads at the beginning that you can't fast forward. Second, there is like this green glitchy box in the bottom left corner. It might only be disc one but not sure. About to check disc 2. It may be my DVD drive. xP Nope, the first disc is terrible. So make sure you check all of the discs, don't relax cuz the packaging looks okay."
4,The adventure continues,"In this set, the adventure continues by finishing up the invasion of the leaf. Episodes 79-80(The best 2 episodes in this set) Five episodes introducing sasukes brother Itachi. Episodes 81-85. Also, Naruto goes on a journy with Jiraya, training, and also looking for one of the legendary sanin to be the 5th hokage. Episodes 86-96. Then some sluggish filler. Episodes 97-106.(However 101 is a VERY entertaining filler) As you can see, this set has a wide variety. Also, a necessary addition to your naruto collection if you want the whole series on dvd. A lot of content for cheap. My only problem with this is the cheap packaging that falls apart. Also the lack of special features. However it is uncut, and the episodes are great. Awesome purchase."
3,Pleasant Fun,"Basically, this is 28 minutes of cat close-ups as they lounge, walk around, and play with fishing-rod toys and feathers. There's no sound other than bits of (largely instrumental) traditional children's songs and some classical music. Right in the middle, there are scenes with a cougar and a couple of bobcats for variety. Then, it's back to the cats. Overall it's quite pleasant though not compelling. This will appeal to very young cat-lovers, as well as cats themselves. My own cats found it fascinating."
1,Packaging Issue,"The product is okay but, I received 2 damaged lanterns with my initial order of 5. The glass was broken in several places on both. I reordered replacements multiples times and each one came damaged. I finally gave up and switched to a different lantern in the same product line."
3,Kentucky Musicians Branch Out,"Listening to the Headhunters is like taking a road trip through the American south in a beat down dual-purpose farm truck. ""Soul"" is a stop in a different city with each track, experiencing the different cultural and musical perspectives each with a unique local slant. Around in one incarnation or another since 1968, the Grammy-winning headhunters have put together an album consisting of soulful southern vocals, a forcefully funky rhythm section and a Hammond B-3 that accompanies tunes like ""Last Night I Met Carl Perkins"" and ""I Still Wanna be Your Man."" Impressively structured, the bass track is layered perfectly underneath a fusion of raw twang and smooth slide blues.The Headhunters deliver a fusion of southern-influenced Country & Rock N' Roll, livening things up with different approaches to each individual track."
3,"Not the ""real"" Zac Brown.","This is another artist. This one is from Oklahoma, and records in Los Angeles. For more info, look up Zac Brown at CDBaby.com I thought there was a law about performers not using the same name!"
5,Excellent,This is a great CD for Dokken fans. They sound great and you get to hear all of the golden oldies from back in the day. It was a very pleasant surprise.
5,Great pattern plus all of it is dishwasher & microwave safe,"Practical for everyday use and fancy enough for more formal meals. Back in 2001 when I bought these on amazon, they had the best prices anywhere for the various Mikasa bits and pieces. Good stuff!"
2,Short lived,"I have had this coffee/espresso maker since June 2007. I thought it was working well but apparently missed the fact that it has been leaking for some time and damaging my countertop. Today, the red light indicator for drip coffee began blinking, so I followed the instructions and cleaned exactly as it said. Well, the light is still on. Given that and the leaking issues, I'm very disappointed with the product. It's definitely not a cheap machine, it was well cared for and used lightly (coffee 3-4x/week, espresso 2-3x/week. This thing should have performed much better than this."
5,Merry Christmas,I can't give a review of this product as it was purchased for a Christmas gift. All I can say is I'm very satisfied with all my purchases from Amazon.com. The prices are great and I received my orders very quickly. I give Amazon 5 stars.
1,buttons get Steamed,"Over time steam will ruin this machine.. As above reviews wrote, my machine stopped working after about 8 months.This is a terrible engineering design. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,"Great Coffee, poor manufacturing","Coffee tastes great, however the machine did start leaking. Water was all over my counter and floor as well. You would think that the manufacturer would address this. Think that there is a possible safety hazard. Water leaking, coffee maker plugged in electricity... dont know."
4,Expresso Every Day,"My Mom had one and my husband wanted his own, liked it so much we bought one for our son. It works great, we have latte's every day... and my husband loves waking up to the smell of made coffee, better then an alarm clock... It doesn't come with a frothing cup so make sure you get that seperate."
1,leaky and lame,"I got this model for our home and have had nothing but trouble ever since! Let's just say this: when I purchased this coffee maker/espresso maker, I didn't expect to fight my way through the immense and continuous LAKE that formed underneath the machine every time I made a pot of brew! I happen to be one of those people that finds waking up and getting possibly electrocuted before breakfast just a bit too much for my liking, thank you very much! The leak lake stops here."
3,Coffee,After returning the item twice (2) because of problems with the unit not brewing at all and the clock not work we received a replacement. The replacement works great.
1,piece of junk... used once and went busted,"got it by exchanging my airline mileages.used once for dripped coffee, worked well, however a week later when i try it again it simply doesn't work - press the button to make drip coffee but water won't boil.after seeing the reviews here, i guess it is not a surprise... shouldn't there be a recall / refund for this piece of junk? or a class action?"
1,Not worth the money,"Coffee maker stopped working after less than a year. Heating component failed. I was informed this was a regular problem with this model. If you don't have the originally receipt, one year warranty won't cover repairs, which would've been $50."
1,Worst purchase ever made,"I've had this machine for about 18 months. After about 6 months of use, the coffee side started leaking until now it does not work any more. I contacted DeLonghi and all they had to say was to take it to a service center, which by the way are few and far apart. My previous coffee/espresso machine was a Krups and it lasted for 10 years. I will never buy DeLonghi products again and certainly do not recommend this product. Mine will go into the trash and we'll replace it with another brand."
1,Cheaply made,"The machine stopped working completley after 2 months and light usage. Bad electronics, poor quality checking, who knows....but you will want to avoid it."
1,COFFEE MAKER LEAKS,"I purchased this February of 2008, after 1 month it started leaking, I thought it was condensation, my counter top and floor in that area are ruined. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I'm disappointed because it makes really good coffee and cappuccino. Waste of money."
1,Horrible product and service,We purchased this direct from Delonghi. It broke within 2 months. For warranty service we had to send it at our expense to a service center. They've had it for 3 weeks and haven't even looked at it. The rep was rude and told us they may not get to it for 5 weeks. That's before they even look at it!!! Delonghi customer service basically told us TFB. Some friends of ours bought a Delonghi coffee maker and it failed within only a few months too. Avoid this coffee maker.
1,Stopped working after 2 months.,I loved this machine until it stopped working at 2 months with no warning. The expresso portion worked will except for the difficulty of fitting the frothing cup under the steamer. The coffe portion stopped functioning 2 months after purchase.
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!!,"Things were just great until the machine started leaking all over. It's not an inexpensive machine, but the removable water tank is cheap trash. We didn't immediately notice the leaking onto the counter from the bottom of the machine, now the countertop has a bulge from being wet for so long and the leak is only getting worse. The customer service offered no help. They refered us to a website that didn't even offer the replacement tank. Look elsewhere for a machine like this, this brand is trash."
5,Works so far,I like the way you fill this less spills and water mess. So far the coffee has been good and the machine is easy to clean.
1,disappointed,"Very disappointed waited it seemed like forever i have had a DeLonghi before and was anticipating its arrival. It did not work I followed the instructions to the letter and could not get the damn thing working. I was extremly upset, I went to great lengths to get this model!!!!!!I have been given a refund and now I dont know what brand to get"
1,another leaky unit,"Seems almost pointless to restate what everyone has said, but figured it was worth adding to the case file. Our unit also 1) leaks a huge puddle every time, 2)doesn't brew through the center of the grounds, 3) occasionally makes a very weak pot.It seems like we've had better luck than some others since it took a couple of years of daily use to develop these problems. I might even give it 2-3 stars as a result. But since all of these reviews clearly show that it's a known problem, it pisses me off and I give it one star.Anyone have a good recommendation for a coffee maker?!?!? We've had many bad ones over the years and no very good ones."
2,Potentially great product - POOR Company,"I love the part of the product that works. We just want foam with our coffee and it works great for that.Mechanically it has issues. It leaks on the bottom, not terribly but enough to ask WHY would you not correct this.Customer support = WORST EVER SEENHere's the company's scam. the small plastic latch that holds the coffee maker in place broke, instead of just sending you the part under warranty, they require you send the ENTIRE UNIT on YOUR DIME. They know you probably won't do this and therefore save themselves a lot of money. Shameful.I used a hardware store brass hook and drilled a small hole on the top of the unit and positioned it so it would hold, it lasted to this day where their plastic part broke after a few months use."
1,Delonghi Coffee Maker BCO-120T,"This is my second Bco-120t machine already. It is the worst coffee machine I had. I recieved this machine as a gift last year. The first one didn't work at all. I exchanged to the second one, we use it for about 9 months. It started leaking water from the bottom and stopped working again. The customer service people is helpless, they don't understand the machine is not working. Just keep telling you run the descaling, please do not ever buy this brand again. We had a dehumidifier bought couple years ago, it caught fire on the outlet. I don't think they are good brand, cheap product."
1,So many problems,"I've owned 3 of these over as many years. We stuck with the model thinking maybe we just got a bad unit, and we had also invested in 3 extra carafes. After the SOB shocked me today I threw it in the trash.So many problems with this unit. Just one of many is it loses the clock settings if unplugged or the power goes out, meaning you have to set it up again every time.Given such a basic design flaw you can imagine the other issues.Steer clear of this one. We are going to buy a different brand and suck up the cost of getting some extra carafes.FYI a replacement carafe for this thing is $40"
1,Leaks and customer service,"Received this as a Christmas gift but didn't use it until this summer. After a few uses, it started leaking from the bottom. We contacted DeLonghi and left a message. We are sending it in at our expense to have it repaired and they pay to ship it back to us. We don't think their customer service is worthless like some reviewers have expressed. DeLonghi must be aware of this problem. We did not register the product for the warranty but they allowed us to send it for repair without the warranty. We hope the problem will be fixed. We will edit our review once we get the product back. I don't think I would recommend this product because of the leaking problem that so many people have had.We would not have bought it had we read the reviews on Amazon. Whether we buy from Amazon or not, we do trust the reviews."
1,Great if you want to wash your counters and floor!,Don't bother! This worked great for the first two months then the coffee side stopped working completely. The espresso side stil works but it leaks so much dang water that I literally can mop my floor with the amount of water that ends up all over the place. After all the crappy reviews I am sure no one is dumb enough to buy this peice of crap!
1,Poor quality,"I got this coffee, espresso, cappuccino maker for Christmas this year and so far it does what it's supposed to. I did run it a few times with the regular coffee side and the espresso side including the steamer with water before using coffee as the instructions say to. I haven't had any problems. The one difference between this and a very expensive version would be the plastic accessories vs. heavy duty metal. Still it makes good coffee and I like that you don't have to buy filters for it and the auto time set, so it brews while I'm getting ready in the am. The price seems reasonable for a coffee maker and I think I would have bought it had it not been bought for me.Update:The coffee maker broke after 1 day of use. I would not recommend purchasing this model due to the poor construction. The one cup of coffee I was able to drink did taste good. As always, your mileage may vary."
1,Good to read other reviews,"Was getting ready to purchase and read the reviews, wise thing to do. Looks like any one who bought this complained. Thanks for the negative reviews saved me a hassle."
1,More time in the shop than on my counter,The display died on the 5th day and it took 3 weeks to get it back from the shop. 3 weeks later the espresso steamer died. 5 weeks to get it back from the shop. 2 days later the red plastic steam director part broke. I held it in by hand for about two weeks and then the brewer part stopped working. It has been at the shop for more than 2 weeks now. Absolute rubbish. DONT BUY a DeLonghi!
1,DO NOT BUY,"I received this machine as a christmas gift, I like having the option to make expresso/cappacino but it just didn't work well from the start. It leaked water from the bottom and now it has just stopped working. This is my second Delonghi that stopped working after about 8 months of ownership."
1,not worth the money,I purchased this item April 27th - the espresso portion never worked right - the temperature of the espresso was lukewarm at best. The coffee maker worked fine until about a week ago. Now the coffee maker has stopped working completely after less than 90 days!
5,True COFFEE lover,"I received this coffee machine as a gift after moving cross country. I drink espresso/cappucino daily and drip coffee only occasionally, and I really loved my friend's Caffe Nabucco machine of the same brand. I love this gift. It is a coffee center, giving me several options for my own coffee needs (I like my coffee better than all those other coffee shops.) The frother is a nice addition, although it isn't practical if you are in a rush - it needs immediate cleaning. The drip side - and the programmable timer - is an improvement over the previous model and really handy. I use it daily and have not had one problem in three months with any part of the machine."
1,Garbage,"I purchased this 3 months ago, this never really makes a hot cup of coffee, the espresso portion sort of works but is a difficult to use and it is difficult to get your cup under the steamer. Also the espresso maker is not as hot as it should be. The removable water tank leaks and you will find a puddle under the unit. I dropped the plastic water tank from about 2 feet off the ground and it cracked, making it useless, I was suprised how soft plastic could break so easily, and as of yet I am unable to find a replacement, and Delonghi wont respond to my emails. this unit is cheaply made, and not worth the 100 bucks I spent on itlook elsewhere for a better combination machine"
2,Replacing this thing after 9 months,"I got this coffee maker in late 2007. It's beautiful from the outside and a number of reviews of similar DeLonghi machines got my hopes up.I had serious problems with the espresso machine. First, it was almost impossible to get the espresso filter cup (where the grinds go) to attach securely to the unit. This resulted in grinds and water all over my counter top. I had to push so hard to latch it that I thought I was going to break the handle off.The steamer was difficult to use and I ended up burning my hand. I never tried using the espresso portion again.For the first 6 months or so, the coffee maker worked pretty well. About 2 months ago, I noticed grinds were spilling into the coffee pot when the coffee was brewing and the water reservoir started leaking. I have probably half a cup of water on my counter from the coffee maker every day.It's frustrating that my old $10 Mr.Coffee was more reliable than this thing."
1,Do Not Buy This Machine,"I was given this as a gift and sadly had to look the gift-horse in the mouth. My boyfriend returned it and got his money back.This is a sub-par product that is poorly manufactured and almost 100% plastic.The coffee maker did not even work, it did nothing when we tried to make a pot of coffee, and the espresso it created was simply ""strong coffee"".I have been a barista and am knowledgeable about how to make a proper espresso. This machine is not capable of that.Use your money towards a better product - research a good pump driven machine.Or simply purchase the $40 Mr. Coffee - tho its not the quite the same, it will produce something closer to espresso than this machine ever could."
1,BROKE DOWN THE SECOND USAGE,"It wasn't a pleasant experience. We ordered this product and used according to the manufacturer's manual. The drip coffee machine portion of this combination machine broke down the second week of usage, which we probably used only 5 times less. We asked for a replacement, however the drip coffee machine again broke down but this time was only the second time of usage! We only use distilled water for brewing our coffee so it shouldn't be due to minerals within water source. The drip coffee simply just doesn't drip. I don't know if it is just our luck, but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND purchasing this model."
3,I'm taking a big chance on this one,"I just bought this knowing what I was in for based on all the reviews. I had another DeLonghi coffee maker for 6 years and never had a problem.I did notice the tank would not seat all the way when it was empty. Every time I pushed it down, it would rise back up. This may cause the tank to leak over time into the main compartment as the seal wears. The friction from the seal is not strong enough to overcome the spring of the plunger at the bottom of the removable tank (unlike my earlier model). I do not think this is the cause of all the leaks as I could not find any holes in the main compartment that holds the removable tank. I did not pour water into the compartment to find out either. I removed the spring (simple process) to keep the tank seated, but this makes the tank useless if pulled out to fill, as it will not hold water on its own.I wonder how long this new one will last? I'll change my rating as time goes."
2,Great...when it worked,"Like so many others, our DeLonghi worked great for about 8 months after purchasing. The coffee was so good! I love the flavour system to choose brew strength and I loved the removable water basket-made it so easy. However, after 8 months, it started leaking water all over the counter. The frother is also at a weird angle, so you have to lift the machine up to fit your milk froth pitcher underneath it. We have not tried contacting DeLonghi, and will be purchasing something else."
1,Poor quality product. Even worse customer service.,"I received this as a Christmas gift (so no receipt)and the plastic shaft attached to the selector knob broke soon after. I agreed to pay for a new knob and shaft after a frustrating conversation about the part with customer disservice. He acknowledged the parts I needed and billed me for parts and shipping. As you might expect, I got the knob but not the shaft (come to think of it, I did get ""the shaft""). I sent customer disservice pictures of what I need and received a surprising reply (sense my sarcasm?)The shaft was considered an internal part and they would not replace it. Of course,I was welcome to ship the entire unit to a repair facility (at my expense) to have this little plastic shaft attached to the knob. Fortunately, before I could do this, the espresso side of the unit failed, so I plan on recycling the whole piece of junk. DeLonghi? Never again."
1,Leaks! Do not buy!,"I've only had this coffee pot for 6 months and it's completely ruined my counters. The coffee pot mysteriously leaks and you don't notice it because it's contained under the unit.I called DeLonghi customer service, since I've only had it 6 months, but they want me to ship it back to them, at my cost. It's UNDER warranty. It's sad because I really like this coffee pot, but the cost of the unit isn't going to cover the cost of replacing my counter tops.Don't waste your money. Want to see how widespread the problem is? Try googling ""My Delonghi coffee pot leaks."" There are hundreds of reviews which say the same thing."
1,I wish we can put negative review,Got this as a qift for our wedding use a couple of time and water started coming out warm and eventually stopped.I contacted Delonghi (Very Rude Rep) and after arguing with them for an hour they said the would repair it. I took it in and had it repaired. After we recieved the unit back it would a couple of times and stopped again. I would recommend people to save there money and DO NOT BUY this product.
1,This coffee maker is crap,"I purchased this coffee maker during the holidays and it has quit working within the first month of use. My mistake in tossing the box during the after christmas clean up now i am stuck with it. I should have taken the previous reviews serious, my big mistake. I will never never buy a product from this company again. Please everyone do not buy this it is very cheaply made."
1,This thing SUCKS,"This things leaks like a sieve!!The service center quoted 75$ + parts which is the same cost as jsut buying a new one...I'm attempting to tear it apart now to replace the silicon hoses that I suspect are leaking, however it is apparently held together with invisible injection molded connections as per China manufacturing standard.DO NOT BY THIS OR ANY DELONGHI PRODUCT!!"
1,Not a good coffee maker,"My husband got me this combination coffee maker for Christmas. I really liked it at first, but now only 8 months later, it suddenly quit working. I love coffee makers and have had many different styles, so I know how to use them. I only use cold water, I make sure I keep it clean, and I descale it at regular intervals. However, after 8 months, it seems the pump on the drip side of this one went bad, no water will cycle from the reservoir. I have never had a coffee maker die on me before and so it really surprised me that this one did so quickly! I will never own a delonghi again! I have been trying to contact their customer service, but I end up waiting on the line for an hour and then leaving a message, horrible service!"
2,POOR USE OF MONEY,"I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE UNFAVORABLE REVIEWS ON THIS ITEM BUT DID NOT AND HAD TO EVENTUALLY RETURN IT. INITIALLY THE COFFEE POT WORKED FINE BUT THE ESPRESSO WAND WOULD NOT FROTH MILK. AMAZON RETURNED IT AND SENT ME ANOTHER ONE. THE SECOND ONE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES...THE COFFEE POT WORKED FINE BUT THE ESPRESSO MAKER HAD ISSUES. THIS TIME, THE FROTHING WAND WORKED FINE BUT THE ESPRESSO WOULD NOT BREW...THE GROUNDS WOULD NOT EVEN GET WET!! THIS ISSUES, ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT EVERY MORNING I FOUND WATER ON MY COUNTERTOP, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO LIQUID IN THE POT WHATSOVER, THE NIGHT BEFORE. I WAS VERY DISMAYED TO FIND OUT THAT THE CLOSEST PLACE TO TAKE IT TO BE FIXED BY DELONGHI WAS 8 HRS FROM MY HOME AND THEY WOULD NOT EVEN PAY FOR SHIPPING!! THANKS TO AMAZON WHO ALLOWED ME TO RETURN IT, EVEN THOUGH THE 1-YR WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED 30 DAYS PREVIOUS AND EVEN PAYED FOR SHIPPING! I WILL STICK TO MY FRENCH PRESS FROM NOW ON."
1,Leaks and the espresso has stopped working,"I loved this machine for the first 6 months, but the coffee maker started to leak over the counter and the espresso/steam stopped working completely. Very disappointing!"
3,Okay until it leaks!,"My husband purchased this as a Christmas gift about 4 years ago. Worked o.k. until it began leaking water from the machine. Can't find the leak at this point, just have to mop up the water puddle every morning after brewing. The espresso maker works good enough, but takes quite a bit of time to make. Overall, for the price, was fine until the leak. Will be purchasing a new coffee maker soon, but not another combo unit."
1,DO NOT BUY,Stopped working after 2 months. Then I contacted their customer service and they do not pay for shipping to the repair center. Worst thing I ever bought.
1,Don't buy this product,"We received this coffee maker as a wedding gift and after a week the coffee machine function stopped working. We sent it back (at our expense), they fixed it within 2 weeks and sent it back. Now it works fine but like other reviewers state it leaks, also I have to add more water then coffee I want (I fill to 6 cups instead of 4 cups) because of leaking and steam, making it more unpredictable and I often get a weaker or stronger coffee than I prefer. Also, you have to be careful the water tank in the back is firmly and tightly secured and the top shut precisely or it won't work at all. I've bought $10.00 coffee makers that lasted years with no problems, don't waste your money."
1,Stay away from this item,"Paid a lot of money, in comparison to other pots, but I wanted an espresso and coffee with seperate switches. Got this model for a Christmas present and it's already in the junk after @ 4 1/2 months of use. Espresso turns on - but the coffee side won't. I contacted the company and their advice is to ship it across the state (at my cost) there was no reference that they would pay to have it fixed but ""they will pay to ship it back."" Which means what? I got rid of a coffee/espresso machine that was working to what I thought was an upgrade. It does look nice and did make great coffe when it was working but now I'm out a combination and using an old coffee pot. I don;t think this company realizes that standing behind a product should mean it's well made in the first place. I learned my lesson. I will NEVER buy and product from this company ever again. Save the time and your money. This company is horrible to deal with and their product very inferior."
1,Stopped working....,It died just like everybody else says it did. Mine went dead just after the end of the warranty. Luckily it was a gift and I didn't pay for it!!
1,Garbage,"Do not every buy this coffee machine, nothing but problems, leaking water, expresso machine stopped working, repairs did not fix the problem, on and on."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS--Stopped working after 4 Months,"I bought this in November 2010. Now it is March of 2011. I loved the cappuccino maker. Drank cappuccinos every day. Really loved it. Should have known it would not last. It stopped working today. Just like that--stopped working. The coffee side gave problem right when we purchased it. But I did not care about the coffee. I bought it for the cappuccinos. I cleaned it routinely, descaled it and everything.After half hour on the phone, they told me another company's name and address to ship to them. I have to ship it at my own cost! It will take 3 weeks to fix. Don't know if it is worth repairing.Will not buy DeLongi products again!I read the reviews right after I purchased the item on Amazon. Lots of bad reviews. Should have returned it immediately."
1,Garbage,"NO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE! It leaked from Day 1. If we use it, we have to put the coffeemaker in the sink as water drips from the bottom. It did this from Day 1. A cursory search on the 'net shows that many, many others have this same issue. DeLonghi has been highly unresponsive. I promised that I will write a bad review everywhere until they admit that there is a serious design flaw. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!"
3,Apricot is a great flavor in tea...,"This could be stronger on the Apricot(who put the APE in Apricot?) - perhaps some bits of dried fruit in it - the way they do with their marvellous peach and ginger tea. I love Harney & Sons Tea. So far, the absolute best flavor is Passion Fruit (very flavorful). The Black Current is also really nice - as is the tasty Ginger Peach. Their tea is general is of higher quality."
5,Meaningful lylics and smooth singing...,"Here's a collection of some very original songs with meaningful lyrics, heartfelt singing and some good solid background music. It's enjoyable music to listen to. I'm sure that NOAh will value these words as he journeys through life, and the world really is a better place because of Dr. Demuth's many musical contributions"
2,Exhaust filter needs constant replacement,"...at great expense!!! And you can't just not replace it because the machine won't run if it's not replaced after, appromimately, every five bags. When it runs, it runs great (even though it is not great on bare floors, as it doesn't have the option to disengage the beater bar. The biggest problem is, it's very fussy as to when it will and will not run. It seems to be very temperamental immediately following a bag change."
2,Expensive and poor performance,"I had great expectations for this vacuum before I began using it. It is well made and has a solid feel, but for $700 you would expect this. The problem is it has poor suction and consequently does not pick very well. And this already paltry suction degrades quickly as the bag fills. I have relegated this Sebo to the closet and have replaced it with a far superior Dyson which costs far less and has much greater vacuuming power.pros:1. solid and well made2. clever automatic head height3. excellent bag systemcons:1. poor suction2. prone to tip over when using the wand3. when using wand the head brush keeps spinning, so the vacuum tends to run away along the floor.4. performance degrades quickly as bag fills5. bags and filters are hard to find and are expensive"
5,Let your brain merge.......... with GOD!,"Not quite, but it gets you there. This is by far, hands down, Isis's most devestating album to be heard by your eardrums. The vocals are very low so chances are(like me), I have yet to know all the lyrics to this CD. I know they are on the internet but I wanna wait awhile. Some say buy their new albums and work back but I did exactly the opposite. If your looking for a good ISIS album to start off with, definently this one."
1,Celestial has not arrived by this date,"Can't rate the product yet since it has not arrived. I have high hopes though! Still waiting!Best regards,Torsten Bergenheim"
3,Incredible live - decent album,"I saw Isis open up for the Melvins and put on an INCREDIBLE live performance. I give it '3 stars' because while I was hoping for this album to capture something similar to the experience of seeing them live, the overall production is a little too muddy and fails to convey the multiple-guitar onslaught that is their stage show. Nevertheless, if you can afford it, buy this album if only to support this band -- they deserve it. AND GO SEE THEM LIVE. Speaking of Godflesh [see previous review], they also recorded an EP simultaneously with this album which features a remix of 'Celestial' by none other than Justin Broaderick."
2,suks,"man alive!, just to let anyone considering this know -this album is boring as hell. i'm sorry i bought one."
3,hard to install,"1st. the driver side bar was scratched. All of the half inch lock washers were missing. The bolt plates that were to slide in a hole in the frame wouldn't fit in, They had to be shortened and the bolts ground down. The pictures were good but it was up to me to decide which bar went where. Also if you install by yourself you will need a floor jack. They do look good and make it easier to get in the truck."
3,"Bought these after reading the one review, and have to say he was exactly right.","The previous review was pretty informative. You do need to grind down a couple bolts, which don't fit correctly inside of the frame. Also it is slightly difficult to determine which step goes on which side. After I set one up I realized it was supposed to go the other way, and switched it. Other than that they are cheap and work well. The rear bracket is a little weird, so you need to look closely at the picture. They aren't the best looking or quality steps, but they are definitely better than nothing.Update- I have had them for about 3 months now, and they have already started to rust. I don't recommend these"
2,A nice surprise,The song lyrics are delightful and the arrangements will surprise you. This heartfelt collection of original tunes will grow on you.
1,No service,"Monitor finally died after 11 months and nobody at Kogi ever answers their customer service, tech support or main telephone numbers. Warranty? Doesn't exist. I'm heading to the Better Business Bureau.Update: Finally got through to them. Sent the monitor back, took 3 weeks to repair and received it back.... still not working."
1,False advertising,"I purchased two Kogi L9CH Flat-Panel 19"" LCD monitors because the advertising on the Kogi website said that they were available with an optional DVI port.I ordered the optional DVI port and after receiving my monitors found they did not contain that port. Upon calling Kogi they informed me that DVI ports were not available on that monitor. After pointing out to them that their web site indicated they were, I was told they would be happy to ship me 1000 monitors with said port since they would have to be manufactured. I could not buy just two.Seems to me to be a little less than honest advertising."
5,Super!!,"Just got mine, no dead pixel as others reported. very bright and crapy.It holds super performance:price ratio.Super!"
4,Not the best but still good,"I bought this cd since I l-o-v-e-d Punk Goes 80's. While there are some good songs on here (Bye,Bye,Bye ; The Way You Love Me; I Want It That Way), there are some that are just plain laughable. For example, the cover of ...Baby One More Time is just.. horrendous. And, Student Rick's Heaven Is A Place On Earth is just funny (the lead singer cannot hit those high notes). Also, the cover of I'm Like A Bird is... confusing. The lead singer sounds kinda like a girl. By NO means are ANY of the bands on this cd ""punk"". Seriously. Rufio is screamo/emo and so is the Starting Line, and both of those are the closest things to punk on the cd.It's still a great cd, though. It's just not as fantasmically awesome as Punk Goes 80's. (Get that instead!!! =))"
3,goofy fun party CD,"who would have thought? some of the songs on this CD are a complete turn-around from the original pop songs and are great on their own (""Get This Party Started"" and ""Send Me An Angel"") while some are so close to the original it's unappealing (""I Want It That Way"" and ""Bye Bye Bye""). there are couple songs that just don't gain anything by being covered and slow the album down. this is still the perfect party CD: everyone will know the song and be laughing at the remakes. i'm glad everyone involved with the making of this CD can laugh at themselves and have fun."
4,Fantastic,I really loved this Cd. It is worth getting just to hear some awesome versions of pop songs. I grew up on alot of these songs but have recently gotten into punk and so I thought it was awesome!! I think my favorite is the cover Baby One More Time.
2,punk goes pop?,"there isnt a single punk band on this its basicaly pop goes older pop, but oh well, ignorance is bliss."
5,takes you back,this cd is great i love. it takes you back to the 80's any punk pop fan should own this cd.
1,punk already went pop..thanks to this trash,"This is just another attempt for christian bands to cash in on whatever minimal message and knowledge of punk they have into making a cheesy throw away compilation. First off punk is supposed to be chaotic , rebellious , defiant , and downright sick at times.First as other people have called these bands the ""new age"" of punk...the new age is exactly what destroyed punk. This isn't punk..this is cheesy disturbing pop for kids who never understood punk in the first place. Maybe this comp could have been worth something if the music was fast and hard and sarcastic , nope the music was pretty much exactly the same as the originals ....."
1,Punk goes to pop? Just the name is stupid.,"This cd was terrible and just plain stupid. If I had an option to use 0 stars I would have use that. The sad thing is, I actually liked these artists and to see them sell out like this is horrible! Punk goes to pop? Just the name tells you it's stupid. I took a listen to the cd, an hour later it was at the pawn shop. While the concept itself is stupid, the covers themselves were even worse. The cover for crush and candy were terrible. Everything else sucked aswell. And what the hell is Thrice doing on this album in the first place. Thrice is one of my all time favorite bands and then I see them cover Send Me an Angel and I nearly gagged. I'm tempted to beat up the guy who created the concept for this cd. People if you have any true taste in music, save the 14 bucks this cd costs."
2,pop pretending to be punk goes pop,"I was not impressed with this CD. Sadly, most of the covers sound quite a bit like the original.If you are looking for a good punk CD, I do not recommend this one. Most of the bands in my opinion are not very good anyway. If you do, unfortunatly, like some of them, you may want to check this CD out. And may god have mercy on your soul.But what would have made this CD really neat is if Avril Lavigne did a cover of one of her own songs. It seems to me that is sorta the same level as most bands and songs on this CD."
1,CORNY ASS SONG.....THAT BULL IS FOR KIDS TO LAUGH AT!,MAD CORNY! NICK CANNON IS A CLOWN! THAT'S KIDS STUFF! (SO EMBARRASED I DON'T WANT TO EVEN SAY NO MORE)
5,My pops might not like him but I do,This song is tight. It may not be the most original or the most creative ever but he got beat. The dude knos what hes doin. He funny and now hes gonna prove himself as a rapper. I hope that Nick Cannon knos that hes gonna go far. The dudes tight.
4,Good job Mr. Director,"I have seen ""Romeos"" on a screen in a small cinema and was quite impressed as I didn't think it would be such a good flick. I am not very into transgender cinema, so it's only a second film I saw in this matter. The first will be amazing ""Transamerica"".""Romeos"" is a story about intolerance and fight against it, about seeking for love, about the importance of friendship. The story has no flows and all actors did great job. What do you need more?Two thumbs up."
3,it's ok,"The plot is interesting. It revolves around a transsexual woman who is about to have the surgery when she falls in love with a gay man. Intriguing and deep, but involving as well."
3,Not a bad movie,This is what I have come to expect from most gay movies made with a low limited budget. I liked it and I will watch it again.
3,"Good manual, though needs revision.","This laboratory manual is very concise and easy to read. The topics range from antibody production to protein/enzyme conjugation, with step by step instructions and formulations. Previous to most topics is given a fairly thorough background. One drawback is the fact that this book is nearly 20 years old (pub. 1988) and lacks a significant amount of progress made in the areas of homo and heterobifunctional linkers, PEGylation, and antibody engineering. Given a good price however, this would be a good reference manual."
1,Huh?,"I started viewing this movie because of the good recommendations, I was cheated. Supposedly an end of the world movie but I didn't see it in the parts that I watched. This movie goes from bad to worse and then gets even worse. What is this movie about? Is there a point? It made no sense to me, seems to me that it's an Angsty movie about teenage angst, with extra angst and more teenage angst thrown in just to make it more Angsty. I kept trying to find a good spot in this film or at least something that would indicate what was going on, never happened. Apparently the director was smoking 'pregnant guppies' while he was filming, because this movie makes no sense at all, and probably wouldn't get better (even if you smoked a 'pregnant guppy'). Just don't bother, watch a test pattern or snow on you TV instead."
5,Very good,"a bit abstract at first and dull and boring but it gains interest and pace as you watch, a very good thought and idea behind it of not treating this world badly and wonder at all the little things but some weird ideas in there also. overall a good movie and shot very well"
1,This movie is the worst thing that has ever happened to me!,"This movie isn't for fans of the bizarre, but for fans of the nonsensical. I liked Donnie Darko, some Lynch (Twin Peaks), as well as Felleni and this in no way compares to any of the aforementioned. Don't waste your time or money...simply terrible!"
3,Sexualized Children,I thought this book was a bit too technical for typical parents. It also leaned more towards the fact that these children where sexually abused themselves which isn't always the case. It leaned more towards problematic families in general. This book has more of a one sided point of view then I expected.
1,Terrible Pans!,"I have never bought a cheaper set of pans in my life. These are so lightweight and the bottom of them are peeling off...the coating. I do not own a dishwasher, so they are just cheap...My husband is a cook and I wanted to surprise him with a new set of pans and how dissapointing this IS! THESE pans cost over 100 dollars and I would buy them for 10-20. My only 100 dollars for xmas and this is what I got for my husband. It has made me cry! Don't buy these!!!!!"
3,"Cheap, light and gets the job done","Bought these because Amazon had a deal that we couldn't refuse. Ended up with a lightweight set of cookware that is very handy for dishes that require frequent transfering between pots. The lightweight pan is also great for flipping omlets and pancakes. Some details are not well executed (i.e. hard to clean areas near handles), but fine given the price paid. Not sure how long they will last, but so far they are a fine and often preferred to our Calphalon set that cost many times more."
3,Good for vacation home or RV,"I have had Farberware Millenium pots in the past, so i was going with name when i saw this set.The pots are a bit on the thin side. They scratch easily.The biggest plus are the lids. They make great stovetop popcorn."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I returned this item because it was not as I expected. Looking at the picture, I assumed the frying pans would be much larger. This item may be good for a couple just starting out especially if they are not thinking of having any children."
5,great product,great cookware for a great price. glass lids allow you to see what's cookin'. good choice!
3,worked for a while,Two years later and still using this set except now the bottoms of the pans is peeling off and I just had to throw one pan away. For the short term use and the price it was worth it. But now I will be buying piece by piece and will spend more for long term quality.
3,"Not the greatest, but not bad too","I wont say its the best stuff on market, on the other hand for a bachelor like me this thing is quite good. The non-stick is not the highest quality and products may scratch easily. But as I say its not bad."
5,Awsome!,"I love this set! normally it cost so much more for this set, but I got for a awsome price! Thanks a lot! A+++"
2,How desperate are you?,"Look, these are simply not high quality pots and pans, and are not comparable to Farberware's other lines, a la Millenium and Classic. This is Farberware's el cheapo brand designed to appeal to Wal-Mart shoppers and college students.The pans are thin, the nonstick coating will not last and you'll find they scratch rather easily.However, they are an absolutely fabulous deal hear on Amazon, which is why they get 2 stars, not one. For somebody who wants the absolute cheapest set of not-quite-disposable pans they can find, you've come to the right place.I would recommend, however that you buy one or two of the Calphalon Commercial or Farberware Classic special priced items here instead. It will last a lot longer, look a lot nicer, and cook food better. Ultimately, the cost of cookware is a tiny fraction of the cost of the food that you will be cooking with it -- pennies a meal. Isn't it worth it to have decent quality?"
3,Great...for a bargain starter set,"Well, as the title suggests, this is not the pot set if you're an aspiring Emeril! If you're in college, starting out in your first apartment, or in need of a starter set to get the basic cooking done as a newly-wed couple (as we are), then this set is for you!...especially at the great bargain prices of Amazon.com.Don't expect the heavy weight, don't expect flawless concentric heating, and even the balance leaves a bit to be desired. But eggs, omelette, rice, pasta, chili, curry, or braising/browing meat, and this set does the trick! It definately covers all the basics, I would say more than adequately, with excellent fast heating of all pots and pans and well-fitting lids.FYI - the utensils (or should I say flexisticks) are FLIMSY!! DO NOT attempt to lift heavy wads of spagetti, rice, or stews with the spoons or even a heavy omelette with the ""spatula"" :-) ... boiiinnngggg! Get a wooden spoon ;-)"
3,great for college dorms,"not as sturdy as my last farberware set, but the price was a huge difference too.really take care with the use of non-plastic utensils these scratch easy.the glass tops are hard to keep clean under the rims."
5,Good buy!,"I love this set! I was hesitant about ordering a set that was this cheap, but I said what the hey and ordered it anyway. I'm glad I did. I LOVE the handles & lids on this set! The lids fit tightly and allow you to see what you're cooking. The handles are very comfortable (both grip wise and they don't heat up). The set is just a heavy enough gauge to cook well. So far I have only kudos for this inexpensive set.By the way: if you're looking for a dutch oven type pot that is just a wee bit smaller than the usual huge honker the 4 1/2 qt pot is great! I use it a lot. I've just ordered a second set."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with one of the other reviewers. The Next Gen. Companion pales in comparison to the DS9 Companion.The photos in the Next/Gen companion are poorly printed. The episode summaries are minimalistic.Overall it seems the Next/Gen Compannion was rushed. I guess its good if you need to look up a quick/basic fact about an episode, but it doesn't have the WOW factor that the DS9 Companion has"
4,A Great Thing To Have,"Some of the best books dealing with Star Trek are the companion guides. Star Trek: The Next Generation companion guide tells of how The Next Generation started and how Patrick Stewart and the rest of the cast were chosen to be on the show. Then it goes into detail about every episode by seasons and tells what they are about and some interesting info on each episode like what special guest were on and behind the scenes stories. And at the end of the book they have an index of what page the episodes you might want to look at are on. I love the book because when I look on TV schedules and see the names of the episodes coming on that day, I can look it up in the books and see what that certain episode it is and if I would want to tape it or not. I tape a lot of Star Trek TNG and episodes! In this way it becomes very helpful! on. Then it tells about the movies from Generations to Nemesis! Giving in depth detail of the movies"
5,I bet you didn't know that!,"Wow. This is the most comprehensive episode guide I have ever seen for any show. EVER. A good episode synapsis followed by some interesting preductin notes makes this one of the best books associated with Star Trek. I picked this book up, along with my copy of the Rules of Aquisition at Star Trek: The Experience in Las Vegas *PLUG PLUG*, so I don't know about availability. But, let me tell you, if you like the Next Generation, and you have every episode on tape (like me), you need this book. Buy it now! (By the way, I bet you didn't know that Geordi's origional shipboard specialty was like as the ""starship school for children."")"
4,A nice update,"I previously own an older version for this book, and is agood and refreshing guide, including all Next generation season by season information(including last movies)Unfortunatelly as it predecesor, is not hard cover, but that can be forget.A good buy for fans like me."
5,A must for trekkies,"This book, or should I say companion, covers all seven seasons of Next Generation and Generations with great details of on- and off- the screen of each individual episode. Even you just like Next Generation but like to know more, this is a must."
2,Not a good book in my opinion,"If you want just the ""rehash"" of the episodes you already know, get it.It was boring!"
3,Not bad for the price,"I got this for my small size old Thermos brand gas grill. It's pretty sturdy for something that sells for such a low price. The spit rod ships in two pieces, with a threaded coupler in the middle. I found it to be strong enough at the joint, and have had no problem with that. To make it fit my small grill, I had to cut about 10 inches off the tip end of the shaft and then grind a new point with my bench grinder. The motor is fairly quiet and the rotation speed of the shaft is very slow, between one and two RPM. For less than $20 I'm happy with it, and have enjoyed quite a few chunks of meat cooked on it.One con is that there is only one pair of forks supplied, and really you need at least one extra pair that you will have to buy or find somewhere if you want to cook more than one piece of meat at a time."
2,Shoddy Compilation,"This is NOT the single-disc Louis Jordan retrospective to get. MCA's ""Best of"" CD is quite definitive, and if you want more you should delve into the actual albums or the double-CD anthology 'Let the Good Times Roll'.'20th Century Masters: The Millenium Collection' is a poor, gimmicky series, and this Louis Jordan installment is particularly short."
4,Just what I wanted,"Just received the hardcover 3rd edition directly from the author, who also signed it and included extra loose leaf paged info. Loved flipping through it (wish all pics were in color though). I Still need to read it, but I'm sure I will love it. It lists all the movies and shows in order (even shows I had no idea Rankin/Bass were involved in). It also has collectors items and memorabilia. There's not much behind the scenes info, but it is packed with photos. Still worth it for Rankin and Bass fans. Thanks Rick your awesome! P.S. It also includes soundtracks that were released and posters etc. Got to love it."
1,An absolute dissapointment.,"Having been one of Rankin Bass biggest fans, I looked forward to reading more about behind the scenes and technical info. How dismayed I was to find that the bulk of this book is no more than plot synopsis of each of the R\B shows. tell me how there is no behind the scenes photos of a set piece to show the size of the actual figures used. I remember as a child going on a tour of the NBC studios, and seeing the figures from rudolph in a glass case. I was surprised @ the size of the abominable snow monster. I was hoping for seeing more of this type of thing. There is one picture of somebody holding donner, and thats it. we`ve seen these shows countless times, we know the story backwards..yet story synopsis takes up 99% of this book. the photos are very small, mostly black & white. It is obvious that the author is a novice, shame on him & shame on me for spending $ on this amateurish attempt of writing about a company (Rankin Bass) who deserves better treat ment than this."
2,Absolutely no Christmas in July ...,"Pictures and plot summaries aplenty, but very little history, far less insight and absolutely no Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July. How can one possibly forget Ethel Merman in a cowgirl outfit riding an ostrich in a (literally) flying circus?"
1,Do not buy!,"The chest area should be forgiving, which it's not, smashes that area. And it rides up to easy. I should have returned it but didn't. I do not recommend this cami shaper!"
5,I wear this almost everyday!!!,"I know some folks said this doesn't have enough support, but they must be much bigger than me. I'm average and this is perfect... well, almost. If there was just a tad more padding around the ""headlight"" area it would be perfection (but for those of you who don't have that issue it's great! It is comfortable, supports, and did I say comfortable? It doesn't make the bulgy stuff that normally gushes out with bras apparent at all. Nor do you get the uncomfortable feeling in either the strap area or ribcage area when you sit down. The soft taupe is perfect for a tan or just slightly tan body to wear something white with because then you see absolutely no bra through... just blending with your own skin.I highly recommend this!!!!"
2,Not so great,"Had no problem with the fit, however it did not stay put. It was midway to my chest within an hour. Would not reccomend."
2,barely there shaping tank,"I was so excited to get this product which was shipped quickly. However, the tank top is awful. It rides up to the waist after wearing it for five minutes, creating a roll around your midsection.I am not overweight and just wanted something to wear instead of a bra. This is not what I wanted, discomfort and an additional roll. Would not recommend at all."
4,Smooth toners,"Knew it would not fit, I am a larger size; but decided to take the risk. My cousin benefited...she loved it and said it was very comfortable"
2,"Uncomfortable, too compressing, unattractive.","Overall I was not impressed with this shapewear. I must admit, I am new to shapwear tanks this being my first purchase, however for my first time I was not impressed. It's great for those bra bulges in your back area (smoothes it out) but not too great in the chest. It's too compressing in that area for my preference. And the neckline is too high and noticeable when you wear v-neck tops. I also don't care for the cheesy lines and crisscross designs on the front either. It was not very comfortable, but I guess that's the price you pay for wearing shapewear. I will not buy this item again."
3,Ab support,"Bought the garment for some ab support. Easy on, easy off. After several washings, the garment didn't stay in place at the hips and began to roll."
3,It's OK,"It fits well, but the bottom tends to roll up. I like the no-line look, but would prefer it had something to make it not roll."
1,not what I expected,I thought this would have more support. I wanted it in place of bra doesn't work I have nothing else to say
2,This thing is pretty awful,"I read the reviews suggesting that this shaping tank rides up, but I decided that wouldn't happen to me. I was wrong. I cannot get this tank to stay put (I even tried tucking it in, which usually helps with shapewear). No luck. I wouldn't recommend this tank, since shapewear doesn't do much in the way of shaping when you're pulling it down every 5 seconds.For what it's worth, I have a well-defined waist and hips, so that might influence the riding/rolling up. Maybe if your shape isn't hourglass this won't be as much of a problem."
2,"They should call this ""barely smoothes""","So I bought a medium, my normal shirt size being 5'5. It fit, but barely. If I lifted my arm it rode up. I decided to return it because my body virtually looks the same with it on and off. Waste of money!"
1,Skip this one - not worth it.,"Bought this book based on reviews. Skip this one. Physically, the book, while it's got a nice cover presentation, is about 4 1/2 x 6 1/5 and has about 50 pages of very sparse text, plus a checklist at the end. Not even any pictures. Mostly a simple listing of the birds he sees during random days around camp. No deep meaning, no great insight. Quite disappointing considering the potential of the topic. I can't imagine who this was written for."
2,Overpriced and underwritten,The book costs $9.95 but consists of little more than slightly edited versions of what the author put on his blog. The idea behind the blog is intriguing: being a naturalist in a war zone. The book is really a series of reports: he saw such and such birds in such and such a place. The poignancy of what he is doing never comes through. And the price? Ridiculous. It's worth maybe $5. Read it at the bookstore.
4,A Story of how God used one man to move mountains,The book follows the life of Leonard Coote as he went to Japan and Changed a nation. He founded Emmanuel Church and International Bible College in San Antonio Tx ([...]).
4,wrong item,the product I got was the wrong jewelry cleaner it is the original cleaner it was not for pearls or gems. It was labeled pearls and gem cleaner by the person I bought it from. I will keep it any way for my other jewelry.. It says in the back of the jewelry cleaner not to use it on gems and pearls....
4,I've only used it once.. seems great so far!,"The product came so quickly.. I was very happy about that. It also had good instructions, and was packaged well. Like it very much for cleaning pearls."
2,Not the best,This stuff is expensive. Especially considering how well it works. A little lemon joy and warm water works much better and does not leave a film behind. Will keep looking for a safe cleaner.
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the Zenmed products, although they feel nice on the skin they haven't helped with the rosacea which was the reason I bought the product. There has been no alteration in the appearance of the redness of my skin, some people had more or less instant results and others after a couple of weeks and I have been using it morning and evening for over three weeks.I will use the rest of it up and see if there is any change."
4,Southern fried granny says,"Have had roscea for @ 15 years (since menapause) and nothing worked, not laser, creams, lotions, perscriptions; but this product has calmed the redness and I will continue to use it."
4,so so for rosacea,The plus is the cleanser is very emollient and rinses well. I don't know if these products do much for my rosacea but I like the moisturizing effect. A bit expensive.
2,Disappointed,"After a week using it twice a day my face is still red and bumpy, I wasted my money on this product. I was hoping it would help."
5,It works.,I am in my early thirties and and had tried several treatments for rosacea and acne. Although my symptoms were relatively mild it was something that really bothered me and over the last 6 months or so various treatments including antibiotics and creams had little impact.This is the first product that actually made noticeable difference. My cheeks have almost cleared up. Don't expect miracles but it has improved my skin after two month of use. Hope it works for you too. Get well!
2,Sadly Dissapointed,"I purchased this set to address mild to moderate rosacea, mostly on my cheeks. The cleanser is poor. It leaves behind make-up, and doesn't make my skin feel much cleaner than I just splashed it with warm water. I even tried leaving it alone for 60 seconds to give it additional time to work, but sorry- no better. I haven't really seen much if any change in redness using the mask and serum. After three weeks, I am discouraged with the results. I will go on using it until it's finished, but certainly wouldn't buy it again."
5,Stunning,"Stunning film in every way. Confusing at first, but in the unraveling, you care about these people, the acting is amazing, the visuals are amazing, and if you have any propensity toward empathy, this film will kill you. One of the best I've seen in many years."
3,Not so comfort fit,This ring is gorgeous--BUT my husband said it wasn't so comfort-fit. The edges weren't round like most comfort fit bands. The edges were very sharp and irritated his finger. The ring was gorgeous though and the delivery was fast! I was overall happy with the company. We decided to exchange the ring for one that was more comfortable--didn't like the fact that $35 was charged for an exchange--but I do understand since the rings are custom made! Thanks again!
4,Just works,I've been using it for 2 years or so. It works well and you don't have to think about it.If it would automatically go from pause to stop after an hour or so then I'm sure it would save people some electricity. As it remembers the stop position it only costs and extra 2 seconds to get back to where you were.
2,Cheap quality,"Is it just me or is this one of the most cheaply produced units on the market? The slide out cd tray is so flimsy that I fear putting any pressure on it for fear it will break in half. The unit is loud when the dvd is spinning, but otherwise the picture quality is good. I had to relocate the unit on top of the tv instead of the tv stand for fear my son might accidently bump it the wrong way and break it."
1,QUALITY STINKS AND SO DOES JVC CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Had problems with the unit and did not want to send it back to Amazon. Called JVC customer service and received the total run around. On hold for 30 minutes and when the rep finally got on the phone, they were useless. Finally at my end, sent it back to the folks at Amazon and they were the pros. Great work Amazon......Terrible job JVC."
1,LOSER,Do not be tricked by the low cost on this one. Unit does not play Disney DVDs and other titles look pretty bad on my Sony Grand Vega.
1,Not recommending this book!,"I found this author's writing style confusing, and her descriptions got so meaningless that I began to skip them. I read a book a week, and I felt this was a real waste of time."
3,An interesting premise--that is never realized,"The story begins with an interesting question: if you were forced to choose between saving your own life or sacrificing yourself for your best friend, what would you do? Unfortunately, the author chooses not to explore the more meaningful impact of the decision and instead focuses on the excrutiating minutia of one character's future 'life.'The book is a quick read and I was curious to find out how things would turn out but, in the end, I was left very unsatisfied. I never really enjoyed the author's style of writing. I found her analogies, metaphors and descriptions to be trite, contrived and somewhat juvenile. The novel's saving grace was its premise, which I kept hoping would be discussed. Unfortunatley, it never was."
3,Almost amazing,"This is the type of book that completely hinges on the last 30 pages. So many odd things happened throughout the book, I was dying for a great ending that would wrap up the story and give an explanation for all the the crazy happenings. However, the ending never came. I was left to image for myself why Diana acted the way she did... and for the life of me, I couldn't seem to figure out why. The reader is shown so many of Diana's thoughts it sometimes seems as though we are intruding on her fractured mind. Diana's mind is so odd... I couldn't help but wondering if this book was going to end up with Diana in a psych ward.In conclusion, this is a beautifully written book that was incredibly intruiging, but very unsatisfying."
3,Interesting...sort of,"As an avid reader, this book was pretty predicitable. I had the end figured out about 1/3 of the way through. Though, if you are looking for a quick vacation type read you should still pick it up. It's not bad, just more fluff than I was expecting."
4,Oh stop your arguing.,"Does the genre really matter? Just listen to whatever sounds good and to heck with all the bollocks out there. Now stop whinning about whether these are true punk bands and tell people whether this is a good buy or not.Thursday and Taking Back Sunday have excelent tracks on here. Probably the best two. Most of the other songs tend to grow on you. But the first two tracks I mentioned warrant a buy on their own. Not for $14 bucks, mind you. Maybe $9.99 or somewhere around there. I'm sure you could find this cheaper at an actual store.If you don't like acoustic music or any of these bands then you should probably spend your money on something else."
5,wicked!!!!,"this cd is a must have - there's loads of great bands out here like finch, surgarcult, thrice, ataris , yellowcard etc... letters to you (finch) and eight of nine (ataris) are my most fave tracks from the album. buy this it's really sweet, it has got a raw sound but it still is punk rock in more ways than one."
2,meh,"I hate to participate in this genre debate but I will anyway. To me, punk/hardcore is DIY, basement/house shows, we don't need your highly record label we can support ourselves because we're all a community. That said, to me, this isn't punk. But whatever, if you like these bands BUY IT! Do it!however, if you want to hear some amazing acoustic punk bands (sometimes compared to folk music), listen to:Ghost Mice, Defiance OH, Operation: Cliff Clavin (they have one acoustic album), Best Friends Forever, This Bike is a Pipe Bomb, (obviously) Against Me!, Sawwheel, Madeline, and if you like mellow acoustic mixed with powerful screams check out the mighty (MIGHTY) 1905.1905 is absolutely killer, these kids have such impeccable talent and great lyrics... goosebumps!:) peace kids, don't hate each other, enjoy everything the undeground has to offer!"
2,Disappointing,"This cd took forever to come out and then it broke my heart. I love the bands on the cd but I think the songs are a let down. Many of the songs you've probably already heard. I love acoustic music but I don't think the acoustic versions of these songs demand any special attention, better yet a cd. I would not recommend buying this."
2,bad idea,Theres a reason that these bands are considered punk it's because none of them can sing. Most of the vocals on this CD are horrible. Punk songs just should not be done acoustic. I new this CD would not be great especilly after seeing Thrice play an acoustic set at the warped tour. Stick with these bands real albums this CD sucks and was a bad idea from the start.
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"This just makes me want to laugh.... First of all, half the bands on this cd are not even punk- Yellowcard?!?!?! The Starting Line?!?!?!? The Ataris?!?!?!?!?! ah, NO! Second,, I don't think punk was made to be ""acoustic"",, did you ever hear Black Flag make an acoustic cd? I think not!If the 1 star is worth anything, its for From Autumn to Ashes, though they are not punk, they are hardcore, they're still way better than The Starting Line anyday...first Punk Goes Pop and now this.... what will they think of next? :)"
3,What about Coalece?,"Wow, didn't expect to see Coalesce on this cd. I love Coalesce for their strange time signatures and dirty vocals. How cool is it to hear them do an acoustic song, complete with harmony, and some dirtiness at the end. They even held a 4/4 time sig. for a whole song. Blue Collar Lullaby knocked my sox off, but that may be because i am a huge Coalesce fan. The rest of the cd is ok, thats it."
5,This isn't really PUNK goes Acoustic,"It's more of EMO goes Acoustic. But Emo is amazing anyways. I love this CD, its so great."
4,scenes are lamee!!,"1st this cd is a good one for the most part.2nd, scenes are lame!3rd, everybody has a right to there own oppnion, so if you hate me, just go beat up some loser kid in your neighborhood and tell them that some loser online pissed you off.4th everyone has different tatse in music, let them listen whatever they want. i wouldn't label this cd as ""punk rock"" (genres are diff. they catogorize the music). but thats is just my opnion.buy this cd if you like rufio,yellowcard, thricecurse this cd if you hate it, but leave the people who like this cd alone."
4,Good revenge/redemption story...,"I think of books/novels as a ride. What kind of journey the book takes you on depends on the story, of course. This one takes you into the seedy sections of society where violence reigns. The characters are realistic, the violence swift and bloody. I was a little skeptical because of the 99 cent price but I'm glad I read it. The author's prose was very good, nice flow, great description without overdoing it.I would definitely read another of Waiwaiole's books."
1,so easy to put down,"Loving gay-themed fantasy novels as much as I do I am awfully sorry to give such a low rating to one of them, this included.The world created here by Mr Donaghe is interesting and the plot really has potential. Moreover it is extremely clear how much care he put in his work, giving us a novel that is neither short, nor vain, nor hurried.Unfortunately it is also lenthy more than just long, excruciating more than slow and wordy more than meaningful.We are given whole paragraphs when simple sentences would suffice, long explanations instead of hints and this happens again and again.I had to abandon it after little more than a hundred pages, displeased with the author and with mysel, not a nice feeling.By the way, one could legitimately feel displeased with the publisher too: the book awfully expensive, massive, hard to read, printed with a very small font and badly bounded so that pages tend to fall out."
5,Bloody good fun. Bela Lugosi would approve.,"I love pretty much anything with Vampires, and this such an inventive book! There's a great running gag regarding the Count's accent. Two of the characters think he sounds Hungarian. I died laughing! The Count remains the best dressed undead creature around, and he's looking for a new girlfriend. You just KNOW there's going to be trouble!"
4,capts boom boom,wasnt super scary but good story line cant wait till i get the next book charaterswe're pretty good but dracula's dreams caused the great war is kinda deep but it worked that something this evil as dracula could cause it to happen but being judas wow now thats deep good book liked it
5,Ladies First,"I got to give props to EVE,cause she put females back on the map. I think the album is off the hook,and if she keeps it up she'll be around for a while. I'm also digging the track ""Love is Blind"", because there are so many women who are in that type of situation,that can relate. I also like the collaboration track with 'Missy',as well as the dope beats. Keep doing yo thing, cause ain't nothing like a RUFF RYDER! ONE LOVE CALI STYLE!"
5,Shes the bomb.,Shes the first lady to come out in rapp and be herself and represent like a true woman and not a hoe or freak like little kim.
4,GET THIS CD!!,"HEY EVERY1 EVE'S CD ""RUFF RYDER'S 1ST LADY"" IS AWESOME!! ESPECIALLY TRACKS 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, AND 18. SO BASICALLY THEY ARE ALL GOOD. YOU SHOULD REALLY GET THIS CD. IT'S REALLY A GREAT CD."
4,SHE GOT SOME SKILLS,WHEN EVE FIRST CAME OUT I WASN'T REALLY FEELING HER MUSIC BUT I WENT BROUGHT IS ANYWAY BECAUSE I LIKE THE RUFF RIDERS CREW AS A WHOLE THE ALBUM ITSELF WAS A'IGHT THERE ARE A FEW TRACKS THAT MAKE YOU SIT UP AND PAY ATTENTION LIKE LOVE IS BLIND SHE GOT SKILL AND BEING WITH THE RR I THINK SHE'LL SE AROUND FOR A WHILE
5,Eve has the best voice and I luv her songs!,"This is a really good pick, because Eve is a really good singer"
4,I think Eve's cd is bang'n,The song that caught me to listen to EVE's album was (I think its called)what ya'll Ni**as want. That song is so tight.Another artist that be bang'n is ''KABOO''
5,RUFF RYDA'S LADY..,"EVE,I REALLY LIKE YOUR ALBUM.. YOU ARE A BIG INFLUINCE ON ME AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, YOU ALWAYS HAVE POSITIVE ATTITUDES ABOUT THINGS YOU SAY/DO, AND MY FAVORITE SONG ON THA ALBUM IS (LOVE IS BLIND).. THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD SONG, AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I LOOK UP TO YOU SO MUCH AND STAY UP GURL.. ONE!"
3,"Had some good ones, expected original # 18","It had a couple of good songs but I expedted to hear the original "" What Ya'll want"". I didn't like the remix of ""what ya'll want"" what was the point of that hispanic chorus it sounded bad. Don't get me wrong I like hispanics I plan to marry one and most of my closest friends are hispanic it just made this song sound bad"
5,The first lady,"Eve is very talented and I love her new CD it's phat I especially like the song love is blind because,it speaks the real and nothing else all the songs are live on that disc her style of flow is tight but she's trying to be another Foxy or Lil' Kim the guys might like it but I don't but,her album is phat ."
2,On the Fence,"If you look up the word ""hypocrisy,"" you should see a big photo of Eve's debut release.On most of the songs, including ""Gotta Man,"" ""Stuck Up"" and ""Ain't Got No Dough,"" she praises thugs and hustlers to the fullest. Then, on the track ""Love Is Blind,"" she criticizes -- and eventually slays -- a man who batters his girlfriend and sends her to an early grave.Given her fascination with hoodlums, the sentiments of this song, poignant as they may be, are hard take seriously.On her first effort, Eve does, however, show potential as a lyricist. The only problem is that to notice it, you have to cut through the lame sing-song choruses (""Gotta Man,"" ""Philly, Philly,"" ""Love Is Blind"") and way-too-long list of guest appearances."
2,Take it or leave it.,"If you like club tracks from Swizz Beats, then this is for you. If you like the ultra-hard rhyming style that Ruff Ryders has come to epitomize, then here's your album. But if you are craving real hip hop, then look elsewhere. Sad to say that Eve has real skill, but sharing time with the rest of her clan (DMX, et. al.) subtracts from what could have good been a solo debut. Instead, Eve fans will be left wondering about what might have been."
5,It was over before it had started !!! RIDE OR DIE !!,"Ruff-Riders is the team that controls the 1999-2000 scene!If your not riding ""RUFF"" your not ""RIDING"" at all!!!"
4,Good debut ...,"This CD was a great CD. Swizz KEPT the beats laced. Eve kept the lyrics hot. The only problem I had was the ""What Y'all Want"" remix, and the number of skits. Shok shouldn't have even produced that track. Swizz should've come back with another Cuban-laced beat. This should go gold, if not platinum. Ruff Ryders is platinum plus, baby! RYDE OR DIE!"
5,Great,"Eve has proved herself to be one of hip hop's greatest femal rapper.All her lyrics are tight.The beats are off the hook.I love the songs""Let's Talk About It""and ""Love Is Blind"".The skits are so funny.You have to get this album.I thought is was going to be stupid and I would just listen to it once and never again but now I will always play this tape on my walkman.I am a total music critic and take my advice get this album.Aiight.ONE LOVE TO ALL MY PEEPS IN BROOKLYN YA HEARD."
4,Eve has the skills and ability...,"Ruff Ryders First Lady is full of not only high energy beats and some of the dopest lyrics I've even heard from a woman, but definately one of the top rap albums released in 99. Her ability to flow with all sorts of style and beats makes her lyrics hit even harder and harder as the CD goes on...and it doesnt hurt to have the LOX and DMX hitting up some joints for ya. Their really is no downfall I'm just leaving room for improvement cause her rap is only gonna get better...so watch out. Buy this....no joke!"
5,She's the bomb,"Look out Foxy Brown, Lil'Kim and all you other women artists because Eve is enetering the building back up cause she'll blow you away."
4,This is a must get for any Ruff Ryder fan,"This album is hot. Eve knows what to give her fans. She lays it down for the ladies also. People are talking about how many cameos she has, but that depends on how you feel about cameos. She's proven time and time again she can make an album by herself to me, so when she has another artist on the track it just enhances her flow. On the down side this album is too short espically since it was pushed back(The album is not even 55 min)."
4,Great acoustic versions,"This is an excellent representation of what you get when you put some guys in front of the mic at a radio station and tell them to have a little fun. If you are looking for electric, polished studio versions then this is not for you; if you want to know what it would be like to hang out on Donavon's deck and have a few drinks while they mess around, you will love this EP. One other name that should have been on the cover is Zack Gill - the frontman of ALO adds a great element with his accordian, and track 6 is an amazing version of his band's ""Girl"" unplugged. If you understand that these are recordings from their friend Kelly Slater's studio and that it's all about having fun, this CD will be in your regular rotation...If you are more into a plugged-in live performance with a full band, give a listen to Donavon's Abbey Road Sessions album."
3,you will pick up your guitar,"you will immediately want to pick up your guitar and hope to jam music with your buddiesa world with their music will make you feeel that what more do you need, besides a gang of loving friendslife is wonderful when music is in your cells!"
2,Disappointed,"Somehow I hoped for more. I really like the Jack Johnson albumns I own, and had hoped that a live performance with these other two musicians would impress. It did not. Don't waste your money or time."
4,A little & nice-looking device,"This digital recorder is very convenient for me to bring it all day , and with easy operation. I really like this a lot and now I suggest you to buy one,then you'll find out that the recorder is very useful."
3,Good sound in a small package,"The sound quality is excellent and noise discrimination (separation of background noise from voices) makes taking notes or interviews with noisy backgrounds much better than anything else I have used.The only fault, and for me is ridiculous, is that Sony adopted a file format that will only function with windows. This makes it impossible to back up files on a computer that does not run Windows. It seems hard to imagine that they would have done this when there are numerous file formats that can be read by nearly anything."
4,Sony ICDSX46 - 128MB Digital Voice Recorder,So far so good. I haven't used to the maximum extent. I still have to explore all the features and the audio capabilities in a large crowd.
2,Still No Vista Drivers,"It works, but just no excuse for not having Vista drivers out. It's 8 months since Vista came out, and the only drivers out there are in Japanese. For the last 7 months, I called their tech support and got nowhere, then finally found info on their web site. Then they pushed their release back from June until the end of July"
4,"Love the recorder, hate the software","I love this recorder and never leave home without it: use it for interviews (excellent sound quality) and to listen to podcasts and so far, it's been very reliable. The only big problem is the software Digital Voice Editor 2. It's crappy, buggy, crashes all the time. It refuses to import certain types of podcasts (MP3 of 44 Mhz or more if I remember well.) The fact that Sony doesn't provide patches and updates for this awful software is pretty infuriating. I don't even know if it's Vista-compatible!"
2,Too small but software works great.,"This recorder is just to small. Its hard to get through the menu options and hard to use the buttons. The software and the USB interface works great. The reception range is limited and the play back quality is not very good. I guess if all you wanted was something real small it would be OK, but it just is not user friendly."
2,Buggy and you can get 24K maps for free,"This program does have some good features - but the interface is awkward and it crashes frequently. Also, the USGS web site provides free downloads of all 1:24,000 quadrangle maps. With a little trim and paste work you can get custom areas and you don't have to spend good money and not good software."
3,No backward compatibility. Very poor support -corrected,"UPDATE: In the end they send me a brand new version (not an update anymore) and it all worked out. I'm still using TOPO. :)I now have their latest TOPO! 4.5, but cannot use it with my California State series maps. I've been exchanging e-mails with their customer support and they basically just recycle cut and paste's from their web site. At first I took their instructions (often contradictory) seriously and did everything they said, but none of it works. To make sure I tried it on a different computer. No go. The software often hangs up for long time, so anything you try kills a lot of time. I think it is just a very badly written code with no backward compatibility. I'm going to start looking for another product."
1,Worst user interface that I've ever seen,"TOPO! has the worst user interface ever created. It doesn't follow the standard user interface designed by Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft.- There's no hand tool to move around the map--rather you have to move your cursor to the edge of the screen and click to push the map around. Hard to control and creates lots of cursor movement- The tool to draw routes is hard to control"
1,TOPO no longer supports Mac!,"After experiencing some problems with the route planning function, I contacted National Geo TOPO support. I was very bluntly informed that TOPO no longer supported recent Mac OS. Tough luck you're on your own!"
4,Great topo map for everyone that needs one.,"I bought this mapping software to conduct map surveys of potential hunting areas. It's a good software for that, but the thing that bummed me out was when I got the package, the CD's had fingerprints all over it. Clearly, the package was opened and returned. I don't have a problem buying second-hand stuff, but the seller shouldn't sell it as new if it's not."
3,Unstable on Windows 7,"I love the features of this product, but it has stability issues. I have a recent laptop running Windows 7. The product loads fine, but it crashes when I attempt to save files or open files - not very helpful, since my goal is to mark up maps for hunting purposes and save them to disk. I loaded the SW on a Sony PC also running Windows 7, and it works fine. I submitted a bug report over a week ago, and I got no response - not very inspiring. Its a great application, but you are taking a gamble if you have Windows 7."
5,This is my Gardening Bible.,"I thought I was getting a book that would negate the need for an entire shelf of gardening books, and it's true that I will probably never buy another gardening book. On the other hand, I must now buy books about Chicken Tractors, Worm Composting, Soil Building, How to Buy Land in the Country, etc. Now, I need to subscribe to a Permaculture magazine. And I need to take some Ecology courses. And . . . here I thought I was going to save money! :-) I couldn't be happier. Hemenway has disrupted my whole lifestyle for the better. There is enough info here to get me started on the right path, but he has only whetted my appetite for more information about permaculture. But at least I now have a pretty garden to sit in while I read those other books and munch on fruit I grew myself!"
5,permaculture at its best,"This book came highly recommended and justifiably so. This is an excellent reference book about permaculture. The Why. The how.This is applicable to many different situations, although, it would seem to be most applicable to those who have more than just a house on a typical small urban building lot. Not that you can't implement some of these changes even there to help create a great personal environment.And before you begin any of these projects, make sure you have your family's support. I got shot down as soon as I opened by mouth.The first thing to be aware of though, is that this will need a certain investment of time, $$, and WATER. Once started and going, pretty self-sustaining, which is the point. Wish I could get there. Wish we could ALL get there."
3,design needs improvement,This is a good set with multiple-purpose usage. But I was disspointed once I opened the package; the handles with the logo look cheap and of poor quality. The picture online is too small to show these details. I know it is 18/10 stainless steel and decide not to go through all the trouble to return them.
3,Heavy,This was a nice set if you are cooking for large groups of people and need some heavy duty cookware. Otherwise stay away if it is just for your house kitchen.
2,This item was a bit poorly made,I bought this collection about a year and a half ago and am left with the two spoons. The others I didn't like so much that I threw out and the other I suppose I could do the same for since they are discolored and too large to use.
5,AWESOME PHONE!,This is a great phone with all the features you could ask for. The handset is light and comfortable and has a headset jack if you want to free up both hands. The phone has excellent clear reception. I'm a tough critic and am glad to write that this phone is an awesome value that I am thrilled I found!
3,"Nice features, but sound is lacking","This phone had all the features I was looking for, but I returned it because of an echo you hear when you talk in the receiver. I wouldn't recommend it for this reason."
1,hmmmm,"Not only did i see this phone 10 bucks cheaper at Circuit City which really is 20 bunks after shipping, but its also not working properly. too large in size, echos, bad reach ( i got problems even only 10 yards away from the base station), speaker does not work well etc. all-in-all i wish i would have never bought it."
2,Not worth it,"In less than a month, most of the buttons letters or numbers faded away. The message recording sounds like the messages are in Suahili and the volume adjustment is almost not existant.Nothing good about this unit."
3,Slanted views,"Good details but a challenging read without the maps for ready reference. Unit and battlefield movement are difficult to follow and the antique map within the book is difficult to read easily so as to be useless in tracking the action of the story. Commend the author on the research for specifics behind actions on both Blue and Gray units. Suggest that the distain for the Southern side is a bit too obvious and this discolors the author's objectivity as a story teller of this event. Even to the casual observer, the incompetence of both sides with this battle is obvious. To paint the South in general and the Confederates in particular as a group of buffoons is to waste the reader's time if the objective is to understand what the motivations and dynamics of the battle were."
3,Like A Martini with No Olive,"This is just an excellent telling of the first battle of Manassas. The facts are accurate and the sequence of events is near perfect. Mr. Detzer clearly explains the positions of both armies throughout the book. BUT THE BOOK HAS NO MAPS. This makes it nearly impossible to relate to the author's information. How a book this good could not have maps is an author's and publisher's unacceptable omission. If the reader cannot constantly visualize the stone bridge, The Henry house hill, Matthews hill and other important locations, this will be a most frustrating read. To force the reader to have additional maps and go back and forth between reading and viewing makes the book totally unenjoyable for a reader that does not have a clear understading of the topography. The book is a 10. No maps pulls the rating to a 3. What a shame."
4,Nice... but no maps!,"Donnybrook recounts the story of the first battle of Bull Run, inclusive of the months leading up to it and the days immediately following it. The writing is good; the battle descriptions give a real flavor of the confusion of the combatants at all levels. Comparing the action here with battles later in the war is very instructive in terms of seeing how all levels of the military matured with experience.In terms of weaknesses, the dearth of maps is very unfortunate. Readers interested in following the action will - unless they already know the geography - need a supplemental map. Donnybrook contains just a single map (albeit printed twice), and that map lacks sufficient details and labeling to identify the majority of the critical sites mentioned in the text. Finally, the author scatters through the text a few uncalled for snide and/or cynical remarks about the motives and/or morality of various of the characters.A good introduction to the first Battle of Bull Run."
5,a really fun rug,"I bought this to decorate the bedroom of my son but it ended up in our leaving room as a play rug... My son loves the bright colors, the texture (really soft)and moving his cars on it. It was really a good buy.I would recommend to buy My Travel Town by Early Years as the cars in it are the perfect size for the rug ""streets and parking space""."
5,Great for my son's room,I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday and I've been very pleased with it. It is a good size but not so large that it won't fit in his room. We leave it out all the time since my son has a car theme in his room and it has held up very well over the year that we've had it. I simply vacuum it once a week or so and it looks just as good as the day I got it. My son enjoys playing with this rug with his matchbox cars and he especially likes the gas station pictured on the rug. The roads are just the right width for his cars. I would definitely recommend this rug.
4,Perfect for my little car fan,"We purchased this for our little boy's 3rd birthday. For the first week, he hauled it out to the living room every day. (After that we convinced him to leave it in his bedroom floor.) The size is perfect, big enough to really play on, but not so big that it's in the way in the room he shares with his older brother. The texture is quite soft so it's comfortable to play on, even in shorts. The details of the buildings are not overly specific, which allows him to decide whether certain ones are houses, or businesses, depending on the game he wants to play. He has cars ranging in size and type from Matchbox to 3 times that size and the roads work well with all of them."
3,Great for toddlers,My nephew enoyed his street rug. I was disappointed in the size. I have one for my daughter from years ago and it was double in size and less money.
3,"Love the games, quality not so great","I am thrilled with the choice of the games (Patriots,Dolphins, Falcons). Watching the games again helped me relive this great season. However, the quality of the DVDs was not the best. On each of them, there are parts where there is no sound. There is a disclaimer that the quality is based on the original broadcast, but I'm pretty sure there was sound! It isn't poor enough to mail it back. I would have loved a copy of the Redskins' game as well."
5,Must have this DVD,"Great, it's a must for every fan. Although is a pity not having this one on blu-ray format. Great games for a team of destiny. You'll enjoy very much watching them, that's for sure."
3,Who Dat!,"I have Saints Season Tickets and actually attended the New England and Atlanta Games. It is great to see the games again as they led to the Super Bowl victory. The 3 stars is because the games are not in HiDef as they were on broadcast TV. I know it can be done, because the Florida BCS championship DVDs that I have are in ""widescreen"". That being said, it was a wonderful season and I love having these games as a souvenir. WHO DAT!!"
5,Geaux Saints! Who Dat!,"As a proud member of the Who Dat Nation I get chills and goosebumps each times I watch these DVDs. We waited a long, long time to be able to say ""New Orleans Saints: Super Bowl Champions"" and I hope it won't be long until we're able to say ""New Orleans Saints: Two-time Super Bowl Champions."""
1,I wish I could give zero stars,"Let me start by saying that The Pax Cecilia are amazing. They have a zeal, and originality, mixed with such undeniable talent that they will be remembered for a long time. However, they didn't start that way; they were originally this: Autumn Wind Thesis.I purchased this CD with low expectations; I only wanted to understand where the band had come from. However, this is horrific. There's no sense of structure, nothing new, nothing exceptional; infact, there isn't even anything mediocre, or just 'ok.'This CD is terrible. I love 'Blessed Are The Bonds,' and I love the members of the band - they are amazing guys, and incredibly modest. I'm glad they were able to take this and grow to heights that are too high to touch by most musicians. I would never suggest anyone listen to this, though. This should be buried and forgotten. Let's all pretend Autumn Wind Thesis never existed. The Pax Cecilia were always The Pax Cecilia and never went by any other name. Good? Good."
3,When The Music Stopped,"When The Music Stopped was a heart-wrenching book, as the reader could feel the helplessness and hopelessness in each stage and step along the way of this disease. As a ""veteran"" caregiver myself, I could certainly empathize with Mr. Wright. When a loved one is terminally ill, many try to find the ""magic bullet"" to cure such disease. We all know there's usually no such thing as a magic bullet, but we can't help but grasp for any straw that might prolong our loved one's life even if only for a few days. A terminal illness is a roller coaster ride that takes one on such highs and lows and the end result is always the same."
3,Which version is this?,"The Errol Flynn version gets 4 stars, but it was not directed by Richard Fleischer. The Fleischer version only gets 2 stars, the twins are too old. Something is not right here, which one is it?"
2,65/45 watt bulbs not 65/55 as packaged,The packaging shows 65/55 watts but shows 65/45 on the bulb housing... Misrepresentation.The bulbs does work when installed though.
5,Comfort food and so much more!,"It's easy to see why this book was a recent winner at the Julia Child IACP awards! The Jamisons have amassed a fabulous collection of the great recipes we've all loved as we were growing up, as well as new ones to enhance anyone's repertoire. The scrumptious photos tempt anyone's taste buds! Lots of informative tidbits are packed in with all the recipes. So many delicious recipes, but we especially love the macaroni and cheese. Classic comfort food that's easy to make and really hits the spot. This book is great for novice cooks as well as the more experienced ones, and the Jamisons' research benefits all of us!"
2,What a boring cookbook!,"This was a book with great promise that turned out to be highly disapointing!There is nothing outstanding in this mundane collection of recipes that can't be found in an ordinary cookbook (Anything from Joy of Cooking to a Pillsbury anthology is just as useful). The recipe for German Chocolate cake is available in countless other volumes and every grocery store.I found the directions vague. The interesting historical facts are fun to browse through, but the lack of photographs make this a difficult cookbook to enjoy."
4,"Great size & quality, but cuts show big time","I do love this cutting board. The large size is perfect and doesn't crowd me when I need the extra space to cut a whole head of lettuce or something similar sized. It is easy to clean and doesn't slide on the counter when in use. I'm pretty careful of my cutting boards though, and this already shows ""worn"" spots where the cuts show up against the red color.It's still a great board and I'd buy it again; but maybe I'd choose a lighter color."
5,Cutting board,This product is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a separate cutting board to use for poultry. It works great and is very easy to clean up with after using. I would highly recommend this product.
4,Pretty Red Cutting Board,This is a great cutting board and its fun having red instead of the usual white. I use it every day.
3,OK - but only if you get a good deal on it,Found this pretty cheap at TJ Maxx. Thank goodness - it's OK - but gets old fast for the little ones. The music it plays isn't that stimulating and it's heavy and awkward for my son (18 mos) to carry around. Unless you get a really good deal on this ($15) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
2,Weird offering from the Mugler house...,"Okay, so here's the thing. I love most Mugler scents, having bought both A*Men and Pure Coffee and thought from those two scents that this house can do no wrong. So without having the 1st whiff of B*Men, I bought it based on some reviews, here and elsewhere. Holy Lord was I unpleasantly surprised when I recieved this bottle. Thank goodness I only went for the 1.7oz.(which was given away to a friends son, who loved it). There is some loud funky note that goes through the duration of this thing that I can not stomach. Now, mind you, I'm more than willing to rock an unconventional scent every now and again,(Kouros, Kyoto, Le Male, etc), but this thing I can't do. I can detect the same note in Xeryus Rouge(I think), but Rouge couples it together with softer notes to temper it down. I don't know, just my 2 cents. Please, sample before you buy.-Jeremy"
1,Larry David can't act.,Wow this is bad. I acquired it after a friend recommended it when we were talking about Seinfeld. Not even remotely in the same league.
5,Funniest Show on Television,Season 2 of CYE is arriving in June! Here's hoping HBO keeps the sets coming more frequently than they've done with Oz. Season 2 ranks up there and has some priceless moments including the doll episode! I would like to see more bonus features on the CYE discs...maybe outtakes or the ultimate idea...the cast roasting Larry!List of Season 2 episodes (air date):The Car Salesman (9/23/01)Thor (9/30/01)Trick Or Treat (10/7/01)The Shrimp Incident (10/14/01)The Thong (10/21/01)The Acupuncturist (10/28/01)The Doll (11/4/01)Shaq (11/11/01)The Baptism (11/18/01)The Massage (11/25/01)

5,Larry David has not lost a step,Can you tell me how one man can make everything he does really funny?Don't miss this season because it may remind you of every other seasonbut somehow someway it's always fresh and new. 5 stars again!!!!!
4,"Love this series, but 2nd season is not the best...","I've really been enjoying re-visiting the Curb Your Enthusiasm Series. When you have an opportunity to view them all, you realize 2nd season is not the best, but still worth the time."
4,quirky,"the Curb Your Enthusiasm series is for those who like quirky, eccentric behavior. It is about all the little irritations in life we don't talk about. It isn't necessarily laugh out loud humor but it will definitely make you chuckle while it strikes a chord."
4,"A Wonderful, Haunting, Exotic Soundtrack","The version of the Joni Mitchell anthem to disillusionment, 'Both Sides Now' sung in Khmer by the retro-Cambodian psychedelic band Dengue Fever alone is worth the price of this record. And the more I listen to it the more I love the rest of the album. I'd never heard any of this music before I saw the movie by chance on TV, and it's astounding, driving, wild stuff that instantly creates a world of its own. One verse of 'Mao Pena' (apparently ""Thanks a Lot"" in Khmer) and you'll be instantly transported to the back of a crappy Peugeot taxi some rainy night in Phnom Penh circa 1970. Just a great record!"
5,Great Soundtrack to a not-so-great movie,"Sorry, Matt, nothing personal. I was really looking forward to COG before I saw it, having lived in Phnom Penh for some time. So Maybe I was just expecting to much. I loved seeing people and places I know in it though... But the soundtrack is awesome."
4,Great Television,Excellent picture quality and great sound. I highly recommend this TV and Amazon.com has a great price. I compared similiar ones at local stores that were ranging from $700-$899. WOW! this TV is really heavy though.
5,The Previous Reviewer is Dead Wrong!,"As a secular American Jew, I find the previous reviewer's comments about Touring Israel to be just the kind of narrow perspective on the Middle East, the Bible and nomenclature that is causing most of the conflicts and problems in Israel today. This video is thankfully NOT a typical travelogue, but a very fair minded and balanced look at the region. I thought it did a very respectable job of presenting the beauty of Judaism to the viewer, while never ignoring the other faiths in the region. In short, there will always be people who will be upset at ANY presentation of the Middle East, and the above reviewers comments should not be allowed to stand without rebuttal. This is a program that will be greatly enjoyed by the Jewish community AS WELL AS Christians, Muslims, Palestinians, and those with an intellectual interest in the region. Beautiful cinematography, finely tuned narration and a very sensitive portrayal of a de-sensitized region."
3,A little small,A rather thin book with a lot of repeating of information. This sourcebook could have been written into a section of another sourcebook (it was that lacking in information). It would have been better to buy on of the larger (better written) Clan book. Too late.
4,These books are great!,This is an excelent book for information on clan Jade Falcon. But I'm more of a Wolf person so I gave it 4 stars.
1,Worst phone I have ever owned!,"This is the worst telephone I have ever owned. I base this mainly on the poor reception. It is difficult to hear and there is a lot of static. My previous 900 MHz AT&T worked much better and it was five years older. I only had to replace it due to ""child abuse""."
2,Sound drops off,"I purchased this phone for X-mas. At first this phone was great, but after 3 months we began having sound problems. While listening to someone, the sound drops lower and lower. There is a button for 'load', but this does not help. I keep pressing my ear harder into the phone to listen. Also the asnwering machine voice quality was great when we bought it, but now we have to place our ear to the speaker and play the message repeatly to hear the message. After 5 months with this phone, I am now looking for another phone."
3,"Great feature set, poor audio quality","The 9980 has the best feature set of any phone I found, including the capability to operate during a power outage. However, the handset is very difficult to hear, even at the highest volume setting. It seems to amplify room noise, making it nearly impossible to use around kids, dishwashers, etc. (No, I'm a 30-year old with excellent hearing ;-) The location and height of the Talk button make it easy to disconnect during a conversation. The quality of recorded messages is good, but the quality of the greeting is poor (some friends told us that they did not recognize our voices). All things considered, if you plan to use this phone in a quiet environment, it is a good value."
2,It crackles in my house,"I bought this phone on the strength of the reviews here. Maybe it works great for some people, maybe my phone is just damaged, but I had crackling in the handset even when standing right next to the phone, and occasional crackling in the answering maching recording.They both sounded like static or interference, but the 5 year old cordless phone the Uniden was replacing never once had problems with being in the exact same location.And there's no reason for having problems with the answering machine, that's hard-wired."
2,poor sound quality,"Nice features, but recorded messages are almost unintelligible, and the sound level of the handset is too low. You can increase the volume, but then it reverts to the low level volume for the next call. I'm now looking for a new phone because I'm tired of playing messages 5 times trying to understand them. A friend of mine has a Uniden and he has the same complaints."
1,burned out immediately,"I put these in and backed the car out off the garage for a test drive. First off I didn't think they were THAT much better than stock. They are better, I just expected more. I drove around the block, pulled back into the drive way and the bright or hi side of one burned out before I could get the garage door open."
2,Beware of offensive language and mature subject matter,"The Wolfs had been well-to-do until Mr. Wolf lost his job. He tried to find work, but couldn't. Consequently, the family ended up on the run, stealing to provide for themselves. Mary, 16, knows that her parents are not acting responsibly, and that her father needs help, but no one will listen to her suggestions. Her father physically and emotionally abuses her and, upon being refused welfare, shoots his wife. Mary, in self-defense, ends up doing the unthinkable -- shooting and accidentally killing her father.This book should be for mature readers only because of offensive language and subject matter that includes theft, abuse, and a description of childbirth."
5,A Book of magic.,"I thought this book was enchanting. The way she wrote it made you want to read more. The way she described the pictish child was very specific. This book was magical and exciting. It was not the kind of book with all describing and no adventure though. She managed to include both. I enjoyed the way she put the glossary in the back of the book. It helped me understand the books Scottish words, and it was fun to say them and nobody would know what I was saying!"
1,Not impressed,"I'm surprised people like this book. The writing is overheated, the story jumps around confusingly and it contains rather ridiculous claims. For example, early on, Hogge states that Henry VIII was motivated primarily by the fear that England would sink into civil war if he died without leaving a male heir. I didn't realize Henry had such noble intentions!I'm about a third of the way through and considering giving up, which is unfortunate because I usually inhale books from this period. It doesn't help, I suppose, that I just finished a book by Jasper Ridley, who does a remarkable job of providing reams of historical information within a cracking good story."
4,The terror of religion: Gunpowder and God in the 16th Century,"A well-written, if occasionally dry, account of religious terrorism in the 16th century.This is the story of the battle to try to return England to the Catholic Church. A battle being fought by stealth and by argument by Jesuit priests, where the might of Spain (the Spanish Armada) had failed.Many of the priests, and the English Catholics who gave them refuge, demonstrated incredible courage in a battle over faith that - from this distance - was always doomed to fail.Their mission was ultimately shattered by the actions of the Gunpowder Plotters.While the book is about the religious battle, it is equally about the building of a nation.Highly recommended to those who want more knowledge about the development of the English Church, as well as to those interested in exploring the links between politics and religion.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,Bikes hanging off to the side of the car!,"Great and simple rack IF you have a spare tire that is reasonably well centered on the back of your car. I have a Honda CR-V, the spare is on the right side - and even with the rack adjustment for non-centered spares, my bikes hung 8-10 inches off the side of he car. If you get this rack with a non-centered rack, get some orange visibility flags!"
1,Does NOT fit LARGE tires,"Be careful with this rack if you have large spare tires. I have 32"" BFG AT's on my Wrangler and 33"" Bridgestones on my H3. This rack fits neither of them. The top section needs to sit above the spare to lock into place, and tires larger than 30"" in my approximation just won't work. There is no vertical adjustment to the rack, only side to side for decentered tires. It's a shame because the rack itself when locked in properly seems very solid.When using the THULE vehicle fit guide, keep in mind that it's based on the standard size OEM tires on the base model of the vehicle. If you choose an off-road package with larger tires (and thus a larger spare), or if you switch to larger tires later (like many of us do), the THULE rack will probably end up being returned like mine did.I've since ordered a SARIS BAT rack, which also mounts to the spare tire. But it extends up and out, and doesn't need to settle part of it over the spare, so I'm hoping it works better."
4,Thule 963 spare tire bike carrier,"We just got our first chance to use the bike carrier and it is a quality product. The bikes stayed put and arrived in great condition. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer who stated that the first bike on should have the front wheel to the side that the spare tire favors. With our Honda CRV, the spare is to the right of center and that is the side for the front bike tire. I would also recommend you use the fabric strap included to secure bicycles. Bungie cords with coated hooks will also work.DK.... Hollywood, FL."
3,thule rack doesn't fit spare tire,this is a nice rack but should be modified to allow adjustment for spare tires wider than those on Hondas. I bought the rack specifically to fit a standard Jeep spare tire and still had to pay 95.00 dollars to have it lengthened to fit my spare.
3,Disappointed,"This is a great product if you don't ever upgrade your tires to something larger than 32""."
2,Works OK but some things to consider,"There's nothing wrong with this hose, so far it works fine and the coils come in handy when putting the hose away. But do consider that it's only 50 feet at it's longest, and the further you move away from the house, the coils pull back considerably... just like a rubber band would. This presented a major problem when I went to fill up our inflatable pool the other day... normally I put our old hose in the pool and I could walk away as it filled up on it's own, but with this hose I had to stand there and hold it, otherwise it would've sprung back towards the house from all the tension. Additionally, if you have a lot of winding pathways with delicate flowers in your hard, this is not the hose for you... as you absolutely cannot lay the hose down as you move about the garden... it just is one straight coiled line from the house to wherever you stand. Be forewarned."
4,mad girls in love,aren't we all a little crazy? I loved the characters and was so sad when the story ended. The Southern charm of the story is so evident and appreciated. I live in a small town and I could easily compare several of the characters in the novel to actual people. A great refreshing read.
3,Not as good as Crazy Ladies,"""Mad Girls in Love"" is not as good as ""Crazy Ladies"". It was mostly about Bitsy and her life. I didn't like how the chapters about the other characters weren't written in first person like in ""Crazy Ladies"". Only Bitsy got the first person treatment.I was rushing near the end of this book just to get finished."
4,Wacky women from Crazy Ladies return,"(3.5 stars) This is a follow-up book to Crazy Ladies, taking place in Crystal Falls, TN and follows 3 generations of women, one generation farther down than the previous book. The novel opens with Bitsy on the run from her abusive husband, with her baby in tow. Her mother, Dorothy, remains institutionalized, and writes letters to the First Lady, detailing incidents in her family's life (each one in turn over time). Aunt Clancy Jane is back with her hippie tendencies turning into crazy cat lady proclivities, along with daughter, Violet, who is off to college and medical school and seems to be the most sane of the bunch. The book spans the late 60's to the 80's as we watch these wild and wacky women go through their lives, some improving on their lives, some falling into the same patterns. This was a clever, amusing, and sometimes bittersweet novel of women of the South."
2,Not like Crazy Ladies,"I'm disappointed. Mad Girls in Love warps the characters of the first novel. Clancy, Dorothy, Bitsy and Violet - none of them seem the same. The author has abandoned the groundwork she laid so well in Crazy Ladies for an empty, boring sequel. There's nothing to get into here. The plot shifts so quickly and with no direction."
3,Just okay,"I felt the author dropped the ball in the last half of the book. I found myself skimming to the end. I didn't care for the letter writing, that was used to tell 10 years of the story. I also felt that she didn't develope the main characters. Some of the characters were dropped. If you are looking for a good read with some nice characters then read this. I wouldn't call it memorable, but I didn't hate it."
3,Takes some gettin' use to,"Although I purchased this book ""new"" it wasn't, for the price I couldn't really be too upset.This book can get a little confusing and I think you have to really get into it to follow. Not written like most books which is a good and bad thing. It is a cute book however, and not a complete waste of time! I don't think I would read other books by this author though."
5,Michael Lee West can write a great story!,"When I saw this book, I knew immediately that it was going to be a winner! Bitsy was a bit of a mess and the rest of her family just added to the mayhem. Michael Lee West never fails to delight me."
4,Good,"This poker set is good if you just want to have a basic poker set around for play with a few people. Nice enough, neatly packaged in a tin, great for beginners or people interested in having a go at the game."
5,Wonderful,"I'm not sure if better Shostakovich Piano Concertos exist on record, especially not on a single disc. Everything is recorded beautifully. There is real passion throughout the disc. You won't be dissapointed in this purchase. Highly recommended."
2,I have not noticed a difference,"I have tried a few different testosterone/energy-boosting supplements, looking for the best supplement to try help my energy levels and libido. According to the Thai people I know, Tongkat Ali (but known differently in Thailand) is nature's miracle pill for both. So far, after nearly finishing a bottle, I have noticed very little difference in my energy or libido levels. It just tastes like a non-acidic form of concentrated grapefruit juice."
1,Tongkat Ali - Liquid Extract 1oz,"Thought this product would be good, but it didn't do a thing for me. No statement on the bot indicating MG of product being consumed in a serving."
2,ratteling around in the box,the brush and the paint tube holders were loose in the box as the glue was dried up and the plastic holders would not hold to the box. SORRY
4,Actually worked!,"I had a slight mechanical problem with my hard-drive which rendered it useless, I then got a quote for GB800 to fix the drive from a data retrieval agency.I decided to give this software a try, though I really did not expect anything from it.It worked. I recovered years of important work and I now realise how lucky I have been.I highly recommend this program but I can imagine that it may not work in all situations. It took a really long time to operate, about 2 days total but as you can imagine, was totally worth it. My only gripe, is that while running, the user interface feedback window is frustratingly minimal and you really have no idea what to expect. Whatever algorithm is used to calculate the estimated finishing time is a little shoddy, so don't rely on it, at all.It gets 5 stars for doing what it promised....minus 1 for hiding its thoughts from me."
2,No file names?,"Near useless to me. I work in video. Sure, it recovered about 500 clips, but without the names, it's impossible to tell which is which without manually going through them! What a pain. If it would retrieve the files with names, I would give this 5 stars."
1,poor quality,"This book looks as though it was printed made from an ink jet printer then duplicated on a copier and bound, about 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper. It is more like a college report format. I made the mistake of buying several different novels in this format. Needless to say, I have not bothered reading them and will probably toss them in the trash."
4,"Fun, but not as good as the arcade.","As with the previous Virtua Fighter console versions, this game provides realistic movements and much better control than button-smashers like Tekkon. The characters have a huge amount of attacks and defenses (only some of which are described in the booklet.) The 3D, varying-elevation backgrounds are nice, but not rendered as well as the arcade version. Downsides - the graphics are a bit choppy and the standard Dreamcast controller makes some multi-button and combination moves a bit awkward. You can program the controller through the options menu, but this is not something most experienced VF'ers want to do. All in all, very entertaining, realistic fighting."
4,The first Great Fighter!,"Virtua Fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as DOA2, or tekken tag, but believe me this was what paved the way for those games. All though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters, virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles (drunken style, mantis, sumo, etc.). I was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games. Even with new games on the market, I think i'll be playing this one for a while. The teacher of fighting games."
2,It might have been fun,"Granted I am well aware that people say you can't compare this with Soul Calibur. However you CAN compare this with DOA 2 therefore I can not really find any real reason to play this game.(I have played DOA 2 so I can say this.) It does have some neat specials, some realistic attacks and ok extra's. Also it has about no replay value so if you really want to play it you should go to the arcade. It really would have been good if it were to be released prior to Soul Calibur."
4,GOOD BUT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER...,"AFTER 3 YEARS SINCE IT'S ARCADE RELEASE, sega's flagship fighter has finally arrived via dreamcast. but however without any real extra goodies, the graphics may be dated, but still hold their own against the likes of power stone and maybe soul calibur...maybe...unfotunetly there's not enough charcaters in the VF3 line up. the sumo wrestler is very boring, but the other new fighter AOI, is great for VF experts. what improvements this game could've used would be a tekken like tag-team mode, where u could switch figters on the fly, as well as extra costumes and even a quest RPG mode like the original soulblade game (PSX) these extras would've definetly sell this game more, if not as much as SC oh well, just wait for the upcoming DEAD OR ALIVE 2 for DC. that's gonna be SEGA'S answer to tekken tag team.."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","Graphics are below average, action is slow. This game looks like it belongs on a Sega Saturn. Compared to offerings like Soul Calibur and Dead or Alive 2, this game is utter crap. Unless you are a fighting game nut you will not like this game."
4,The Depth of VF3tb,"Virtua Fighter team battle is one of the deepest fighting games I have ever played on any system. When I first played the game I was a little dissapointed. I thought that the characters would move quicker and their attacks would be flashy, but as I played the game more it became very interesting. There were many attacks, throws, blocks etc. that you can't pick up by just pressing any button at random, a person would have to study the game, and get the right timing on each attack, throw, and block. As a person gets deeper into the game he/she finds out that every character has, what seems like, an infinite amount of moves. For me it seems like I learn something new about a character every time I play and that's what makes this game one of the best and deepest fighting game of all time."
3,"Overrated, but still decent","I had heard all the hype about Virtua Fighter 3tb for the Dreamcast, and when I saw it for cheap I picked it up expecting a hell of a fighting game. What I got was a mixed bag, this game is nowhere as fun as people say and can't hold a candle to other fighting games like Soul Calibur and Dead or Alive 2 for the Dreamcast in terms of graphics, play modes, and playability. The graphics don't even look like Dreamcast graphics, they look like the game was developed on the Sega Saturn, but the cons end there. The gameplay is deep however, the fighting styles take a lot of time to master for each character, and after you do the game is a breeze. It's a decent fighting game, but nowhere as good as it is said to be. ..."
2,Dissatisfaction,I found the quality of the recording is poor. I am disappointed in it. Doesn't even sound like Judy Garland.
2,Great Band; Great Album!,"A truly wonderful blend of jazz fusion, rock, and a host of other influences. If this band had the national recognition, you would hear the name Jimmy Robinson mentioned with the likes of Clapton, Beck, Robertson and Page as one of the truly great guitar players. They are not afraid to try new things, and they produce a sound that is unique that makes you want to listen to the album again and again."
2,This is a flimsy tent,"The tent is smaller than advertised. I measures 10' from pole to pole on the top and 14' from pole to pole on the bottom. The opening is 5'2"" and requires an adult to bend to enter. However, you can stand once inside. This is not a good option for back yard entertaining. It is probably OK for camping in areas that are not windy.This is a very flimsy tent and will not survive moderate wind. Even when staked down with the tie downs strings, it has a tendency to twist or cork screw around the legs. There is no support to keep the tent from twisting around the legs. Recommend that this tent be staked and not allowed to stand on its on. I would not take it to the beach.The good side.The tent comes with nylon bags for the poles and a carrying case. It is light weight and sets up easy."

4,"Same, same, but different..","If you read ""Fast Food Nation"", you will like this book. There are similarities, but also many differences. The book refers to fish farm and gets into the economics of agricultural business. A great read."
5,Highly Recommend,"""Frantic Atlantic"" (from ep. 7), ""Swiss Missed"" (from ep. 4) and ""Going Uruguay"" (from ep. 11).This is the sixth and final volume in the series. A great way to end the videos with this tape. It's a tape definitely for die hard Disney and Lion King fans."
1,Run from Dazzle,"This is half-baked software at best. While the box seems to imply that you will be able to capture video at mpg2 on the fly, the result of this capture in most cases, cannot be burned to DVD without re-processing by the computer. I truly wish I had sprung for something else (like matrox). It is a shame you cannot list zero stars, in my opinion that is what this product is worth!"
3,Description,"""The Gunns never did bring the Keiths anything but sorrow,"" Theresa Keith acknowledged after she had left her home in New Zealand for Austria in the hope that fresh scenes and new faces would take her mind off Murdoch Gunn, the man she was to have married.But Murdoch, like all the Gunn clan, was ruthless and usually got what he wanted. Did he still want Theresa?"
5,great game,i rented this two days after i got my dreamcast it lot of fun and kind of pazzling tring to figering out to get to the next stage .
3,Coolest DC mascot but... Mario reigns!,"... having played platform games from Nintendo, Sega and Sony,I found Nintendo makes the best platform games. If you enjoyed Super Mario 64,Donkey Kong 64 and Banjo Kazooie... Sonic Adventure may let you down.If DC is the only machine you have then by all means get it - it is still the best platformer in DC"
4,Excellent buy for Sonic fans,"Sonic Adventure was the start of Sonic's 'Modern' appearence, its an excellent game, and the storyline will send shivers of joy down your back, it was also the first game to allow you to raise Chao!, its really cool, also try the sequel (sonic Adventure 2) its got an even better storyline and is the first appearence of Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the bat"
4,Sonic Great if you can get it to start,I really enjoyed the graphics and play in Sonic. I would really recommend it if I could get one that works. I have exchanged nine CD's so far and still haven't found one that starts when you turn the dreamcast system on. I have to power up and down many times before the dreamcast stops telling me to insert the CD. This is the only dreamcast game that I have that does this.
3,"It's good, but...","This is a good game. If you were an orginal fan of the""Sonic"" series, then get it. But, I must warn...before youbuy the game get a VMU (visual memory unit). If you don't have one you won't be able to save the game and every time you turn it off, and play later...you will have lost the game you were playing before. Now this means, you will have to sit through those annoying movie sequences over and over and over again. Don't make the same mistake I did, buy a VMU before you buy Sonic!"
3,"Good Game, VMU Needed","Sonic Adventure is a great game if you have a VMU. The game revolves around a VMU. If you do not have one, then you have to start the game all over again and you can not skip the story parts of the story. It is very time consuming if you do not have a VMU but if you do, the game is GREAT and so much fun."
4,"Sonic Good, Dumb Movies Bad","This game would have gotten a five from me, except for all the movies. I hate it when games have those stupid half hour movies interspersed throughout the game. I had a friend over once who wanted to play the game, and he couldn't play with a new character because the friggin intro was too long. He eventually got bored before he played. The movie thing happens all throughout the game, not just in the intro. It really breaks up the gameplay. I mean, when you've just beat the level, do you want to move on to the next level or watch some movie where the dialog isn't that good and you don't care about the story?"
2,"Beautiful transitions, disappointing gameplay","I got Sonic Adventure along with a Dreamcast for Christmas and I must say that I am disappointed. I was expecting a better-than-3D version of the old linear sonic, but instead, a got a video game that was so saturated with movies that I thought it was a DVD or something. This game has simply wonderful albeit lengthy sequences, but there are just too many of them. And to make matters worse the controller is hard to use. Buy with caution!"
4,Sonic Adventure,"This game is simply awesome. For one thing, you get to choose between 7 characters (the 7th is secret). As Sonic, you simply go through the level to the end. As Tails, you race another character to the finish. As Knuckles, you must search for emerald shards. As Amy, you run from a psycho robot, while leading a flicky to the safety of a hot air balloon. As E-102, you complete a task. And as Big, you... go fishing(groan!). This is the 2nd best Sonic game and number 6 on my favorite games list. It boasts incredible graphics, awesome gameplay, and the character voices are great. And if you dont have a dreamcast, its also for gamecube. If you have neither, get one of them, quick! So get this game. You wont regret it."
5,FANTASTIC!,"Sonic Adventure is a terrific display of the power of Sega's new Dreamcast system. Not only does it look good, the controls are easy to adapt to. The only bad thing is the camera angles, which sometimes make it hard to see Sonic or Sonic's surroundings.. But that is easily overcome since the game lets you control the camera with the L and R buttons and the D-Pad. If you're a beginner or even a veteran, Sonic Adventure is an excellent choice."
5,Sonic is the man! He does'nt play games!!!,I BEEN A SONIC FAN FOR MANY YEARS. AND NOW HE'S TO POWERFUL FOR ME. DON'T FORGET HE MAY BE FAST BUT YOU STILL CAN ...............
1,Don't Waste the Money,"What a waste. The graphics are excellent but the story is horrible, not to mention the boards. I am definitely not a devout gamer, my last system was a Genesis, and bought this game out of nostalgia for the old Sonic. Most boards require nothing more than moving Sonic ""forward"", others, like a pitiful Casino Land, require playing pinball with games with bad physics and all but impossible to lose (I had to just let Sonic fall between the flippers). Don't waste the money, buy NFL2k instead."
1,"Stick with the cartoons, not this computer-generated slop!","All the Sonic games I have played have all been the same disspointment over and over again. Then I played Sonic Adventure at a store that had a sample of it. I must say, the game is the worst I've ever played. The characters are pathetic! Sonic acts like an egotistical teenager, Amy acts like a screaming immature brat, Big is way too dumb and that E-102 robot is one of the cheapest robot characters I've ever seen. The only decent characters are Knuckles and Tails. The one thing that's really stupid is that you have to pick a certain character for a level.But hey, if you like Sega and the Sonic games, then get this! I must admit the graphics are good, but unlike the Sonic cartoons and comics, all the games' plots have been the same, cheap slop over and over again. I am a Sonic fan, but I like Knuckles, Tails, the comic books, and the cartoons.So, remember, Sonic cartoons and comics are a must-see, games: a must-miss! It's up to you."
2,It Stinks!,"For everyone who wants to play a boring kiddie game, I recommend Sonic Adventure! It is the worst game I have come across in all the Dreamcast games that are out. The plot is the same as all the other Sonic games (save Tails and beat Robotnik.) I beat it in 1 day. No cheats were used, and this was my first time playing Dreamcast. I think that this game stinks."
1,Nauseating,"This game is bad. First of all, you run around like a freak, and you barely feel like youre controlling the character. the game play is awkward and stupid. After playing the game for 10 minutes I thought I was going to throw up. Really, there are points where you can just put down the controller and make a phone call and it doesnt seem to matter.The game also lacks polish, as if they were in a hurry to get it out. Take a game like occarina of time. That is a great game, this game is for people who dont understand why and what makes a great video game"
5,This game is the bomb.,you should buy this game. It rocks. It has a chao minigame with the vmu. Its a game for all ages
3,Don't listen to the other reviewers! They're sonic addicted!,"Don't listen to the others! The game isn't good as you would think! for one thing, the game is very polygonal. It doesn't make dreamcast proud at all! The American voices seem to be not as good as the Japanese ones(my opinion). The cinematics are unskippable and can get annoying. The saves happen only at certain points in the games or a change in the option menu. If I were you, I'd rent it and play about 2-5 hours a day(I know that's a lot, but it's till not worth buying) and rent until you're done with the game. Though I must admit, the 7 character selection(yes, there's a 7th character) and the trial section are very nice, it'd be a waste to buy it. ... It's an OK game, buy it doesn't go with the Saga of Sonic very well."
3,Interesting game,"I found Sonic to be an overall O.K. game. Nice graphics, and it's easy to learn. I love the mini-games (snowboarding, dog-fighting etc.) but the game really shines in the way you can choose one of five charachters to play with. Nice variety. Don't expect me to be playing with my Chao's that much though. There might of been waaaaaay better ways to approach that idea."
4,"""Sonic Adventure"" is fun, but lacking puzzles.","""Sonic Adventure"" starts off easily, and it's easy to get the hang of. However, it may be a little too easy. There is a lack of puzzles, and the bosses are pretty simple. I guess I'm the person that likes RPG's like Zelda and Grandia II. The story is ho-hum, but once you get into it, the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with. That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two. Also, the graphics and sound are good. My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English. (That is if you have the language set on English.) I'm not sure of this, but I AM sure that their oral movements definately aren't matching what they say. Overall, it's worth the price."
3,"A good game, but quickly exhausted.","My fave parts of this game are the graphics, levels, (speed highway my favorite) voices, (except Big's) and characters. My fave characters are Sonic and Super sonic. It has some small glitches and camera problems. And it kinda goes stale after the 30th time. I have played it probably 85 + times. (over 200 probably with all the characters) It's the game that you can't help but love. Not the best launch game of the sega, but it's good. Let's see Sa2 and sonic shuffle please!A 15 year old gamer"
5,OH MY !,"This is a great game ! Its has faults which I'll cover because if I where to tell you every little thing that is great about this game, this review would be well over 10,000 words long. The first thing I don't like is the fact that is feals short. Yeah I know it does have 6 characters and some games are more fun than others. (my favs are Sonic, Amy and Knuckles) But they all feal short and almost just samples. Another thing I dislike in this game is the Runis level in Sonic's game! Just plain frustrating. WELL there you have it that is all that is wrong with this game! Oh and one other thing sometimes you'll be sooo busy just staring at the goddly graphics that you won't even play the game! GO NOW AND BUY!"
5,This game is a must buy!!!!!!!!,This game is one of the best games I've played in my life. I really enjoyed the perfect graphics and the speed of the game. I can't wait till I get my hands on this game. It's a must buy for everyone that gets a Dreamcast!
4,"Not Sonic's finest hour, but certainly his finest looking...","Sonic has arrived on the Dreamcast with the same blazing speed he brought several years ago to the Sega Genesis. Sure, this game's a bit different than the previous titles, with actual exploration and different characters being part of the action, but the basic action remains the same, with spin dashing and enemy bopping everywhere. The main fault I could find with Sonic Adventure was with the camera, which would twist and turn in some spots to the point of absolute annoyance. What good is trying to time a jump if you can't see your character? Overall, however, the levels are huge, the action is fun, and the depth this game offers will keep you busy for some time. You can even breed your own Chao, a Tamagotchi-ish pet, if you get bored. A great product for all ages, but, in the sequel, how about a more refined camera, huh?"
4,Motion Sickness,I love this game. It's loads of fun to play. The only serious complaint I have is the camera. The camera angles can often be horrible. Sometimes the view of the character is completely blocked by a wall or other object and it is impossible to swing the camera around for a clear picture. The way the camera pivots and rotates also left my stomach reeling. It gave me a headache and a good dose of motion sickness.
5,Fun for hours!,THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN. I LOVED PLAYING IT. WHEN I GOT IT I COULDN'T BEAT THE BOSSES. BUT I TRIED AND TRIED AND I BEAT THE WHOLE GAME I HAD FUN.
5,Sonic is back!,"It's a very good game, great Grapics, rating Grapics:9.5/10 Fun rating:8.5/10 Gameplay, how long it lasts, well about 15-20 hours to do everything, but im a advence player, a avarage person about 20-25 hours, So Gameplay:8.5/10 The sound is GREAT! I really like what Sonic Team did for the sound, sound rating:9.5/10 and Overall, I would say 9/10 and or me, 9 out of 10=awesome.Now the game is with 6 playable characters, Sonic:The main fast blue hengehog, Tails:The two tailed fast, and flying fox, Knuckles:The echina, he glides and he is red, very cool, Amy:Sonic's pink ""Girlfriend"" Big:A purple big cat that fishs to get fish, and a red robot, EOC=2. Sorry if I got the robot's name wrong, I haven't played it in a while. One thing I have say if you don't have it ""GET IT""!"
4,GREAT GAME BUT HAS PROBLEMS,"Sonic Adventure is a great game but has some problems.The problems are: 1.There are some camera glitches. 2.The storys(previews) in the game could use magor editing. 3.You can't skip through them if you wanted to. Besides that, this game is very fun. It kept me busy for a few months."
4,Great Sonic game!,"This has got to be one of the better Sonic games out their, if not the best! This game would appeal to anyone, no matter how old or young, it's just fun! The only complaints I have are the annoying camera angles, (can you say... cheap death!), also some of the characters are just plain dumb! (ex. BIG the CAT), and also the voice acting needs MAJOR work! Just put it in Japanese with the English subtitles and enjoy the ride!"
5,None will read this but I feel it is my duty,"The dreamcast is dead, no more consoles from sega, great games lost? Not neccasirly you can get them on the gamecube too. However I was hear to write a review.This game is fast action, and exploration, and questing. There are missions you have to unlock and sub missions you must complete plus you can switch between characters. And each characters levels differ, like tails racing sonic or knuckles finding shards, this was quite possibly the best platformer ever made. It puts mario to shame and I hope the known world undesrtands this!"
4,"great , with a slight freezeup",Looping action adventure fields you can get lost in ugly chao that die when you acidently hurt them and a small black out around emarald coast somtimes
5,Sonic Adventure is an excellent game!,"Sonic Adventure is an excellent game, with enough challenge in some areas, (such as Sonic's ""Lost World"" Level!) to keep hardcore gamers going, but it's simple enough in other areas for beginners to enjoy it too. A great plot, almost as good as reading a good book, and plenty of animated sequences. A little bit of puzzle solving involved in the Adventure fields, as well. This is a 5 star entertaining game. I gave it a 3 in durability because it's a GD-ROM (Game Disc - Read Only Memory) and they are rather fragile, and 3 stars in educational value, because it doesn't teach very much, except maybe problem solving skills. Overall, this is a great game."
3,Sonic is Okay...,"Sonic Adventure is a pretty good game. I came into this one expecting a game like the old Sonic games. It is nothing like that. It really is a full-blown adventure! Personally, I was looking forward to more side scrolling action. Navigating the 3-D can get a bit tedious at times. If you have no problems with that, then this game is for you!"
3,Great Graphics But.........,First off I did like it at first because it had excellent graphics. But after 10 minutes I became stuck. So I don't really recomend it. But if you really want it buy it.
2,Dissapointing!,"This is not a Sonic game. I am not an anti-Sega fanatic for saying this - the fact is, I have been loving Sega games since I first started playing video game... ""Sonic"" in the title is right but the ""Adventure"" part of this game ruins the whole thing. This is what happen when graphics is more concentrated upon by a video game team rather than gameplay. Sonic Adventure is a Mario 64 with speed since it doesn't try to be original in its story-telling and game design. Stick with Sega Saturn's ""Nights"", which is more beautifully executed. This game reminds me a lot of Treasure's ""Mischief Makers"" - great idea, poor execution."
3,A good way to spend an afternoon,"This is the one game that, by now, every Dreamcast owner already has. And deservedly so; it's easy to pick up and it's blindingly fast. Problem is, it's so fast, you'll blow right through it in a few hours. It's too bad Sega felt the need to tack on the other characters. All the non-Sonic levels are boring (especially the big cat levels where you fish). Then there's the terrible music. I recommend muting your TV and playing your own music on a CD player because the in-game music just doesn't work at all. Or you could listen to it for a good laugh."
3,A poor choice for beginning Dreamcast players...,The latest game from Sonic boast some intense game playing but lacks in many key areas. During areas where the story is being told you have no option to skip it and are forced to endure countless boring minutes of characters speaking. At times it's not clear where one is supposed to go. This is possibly because this game is starting to take on a more role playing game stance as opposed to staight forward game playing.
3,"graphics and gameplay, but lack of difficulty makes mediocre","Even though Sonic Adventure has great graphics and gameplay, the poor camera work and lack of difficulty make it only mediocre. It took me two days to beat the game with Sonic, and only 45 minutes to beat it with everybody else. Also, the bark was much larger than the bite of all of the bosses, including ""Perfect Chaos."" It took me two tries to beat the final and ""strongest"" leader. For a game that represents a company, Sonic Adventure is a big under achiever left with much potential. My advice, Rent it instead of buying it. You can probably beat it in the three days that you have it."
2,not to happy,"i dont like it at all. dont like the controles, dont like button placement. and dont like headphone jack placement at all. junk if you ask me."
2,Stupid design,"Great price for the capacity, but the design is stupid inside and out. You can put files in separate folders but the player will just play everything in alphabetical order anyway. If you turn it off in the middle of a file, it starts back up at the beginning. Really annoying if you are listening to a 1 hr podcast. The fast forward is slow and steady, so it takes forever to get back to where you were in a long file. It uses 6 buttons - easy to accidentally press buttons - to do what a Creative Zen Nano did with 2. Finally, putting the battery on the back makes the USB connection a pain - you have to clear space around it."
2,Pearl 2 GB,"The device only had 1 GB of working memory rather than the 2 it was supposed to have. I emailed RCA tech support (there is no number available to call). I received an automated reply that they would get back to me in 24 hours. 5 days later they still had not replied, so I sent it back to Amazon. Amazon was very customer friendly about it."
5,"Good book with a variety of activities, great DISCUSSION topics","I like this books variety of high energy or low energy activities. The authors do a better job then most books at processing the activities with the participants, and thus building a team spirit. Some of the activities require some complex props, besides those, most are easy to implement. I have used the activities with 9 year olds and up. I have bought copies to give to other group leaders for summer camps, bible camps and school groups."
4,Great ideas and easy to adapt!,I ordered this book just a few weeks ago and have already used many of the activities! They are very easy to follow and adapt according to your audience or the environment you are working in! Exactly what I was hoping for!
5,Pokemon Starter Gift Box,I bought this for my eight year old daughter and we have had many hours of fun playing together. It is definately a good math skill builder. On the back of the mat is a deck construction guide for adding in all those booster packs we work so hard to get. I would recommend this product.
5,Great price,One of the lowest price is at amazon for this starter gift pack. Good start for your collection.
3,Older kids will enjoy Magic more,"Pokemon is a hit. And chances are your kid aged 8 to 13 will love this game. But, if your child is older, say 14-18, do them a favor and get Wizards of the Coast's other hit game Magic: The Gathering. It's far more interesting and stratigic. If Magic is Risk, then Pokemon would be Tic-Tac-Toe."
4,"HEY, they might not have a 3-d look but...","At first I looked at the POKEMON game. It didn't look like the best graphics. I thought the whole thing was stupid at first, but then I caught on. It was REALLY fun. When you first start out you think, this is boring. Or am I playing it right. You have to learn. Soon you get the hang of it and start getting more, and better cards. Soon you're haveing a BLAST!"
5,The Gift Box is a great way to start on the Pokémon TCG,"I got this for my 12-year-old brother. He was so surprised! We played for hours! Originally only I had the Pokémon TCG, but now we could play together! On the negative side, it's not very durable if you have two cats. Don't leave this toy out if you have pets. This game teaches strategy, something most people can't get by in the real world without. I reccomend this over the starter set because it INCLUDES the starter set along with a Jungle theme deck, Jungle booster, playmat, and coin. The playmat helps build strategy while the coin is used during play. I reccomend this to parents with kids ages 5-15 who are interested in Pokémon."
5,Throw out the sleeping pills,"""Words can't express how great I feel! I was in an auto accident in 2000. I had cervical spine surgery with metal plating. I couldn't sleep with the pain and depression. I had three different kinds of sleeping pills. I used the Zzone and the first night I fell asleep with no help from the drugs!"" Franklin Deardorff, Gettysburg, PA"
3,kona comforter,"The comforter itself is fine, however, the color is much darker than shown in the picture, we kept it anyway but are disappointed by the color."
4,Very comfortable,"Comfortable from the first wearing. They are lightweight - great for easy summer days, but not so great in support or holding up to prolonged walking. The sole just didn't hold up to my first time of day long walking. At the right price, they're a great shoe for kicking around in."
5,Comfy!!,I love these shoes!! They are extremely comfortable from the start and don't require the normal break-in period.
5,Love my Skechers,The sneakers arrived in a timely manner and the price I paid was way below the price for these sneakers.
4,The Complete Worship Leader,I bought this as a fairly new worship leader and it provided several details and information that was needed as I began the journey.
5,The title says it all!,"As a professional worship director, a seminary student and a student of worship, I have read any number of books on the topic of worship. Kevin Navarro's book ranks, without question, as one of the best.""Complete"" is the right word to use in reference to this book. Kevin manages to squeeze a wealth of information into a relatively short, easy and engaging read. The chapters on musical direction alone can be used as a handy reference book, invaluable to have available in a church staff office. The sections on theology, discipleship and leadership are equally spot-on; Kevin readily points out the elements which are truly needed in today's church environment. Best of all, Kevin's heart for worship is evident throughout.I would highly recommend this book, not just to professional worship directors, but to anyone who accepts the challenge of leading a congregation into the presence of the living God."
5,"Practical, biblical advise","Kevin Navarro draws on personal experience and a solid biblical foundation to create this truly complete guide for anyone interested in becoming a worship leader of excellence. His writing style is never high handed yet it is impossible to read this book without being thoroughly aware of the fact that this is the work of a scholar. The only way to be successful as a worship leader is to put God first in all you do and this idea is wholeheartedly endorsed by the author, but God also expects you to use your talents in an excellent way. This is where this practical handbook really comes into it's own. Follow the principles and suggestions in this book and you will experience a new level of worship."
3,Is this product safe or not???????? Can someone please help..,"We put this glider on our registry, because we liked it so much in the store. And now after reading all of the reviews I do not know what to do. Is it possible that some of the reviews are for the old model? The last review said that this model was perfectly fine and safe, but the rest of the reviews are all very negative. Can someone please help me out!!! Are these negative reviews false?"
1,MUST RECALL!!!,"This chair is an absolute MUST RECALL!!! DON'T BUY THIS CHAIR - it can kill you and your baby! Risk of injury is nearly guaranteed. It is very poorly made and it will NOT last long. Yes, it does look nice and comfortable at the first sight but ""a nice look"" is all this chair has to offer. I will never forget when I was rocking my baby to sleep when she was 9 months old and then all of a sudden the back of this chair broke and it fell on us - it was SOOOO horrible.After reading numerous customer rewievs of this chair at babiesrus.com it became obvious that this hadn't just happened to us. Neither Babiesrus nor Jardin responded to my request for a full refund so far...They have been notified of a poor design of this product yet they keep selling it ""with a little different name"" - still! Isn't that sad, Dear Babiesrus, that you don't care for the safety of our children???????????????"
1,Dangerous Product,"This chair is poorly engineered. The back is anchored with two screws. Unexpectedly, the seat splits where the screws are attached. This happens suddenly and can cause injury. I suffered a back injury. Fortunately, an elderly person was not rocking the new born when this happened. Jardine acts as if they are unaware of this issue (which can't be true given the other reviews) and are making us jump through hoops to get a replacement chair."
1,This chair sucks!!,"After having my baby shower the one big item that i didn't get was a glider so I went down to the local Babies R Us and tried them out. I couldn't afford to spend $400 on a chair so originally I was going to go with a very cheap glider/ottoman combo. After several trips to the store and lots of deliberation I decided that i would forgo the ottomon and splurge a little on a better chair considering the amount of time I would be spending in it. This chair was priced in between the original one and the more expensive ones and in the store it felt soft and cushy. Well within a very short period of time the cushions became flat and unconfortable, they stained very easily and the incessant squeaking began. My son is now 6 months old and while it hasn't broken yet I wouldn't be suprised if it did. I am very dissapointed, If I had only know how uncomfortable I would be I either would have spent less to be that uncomfortable or I would have found some way to buy a more expensive chair."
5,"As always, Cuisinart delivers","I have purchased almost the entire Cuisinart classic line, and purchased this saucepan for my daughter. As the pieces come on sale, I add to her collection, and mine if I don't already own it.These products cook evenly and clean up the easiest of any cookware I have ever owned. Manufacturer instructions say you can put them in the dishwasher, but I prefer to wash them by hand which is a breeze. The exterior shine has stayed stellar in spite of repeatedly use and washings. I also own some pieces of a much more expensive stainless cookware set (ends with ""clad"").... and I find the Cuisinart to be as good in the cooking of food, and actually much better in the clean-up of the pot/pan.I highly recommend this product."
5,"Great Pan, Bad Shipping from Amazon","This pan is heavy yet awesome. I bought this pan, a 5 1/2 inch saute pan saucepan, a 4 qt saucepan, and the 12 inch everything pan. I bought all four on one order but all arrived in different boxes, in different conditions and from different shipping companies. The 5-1/2 qt saute pan was shipped via FedEx in the Cuisinart box with one end resealed with a piece of cardboard and lots of tape - the helper handle of the pan was the tiniest bit scratched. The saucepans were put in an amazon box and shipped via UPS perfectly. The Everything pan was shipped via a weirldy named shipping company that FedEx uses and was fine. 5 stars on the pans, but 1 1/2 stars for Amazon. This is the first time of the hundreds of items and times that I have used Amazon that I was not very happy with the way things were shipped."
2,It's very lightweight,"Not the heavy duty pot I was hoping for. It's very light, and the inside seems to get stained too easily."
5,Love these saucepans!,"I bought the 1.5 and 3 quart of this set so I needed the 2 quart to complete it. Looks very professional, easy to clean, heavy duty, and lids fit nice!"
3,4 qt saucepan,"Although very well built of quality materials, the shape of the handle left a lot to be desired. It was so narrow that it felt as if I had little ""control"" of the pan once in my hand.And I found that I prefer my saucepan having a 4 1/2 qt capacity instead of just 4 qts."
2,fine pan with 1 terrible flaw...,"So this pan is fine. The heat conducts evenly. I'm able to get a very low heat all the way up to a pretty blazing hot.But the handle is too heavy. When empty and resting on my standard-issue gas range, the pot tips back! It's terrible. As if life isn't hectic enough, now you have to set the pan directly in the middle of the burner.You get what you pay for. For ~ $20, it's a fine pan."
5,Excellent quality,I think this is very good quality and well worth the price. It is perfect for my needs and I expect it to last a good long while.
5,Love them!,"I am switching all of my aluminum cookware for stainless steel and am completely pleased with these little wonders. I ordered two of them and wish I had gotten three! They are easy to use, easy to clean, and perform like a charm. Because of the aluminum plate in the base (the aluminum core is encapsulated in steel, but the description makes it sound like it's the other way around -- trust me, there is nothing but stainless steel on the outside of these pans).Remember to use medium heat with all stainless steel cookware. Even so, these little charmers heat up nicely and reasonably quickly, and the health benefits make it worth the wait. I really like the shiny finish inside and out."
4,Utilitarian,"We ordered this 1 quart saucepan to compliment the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel set, which does not offer a 1 quart saucepan. While this little saucepan is handy for warming up small items, it does not compare with the MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel set.If you are in the market for a new cookware set, we highly recommend the following. Great price from Amazon.com and worth the extra bucks. We love our set.Cuisinart MCP-12 MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set"
5,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless Cookware,This is one of the best cookware products I have ever used ... the flavor of your food is just that ... the food's flavor with whatever seasoning you have elected to use ... and clean-up is easy ...I would recommend this product to any one ...Rodney P. Hanagriff
4,Beware of saucepan rim,"This is excellent cookware, but please be careful when washing by hand because the rim is very very sharp and may cut you."
2,Worth the price u pay but...,I bought this Cuisinart thinking i got an amazing deal on one of the best brand in kitchenware.. the pan arrived in a perfect shape shining in all its glory. i used it as per instructions to boil milk and eggs or make tea. very lightly used. didnt put it in dishwasher as well. what i noticed one fine day was some spots on the bottom. they look like rust but the surface is fine.the spots make it look like its a very cheap material and i m concerned on its safety for cooking.. wont buy cuisinart cookware. have lots of kitchen electrics from the company and i think that its only average or slightly below that..
2,Spots after first use,"When cleaning after the first use, I saw a couple of black spots on the bottom interior surface. It feels smooth to the touch, so I don't think they are pits. At the time of this writing, I have another Cuisinart pan on order. As I began looking through reviews on other Cuisinart products, I noticed a pattern of similar problems. I will not purchase any more Cuisinart products if this occurs on the next purchase."
3,"Not the heavy, solid quality of the MultiClad Pro line!","I was concerned about the great price (rather low cost) for this 4-quart pot. The quality and weight is not NEARLY like the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro line, although for the price is fine. ADDITIONALLY, a pot this size could use a ""helper handle."" I wanted a 4-quart pot, purchasing first, the 3-quart American Kitchen (Regal Ware product). I had to ""settle"" for the Cuisinart Classic brand for the 4-quart size."
3,Quality reduced in 2010 version,"I just bought this 3 qt. pot (12/2010) to replace the same Cuisinart pot that I damaged. The original pot was purchased about 1.5 to 2 years ago and a side-by-side comparison shows that Cuisinart has been cutting corners on materials to make more profit. The newer version has a much slimmer base on the bottom of the pot, close to 1/4"" slimmer, so apparently there is less aluminum and possibly also thinner stainless steel sheathing. The handle rivets have been scaled down and the ""Y"" shape connection of the handle to the pot has been slimmed down. Overall the pot weighs in significantly lighter than the original from 2008. Time will tell regarding durability, but not the same sturdy quality of previous editions."
3,Temperamental,"I dare not saute vegetables in this pan to start a soup or stew lest they burn. So I have to use a skillet to saute the vegetables: two pots instead of one.I follow the cleaning instructions. I have to soak it in hot soapy water, let it cool to lukewarm, and wipe it with a soft cloth (not even a Dobie pad)to *try* to remove any stuck-on food. Rather a long process.After the first time using and cleaning this pan, it looked ten years old. Although it was clean, the bottom had a dull coating that could not be removed by using vinegar.It cooks food effectively, but it is no fun to use."
1,Very dissapointed,"I bought this pan 2days ago, it looks very nice just like on the photo but the quality is awful , i put A water and a little salt to boil and it got rust stains all over the buttom from the inside and a water circle all around the pan, i tried to wash it but no help, dont buy it, its a cheap quality product and does not worth the money at all.i have a berghoff pans which has a excellant quality, better to pay a little bit more but have a pan that we will use but not this rust one."
2,Disappointed,Handle way too small. Metal in pan soft. Scratches very easy.Top very cheap. Not a good value.Would not purchase Cuisinart cookware again...
5,Cusinart 4 QT stainless saucepan..,Excellent tool. Food sticking not the problem I thought it might be. Exterior is almost scarey bright.Thanks very much. rkw
2,"Good info, not well presented (...)","This book was originally issued in England under the title Bass Culture and putting it out here with a name change, cover change and no reference to the original is pretty deceptive, IMHO. That having been said, I had mixed thoughts about this book. The part of the book that covers the 1950s through the middle 1960s is wonderful, with lots of detail that hasn't been available anywhere else and it leans heavily on the reminiscences of Prince Buster who is a very valuable resource. By the time Bradley gets into the 70s, he loses his exclusive source (Buster) and the narrative speeds up. The 80s and 90s are dismissed quickly and very incompletely, making this a strong source on early Jamaican music but pretty useless on everything else. One further note - (...)difficult sentence and paragraph constructions, bad grammar and bizarre word choices can make things very difficult to read."
5,One of the best books on the history of a genre written.,This is one of the most informative books on the history of a musical genre I've ever read. Doubling as a superb history of Jamaica made it even more readable and gave you a real feeling of not just where the music came from but also why it sounded like it did. My background isn't in reggae and this book gave me a good grounding as well as turning me on to some great music. I not only got a copy for myself but having read it I bought copies for a couple of mates who also thought it was a great read.
3,"No é genial, mas vale ler","Terrível a mudana de capa e de título. Como ""Bass Culure"" tem o mesmo texto comprei essa verso americana mesmo. O livro é escrito em ingls britnico informal, o que torna bem difícil de ler.No se trata de um livro sobre reggae apenas, mas sobre a ""história social da música jamaicana"". No é um livro didático que te ensina o que ouvir, quem fez, etc... Vc vai aproveitar bem mais se conhece Reggae bem e está querendo se aprofundar na ""cultura"". Acho que a parte sobre a música em si no é to boa quanto o lado do povo jamaicano, etc...Valeu a pena ler, mas no era o que estava procurando."
3,Love the rocker but it broke after 1 year,"My husband and I loved the rocker - we had our first son in November 2003 and are expecting our second in May and found the roominess great and the fabric very easy to clean. This month, the screws on the back of the glider 'stripped' and came out (and we couldn't fix it). You can no longer sit in the chair nevermind rock. I am going to try to contact 'Jardine Enterprises' to see if they have a warranty longer than 1 year - I would hope that they would back the quality of the chair to last more than 1 year. We will see. If not, I will most likely buy another glider to match the existing ottomon."
1,horrible!,i am not heavy and neither is my husband. this chair broke completely just after a couple of months!! we fixed it and it broke again!! i ended up frustrated and threw it out in broken pieces in the garbage!! please don't waste your money. i prefer to pay a little more and not have wasted my money!!
1,IT BROKE AFTER 2 MONTHS USE,"I got this chair as a baby shower gift. I didn't set it up for several months, because we were moving shortly after the baby was born. So I set it up and two months later it broke! I was gently rocking my baby to sleep. It was pretty late at night, and the back just broke off. Completly BROKE OFF! The wood had craked in half where the back was attatched to the base. I really didn't use this that much. I usually feed my Daughter in a different chair. So I use this possibly only once a day.I went back to Babies-R-Us, and they tried to say that I could not return it because I no longer had the box. The box was huge, where would I put it. I threw it away as soon as I took the glider out of it. I did finally talk to a manager and they issued me a store credit. So that is the only good thing about it."
2,forget the glider get a recliner!,"My mom bought us this glider in 2004 a 1 1/2 months before our first child was born. It was very nice great for breastfeeding all night and day. Until our daughter was about 3 months the screws holding the back let go and the arm broke. I fixed it with some new screws and bults and some glue for the arm. Now we are expecting our second child and the glider needed to be fixed a second time. We went and bought a rocking recliner that will be good for breasfeeding, lots of looking arround, but we got a nice one. I didn't want to take any chance of it braking again. Also it's not so comfy when you can feel how flimsy it is. The price of this chair was about $400 something 2 years ago. Personaly I would rather spend the money on something not made of wood, and have a great warenty."
1,Very dangerous! Ours broke too.,"DO NOT BUY THIS GLIDER!! My mother-in-law bought us this chair for Christmas, 2004.......it broke April 2005. It didn't even last 5 months! I really think the manufacturer should recall this chair. The back broke while my husband was rocking our 9 month old. Thankfully they weren't injured. The screws holding the back into the base would not screw back in and the wood split. Very dangerous chair. We were able to take it back to the store and get a store credit. Now we are struggling w/what glider to replace it with. But I will not buy another Jardine product again."
3,glider rocker,"I thought this would be a great chair, but after sitting in it for a few days, I was not comfortable. The back of the chair sits upright too much for my taste and although fairly comfortable cushions, it was too stiff and confinded feeling for me. I returned it. For the price, a little too expensive for this chair. I wouldn't use it has your primary rocking chair. The glide of it was nice though. I dont recommend square sides. The rounded ones are much better. It feels like you have more room."
4,Like this glider & ottoman,"Have had this glider for about 6 months now and like it very much. There are definitely nicer ones out there and I do kind of wish that we spent the extra money to get a nicer one but this one is getting the job done. Very easy to assemble and it has not broken like the others have said. It does sqeak a lot though and we have had to grease it a few times...no big deal though. The seat cushion was ripped when we received it but the company was great and sent a new one out right away. Not the most luxurious but like I said, it gets the job done and is not very expensive."
3,Broke after 6 months,"My husband and I really liked this chair and got lots of use out of it. After 6 months of use the screws stripped and it was unfixable. My husband tries to put more screws in to fix it, but it didn't work. After knowing my problem and reading other reviews I would not recommend purchasing this glider. I did contact the manufacturer and they are giving me store credit."
1,"Awful, simple as that.","Gosh.... Lynch managed to make all the Dokken songs sound much, much worst than the originals. Indeed, a fantastic feat. The excellent ""Kiss Of Death"" became an atrocious dog of a song, it's almost unbeliavable.The singer is also extremely annoying.One of the worst Lynch related releases ever."
1,Why?,"I'm a sucker for following artists when they leave the project that made them famous - I'll admit it. In the case of Dokken, I always erred on the Lynch side - the music, the tone, the RIFFS were always more important than the vocals, so I followed Mr Scary more closely.What a complete shocker this album is. It's really horrid. I can foresee that someone buying it without preconceptions or knowing the songs might find something here. Unfortunately, the majority of buyers will find themselves staring in disbeleif at the aural assault the disc represents.If you've never heard Lynch play a note, it might be okay. If you know his work - run as far as the Lynch / Pilson project release."
1,"Lost fire, growing older","Don't waste your money, this is crap !!! Talk about a huge let down.there are only 2 decent versions here: ""Relax' and ""Paris is burning""I've been a Gearge Lynch fan since the 80's and this is a sad progression. ""Smoke this' was also a huge mistake. George has lost the fire with his playing and his solo's have lost their passion, tech expertise and originality.Wickedly dissapointed, I was so fired up when I saw this CD in the store, I wish i could get my money back."
1,SHREDDING INDEED...BUT NOT ON GUITAR,"This sucks and takes the title of the absolute worst disappointment I've ever experienced in buying a new album by one of my favorite artists! I've always questioned alot of George's decisions since the end of Dokken, mainly the ""Smoke This"" album, which was just terrible. Now he's gone and destroyed and ripped to shreds some of the best songs in his career, it is just unbelieveable. Why do certain musicians feel they should try to revamp old material? Don't they know by now that nothing beats the original version. I was skeptical about this album at first from that fact alone, but I decided to give it a shot anyway, boy was I in for a nightmare! I won't knock George too hard because his other new release ""Lynch/Pilson"" is quite impressive, which is good because this attempt at re-recording old songs is an absolute failure and he should be put in jail for it. I hope Don Dokken isn't too upset with ole George, but I'm sure he must be, I don't blame him!"
5,"Liked George Lynch with Docken, Revolution a Must have","Fantastic CD. Being a Docken fan in the 80's, really loved their songs and most of all George Lynch's killer riffs. The weak point was always Don Docken's average voice. Now picture this, you hire a killer vocalist, then re-record the original Docken tracks making them extra heavy and relevant to todays sound, and you get Revolution. Just to hear the new remake of Breaking the Chains was worth the price of the CD. Loved it!"
4,dokken fans vs. nu metal,"first of all dokken rules! second, NuMetal sux! this album ROCKS! so what it doesn't sound exactly like the originals... its not supposed to. george still shreds, the songs sound good. most of all george is playing his custom baritone guitar and it has that awesome bass crunch to it. yeah the album may be a little under produced and rough cut, but at least it is better than that stupid NuMetallica KRAP. i still love dokken, and i think this is a good updated move for george and the crew."
1,Destroying What You Helped To Build,"With this new disc George Lynch is obviously trying to distance himself from his past with Dokken.However,in his attempt to be modern,cool and hip,George has managed to tear down the awesome originals that he helped to build.Why change the tempo on ""Kiss of Death""--C'mon.""Breaking the Chains"" i don't even recognize.Lynch has always sounded most excellent with his guitar tuned standard,not tuned down this low.Dokken were always better than the bulk of 80's metal/hard rock bands.It is just frustrating to see that the original version of Dokken cannot work together and reunite for a real metal record.George,Don,Mick and Jeff had something special as a band.This ""Revolution"" disc unfortunately falls very short of that great standard.Yes,its called destroying what you helped to build George------in essence Butchering Yourself !!!"
3,Fantasy (for) Life,"This is DEFINITELY one of the best. I haven't read much of it, but it makes me hornier than a freshman on Viagra! Fantasy work, in my opinion, beats out ""real life"" stuff every damn time, and this will just blow it right out of the water. Hot, sexy stories with functional, unobstructive plots, and a whole lotta the GOOD stuff! This book is what I was looking for and more. My member and I are enjoying it IMMENSELY!"
2,Boring and Predictable,"This is a boring book, some of the stories are SO unrealistic, only a 50-something year old could read them...It seems the author is heavily into rimming, which I find repulsive.I prefer a collection of real life stories rather than this ...."
5,"Good, but Scary","This book is very well written and the author carefully builds a strong case for his arguments. One would have trouble trying to defend Rick Warren after reading this book. I believe that every Christian should read it to help open their eyes to the subtle deception of the New Age, and because Warren is a dangerous false prophet. This author, like the Apostle Paul, boldly calls out these wolves in sheep's clothing."
5,I highly recommend this book!,This book is very informative and a much needed message for this day and time. Every concerned Christian who is interested in knowing what is really going on in the American church today should read this.
5,Liked the service,"I'm so pleased with the service of Amazon in hooking us up with the books of our choice. ""Deceived on Purpose"" was very interesting and thought provoking."
1,This author is clearly jealous. The claims are nonsense.,"This book is such a stretch and ironically a deception in itself. The points made have no substance and are erroneous in conclusions. I don't know what is driving these ideas, other than jealousy, riding the coat tails of a popular book by (failingly) trying to undermine it. Or just hate? Sad."
3,"It's OK.. borrow someone's, 'cause it's not a keeper","I liked the book when I got it in 1993, but only because it was the only book out there. One thing about it that I didn't like was how a lot was demonstrated only from the ""southpaw"" stance. You can't learn Muay Thai from this book, but check it out if you don't know anything about Muay Thai, and then forget about it once you step into a gym to train."
2,If you must.....,"Since this is practically the only book on Muay Thai and since you're already looking at it, you're probably gonna buy it. But if you value your money, then don't DO IT! If you know what Muay Thai is then you've already seen all the information in this book."
4,Good introduction,"This book is short and deceptively simple. It contains a lot of information for its size, and the descriptions are well illustrated by the photos. The author obviously has a true respect for the sport."
4,Excellent book for beginners,"This book describes all the basic techniques in detail, but tapers off when explaining advanced techniques like jumping round kicks and knees. It has VERY concise explanations of the front kick (foot jab) and round kick. The elbow sections are dated, but informative. This book is from 1987, and most of the material has not been updated on the ""westernization"" of Thai boxing. Jab, Cross, Hook is NOT covered. The author has the habit of writing an introductory paragraph on a technique, a few lines on execution, and then a piece on fighting application. Most of the sections really should be expanded. This book has excellent pictures and background information. The summary of the training routine is excellent. You could easily set up a program with a partner using this book. Overall, taking into account the shortage of material on Muay Thai, I would recommend this book to the beginner. Don't fool yourself, though. You MUST have an instructor to learn Muay Thai!"
3,I'ts a coffetable book.,If you know nothing about Muay Thai you might consider it. but it should not be seen in any way as a book to learn from. I believe Zoran Rebac is proably a very skilled martial artist. Who simply did not pay enough attention to his audience. over half the book is technique but there isn't enought detail to learn from. It doesn't cover the Muay Thai scene so who is the book written to? some of the pictures are southpaw but I liked that since I am a southpaw. the three biggest point's I can make are: less than 20 pages on training techniques. (If you are going to work with an instructor theres only a 3 page primer on the hisory of muay thai so what's the point) That it reads like a tour of Muay Thai. To sum up it should be in elemetary school libaries(?) so that little Kids can read about the exotic sport of muay thai (it's not like theres a lot out there on it.) get excited about it and then go out and find info about it.
3,"Accurate, factual, humble, dated","The author Zoran Rebac is level-headed and appears immune to the hype and BS often associated with martial arts. He accurately states that muay thai is a hard-nosed ring sport descended from more brutal fighting methods. Rebac is from eastern Europe. This book is a translation, so the writing is fairly concrete; if there were more nuances they were lost in translation. Rebac put in his time; he trained in the camps, did his roadwork and took his knocks. Rebac trained in SE Asia in the early 1980's, so this book predates the rise of Thai Boxing in the US and the aerobo-""kickboxing"" fad."
4,good look,"this book is a nice book to expose yourself to the art of Muay Thai.given the limited amount of material published on the subject in english this book makes a great addition to any martial arts library.the techniques involved are pretty basic.if you are interested in a little more on technique and at least equal quality as a martial arts book,try muay thai by Hardy Stockman,published by Ohara Publications."
3,anna Nicole,"was a very much soft porn version but she was a very beutiful woman who ended tragicly, you see what you see in a magazine of her"
5,Loved it - especially the mini documentary,"I've enjoyed Jamiroquai's music for years, but never got a chance to see them in concert. Though it took me a while, I got my hands on this DVD and I absolutely adore it! Watching it made me dust off ""A Funk Odyssey"" - a CD I didn't like upon first hearing. However, the concert made me appreciate the music on it alot. One cool thing about the DVD is the multi-angle feature enabling you to view the concert from different vantage points. There's also a little documentary (mainly a camera following Jay Kay around) and that was a nice addition. I'm glad I found the DVD - a definite MUST for Jamiroquai fans."
4,Great Movies!,"These movies are great. I figured i'd update my dvd collection to blu-ray. It comes with a lot of stuff too like a beanie hat with the ninja turtles logo on it and a few other things. The only thing that I am upset about with this edition is that there are no special features talking about the movies. I am sure everyone is saying that too but if you are someone who doesn't really care much for special features, and commentaries then this one is for you. But other than that it was great seeing these movies again."
3,NO EXTRAS NO MENU ON FIRST DISC,"The Blu ray set is great in quality, other than the fact that there are NO special features.and oddly enough, the first disc with the original TMNT 1990 movie on it, HAS NO MAIN MENU."
5,Movies great and comes with a ton of extras,"This is an amazing product. It comes with a beanie, picture stills, and an autographed picture. It is awesome and comes in a pizza box container. For any TNMT fans out there it is a must buy. I was surprised in how much I got with it on sell for 24 dollars."
5,I love this pack for TMNT!!!,"The box looks like a pizza box and the disc's print are pizza designed!You get a bunch of cool stuff with this package that is fun for any fan:1. Character cards!2. A winter hat!3. A signed artist's picture!4. A comic version of the first movie!5. Two great movies!a. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles- ***** Great comic book adaption movie!b. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2- ***1/2 Not as good as the first but still fun to watch!6. Two okay movies!a. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3- **1/2 Goofy, but fun!b. TMNT- **1/2 Had the right idea, but needs better battles!I would recommend this to any fan! Buy this set now!"
1,NOT AT ALL WHAT THE PICTURE IS...,"I thought this was the blu ray version since in the picture it shows blu ray, I also thought it was the 25th Anniversary movie as well, but NOPE COMPLETELY WRONG. My kids and I were super disappointed. The original turtles movies ARE AWESOME!! I recommend them for everyone. My kids ages 9, 6 and 4 LOVE THEM, and watch them at least once a day. COWABUNGA!!!"
3,Get it for $10 unless you're a wacky collector,You can buy all 3 Blu-ray's for $10 or pay this set for $150+ just for some fancy artwork. Waste of money avoid these thieves!Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles / Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze / Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Turtles in Time (Triple Feature) [Blu-ray]
3,A verbose tome that scratches the surface,"Compared to the online help, this book reviews favorably. But Revit is a deep program, and to really use Revit efficiently and fully takes more than an ""intermediate"" book will offer, which the Aubin text admits to being. I say the text is verbose because, for instance, it always refers to Revit as ""AutoDesk Revit Building"", which gets very tiring. The book introduces Revit by designing two projects, which is nice, but a lot of the useful information is hidden in little sidebar tips, which makes using the book as a reference (for instance, as a command reference) difficult."
2,Slow to learn,Needs simple illustrations not long descriptions.You can not quickly learnyou must go through long excercises instead of short descriptions with drawing.The problem is I have not seen anything different for Revit or Architectural Desktop.
1,Mastering Autodeak Revit Building,"When you do a search for Revit 8.0 this book comes up as a suggestion, but beware. It is only for 8.1 because the files only work in 8.1. That makes the book totally useless to Revit 8.0 users."
4,Good Transaction,"Good transaction, exactly what was advertised. No pain, just smooth deal. No hesitation"
5,A Great Product for Random Breakouts,"I don't really suffer from terrible acne, but every once in a while I need to hide the mountain forming on my face. This was given to me in a Burt's Bees gift basket, so I whipped it out and rubbed some on, not thinking that it would actually do anything. Lo and behold, the pimple had dried up the very next day, flattened out and clearly shrunk. It works consistently, and I actually like the smell."
3,Not for me.,"I purchased this product because of some of the really good reviews.I suffer from moderate/severe acne and I thought I would give this a try.The smell is very very very strong, and it stays with your for quite some time. This product did'nt do much for my skin. I used it for three weeks and I didn't notice much of a difference.Oh well, it may have worked for some people but it did not work for me."
1,Not effective at all...,"Sorry to give it only one star, but this product did not help me at all!!Smell is not pleasent(but I tolerated it hoping it would see some change), little greasy, and worst of all, the roll is painful to apply on red pimples!! And you really have to press and roll in up and down in order to get some liquid out of it.Would never buy this again!"
5,Wow!,"I bought this originally at Target on a spending spree for myself. I loved it. It greatly reduces pimples and fast! The only problem is my boyfriend loves it too, so we quickly run out. The smell isn't bad, especially if you are a normal user of burts bees products."
3,OMG THE STINK! THE STINK!!!,"Well, I've only just now used it for the first time and I seriously hope the smells worth it. If your don't mind black licorice smell then you'll probably do ok with it but, yuck!"
1,Absolutely No Effect,"This product was really disappointing. I've read rave reviews for it, so I thought I'd give it a try, but it did absolutely nothing for my skin. The smell didn't bother me. (The tea tree oil smell is very strong.) However, my six year old remarked, ""Mom! The awful smell of you!"" after I had just put it on. So it's not the most enchanting fragrance. Some people say it really burns when you put it on, but that only happened to me after I had used an astringent first. (So be warned... DO NOT use this product after using an astringent.) That was extremely painful. It might work for some, but it did absolutely nothing to clear my skin, so I really don't recommend it."
4,A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR,"THE COMPLETE TITLE OF THIS BOOK (STILL USED IN COLLEGES) IS:""MANAGING CONSTRUCTION, THE Contractual Viewpoint."" The type of contract used for a project largely determines how it has to be managed, yet many books on CM do not consider this fundamental fact in all its diversity; i.e., the variety of contracts used; from luemp-sum to cost-plus, with all the many variations on those themes. Contracts are boring to read, and oftgen left unread in their details--until something goes wrong! The Author (who has had decades of experience in several countries)."
2,Failed,"I thought this nut splitter, from the advertisement, would work better than the others I had tried. Not true. It failed as quickly as the others. I restore old trucks and sometimes have to resort to a splitter. Unlike the real old ones, the newer ones are made of cast steel not forged and quickly distort.Would not buy again"
2,Nut Splitter,"The Nut Splitter was Delviered on time, however the number 2 splitter in chamfered incorrectly causing the chiseled edge to be angled. Upon inspection i can see the product was not machined correctly. I guess TEKTON tools has no quality control inspectors, If they have them they must be the 3 blind mice."
1,Not what I expected,The principal of this tool is good but the design is not. It does not allow the cutter to go down to the surface to cut the nut. If the nut is on a loose bolt it may work. I should have returned it.
3,OK for the price - expected it to be more durable,"Tools are OK, and work on smaller nuts. The first time I used the larger tool, however, the bit broke. Disappointing."
1,Badly manufactured,"I've had 2 sets of these now, and the manufacturing quality is extremely low. The first set, the large one, couldn't even be turned - the threads were not straight. The second one, the large one, the thread was cast off to the side, so that some of the bolt was exposed, and not centered, meaning when you try and crank down the chisel, it goes off to the side. I'm returning the second set too, and will look for a different manufacturer."
2,don't waste your time with this nut splitter,"This may work for very light duty, but if you work on cars.....don't bother. I tried it once and the center punch just turns off to the side."
4,English Grammer for Students of French,A good little reference book for better understanding of French grammar. Oriented to English speaking students. Helps to better understand why some aspects of French language are challenging to translate directly into English.
2,What you see is not what you get.,"I ordered this license plate for my wife who is a big fan, although she is happy with what she got I am not, the image shown is a colorful detailed license plate of the Witch, Dorothy and her friends, plus the Emerald City in the background, I purchased this license plate to replace one that was damaged in a car accident so I know what the real product looks like, what I got was a plain license plate with BLACK writing NO DOROTHY AND FRIENDS, basically a green silhouette in the background for the city and a black silhouette for the witch, with zero detail, as I mentioned in the beginning my wife is happy so I guess that is all I should ask for, but if you are expecting the bright colorful detailed license plate in the picture don't be suprised if you don't get it."
5,A Baby of Her Own,"This book got me hooked on Brenda Novak and Dundee Idaho. Conner and Delaney's story is a nice premise the girl goes for a hook up for once in her life and regrets it right away, however she is already pregnant (as she wanted) but not independent as she wanted since Conner is now working near by. read a long and find out what happens....."
3,A Baby Of Her Own,"I really liked this book. Cute story and nice ending.Brenda Novak is a great writer. I,D like to know more about Rebecca and Josh.,"
3,Light Reading,"This was an okay read. It was quick and easy. However, I felt that the resolution came a little quickly, and I struggled a bit with the back story on the hero's mother and how he came to be. Because of the relationship with his uncles, that was clearly an important part of the story, but I felt like it wasn't really addressed except in a superficial way."
3,light reading,Easy reading with a slightly implausible storyline. I needed something to read during my commute that can be interrupted constantly.
4,A baby of Her Own,"I really had a good time reading ""a baby of her own "". It was enjoyable, but I did not like the ending. It fell short. I wanted to know more of what happened to everyone!"
3,A Baby of Her Own,An easy read and the story line was ok. Could have gone into more depth with the characters. Not sure if I would purchase other books by this author or not.
3,Sweet read,I enjoyed the plot but sometimes it dragged on and made the book a little tiresome to read. Otherwise I enjoyed it.
5,Great Story!,"I really enjoyed this story. It was feel good, and I liked how the characters grew over time and became better people. To be honest, the ending was a little abrupt, and I kind of wish that you could have seen how their relationship changed with the baby, but I'm sure that wouldn't have been very romantic so I give it a pass. Well worth the time it took to finish it!"
2,Bad and Cornry,"This story was just bad. The whole book the H/h fought and didn't get it right til the very end. The Heroine, very passive person (more like lets everyone run over her) wants to have a baby so her friend talks her into sleeping with a stranger to make it happen. Two hours from home in another small town they find Donor Dad and she sleeps with him, 3 weeks later she finds that it worked. A week or more she finds out Donor dad has moved to her town. And it's just downhill from there. The whole book they spend barely talking... him angry, her passive and than what do you know they are in love. This book needed a lot of help. I will not be reading the rest of the series. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is b/c I at least was able to get to the end of it. So happy it was free, but really sad I didn't spend my time reading something else. Brenda Novak's BULLETPROOF and LAST STAND series, say YES! Her romance? Just Don't!"
4,A Baby of Her Own,This was the first book I downloaded to my new kindle. I enjoyed it. It was a quick and easy read.
5,"Great story, Brenda Novak is awesome!",I've read what I thought were all of Brenda Novak's books. I was surprised to find I'd missed some older ones. The Dundee Idaho series is more than worth the read.
5,"Practical, very useful advise!","One of the most useful Bridge books I have ever read. Full of useful advise for common situations, both bidding and play. Lots of practical tips packed into small space. highly recommended"
5,A good antidote to road rage,"The songs are low-key, sometimes cheerful, sometimes pensive. Dominique is the closest that it comes to rollicking. It's good car music."
2,LOUD with or without the music!,"This toy was a disappointment for my 6yo. Although the picture here online doesn't show or mention it, another skater doll can go on the rink as well, but, she doesn't move and cannot be controlled. With or without the music, the machine itself is LOUD, almost sounding like a blender. I guess the disappointment could've been much worse; at least she'll play with it for a while, but the novelty normally wears off after 5 minutes of play. I'm glad I didn't waste my own money purchasing this one..."
3,What exactly IS this?,"NOTE: I haven't bought or seen this product. (I had to pick a star, or this wouldn't publish.)I love Marion Woodman and have read virtually everything she's ever written. But what exactly is this product? What is the format/content? Is this Marion Woodman telling her life story to an interviewer? How long does it run? Someone said ""graphics""... are their animations or something in the background. The product description is singularly uninformative-- amazon: how about beefing that up a bit?"
1,piece of junk,This phone is so terrible I would not take one for free if it was offered to me. Uniden should be ashamed of this product. If I could rate this less than one star I would.
4,Great Phone,"I have tried many brands of two line phones including At&t, & Lucent. All of them had poor reception and didn't last very long before the electronics began to malfunction. This phone was quick and easy to set up and offers great range and clarity. Most of all I like the two line caller id function. This is a must buy if you need a cordless two line phone with all the bells & whistles. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because you can not turn of the handset ringer."
3,It's Okay...,"This phone has all the features I require. Such as Caller ID, speakerphone, 2-line, cordless, etc. However, I'm not thrilled with the phone. It does what I need and the price is right so I'll probably keep it as I can't find many other phones with the same options [in the same price range].What I wish this phone had was a message waiting indicator. That would probably move it from a 3-star to a 4-star.As for clarity, I think it's extremely clear and has pretty good range.Besides the message-waiting indicator, my only other complaint is that I tend to also hang up inadvertantly on many calls. Must be the way the handset is designed. It's extremely frustrating. Also, as someone else mentioned, the 2-line feature is very confusing. I'm still trying to get used to it.I'm stuck between recommending and warning. I'd say if the amount of money you spend is more important that the ""little things"", go for it -- it truly is a decent phone.If only I could design my OWN phone."
4,Enjoying the phones,"I had ordered one for my husband a year ago because it had all the features he wanted. When I was in need of a new phone I read the reviews which were no longer favorable, but didn't have a problem with the phone set up and hanging up on people or the static when you are in close range of the base. Since I have ordered a second one for my home office - I have noticed static problems when I get to far from the base - but I know it's not a 900mhz phone and I didn't pay for that. The phone works great in my office and that's where I leave it - but I can walk around the upstairs of my home with it - no problems."
2,Not for induction stoves,"Very pretty and seemingly durable, but water placed in it did not boil on our induction stove. Be careful when buying stainless steel, seems to be the message. Make sure the label says it'll work!"
2,Poor Quality and poorer customer service,"I received this pot as a christmas present. It had what looked like a rust spot near the bottom. I had to pay to return it to Cuisinart. They took about a month to return one to me and the one they sent had a dent in it. Of course they were counting on my not returning it again. I kept the pot, used it one time to make soup and the inside bottom of the pot became horribly discolored. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. I have decided that life is too short to let go of my hard earned money to a company with poor quality products and even poorer quality control and customer service. In California, you can return such items to any place that sells Cuisinart. In any other state, you hae to return the product - at your expense - to the manufacturer. Why isn't the California law the same in all states?"
3,Weighs less than a 6 quart pot?,"I already have the Korean made 6 quart Cuisinart pot which weighs 4.78lbs while the Chinese made 8 quart weighs 4lbs. Both have an aluminum core bottom. The 8 quart pot works well but I thought since it's two quarts larger, it should weigh more! Otherwise the pot looks great, I think it will work well for me."
4,Very nice but takes forever to heat up,Only complaint is it takes quite a long time to heat up water with this pot. We have an 8 quart Cephalon which heats much quicker. But for the price its a good pot.
3,"Good pot when you're cooking, but not made the best.",I purchased this pot about 6 months ago and I've only used it about 5 times in that time making some soups or poaching chicken and works great for heat transfer and being more then roomy enough. But after only my 5th time using it the side of the pot cracked half the way down off one of the handle rivets. Stainless steel and the thing cracked in half from making soup?
4,It's workin' for me,"I've had this pot piled high with neck bones, filled with hocks and cabbage, stuffed with chicken and have made several batches of chili. It's workin' well for me.This pot is not commercial quality but I believe it will provide years of service for home use.If I experience problems with this pot, I'll make you aware."
4,A Solid Stock Pot,"This 6qt. stock pot, as it should be named, works well for it's purpose. For the price it is probably the best pot you will get. The stainless steel, as with all of cuisinarts chef's classic line, do show spots after cooking if your water is not soft, but is easily cleaned with bar keepers friend or equivilant. This is really only seen when cooking pasta. It holds temperature well, and when used properly, has very minimal sticking. By far one of the best and most successfull features on the entire line of pots and pans is the dripless rim. When pouring out sauce, water, or whatever you may be cooking, nothing gets dripped and then burned onto the sides of the exterior. Helps to keep your pots in good condition and clean. The lid also fits the 10 skillet so makes good for being universal. Would recommend this pot and the entire line of cuisinart cookware to anyone who wants good quality, and best of all affordable cookware."
1,"Now, I believe.",When I added this to my wish list I read many of the reviews and I didn't believe the ones that said it discolors when you wash it. I received this for a birthday and after the fist run through the dishwasher the lid had big splotches of rusty-looking discoloration that would not come off.I'm sad about the product being as bad as the negative reviews said. I have two other Cuisinart pots of similar grade and they have held up beautifully for years. I guess they just aren't making them like they used to.
3,This is not 18/10 stainless steel!,"I thought this is 18/10 stainless steel. But it's not!All the units under the chef's classic from the Cuisinart have the 18/10 mark on their bottom.But ths doesn't have it. I checked Macy's website. And it doesn't say this pot is 18/10.If I purchased it from Macy's, I would return it."
5,A superior pot for a fraction of the price of the competion.,"You can spend easily $200.00 and more for a pot this size, but why do that if you can buy this Cuisinart for less than one fifth of that. It has the same 18/10 stainless, the same bolted handles, the same tight fitting covers, but not the same price. The encapsulated aluminum disc bottom does the trick. Heat rises from the bottom of the pan to the top which means this type of pan will heat up just as fast and just as well as the competitors $200.00 pan will and at a fraction of the price. The Cuisinart was top rated in the leading consumer magazine just a short time ago and they take no ads and answer to no one.If you have money to waste, spend $200.00 or more on the leading competition's pot, but if you's rather not blow the extra $150.00 then buy the Cuisinart."
5,Love this cookware,"I purchased a full set of Cuisinart Chef's Classic cookware several years ago and love it so when I needed a larger stockpot I, of course, ordered this one. I make a lot of homemade soup and this stockpot is the perfect size. It works beautifully on my flat stovetop and looks great when it comes out of the dishwasher. I highly recommend this cookware!!!"
5,Perfect Size,This pot is exactly the size I needed to complete my set.I love CuisinartIt shipped quickly and arrived in one day.
4,Good value for the money.,"Even though I wanted the All-Clad pot, I went with this one instead because I am watching my pennies at this time. I do believe this was a great buy for the money. I recommend."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this for the size - six quarts - and the modest price. This is lighter weight than I was expecting and it seems to take overly long to bring water to a boil. I suspect the stainless aspect of it won't hold up well in the long haul. The first time I used it I brought water to a boil and then threw in a tablespoon of salt -- and immediately little black spots developed on the bottom of the pan. The black disappeared after washing the pan but little light color spots are still visible even after a good polishing with Bar Keepers Friend. I have a $260 dollar 8 quart All-Clad pot that I absolutely adore and this pot does not hold up well to that one in comparison. On the other hand, this puppy was just a fraction of the price of the All-Clad-- so I'd call it serviceable for the price."
4,"Solid, everyday workhorse",A good basic stockpot for any kitchen. Can handle frequent use and high heat from a professional stove. Good heat transfer and easy to clean.
1,Eaters Beware!,"When I got this pot I washed it as advised and proceded to make soup (using fresh, bottled spring water). After cooking on medium heat for one half hour, the water, potatoes and other veggies had all turned GRAY! I called Cuisinart and they claimed this was an 18/10 stainless steel pot (and should be stamped as such on the bottom), that had been made ""under a close eye"" in China. Well, the pot was NOT stamped as such on the bottom. They offered to analyze the metal for me if I paid for all the shipping. Sorry, Cuisinart, I'm not subsidizing YOUR quality control. I'm returning it for a refund -- at your expense."
1,Product Gets Rust Stains,"We are disappointed in this product. We purchased a few of these, and 2 of them, the 3 quart saucepan and this one, the 8 quart stockpot, both have gotten MULTIPLE SMALL CIRCULAR RUST STAINS all over the bottom of them (inside, where the food is cooked). I have tried to scrub these rust stains off, but they do not seem to respond to cleaning."
5,Great pot.,"I've only had this pot for a short time, but it's beautiful and large enough to accommodate large batches of soup, stock, curries, pasta sauce etc... Unlike many cheaper stockpots, this one feels very solid--not thin or flimsy--and the handles at the side of the pot make it easy to transport in spite of its large size."
4,I like this pot,"I like this pot which I use as a dutch oven. I use it frequently for soups and stews. My only wish is that it had a slightly heavier bottom. Not a lot heavier, just a bit more weight in the bottom."
5,One of my favorite pots!,"The 12 qt. is probably my favorite pot. Once is get hot it stays hot, even hours after the stove is turned off. I use an electric stove and it is outstanding. I've had this pot for 5 years and I'm attached to it.Can't go wrong with this one.I only wish it was induction capable, but it is not."
4,Excellent stockpot,"The Cuisinart 12 quart stockpot is a quality product. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son and daughter-in-law, who were very impressed with the quality and workmanship of the vessel. I would have given this product a 5 star rating if it came with a strainer basket, or even if one was available."
4,"I love, love, love these kettles but, boo hoo, the 12-quarter is warped","This is a great kettle -- I love it. It is attractive and sturdy and the perfect size, for example, for the lentil stew I cook and freeze for later use. The price is right too. I shopped for kettles before buying this kettle and the 12-quarter size and am delighted with the value and quality provided. Wooohooo! I love these kettles.It is now Jan. 6, 2013 and I am finally using the 12-quart size for the first time. Unfortunately, I have a glass top stove and the bottom of the kettle is warped so I need to return it. The 8-quarter kettle is great, however. I've never had a kettle before with a warped bottom so this is a surprise to me."
1,Not 18/10,I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this pot. My bad for not paying attention. It is not 18/10 stainless steel. No where on the box does it say 18/10. This would explain why others are having a problem with rust and other problems. I too encountered staining on the bottom the first time I used it.
4,Nice stock pot,"This is a nice stock pot, especially for the price. This is not the best stock pot in the world. It looks good and cooks very well. Some here are complaining about rust, discolored food, or stains in the pots. Fortunately, I have not seen any of these issues. The bottom is thick enough to heat evenly on a gas stove. The lid is nice. The sides are thin.I would like to have a stockpot that's a little heavier and has thicker sides. If I were doing this again I'd spend more money for a heavier pot. I'm giving it 4 stars for the quality relative to the price. If you want a nicer stock pot, you can pay more and get one. While I'd like a nicer pot, this one servers my needs."
1,This pot rusts!,"I do not recommend this item; I bought it, used it 4-5 times, and let it soak in water overnight once. The next morning, the pot had rusted around the top of the pot (the water line area) and in a few spots at the bottom of the pot. This is not supposed to happen to a stainless steel pot! Since I bought it online, I cannot exchange it at a local store, either - I have to go to the manufacturer (and who saves the papers that come with a pot?). The size of the pot is great, but be warned: it rusts."
5,You should get two of these!,"I'm not sure if Amazon is ever going to run another sale on Cuisinart Chef's Classic, but compared to retail prices, their everyday price is a great bargain. I got my second sauce pot when they ran the sale for $14. I can make spaghetti and sauce without juggling pan sizes, lids or being annoyed! I love it!!"
4,Not So Stainless Steel,"The Good: I love the broad bottom of the 6 quart pot which makes it easy to sauté a lot of vegetables or brown a large batch of meat.The Bad: The 3 quart pan feels much heavier than it is, because the handle does not help distribute the weight of the pan. The lip of both pans seems almost sharp, I would prefer the edges to be rounded smooth.The Ugly: These pans can stain and then become difficult to clean. Boiling liquid in the pan leaves a thick ring around the inside at the water level. I think it was just our hard water leaving a mineral film on the pans after boiling. Bar Keeper's Friend does the trick to clean the pans.Still all of the good things about these pans outweigh the bad."
2,Not totally happy with this pot!,"Based on all the rave reviews, I went ahead and ordered one of these pots from Amazon.Though the constuction is good, it is too light as the metal is too thin, esp. the lid, which is so thin, I am affraid it will get bent.The bottom is the only part with good thickness.I quess I should have known by the price.A 6qt pot by All-Clad would have been 4 times more money, but also 4 times the weight.I still like the pot, it's just not as robust as I hoped."
3,Frustrating,"This book is not what I was hoping for. I've downloaded free training plans from the internet (Troy Jacobson in particular) that were just excellent, with scheduled workouts spelled out clearly. There is too much guessing and jumping back and forth between chapters, appendices, and training charts in Gale's book. Not to mention typos and missing information. This is not a user-friendly book. 3 stars at best."
2,Poorly edited,"This book was evidently compiled from a variety of magazine articles the author had written over the years, and it doesn't look like the editor put much effort into turning the magazine articles into a book.For example, the first sprint distance training plan has codes ""E1"", ""E2"", etc. The next page says that you can find details of those codes in Chapter 25. Well, there is no Chapter 25 in the book. If it's just a typo, it's not the only one...On that same sprint distance training plan, the author mentions that some of the runs are performed in (heart rate) Zone 3. The plan doesn't include any Zone 3 runs, though.I could cite more examples, but in summary, the book is very poorly organized. If the training plans are any good (and they may well be), then maybe it's worth the effort to decode them. Otherwise, you'd probably be better off trying another book."
2,Not a 'panacea' book,"I bought this book with the hope to find the 'perfect' plan for every competition need. Actually you can choose among some plans but you must be lucky to find those appropriate for you. It does not provide a way to build your custom plan. If a personalized training plan is your primary need (... as it should), it's better to rely on books as Friel's Triathlon Training Bible."
5,works great for IT band problems,One of the main reason runners get IT band pain is weak stabilizer muscles. This band allows a quick and comfortable way to strengthen some key stabilizer muscles.
1,"Poor quality, breaks almost instantly","I have now broken two of these in less than 5 minutes. I am not doing anything crazy, just simple curls and shoulder shrugs. Both broke in the same area, where the strap attaches to the cord. Will just return and try another brand."
4,Pretty good desktop solution,"This laptop stand does really well for propping your laptop up at eye-level. I like that it's mesh, since it keeps my computer from overheating. The number of height options are nice. It comes with a cord organizer that clips onto the back, which I was pretty excited about, but which often falls off of the laptop stand and doesn't do that well at keeping cords where you want them. If you're looking for a stand, this one's great. If you're looking for a more complex desktop organizing solution, I recommend a separate cord organizer."
2,Misleading,"After two returns I'm now done with this product. The first one I received was shipped in the box it came in (which is pretty weird to begin with) and the product was fine at first I thought. Then I set it up and realized that 1. The stand is crooked at all heights and leans to one side badly and 2. The cord organizer that was supposed to come with it was not in the package and it does not have the smaller support bar pictured. I though maybe there had just been a mistake so I settled on exchanging it for a new one. When it came in the box it was shipped in and the product box were both crushed and the stand was bent again. Once again my laptop would not sit straight on it. I;m now done with this product as as great as it seems, its just not worth the hassel anymore"
2,Poor Fit,"It simply did not hold my Lenovo laptop. The depth of the base plate was too shallow, causing the computer to just slide out and down the front of the unit. I had pre-measured prior to ordering too, so was surprised that the laptop was too high for this unit per the advertised specs. Otherwise, solidly made and probably would have fit a thinner laptop."
2,Poor design,"This laptop stand will not hold my computer reliably. I have a Acer Aspire 7741 series laptop. The case design comes to a taper where the lid and body meet. The rolodex stand's holders> the 2 feet that actually brace the laptop on the stand, are too short! As soon as you touch the laptop, it slides right over the too short holders and onto the floor. I think some designer didn't think all aspects through. All it would take is the 2 holders to be 1/4 to 1/2 inch taller and there would be no slippage, which is what I have done. Instead of returning it, I have modified it by gluing 2 small pieces of rubber weatherstripping to the holders. This has raised the edge of the holders the required 1/2 inch needed. Rolodex>I will sell you my design mod for a reasonable fee> take the money out of said designer's salary, because he obviously isn't earning it! Anybody else needing help with their stand contact me, and I will show you how I did the mod.The rest of the stand seems to be ok."
4,Pretty good,I have a larger laptop (Thinkpad) so I'd prefer just slightly larger tabs so I know my cats aren't going to knock it over when it's at a steep angle. It does have rubber pads on the tabs though that keep it in place. Overall I'd give it almost a five. It'd be five if it was a little cheaper and had bigger tabs.
4,Rolodex Laptop stand is a great addition for home office,"The Rolodex laptop stand is a great addition to a home office. Not only does it give a more useful position for a laptop, it provides additional cooling for the laptop. The mesh construction allows better airflow, set the desired angle for typing and viewing and the metal construction is sturdy and does not flex when you are typing. A very useful product."
2,Junk! Unstable!,"While reading some reviews of this. I managed to jerk the laptop off of the stand. Just a small tug on the mouse cord sent it flying off. Or I should it fell off because the 'feet' that hold the laptop are too SMALL.It doesn't take much to teeter it off. My laptop is only a 2008 Gateway 15"" screen so therefore it's not big! Save money and many cuss words! If I would have saved my box and receipt I would have gotten my money back long ago. Now I'm gonna just try to rigged something up to keep it on there. The only good thing about this stand is the airflow it provides."
1,Useless,It may be OK for a very small laptop but but my Toshiba Satellite A660 (15.6 inch monitor) did not fit. This stand is not sturdy at all and it was not designed for medium sized laptops.Went back to Amazon.
2,Flimsy and Not Worth Buying,"I bought this laptop stand because of all the good reviews here but when I received this I was extremely disappointed and frustrated. This stand is very flimsy and bent almost immediately when I attempted to lock in the stand. Wobbly and not reliable, my laptop slipped off the stand twice and cannot stay put. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who has a 17"" laptop, perhaps a very small Mac would or iPad would be ok."
1,laptop slides off!,This does not securely hold a Dell Inspiron - thankfully mine fell on my chair instead of all the way to the floor when it slid off. Use with caution!
5,This is a great stand,"For the price provided, this stand is well worth the money. It's sturdy and reliable. My 17 inch laptop sits on it perfectly. This stand is extremely well ventilated too. I sure am glad I bought this!"
5,"ROLODEX ""METAL"" LAPTOP STAND (82410)","LAPTOP METAL ADJUSTABLE STAND: I bought this item back in 2008 from an office supply outlet. This is a great item, the mesh wire allows for cooling, the table tilts at various angles to easily see the keyboard. I purchased this item again for another laptop. I grap the stand and laptop and move them together. I did add felt pads where the laptop rests on the stop just for added protection. The adjustments bars are sturdy and have many slots so the laptop can be angled from low to very high."
5,It was a hit!,"Purchased this for my 25 yr old niece, who works for a non-profit organization. She said that it was a perfect gift and that her dad was going to order one for himself! Anytime a item is that much of a hit, I consider purchasing it for daughters, or other nieces."
5,Great Deal,I thought the stand was a great deal. It brought my laptop up to the same height as my other monitor so I am able to work more efficiently.
3,Laptop slides off this stand needs help,"Have a 17.3"" Hp pavilion laptop at 8.5 LBS. This stand is useless with this laptop as the laptop slides off the stand even on its lowest elevation. To make it work I used a rubber shelf liner with holes this liner makes the surface tacky by gripping the metal mesh and the laptop. The laptop doesn't move even in an elevated position rendering the short front tabs as stabilizers. Couldn't get a different stand at this price."
5,Rolodex Laptop Stand,"If you are looking for a better-than-average laptop stand this isthe one. It was as advertised, packed well and arrived quickly. Dollar-for-value, this is a very reasonable product. I would recommend to othersand I have purchased several as gifts for others who have seenmy personal stand. Go for it."
5,Excellent Riser Stand,"I bought this for my wife to use with her 17"" HP Notebook at home. She is very happy with it. It's a great riser stand for use at home or office, and would be good for any size notebook or laptop. I think it would be too bulky to carry in a laptop case."
1,came defective twice,product came defective. exchanged it and am in the process of returning second item (which I believe to be the very one I returned) because it too is defective. (legs don't go into notches evenly on both sides so stand wobbles when using laptop)
2,Unstable,"I think that the manufacturer should have spent a little more material on the front ""bumpers"" which should prevent the laptop from sliding. They are slightly shorter than my laptop's bottom, causing it to slide down all the time. Every time I need to plug/unplug cords or USB devices, it slides down, and sometimes it slips by itself. Ten milimeters more would make it perfect. The way it is, I'll have to replace it soon."
2,"good materials, poorly constructed","since the particular laptop i just ordered is known to stay exceptionally cool without the use of a cooling pad, i decided to just get something stable to put it on and keep an eye on the temperature without active cooling.this would have been perfect for passive heat dissipation, but when i opened the box i discovered it is poorly constructed. you can see the metal hinge that supports the top platform in the picture; that hinge slides into one of several pairs of grooves on the back of the platform. the metal bits with the grooves are soldered on, but with the stand i received, one was soldered about a half an inch lower than the other. i can fit the stand into a pair of grooves, but the whole thing is unstable as a result of the asymmetry.perhaps someone who is handier than i could correct this, or perhaps other customers receive better made stands. this one, however, is going back."
3,Good product,"I have been using this for the last two months. My Sony VAIO laptop used to generate lot of heat when I keep it in my lap and I cannot work more than 15 min. After buying this, I am able to work it continuously and provides you an elevation which is great which working on the laptop. Overall good value for the money."
1,Big disappointment,"I should have returned this as soon as I opened the box. Because when I pulled the package out of the box it was shipped in the box inside had been pretty trashed. But I figured nothing was actually missing so I'll give it a shot. The stand itself isn't a failure but if I was shopping again for a laptop stand I definitely wouldn't get this one. My biggest complaint is probably that the biggest reason I bought this stand was because of how other people raved about the cord keeper. It's a very simple design with a piece of rubber that slides into some slots on the back of the stand.... and doesn't stay there. The piece slides around/comes off way too easily and frankly is probably more trouble than it is worth. So if you like this stand because it has several height options, you might be happy with it. If you love the idea of a cord keeper on the stand, you, like myself, are probably going to be greatly disappointed by it."
2,Not very sturdy,"The first one needed replacement because of missing parts, so I could not tell how was it. When I finally got the one that works, I found that the construction is rather wobbly."
3,"Nice stand, but not as described","This is a pretty nice stand as far as laptop stands go. It has a sturdy metal mesh design that allows plenty of airflow and has enough structural integrity to hold a laptop of any size (including my giant, 12lb Dell XPS Gen 1). You can also adjust it to a pretty wide range of angles. As others have stated, the cord organizer is a nice bonus.Be aware that this is *only* a stand, and does not include a USB hub. There is a spot in the base of the stand where you can install a Rolodex USB hub module, but that is sold separately.For $25, this would be a five-star steal if it was a stand/USB hub combo. Without the hub, it's basically a fairly cheap, decent stand that doesn't really stand out from the crowd."
5,Great laptop stand!,"Adjustable, very sturdy and gives the laptop good ventilation. Can't beat it for the price. The cord keeper on the back makes it so that the power cord/usb hub cords don't fall off the back. Awesome."
5,Perfect for the Lenovo U330,"Heat was not an issue with theLenovo U330 13.3-Inch IdeaPad (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P7350 Processor, 3 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium) Black, but the pain in my middle back was. I was hunching over to use the laptop, but this stand has solved the problem. I can sit straight up and type comfortably using the lowest position. The U330 fits perfectly and none of the ports or CD drive are blocked."
2,"There is no ""Handy Drawer""","The product details clearly state in two places:""A handy drawer conveniently tucks away note pads, pens, pencils and other supplies that might add to desk clutter"" which was why I purchased this item - but there is no drawer."
2,Does not hold laptop securely at steeper inclines...,Most laptops have beveled bottoms and the holding arms of this stand do not extend far enough out to keep the laptop secured at steeper inclines.
1,"IS NOT COMBO, THE DEAL IS A FAKE","The only thing of value in the combo pack is the car charger/power supply. The cover/case for the phone is a joke and wouldn't be worth having if it was free. I tossed the cover/case, kept the charger and bought separate holster for the cell phone. Don't waste money on this combo.Its no fix to RAZR V3."
1,No Value Combo Pack,"The only thing of value in the combo pack is the car charger/power supply. The cover/case for the phone is a joke and wouldn't be worth having if it was free. I tossed the cover/case, kept the charger and bought separate holster for the cell phone. Don't waste money on this combo."
3,phone case over time started to break down,phone case over time started to break down. Love the car charger though.
1,mixed feelings,the cover is a joke. looks incredibly cheap/ugly. i don't know if the car charger works or not. i'll update the review when i know.
1,Junk,"I received this from Amazon.com after complaining that my pink Razr didn't come with the leather case that is advertised with it. Needless to say, I ended up buying one on my own. YES this thing stinks, and no it doesn't fit the phone. I didn't even bother trying the car charger.I would have given this ZERO stars, but they don't give you that option."
2,"Charger OK, the case went into the trash",I agree with previous reviews: Amazon should not even carry the case and sell the charger by itself.The case looks like it was produced by slave labor in aconcentration camp. It should be sent back to China!
3,Razr V3 Combo Pakc,The leather looks cheap and charger doesn't work unless it is plugged in a certain way..
2,Not a good buy.,"I love the car charger, but the case looks so cheap, and ugly! Great price for the items, but I'd have to pass on the fake alligator case."
3,Pretty Good,"Well, i can't say that this is one of the greatest emo cd's u'll ever hear, but its definately a really good one. Great lyrics, good singing and totally soaring melodies meld to produce an overall enjoyable record. Its probably nothing you havn't heard before, but its totally worth a listen and i would reccomend it to anyone who likes melodic rock and emo."
1,Tilts in the HDMI socket and loses signal!,"Got one of these adapters because it was a lot cheaper than buying an HDMI-HDMI cable. BAD IDEA! The DVI cable end screws into this adapter ok, but then the completed assembly is too heavy, causing it to tilt at an angle from the HDMI socket on my DVD player and lose the signal. I had to support the adapter behind the player with some magazines to keep it from tilting. Save yourself some trouble and buy an HDMI cable."
1,Product does not match Item Description listed on Amazon .Com site,Ships incorrect items. Product recieved does not match Product Site Description listed on Amazon.com
5,Unbeatable quality,"I have been always using monster product when ever quality matters,i have tried cheap dvi to hdmi adapter for my projector,there was no picture when playing HD content,with the monster adapter,the quality was nothing sort of amazing, superior image & colors,and guess what?only for 30$."
5,H.H.H.H.-HOT HOLY HIP HOP(E),"AFTER A 3 YEAR HIATUS,CM IS BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER.THE BEATS ON THIS ALBUM PUT THEIR PREVIOUS WORK ON ICE.THERE ARE A FEW WEAK TRACKS ON HERE,BUT THIS IS ONE OF GOSPEL RAP'S BEAT ALBUMS EVER.""IF NOT OF"" IS THE HOTTEST RAP SONG EVER,PERIOD.""WHEN I FLOW"", ""ITS GOIN DOWN"" ""CRY NO MORE"" AND ""LIVE IT"" ALONG WITH THE ABOVE ARE THE ALBUMS BEST.THE ONLY WEAK TRACKS ARE THE TITLE CUT AND A FEW OTHERS.THEY SEEM TO HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVERY ALBUM,THANK GOD T.R.U. L.I.F.E. IS BACK.TONIC IS HOTTER THAN EVER,AMBASSADOR AND PHANATIK ARE GOOD TOO, THANK GOD ENOCH INSN'T HERE.THIS ALBUM IS HOT,PICK IT UP"
5,Great focus!,I was looking for Christian rap from my teens and happened upon CM and The Ambassador!I must applaud you all! The beats are great and so are the messages being delivered. Keep on with your ministry and putting God first; I think that kids (and adults) will enjoy what you have produced!PS: I have visited your website as well...fabulous!
4,Better than I expected,"I've seen THE THREEPENNY OPERA half a dozen times. I didn't have much hope for the movie, especially given the production team, and was quite pleasantly surprised. Raul Julia is as good a MacHeath as I've seen, and Richard Harris is an excellent Peacham. As for Leonard Maltin, if he thinks Bobby Darin has anything to do with the true flavor of THE THREEPENNY OPERA, he's a bigger jerk than even I thought he was."
5,"Archaic, Homely, Beautiful Voice","Although Callicott's guitar playing skills had diminished since the 1920s and 1930s, he has an archaic, homely and beautiful voice on this disc. It's a highly enjoyable album, especially considering how it comes from Fat Possum Records, who is not known to produce good material, or material that can even be deemed Blues. ""Frankie And Albert"" is wonderful, but, really, every track is a keeper. It's a shame that the liner notes are so skimpy, but the packaging is still very nice. Fat Possum's McDowell and Furry Lewis albums are also great. Callicott seems to be a mixture of John Hurt and Frank Stokes in terms of vocals."
3,"Not for ActionScript 2.0, MX Pro 2004 users.","This book says that it's meant for experienced senior J2EE developers, it bascially goes on and on about what a typical XP project is like. Too many dialogs explaining what different patterns are, and why we should use it, and why testing is good. Goes over MVC, Business Delegate, etc, but not thorough enough. People working with J2EE would already have that knowledge. And of course being from ""Macromedia Press"" this book mentions a lot of Macromedia's products, ie JRun. Overall it is a decent book, but don't buy it if you're expecting to learn MX 2004/Actionscript 2.0 code."
1,Verbal Diarrhea,"On and on it goes. Every trifling detail of the boring ""real world"" projects. If you work in the industry it will remind you of work too much.It doesn't go into Web Service Connectors with Flash MX 2004 Professional either, so buy something else that does."
3,From cover & first page,"From the back cover :The time is a few decades in the future: the place is what used to be the United States of America, now disrupted by internal factionalism as well as a short-lived foreign invasion. Out of this chaotic background, Ron Goulart has produced an imaginative, fast-paced and constantly delightful odyssey through our possible future.Inside front cover :Ron Goulart's incredible vision of the not-to-distant future includes:The Nixon Institute, where aging former rock stars reminisce about the days when they still had hair;The wide-open town of San Rafael, run by the Amateur Mafia (no Italians allowed);Vienna West, a detailed replica of Sigmund Freud's 19th Century city where psychiatric patients live and abreact together;The Monterey Mechanical Jazz Festival, featuring the music of pinball machines, jack hammers and washing machines...All this plus a dozen or two of the oddest characters you're ever likely to meet. After Things Fell Apart is a very funny book."
5,Touching Documentary on Johnny Cash,"Although Johnny Cash was never my favorite singer, I have always liked the spirit and sincerity of his music, especially since I was able to meet him briefly in 1990, when he was still healthy and in very good voice. This video brings to life Johnny's spiritual side, from his earliest years, through his many struggles that persisted throughout his career, and to his last days that brought a resurgence of his popularity. His knowledge of the Bible and his certainty of God's constant love and forgiveness continually brought him back to his roots. This video contains documentary footage that is touching, inspiring, and encouraging. In fact, when my wife and I first viewed it, we determined to buy extra copies as gifts for family members. I highly recommend it as one to enjoy viewing many times over."
1,Very poor quality,"Having already owned this title, I bought this dvd, big mistake, very poor quality, much worse than the vhs I already had, which actually looks quite good in comparison."
4,The valley of the Kings,"I found the DVD fascinating as I only knew of the existence of the film very recently. I was a little disappointed that the film was not in widescreen format, but then maybe it wasn't produced that way. The colour was quite splendid even if the acting presentation seemed a little stilted.I spent a month in Egypt in January 2011 so it was interesting to see how much the historical scenes have changed. Having been to Abu Simbel I was interested in looking at my photos to where the ""tomb"" in the facade was supposed to be. Obviously the fight scene on one of Rameses II's statue heads would not have been on real thing, in those days, many of the tomb interior shots would have had to have been recreated in a studio. Since Seti I's tomb is off limits today, from what I have seen of photos I find it hard to believe that that tomb was used for for the movie.I found the film quite enjoyable."
5,Enthusiastically recommended for hikers & campers,"Wonderfully illustrated throughout with maps and b/w photos, Backpacking Wisconsin is a comprehensive guide and informative overview to the best Wisconsin has to offer the outdoor enthusiast and hiker. For each recreational excursion surveyed the aspiring backpacker will find complete directions for getting there; information on entrance fees and permits, campsites, and contacts; detailed trail maps with keys to roads, parking, trail shelters, water supplies, and outhouses; ratings for trails, scenery, quiet, solitude, and points of interest; background information on history, geology, and terrain; trail notes describing trees, shrubs, wild flowers, birds, and mammals. Backpacking Wisconsin is an indispensable, success enhancing, outdoor recreation and travel guide. Enthusiastically recommended for hikers, campers, bird watchers, and nature lovers."
5,"Lord, Heal My Hurts","This a very good study for how to trust and turn our hurts over to the Lord, the great healer."
3,my review,The book was in good condition but the previous owner had made written notes through the book. I would have liked to have known this.The hand written notes were in ink and impossible to get rid of.
3,for groupies,"I was not disappointed because I wanted to know more about the man of whom I'd heardjust a bit.But the writer was too amateur. I suppose a good editor would have helped.The Foreword was beautifuuly written, ""sub specie aeternatis"""
3,Entertaining but should have focused more on the Slasher aspect,"I enjoyed The Rites Of Spring to a degree, I just wish that they would have concentrated on the Horror/Slasher aspect of the film instead of taking up so much time with the kidnapping sub plot. I feel they were a bit too ambitious especially with a running time of an hour and 20 minutes.It felt it borrowed from Malevolence and The Messengers 2..I won't say why but you will be able to decipher for yourself.The slasher aspect was very cool, well done and if it had been an entire film about ""The Rites Of Spring"" I would have loved it,the creature was mad cool and the gore was plentiful for the time that story line was given.The characters were interwoven cleverly even though I really had to watch it a second time to really understand how each character was connected.The acting was good for a low budget film especially Anessa Ramsey and AJ Bowen..All in all worth a watch and better than most that are being pumped out lately."
2,Scarey and shocking,I was planning on eating while watching this movie. After 15 to 20 minutes that thought was gone. It was shocking scary and everything I thought a movie like this should be. I started writing this review while watching it thinking this was a good thriller/horror film. I liked it a lot ready to give it 4 stars until the movie just ended without any conclusion like it just stopped. The film ended unfinished in my opinion all they needed was like 5 minutes to give it an ending. Basically in the end when you are expecting everyone to be caught or get away who lives or dies the screen went black 15 seconds later the words start coming. The movies was over.
4,Another quality album from the Souls...,"The Bouncing Souls always put out quality work and the Gold Record doesn't fail to live up to their rep. I really like a number of their tracks that clearly standout on this one. The overall recording sounds much better than the last. Still, I don't think this album outdoes some of their finest (and earlier) work such as the self-titled album or the classic Maniacal Laughter. As a Philly native, the Souls never cease to amaze me every time they come through town or whenever they put out their latest line of work. You've got to give these boys props- they know how to rock."
3,Pretty good album,"I enoyed parts of this album, but still found myself skipping some songs on it. Overall it's quite good and worth the money, and I have to say that the song ""Letter from Iraq"" is one of the most powerful punk rock songs I've heard in recent years. Liek I said, good, but not great."
3,Good cd,"This cd is good. Not as fast as the past efforts. Two covers:""Lean of Sheena"" by Avoid One Thing and ""Better Things"" by The Kinks. So it is really 10 songs. The first 2 songs are the best. The cd slows down after that a little."
2,Where's the Energy?,"This album was mediocre at best. I really liked every Bouncing Souls CD before this one, because they all have a lot of energy to them and are fun to listen to. This one has a couple of decent songs, but nothing like what I'm used to out of the souls. I guess you might like this CD if you're into EMO, but not if you're looking for something like the Souls have put out in times past."
5,A tremendous album,"This is a great album. They call their music 'folky kinda music', and I guess that's as good a description as any. The music is somewhere in the alt.country sphere, over there next to folk. Great tunes, wailin' harmonica, and a laid-back lyrical sensibility add up to an unexpected formula for an Australian band.One of the best of 2003."
4,Rooted Wanderers,"The Waifs are from Australia and they never forget it, even as all three write and sing of distance and rootlessness. The sound features wonderful harmonies between the two Simpson sisters, excellent harmonica on almost every song, and can be country-bluesy (Flesh and Blood), 60's-like (London Still), or recall some Lucinda Williams Louisiana-style yearning (Highway One). Every five cuts or so up pops a song from Joshua Cunningham who speaks (a smoother Tom Waits and very like his countryman Paul Kelly) more than sings his lyrics and looks back to things gone, either by twenty years (Since I've Been Around) or one night (Up All Night). Three Down is standard ""oh-how-hard-it-is-to-be-on-the-road"" stuff, but all the other eleven songs are fresh takes on the performers's universal themes -- love, loss, home and the road. Aside from the ones I've mentioned already, I especially liked Fourth Floor and Lighthouse."
4,another stellar effort,"although their 2nd album remains my favourite to date, this is another fantastic effort by the Aussie trio. Coming off a tour opening for Dylan, The Waifs are *this close* to becoming a name in the US. Have a listen, take a chance - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Excellent Album,"This is one of the best albums I have ever bought (I own about 200). I saw the Waifs play at the Newport Folk Fest a few years ago, and fell in love with them, not just because of the two beautiful lead woman, with irresistible Aussie accents, but their fun, well written music. I highly recommend it."
1,dead CD,Beware of faulty CD! I've been a big fan of Topo! for a long time. I have several state CD sets. The software has gradually improved over the years. This single CD of Colorado doesn't work. It installs fine but doesn't see any of the maps on the CD. It was stupid of me to throw out the packaging so I guess I'm screwed :-(
5,Nice 3-point snack!,"I love these things. Amazon is the only place I found to order these Cheddar Fries. The 1 oz. bag is the perfect snack size, especially for those on WW. Each 1 oz. bag is 3 points. Not bad for a ""junk food"" snack!! Awesome price and fast delivery!"
3,its all right,"its a good price for the money,not as heavy duty as people/ and the description says.but it is one of the biggest SS pans you can get.I expect it to last a year or so until it needs replaced."
2,Cusinart Pan,"The pan works fine and is as expected for this price range saute pan. The box was intact and unblemished, however the pan and lid had a dent along the rim. I did not have the time to send this back as it was ordered specifically for a trip to the coast. I would not blame amazon as again, the box showed no signs of damage, however I cannot in good conscience rate this higher."
3,It's very durable.,"This is a nice big pan! I bought one previously on clearance and assumed this would be about the same size, it wasn't. This pan even has a soft, rubber handle on it. It's very durable. I cook every day and try out new recipes. I couldn't find a pan like this in stores."
3,burnt up with first use,"I was super excited to get this pan, but with the first use it burnt up. I was cooking with plenty of olive oil on medium heat, so I am not sure what else I could have done to prevent this. It seems like an amazing quality item - heavy weight, etc, but I cannot figure out how to cook with it without the metal burning itself. The pan is now black and I do not use it (after a total of 2 uses)."
4,Lid is steel as well - not glass lid!,"It looked to me like the lid on the product picture on Amazon was glass, but it is not. It is stainless steel. Not a huge big deal but I feel it was misleading. Looks like a nice pan. I haven't used it yet but was surprised it was not glass. I did see a review that said it was not glass so I wondered, but I thought maybe they were commenting on the wrong product. Probably not a great deal at $50-some but I think it will be worth the price and not having to go out and shop for it in person made it worth buying for me with a 4 month old baby.Update: This is a really heavy pan and although it has a side handle, it's still really hard for me to drain fat from it b/c of its weight. It really hurts my wrists a lot and I'm not a small girl."
5,Cuisinart 5.5 quart pan,"Great pan, well worth the price and is great for stove top and oven use,love this pan."
5,Perfection,"I bought an 8pc set for my wife for Christmas. After she opened her gift, we jumped back online and ordered separate pieces to complete the set. These pans are a joy to cook with and a breeze to clean. Grab 'em while you can."
1,Pan is warped!,"This pan has serious problems. The bottom warped inward and now it is basically useless on my stove. I mailed the pan back to the company because it was under warranty but they said that the warranty was voided because I overheated the pan. That is ridiculous and untrue. I never turned my stove anywhere near high when using this pan.Furthermore, I just read other reviews online of other people who had the same problem! Some are here on Amazon.I have a cheap set of pans from Walmart and they never had this problem! What a rip off."
4,Dented,"Great Pan for Great Price, too bad Amazon doesn't invest in another box to ship it, mine arrived with a big dent in the lip so the lid doesn't fit quite right."
4,Very useful pan,"I find this pan very useful, cleans up pretty easily. My only complaint is that it is so very heavy. But overall, I'm glad I have it."
5,works well and easy to clean,Was going to buy a much more expensive model but decided on this one and have been pleased with its performance.
1,I expect more than two years of service,I really liked this pan for two years until the bottom warped. This happened to me before. That makes twice in over 60 years of cooking. I had used the other pan for over 45 years. I wrote to Cusinart but have not received a reply. From other reviews I am led to expect that they will not replace.
4,the everything pan,i bought this pan for its versatility. the size is perfect for one person. all my other cookware is cuisinart so i knew the quality would be good.
5,Papa Z,I was first worried about how light weight this saute pan was for the size. I was concerned that it would not be durable. But so far it has been very durable and very easy to clean up. The 5.5 Qt size is perfect for large meals. Very good purchase.
5,cuisinart saute pan,i can not say enough about this pan. it was even nicer than i thought it would be. i am so very satisfied!!!!!!!!!thank you so much.
2,"Heavy, Sticky","If you like really heavy pans that food sticks to and is hard to clean, this pan is for you."
3,Great pan for the old low price. However -,"I bought it when it was offered at a bargain price, and it's a well constructed implement, no problems there. But - I still use my old, trusty crusty rusty great big cast iron skillet for most of the things this size pan is good for, even acidic tomato-based sauces. I'd hesitate to buy the Cusinart at the current price."
3,Heat spot a problem for me,"This pan was purchased @ Macy's when they had a great deal for it. I was so elated to have saved so much money. I loved the weight, the additional handle, the size, the side height and cover. However, I now wish I had purchased All-Clad instead. After 30 year of using the same stainless set, I am updating my kitchen and I use ATK equipment reviews to help me purchase the best for the least. America's Test Kitchen review did mention a hot spot, but they still recommended it but I cannot. The hot spot is about 3 1/2 inches center and when dealing with a 12 1/2 inch surface that leaves a lot of uneven cooking. Also, compared to my other stainless I dont' like how it cleans up - as it constantly looks dirty."
5,What a great pan!,"I needn't have worried about where to store it. It gets so much use it is rarely put away. A most versatile piece of equipment. Even heat, easy cleanup, perfect size for so many different tasks, as other reviewers agree. (More than you'd imagine until you actually start using it.) A pleasure to use every time, and a great value at the sale price. Beautiful to look at, it also makes a great gift."
2,"i REALLY wanted to like this pan, but i don't.","i've had many cuisinart and caphalon products and like to think i know what i'm looking for in a pan...i read all of the other reviews about this pan and was happy to spend the money on it, but i was disappointed with it after the first use. my husband cooked some chicken in it, washed it right away, and couldn't get it clean. we soaked it, thinking we would be able to get it shiny and new again (after all, it WAS NEW!), but still, it stayed stained from cooking the chicken. 5 uses later it looks the same, if not worse. what a bummer. don't buy this pan unless you want to get frustrated or live with a pan you can't get clean."
4,Easy to use,"This was easier to use than anticipated. The idea that it could test ""all"" batteries is something that I've been looking for to give my husband since we have a lot of batteries laying around and not sure whether they were good or not."
4,hIP HOP KEEPER,"Yo this a west coast hip hop head, if ya love the realness, get this album. Got all the old skool, wit a lil bit of new skool, ya dig? If ya know real music, you'll followpeace"
4,I'll Be Seeing You,"I thought this book was very relisictic, because it dealt with everyday issues like physical apperence and being precived by you peers. Carly (the main character) had a scar on her face left from an operation she had when she was younger to get rid of a brain tumor. But it left her face scared and no one could do anything about it. She's in a hospital because she broke her leg rollerblading and it didn't heal right. She meets Kyle a boy left blind after a chemical explosion. Knowing he probably will never see her she decides not to tell him about her face. This book is wonderful on how it dictates how she feels and what she thinks about herself. I give this 4 stars."
5,Beauty is only skin deep,"I was introduced to this book by a friend who loaned it to me. I enjoyed it so much, I later went out and bought it myself. I identified with Carley because although I don't have a scarred face like she does, I've never really thought I was pretty. Love came to her in the form of Kyle, a blind boy that she met in the hospital after she broke her leg. Will their relationship end if his sight returns? Read it to find out. This was an inspirational story. It gave me hope that if someone with Carley's problem can be loved, then I have a chance for romance too. Buy ""I'll Be Seeing You"" ASAP! I highly reccomend it to anyone in need of hope."
5,i think it was great it had a lot of depth and clarity,it was a great book it was so great i read it in one night good work Lurlene keep it up...
3,"Okay, but not great","I love all the Lurlene McDaniel books, but this one wasn't as good. I thought that how Carley tried to deceive Kyle was shallow. Throughout the whole book there was a sense of dishonesty."
3,Needed To Do Their Homework,"I sent this DVD to my father for Father's Day, because he has a great interest in the civil war, and has studied it for many years.When I asked him how he liked it, he tried to be polite, but had to admit that while interesting, the accuracy was poor. While describing one battle, scenes were shown of a completely different location. He has visited these sites, and knows one from the other."
3,does not fit fat doors,"only fits on skinny doors but makes a perfect towel hanger on the back of any bathroom door, only recommend for bathrooms"
2,Not my kind of jazz,"Read a great review of this CD, so purchased without having heard it. I did not enjoy it as I had expected."
2,Somewhat sentimental jazz with some latin and bop,"Listen to this album if you don't object that the majority of jazz these days is still strongly based in bop, if you don't object to the occasional latin influences, or if you are simply a fan of Rollins. However, if you are more into some more exciting, tenser, or simply darker music (be it jazz or not), and if you have a hard time listening to things that lean towards sentimentality, this is not an album for you.There is quite a difference between the first and second half of the album though. Rollins seems to want to make sure to attract the attention of hardbop adapts on the first track, and go for some latin on track two. Apart from that, the album consists of ballads mostly, which are actually not bad and have decent solos. The only exciting track, if you ask me, is the title song. Considering the electronic bass and guitar, the basis of the music invites for a relaxing listening experience."
5,"Thoughtful, Easy to Understand Introduction to Prejudice","This Berenstain book introduces the issues of bigotry and prejudice very well. Pandas move across the street, and Papa Bear is immediately suspicious and a bit miffed by their arrival. He misunderstands the new bears gestures such as planting bamboo sticks for food, and assumes it is an insulting fence. One really delightful thing about this book is the calm easy accuracy about prejudice. Children will relate to Papa's fears and concerns, but they will also understand how incorrect his feelings are when the children bears befriend each other. It shows how easy it is too make an untrue and unfair assumption about another individual. (Interestingly enough, unlike the Arthur books by Marc Brown, this is one of the very few Berenstain Bear books with different looking animals!) The book really works!"
3,Skip this; get Dann Habe Ich Umsonst Gelebt.,"If you're torn between this album andDann Habe Ich Umsonst Gelebt Re-release, I recommend the latter. This album is mostly remixes ofDann Habe Ich Umsonst Gelebt Re-release, but I disgree completely with the previous reviewer; These remixes are horrible. I was sorely disappointed, since I love the original songs.""Rearranging"" sounds like a bunch of noise. ""Slut,"" which is a song that makes me laugh normally, just sounds like crap. Thomas' voice on ""Epitaph"" is put through some distortion that makes him sound like an evil tranny. Some of Sonja's beautiful vocals are stripped off of ""Was Hält Mich Noch Hier"".I have nothing good to say about the remixes.I gave this three stars, because I love the original songs, and at least there is a second disc with live videos."
5,"A charming, inventive novel","A thirteen-year-old, Christopher, is a troublemaker. But when he goes into a supposedly haunted house, he meets a man who shows him how to use powers he never knew he had, such as telepathy and invisibility. Christopher experiments with these and returns to the house to learn a new lesson. In the end, he emerges from the house with a heightened sense of consciousness, a troublemaker no more."
5,INTRIGUING ACTION FILM,"This film was very intriguing, and good action. Well made, and good acting by the actors. The hitman assasin held my attention because he did a good acting job. I was very surprised at the ending. One of the those movies you can watch over and over again. To all you critics, make and act in your own movie before you critize others work. I hate people who constantly have to critize anything no matter how good the work is, just jealous want to be's without a life, or their just snobs."
4,"Dark, disturbing, but strangely powerful.","I bought this DVD on a whim, thinking it might be a decent shoot-em-up if nothing else. Instead, I watched a disturbing, yet riveting film about a consumate hitman searching for someone to follow in his footsteps. The ghost-like assassin tests the man he has chosen as replacement. Unknowing and unwilling, the replacement tries desperately to foil him and protect his love-interest and friends. The assassin kills them all to ""free"" the ""prodigy"" of the things that would hold him back from his destiny.There are no silly car chases or unrealistic shootouts. It is the tale of a sadistic, yet cerebral killer playing a deadly game with another human being to make the younger man worthy of becoming his replacement.This was certainly *not* my kind of movie. Having said that, I was impressed by the power this film had to capture my attention and hold it."
2,how to train your hitman.,"first off this is an indi movie,and not a great one at that,i wish i had my $12. back i spent on it.it's got action.thats about all i have to say about it."
2,Just OK,"This movie was average at best. The acting and some of the action scenes are not bad, however the story does drag and the ending is very weak. Do yourself a favor and rent it if you must see it and save yourself the money... Luckily i bought a cheap pre-viewed copy!"
4,Great addition for your IPod,"I purchased this case as an addition to the silicon case that I already owened, and I like this case much better. I own the 80GB classic and I can keep the silicon case on my IPod and still fit it in within this leather case. I don't use the belt clip option, I only use the case, and it just goes into my briefcase or jacket pocket and it works out fine."
2,all good but not generous,"The case was satisfactory. I wanted a case that I could clip to my belt - before, I was carrying the ipod in my pants pocket. It has swievel clip that conforms to my movements, and the clip disconnects from the case if the case gets snagged. I cut off the lid because it was in the way of accessing the control button. I used it this way for a year or so, then I wanted to take the ipod out. It was impossible. The ipod was jammed into the case. Actually, I had to jam it into the case in the beginning. I had to cut the case to get the ipod. Although the case was satisfying for the intended use, I would not buy this again."
5,Excellent,"This leather cases are hand-stitched to create the perfect fit for my iPod Classic 80GB. There is a space on the base of the case for the dock connector. So, I don't have to remove the case to get my iPod charged and allows easy access to my headphone jack. And this pure leather case incorporates a flip frame that is hand-mounted wit full screen protector. I like this case very much while the case was arrived little bit later than the expected date. I also appreciate Eforcity providing a prompt reply when I asked for the shipping status of my order,"
1,not worth it,"Cover not worth it, does not fit right, smells like chemical. Swivel clip broke same day I used it, wrist strap irritated my skin."
3,ipod case,product I received is ideal to give added protection for my ipod while vacationing in different citiesvery good choice
1,Never again,"It came broken, the fell off and there is no way to fix it. The metal piece that holds the clip to the case came off the first time I tried to clip the case on to my belt..."
5,Great for the price......,"I have an old style 80GB iPod and it is a perfect fit for this model. It is hard to get into the case at first, but loosens up a bit after repeated removals. The belt clip seems sturdy and well made, and the case in general has a good padded feel to it in your hand. At a little over $3.00, and almost as much for shipping, I still think that it is a bargain. Recommended"
3,"Case is fine, but...","The case is fine, but the rotating ""hook"" for hooking it to one's belt sticks out too far. It does not easily fit into a Boze ear phone case like the older one I had for my older 80gb iPod . Otherwise it is fine."
2,The back hook broke!,"I travel a lot and take my iPod with me on the plane wherever I go. I like this case for the protection it provides my iPod, but the clip on the back comes undone too easily and, for me, broke rather quickly."
2,not that great,"I don't like this case, it really is a problem to place the connector to charge or sync music with the pc."
4,Just what she wanted,"I ordered this for my sister who wanted new cookware, but nothing treated for non-stick. The price was great and I held my breath until she received it and tried it out. She loves it! No problems with sticking food and clean up has been easy. She doesn't have a dishwasher so those concerns are moot. She likes the feel of the handles and the fit of the lids. While she hasn't put it in the oven yet, she doesn't anticipate any problems. This is my third purchase for her sight unseen and I seem to be batting 1000."
1,Beware...JUNK.,"I have the same set -Cuisinart 77-10- since 1995 which still looks as new today except for the main ones i use more than the others ...(2 and 3 Qt) pots which burned due to my negligence (one hour cooking on high totally on empty - was boiling water for coffee).So i thought it is time to buy a new set.... which I did March 2012, and after the second water boiling - (purified water nonetheless)- the pots became totally stained yellowish all over the inside not just up to the water level, and the bottom looks like it starting to separate... not to mention the meek and uncomfortable handle... Oh and did I mention the covers get very, very hot!One more thing, they removed the "" made in china"" WARNING from the bottom!All in all, it is a worthless set of JUNK! not even worth 1 star... though it is not Amazon's fault, but the doing of Cuisinart going down the abyss!"
4,Bent Pan Lip,"Largest saucepan had a lip that was bent, so it didn't seal when in use, had to flatten it on vice. Dissappointed in the manufacturing quality control."
3,Good looking set but....,"I got this set to replace an older Teflon set out of health concerns for the flaking Teflon coating. This set is very nice looking and appears to be well made; however, my biggest complaint is the fact that the food sticks to the bottom. I have to use a lot of oil in order to avoid this issue. So, what would you like to do? Eat Teflon or lots of grease? I am not sure either which is better. Trying to keep the set clean is also very hard, time-consuming and annoying. I tried lemon juice, vinegar, and all kind of cleaning products and no luck getting rid off the stain inside the frypans. would I buy it again? I am not sure."
3,They do the job,The cookware does the job. Heats up very quickly and cooks food evenly. I just wish that this kind of cookware could be made a little bit more idiot proof as I've already melted the bottom of a couple of them all over my stove.
2,Big cracks developed after 4 months,"I was very happy with my purchase until 2 big cracks appeared on the 3 QT saucepan. The return window expired. When I called Cusine-art for warranty claim, I was told I have to pay for shipping to New Jersey and enclose a $7 check for return shipping!I am very disappointed with such poor quality for a big name cookware set. I have been using stainless steel cookware all my life and never had issues. This is my first bad experience."
5,Very prompt delivery,"I do much of my Christmas shopping online and this cookware set was quite reasonably priced and quickly shipped. Already received, wrapped, and under the tree! Thank you so much. Oh, and I'll add that there was not even the thought of a dent to the box. Unlike the dishes my son had ordered elsewhere that arrived shattered the day before.For myself, extremely satisfied with all purchase criteria!"
4,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Cookware Set,"Very pleased with the quality. Received quickly. Upon retrospect,might have been better ordering pieces separately as a couple of the pieces in the set seem superfluous."
5,Greatest pans ever!,"I have had these pans for about a month now and have really given them a workout. They heat very evenly and quickly and the handles on the pans stay very cool- even at high temperatures. I did not find the handles on the lids to become overly hot either (although they did become a bit on the warm side when used for long periods of time- might want to keep a pot holder handy just in case). I found them easy to clean and they become shiny and wonderful all over again. I got a little gunk left on the bottom from blackened fish but the stainless pot cleaner took it right off and back to shiny again. I would definetly invest in some of this to keep things nice looking. Feels very sturdy and have a nice weight to them. I am not terribly strong in the hands/wrists but do not find the weight to be a problem. I am so happy with this set. My previous pots (Circulon) were lovely, but the non-stick finish is peeling off and it was time for a step up. A great buy!"
4,Good Bargain,"The Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless cookware set is a great value. A beautiful set that works well and cleans up easily. I read lots of reviews and shopped around for quite a while before I decided on this set, and I'm glad I did. It has just the right pieces, although I do miss having a 1 qt. pot. The lids fits nicely and are interchangeable with different pieces, so you end up being able to cover all your pieces. It is definitely a good value and you can't go wrong at this price. It's pretty to look at too!"
4,great for a starter stainless cookware set,I've used this set everyday since I received it. The skillet sears my steaks so much better than a non-stick pan! The sides do heat up more than the bottom but that's expected. I think this is great for a starter stainless cookware set.
3,"Overall, good starter set of pans.","For the price, AR, the ensemble was a deal for Stainless Steel cookware. But since then, I have found superior deals for similar quality sets.Overall quality is good, with excellent mirror finishes to assist in low-stick cooking. The more polished the finish, the easier the food release with stainless steel.But the edges of the pans aren't rolled. This can be a big negative to some. It's cheaper construction-wise, but it also damages dishwasher trays' plastic coating.I can only give it 3 stars because my set came with a defective deep fry pan. The bottom aluminum clad layer wasn't attached properly and separate d and bulged upon its first use!Most frustrating. Still haven't heard from Cuisinart about a replacement!:-("
2,Everything sticks no matter how I heat or grease these pans!,"I bought these for my wife for Christmas less than 6 months ago. I thought they were a tremendous deal at the time. However after spending time using these pots and pans we both thoroughly dislike them!We heat them and cook at medium heat per the instructions and we properly oil or butter our pans when using, to no avail.We have to use sponges to clean them because anything else will scratch the surfaces. We found that Barkeeper's Friend works well, but I don't feel that I should be having this sort of issue with these pans."
4,"A good set, but not a great set","I chose this product after some careful consideration.... My final two choices were the Cuisinart and Emeril sets. My wife didn't like the glass tops on the Emeril, so we chose the Cuisinart. They perform very well: cook evenly, heat quickly, have plenty of surface space (the base of the Emeril set is smaller), etc. The only drawback is that the wife finds them difficult to clean. I don't share her opinion; they are probably not as easy to clean as some sets, but I don't see cleaning them as a problem. I would buy the same set again; they are a good set at a good price."
4,Happily surprised ...,"I bought this for the price as well as I really needed some nice cookware. This set turned out to be better than I thought it would be when I purchased it.It's good construction, lighter than I thought, but still cooks wonderfully, cleans up easily, and does look great. My only wish would be thicker handles, but that is my only complaint... I am a guy though, so maybe the handles are perfect for the ladies. This is my only small complaint.My final word..""Great product for a good price!"""
5,Like having nonstick cookware but without the worry....,"Aafter searching for the best rated stainless steel cookware, these were rated the best, after reading the reviews decided to order them.WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!!! They heat so nice and even, cleans up like a dream but did find we have to cook with a lot less heat, it doesn't slow cooking time, just needs lower heat. My husband also enjoys cooking and spending time in the kitchen, we are both pleased with the set and also the dome pan we ordered, great products, easy storage as well.As in some of the other reviews, BarKeepers Friend is a must, will bring that shine back like new, we use SOS on the tougher cleaning as well, but usually a little soak with dishsoap and warm water will loosen most anything up to remove easily. Clean up is a breeze, very pleased.Great price for such a nice set, handles stay cool with stovetop cooking.Easily a 5 star product!!!!"
4,Nice Pans,"These pots are nice and sturdy, but are really made for an electric stove. I have gas and they take forever to get hot. Also I have well water with a softner and the spots are many. I would recommend them to others if they have an electric stove. Shipping was fast and packaged well."
4,Love this set!,"Sturdy, well made...and even cooking temps. I would def recommend this set to anyone. Its a wonderful deal from the money."
4,Cookware Satisfaction,"I have recently purchased a set of Cuisinart Cookware 77-10 and my wife is very please with the product, looks very nice, is easy to clean, and cooks food as advertised. I would recommend this product."
1,A piece of junk! Stay away from it!,I bought this product to replace my non-stick T-Fal set. The skillet is very poorly designed as it burns the food. The fried eggs stick to the bottom of the skillet and then it is very hard to clean. Needs lots of scrubbing which destroys the nice finish of the skillet. I am a professional cook and this is the worst pan I have ever used. Very disappointed with the quality!
2,I thought this was MADE in the USA...,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law because of the good reviews and that it was in the category of ""made in the usa."" When I got the package, I saw underneath the box: ""MADE AND PRINTED IN CHINA."" What the heck?!?!?! Since it didn't have an American flag stamped on the box - I'm pretty sure that it's made in China! My gripe is: WHY IS THIS PRODUCT IN THE CATEGORY OF ""MADE IN THE USA""????!!!! False advertising, that's why I give it 2 stars!"
2,ok,i got them as a gift but i am not a goodcook and have not a days experiance...so i burned most of them and to no return they did not last long in my house. also we are big pasta eaters and having a huge pan that doesns pull out as a strainr sucks big time so i will never buy them again i will buy something super stronge and easy to clean with a strainr pan built in to the pasta pot..they are also very heavy but nice looking
2,Junk,"This particular collection is junk. The first time I used the large fry pan it developed a burn spot and buldge. Cuisinart ""stainless steel"" is softer than a copper pad. Clean it with a copper pad and you'll find scratches. Sauce pans are fine, but the fry pans are junk."
3,Not yet used,"I bought this item as a Christmas Present for my husband so it's still in the original box and will be for another 5 weeks. He likes to cook and is really good so I knew he'd like a good cookware set. Since I can't afford a really good set for hundreds of dollars, this seemed like it would probably work. I didn't want to give it stars yet since I really don't know whether it's any good or not."
3,good starter pots,these pots are great for starting our first home together. they are just enough and vary in sizes enough to get us by until we can get more.
3,"Pretty, but","These pots had such a high rating I thought I'd be so happy with them. They are pretty and have a high shine, which I love. However, you need to use a non-scratch cleaning pad or else they WILL scratch. They also can be used in the oven, and I love that feature too. They heat quickly which is fine, so use medium heat. Just remember to use the non-scratch cleaning pad when cleaning."
4,"pots are great, pans not so much","pots are nice and flat, easy to clean, all good like everyone else said.the pans, things stick on them when frying. i guess i'll go back to the non-stick surfaces. that seems to be the best way to fry anything! why do they even make frying pans with non-stick surfaces?"
5,I love my cookware.,"Replaced an Emerilware nonstick set with this Cuisinart stainless set with much trepidation. I hadn't cooked on anything other than nonstick for YEARS. I am very pleased with my Cuisinart set. I use lower temperatures as instructed, food doesn't stick and clean up is easy (so my husband tells me). Very happy with the set and the price."
4,Inflated compare at price,"The product is fantastic and I love the look of this set; It's something you can proudly display from a pot rack. The surfaces, which are not non-stick, can be a little tricky to get used to at first which is why it only got 4 stars from me. It should be noted, however, that the list price and discount percent are GROSSLY overinflated. Don't get me wrong, this is still a good deal, but only by about $20-$30. Even the Cuisinart website lists these at $149, not $400?? I'd much rather know the reality of the deal I'm getting and not feel as though I have to second guess Amazon's prices."
4,Nice Cookware set...But..,I had to return the first package because one of the saucepan had dent and just got new package. they are all nice and good. it took 20days to get the right one...My friend recommended this set and I like these are not heavy like other stainless cookware set.
2,Discoloration should be considered!!,"I bought this set less than one month ago. When I got the set, it looked shinny. I really liked it. But after I used it one or two times, the color was immediately changed. It looks very old and dirty now. I bought this because of very good reviews here, but I am very disappointed now. Don't buy!"
4,Cuisinate 77-10 Chefs Classic Stainless Steel 10 piece cookware set,"I/My daughter is totally happy with this set of cookware. It has the shine of excellence, does not burn or stick and cleans up easily. I rate it at four, instead of five, only because I was looking for a heavier gauge set. I had thought this to be the quality heavy metal pots/pans and it is very light weight in my opinion. Other than this one complaint I find this set to be everything advertised and more."
5,Very nice cookware,"A gift for my son's birthday. He's the main cook in his family and was still using his cheap old ""bachelor"" pots! He picked out this set for his gift. He loves them! Dishwasher safe. See-through glass lids. It's making me want to buy a set for myself! I'm just wondering when he's gonna invite me over for dinner!"
2,"Please, Please, Please Read the Negative Reviews Too","The set is beautiful to look up, however, after using the 3-Qt saucepan for the 1st time to warm up a soup, during cleaning, I noticed that the bottom of the pot became pitted as if the finish was chipping off. After reading many of the reviews with a lower rating, I learned that the pans are very thin which perhaps caused the chipping. Additionally, the pots stick even at low temperatures using gas. Also, please know that the pots do not clean up easily.[...]"
1,Disappointed--Pots Pitted in Less than a Year,"We are very disappointed with this product. In less than six months, one of the pots started pitting. We sent it in to Cuisinart for a replacement, which in less than six months is also pitting. Now a second pot in the set is pitting too. Cuisinart wants $15 to look at them to be evaluated for a replacement. So, three pitted pots in less than a year. Definitely not acceptable for a set that is supposed to retail for about $400. Also, all Cuisinart products are made in China. If we are going to buy an inferior product, then we would rather it be made in the United States, so that an American worker can have a job and the government can collect some additional income tax. We won't be buying any more Cuisinart cookware."
3,hard to clean,I do like the cookware...my only complaint is that they are hard to clean scorched olive oil out of the pans.
1,Buyer Beware,"If I could rate this cookware a negative five stars, I most certainly would. After only one year of use and careful cleaning, one by one these pans began to RUST from inside the pan! I now only have the large pot for use and unfortunately have seldom use for it.I called the good folks at Cuisinart customer service and informed them how disappointed I was with their inferior product. The response from them was a verbal shrug of the shoulders and sorry we can't refund your $400 purchase or even replace these substandard pots and pans.I would not recommend Cuisinart products to ANYONE!! They simple don't care about their products and neither should you."
3,Okay,"I can't believe that this retailed for $400. I got it for about $115 so I'm okay but it's not the greatest cookware set ever. I went to Costco the other day and found a similar set for like $150 and it was WAY better constructed. This set's bottoms are thinner and the handles get really hot when cooking (this is my problem for realizing that a metal handle will get hot). This set does the job and it's not flimsy, but it's definitely not worth $400. Done again, I would have bought the Costco set for another $35."
3,Very good. Not the easiest to cook with though.,You need to learn to cook with these. They get very hot and will burn easy. They hold up well and look great. Use Barkeepers Friend on them to keep them looking new. It works the best.
2,Cuisinart Stainless cookware,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware SetThese utensils are not what we expected. They are light gauge and heat up to rapidly. Food sticks to them and are difficult to clean.
2,Much cheaper other places,"I received this as a gift since the price was good and the blurb on Amazon said buy new $400.00!! Well, even CuisinartCuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware Setsells it for $149.99 on their website! I've used the 8"" skillet for 3 days and it is so discolored and nothing cleans it. Yes, I have used low temps. I'm so disappointed."
1,Surprised to see so many good reviews,"We had a Caphlon non-stick cookware set that we were happy with, but going on 8 years of use, it was time for something new. We received this set as a Christmas gift, and were excited as stainless steel is supposed to be more durable, and last longer if used correctly. Well, this set is just garbage. We have followed the directions to a t, and yet every single pan after the first use has stains, even just from boiling water! Although cooking on much lower temps and using oils almost everything we cook gets burned and sticks to the bottom of the pans, again leaving marks. The only good thing I have to say about these is that they are much easier to clean than we thought, but sometimes you can't even tell it's cleans because of the marks that get left behind with every use. NEVER AGAIN! Don't waste your money."
1,Dont buy it,"If you are not a professional chef don't buy it. I only used it once and it became yellow. I decided to return it, since after one day of using it, it looked just like my 5 year old cookware."
4,pretty good,"i like these pots and pans. the only reason i gave them a 4/5 is because they turn brown and look ugly after one use. ofcourse i wash them with barkeeper's friend and they look new again but its kind of annoying having to do that after every use. also, my eggs always stick to these pans no matter how low my heat setting or how much oil i utilize. other than that, great product."
5,Great product,This set of pots was a fantastic buy. Super easy to clean and looks fabulous. Great addition to any household.
3,Browning meat = yucky pan,For the most part I am pretty happy with this purchase. The pots are great. They clean up nicely and I don't worry about the safety issues I did with my old Teflon pots. I gave this purchase 3 stars because of the pans. I have used the pans 3 times to brown meat or cook fish and I'm not sure yet if it's operator error or if the pans are lame. The meat stuck to the pan and made clean up hard.
5,Great cookware!,Love this set of cookware! It is so beautiful and cooks very evenly. Cleanup is a breeze and I love it. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to a friend.
4,Good set,"This is a good basic set of stainless cookware. It has met my expectations. It has a heavy and solid feel about it. The handles stay cool when cooking. When cooking eggs in one of the skillets, I used enough oil, but the eggs stuck to the skillet and the clean up was harder than I expected. With a soap and water soak, elbow grease and some bartenders keeper, it is shiny like new. Other than that, I've been very satisfied."
4,great value,"Definitely worth more than the price. Good looking pots and pans. They work really well too, nice weight, even heating etc."
1,Good price but.......,"This set seems to be a really good deal considering the price but after I used the 3 qrt. saucepan for the first time, the coating of the bottom was gone. I see a lot of spots where the coating disappear considering I just boiled a water with a corn on it. Called customer service for a possible replacement but told me to send the product with a $10 dollar check and I have to pay for the shipping charges. Will not recommend to anybody."
5,Cuisinart stainless cookware,"I would recommend this cookware to anyone. Great quality, good price, and delivery was really fast! I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, and she absolutely loves it."
3,Great for a starter set of cookware,"Service and delivery from company was excellent; very fast and professional! The cookware itself is very nice looking coming out of the box, and does do its job correctly as far as heating up the food in it. I only mark it down because it does not clean up well at all. One use, and you can tell the set has been used. Maybe I'm not cleaning it right (kitchen sponge and dishsoap)? Beware: this is not non-stick cookware! I would rate this set as great for a starter set for someone setting up a new home/apartment, but if you LOVE to cook, this is not the set for you."
4,"great product, hard to clean sometimes.",this is a great looking pot and pan set that works well and is relatively easy to clean. i get a few burn spots inside the pot and pans and they are HARD to clean.
1,Nice while it lasts ... which isn't long,"Let's face it ... you get what you pay for, and when someone's selling 10 pieces of stainless cookware for this price, you know they're cutting corners. I used to own a set of this stuff, and was generally pleased with it until the handle on one of the pans came loose after a little over a year of gentle use. If you think this will last as long as your mom's old Revereware, you're out of your mind. I'd rather own a set of battered but solid old pans than cheap junk like this. If you can't afford good stuff (think All-Clad or Calaphon), save your money and look for a bargain on Craigslist."
4,A stailess steel product for the masses,"I really like to cook with steel, although I still prefer cast iron for other recipes. The only problem with this set, a minor one, is that some of the bottoms get a little stained, perhaps the temp of my ceramic burner is too high...Other than that, this is the stuff that the pros use.Highly recommended."
2,Could have paid more attention to negative reviews,"Between the brand name and the reviews here I bought this set. The saute and sauce pans work fine and are good looking. The frying pans - we use a gas range and cannot get the heat low enough not to burn and stick. Doesn't matter what we do, eggs stick and burn, sauteed peppers end up cinders, bacon sticks, and on and on. Of course I bought them to surprise my wife, and of course she had preferred to have some input. Guess who is the goat. So it goes."
3,I like the Cuisinart pots and pans,"I like Cuisinart pots and pans in general. I have a number of pieces that I have bought individually and use them all the time. When my daughter got her own apartment and needed pots and pans I bought her this set. It is a terrific deal. The only problem is that I don't think that the pots and pans in this set are as good or heavy as the ones I have purchased previously on an individual basis. I guess they had to do something to make this set so affordable. For a beginner or for someone who is not a serious cook, this is a really good, complete set, but if you are a serious cook you might want to go with something a little better."
4,Cuisinart cookware,"The cuisinart cookware cooks like any other set of pots and pans I have had. I love the shiny look it has. But it is hard to keep the shine, especially in the frying pans."
5,Great Cookware Set,"We registered for and recieved this cookware set for our wedding April 2005. We fell in love with the quality of this set. The pots heat evenly and don't over heat. Then Hurricane Katrina hit August 2005 taking everything we owned with her. We were devastated and really missed our pots. They originally came from Macy's and we hoped the store would reopen so we could repurchase. It never did. When we bought our second home we really wanted to get these same pots, and Amazon had them. We were so thrilled. This cookware is great. The lids fit really nice, the handles don't get hot at all. Easy to clean and care for too. The best thing about stainless steel is you can use any sort of utensil in them, unlike coated cookware that you have to use plastic or rubber utensils."
1,Very Disappointed!,"Very Disappointed!I've been disappointed with the quality. They are shining and seems good but the pans spot, and also the sides of the sauce pans burn easily.Do not waste money on this cheap cookware."
4,"Look great, cook well, scratch a little easily","Nice set of stainless, especially for the price. Heats evenly, looks fantastic. Use non-metal utensils, because it will scratch a little easily (maybe too easily?), and make sure you get some barkeeper's friend and some microfiber towels for cleaning/polish.If you can afford all clad, of course get it, but if you can't you'll be happy with these."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"The pots and pans were a lot smaller than I thought they'd be, but this is my fault since a 8qt pot is a 8qt pot. It's decent for a family of 4. One of my pots are already stained brown and I cant seem to get it out.I can't believe that more people haven't complained about the handles. Since its stainless steel throughout some heat does transfer to the handles. Just to be safe I wear oven mitts or use a cloth every time I handle then after cooking. Being that the handles are so small it's very hard to pour your food onto a plate. Even with your bare hands you'd have to hold it a specific way to maneuver the pan. The up and down movement is fine, but tilting and rotating gets frustrating.They are pretty. Buy these to hang and decorate your kitchen with. Buy something else if you want to do some real cooking."
2,Look great in the box,"The sauté pans turned a bronze color (no longer shiny stainless steel) and I wrote to custermer service. Instructed to put water in them, heat on stove, then clean. Sorry, I can't go through that every time I cook an egg or use a frying pan. Also, the lids show water spots which actually makes them look dirty. Again, pots are not something I want to polish after use. Very disappointed. Going to toss and get Circulon"
2,Not the quality I expected.,I've had my set for about seven months now. I have pitting in one of my pans which leads me to believe they are not the top quality metal they claim to be. I have a ten year old set of wolfgang puck stainless steel that does not tarnish with every single use like this set does. I literally have to use barkeepers friend on them between each use to prevent sticking. I do not have to do this with my Puck set. I regret purchasing a different more expensive brand from the one that has treated me so well.
5,fantastic cookware,"I've owned this cookware for several years now. I'm really not much of a cook but I wanted some quality cookware and this stuff is definitely it. I had originally purchased a Cusinart stock pot and I was so impressed that I bought this set. I dont remember paying more than $100 for it though (but that was back in 2007).I had always believed the ""you must have non stick cookware"" myth. It is a myth. I cook beef in these things all the time with just a little oil. I sometimes cook beef or a pork roast in the stock pot with the lid off.It works fine.Cleanup is amazingly easy with hot water and a little Dawn -- let that soak and then wipe it out and put in the dishwasher.I'm very glad I bought this set."
5,cuisinart 77 cookware,Love my shiney new cookware. Cooks evenly on my ceramic top stove. Cleans up easily. Lids fit snuggly. Whole set is a pleasure to work with. Highly suggest ordering.
4,Love shiney pans,The ten piece set of Cuisinart pans arrived with shine and bright. Love that look...they work very well...a little stick here and there but the shine is gone...darn. Do I need to scrub a little harder...they are worth it. The weight of the pans seems to be just right...not too heavy but not light.
1,Fake Stainless Steel,My cousin brought this set for my bday in october and within a couple days of using the pots starting to strip and easy to turn when cooking now im looking for a new and better set.I WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. buy yourself a good pot set thats worth a couple of hundred it will worth in the end something you can keep throughout the years.
1,Why oh why did Amazon send me USED cookware,"Well I come home from work today excited to open my supposed NEW Cuisinart 77-10 Chef's Classic Stainless Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set. I see open the box and look inside only to discover the disgusting truth... my pots appear to have been used! Not a single one has the gleaming surface you could see yourself in that I am used to with new stainless cookware. No mirror finish here. Just nasty brown greasy ""stuff"" on the bottom of the pots. I don't know who to blame or what to get next... well the first thing is these are going straight back to Amazon..."
1,Would not buy,"I gave to my daughter as a gift. She has only used 3 of the pans cause everything sticks or burns. She doesnt like at all, I also bought the lasagna pan and stir fry skillet and she wont use any of the others at all Im sorry I bought them at all."
2,Things Stick!,"I have tried to follow the Cuisinart instructions but things like eggs, pancakes, and steaks all stick to the cooking surfaces regardless of heat level and coating with cooking oil. I would not buy this set again. Sorry for the negative review but I am not happy with this purchase. I recently bought other ""non-stick"" skillets to cook things like pancakes..."
3,Cuisinart Pots and Pab set,I purchased this set because it was stainless steel and the pricing was good. I was looking for a set that had the tops of the pots match the tops of the pans. This set has that. But I was also looking for a set where the handles of the lids did not over heat so I am disappointed to say this is not one of them. The handles of the pots and pans stay cool but the handle of the lids get hot. All and all good set for the money. Just wish it had copper bottoms but can't have it all at this price. Beats all other prices I have seen at any stores.
5,Cuisinart 10pc set,"Value for the money, arrived fast, cleans well, ane heavy enough for cookware. I like that lids come with the set and it works well sitting atop an induction interface metal plate. ""Dummy"" here meant to buy an induction set but goofed and did not want the expense of sending it back!"
5,Cuisinart cookware set a bargain!,"Heats evenly, very classically styled, heavy and durable, and - most importantly - food cooks well in it. No sticking with proper use. This was indeed a bargain!"
5,I honestly love this cookware!,"This is without any doubt the finest cookware you can get at the present price. The selection of pans included is ideal for any single individual. These pans heat evenly and clean up beautifully. Thank You Cuisinart, and Thank You Amazon for making these available and affordable."
2,Beautiful set but very difficult to clean.,"I thought I was ready to switch from non-stick to stainless steel pans after reading all of these reviews. The cookware set was beautiful and I was excited to try it. Unfortunately the first dish I cooked was eggs & hashbrowns and even though I followed all of the suggestions (warm the pan, add some oil, etc..) I found it very difficult to cook. Everything stuck to the bottom and it was very difficult to clean- even though I followed the directions and soaked it right away. Also, I think people should know the directions suggest using wooden or plastic utensils- NOT STAINLESS STEEL to avoid scratches. I am going to sell this set and go back to my non-stick."
2,This isn't cuisinart quality,The sides and lids are very thin metal. Not the quality I would expect from Cuisinart. I will say the pots do have a wonderful shine.
3,You get what you pay for,"They are a nice grade of stainless steel, with a nice look and selection of pots and lids in the set. Be aware though that they are only a thin one ply layer of steel. Therfore they have a tendancy to burn the food easly and they wont last more than 2-5 years depending on use. I wish I would have spent a little more to get a 3-5 ply layer of cookware."
1,after 3 years not pleased,I was so excited with the pans when I first bought them (as it came with tons of promises and hype) but after three years of use I'm quiet disappointed. At first I thought it was my fault. I tried to baby the pots as much as I could but nothing worked (I followed the instructions very well). Everything burns when I use them especially the frypans / skillets burns stuff right away. They are very hard to clean (believe me I tried). If you want quality stuff try All Clad or Faberware (if you want something cheaper) but stay away from this set.
5,Top quality pots and pans,"After a couple of months of shopping around for a stainless steel set of pots and pans, I bought the Cuisinart set and could not be happier. Handles are riveted to the pans and are very sturdy and look like the will last forever. These pans do seem to cook a lot hotter than my old set of pans, so watch it the 1st few times you cook with these. The aluminum bottom is very quick to match the heat of the burner, so temp changes seem almost instantaneous. I really could not be happier with this set of pans and the price on Amazon was about half of some local store's sale prices."
5,Great set for price!,"I love this set of pans. Yes, depending on what you cook in them you may see some discoloration on the inside of the pan after diswasher but it comes off with vinegar. Great for the price!"
2,"Everything sticks, very hard to clean","I bought this set after reading the good reviews. They are attractive and still look nice after a year, but they are sooooo hard to clean. They have to be soaked and scrubbed and scrubbed.I've gone back to using my ancient hand-me-down cookware, as it is much easier to deal with."
2,It's alright.,"I am a college student and I love to cook. I also own several Cuisinart kitchen gadget (5.5qt stand mixer, ice cream maker, and White Prep 11 Plus Food Processor). But I'm very disappointed with their REBATE service. It's been almost 5 months but I have not yet received my 8-in Santoku knife. I contacted their customer service and they replied me in 8 days. Anyhoo~ after using the set on daily basis for 5 months:Pros:Affordable price for the whole set (bought mine for $109).Works fine.Cons:Thin-bottomed (so sometimes you gotta watch out, otherwise, it's quite easy to burn and get those brown spots). *also compared to Emeril's Stainless-Steel Cookware, much thinner bottom.No glass lidsWould I buy this product again for the same price?Probably not, I would def. save up more money to get better set."
3,coating is coming out,"I love Cuisinart ...this is my second purchase but this time i am not satisfied with the product as coating came out .i can see tiny black dots on my pots n pan.it came after the first use ,i followed all the instructions from the booklet.I didn't complain as i will ending up sending my stuff which will cost me more than the purchase."
2,Quality not as advertised,"We purchased a Cuisinart 77-10 Stainless Cookware set in late November 2010. After barely one month's use of typical heating of soups, frozen vegitables, etc. black spots showed up on the bottom, and could not be removed. A similiar pot (Onita) had been used in a similiar manner for several years is still like new. This Cuisinart product is obviously of lesser quality. The warranty requires payment of $7 for return shipment plus our shipment costs to return the product. All of this is for them to ""evaluate"" the product. Considering this, it is probably more practical to just purchase a replacement product of another brand."
4,"Great Value, Great Pans","I received these pans for a christmas gift and I love them! They are right when they say they take a little getting used to. The first thing I cooked discolored the inside a little because it was too hot. the instructions say you can get a stainless steel cleaner to take care of it, so I'm looking into it. Overall they are 100 times better then what I had and i think I will have and love for a long time!!!!"
5,Beautiful Set!!!!!,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 10-Piece Cookware SetI am very pleased with my purchase. I ordered this set on 10/24/2007 and received it on 10/25/2007 and didn't even request overnight shipping! The set is beautifully polished and sturdy and I do believe that I will not have to purchase another set of pots for a very long time. Good price for this set! I Definitely Recommend!
4,very nice,"I really enjoy this set of pans. It has been an adjustment to get used to the non-stick for cooking and cleaning, but if you follow the manufacturer's guidelines they are good pans... and very attractive! Note: do not use detergent with lemon."
5,love the set,I received the set within two days. We love it. It is better if the pans have non stick ....
1,another update,"cannot see why there is negative feedback on this set see someone said stains on bottom order bar keepers friend get stains right out for the price these are awesome buy them happy cookingupdate""had two weeks bottom of 10 inch skillet fell off only used twice emailed cuisinart they should replace afraid to use rest of set not good at all.update again 3/1/2012shipped skillet back 16 dollars now they said could tae 4 to 6 weeks to return back never again"
1,Can't stand them,"I've owned these for a few months now. I can't figure out what you can cook with them that doesn't stick like crazy. You can cook on a low temperature with a 1/2"" of oil or butter in the bottom of the frying pans, and yet food still sticks! You may be able to saute some veggies in oil, but forget browning potatoes (they will end up mashed), and don't even try eggs... they are a disaster. I don't want to be an ""artist"", I just want some hot food that I don't have to chisel off the bottom of my pots and pans.Even if you are merely boiling water for mac-n-cheese with the small pots, you better be stirring CONSTANTLY. The noodles in contact with the bottom of the pot will stick fast.There is a reason Teflon was invented. If you like to chisel food off the bottom of your pans when cooking or washing, get these. If you want no-stick, avoid. My $20 Coleman camping cook set does a better job than these."
2,Cuisinart Stainless 10-Piece Cookware Set,Sauces burn the bottom of the pans very easily. You cannot scrub too hard or it will scratch.
3,underwhelming,"I'm used to using an old copper bottomed revereware pot that was a hand me down. I thought this set would be a big step up! The conductivity is far worse. The heat needs to be up much higher, and it still takes much longer to heat up. Cleaning is more difficult, too, though I'm not sure why.My old set is beaten up and scratched, and yet it functions better than this set. I can't return the new set because I've used it, but I am sorry that I bought it.Cheryl"
1,Sauce pans burn on sides,"I bought these because they received good reviews, but I've been disappointed with the quality. The pans spot, and also the sides of the sauce pans burn easily."
2,Bad Reviews,I bought this set because the reviews were so good only to find out that most of them must be from the sellers because anyone who say`s these pans don`t stick is crazy and the clean up if the food sticks is not a breeze. The only good thing about these pans is that they do look nice on the outside. Unfortunately they do stain on the inside after a while. If I had to do over again I would not buy this set.
1,DANGEROUS COOKWARE - BEWARE!!!!,"I was using the Cuisinart 8"" stainless steel skillet found in this set (just sauteing some mushrooms) when of the handle rivets suddenly exploded. The rivet ricocheted off the pan and burned my arm. My wife and I suffered a loss of hearing for about a minute (it was louder than a gunshot!). Hot grease went flying everywhere. We own a relatively low BTU stove (it's no Wolf, that's for sure) and was operating the pan well within the manufacturers recommend temperature range. I have contacted Cuisinart/Conair to replace both the skillet in question and the 2 other skillets in the set (I simply cannot take the risk of it happening again) but they are unwilling to do so. They have been pretty adamant about getting the defective pan back before making a determination as to whether or not they will replace one or all of the skillets. Sounds very suspect to me. This cookware needs to be recalled IMMEDIATELY as it poses a great risk to you and your family."
3,Get's the job done...,"I bought these pans after having a set of Calphalon non-stick. I destroyed the non-stick surface so they needed to be replaced. I'm still adjusting to the new pans... Stuff tends to burn and they don't seem to as evenly but I'm learning to cook at lower temps-- the worst part is that they are IMPOSSIBLE to get clean-looking. Obviously they are harder to wash than the non-stick I was used to, but once you get all the food off, they still look dirty and spotty. I can deal with that. I do prefer the Calphalon set, but wasn't looking to spend as much money this time. One of my favorite features is the helper handle. I'd recommend them but warn that they take some getting used to if you're used to using non-stick pans."
5,Can't be beat (for the price),"When looking for my pot and pan set I didn't see anything in this price range that would compete. I am so happy about the decision I made. They are so sturdy, so well made, and cook so wonderfully. I have no reservations on recommending them for 2x the price I paid. All I would recommend is a stainless steel (non-non-stick) for dummies guide be included. I have a feeling that's where these negative reviews come from. Choose your pan to fit the cooking technique!"
1,Not pleased,"I feel misled by the positive reviews for this product. Not sure what made my experience different than others, but this set has not held up at all. The metal quickly discolored and even flaked off on some pieces. I was pretty terrified when I realized that the little piece of metal that flaked off while cooking probably ended up in my food and therefore in me. About a year in, there are many pieces I don't use because they are in bad shape or simply cannot be cleaned enough to want to cook with."
2,Cracked!,"After less than a year of use, the 3-quart stainless steel sauce pan cracked along side the handle. We're so disappointed. We specifically chose Cuisinart because of its reputation for quality craftsmanship and even heating. Cuisinart provides a limited life-time warranty on this set, but the warranty doesn't allow us to return the set. Only the damaged piece can be returned for repair or replacement at a cost of $7 for return shipping, which the corporation requires be sent as a check or money order with the returned item. The cost of shipping to item to Cuisinart for repair or replacement is an additional cost."
4,Great looking cookware,"I have used my cookware many times since receiving them, and am very pleased. They wash up easily, are sturdy, and nice looking."
5,"Great set, great price","As someone who loves to cook and has been doing it a long time, I am very happy with this set. I have passed up a lot of cookware sets due to pricing, quality or both. I have always been happy with my Cuisinart purchases and decided to take a chance on this set. It's heavy enough to be durable, yet not so heavy as to be hard to handle. It conducts heat nicely and cleans up well, and the pots and pans are perfectly sized. The only thing I would change is the handles - I would either make them wider or larger hollow round handles as to lessen the likelihood of slippage. This is somewhat mitigated by second handles on the larger pots and pans. For the price, this is by far the best set I've seen in a very long time."
5,Great stainless steel pans,I have two sets of these pans. I cook often and I need a set while the other is in the dish washer. They are 100% stainless steel so they can go directly in the oven and under the broiler.
1,not so much,"These pots and pans are dishwasher safe, but everything sticks so your stuck scrubbing by hand -- and a lot!"
5,Awesome set of cookware,"After 50 years of marriage, this is the first complete set of cookware I have purchased. They are really well-made and I am truly enjoying cooking with them."
5,Great pots!,"After 15 years, I needed new cookware because I had one pot remaining from my first set. I came to Amazon, checked out prices and reviews, and decided upon this CuisinArt set. I have used all of the pots, but none of the skillets at this time. I love the post. The pots with the long handles do not get hot when you use them. The stockpot's handles, unfortunately, do get hot. I have also not experienced the lids getting hot, and this pleases me. For the price, this is quality cookware. I am extremely happy with my purchase."
5,Beautiful Cruisnant Cookware,"I purchased these pots and pans for my daughter she was so thrilled to have a set of stainless steel cookware after hearing how teflon can be dangerous to your health. She said ""Mom the cookware is so beautiful""!"
1,Sadly Disappointed,"The amount of the original price listed for this item was bogus. It sated the original price was over $400.00.After 2 uses, the pans have white specks all over the inside of the posts.Do not waste your money!"
2,sticks,"Man, I don't like this. Got a set for my wedding registry and every time i use it i regret that i didnt get another one =(can't fry anything on the frying pans... you need tons of oil, otherwise everything will stick to it... i ruined a couple dishes already... sucks...i gave 2* bc the pots are pretty good. well, there're just regular pots..."
3,neutral,"Love the product but things tend to stick to these pans, so keep your non stick pans but just add these to your kitchen."
2,Slightly unhappy,I think this product looks very nice. When I got it out of the box I was really excited to cook with it. One thing I can say is that it came extremely fast. I ordered and it shipped three hours later. After cooking with the pots and pans I was pretty unhappy. Within just 45 minutes the small sauce pan burned. I attempted to cook eggs the next morning and it stuck all over the pan. I think these are probably good starter dishes while you replace each individual piece with the more expensive models. I'm sorry to say Cuisinart didn't really do very well on these.
4,Nice set,"I was very excited to get this set, I had been looking for awhile for a stainless set that didn't cost a bundle. This set was worth the $129 I paid! It is a bit harder to clean of course than the non-stick pans I used before, but still worth it knowing I am not getting any teflon coating in my food! I think i need to buy some type of different cleaner for them though, I tried to clean one with baking soda and it did the job but scratched the heck out of it, so lesson learned. This is a nice set and I am very happy with it!"
2,not what is on the picture,"Did anybody notice that the pan holding the vegetables is actually not from that set?Why would someone post a photo that actually is not a part of what is advertised, at best, it is unethical."
1,Never!,This rack is a piece of junk. Arms are wide-spread and not suitable for many types of bikes. On many sedans your bike will be too close to the trunk - pedals will cratch the paint. The bikes are also too close to each other. It is a real pain to get two bikes on this rack. NEVER buy it!
3,Does the job,"I got this rack two years ago when I purchased my new road bike.It holds one bike without issue, but two is quite a challenge. I've done it a few times, but only after turning one bike against the other, rotating pedals, and some other machinations. So, I think this is really a one bike carrier with lots of space.That said, it does the job. The strapping is quite secure and the padding adequate for short trips. I take the bike to group rides, so my most challenging experience with this rack is about 10 minutes on the highway.I mount the rack on my Honda Accord sedan. It straps on / off in just a minute. I do notice that the lower level of straps, those below the bike, never do stay secure & usually come undone. If I cinch the strap down so tight that the straps cannot move, that creates a strong vibration noise while driving."
5,conditioning for dance,Great book for all movers. The imagery and descriptions of the exercises are thorough and effective. I teach movement and this book is a must have.
4,Very good,"Excellent resource for dancers, trainers, choreographers, and teachers alike. It contains alot of imagery to assist individuals in attaining correct technique from the start of each dance movement."
4,excellent practise,"Had extreme benefits from reading this book and ending up on a crash course of ballet shortly after, the teacher was using the same techniques and visualisation ideas, which I've found very good all in all. Even without the ballet. Helps to achieve relaxed shoulders and balance (of mind as well)."
1,meaningless mumbo jumbo,"I am in the unfortunate position of having bought 2 books from this author! He seems to have read through a physiology book and is using as many of the big words as he can without apparantly having much understanding about how the body works for example ""imagine the large intestine (the colon) supporting you as you perform a develope""...no thanks!He has meaningless but pretty diagrams with little arrows all over the place, are you really supposed to be able to rotate the 2 sides of your pelvis in opposite directions! The pelvis is stable, that is the whole point of the pelvis.I think if you really want to be well conditioned for dance you need a good teacher. I don't think this book will help."
5,Fantastic!,"I am NOT a dancer. I am just an advanced beginner in Yoga.I'm not sure how I found this book, but I'm more than glad I did. I have chronic lower back pain, and the excercises using balls are very therapeutic.Franklin's use of imagery, his explanations and wonderful drawings of anatomy are simply fantastic.I have found that just reading the book and not doing anything has helped my yoga and my posture. Of course, actually doing the exercises is even better!I would be delighted if Franklin put out a DVD with this kind of material. I have bought many yoga and dance DVDs and the thing I do not like about almost every single one of them is not explaining in any way WHY a certain movement or posture may be beneficial. There's all just mindless work-outs."
4,A good reference,This book is basically very reader-friendly with lots of pictures and descriptions.Most exercises include the use of long therabands
3,There ok,"These glasses in my opinion are just ok.I bought two pairs of original wayfarer's, and I actually liked the cheaper ones.These feel a little cheap on the white plastic, and the lens are a little too dark. Also, the hinges dont have the clicky feel that normal ones have and almost have a plastic hinge feel.If you really want a pair of white wayfarers, then get these, but if you want some better ones then i would go with Classic Wayfarer Style 80's Sunglasses Blues Brothers from Kendal Drive. Those seem like the real Ray-Ban thing.http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Wayfarer-Style-Sunglasses-Brothers/dp/B000OTGY5C/ref=sr_1_2/002-2691207-5688856?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qid;=1183257900&sr;=1-2"
3,Great picture but my old Toshiba SD2109 was better.,I bought this to replace a broken Toshiba SD2109. The picture is great but some of my cds don't play. It's not great on slightly scratched disks which is tough since I rent from netflix. My biggest disappointment was that this unit no longer displays the time remaining on a DVD movie like my old Toshiba. I'm returning it for that reason alone.
3,Misses perfection in an ugly way,"I got this DVD player in the hope that it would replace my current pair of Toshiba SD3750 and Phillips DVD726. See, I wanted to be able to play commercial DVDs, DVD+R, and DVD-R. My SD3750 played DVD+R like a champ and had great ergonomics; the DVD726 had lousy ergonomics (had issues making its remote teach my MX500 too), but read DVD-R just fine. The reviews say this thing can do DVD+/- in addition to doing multi-region and PAL-NTSC conversion on the fly (just like the DVD726 -- another function I wanted), so I picked it up.Good points:It's thinIt's got controls on the front which makes it easy to control it w/o remoteIt's got a decent remote that taught my MX500 without a problem.Bad point:Oh, just one really. When you put a DVD-R in it, it makes a constant and horrible whirring/grinding noise for as long as the disc is in there. It's ... just bad. That kills it for me -- I'll be returning it in the next few days.-roy"
2,Doesn't work using Progressive Scan,"I just bought this and was eagerly wathing Lord of the Rings on our 55"" Philips HDTV using the progressive scan feature. The picture was amazing. WAS...since the progressive scan started to fail. I'm returning this and hoping it was just a defective unit. I had a Toshiba SD-2300 DVD player before and I still love it, we just bought this because the SD-2300 doesn't have progressive scan (it does make a difference in the HDTV)."
4,"A concise, authoritative reference for policy/procedure writers","While there was some confusion in the communication between this new private seller of used products and Amazon, the book actually arrived in a timely manner, was well packaged, and is an excellent resource for policy/procedure writers. The book is concise and authoritative. However, it may be useful for newer policy/planning writers to supplement this book, where this book's information is fleshed-out."
5,Excellent Book on Creating Standard Operating Procedures and Policy Manual,"This books provides concrete guidance for creating a policies and procedures manual. After reading the EMyth Revisited (also an excellent book) I wanted a book that would provide such guidance and this book delivers. A couple of points. First, this book is an overview of the entire process. Some of author's other books in this series take chapters of this book and expand them to book length. I was particularly interested in guidance for writing a standard operating procedures manual, and the book ""7 Steps to Better Written Policies and Procedures"" focuses solely on that topic. Second, despite my focus on the actual written policy/procedures manual, the entire book is excellent, raises points that may be easily overlooked, and I would highly recommend it."
5,blew my mind and my procedures,"This book was absolutely incredible. Mr. Page is a God of procedures and policies. I write policies and procedures for a company that writes policies and procedures for improving other companies policies and procedures. He writes so clear and concise and concise and clearly, about policies and procedures and policies about precedures and vice versa, that my policies and procedures improved to become better policies and procedures about policies and procedures and...phew, got a little excited! thanks dr. P, you have a true gift from god. Some people are good at writing about policies, and some about procedures, but you're a double threat. You're like the bo jackson of policies and procedures. Keep up the great work, and i look forward to the sequel, cuz I want to buy the box set! snort! ;)"
1,Kindle download comes without table of contents or index!,"So, this could well be user error. However, I just downloaded this book electronically (Kindle for PC) so that I could use it immediately (I'm in the middle of writing a proposal). Unfortunately, it arrived without a table of contents. This is extremely disappointing since I now have no real way to leverage it as a how-to/reference. The book itself seems like a great resource. I just don't have time or the need to read it cover to cover."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","I think this is a wonderful book. I have read some of those other reviews and I believe that they are entirely wrong. This is a simple book, yes, but that is what I need. It is easy to understand and easy to apply. I tend to believe that the bashers are really competitors. Just an opinion of mine. Thanks Steve Page for this great book. I am buying 10 more for my team.Sam"
1,Neither particularly sexy nor interesting,"I found this tale to read as an insult to the legitimate world ofphone-sex workers, which might be forgiveable if it was at leastsexy. But the main character is constantly shocked and ready to vomit all the time, which is not exactly my idea of the erotic.The plot is absurd -- the police work resembles nothing in real life; the idea of a fourteen year old child being hurt (burned with a cigarette during sex) is repeated over and over as though this could make it erotic; and men come off as pretty unattractive human beings.Overall, quite a disappointment.Read ""Vox."" Or a good mystery novel."
2,Amateur Writer,"After reading this book, it is no wonder that I am now learning that it was self-published! There is a great story line here but has not been developed enough. I felt that the author was trying to write a lascivious novel while not being pornographic. It was not only poorly written but the book was filled with grammatical errors throughout. I give it two stars only because of the plot."
4,Great Character Development,"This is a great book. The author brings the main charactersalive, while exposing the reader to the odd world of phone sex. I'ddescribe this novel as an erotic read, but also an in-depth portrayal of a woman who is unsatisfied with her life, which finds her dabbling in exciting and dangerous risk-taking. Call me gullible, but there was a plot twist included that I didn't see coming! Well done."
2,M. J. Rose does Grace Metalious one better!,"Are you looking for a little hot bedtime reading? Then you've come to the right place if you are looking at M. J. Rose's 'Lip Service'. Good reading, hot action, but without the pornography.M. J. Rose goes into lots of minorly titillating details - maybe even too much at times, but don't let that discourage you. This particular trek through the written word is worth your trouble."
3,OK,It was OK. I was disappointed with the ending. It was quite the let down. I am not sure I would recommend the book
2,disappointed,"An earlier work from an intriguing author. Storyline was weak and the characters had no depth. If you want fluff, the price is right. Fans of her later work will not enjoy this book."
1,STOP HER BEFORE SHE WRITES AGAIN,"Not sexy, not a thriller, not readable. In short, no redeeming features and a thorough waste of paper. Possibly the worst aspect: the cover image and jacket blurb. Shameless promotion of a shallow and self-involved lifestyle - Martha Stewart with a BA in psychology. The ""story"" was weak, flawed and thin. Spare yourself - this book is almost as sexy as cancer of the colon. Come on folks - read some REAL fiction."
5,Sensitive subject written about with compassion,"In Lip Service, MJ Rose has written about a sensitive subject with compassion and understanding. Her characters are realistic, quietly playing out the charades they feel there is no escaping from. It is troubling...yet riveting...a real page turner, holding the reader in it's gentle grasp, as we hope for a happy ending to such a tragic, hopeless situation."
5,A guilty pleasure!,"Outstanding book, engrossing, a classic! Inspiring, delicious, erotic and full of inhibition, ""Lip Service"" is a pillow book for the '90s. The writing is flawless and easily flows without interruption. Read it in the privacy of your home, if the puritanical type. Otherwise, take this book to a cafe or into the office lunch room and revel in its naughty revelations. Don't be surprised if this book fills your cheeks with color and makes you glance around to look at other people in a differen way. ""Lip Service"" is a guilty pleasure to read - share it with your girlfriends."
2,"Misleading hype, boring story","Okay, the sexy parts of this book were...sexy. Unfortunately, the hype leads you to believe that there will be a lot more of the moaning and sighing than there is.There's lots of kvetching though. Julia is a poor little pampered professional wife, with nothing more on her mind than her boredom with hubby, her hots for two different guys in her life, her phone sex research, and the mean old building that will soon block out her precious orchids' sunlight.The most annoying thing of all is that midway through this book, it switches gears into an attempt at a suspense thriller, when Julia starts getting super-creepy calls and the police won't take her seriously. Cuz, you know, BAD THINGS always happen to naughty girls who do things like talk dirty on the phone.This book wants to be new and naughty but it ends up being tired and trite."
4,Fascinating,"This novel offers a fascinating view into the world of phone sex. The believable heroine does not anticipate how becoming a telephone sex therapist will force her to confront some of her own sexual issues, blowing apart her carefully constructed world. The book is fun to read and hard to put down."
1,Dumb beyond belief,"How could a book with so many dirty words be so boring? How could this author take such an interesting premise (secret phone sex) and turn it into such a dumb plot? Why not read a detective book or two before writing this and learn something about the real world? Anybody who muttered Erica Jong or any other serious writer's name in comparison with this must be joking. I wish I'd read the reviews here before I bought this -- all the five star ones read like advertising hype, and the one star reviews read like real readers wrote them."
1,not worth rating,"I don't mean to be impolite,and I lavish praise where it is deserved, but this book wouldn't pass third grade special education. I rated it one star because there are no zeros. Most people could write something better than this on their lunch hour. The writing is worse than sophmoric, the characters are wooden and one dimensional (especially the husband) and the story is childish. I'm not a writer but I'm sure there are many, many authors out there with much better manuscripts than this that will never see print. So why this one? What a complete waste of time."
4,"A thought-provoking, compelling story!","Julia Sterling would seem to have it all. She and her husband are the perfect team, raising money for his non-profit foundation for Fathers In Trouble. They move among the elite, working closely together. When a writing job leads Julia to train as a phone sex operator, the illusions are shredded one by one - and she is left to confront herself at the most basic level. Without the props she's used for years, what will she find? LIP SERVICE is the story of one woman's journey of self-discovery, using her awakening sexual realization to highlight every area of her life. Ms. Rose has crafted a thought-provoking, compelling story that will mark you with the need to reconsider your own 'self'."
4,A better read than airport novels,Lip Service is racier than a Jackie Collins' novel but still contains an intelligent plot that stops it from crossing the line into smut. It was a better read than many of the trashy novels I've picked up in beach houses and airports.
4,pleasantly surprised,"When this book was recommended to me I hesitated, erotica not being my genre of choice. But I am glad I was pursuaded to give it a try. It was a great read. I was drawn into the story quickly and found the plot to be much more intriguing than I expected (admittedly expecting a Danielle Steelesque fluff).Give it a try, it's worth it."
5,A great suprise! A fun read that makes you think twice...,"Lip Service took me totally by suprise. Billed as erotica with a twist, M.J. Rose isn't just trying to make things steamy -- she delivers insights about men, marriage and relationships that is bound to ring true for a great many readers."
5,A great read!!,"I very much enjoyed this book! So much so, that in 1 1/2 days I had it read! I especially related to Julia and her exploration of her sexuality. Women bury their sexual side too deep and this book shows, that with some imagination, all things are possible"
5,Move over Ayn Rand...,"Not since ""Atlas Shrugged"" has a book had the power to become such an instant classic. Rose has spun a modern tale of triumph and suspense that will forever ring true over the timeless hills of feminine bravura."
4,An entertainig human drama,"LIP SERVICE is an entertaining human drama that centers on suddenly seeking Julia for herself. The story line is intriguing, but readers need to realize that there are profanity and detailed descriptions of sex within the book (Duh! That should surprise no one as the book uses phone sex as a device.) However, that is not the theme of the tale. Instead the novel is all about Julia trying to find an identity that will allow her to fully flourish. M.J. Rose succeeds in doing this difficult accomplishment even as readers will want to offer cheese to the whining Julia, who provides no reason to support her assertion that her life is kind of a drag."
2,A disappointment,"This book is way over-hyped here. Basic romance- writing, cliched sex-scenes, stereotypical characters, unbelievable plot. Not worth the time or money."
2,Not worth your time,"This book could have been pretty good, but I felt the phone sex scenes were too explicit and close to what I would label pornography. It was predictable and sterotypical.The author's editor did not do their job. It felt like a first draft."
4,A thought-provoking book,"Lip Service is a book that will make every woman think twice about how satisfying her own marriage really is. From the outside, Julia appeared to have everything she could possibly want in life, including a handsome husband who really cared for her--or thought he did. But what did she really want from her marriage? When Julia began to research a book about other people's sexual yearnings, she started to think seriously her own wants and needs. Lip Service is a sexually frank look at marriage, but the book makes it clear that there is a lot more to marriage than sex."
3,Not so great...,"This is a 100% cotton hoody. The add claims its ""fleece"" which is not. So, i call that false advertisement."
4,Easy to use for a newbie,"I've never had a multimeter before and I needed one to test a part on an old laser printer I had. I purchased this model and had it out of the package and testing the parts I needed in about 2 or 3 minutes. It worked well, was easy to use and I would easily recommend it to anyone who needs a simple multimeter that still has a large scope of tests that it can perform."
1,Very disappointed,"I agree with the other reviewer - of all the things that my children got for Christmas, this was absolutely the toughest to open. When I finally did it get it set up, I was very disappointed. The separate stages that are supposed to spin around have to be done via a ""roller ball"" underneath. I can't get the girl to dance to the music. I put new batteries in but that didn't help. There is a button on the stand she stands on, but when that is pressed, all she does is shake her hips a little, but definitely not to the music, and not on her own. My daughter loves it because it is her first Bratz product but I do not recommend this product."
4,Bratz Baby,"Honestly my daughter hasn't played with this yet solely because Christmas has yet to come; however I do believe she will throughly enjoy it's play time. I don't necessarily believe the sounds/doll movement/lights are that grand however I believe the concept of the toy is great. My daughter rarely enjoys the toys that are over the top in effects therefore it will probably not bother her that there is no real karaoke adventure with this toy beyond what she can possibly conjure up within her own imagination. I like the toy thus far...a bit dusty though but what can I expect it's over 4 years old. It is brand new however completely sealed in box. BTW the opening of the toy isn't that difficult compared to any other toy that is sealed in a package. I had the help of a box cut razor (warehouse thingy and i may just have the name wrong) and scissors which made the process much easier. All and all great product for imagination and pretend play just don't expect to much for the ""extras""."
3,I'll let you know when I finally get the thing open!,"It's the day after Christmas and I'm still on the floor trying to get the packaging off the blasted thing. Ten minutes into the unpacking expedition, I resorted to the use of electric hedge trimmers and sharp-nosed pliers. I was literally sweating while gouging at any stray piece of plastic that looked like it could be cut, or ripping the skin off of my fingers trying to undo one of those twisty things, made from steel. Man! They really make it tough. Maybe some of us dads and moms can write letters to the manufactures regarding giving us a break."
2,Awesome,IT IS REALLY FUN TO GO TO YOUR PARENTS AND SAY HERE MOM AND DAD HAVE GUM:) BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It Is Really Cool To Your Teachers and Kids And Yeahhh
2,Shocking Gum,The toy was a hit with my son but it didn't last long. The shocking part was strong at first and then after the 3rd day it fadded. The kids loved it but wish it lasted a bit longer than that.I would purchase another one though just because my son loved it.
5,Besa ceiling light,"This is a beautiful light. The fact that it has three bulbs really makes a big difference in my town house kitchen. I am not sure how easy it will be to change the light bulbs by myself because it is a big light, but my bulbs should last a year so I am not worried about it. I would rather have help than not have installed this beautiful light."
5,Best soap ever,"I have used Pear soap for years now, but find it very hard to find in my local area now so I ordered online which was great! If you have sensitive skin this is the best soap ever!!!!"
1,check it out for yourselves. This soap has gone DOWNHILL.,"After reading all the reviews, specifically the ones that say it smells way different and is a different formula, I decided to look for myself. Wikipedia really spells out a lot of what is going on with this soap. Up until just a few years ago they have had the same formula from 1789 all the way up to 2003. Then they started changing it. It started being made in India. they started using alcohol and a whole list of other ingredients. Look for yourself: [...]I won't be buying any. I used to love this soap. But I'm not going to even try it now that the formula has changed. I'll stick with Basis or Sebamed.basis Sensitive Skin Bar, Cleans + Soothes, 4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)Sebamed Soap-free Cleansing Bar, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)"
1,shameful new formula,original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients. Now it has 24!it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting. I urge you to research this product before buying. I learned the hard way. It is not what you have fond memories of. Very disappointing.it irritated my eyes and nose. i could even taste it. AVOID.
2,Original high quality standart & tradition destroyed,It's a pity that unilever destroyed the 200 year old tradition. The soap now smells like a petrol derivate or similar. I ordered 98 bars to make nice gifts to friends but now this would be just embarassing...
1,Is this really PEARS?,"I ordered this PEARS soap because I have always loved the smell more than anything. I've used this soap for like 30 years. When it came and I opened it and used it, the smell was not the usual, but way more like a bad chemical smell. Apparently, the PEARS company was sold to another and the same old soap with the wonderful smell is no longer in production. So sad."
1,smelly soap,I have purchased this product for many years. Will not purchase again. Not at all the same quality. Its a shame they can change and totally ruin a good soap.
