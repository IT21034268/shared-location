3,It was okay,"I bought the book cause I love the movie adaptation. Its funny normally the book has so much more than the film but in this case the movie in my opinion was so much better than the book. The book is set in the 50's, its very clean The book was nice very clean dated in the 50's so I suppose it has to be but I didn't feel the chemistry between the two main characters so I was really disappointed."
2,just okay,"I must admit that this book was a page-turner, but I must also admit that I found it trite and schmaltzy. Sparks is a mediocre writer."
3,Least of Sparks,"Of his three books thus far, I found this to be the one I least recommend. The story is touching, but not really ""believable"" enough to capture me emotionally. I still would recommend reading it if you are a Sparks fan, but of the three, it comes in last place."
2,"Sweet, but not too deep","This book is very sweet but is predictable and superficial. A nice story, but don't look to this for any deep life lessons."
1,Revolting Drivel,"I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, ""romance lite"" books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this vapid fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it. We can do better than this, American readers!"
1,A Walk To Remember,"I picked up the book hoping it would be yet another breathtaking novel from Nicholas Sparks-it was not...I dragged myself through this seemingly endless novel about young love interrupted by life...The plot itself is good (the preacher's daughter has cancer and is in love) but the delivery is completely wrong...There were so many cliches and boring metaphorical virtues in it that it was like going to church, and for once, I wished I was the one who had cancer."
1,Contrived and predictable,"I have read Nicholas Sparks ""Message in the Bottle"" and ""The Notebook"" and thoroughly enjoyed them. When I picked up ""A Walk to Remember"" I was immediately intrigued. This time my version was the talking book type. I popped the cassette into my car stereo and after only a few minutes, the mood was set. I immediately began to dislike this book. Mistake number one was that it was read by the author, in monotone, who obviously has no professional broadcasting or acting training. I tried to get past that and really listened to the story. I couldn't believe how contrived and predictable it was. This is the sappiest book I have ever read. I took a sudden dislike to wimpy Landon Carter and the unbelievably geeky Jamie. There is so much wrong with this book that it makes me afraid to read the author's next novel. If I do get over the fact that this book was a waste of my time and venture to read any more of this man's work, I will be sure to proceed with caution."
4,A Walk to Remember,"Although this book was predictable, it was also very inspiring. The end was sad, but it also made you smile, because of all the heart-warming events that occured. I recomended this book to many of my friends, and hope you enjoy the book. It's fast to read, and very good. Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful!,"A Walk to Remember has to be one of the best books that I've ever read. I read it in only one sitting, I couldn't put it down. I want to believe that Jamie did make it, but I'm not so sure. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Nicholas Sparks, when will your next book be out?"
4,good...,"it is a great sad book but there isnt really a climax it just keeps going until the ""big"" part happens but it is deffenetly worth reading"
3,"Schmaltz, but maybe good practice for EFL readers","This book is both easy to read and simplistic, thickly sentimental, and full of clich√©. It was engaging enough for me to finish it, but I don't expect I'll actively seek out any more Sparks books.I would, however, recommend this book to English language learners as supplementary leisure reading. One of its big strengths is the wealth of information it offers on US culture in the 1950s. Vocabulary and grammar won't present much of a problem - there probably isn't a single word you'll have to look up. And from a teacher's point of view, there isn't much in this book that could possibly be offensive, unless one is strongly averse to Christianity - or kitsch."
5,I was not disappointed...,"Once again, Nicholas Sparks provided a book that I had to finish in one sitting. I eagerly anticipated his newest release, and I was not disappointed. As with his other two books, ""A Walk to Remember"" also evoked a rollar-coaster of emotions (especially the tears!). This is a very sweet and innocent ""coming of age"" story that I absolutely loved and will recommend to others to read. I can't wait for Sparks to release his next book!"
3,Not as good as the last two...,"Still worthy of sitting down and enjoying it in one, uninterrupted sitting, though. Unlike The Notebook or Message in a Bottle, the path is clear throughout the book. Not as long, not as well developed, but still an enjoyable escape."
1,Ugh!,"I read this for a book group, and we generally agreed that it was terrible. Not Sparks' best work, emotionally manipulative, and not even very well written. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a brick on a 3-layer chocolate cake. On a more personal note, I myself could do with a lot less god in a novel, and a whole lot less deus ex machina. If you're the kind of person who gleefully embraces the kind of emotional manipulation that characterizes both Hallmark TV Movies and Hallmark commercials, then this is right for you. Otherwise, it's a good one to skip entirely. I give it 1 star because you can read it in less than 3 hours if you're a fast reader, so at least the agony is over soon."
2,A highly predictable book,"This is the first book I read by Nicholas Spark, after hearing many good reviews, and many translation of his work to movie screen. I pick this as the first book because of its size, a bit longer than 200 pages, so that I can finish it in 2 days.I must say I am disappointed (not a bit, but quite a lot). Not only the plot was HIGHLY predictable, I don't think it is good on character development.In Hong Kong, such similar themes have been repeated in the movies in the 50-60s . About 10 years ago, we had a movie called ""C'est La Vie Mon Cherie"" with similar theme, but with a much much much moving plot, much much much better characters. The female lead earned a best female actress award in the HK Movie Acadamy Award.I know this review may piss some of the fans of the author, but I will keep on reading one or two more of his books to see whether I can change my mind."
1,Tacky sentimental ...!!!!,"This is one of the worst books i've had the misfortune of reading. It is your run of the mill oprah book club type books where two totally incompatible people fall in love against the odds, and then one dies of cancer. Could it be any more predictable. A truly original ending would have had Jaime turn out to be a cyborg. Just because a book is on the New York Times Bestseller list doesn't mean its a great literary work. Get a clue you Lemmings! Go read Hamlet, Pride and Prejudice is a romance novel but at it was well written. For a great novel that has romance, passion and tragedy try Anna Karenina! I only gave this book one star because zero wasn't an option."
5,Wonderful book!,"This book was so beautifully written. I enjoyed every minute. I have never ever cried over a book before, and anything that can make me cry like that has to be good! Its the best book I have read, and I definetly recommend it to anyone of any age. Its lovely, and there is something we can all learn from it...when you find your true love, it will last forever!!!!"
2,"I liked it better when it was called ""Love Story.""","It had the same plot as ""Love Story"" complete with the required boy-falls-in-love-with-girl-from-opposite-end-of-the-social-structure and the required resistance of someone's father and, of course, the required terminal illness. But other than different names, times, places and settings, it was the same book. And I'm wondering -- is this allowed? I think most of the readers of this books are too young to remember ""Love Story"" but now that the movie is out, won't the public catch on and blow the whistle about this obvious rewrite?"
1,Love Story Revisited,"If there is a more sappy story out there, I would be surprised. This is definitely not a book for adult readers. Mr. Sparks obviously read that 70's tear-jerker, Love Story, added a dose of the South, sprinkled in a little nostalgia for the 50's and came up with pablum in book form. Yuk!"
5,One of the best books I have read,"I am 15 years old, and I am not really into reading. I happened to pick this book, and read it. This book was absoulutly with out a doubt, the best book I have ever read. This book is especially great for teenagers, and shows what we go through sort of. I would recomend this book to anyone, young or old!"
2,Sappy summer read,"This is a good book to pick up if you're on your way to a long plane flight, a week of sunning on the beach, or an extended time on the throne. It's a fairly quick read, with no deep concepts to grasp or difficult vocabulary. (Which sometimes, I must admit, is exactly what I need. Kind-of like the book version of the musical CATS.)If you want to ponder something, though, and figure it out, and wonder what the characters might do next, don't pick this book up. I'd say it's strictly lazy summer reading."
4,A Walk to Remember,I would recommend this book to anyone. If you have seen the movie you need to read the book. I liked watching the movie first because I could compare the differences between the two. The book has taught me to treat everyone you meet with respect. I have also learned to treat others the way you wish to be treated. I could relate too the book well. Some of the things the main characters had to face I have been faced with before in my own life. A Walk to Remember is an all out great book. I give it two thumbs up.
2,The movie is better,"Ok,the book is alright. But the Movie is way better,I fell in love with the characters in the movie but I couldn't get into the book. It was good but the movie is one of my very favorites and the book didn't even come close."
4,Sparks Delivers!,"This is an amble you'll not soon forget. Often touching, sometimes deeply poignant, this book seemed to speak to my soul. The easy cadence of the words as Nicolas Sparks reminisced was captivating. The characters were well fleshed out in my minds eye as the story progressed and a boy grew into a man. This book may cause you to re-examine some of your own pre-conceptions about people who are `different'. Recommended!"
5,A Walk to Remeber,This is one of my favorite books. I've read it 2 times already but I intend to read it many many more times. The tragic love story was awsome. By the time I finished reading it I couldn't stop crying. I give it five stars I sawit in the theaters 3 times. I intend to get it on DVD and VHS for the special features. For the people that thought it was a bad movie I think they are crazy. It is the best book and movie I've ever seen.
5,Incredible!,"WOW!I was in complete and utter shock, and I thought the movie was good- This is NOTHING compared to the movie, it has a mix of everything for PICKY readers. WARNING you will need to keep a box of tissue nearby! I was blown away at how descripitive ""Sparks"" was upon writing this book, it makes u belive in faith, love, belief, tragedy, and how dreams do actually come true!"
5,Touching...It Will Make You Cry,"This book is one my favorite books that I have read. After seeing the movie starring Mandy Moore and Shane West I begged my mother to take me to purchase the book. This is must for any book fan who doesn't mind a tear-jerking story. I slightly wish I had discovered the book before the movie, because I found my self skimming it at parts because of my knowledge of the movie. I recommend reading the book before seeing it. Other than that, I loved this book and finished it in 2 days. Read this book!"
4,"Not a top literary pick, but a good quick read.","One of the previous reviewers called this a ""chick book"". I would have to agree - and I am a ""chick""! I wouldn't recommend this book to a guy (hate to say it, but true). I also wouldn't expect To Kill a Mockingbird...The book is a quick read (I read it in about 6 hours). The reading is easy, somewhere along the Harry Potter books. It's a nice story about a small-town popular boy falling for the preacher's daughter. She's got a secret that we don't find out about until the end of the book (though, I have to say I had guessed her ""secret"" the first time Sparks mentions that the girl has a secret).I think this would be a GREAT book for a teenager or someone in their young 20s - someone who is looking for answers. For me, it didn't evoke many strong emotions, but would have had I read it when I was in my 20s."
5,Very Touching story,This is one of the saddest and most touching books i have ever read i love it it made me cry at the end i truly loved it everyone should read it!!!
3,Not as Good as the Movie,"A Walk to Remember is one of my favorite movies, so I was excited to read the book. I love to read Nicholas Sparks, and have read a lot of his books. I was really surprised to find that there are a lot of differences between the movie and the book. In the movie, there is no mention of an orphanage, but in the book that is a big part of the story. The book was okay, but I prefer the movie. It was a short book, so I guess they had to add a lot of things to make it into a movie. Maybe if I had read the book first, and then seen the movie, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Usually movies that are written from books follow the story line and characters pretty well. Unfortunately this one did not."
3,Good Book,This is a good book of Nicholas Sparks. I do actually like the movie slightly better than the book though.
2,Not Worth Remembering,"I did not care for this book - it wasn't the worst book I have ever read, but it didn't even come close to being ""good"". I cannot believe it got so many 5 star ratings. It was so predictable, I basically knew how it was going to end by the 4th chapter. I immediately caught onto the little ""hints"" the author was dropping that Jamie was not well.I felt like I was reading a novel written by a 16 year old. By the end of the book I was so sick of Landon saying ""if you know what I mean"" that I could scream! This story was supposed to be happening through the eyes of a 50 something year old man - how many older men do you know that says ""if you know what I mean"" after every other statement. Give me a break. It was torture to read that over and over...."
1,"Life,s Journey","Good book. VERY short. A lot of life stories involve, love, forgiveness, patience, and finding the meaning of life.Nicholas Sparks is an excellent writer."
3,This is an ok book at best,"This is an ok book, not great but also not awful. Its a quick read which is good because if it was any longer I would have hated it.Im not really sure what so many people like about Nicholas Sparks' books, they are predicatable, sappy and a little boring. There must be a lot of young girls reading them.This story wont hold any surprises and you wont cry very much if at all like it warns you in the beginnnig. I read this while I was pregnant and very emotional and it only made me mildly watery eyed.That said its still not a bad book. Just not a great one."
5,A Walk to Remember,"After reading Mr Sparks other two novels, ""The Notebook"" and ""Message in a Bottle"", which I truly loved, I literally ran to the book store when A Walk to Remember first came out. everything about this book is compelling. the Characters, the story line and pace of the book. I dont normally cry at movies or books but I have cried at virtually every thing that Mr Sparks has written! There are those that put his work down for being to""sappy"". But I find his work refreshing and honest and I'm not afraid to give this to anyone to read because there is no profanity or sex or violence. Thank you Mr Sparks for another great romance!"
4,A Walk to Remember,I am 63 years of age and I awoke my wife with my weeping. I can not say enough god things about this book. I am sure all who read it will be touched. If they are not-- shame on them.
4,Wonderful Story,"Landon needs a date for the dance. Everyone is taken except the Baptist Minister's daughter, Jamie. Jamie was always kind of the ""loner"" type of girl. Landon swallows his pride and asks her to the dance. Soon him and Jamie start dating. Then the find out Jamie has leukemia. Slowly she gets weaker and weaker. Landon knows time is running out for Jamie. Then he discovers there is something he must do before her time it up.Wonderful book, a great classic love story."
4,the last 60 pages made the entire book worth reading,"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books. I have enjoyed all of them, so I was very hopeful and excited about this book. The first couple of paragraphs caught my attention, but then the story got somewhat dull. Just when I thought the pace of the story would never speed up, the plot exploded with suprises and heart-wrenching details. I absolutely adored the ending, which left a question in your mind to what really happened to Jamie. The book definitely gave my heart a good 2 hours of warmth. An easy read."
5,A Book to Remember,"This book is the best book I have ever read! I do not like reading much but I have to for school. One day I was in class and a friend was talking about it and I decided to give it a try. After reading a few chapters, I could not put it down. I now encourage everyone to read this book. This story is about a teenage boy named Landon, who has to do a play with the preacher's daughter. The preacher's daughter, named Julie, is not only the most unpopular girl she is very different and has many different ways.While doing the play together they grow closer. After this they get some news that puts a new meaning in their lives. This book is a basket full of emotions. The characters are well developed and you know their thoughts, which puts you in their shoes. The title fits in with the story at the end that ties it all together. I encourage everyone who is ready to take a trip down the emotional road, read this one!"
4,Book in satisfactory condition,"The book was not in as good of condition as the seller described, but satisfactory."
4,What am I missing here?,"I recently purchased the book ""A Walk to Remember"" from a book club that sells Christian based literature. To my surprise, the book had a disclaimer on the front dust cover that said it was a version of the book I had thought I had purchased. I have read this version, and do not feel there are any holes in the fabric. But just what am I missing with this version, anyway?"
1,Yuck,This was one of the worst books I have ever read. There was no story line and brain power was not required while reading this. I still can't believe they made it into a movie.
1,Rather disappointing,"I'd never read anything by Sparks before, and must say I'm not terribly impressed. The plot was extremely predictable, the characters unrealistic and pigeonholed, and the writing style lazy. On a positive note: the cover was pretty."
1,"Great, but the code is dated","Simply put, this book was published in 2005. That's over four years ago now, so the code will not compile. At all.I highly recommend it if you're looking for a book that will give you examples that you have to fix, otherwise if you're no good at debugging then save yourself the trouble of buying it."
1,Try a different book!,"Although I have looked to this book for answers many times, it rarely if ever comes through with the info I need. This book fails to give the reader/ game designer the conceptual info to fill in the blanks of their own personal issues with their own game ideas.I found the info in here to be scattered and poorly organized, and utterly useless in terms of ""back-bone"" game programming basics. I have taken game prototyping classes using Flash and this book was useless. Unless you plan to build the most basic games, exactly as they are presented in this book, you will find very little info in here to help you on your more creative and ambitious game projects."
3,What you don't know can hurt you...,"I have no complaints about the book itself; I didn't get far enough into it to comment either way, but it does appear to be very well written and complete.A friend ordered this book about the same time I did, and we were both shocked to find out that we needed Flash MX 2004. I suppose we should have assumed that, but nowhere was it mentioned in any of the descriptions or reviews on this or any other site. I ended up returning the book because I can't afford the program right now.So if you don't already have Flash MX 2004, check the price before deciding to buy this book."
5,Great for Beginners. Highly recommended,"I bought about 4 books about getting started in flash and gaming, and this one was far and away the best. Great examples, step by step walkthroughs. I actually still use some of the examples as referece in creating new games.Highly recommended for beginners."
4,A solid foundation,"Upon buying this book, I had dreamed of being able to write powerful flash games. Although I felt that there was more to be desired form the areas involving actionscript, overall I felt that that it delivered exactly what it promised; a strong introduction to flash game ""programming."""
5,"Review of ""Beginning Flash Game Programming for DUMMIES""",Great buy. Very easy to read and understand.Only problems are a few typos iv found in the code examples he gives. Nothing major and by the time you find them you know what it should say.Its exacly what I was looking for to help me start making Flash games.
5,Excellent work!,"This is a very well written book as it doesn't just drag you by the hand through a bunch of unexplained concepts but rather, gives you a solid useable understanding of how things work. Very good work."
1,Worst Book Ever,"I spent hours pouring over this book, but honesty, none of the coding worked. Perhaps the book would be better for someone who already has a good deal of Flash programming experience, but this is definitely NOT for beginners. The instructions are vague and non-specific. Unfortunately, I bought this as an ebook, otherwise I would have returned it. If I could have given it zero stars, I would."
4,Mostly brilliant,"This writer ought to be read by a vast audience. Her stories are gripping accounts of lives lived on the edge of sanity or reason. The story ""Let Them Call It Jazz"" is worth the price alone. Read it and weep."
3,silicone glove,"I like the way the glove fits and the separate index finger makes it easy to pick up things. But.....when removing an item from the oven, the glove does not adequately protect my hand from heat."
1,Bad Purchase,I purchased this item to find out heat transfer is really a problem. It makes gripping anything securily dificult. I do not recommend this product
5,Great movie about before the flood!,"Ever imagine what the Garden of Eden was like? Dr Hovind's vivid descriptions will intrigue your imagination! The Garden of Eden, part two of the seminar series, describes the earth as it was before the worldwide flood. Dr. Hovind explains in detail how it was possible for man to live over 900 years, for plants and animals to grow much larger than today, and for dinosaurs to thrive along with man."
5,Fit like custom made!,"Aura Dark Blue Regular Rise Stretch JeanBecause I am long-legged, long waisted and have ""curves"", I have always had problems finding women's jeans to fit me. These jeans fit like they were custom-made, just for me! There is just enough stretch so you can bend or sit comfortably. The ultimate test was a 14-hour flight, at the end of which, the jeans looked like I had just put them on and I felt like it too... no embedded wrinkles in my body from binding clothing!!! In fact, I am going to buy another pair as soon as I finish this review! Any questions??? lol"
2,Tired of hemming these jeans,"I've worn these jeans for several years, through several sizes. But the ""short"" length at 30 inches is too long for my 5'4"", even with heels.I'll be looking for other great fitting, comfortable reasonably priced jeans until Wrangler provides a 28"" or 29"" inseam."
4,Who What Where Why How,"OK...here i am with a copy of this bangin' azz CD a friend of mine left in my player (no, i did not give it back). Not until I get my own copy at least. There's one problem though... lack of playlist and realistic label information (maybe even a website will do)... So far everything HOT!!! get it while it's here..."
3,waiting 5 years for this?,"i gave 3 stars cos i'm a big chino fan...that being said...how can u go from ""here to save you all"" and ""i told you so"" (2 classics) to this piece of garbage.weak production,weak flow,and i ain't talking about the f**cking singing...plus it's 2 cds with the same exact songs exept the second one is mixed by mr chocc with comments by chino.whatever...keep your money and download the few not so great songs of this album.i'm pissed!!!ps: for those who think it's a great cd go ahead and listen to ""here to save you all"" once again and then listen to this one.just like oc with ""bon appetit"""
2,All that wait for this?,Boring. Messiah is an ok track but there's nothing really special about this album. Chino XL has mad skills but this album feels like a collection of randomly produced beats just thrown together and released as one cd rather than an actual complete album. Maybe that's because that's all this album is? Disapointing...
2,No way ... From Shad Dawg,"He sounds way too much like Eminem and a bit of Jay-Z. And his content is weak. Production however is better than a lot out there today Must be a good reason why Tupac hated him so much.Nice Collabo with Killa Priest ,now he is an original artist. You can really feel his music.Peace !!Shad Dawg"
5,Worth the wait. Perfect album. Best release this year.,"Chino XL is a beast on the mic. I was kind of worried that maybe this album would have Chino trying to get into the mainstream with some cheesy songs.... Nope. Chino XL returned back to his underground roots and dropped probably the best album to come out since Canibus's ""Rip the Jacker"". The tracks/beats are dope and original. Chino stepped up his already untouchable lyrics and ripped it. I did not skip a track. I can honestly say that this CD will be heralded as a classic. There is no way you will not love this cd if you purchase it. The special guests are very suprising. Killah Priest did his thing and held his own...but the suprise was Proof of D12...I did not know that he could rap like that. much props. buy this album. or hate yourself later for not buying it."
5,Bubble gum rappers need to stop rapping now.,"""Nelly dissing KRS-One, we got to stop him"". There's no album this year that will compare to Poison Pen. Chino XL is one of the best lyricist alive. This is a definite banga. You won't be disappointed."
5,Amazing Prog Rock,"The Flower Kings have released some pretty amazing CD's in the past, most notably FLOWER POWER and STARDUST WE ARE. After the rockingly enjoyable RAINMAKER, I was very intrigued to see what Roine Stolt and crew had up their sleeves for UNFOLD THE FUTURE. Letting the more straightforward approach alone, they've gone ahead and recroded perhaps the most progressive CD in their long-running history. A 2 CD set, it simply astounds that this band can create such amazingly intricate songs, with such tightness. Two songs run over 25 minutes, including the first YES-like track, ""Truth Will Set You Free"". The sound is amazing, huge, especially with the addition of a new drumme, who simply astounds. Listen to the intensity of ""Genie In A Bottle"", and you won't be able to not smile. This band is TALENTED, and deserves so much more recognition. If you like YES, you'll love this band, as they seem to be doing the type of progressive tunes that YES should still be doing. Enjoy!"
5,This is a must have!,"This is the best prog CD of the many I've purchased this year. All members of this group put in 110% in this release. They are truly breaking new ground and have firmed up their style. The vocals are top notch. Each vocalist has his own style from Hasse's rocking higher vocals to Roine's excellent style. Zoltan (drums) and Jonas (bass) are an awesome duo and give this group fire. Roine Stolt agains brings us his excellent style that mixes a fair amount of blues with prog playing. Tomas Bodin's keyboards make Rick Wakeman sound dated. He's always coming up with new sounds and paints beautiful backdrops to these musical paintings.I have to totally disagree with the reviewer from Hackensack, NJ. Obviously, he's not very familiar with the prog music of today."
5,Their best to date...,"I have all of the Flower Kings cd's and sit in awe of the majestic and beauty of this new piece of music. Any style of prog rock you enjoy you will find here. Unlike others, I have found things to love and not love about all their other cd's. But with Unfold The Future, there is nothing but greatness. Mr. Stolt has upped the anny for all other in this style of music. He has put together a revamped lineup that blows away the past band. The bass is right where it belongs, up front for us to enjoy, but not overpowered. And the new drummer is truly one of the best I've ever heard. The two bookend epics are simply the best the band has ever made. Not a bad song in between either. Each song flows into the next like they were made for each other and when it is all done, it is not unlikely to go through it all again. This is really that good. Now that Neil Morse has called it quits, we have one true prog super group. Long live The Flower Kings!!!"
5,Amazing,I love the simpsons...They are very fun and great cartoon. The product is good...and good details.
3,DON'T FOLLOW THIS PIPER,Familiar scenario: a group of friends investigate a supposedly haunted hotel and wind up dead. Here's some other tidbits:1. TWILIGHT's Kellan Lutz shows he's not going to establish himself outside the TWILIGHT franchise.2. Wrestler Roddy Piper gives more believable performances in the ring.3. Blood doesn't spurt like cranberry juice.4. There's nothing fresh or scary in this ghost story.AVOID.
3,not that bad of a ghost movie,"Ghosts of Goldfield is not a bad little movie to watch.I was disappointed that Roddy Piper was kinda flat.He was good in They Live and the rest of the cast was ok.Would I buy it? No. There are 2 gruesome deaths but thats it.It could of been a total waste,but its watchable.The story is simple a group of film makers record ghosts in an abandoned Hotel.There is only one ghost perhaps it would of been better if there was more."
3,This isn't Surfer Jack Johnson,"This is a god album but this is not surfer/filmaker/songwriter Jack Johnson. If anyone would like to dispute this please just visit Jack Johnson's home page and you wil see a list of his albums and ""Round One"" is NOT one of them"
3,FINAL SAY! THIS IS NOT SURFER?SONGWRITER JACK JOHNSON!!!!,I don't care what anyone says. This is not Surfer/Songwriter Jack Johnson. PERIOD!! No more needs to be said. Buy it and find out yourself if you are still curious. All you crackheads who think so. Go buy more crack and keep on believing.
3,Five stars? Really?,"Reality check here. The only people who are going to be interested in this CD were in junior high when it came out. It was AWESOME when we were 12, now it's a little innocuous and ""pitchy"" but the nostalgia is great and I still love ""Walking in the Rain"" and ""I wanna be your boyfriend"" as much as I used to. Seriously though, five stars; if you want to sell your hard to find CD for $30... sure."
3,"It works barely, and they should tell you that and offer refunds.","The thing is that this is the best there is and the best just is not very good yet. There are just too many variables. They really need to warn people when they buy because this is expensive stuff. I want a refund. We should not have to rely on the word of others but on the company itself. They are not being honest enough. They should say this is still primitive and hard to use and prone to errors. It is just barely usable at best. It takes a ton of work to make it better and better is still not good. I bought this on a hope and a dream and was shot down by that, being all I was standing on. The problem is that they still have my money. It is not fair but that it is the way it is. I knew it going in but I warn you all now. Watch out. The chances are better than not that this is not a good move buying this. The chances are this will not be what you need it to be.Paul"
1,Software wasn't compatible,"I have the newest version Mac OSX, and use AOL. This software freezes up when I open AOL - so I can't use to type emails (the whole reason I bought it). Furthermore, they have no free telephone support (and highly ""discourage"" any phone calls at all) - and I submitted a trouble ticket more than a week ago and haven't heard a peep."
1,Primitive software masquerading as cutting edge,If you want to waste you life trying to make this work then go ahead. I followed the ilisten instructions to the letter. The first time I invested 5hrs training and the software crashed destroying my profile. The second time I did the same but could not get it any higher than 70% accuracy (a lot of the time it struggled to make it past 50%) then you have got spend a lot of time correcting its mistakes. I can type faster than that. This product is a joke.
1,A waste of money,I bought this item for a Christmas gift for my son. A total waste of money. He had difficulty downloading and no help for MAC. I keep asking him why he wastes his time and money on MAC products but....The worse part of this is that it could not be returned. I'll never buy another MAC product without assurance that it can be returned for a full refund.
5,Ilisten blows dragon away,Ilisten is one heck of a program. Working from both platforms MacSpeach has got it together. After that littel trainning period I was at 99%. I would recomend Ilisten to all that ask!!!!!
3,not what I wanted to hear,"I don't have the product (had to add a star value to enter this comment so I went in the middle) but these reviews were not what I wanted to hear. I recently switched over to Mac because I gave up on trying to keep my PC running, error, virus and spyware free - which seemed to be impossible. The mac has been great for over a year now but the one thing I miss from the pc was Dragon Dictation - I was happy with that program. Very accurate, wrote way faster than I could ever type and spelling was 99% accurate except for some words that sound the same but have different meanings.I was hoping to get a similar program for the Mac but after reading reviews for this and ViaVoice, I don't know."
3,I had to work too hard,"I wanted to love this book as much as I loved Lowboy. Have you ever realized something is brilliant, but that you have to work too hard to understand, and you don't really end up understanding? That was my experience. I didn't look forward to picking it up each evening. That said, these are some amazing and complex characters that we have something to learn from. Dark and disturbing, I needed a shower when I finished this book."
3,Potentially Enslaving Tale,"I had to backtrack and check out some of the interesting history involved here... I had occasional trouble (as usual, you might charge) following clearly along this novel's trail, so I propose 3 stars, 3.5 at most. Don't know what others have been reading to post all these 5 star ratings? C'mon, dudes, how many 5 star books are there? Anyway, in terms of a skeletal framework for this truth-based tale and, even, some of the characterization, this was a fine effort. Twain influence is obvious but I also felt a lot of Blood Meridian undertones and can't help but wish McCarthy had mined this lucrative vein. The author is fairly young evidently but, with a strong editor, shows a potentially strong upside. Still, a pretty good read, see what you think..."
1,DVD Produced By Mormon Church,"It should be noted that the DVD is put out by the Mormon Church - the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and as such, contains publicity for the Mormon church."
4,Very entertaining,This book presents 9 classic Silver Age stories of the JLA. The only fault I could find was that the old ads weren't printed!
5,A Great Basketball Book and So Much More!,"I try to read one basketball book each summer due to the privilege I have of coaching the game. I also read a book per year because I love the game. I am really glad I picked Coach K.'s offering this year. Not only is it a good source of ideas and inspiration for coaches, but anyone who desires suggestions and advice about managemet skills and making more of their opportnities with family, friends, associates and their own personal situations. The experiences, feelings and personal teaching moments that Coach K. reveals to the reader in this book are well worth the time and effort invested by anyone who picks it up. As you read it, visualize the teachings, take notes, and enjoy the ride!!!"
2,Unless you are a B-Ball fan...,"Skip it. Or check it out at the library. I found this book to be so-so. Not any advice you haven't heard before, and too much reminiscing about Duke's good old days."
3,More about basketball and coaching than leadership,"As one who is interested in leadership development, I was disapointed in this book. For those of you who are coaches of athletic teams this book will be usefull. For those who are looking at leadership for business, government etc, there are likely better books out there that cover the subject minus the glory of the Duke basketball team."
5,Very Motivational!,"Let me first preface this by saying I'm a huge Duke fan...now, let me tell you that if you are in any position of leadership, this is a must-read! Coach K's outlook on leadership is very positive and easy to work into any type of job. I even found things to use while teaching 2nd graders!If you are anti-Duke, you may be put off to references to past players, but the leadership ideas are so valuable! If you have ever read Pat Riley's book on leadership and enjoyed it, you will definitely enjoy this one!!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Duke University basketball coach Mike ""Coach K"" Krzyzewski and co-author Donald T. Phillips have written a heartfelt and practical book. The coach weaves his leadership and team strategies into lessons not just for sports, but for business and life. The book, which includes a foreword by Grant Hill (yes, he can write, too!), is filled with personal experiences, anecdotes, and examples. The coach uses sports as a metaphor for management. For example, he advises: ""Never let a person's weakness get in the way of his strengths."" We [...] recommend this well-written book to anyone interested in emotionally balanced team-building, as developed by a winning coach."
1,You can use your money better... by lighting it on fire,"I went into this book a huge fan of Coach K and the Duke program and emerged from it disillusioned to say the least. This book is a lesson in egotistical self-serving praise and it highlights the decline of the college game rather than the strategies of a great coach.The title should be changed to ""How I Became the Greatest Coach in the Land and Why Noone Will Ever Be Like Me.""Surely, you can get a better book elsewhere with significantly more analysis and worthwhile philosophy."
1,What a crock of jit,"Had I wanted 300 pages of Duke propagana, I would have purchased their basketball media guide. Coach K's self love has never been more evident.Coach should stick to what he does best: ruining the careers of McDonald's All-Americans."
2,Hubris,"I find it rather amusing how coaches think that just because they can coach a game, automatically it makes them experts on how businesses are run. Leadership is not generic, it is situational. Leadership is not about a person, it is an activity.This book was given to me as a gift. I liked the basketball anecdotes, being a fan, but as far as advising me on how to be a leader, it's drivel. This is right up there with Rick Pitino, John Calipari, and every other college coach whose ego is out of control."
4,Coach K knows basketball,"Solid, really good book to have if you like basketball and admire Coach K. It could have talked a little bit more about the X's and O's and been longer. It's just a good book for life in general, and well worth the $."
1,Not a Fan,"I went into this book with a rather neutral perspective on ""Coach K"" and the details of his life. However, when I finally emerged from what I found to be a thoroughly soporific experience, I concluded that rarely have I seen such egomania on display. The self-importance one must have to even contemplate writing an autobiography at this stage of their life is pretty bold to say the least. ""Coach K"" delivered on this promise of self-grandeur, and I almost felt pity for him the futher I read. All I can ask is that he realizes the error of his ways, and the literary world won't be subjected to a sequal of ""Coach K's"" wisdom."
1,Coach K's Biggest Fan by Coach K,"I was appalled at this book. It was the most self-serving garbage I've ever read and I am a Duke grad. I am ashamed that he is viewed as a representative of our school. No wonder everyone thinks Duke graduates are nerds and elitist snobs.The book was poorly written and is propoganda at its worst. Thanks, Coach, for giving Carolina fans another reason to view us as egomaniacs and assnecks."
1,...Too Much,"I went in with a neutral attitude regarding ""Coach K"" and his life. However, once I finally emerged from this bastion of self-promotion, I could see what so many others have seen for years. ""Coach K's"" delusions of granduer are almost laughable, and his obvious need for attention is on full display. I guess he thinks being a college basketball coach (at Duke no less!) automatically qualifies him to dispense wisdom about business and life. I can only hope that the literary world is spared the torture of having to read a sequel which instructs us on the rest of life that he forgot in this one."
2,I love the fruit arm on the cover but...,"I don't love the inside of this book as much.I read this book a long time ago and I agree with positive thinking and eating raw foods in order to help build healthy muscles and gain more stamina.But, this book didn't offer me any new information or really inspire me to build more strength or more muscle.It is an easy read, but there are better raw food books and much better body-building books out there."
1,Interesting,"When I purchased this book about a month ago, there was about 3 reviews giving it an average rating of about 4. Then slowly more reviews, brought that rating down to 3, then 2. Finally I put my review in about 2 weeks ago, 1 star by the way, and now that I check and this book ""hasn't been reviewed"".Hmm...is it Amazon's policy to remove badly rated books reviews?So just in case the reviews are indeed gone, here's a quick synapsis: Don't waste your time. Eat raw if you want, I do, but this book is nothing but a catalog for the author's own store. Some of the food prep is good, but the workouts are a joke and would take about 3 hrs to complete, and the other ""advice"" he gives is to buy his friends books. It is poorly written and a complete waste of time."
1,Don't do this...,"There are better books out there concerning weightlifting than this one. And, there are better books out there on eating raw foods.The combination in this book doesn't work.As poster Mike Mahler stated, read Power to the People, or Super Squats, or Dinosaur Training. ""Thor's"" workouts look like he cut and pasted them from Ironman or Muscle and Fitness. They are long and I feel lead to over training.I have this book sitting on a bookshelf. I wish that I had not bought it in the first place."
2,"Recipes are good, but it lacks substance","I have read tons of nutrition books. I found this book helpful for the recipes (blended drinks) and it is really for the beginner only.It lacks real substance and is an extremely easy read (2 hours). Very few really new concepts except if you are brand new to raw food and healthy living. For the body building segment - go get a book on body building - not this,"
4,Good little dictionary,"I like this dictionary. But I think that it lacks some information needed for people unfamiliar with slavic languages. For example, you will find that sorbian word for ""deer"" is either ""jele&#324;"" or ""sorna"", but there is not written that the first word is used for a male deer and the second one for a female deer. Same problem applies for some plural forms (ryba, ryby) etc."
5,Great!,"Great book for any players. Yes, it's an older edition, but in my opinion, better than the newer editions they have now."
3,"Player's Handbook (AD&D, 1st Ed. revised)","This is a great players' resource for refererencing some of the forgotten races and images that were updated and/or revised from 1st edition into the 2nd edition.It is an historical find in terms of role-playing games, since these books are now in extremely limited numbers and are quite collectible. I purchased this book together with the Dungeon Masters Guide (AD&D; 1st Ed. revised) and they are a part of my role-playing game collection.With a few pages with pen marks and a slightly damaged hardback cover, I now have a decent addition to my RPG collection."
1,suckity suck suck,"this game doesnt work. i beat the first level many times (not because its a good game but because i was bored.) Every time i beat it said i did a good job completed all tasks and did everything i needed to, and then went on to explain how the next level was un available. getting bored with that i tried several cheat codes wich all were confirmed to be true even by the game itself and all seemed to work until you played the game and saw they didnt. i sold the game for $3 and was happy."
5,My son LOVES it!,My son absolutely loves this CD and falls to sleep with it almost every night. I like it too. It's great.
5,DESIGNED FOR BOTH ADVENTURERS AND ARDENT PALS,"Every Linux Operating System involves a lot of things. This beautifully reinforced text did all that is needed to be done in providing extensive and reliable information on the OS. It dissected every aspect of the software. Whether you are an ardent Linux pal or just an adventurer, this book will alleviate your tuition problems. From software installation down to security and networking options, there is hardly anything that you would not find in this well-detailed text. Its depth and accuracy is unique. For switchers in particular, this ""Linux Complete"" provides the easiest and the most comprehensive way of adapting to the new Linux environment."
3,yawn,this just shows how some men try to cool off one in the shower one in the pool with a papaya and another with ice cream. this shows guys who strip down to cool of it is good if you like food with light pron. all these guys do is try to cool off but it dose not look that hot because none of them aare sweating lol but hey it is supposed to be a fantasy as if you are watching and they do not know type of deal with this film
5,Very Sexy!,"For anyone who is a fan of erotica, this is a must have. I have a great appreciation for the subtly and sexiness of erotica and this is a very hot, voyeuristic view of a handful hot, sexy guys."
5,Comprehensive coverage of each of the Boeing Jetliners.,"This is a mini encyclopedia of Boeing Jetliners. It provides coverage from the 707 to the 777 (the 777-300 is a future product for the book) including the requirements that led to the design of each, design considerations, all the variants, civil and military, and unique features of each. This is a nice historical reference anytime you want to know more about a particular Boeing Jetliner complemented by beautiful photographic material to match the content. For an overall read about the birth and development of the giant airliner market with a focus on technology and progress consider ""Giant Jetliners"" by the same authors."
4,A Well done In depth look at boeing series jets,"This book is a must for airliners enthuisiast, it gives in depth information on development and also gives some beautiful shots that compliment the book material. It reminds me a lot of other books published by these authors. Another great one for the library!"
4,Unix Internals System Five,"This book outline the Unix System Five operating system internals. The book is somewhat out of date, but still applicable to anyone interested in how Unix works, and how an application interacts with the kernel routines. A background in C would be useful but not required to understand the concepts covered. I would recommend this book"
1,This book is seriously dated.,The prof at my college chose this book as a textbook for a OS course. That is a mistake. This book is too dry. The content is dated. It is simply NOT readable. I don't know why so many people give it good rating. Go figure......
3,The Restless Ones,"This is a Christian film about troubled teens who are going through the pains of growing up and the trouble that can arrive from running with a rough crowd. It stars Johnny Crawford, best remembered as the son on ""The Rifleman"" television series during the 1960's. It has a good message for Christian youth, but by today's standards, it is lack luster in filming techniques. It was made to spread the gospel of Christianity; it was not made to entertain without that message."
2,"Standard Defever quirkiness, which few will get","First, let me say that the two star review is for the album's lack of appeal to many people, not due to its musical quality.I WANT YOU TO LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS is Warren Defever's ""first"" solo album, that is if you ignore the 15 years of his essentially one-man songwriting team His Name is Alive.Recorded in a single day in November of 1998, most of the tracks were recorded on an old wire-loop recorder out of the first half of the century, making them sound truly....well, ""good"" definitely isn't the adjective. The later tracks are recorded with more modern equipment, although they are essentially two-chord musings.Listening to this album, a person familiar with Warren's idiosyncracies would guess the album was something of a joke. Not meant to sell a billion copies, not meant to change the face of music, 100 YEARS was recorded because Warren felt like it.And whether or not you should buy it depends on what you think of Warren's quirkiness."
2,Okay book,"This story line sounded interesting that is the reason I decided to buy this book. Sadly, the book was not that great.Jordan, needed to grow a spine, she had no backbone whatsoever in this story.Jordan, acts wishy-washy. She can't seem to make up her mind whether she wants to be with Mike or not. I do understand her concerns because he is 10 years younger than she is. But, after a while I wanted her to make up her mind once and for all.At times it seemed like Jordan and Mike had a father-daughter relationship, instead of two people in a romantic relationship.Also, there are too many different subplots in this book.The dialogue is weak. The love scenes are not spicy, and they also lack passion.By the middle of the book, I got really bored, also the rest of the story started to drag. I could not wait until I got to the end of the story.I doubt if I ever will read any books written by Karen White Owens again."
3,Good Read,"The issues between Jordan and Michael -- younger man, older woman and former teacher, former student -- were well thought out and well written. Jordan was also dealing with the insecurities of being a burnt-out teacher. She leaned on Michael a lot, but in the end you saw the glimpse of her regaining her self-confidence."
3,Backbone required by heroine,Ok Jordan for a 38 year old woman with understandable reluctance to be with a 28 year old former student you sure acted very immature. Mike seemed like he was the older character and was very patient with his love. The school drama was well written and would have made this at least a 4 star book if not for Jordan's irritable wishy washy ways- after 10 years is a big gap but is not the 'old enough to be your mother gap' how many 10 years olds go around having kids? very few.
5,What a beautiful 'motivation' story!,"...expecting a story of a young little girl in the country side of the old English land, I ended up admiring the great courages that Anne had shown in order to prove herself to Gilbert... that she worth something to this guy. The way the writer potrayed the life of Anne during her childhood was quite detail and it really made Anne as if as I am journeying together with her throughout her story. ... and the life of Marita... at the end turn into a happy mom instead of keeping her face long! Anne had been her motivator! There are lots of humors... well,a nice story shouldn't be serious throughout the pages... I really admired this book and I am looking forward for the rest of the Anne's series."
2,Got the wrong composer,"I didn't buy this yet but the composer is wrong.These are Brazilian works composed by Francisco Ernani Bragain about 1898. He died in 1945.Most catalogues seem to attribute them to Antonio Braga,who was born in 1929.I realize there are lots of composers named Braga.There is also Gaetano Braga, who wrote the famous angel's serenade"
4,Finally got it to work and satisfied with it,"It took me some time to get this working with my DI-624 router but finally got it working. The tricky part was getting it to work with WEP. I had to configure my router accordingly:* WEP* HEX 128Bit Key* Open system (Shared Key DOES NOT WORK)The image quality is okay (I'm guessing that you're never going to get a great quality imaging unless you buy a professional level equipment). Why am I still happy with it? I have it as a security camera for my apt while I'm at work. I don't think I will be able to identify the intruder but, by using the motion detector feature, I can be notified if there is an intruder and call the police. That's good enough for me."
1,waist of money,I'm so mad I bought this. There are many more products worth twice as much at half the price. My router wasn't compatible and to configure my router just to work with the wireless camera is stupid to say the least. shop around for better products. this product is garbage.
2,Delived as promised,"Hard to find item and they did have it and delived as promissed. Working fine in my older ""professionsl"" camera."
2,"San Disk, compact Flash, 1GB","The memory card works in the camera to take photos, how ever the photos can not be down loaded. I have an other San Disk, Compact Flash, 1GB that I have used for 8 years that works wonderful, down loads every time. My question is why will one work an not the other?"
5,SanDisk 1gb Flash Card,"I needed a 1gb flash card for my Boss 864 digital recorder. It was just what i needed!!! i put it in the recorder and have been making new music ever since. Great purchase, the price was about right as well."
2,Don't waste your time with Edwards,"The main problem I find in this book is that Edwards uses an example, and then to build upon it adding more functionality, extends it...again and again etc. You are left with a confusing hierarchy of classes.So, if you want to jump in, find out which classes are needed to build clients and services, and get to it, anything by this author is not worth your time.You are either forced to use a hierarchy like he does ( which is a bad idea ) or back track through every one of is classes to find out what functionality you want.The Wrox book on Jini might be the best book around.The only reason I even gave it 2 stars was because if you do want to learn about the lower level/ non utility classes and how they work the first few chapters are ok for this.Also, god forbid you have a question for the author...don't expect a response."
2,rushed to publication,"This book looks like it was rushed into publication. The example code is formatted incorrectly in every example and much of the text is straight out of Edwards' ""Core Jini"" (a better book but somewhat outdated). I also don't like Edwards' informal style of writing. The text is peppered with colloquialisms and redundancy and is generally not concise. He explains the one to four page code chunks awkwardly in text before or after the code rather than provide useful comments in the code. The comments that are in the code are sometimes obvious like documenting a function ""addRates"" as ""adds a new currency exchange rate"". I hope Edwards is writing a better book for Jini 1.2. Keith, if you are, let me know and I'll help you with that pesky English."
2,Meh.,"Owned these batteries for approximately 3 years, used constantly first 18 months, then put away for a year, they now will not even think about taking more than a surface charge."
5,Great upgrade,Purchased these to upgrade an older set of Sony's that were only 1900mAh's. These work just as well and have that little bit of extra uumph. I've had two sets (4 each) of the Sony 1900mAh batteries that I've used in my digital camera for 5 years now. I still have one working set (combining different ones as a few have given out) that work at about 50% of their previous glory. I've taken them all over the world and even used them scuba diving down to 100 feet.These new ones have been through 4 full charges and are working like a charm. Looking forward to five years of great charges!
3,Any one know the name of a charger i should use for these?,I bought these batteries because I was desperate at the time and later realized they were rechargeable. I was reading the warnings and other nonsense and was hoping someone could tell me what kind of charger I should use so I don't blow out these batteries. I haven't a clue what I can and can't use for these batteries.
5,Excellent product!,"On the basis of the first 2 months of operation, this is an excellent value for the money! A very bright projection, and quiet operation. No problems thus far."
1,Unwatchable,"This is the worst ""based on a true story"" serial killer movie ever. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Promise unfulfilled,"6,000 chunks of trivia, presented in random order, do not add up to a fulfilling entertainment experience -- or really any experience at all. With a space ship crafted of kitchen foil and a helmet to match, on a ""set"" that would have been embarrassingly amateurish in the '60s, some nebish in glasses & jeans talks to the camera or mimes silly activities in a multitude of minute-long fragments. The idea seems to be that he's stranded in space and things have become horrific back home, but after watching segments with mounting impatience for 3/4 of an hour, I finally had to admit that a coherent story was never going to be revealed. Whatever you do, don't waste $25 on this self-absorbed piece of navel lint."
4,Howard Hewett,"This album is pretty much what you'd expect from an artist like Howard Hewett. Fantastic! 'I Do' and 'The More I Get(the more I want)' are weak songs, but the rest of the material on this album more than makes up for these minor flaws."
2,Will not work with Dlink router with encryption on,"I would have given it a 5 stars if it could work with my Dlink DI-624 with encryption on. If you use it without encryption, it would run just fine. Turn on the encryption (either 64 or 128 bits) and the camera is totally lost. If this problem is what Sony created to get consumers into buying Sony-brand Router, then they should think again. I paid $199.99 for the camera at Frys. Seems to me someone has figure out its problem and tried to get rid of them as soon as they can."
2,Doesn't work long...,"It took a while to get set up, but once I got it working things worked great... for about an hour. Then it overheated. First the sound went to crap. And then the wireless reception went to zero. I returned it to Fry's, anticipating that I would pick up a replacement, but I noticed the shelf was full of returned/repackaged units. Gotta love Fry's reselling faulty items. Don't bother."
3,Windows Only,"First and foremost -- the integrated web server requires ActiveX. Firefox, OSX, and Linux are out of luck.I set up an ftp upload to a standard site but the frequency is limited to 1/sec and there's no way to control to pan & tilt.In theory, I could store the video stream using the packaged software (which runs as a client app only) and then serve the MPEG4 using Darwin (yeah, right). In practice, the packaged software saves the MPEG4 stream in a new, strange format that I can't open with QuickTime.Secondly, the setup software is essential and also Windows only -- there's no way to initialize the camera without this software (the network config page, interestingly, does work with Firefox, et al).No problems connecting this to my Apple Base Station and manually opening the port.Integrated Web Site looks great in Explorer 6.If anyone has figured out how to stream with a normal browser please let me know."
5,Sight and Audio Recording - Not bad for the price !!!,"With the proper set up this camera works great. I was a little worry to purchase this at the beginning because of a poor experience I had with both Linksys and D-Link network cameras. But Sony has step it up and offers a camera with great video and free software bundle. One thing I've experience in set up is to get the correct router. I think they list the following as their compatible routers:* Linksys WRT54G* Linksys WRT54GS* D-Link DI-504* D-Link 604* D-Link 624* Netgear WGT624* Netgear WGT634UThe the correct router, set up is a breeze. Setting up the WEP encryption is a little confusing, but as long as the router key and camera key matches, everything works."
2,Nice product - no support,"Sounds like that last guy had a problem somewhere between the keyboard and his chair :)The sony cam has a great picture and sound. Problems - it has NO support from Sony what-so-ever. If you are like the last guy - then you need support every step of the way.Also you cannot plug this product into your website in any way.The other major issue is that it ONLY works with IE, not firefox or any other browser. Generally I would say I regret buying this camera."
2,Noisy,"This is picking up the static noise from some extra fans I have inside my computer, possibly through the audio cable or through the DC power wires. It's really loud. This is a nice idea, but I'll be throwing it out soon shortly."
5,Good passive speakers,"It uses one 5.25 drive bay and one PCI slot on chassis, comes with 1 molex 4 pin connector,screws,and male to male audio RCA connector w PCI plateFits nice on my case, good for personal audio, is not as loud as regular speakers, i wish that i would come with a 9 pin Audio connector for MBPSU will power this speakers meaning a free electical outlet :) less cables to worry about"
1,Failed at the book club,"We chose this for our book club. It was universally disliked, which was a record for us. Really poor work from this normally good author."
2,This is my first and last time to read this author's work.,"I was so disappointed in the story because I expected more humor and less cruelty. If Stump is the symbol of the younger, materialistic generation and ""The Old Ones"" of our aging population, I shudder to think what Crews is predicting for the future. With a catalyst such as Too Much, whose intelligence I found hardly believable from her own background, we won't have to worry about society's demise by the atomic bomb because we'll surely destroy ourselves morally. Although I think Crews made some accurate social commentary, I don't think he had to use so much sexual imagery to do it. Personally, I had to discipline myself to push through some of the ""bathtub scenes"" with Stump and with the ""mop"" just to complete the book. By the time I got to the conclusion, I really only read it because I had already invested so much time and energy in it. Maybe my expectations were just erroneous; after all, this was the first of his works that I've read."
3,CREWS LIGHT,"This tortured soul has been one of my favorite writers since I first read him twenty-five years ago. And I must admit that CELEBRATION contains some of the fascinating elements that drew me to his other works. The biggest problem here is that the story is too far over the top. Furthermore, the characters tend to be fantastic rather than fiercely real, as we've come to expect from this writer. Nevertheless, the book is filled with shimmering passages of prose that are reminiscent of earlier work and is a far cry better than the disastrous MULCHING OF AMERICA."
3,Quick read for adventure,"I have read the Dark Hunter Series by Ms Kenyon. While those books were very good, the premise was getting old. I think she has come up with a winner compromise.Josh Steele goes to prison after nearly killing his superior officer. While the reasoning was believable, the action was not. However, it was the basis for the rest of the book and it was a really fun read. The Sydney character was a good foil and the repartee very good.My only complaint: this book should have been a paperback and I will get the next one from the library."
2,It was a little too perfect!,The beginning was interesting enough for me to get about half way through the book when I decided I didn't feel any real excitement for the characters. The character's development seemed rather rushed and thrown together. The heroine just didn't have me convinced that she was BAD and after awhile neither did Steele. The whole book felt like it was rushed and the ending definitely was rushed. I didn't really care if the characters got hooked up or not. I read the whole book just to see how it would end and I was really disappointed. How dorky! I won't read anymore of Ms Kenyon's BAD books cause the 1st one was just too dorky for me to like.
2,Lackluster and boring,"Just finished Bad Attitude and am rather disappointed. I actually read the other BAD series books first, and came back to this one. Glad I did, because otherwise I wouldn't have continued with the series.The characters were so-so, the plot was lacking in both romance and drama. In my opinion there was no build-up to the action OR romance. The entire story just kind of trotted along, and never captured my attention. I think if the book had of been longer, going deeper in character building, suspense, romance and all other aspects of the book it maybe could have been better; it just felt rushed and not interesting.I love Sherrilyn's books, always, but this was my least favorite by far. Not sure I'd waste my money on it again, maybe try to find it at the library first."
2,Puhleese!,I like the author's style of writing and the wit.. but that is all that carried me through this book. The story line was way too hard to swallow in way too many places! I could write a novel on the inconsistancies in this book. I won't - all I will say is come on!! Shouldn't there be at least a little bit of reality here? Well. There isn't.
2,blah,"Soft, easy read. Can be finished in no time at all. The characters are far from being rounded and the topic is far fetched. Steele is a army sniper in jail for taking a shot at his superior officer. Syd works for a ghost governement agency that recruits him. What bothered me most about the book and caused me to give it so few stars is the nonchalant attitude about the taking of lives. You have people who are hired to kill, and it's all passed off for the greater good. Not to mention our hero doesn't seem to have a problem about going against his own father. That's just not right."
1,good 'n bad,"As with all of Sherrilyn Kenyon's books ""Bad Attitufe"" was a great read. I love her characters. The story keeps your interest from the first page to the last, leaving you with a sense of almost loss when finished. I keep looking around for another of her books immediately after I am done reading one."
5,Mormonism Unmasked,"This is a great book and came to my house in perfect condition. I was really surprised at the condition of the book and the book is also a very good one to read to learn a deep understanding of mormonism. Though the book is a few years old, it still contains very good information."
1,dum dum dum,i think this book is absolutely ridiculous and the writer needs to spend his time doing something better with his life instead of bashing other peoples beliefs. He should focus on helping those of his own religion. He should take some lessons from the members of the church and see how they base their life on building a stronger relationship with jesus christ and heavenly father...what a loser. It seems to me that all those that actually believe this crap are too easily influenced and those members of the church that are swayed by this information are morons. If mormons are christian because they base all their beliefs on christs life and becoming more like him then who is chrisitan... i would truly like someone to tell me what a true christian is because i think this man is severely mistaken.
5,very informative,"This is a great book if you are looking for side by side info. As a Christian, I found it to be a well presented book. I felt they were careful with the facts. Very useful. The fact two people who had mormon background had input was a plus."
4,Excellent and educational book,"This book is a must read for anyone who has left the Mormon Church and, if members of the Mormon church would read it, it would serve as a great source of information and ""eye opening"" for them. I believe we would see more people actually questioning something they are not encouraged to question and it would be for their own good. This book is done in a very informative and tasteful manner and is a good read."
1,Unmasking the agenda,"An example of the tone and agenda of the book:Page 70 suggests that Mormons believe that God the Father had sexual relations with Mary to conceive Jesus. This is salacious, and absolutely incorrect, taken out of context from something a church leader said over 100 years ago in an attempt to paint the church in a sinister light.Mormons believe exactly what the New Testament says about the virgin birth - That Jesus is the Son of God conceived by the Holy Ghost.For those who would like an honest take on Mormon theology I recommendThe Biblical Roots of Mormonism - by Eric Shuster and Charles Sale-Brian"
1,Disingenuosness Unmasked,"R. Philip Roberts is either an extremely poor researcher, or he is outright dishonest. When I first started reading this book I was recording and correcting all the errors in fact and in logic that I noticed. After the first 20 pages of the book I found myself challenging almost every paragraph. I had wanted to put them in my review, but the amount of corrections would be tantamount to a whole new book, so I gave it up. I finished reading the portions available on Google books, and am convinced that this attack on good Christian Mormons is disingenuous to say the least.I found myself wishing I had the option of rating this book less than one star due to the obvious lack of consideration, by Roberts, for an honest balance of the facts. He is more interested in painting Mormons in as negative light as possible, than giving a true and sincere evaluation.Tisk tisk Mr. Roberts. A good Christian should hold himself to a higher standard than that."
1,Such an un-christian book,"This is like reading a book about George Bush that John Kerry wrote. It is completley unprofessional and biased. It is extremley one sided. It should have views from active Mormons and the disgruntled ex-Mormons alike. It is just your basic run of the mill Anti-Mormon material. Nothing new here, just the same anti-mormon material that's been around for years.Instead of tearing down a church, the author should write a book on why his beliefs are so great and why we should be following him. This book would recieve a failing grade in any university for it's terrible one-sideness. If you are getting information from professors from ""Christian"" churches, then you should also get information from ""Mormon"" professors and leaders. Such an un-christian book to attack another faith like that."
4,response to get real people,"I am an Asian-American. If I call myself an African-American, does that make me any more African-American just because I refer to myself as such. Same with the Mormon church. No matter how much it refers to itself as the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints, it is not a Christian church (i.e. affirm Jesus Christ as the SOLE instrument of life and salvation) in any of its actions, tenets or proclamations. Mr. Roberts exposes the great lies and fallacies behind this self-proclaiming Christian sect."
1,When 'Christians' act like this...,"As a student of Religious Studies, I think it is incredible that there are Christians who are shocked that there are actually people who don't believe in God or Jesus. When you see 'true Christians' write books like this- it is totally understandable. Oh well, Christianity has always had a history of intolerance, dating back to the fights between of the 'proto-orthodox' Christians and the 'gnostic' Christians of 100+ A.D. The Mormon Church's formal name is The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints. Can you be anymore Christian?It's hard to convince atheists that you have something to offer when you squabble over who gets to be in the club. At least Mormons don't stoop so low to write books about why everyone else is absolutly wrong. (Don't believe me- try finding one here at Amazon!)When 'Christians' act like this, maybe it is the best interest of Mormons not to be included among them."
3,The Hope Chest,Susan Kearney's story was the best out of all. This book was'nt what I expected. None the less the stories were put together very nicely by Susan Kearney in her part of the story. All in all not bad.
1,Trite and boring,"After reading Dragonmaster, I was appalled to find this writer, Chris Bunch, had the audacity to write more than this one book. His characters are neither likable on unlikable, the writing over all is trite and lacking and disjointed. As to magic, it seems as though he threw it in as an afterthought as in, ""oh yeah, I'm writing a fantasy novel. There should be magic!"" His descriptions are simply not there from the character of the weather to the content of the battle grounds. In one scene, the main character sees an enemy soldier standing over three of his fellow soldiers and kills the enemy soldier. No description of the action, no reaction from the enemy soldier as if he's just standing there waiting to be killed by the main character. All in all, if you're thinking about buying this book, don't and move on to better fare."
2,"Maybe ok for YA, but disappointing","I'd read some of Bunch's work before - mainly, his trilogy Seer King / Demon King / Warrior King - and it was pretty good, so I expected this to be at least on a similar level. Unfortunately, it's not. Maybe if you have only read children's books before taking this on, it would be a good read, but if you've read very much quality fantasy at all, this is a very trite read. As others have noted, characterization is thin, and the prose is competent but very pedestrian. It almost feels like an outline that with a little more imagination and flair would have been a pretty fun read. I actually didn't even expect this to be anything but a light and fun read going in, but it's not even that - it's just limp, and I had to force myself to finish. It's easy reading though, so at least it went fairly quickly."
2,It could have been...but wasn't nearly close enough..,"Well, what to say...I didn't last long with this book...put it down after page 30.I was expected to be transported into another world, to be introduced to an amazing character/s, and to travel with those characters through their trials and tribulations.. Not this book.If you're into fantasy, Robert Jordan, Lorna Freeman, and David Drake (so far) are much better..."
3,reprinted edition,"This title was originally published in 2003 as ""Storm of Wings"" book one of the Dragonmaster trilogy.The cover artwork has been changed,published by Orbit.Still selling on Amazon in standard paperback(cheaper)."
5,WoWoWoWoWoWoWoWoWoW,"THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!I dont normall write reviews but wow! this CD floored me 100%! there are so many emotions this cd invokes. It is sad to see them opening for Simple Plan (dont get me wrong I have nothing against Simple Plan, just not my favorite) So if you choose to buy one cd today than make it Plain White T's -- All That We Needed"
4,Beautifully Acoustic,"I really, really love this CD. I was hooked indefinetely when I heard ""Hey the Delilah"".It flows so smoothly, and it's not too fast and not too slow. And the lyrics to the song a moving.Tom's voice is also fitting to the songs.I think this is a fabulous group.The songs can sound alot alike sometimes, but other than that, a great album."
4,Definately a good CD,"Plain White T's CD is definately takes care of your alternative itch. The CD has really good pacing, is fun and and smart."
2,One Good Song,"This CD get 2 stars for the last song and 0 stars for the rest. I bought this CD spefically for the last song, ""Hey There Delilah."" I had hopes that there might also be some other songs on the CD that would be worth listening to. In my opinion the last song was the only one worth listening to because all of the others are simply annoying."
4,haven't changed and its great!,"what a great sophomore album. most bands cant follow their debut with something this good. ""Hey There Delilah"" is an amazing acoustic song with lots of heart. which can be said about all of their songs. they're all about heartbreak and bitterness just like any good emo/punk band. highly recommended!"
4,Good pants at a good price,"These are a good addition to your business casual wardrobe. They are the usual long style, and have an extra wide hem at the bottom. Unusual for pants these days that they have the metal fastners, but do not have the inside button on the waistband that help to further secure the fastner. The have a short zipper but the waist band makes the waist high enough you won't have to worry about your undies showing. The waist size does seem slightly smaller than most at the size I bought, didn't require as much shrinkage for me to wear. They have great stretch. I have the khaki ones but not sure what the difference is between Khaki and classic khaki colors. I plan on buying more at this price."
4,"It works, but a little hard to get on and off of lens","I have this installed on my canon kit lens 18-55 IS and it works great. It's a little tough to install at times and I wonder about the long term durability of it, however, for the price it's well worth the money that I invested. It works and I'm satisfied."
1,Save your Money Get A Vello,"This lens hood just kinda sits on the end of your lens,,if you touch it or the wind blows it will fall off. Not worth any money to me. I would get the Rubber Ones,,Really Like those,,or a Vello,,it has tabs on the side where you can attach it,in all, the customer service was good, the firs one I got would drop of as soon as you put it on and they sent me another at no cost."
4,Does the trick...,Price was right for this little lens hood. Fit my Canon lens perfectly. I have no problems with it whatsoever.
5,My first lens hood...,"Bought this lens hood my Canon T2i kit (18-55mm) and it is just as described. This is my first lens hood, so I was sure I would notice what many of the other reviews stated about it being a ""snug fit"" for the first few fittings, but it seemed fine to me. I have used it and reversed it numerous times over the past week and I have had no issues - this is definitely a great purchase!"
4,Ok for the price,"Could be a firmer plastic. A bit too tight on my EF-S 18-55mm lens. But, ok for the price."
3,Canon ef 18-55 lens hood,"Pros: Price, Hood that works on 18-55 lensCons: A bit flimsy compared to other hoods. Fits a bit to tight on my lens."
4,Does the job and then some!,I use this hood for my default Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens on my Rebel XSI. It does what it is supposed to do and then some:Pros-Blocks out light glare from the side-Protects my lens from dust & scratches-Serves as a nice grip for manually focusing the lensCons-Not the greatest plastic construction. Could be a firmer plastic but I'm just being picky
4,lens hood,"I use this on my EF-S 18-55 stock lens for my XSi, it works great and is a fraction of the cost of similar hoods."
5,arachnophobia soundtrack,I love this cassette. Every song is good I love the final closing song that is instrumental and like how it carries pieces from the movie on it.
5,Amazing Outdoor Speakers,"To the guy who said these don't have bass.. are you crazy? These have more bass than any outdoor speakers in its class. I've owned Bose, Yamaha, and now Klipsch 650's, and there's no comparison. Anyways, these outdoor speakers are great, great, great."
5,A Bold Step Ahead in the 'Electro' Direction,"Previous Crocodile Shop cds have been brilliant pieces of ""Art"" yet sometimes in sacrifice of the 'song'... it seems as if now that they shortend the name to Croc Shop (from 'Crocodile') they also 'edited' the overall style of the bands as well. There are still all the great dark melodies that the band has offered in the past; but now the vocals are laid on top of a more solid & bouncy electronic(a?) foundation. Think: New Order meets the Underworld with a dash of Front 242 thrown in for old times sake!Dont take my word for it; there are plenty of sites w/ samples of this great new sound for Croc Shop - search around & visit the bands official website at crocshop.com for all the info on this really stellar release! Dont miss out !!A ""MUST OWN"" For fans of: Depeche Mode, New Order, Underworld & Dirty Vegas, too!"
1,Option Trading Traps CD,"This is a poorly produced CD. It seems to end half way through his talk about options leaving you hanging. I don't know if the CD is defective, or it was manufactured that way. I think all it is that Larry McMillian is selling a recording of a speech he made to an investment class. Not recommended. I still gave it a star because the information he presents on the CD is pretty good, although very basic. The title doesn't make any sense to me. Disappointing because I've heard Larry talk in person, and he was a great speaker."
4,a good book t o read,"Mail Order Murder, is a good book to read I attended most of the trial in Coryell County,that was held for Jack Reeves. This book was an accurate account of the trial, and the murders that took place. If you like a book about true murders,read this book."
2,Don't waste your time folks,I was very familiar with the story having lived in this area and knew it well so out of interest picked it up. Big mistake! Bad writing and bad story telling is all I can say. Don't waste your time.
3,Using financial security as a lure...,"The facinating true-life account of an ex-military Texan (Jack Reeves) with a penchant for recycling wifes. If you are Filipino, this cautionary tale will be especially poigant given that the last victim, Emelita Villa, met her death while persuing the American dream. The writing is substandard, but definitely approachable if English is your second language. All in all, a great story that deserved a better writter."
3,A Memorable and Forgettable Book!,"I remember this book because of the story about Jack Reeves, quite a sadistic murderer, who killed his mail order wife from the Philippines because she was going to leave him after an abusive relationship. Here is a story is decently written but could be better and the details about Jack's past relationships with women is well-documented. As always, there is always room for improvement. This book is definitely for true crime readers like myself. It goes quite quickly too."
1,"Horrible Murder, Lousy Book",The title is catching but author falls short. I like unbiased writing. In a murder we don't need Ms. Springer to offer her views which is exactly what she does. Give me the exact details and don't flower it with lousy writing. Author could take lessons from Ann Rule.
2,Disappointment,I was very familiar with this story having lived in the area and written about it in the news (I'm a reporter) But I found the style of writing here leaving a lot to be desired. It was difficult to follow and I knew the facts so for someone who didn't know about the case it would have to be extremely difficult to follow. Having knowledge of the case I excitedly ordered the book. I wish I hadn't. This story was too intriguing to come out so boring and jumbled.
2,do not buy it.... take my word for it.,"stupid, boring, irrelevent,changes subject every 2 mins,belive me because i love history and documentarys but hated this one"
4,"Not what I expected, but very good","I had expected this book to be a more traditional political and military history, a ""who and where"" type. This book is actually a very thorough handling of Russian religion, art and literature. The author seems to assume that the reader already knows basic facts of Russian history, such as its leaders, its major wars, etc. However, even if the reader is not familiar with these aspects of history, the book is still very readable. I feel I have a greater understanding of Russian literature and culture than I might have with a more traditional history. It is unfortunate that the the book only covers up to the mid 1960s, because the events of the past 15 years are unprecedented since the revolution of 1917."
4,"Great History, mediocre writing","This really is a great account of a nation with a long, deep history. It does cover Russia in a very nearly exhaustive fashion. Unfortunately it's repetitive nature detracts from its ability to be readily absorbed."
5,"A Humorous, Original Tale of the West","This was a funny, original, and surprisingly moving story about a young man and his cow/buffalo. Any book that can be as entertaining as this one deserves a five-star rating. I have already recommended it to both adult and young friends. Congratulations on such a wild, woolly and wonderful book, Mr. Hardman"
5,One of the best books I have read in a long time!,"I bought the paperback because it sounded interesting. I have never really enjoyed westerns but something about the premise of the book appealed to me. Since starting Sunshine Rider I haven't been able to put it down. It's a terrific book full of humor, adventure and wonderful characters. The plot is full of original events and laugh-out-loud situations. This is one of the best books I have read in quite a while. I have 40 pages left to read and am now taking my time because I don't want the book to end. You don't have to read westerns or be a vegetarian to enjoy this wonderful story. You will be amazed by this sleeper of a book just as I have been."
1,Yuck! This is a horribly stupid book.,"I love to read and I'll read lots of different kinds of books, so when Isaw this one I thought it might be good. Was I ever wrong! A stupid book . I wouldn't recommend it even the most easily amused western reader."
1,I RETURNED THIS PRODUCT AFTER ONE DAY,"Poor fit on the ears, very uncomfortable to wear. The wireless ""neat"" effect fades after a while once your ears are hurting so bad from being pinched. Not a good product. Not fun to wear. Not good period. Listen to the reviews on this site or you'll make the same mistake I did."
1,Not so Good. Latency is another problem,"Besides the drawbacks mentioned in other reviews, it also has quite a bit of latency. If just listening to music, it wouldn't matter. I wanted to use it with my guitar, plugging it into the processing unit. The problem is that there is a second or two delay between playing a note and hearing it in this wireless headphone. Also, the charging lights didn't work at all."
1,Poor fit and performance,"I have purchased Saitek devices before, and have been happy with the product/price. However, these headphones fall far short. First off, unless you have a small head, I don't see how they can fit a person properly (I'm a hat size 7 3/8, large, I know, but there are bigger). Even with the longest band, they pulled uncomfortably. The actual earpiece/over the ear loop isn't very flexible either. Then, the range (advertised at 10 METERS) is way overestimated. I could only get to about 8 FEET with constant sound. At 10 FEET, I got drop outs. The sound itself wasn't bad, although at soft moments, you could hear a slight hiss. Overall, if I could give this thing ZERO stars, I would. These are on their way back!"
1,wireless is crappy,"sound quality: not badwireless: SUCKSi bought it for the wireless, but it keeps skipping and the receiver's only in my pocket...now, most of the time, i'm on wired...WHICH MADE THE WIRELESS POINTLESS. for the price i bought the headphones, i could have gotten some decent WIRED headphones instead..."
2,"uncomfortable, poor performance, bad quality assurance","the headset was dead on arrival. well, actually, it charged and worked for about 1 minute before dying and needing a recharge. i wonder if i got a bad piece or a refurbished one. the adapter to the mp3 was a little flimsy and didn't hold very well. the product was rather uncomfortable around the ears and hung at the back of the neck. i'd go for the logitech wireless ones. anyhow, had to return these. quality wasn't that great."
2,"Works fine, but with a major caveat","I bought these for use with my desktop PC so I could listen to music while I'm working.The problem is that the transmitter ONLY works off of a battery charge. In other words, leaving the transmitter plugged in to the AC charger and turned on all day will drain down the battery until you switch the transmitter off and let it recharge."
2,Fancy looks but fair performance and poor workmanship,"If you do decide to purchase these headphones, keep in mind that the 3.5mm insulated cable connecting the jack to the transmitter is susceptible to wear and tear. After having them in my pocket attached to my player, the insulation and some wires tore off. Also, one side of the headphone's LED lights doesn't work. At least they're better than the low-end Logitechs."
5,As good as you're going to get,"The other reviewer is way off base, in my opinion. I've known these recordings for 40 years and this is the best reproduction of Busoni's pianism anyone has a right to expect. Still plenty of hiss, but a real piano tone is evident, the pedaling is noticeable, and the shadings there as well. Keep the volume on high and adjust your hearing to the background sizzle and as a listener you'll be fine.Also Egon Petri plays the the tarantella movement, (the fourth) of the Busoni piano concerto with Hans Rosbaud like a bat out of hell. Phenomenal player and great conductor. They just don't make them like that anymore; sorry. This recording is indespensable to anyone interested in the history of pianism and recorded sound. Highest recommendation. -- Geoffrey Dorfman"
4,Khater,"Interesting, but difficult to read, to many formal resolutions and letters. Anyway for those who like original sources on the subject - great book"
3,Interesting Original Sources!,"The original sources cited in this book are certainly right from the horse's mouth, so to speak. The media sources included in this book are all originals. The author also provides analyses for these sources, which provides background information to help the reader understand the mindset of the authors."
2,broke in less than a week,had this product less than a week and it broke. i understand it's plastic but the ball bottomed out and busted through. would not recommend to purchase unless they make this product better. all they have to do is just make it longer!!
3,"Good, but flawed","Good subject, interesting (although sometimes tangled) presentation.But the mathematical mistakes just spoil everything. Like the proof of dichotomy convergence using Weierstrass delta-epsilon thing for continuity. What was that? Looked like the author himself didn't quite understand what he was trying to do, so he just crumpled the proof: ""Hence... Hence...""."
1,A fellow of infinite jest?,"I found this a well-researched book by a knowledgeable author, marred only by his putting it into words. The presentation is perhaps that of an overdue term paper at three a.m., when the un-numbered pages have collapsed into a pile on the floor.The arrogant mannerisms, cliches and hackneyed phrases, ideosyncratic abbreviations, and lack of linear structure make it a book that, once you put it down, is hard to pick up again.I bought this book hoping to bring away from it some fresh perspectives on infinity, to benefit the calculus students I am teaching. I left it empty-handed."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"this book offers no recommendation for what mathematical principles a reader should be familiar with before starting it but any claim of it being accessable to an average reader would be misleading.if seems not only like no attempt was made to relate most of what is being described to any commonsense foundation, but that it was academically overwritten into a code that even someone who already knew all the information contained in the book would have trouble following. in my ironic experience the ""emergency glossary"" definitions themselves contain more undefined or ambiguous terms than any other part of the text."
1,"awful, awful, awful","The author's worst tendencies are on display here. He takes a simple, elegant subject and reduces it to a disorganized mess. Practically unreadable, for both the layperson and mathematician alike.I could carve a better book out of a banana."
1,The Truth Comes Out,"I was always perplexed by the rave reviews for mediocre books, but I recently read in THE NEW YORK TIMES that the author's friends have been writing them in order to help sell the lackluster tomes.This book is awful. It makes no sense. It rambles. Wallace is no mathematician, but rather than admitting his resounding ignorance, he hides it behind footnotes and cutesy gimmickery. There are hundreds, if not thousands of better math books such as Prime Obession and A New Kind of Science."
2,"Good idea, Bad Book","When DFW isn't using undefined acronyms, or rubbing his absurdly large vocabulary in your face, the book achieves what I believe to be its goal, that is, to explain the origins and problems associated with infinity. The puzzles he uses are very interesting and provide a good look into the problems the notion of infinite can put forth.However, the book is unneccesarily complicated and the meaning of many words/phrases/ideas continue to be used throughout the book without explaination. The book attemps to be accessable to ""readers who do not have pro-grade technical backgrounds"" but fails (at least for me) considering I was often confused although I had taken calc 1 in high school a year before reading it."
2,Poorly written and with some serious error(s),"I suppose this might just be his style of writing but I just can't stand it. Having read 9 other math related books over the past month, this was a huge disappointment. He uses all sorts of acronyms and idiosyncrasies that just go too far. I got half way through it and then decided to skim seeing if I could find anything that caught my eye. Thinking maybe his discussion of the Continuum Hypothesis should be good, I read that. Of course, he misstated it, confusing which equality was known and which was hypothesized. This doesn't seem huge, but its just silly that in a book about infinity, DFW states one of the most important undecidable hypotheses in all of math incorrectly and actually presents something that is easily provable (c=2^N0). Why not just one star? He did get me to read 100 pages..."
2,An unimpressive look at Infinity,"I was certainly looking forward to reading this book. While I haven't read any of the other books written by this author; his reputation preceeds him. Unfortunately, I was wholly unimpressed by his approach.I find the writing style very unnatural for mathematics. It can be difficult to follow the long, rambling sentences with his strange turns of phrase. While I can appreciate that this is modern writing, the style is inappropriate for the subject. Mathematics must be presented clearly and accurately. I left the book thinking that the author didn't understand the subject very well himself.It's an interesting topic and therefore there is something to be gained here. Sadly, there are much better alternatives to this one. If you have a mathematical background the book may irritate you with it's style. A pity though, it is a wonderfully rich and interesting subject."
1,Worst science writing I've seen,"Wallace should enroll in a writing class, or read other works of science writing, such as Charles Siefe's ""Zero: the biography of a dangerous idea,"" which covers much of the same ground. This book does contain a lot of information, but you need a clothespin on your nose to wade through page after page of bad (insecure, tendentious, immature) writing. Why did the publisher even print this pathetic work of supposed ""pop"" science? I plan to ask Amazon to let me return it."
2,Unreadable,"Wallace's obsessively detailed and digressive style makes this book unreadable. His work in general to me has the tone of an obsessive-compulsive Richard Linklater. I suspect he did not choose his style (which is common to the few things of his I've read) as much as it chose him. Looking back on Wallace's work after his suicide, it is tempting to see his style as a symptom of a troubled mind, though that is pure speculation. In any event, this book obscures its topic rather than revealing it. RIP."
1,Unreadable,"I could not read more than 50 pages of this self-indulgent, illiterate, incompetent mess before going into ""browse mode"". How did this get past the editors at Norton??"
1,Worst-written book I have ever read.,"I was expecting an exciting book.I was disappointed.This book has no chapters, lots of text message abbreviations, and many phrases ending in a period.Three-quarters of this book is background information.When the payoff comes, actually talking about infinities,the reationship among alelf null, cardinality c, and alef 1is left as a ""problem for the reader"" for 20 pages!"
3,Good content - poor style,"I liked the content of this book, but the authors style is pretty hard to come to terms with! My problem with it is the number of footnotes and parenthetical comments. It disrupts the flow of what is often an interesting discussion. It's a bit like having a very irritating companion constantly tapping you on the shoulder to interrupt you with his/her comments while you are trying to read. In the end I found the footnotes etc. so distracting that I simply ignored them - and I enjoyed the book a whole lot more. Some sensitive editing would make this book a much better read!"
4,my review for this book,"frankly speak, it is a very nice book and I am very enjoying reading this book. It not only offer me the history of the infinite, but also gave me a large amount of new knowledge which I do not know before. This book gave me a brand-new perspective to observe the infinite. I also like the writing style of the David Foster Wallace. It has very nice words and beautiful plots which can attract me to read it from the beginning to the end. By reading this book, it can also improve my reading skill because it has some very confusion words need me spend much time understanding. In addition, if you want to read and study from this book, you also need a certain level of mathematical sophistication, which would help you help understand the knowledge in the book easily. As a result, it is a very good book and it is exactly worth of reading."
3,"Arrrgh, Romanji!!","The extensive use of Romanji (Japanese words written using English/Roman characters, i.e. romanized Japanese) ruins it for any serious student of the language. If you just want to speak it and use it out of necessity, fine, but if you want to embrace and absorb the Japanese language, you are going to need to learn hiragana/katakana first (try Heisig's book Remembering the Hiragana). If you already know hiragana/katakana, then why are you bothering with romanji? Get a Kanji dictionary that doesn't have Romanji instead. Try Kodansha's Furigana dictionaries (they use hiragana/katakana to show you pronounciation instead of romanji).I know I sound like a fuddy-duddy and you're getting angry at me, but TRUST ME, if you avoid romanji while learning Japanese, it will save you so much blood, sweat and tears! You will thank me, I SWEAR it!"
4,Best Kanji dictionary I seen so far,"This book has all the kanji's and steps to write them. Once you learn the different ways to look it up, its almost impossible not to find the kanji your looking for. Its only down fall is that if you were looking for a kanji that was connected to a word of one of the kanjis your found, it doesnt tell you what page that kanji would be on, rather you have to start from scratch to find it that kanji. Its definitely worth it for those who are determined to learn japanese. recommended for intermediate to advance."
3,good for beginner-intermediate learners,"I have to give a tip of the hat to this dictionary for introducing me to the idea of character frequency; for beginning language students learning characters by rote, mastering them in the order of frequency seems to be the best way to go (there are quite a few joyo kanji that I almost never encounter). Or rather, learning them in that sequence worked best for me; focusing on high~frequency characters in the early stages of study is probably a good idea. Some of the definitions of compounds seem kind of vague/ambiguous (they are often esentially very broad lists of English~language synonyms, like some kind of bilingual thesaurus). The focus on the characters' ""meanings"" may annoy those who are themselves annoyed by the ideographic myth, but it sort of works as a mnemonic device (I guess).Ivan Rorick"
2,too limited,"Kodansha is the best, so we come to expect a higher level of quality in the material as well as a higher price. As a student, the number of Kodansha books that I can afford to keep on my shelves is quite limited; and in retrospect, this particular dictionary was a waste of money. The vocabulary is kept pretty small in order to make space for a more detailed description of each Kanji. This doesn't, however, present us with any real information that could not be obtained through other dicitonaries of a higher vocabulary. I would highly suggest instead the KODANSHA ESSENTIAL KANJI DICTIONARY, which I would personally not be able to live without."
3,Incredible,"Update: my review was based on a friend's copy [for sample pages, see [...]]. The copy I got from Amazon is terrible, pages are all yellow and paper is thin enough that you can see parts of the kanji from next page... really disappointed. I will update review with this pictures soon.I don't know what to say, this dictionary actually makes me want to learn Kanji. The definitions & detail, compounds, pronunciations and print quality are all top notch. I am comparing this to the set of dictionaries available on Kenkyusha online and I'm finding that this is a superior resource for the Kanjis it covers.One thing to note though, it doesn't give you sample sentences like Kenkyusha. Basically, the format is Kanji -> definition(s) with each definition(s) followed by compound words with other Kanjis."
4,It is what it is,"I was surprised how easy it was to look up words. Probably not reasonable to read anything of any length. It is a dictionary, what is to be said about it? It is what it is."
4,Really good,It's a great source for kanji. Just flipping to random pages is cool! The explanation of the character is done well. Only bad part: trying to find a specific kanji is really hard.
4,"The Kodansha, my review......",This is pretty helpful. You almost need to know a little Japanese before hand. It's extremely thorough.
4,Great guitar pedal,"I recently bought this guitar pedal its an overdrive effect, it sounds great with a marshall amp, it has a very nice distortion sound. Great ITem!! and it arrive just at the right time!!."
1,Good Construction Quality; lousy light,"If you need to find a keyhole in the dark, it's ok. Worthless otherwise. Very weak light. Disposable cigarette lighter lamps are brighter. You could enjoy a lifetime of sub quality light."
1,This is not the LED version of the Maglite Solitaire,"The specifications that Amazon listed for this Maglite Solitaire was that the ""Type of bulb"" was ""LED."" However, what I received in the mail was a normal Solitaire that had a the old-style incandescent bulb. I'm never buying this product again!"
5,"Great Gift, Great Quality, Fast Service",I certainly would recommend this product. This is a great stocking stuffer and the service and delivery was excellent. I hope it lasts like other maglites!
2,Gave up..,"This is my first exposure to any Lindsey writing and I just could not get myself into this novel and eventually just had to put the book down and move on. This novel is very wordy and (overly) researched and it takes a long time before you get into any of the action. As someone with very little experience/knowledge in the art business, I could not quite grasp the significance of the art in the novel nor could I really put myself into Harry's (the protagonist) situation.From what I've read, The Color of Night is a story of art dealer Harry Shroud and the scandal around the death of his wife, his new love Mara, and his art business.If you are in the art business or enjoy stories about art, perhaps you will enjoy this novel and it's depth. As for me, I could not get myself into this work."
3,"Good, but not up to Lindsey","As an avid David Lindsey reader, I must say that ""..Night"" had his usual wonderful characterization with deep Jungian shadows (!)and haute cuisine ecumenical tastes in food, location, architecture and women. However, this one fails at the denoument and ends with an uncharacteristically weak conclusion."
2,The book is wordy and rambling in style.,This book is laborious reading. It is much longer than necessary to handle the thin plot. The mix of characters with their 'in and out' appearances is disconcerting and only seems to add puff to the book.
3,A good read,"Lindsey has been better, but even a submaximum Lindsey is better than most others. The Color of Night is exciting, and you do become intricately involved with the characters. The plot line is intriguing but takes too long to conclude. Lindsey's writing, however, is good enough to move the reader through the slow parts. Not a one sitting book, but not one you'll never finish.http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/tiannei/"
5,Once again on top of his form,"After wandering away from Stewart Hayden mysteries and trying varying characters with varying degrees of success, Lindsey has finally (re)found the combination. Fast-paced, dark, superb. More along the lines, perhaps, of Ludlum than what we've come to expect from Lindsey, but it fits like a glove."
4,"A Better, More Interesting Spy Novel","A skilled Amazon reviewer gently chastised this book for lacking any of the cutting wit that this genre tends to carry forth. This lack is exactly what caused the novel and the characters to stand out for me. The Color Of Night was painted--not written and does not lack in action. The ""retired spy is drawn back into the fray"" formula is fresh again in this authors skilled hands. A truly enjoyable yarn."
2,"An art student's ""delight""-All others don't waste your money","A 496 page story that should have been written in 200 pages, so thin was the plot. The rest is just filler and garnish. Every time anything and I mean anything was about to happen in the book Linsay had to paint a canvas describing what the sun and the clouds were doing to the shadows and lighting which would have been fine had they had anything to do with the happening but they were just pulled up like a rabbit from a hat."
1,Multinational ultrasophisticated pretentious snore,"One of these where the author is so busy showing off all his research -- because his hero is an art dealer -- he forgets to inject the story with any juice whatsoever. The romance takes up a lot of space and is never jumpstarted, and the hero never seems credible as an ex-intelligence agent. The only books by Lindsey that are any good seem to be those that feature Stuart Haydon."
3,"A surprising, imaginative and great read","This book was given to me and I thought it was a refreshing crime/thriller because it does involve a variety of European and American locations and the art world. I am tired of heroes and warriors who know little outside their own city, though love them all the same. I thoroughly enjoyed it and looked for more Lindsey books, which seem to be quite different from this and perhaps not what I am looking for."
1,very disappointing.lindsey should return to his texas roots.,i have been an avid reader of lindsey since heat from another sun. a cold mind was superb and the dark underbelly of guatamala city in body of truth made for good social commentary as well as a nicely constucted thriller.Lindsey is now out of his milieu. obviously took a first cabin trip to europe on the proceeds of his earlier works. a conde nast guide to europe is no substitute for a convincing plot and real characters. i also have to say the three stooges look alike serbs were quite ridiculous. Mr lindsey should return to Houston immediately and base his next novel between bogota and oklahoma city. there is enough things going on in Tia Juana for 3 major novels. San Antonio would be a interesting study as i am sure Mr Lindsey knows full well.
4,EXCITING!!!,"Harry Stroud is trying to put behind his life as an American intelligence agent, while still mourning the death of his wife, when suddenly enters Mara Song, a beautiful woman with a deadly business proposition.After accepting Mara's propostion, Harry will be catapulted into the nightmare world he desperately is trying to escape. Then one day, Harry happens to find Mara with a video tape of his wife's final moments. As watching the tape, Harry knows who her killers are, and through a carefully orchestrated plan, Harry will make them pay...each and every one of them!'The Color Of Night' is a novel full of action, intrigue, and tricky plot twists to keep readers up all night.David Lindsey is among the best writers of action thrillers. His novels are always smooth, easy to read, guaranteed up-all-nighters that never disappoint. Mr. Lindsey has never been so prime for bestsellerdom as he is now, so do yourself a favor and read him, you will thoroughly entertained.Nick Gonnella"
1,A big step back,"Having read most of his earlier books, I was quite disappointed by this effort. It had a very thin plot and not much in the way of characters. All the jetting around Europe and name dropping hotels and restaurants is no substitute for a good plot. Where did those Serbs come from? That made no sense at all.Please Mr. Lindsey go back to Texas where you are on firmer ground. Better luck next time."
2,"A disconcerting, dumfounding mess","I discovered David Lindsey first in 'An Absence of Light' (hummm ... 'The Color of Night' ... 'An Absence of Light ... I should have guessed something was on the fritz here just from that). Backtracking from that first book, I read all his prior work and became a awed admirer of his unique ability to construct real lyricism from both the horrific and the mundane. Alas, however, everything since has been a stunning disappointment. 'The Color of Night' is a bit of a mess -- unfocused, overwritten, rambling, clumsy, and almost pointless in its core narrative line. Of course it's not nearly as awful a book as 'Requiem for a Glass Heart' was, but then nothing possibily could be. I really don't get it. Has the David Lindsay of 'Body of Truth', 'In the Lake of the Moon', 'Spiral' and 'Mercy' died, and a vastly less-talented imposter taken over writing under his name? You know, now that I think about it, I'd bet on it."
1,The Writing Is As Horrible as the Cliched Scenarios,"What a dissapointing, poorly written novel. The author has no grasp of subtlety, grammar, nuance or vocabulary. The dating scenarios are, a few times, mildly amusing, but the writing stifles any potential humour. The advice (read: platitudes) is not only cliched, but regressive, although if you are looking for dating advice from a woman who handles her life the way the author claims she does in this book, you are getting what you deserve. I wanted to love this book--I loved the series Miss Match which was based on this book--but it lacked originality, wit and intelligence. Read Darcy Cosper or Young Wives Tales instead."
5,"Interesting, enjoyable read","I picked this up on a lark and was very happy with it. It is an enjoyable read that will inform you on lots of interesting matchmaking techniques. If you ever want to see what goes on behind the scenes and want to see what makes people click, then this is the book for you.As someone who likes to play matchmaker for her friends I became very involved in the ""stories."""
3,"Entertaining, but...","Samantha Daniels's book is undoubtedly entertaining and a fast read; it also contains some useful if obvious advice, in the course of describing classic dating mistakes. But the author, in cavalierly declaring that men all require great looks and women all want lots of money, makes no allowances for the fact that her high-paying long-single clientele are liable to be more demanding than most on these points. Most of us in the real world are looking for a combination of moderate looks or security with someone who makes us feel comfortable and consistently loved. Also, I felt many times that this is not so much a book, as a book-length advertisement for both Samantha's dating service and for her own single self (in case any suitable bachelors are reading). It's ultimately quite annoying. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could."
1,The Author is Not Very Nice!,"I am sorry but I have not read this book nor would I. I had an opportunity to meet the author and all I can say is that she is a ROYAL BI@*H! I was extremely disappointed - she had such an ugly personality, I would be frightened to take her advice!"
4,Fun Book,"I read this book because I am also a matchmaker, however I work with the ""desperados"" in the City of Angles. I enjoyed reading about all of her clients, and totally related to all of the challenges she went through to match people. For everyone who is shocked that the men want hot hot hot and the women want rich rich rich, yes, it is all true. Coast to coast, when people hire a matchmaker, they are extremely selective and hoping to get everything they are dreaming of in a partner, even if it will only be in their dreams. I also enjoyed reading about how she started her business and tweaked it and made her rules along the way. I don't think we will ever get tired reading about the human species searching for their soul mates, we have to laugh at ourselves!"
2,Disapointed,"I was excited to get this book. I thought it would be a funny cute look at matchmaking but it wasn't. It mainly showcased alot of insecure, desperate clients and a picky matchmaker who says up front she isn't going to be a matchmaker for unattractive awkward people who haven't had a date in years. She instead chooses wealthy, neurotic, superficial new yorkers who order dates from her the same way you'd order a pizza. I felt as though everyone in the book including the writer had no depth or personality and that their biggest problem wasn't not being able to find a mate. It was not understanding what life is really all about."
5,I love chowder,"I love chowder. It's not likely for cartoon network to make a cartoon for older kids that isn't so gross, but l love it. And the kids find chowder hilarious. I recommend for kids ages 7 and up."
2,Where is the commentary?,"I love Chowder, but I wanted to watch the episodes with creator commentary!! Where is the commentary? Please add commentary!"
1,Worst cartoon ever!,"I don't see the attraction to Chowder. The main character is a hyperactive child with an obsession for eating. In our society that has problems with over eating and weight gain in our youth, this show particulary champions it!I could watch anything, but not this garbage!"
1,Chowder -- Not!!,"I could endure hours of crappy shows like Tele-tubbies, Dora the Explorer, and Barney the Dinosaur but not 10 minutes of that mind numbering show called ""Chowder"". So if you are into bathroom humor, insufferable characters, and dumb plot twists - Chowder is right up your alley . I'm hoping the show will be canceled soon...."
4,Alive in the Underground,"Early last year I was searching for heavy bands on myspace and what do you know I found Crematorium and I was not dissapointed. I chatted with them a bunch and found out that they were releasing a new album (The Process of Endtime), so I picked it up. I thought it was a good release, but it was very lacking in serveral ways (the drums for instance/repetitiveness), but with what The Process of Endtime lacked For all our Sins made up for. I can defintaley see how they got their label. This album is one of my favorite undergorund releases and (I'm not sure if they still have it on their site or not) they should have some live songs from this album on their site."
3,Pretty good,"This cd has plenty of aggression and attitude. I first saw crematorium back when they did a tour with Hoods and glass casket, i did some research on them before and went to that show solely because of my interest in crematorium.Despite them calling themselves 'murder-core' this cd is really good. A slight blend of death metal with hardcore influences, this cd is great to listen to every now and then."
4,music from the biggest voice in the underground,"Crematoriums latest release ""for all our sins""never promised to be an epic, this is an album that you can just kick back and party to.how ever...crematorium features frontman Dan Dismal who has made several contributions the south west metal underground as well as bands all over the world.If you are familiar with the California metal underground chances are you have met or dealt with Dan before, he has been helping bands with promotion as well as booking and other buisness matters since the early to mid 90'sand has worked with many of the major underground metal labels.I have this album just in admiration of the effort this band has put forth and look forward to buying the next release due out soon."
1,Boring,"I will start off to counter the other reviewer... This album is in No Way ""Black Metal without Keyboards"" why did he review it twice? is he in the band? The album was a major disappointment. Vocals are flat, the instrumentation is not varied and the drummer is weak. To say that death metal lacks talent? can this guy do 600 stroke per minute on double bass? 1000 stroke? How bout solos? nope... not on this album. Listen to Nile. Thatspounding death metal... with talent. Nothing interesting or innovative here.Black metal ... hahhahhhahahha what a joke."
5,Blew my mind,Absolutely remarkable. I'm glad I had my baseball mit on because I had to catch my brain after she blew it out of my head with her amazing album. Can't wait to see her in October!!!!
4,I'll pile on,"Dynamite for a first effort, she sounds like a mix of Tori Amos, Bjork and Joni Mitchell if I was forced to say something like that. Everything sounds great, she has a good ear and fine songwriting instincts to go along with her voice and musicianship. I don't like everything, she gets too cool chanteuse in places for my taste, like the first part of ""Human"" (which switches gears and gets neat at the end). ""What Me Worry"" edges into territory I don't like as well. I'll look forward to the next, kind of hopes she gets a little edgier and less jazzy, it would be really cool to hear what she sounded like with a techno edge."
3,Good but not great,I was blown away by the first track on this because of it's killer avant guitar but much of the rest sounds like standard 21st century singer/songwriter fare like you'd hear on a Target commercial. It's good but it doesn't live up to the promise of the first track.
4,Never played guitar before,"I think this is a great book for the absolute beginner. It covers all the basics for someone like me who is just starting...tuning, playing in different keys, strumming patterns, and keeping time, plus some worship songs to boot. I here there is a video that parallels this book that I plan on buying."
2,Too little technical information,"The book has a lot of photos, but when mention the examples of stadiuns do not inform techinical issues in detail. The information in the book about the cases or examples is not detalied and do not have a standart, like operational rates, traditional use, kind of costumers and rates of use."
1,Superficial,You go through the book and do not find the meat. It is more like a coffee table book. Not useful to mi as structural engineer.
4,STADIUMS,"Very good book on some spectacular sports stadiums. The text is very informative and the images are first rate. It is such a relief that stadiums are back to having style and not just totally utilitarian, like my beloved Astrodome. It is so sad to me that the Astrodome ushered in the multisport stadium, that type of stadium is almost extinct and the few that still stand like Houston's so called ""Eighth Wonder of the World"", linger like some sort of bad experiment that went horribly wrong. To appreciate how far stadium architecture has come, just look at Relient Stadium, which is profiled in this book, and compare it to the old grey lady next to her...the afore mentioned Astrodome....sic transic gloria."
5,Hidden Gems,"KMD's ""Mr.Hood"" was one of my favorite, and will always be. If this CD is not in your collection, get it now and you'll see! Even the first track ""Crackpot"" will offer better rhymes in it's first lines than most newbies on the scene today."
3,Second try gets better than the first,"The four-member team of commandos grows to five, by inclusion of the telepathic mammal named ""Bandit"". Sogan and Connor put to use their telepathic abilities for the protection of a human colony attacked by unknown forces. A fast-paced story, better than the first in the series.I would've liked to see less outdoor scenes and more human relationships - but you can't have them all."
2,Don't waste Your Money,The Product is probably durable if you could get it to slide down a steep hill. The Bottom is no where near slippery enough and the tube needs to be bigger so it stretches out the cover to make it a tighter fit. This is a horrible product as it WILL NOT SLIDE. I read one of the earlier reviews and thought maybe they were exagerating. I was wrong they if anything were too kind about how bad this thing goes. A huge waste of my money coulda had more fun throwing in the wind.
3,Doesn't slide well on the snow,"The shipper/manufactures was fine and this arrived quite quickly, the issue we have is with the actual product.The product itself is sturdy and holds up fine under use. The issue is that the outer cover, which protects the inflatable part, is not smooth enough so while it does slide down the hill, it does so quites l o w l y. We would suggest spraying the cover with Silicone Spray or some such to help it slide better on the snow."
2,paricon cyclone,"We bought this for our 8 year old daughter who spends lots of time sledding on our property. But she was disappointed to find out that it doesn't work well. It doesn't slide! It actually stops halfway down the hill because it goes so slow.....It needs a better ""slippery"" material."
1,One run and broken!,Went for a try and came back with a broken sled (hole on the side)after 10 minutes of sledding.Poor quality
4,great boots!,"These boots are great, I like them and people also, the only thing is that personally I like boots w/ opening on the side (zipper) so that is easier to tuck in your jeans, with these boots you almost have to have somone else pull them out. Overall they are great."
3,looks cheap,"They looks cheaper in person than on picture, and didnt fit that nicely (I have a bit bigger calves for a small person). Didnt take me long to figure out I needed to return them."
2,wow no,"the only thing that is good about this item .... is that it makes your hair dry, NOT STRAIGHT!!! my natural hair is curly and kind of puffy (well i think it is puffy my friends dont). So when i use this ""straightner"" it just dry's my hair for me and then i have to use my regular straightner."
4,A great deal,"As the other review stated there is only 1 rod, not 3. But the description never said it had 3 so the picture is just a little misleading.With that said it is a great kit! It has everything you need to clean your 40-45 pistol. The cleaning solution and lube go a long way since you don't need much. For under $20 this is the best kit I could find."
3,OK Book but not Excellent,"I give this book a grade C. It talks about the benefits of IMAP and about the most popular IMAP servers Cyrus-Imap and WU-IMAP. It shows an intro to both these servers but it does not go into technical details. I had to go to other sources in order to find out how to setup Cyrus IMAP properly and how to troubleshoot it. I wish they had a more recent Revision like the other O'Reilly books that are kept updated. There are a lot of differences between the IMAP servers of the year 2000 and the IMAP servers in 2006. I wish there was an O'Reilly technical book on just Cyrus-IMAP and anotherone for Dovecot-IMAP (my second choice for an IMAP server). Someone needs to write a new IMAP book, please!"
2,Light hearted view of the Kennedy sister-in-laws,"Jackie Ethel Joan is a light-hearted view of the three Kennedy sister-in-laws, their relationship with each other and the Kennedy family. The book also touches upon their roles in the political realm of the Kennedy world. This book is an entertaining read, but disappointing as a biography. The book is written in a very easy to understand and fun manner, yet the book has a slightly tabloid angle to it. While the book is titled ""Jackie Ethel Joan"" much more attention is focused toward Jackie than Ethel and Joan. Yet this is a good introduction to Ethel and Joan Kennedy's lives and their relationship to the rest of the Kennedy family. In all this book was an amusing and easy read."
4,DELICIOUS DISH DELICIOUSLY READ,"Just when we thought we knew all there was to know about the Kennedy clan Taraborrelli proves we didn't. Of course, much of what we now discover reads like a tabloid tell-all.These women had nothing in common save for their last name - soignee Jackie wasn't about to get on a touch football field with athletic Ethel. Shy, later alcoholic Joan, was sandwiched between the two of them.History? No. Tawdry tattled tales? Yes. If gossip is your meat, it doesn't get any juicier than this - deliciously read by Beth Fowler."
2,This is not a biography. It's fiction.,"Or maybe it's plagerism. I'm not quite sure which. But at any rate, Taraborelli has little integrity as a biographer. Yes, this book is entertaining. But it quotes detailed conversations neither the author nor his ""sources"" (many of whom are other tabloid writers or Kennedy hangers on) could have possibly known. Now for the theft -- I read Leamer's THE KENNEDY WOMEN, and recognized much of it here. So while this book is indeed a fun read, please don't take it seriously. I would have respected this entire endeavor more if it didn't pretend to be more than it was. Maybe, if it's ever reissued, the cover can be of Joan in a low bodice dress being ravaged by Teddy. Because that's all this book is -- a silly, fun, historical romance."
3,"A Page Turner, but Poorly Edited","This book was exactly what I needed for my beach vacation, a page turner that didn't require too much thought. It was very interesting and entertaining. However, it is very poorly edited, surprisingly so in that I bought the paperback edition. For example, the White House was misspelled in a footnote! In the last chapter, he mentioned twice in the same page that Jackie's last companion was a diamond merchant. This book needed a good editor... like Jackie!"
2,"Same old, same old","This book is a complete rehash. So what if the author quotes a lot of sources? The number of pages devoted to sources doesn't matter if the sources he used were lame sources, and a lot of them were. My favorite: the discredited secret service agents. How could the author presume to know the precise dialog spoken in a private conversation between Jackie and Bobby? Rather than reading this fanciful compilation of other books, your time would be better spent reading the other books,especially those by John Davis, a relative of Jackie's."
2,Nothing new here....,"I haven't read many books on the Kennedys, but there was little new and enlightening in this one. Aside from a few tidbits, much of this stuff has been rehashed in previous magazines, articles and books. This book was at its worst when the author tried to recreate conversations between the women and pass it off as actual truth. Some of the ""supposed"" conversations were almost laughable in their simplicity. A second-grader could have done a better job with the dialogue. Anyway, how does this author claim to know what happened during a private conversation between two people without any witnesses? Don't buy this book - if you really must read it, take it out of the library or borrow it from someone. It's much ado about nothing."
5,A great book on a cold winter day!,"My hairdresser recommended this book to me. I've read so much about the Kennedys that I almost skipped it. Am glad I didn't. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.There are a few new things and more details about other events. I particularly liked the parts about Joan. She's always been my favorite of them all. That Ted was so cruel to her is unforgivable. The Kennedy men come across as poor husband material!It was interesting to be reminded of these times again. I would recommend this book to anyone. These are three strong women."
2,Over-rated and Overpriced,"I have read any number of biographies about the Kennedys'and I found that this book simply rehashes information already written about them. I also found many inaccuracies. Having read the author's biography of Diana Ross, which I enjoyed very much, I was quite disappointed with this book. A better read on the topic of the Kennedy women is Laurence Leamer's The Kennedy Women."" Wait for the paperback version if you really must read it."
2,Wait for the book to get to second-hand book shops,"I saw this in our local bookstore for something like 399 Philippine pesos and I waited for five years to get it for a mere 20 pesos at a second-hand book shop. It was worth the wait because the book is a rehash of every other Kennedy biography. I have read plenty of Kennedy bios and when I read this book, I could practically identify from which book the information came from! The conversations Taraborrelli details here are so fake, so cloying. I find it unbearable when biographers ""imagine"" conversations. The only redeeming factor is that Jackie, Ethel and Joan are presented in a generally realistic light. Obviously the biographer tried to be unbiased. But other than that, this book is the cheapest way to go through other well-written Kennedy bios (such as the one by Collier and Horowitz)"
4,Interesting in a tabloid way,"I really enjoyed reading this book because I am fascinated by that time in our history and with Jackie Kennedy. I found this book to have an interesting point-of-view on all three Kennedy women. Ethel seemed to be easily envious or jealous but loyal and loving of her family. Jackie seemed to be snobby with a mind of her own, but again a deep loyalty for her family especially her immediate family. Joan seemed to be sad and a 'door mat' until she grew much older. She seemed to put up with the most crap and lost the most in return. I have no idea if any of what I read was accurate or not, but I liked reading it regardless. It was fun and fast in a very tabloid sort of way. If you're interested in the Kennedy women, then you'll probably like this book. The movie that was made based on this book is also pretty good, but naturally the book is by far better with more details."
4,An insightful look behind the scenes,"I found this to be a very intrigueing read, but the reader should have a working knowledge of the history, events and relationships that shaped the Kennedy dynasty because they are not going to be detailed in this book. In fact, some will be glossed over or entirely omitted. What you will read about is the experiences of those intimately involved in the events and tragedies: their personal thoughts, conversations and feelings, wrapped up in fierce political ambition and family loyalty.Even though I'm sure the conversations and personal information, albeit based on substantial research, has been ""developed"", anyone who has experienced a family death or misfortune will easily relate to the Kennedys' amazing ordeals, struggles and fortitude.I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,"Jackie Kennedy? HA, more like Jackie Collins or Susann.","What a load of garbage this book is...reshashed gossip, unsubstantiated rumors, ficticious dialogue, etc. The author has literally made up dialogue that he could never have found sources for and passed it of as what...history? biography? pyscological insight? Fooey! It's like the worst type of bad fiction imaginable. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
4,An In-depth look at all three Kennedy wives,"There are a million books on Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. This finally is a book that looks at Ethel and Joan also. They are very important in the careers of their husbands also, but lack the glamour and mystery of their sister in law. This book is a fine story of the three sisters in law and their relationships with each other, their families, the Kennedys, and the world. The book is very detailed and sometimes disorganized, but well worth reading."
2,Nothing New,After reading many articles on the Kennedy's throughout the years I really found nothing new in this book. It took me 3 months to get thru the book. Don't waste your money on this one!!!
1,Very Inaccurate,"Entertaining? Yes. However, especially with Jackie's oral history published, you can see how very historically inaccurate it is. If you want any semblance of facts, this isn't the book to read."
1,Not that Compelling,"For a book that boasts about newly revealed information about the elusive private lives of the Kennedy women, I was severely disappointed. Not only did the book repeat old information in a boring and scattered way, it also seemed to ""sugar-coat"" the information. I have read almost every book written about Jacqueline Kennedy and was unintrigued by this one and the ""details"" it presented. Another asecpt of the book that was flawed was the order that the information was arranged in. The problem is that there was no order, chronological or other. For any one wanting true insight into these women's fascinating lives, my recommendation is to look elsewhere."
5,"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!","Such fun! What a great book. Loved it. The writer made these women come to life for the first time, and not just superficially but with such amazing detail and vision. I couldn't resist it, even the gossipy parts. I heard that this is going to be an NBC miniseries in November. Now THAT should be fun!"
5,"Wonderful Jackie, Ethel, Joan","I read Lawrence Leamner's Kennedy Women book when it came out a few years back and found it to be dry and stale. It takes the women all the way back to the old country, so many female Kennedys I couldn't care less about in the early 1900s in Ireland. Who cares? This book focuses on the three I cared about the most, Jackie, Ethel and Joan. If you skim it, then you'll be confused about the dialogue. But if you read it carefully, you'll understand that the writer paints pictures and scenes rather than just quoting people dryly and boringly, as do most authors. I loved this book. Couldn't stop reading it. Don't miss it."
4,Good read!,Good read! I enjoyed readying the book. Brought the family to life for me and completed my perception of the ladies.
5,WHAT A HUGE SUPRISE,"Update the funk of the 70's, throw in a HENDRIX style guitar player of huge ability and VOILA you've got HIGH WIRE. The guitar playing is superb and shows the immense original talent ERNIE is. 11 of the 12 tunes are sensational and it is only LOVE SITUATION that I continuously have to skip. If you like original guitar tone and phrasing in an unusual musical format, don't hesitate, buy this cd now. A truely first class guitar cd from a surprising source."
4,Want More Ernie Isley guitar solos?,"I always loved the awesome guitar solo in Summer Breeze by the Isley Brothers, but most of the Isley Brothers music doesn't have big guitar solos. I searched for some solo work by their guitar player, Ernie Isley, and found this CD. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it a lot except one song. It has the feel of the 1970s but still works today. There are plenty of guitar solos and Ernie, who does all the singing and instrumentation, did a great job. I would recommend if you like the style after listening to music samples for this CD."
4,"You want to hear some licks, it's on this album.","I bought this album way back when this was first released. I had just seen Ernie playing with Letterman's band on his old show on NBC. He was wicked with his axe. His tone is distinctly his own. So I bought the cassette. I played it for my friend on a road trip and it blew his mind. There are a couple of rockers where Ernie lets loose, but, for the most part the music is more subtle. This isn't a Classic, but, there isn't a bad song on the album. This album is a testament of one of the great guitarist showing off his licks his own way. This isn't an Isley Brother's record, it's all Ernie. After hearing this though, you'll never listen to another Isley Brothers record without noticing how good he plays the guitar. Four star was what Rolling Stone gave this album. That's about right."
3,cold and boring,"The set up of this story is great and has all the makings of a good read but somehow falls short in the creative writing department. Characters are shallow and not developed, the wording repeats itself over and over - the text just begs for something really interesting to bite into. Good idea for a story but lacks in literary development and interest. After treking along with these characters for the entire book, the last chapter just ends with no explanation - it just stops and the book is over."
5,"catchy tracks, ultra smooth and soulful pipes","catchy tracks, ultra smooth and soulful. alot of talent for such a young artist. my favs are ""way I feel"", ""too hott"". i feel her heart & soul, wanna hear more.... it's not just great tracks, she has an awesome voice, the kinda voice you wanna just keep listening to."
5,Still didn't buy this?,Just finished listening to this again tonight. Probably the best of my 500 CD's. What an excellent job re mastering in stereo.
3,Highly repetative - mildy interesting.,"Unlike Redfields previous two books, The Secret of Shambhala was more of the same, told in every angle, for 250 pages.The dialogue between the characters was very basic and they lacked any depth in personality. Throughout the book, redfield merely walked his characters to new locations, rehashed what needed to be learned in order to ""proceed"" and occasionally attempted to mix things up with an already overused (in the celestine prophecy and 10th insight) chase by goverment officials, resulting in a highly anti climatic end where the main character finds shambhala.Although Redfield conveyed some interesting themes, such as prayer fields, he could have done so in a more origional and interesting fashion.I would only reccomend this book if you have read Redfields previous two books and dont mind his repetative style of writing."
3,A bit disappointed,"From reading ""The Tenth Insight"" I was very eager to continue the series with ""The Secret of Shambhala"". I built up an expectation from the prior books that this book would be even better because I thought ""The Tenth Insight"" was much better than ""The Celestine Prophecy"". Again Redfield went back to his repetitive writing. If he cut out all the parts he repeated I think the book would be 3/4 the length. I found this book to be mediocre and it does not dwell on the questions we have. I felt that it is was merely a fiction as where I found it, in the fiction section."
2,Disappointed,"The original CELESTINE PROPHECSY was successful in part because of its freshness. While Mr. Redfield's core ideas: synchronicity, energy fields, and the spiritual evolution of the planet, were in themselves hardly original, he presented them in an appealing new way that had resonance for contemporary readers. His sequels, however, especially this one, have been disappointments because his thinking has hardened into a kind of repetitive ideology. There's still some compelling material here underlying all this, but Mr. Redfield needs to take a break to get back in touch with it"
3,Reads like a Nancy Drew novel,"I do like James Redfield. I have read his other books, and gotten the main points, but that is the problem. They are all alike and you can predict the style and what is coming next. Remember good old Nancy Drew? The Clue in The Old Clock, The Secret of the Hidden Staircase? Find a clue, go to the next place. Go ahead and buy it if you havent read his other books. He still has a beautiful message."
3,A good sandwich with bad bread,"Shambhala is like a good sandwich with two pieces of bad bread holding it together. It took quite a while to read through what I thought was a slow beginning, then it took off and became really exciting, only to finish with a very weak ending.I love Redfield, and will read everything he writes, but this one could have been a lot better."
2,Mindfulness lite !,"Tibetan Buddhism meets Srar Trek....The first few chapters had me going and I thought this would be as close this genre gets to a page-turner. Then came the corny ""beam me up"" ending and I was completely let down....As much as I tried to keep my ""prayer field"" charged I couldn't bounce back from the very weak close.Those like myself trying to balance skepticism of this genre with a true desire to understand spiritual strength will only find this as further evidence that soul searching pablum not only sells but apparently changes peoples' lives.If you're looking for Buddhist thought and eastern philosophy applied to broader ecumenical spirituality and dogma, you can do a LOT better than this.I can't help but to believe that Redfield rested on his previous laurels on this one..."
2,Shambhala Shambles,"I had reservations about Redfield's Celestine Prophecy, so didn't bother with The Tenth Insight. But having some experience with Shambala (note spelling), decided to give The Secret of Shambhala a try. Sorry, but it seems to me to be made up partly of some genuine worthwhile knowledge (which, however, is pretty common knowledge anyway)and partly--or mostly--of a humonguous bunch of buzzwords and buzz concepts--a lot of New Age-type stuff. A very thin read, and Redfield's style is basic English, which I suspect is used to facilitate quick translation in ""the world's languages,"" but which I find most offputting in what purports (I think) to be a serious work. I had hoped to find a connection in this book, but quickly came to the conclusion that Redfield's Shambhala truly is pure fiction."
2,Great Read,This book was amazingly insightful and I keep it as a reference. It is a must read for those on a spiritual journey.
5,FOR ADVANCED SEEKERS- DEEP MEANINGS TO EXPLORE,"This is both timeless and timely on all levels. This book opens heart and mind to the true adventure we are experiencing on earth. Live the lessons and you will enjoy a full life continously unfolding. The journey is the journey. Again as in his first two books Redfield is ahead of his time. The wisdoms, insights and teaching back up and illuminate the experiences and information that has been coming through about ourselves and the earth in this time."
2,Little far fetched?,"Unlike other James Redfield Books, this book is bordering on pure fiction or fantasy. This book necessiates your lgic and reasoning power to be supressed most of the times.I feel that creation energy centres which the auhor envisages, is unimaginable for ordinary or even to readers who are familiar and advanced spiritual explorers."
2,Labtec LVA-7330 Clearvoice,"This is a mike to be used with a computer for voice recognition etc. It does not work for a PA system, like I hoped it would. I tried to use it with my Behringer EPA40 PA System but no sound comes out. None of the headset I tried works for this purpose,so I must use the hand held mike that came with the PA system."
5,Great classic still of importance,"I read this as an undergraduate in the late 1960s. It's one of those books that I still remember, and I've been thinking of having my students today read it. It was written at a time when abortion, homosexuality, and drug use were all illegal, and makes a plea for legalization. I think people could benefit from looking at an analysis of these issues in a time of criminalization--such as some would have us return to."
4,A Good Time,"There is nothing musically profound about this disk. None of the musicians are big names. But I must confess that this CD won me over, because listening to it reminds me of how pleasant it is to hear music done well even if it is not original or profound. Joe Augustine is a pianist who on this recording leads a standard jazz quartet comprising piano, bass, saxophone, and drums. Most of the tunes are covers, with a few originals thrown in. Picture yourself at a good restaurant, enjoying a satisfying meal, and then a local jazz quartet sets up in the corner and begins to play. The tunes are familiar, the musicians are good, and everybody has a good time. There is something to be said for that kind of musical performance, and this CD captures that mood exactly. It may not be profound, but it surely is enjoyable."
5,Clarinet Book,Great service!This is the book I needed. Excellent service. Just what I needed for my students.I will order from them again.
3,Forgotten history,"My name is Maelle and I am in 4 th grade. This was a fun book and I really enjoyed it because it was presented in an easy way to learn and understand how some civilisations lived in the old old days, not the usual way of sometimes boring history books. This book make me want to learn more details about the Vikings."
1,I get it. I'll buy an index fund.,"Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds. I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much. If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book."
5,a must read for investors,"This is by far the best investment book I have ever read. The analyses are brilliant,Mr. Bogle pulls back the curtain on the mutual fund industry."
2,"Common Sense, Yes -- Plain English, No","This book struck me as an academic and unnecessarily complicated version of Eric Tyson's ""Mutual Funds for Dummies"". Both books recommend a common sense (and increasingly common) approach to investing that stresses the importance of long-term horizons, low expenses, and minimal turnover. The difference is that Bogle cloaks his ""thesis"" in so much jargon and gobbledy-gook that it often takes a couple readings just to figure out what he's trying to say. He's kidding himself if he thinks Main Street USA is going to get through this book. If his intent was to shake up American complacency a la Thomas Paine, I'm afraid he's failed miserably.By the way, the book's jacket and first few pages are loaded with hyperactive rave reviews from some Big Names in the investment field. This seems awfully disingenuous when Bogle thanks almost all of them by name a couple pages later in the Acknowledgments section. Logrolling, anyone?"
3,"Repetitive, Common Knowledge","He just sells one point in the book:""Buy low cost Index funds.""And he supports it with examples and historical analysis. But completely disregards the fact that actively managed funds can beat the index in bull market and good managers have a track record on not nose diving in bear market. So low cost and diversification should be a high priority, good management and strategy are also equally important. You don't have to always follow the index, people do outperform it in long term with low cost. The catch is P/E ratio."
3,"A good argument for investing in low cost, index funds.","This book provides a good argument for buying low cost, index funds for the average investor. Each chapter provides evidence on why index funds should be a major part of one's portfolio. The book details how cost is a large factor in reducing returns. He presents the data very well, however each chapter is just another detailed argument on why one should buy low cost, index funds. After the first few chapters this gets a bit tiresome. Mr. Bogle's first book was much more informative on how to design a well rounded portfolio."
5,A classic!,"""Bogle on Mutual Funds"" was my first investment Bible. This book kicks it up a notch in sophistication of his philosophy. Noone knows what will work best in the investment world next year, but Bogle clearly knows what will work best over the long run. IGNORE THIS BOOK AT YOUR PERIL! The last third of the book is an extremely brave look at the business morals of the mutual fund industry. Thank God somebody is willing to speak up."
4,Bogle is Required Reading,"Bogle, Bob Brinker, and Jane Bryant Quinn sold me on the idea of index funds. There are some who believe you need to stick to actively managed funds to, as one money manager told me, ""be there to steer the plane away from the mountain at the last minute."" Hogwash, especially when you consider a lot of blend funds have 95 percent the same allocations as comparable index funds, only you pay the higher expense ratios.I've done very well with index funds covering the S&P; 500, as well as the European and Pacific markets. I'm just now breaking into the index fund's conceptual spawn, the ETF.One complaint: the book is indeed repetitive. The major selling points (e.g., expense ratios, tax efficiency, market allocations, etc.) could have been stated as well with half the text. It's also a somewhat tedious read, but still worthwhile. (I'm a CFP in training.)"
3,RS 400 SD,"I find this product to be an excellent tool for keeping track of my workouts. The one complaint I have is that there seems to be a glitch with transfering information to my desktop; I find that I often have to close the Polar program and reopen it in order to get the transfer to work. Other than that it's easy to use and very sturdy. The footpod has been accurate and, although it can be difficult to attach to my shoe, it has held up very well to trail runs, stream crossings and muddy days."
1,Desepci√≥n total,"Compr√© este reloj pensando que era lo mejor que hab√≠a en el mercado para corredores, cual fue mi sorpresa, llevo 5 cambios de correa, se rompen muy seguido, el boton de Inicio (rojo) continuamente deja de funcionar, le tengo que cabiar el ""esqueleto"", adem√°s de que el footpod no marca la distancia con presici√≥n, nunca volver√© a comprar un Polar...."
4,Great item!,"Like the features of the watch. It helps me track my pace, distance, HR and time of my daily run. I like also the pro-trainer software included in the package. Only thing don't like is the ""bulky"" foot pad."
2,I'd do some research first,"I don't have this particular watch, but am very frustrated with the Polar watch I do have. The IRDA device used to upload data to the computer doesn't seem to work.. or perhaps it is the watch that doesn't work. I even went so far as to buy an 3rd party IRDA which some people have gotten to work with their watches (needs to be one with IRDA compatability). But, it hasn't worked for me, even though I can transfer documents from a PDA to my laptop. If transferring data to your computer is important, I suggest going to the Polar website and puruse their user forums. There is no shortage of people complaining about data transfer problems. Make sure that whatever product you buy actually has the fewest complaints on data transfer. Me, I've wasted too much time on this, I'm buying a Garmin instead."
2,"Really, That's It?","With no other information preceding this release, one would have thought they would come up with the entire Swedish Radio performance. The two stars are for the 'record company'. Robin deserves better than this, as do us fans."
4,Not coffee,"Well,the service of the merchant was very good.In addition to the guitar, there was a gig bag,pitch pipe,two plucks,additional E,B strings and a complete set of extra strings.The guitar was more of reddish color than described as coffee.the strings became very taut when i tried to tune it in accordance with the pitch pipe. so i had to tune them one scale lower and it took me hardly 5 minutes to tune it and when i played it, i just loved it. the sound was definitely good.and it was very comfortable to hold it too.the appearance is pretty decent looking.the finish on the fretboard seems like whoever painted it was in a bit of an urgency.the varnish coats were smudged at joints and thats why it looked like a medium order guitar.no more reasons for my four stars.overall, a good product for the price and i was lucky it was handled and shipped properly.intermediate players and beginners will love it."
3,Accoustic guitar,On the picture the guitar looked different in shape than what was actually sent to us. It would help if the company could add the electronic tuner as a new guitar needs very frequent adjustments.
1,Dangerous!!!!,"Oh. My. Gosh. Not only was the guitar I received completely different in shape and color than the one I ordered, but it looked extremely rickety and almost as if it had been roughly treated by a previous owner -- and I purchased it NEW. I flipped it over to inspect the back of it, and discovered a ""Made In China"" sticker which explained it all... I know it is an inexpensive guitar, and I wasn't looking for a miracle, but I expected it to at least be true to what I ordered... Furthermore, when I tried to tune it, the bridge made this horrible and scary cracking sound -- and it wasn't even in tune yet!!! I promptly flipped it over (so it wouldn't snap a steel string and BLIND me), loosened the strings and put it back in the box and asked for a REFUND."
4,Wonderful!,I really like this item! I bought it in November and used it all through the holidays for entertaining. You can't beat the price or the quality. I am also happy to have 2 - 24 mini muffins in one pan instead of using 4 - 12 mini muffins pans all over the place. Great buy!
5,Changed my life.,I found this wonderful book back in the early 1980's after reading it my life changed. I read the book over and over using all of her suggestions. I overcame my agoraphobia and now lead a normal life. I recommend this book to all who suffer from this condition. It is simple and easy to understand and follow. Linda
5,Still solid self-help,"I read this book 20 plus years ago. It is from the seventies, I believe. Great cognitive psychology for panic disorder and agorphobia. Provides self-help basics and practice for desensitization. I bought It for another; I was really glad to find it on Amazon."
4,"Pretty patterns, but not very many of them.","There are some pretty patterns in this book, the best ones are pictured on the cover. All of them are in worsted or bulky weight yarn, and there is a little note on combining strands of thinner yarn to make different weight substitutions. It is mostly tops & sweaters, with a few ponchos. I did not pay much for it, so I am happy with it, but glad I didn't pay a whole lot of money, since there are several patterns I won't be making."
5,Exquisite,"This book has the most exquisite photography and a very, very nice assortment of patterns."
3,Mediocre,"I had one of these toys as a child and I remember it being made a lot better than this one. This one works, but is flimsy. The plastic that keeps the bars spaced apart slides up and down, allowing the tip to widen too much to hold the gyro. If the plastic is slid too far toward the opening angles, the gyro can't pass through the angles. It works for adults and older kids, but will fall apart with younger children."
3,Uncle Spinny Dervish!,"Uncle Spinny Dervish!""They used to call this an uncle spinny dervish""""An uncle spinny dervish?""""I dunno I'm just bored"""
1,Will not buy again,"Did not work like they did years ago, the wheel would go wobbly and not stay on the handle ."
4,"something for the ""office toy box""","The product seems and feels sturdy at first glance and feel. Something one would not expect for the price. The wheel itself does not have a stable look to it. It will probably break after beeing thrown to the ground 5 or 6 times. It is great to give to people to get their minds of things. I personally like it and pick it up from the ""office toy box"" to play with it from time to time. It is also nice for explaining friction and magnetic forces to the little ones. As it stops from tilting at a certain speed, one could also explain the principle of the gyroscope and thus the rotational energy. I would say the longelivity of the thing greatly increases with children over 9. Bottom line is that its very good value for the price and fun to play around with(but probably not more than 5 minutes a week)."
3,Exploitative argument,"He includes discussion of: Sex: Marriage and Divorce; Women in the Church; and Christians and the governing authorities. He discusses homosexuality on p. 52 to 82. There is a brief discussion of Sodom, Gibeah and sodomy. When he comes to Paul he is mostly using the exploitive argument used by Scroggs in much more detail. The fact that Paul describes the Rom 1 men as ""consumed with passion for one another"" and ""receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error"", plus the fact that Paul includes lesbians (their sex was not exploitative), indicates that Paul is not describing the exploitative side per se. Furnish is certainly useful on the history of homosexuality in Paul's world. He is easy reading and the article would be useful for those who want to know more about homosexuality in Paul's time, although I think that Scroggs (New Testament and Homosexuality) is the better buy, if you are only interested in the section on homosexuality"
5,An Excelent Dictionary,"If you are looking for an Arabic - English Dictionary, this is the one. You have to be somehow proficient in Arabic to find the root of the word, once you have found it, this dictionary will give you a myriad of examples of the specific term."
5,Great for Arabic to English translation.,"This book is arranged by three letter stem and not according to the first letter, which is both its strength and weakness. If you are completely new to Arabic, and have no idea what stems or roots are, this book is going to be confusing, and if you are trying to translate from English to Arabic, this book is going to be worthless. Those two potential problems aside, it is much better organized and presented than the Wortabet-Porter dictionary."
5,I have the hardcover edition of this book.,"it is indispensable!!!I purchased this book while studying Modern Standard Arabic abroad at the American University in Cairo Egypt. This dictionary helped make it possible for me to write poetry after about three months. This is an ""Arabic to English"" dictionary, so you must be able to read Arabic to use it. You should be able to use it once you have learned the alphabet. It is far better and more accurate than an ""English to Arabic"" one of which I have many and find utterly useless. My instructor Miriam recommended Hans Wehr, and it is the best tool I have invested in to date. I have not seen this version before, but I would agree that in this case bigger print is better, so if it is possible to do so - go ahead and invest in the hardcover edition."
2,"Purchase Awde & Smith's ""Arabic: Practical Dictionary"" instead!","The book is not worth it's price. The words seem to be in some type of unique order, so in order to find a word one must search over about 10 pages. Does not list many of the words I have tried looking up. I purchased N. Awde & K. Smith's ""Arabic: Practical Dictionary,"" which is Arabic to English AND English to Arabic, which Wehr's is not. Too expensive and isn't as useful as I thought it would be!"
2,Extremely small,Wow. This book is TINY. I have good vision but even this was a struggle to read at times. Dictionaries shouldn't be this small. I would urge you to buy the larger version instead. It's easier to navigate.
3,Standard Dictionary,"Hans Wehr is the most standard dictionary that you can get, and it will likely be required when you study Arabic. There are great online tools, as well that can help you in your Arabic studies."
2,"Very tiny font, difficult to read and use for a non-arabic person","I am trying to learn arabic and from student perspective it is very difficult to use such a dictionary since the fonts are very very small. You will need a microscope to read without straining your eyes. It may be a good dictionary for people who speaks Arabic, but for me ....."
5,outstanding arabic dictionary,The Hans Wehr dictionary is a very good dictionary.It let's you know the root word and alphabets to help make it more understandable for the person to find the answers he/she needs.
1,Give me a break!!!,"So let me get this strait. It's God's will that Christians be wealthy and blessed all the time? Didn't Jesus Christ himself say that's hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven (Luke 18:24) and in Matthew 6:19 didn't he say not to lay up for yourselves treasures on earth but rather lay up treasure in heaven? It seems like God must have changed his mind. I think between the author's message and Jesus' message I'll go with Jesus. This kind of teaching that the author is trying to put over as Christian doctrine is nothing more than materialism and can be summed up by quoting 1st Timothy 6:10 ""For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."" My advice to the author is this. Spend more time reading what Jesus actually said and less time trying to sell books."
1,Trouble in River City,"The character of a well-known musical, fast-talking salesman ""Professor"" Harold Hill, arrives in the little Iowa town of River City with a classic ""con."" The author of How To Live Like a King's Kid, a spiritual con man of the same name, tries to sell a twisted doctrine of ""Blab It and Grab It"" nonsense with the same slick style. Deny yourself and follow Christ? No, according to Harold Hill. He teaches that God wants us to be self-consumed with aquiring lavish goodies for our comfort and ease. It is not about taking up the Cross and serving others; instead, it is about ""Health and Wealth"" if we will just ""Name It and Claim It"". How sick!"
5,GAVE ME CHILLS!,"I am typically not a reader, but a friend insisted i read this book. I can not put down! It is filled w/ the Spirit!Im buying my own copy to pass down & use to witness God's Love/Power. I find I am using parts of this book in my daily life. I give all Glory To My Father IN Heaven! Thankyou Father for using the author of this book to tell the world how Awesome You are!"
3,"Inspirational tales, but I'm dubious...","First off, any reprint of this book has the moral obligation to note that the Joshua's Missing Day chapter has been pretty well refuted. Perhaps Hill was told this & believed it himself. Perhaps he made it up. I don't know. This book was a big seller in Charismatic circles in the 1970's, and in fact inspired my own search into the Charismatic Renewal. I'm still Charismatic (AoG member) but an increasingly skeptical one when it comes to outlandish claims & extra-Biblical teachings. I hope Hill was not fabricating stuff, but even if he did experience everything in the book, it does not validate the Prosperity message his books teach. It only validates the grace of God through Jesus Christ."
3,Not solid enough,"I purchased this turner a while ago, I don't use it too frequently because it's a little too floppy not solid enough for cooking certain things."
2,This spatula is huge,I had no idea it was as big and bulky as it was when I ordered it. This product is not well suited for scrambled eggs or even over easy eggs but probably would flip pancakes or grilled cheese sandwiches with no problem.The handle and blade are much thicker than most spatulas I've used. Personally I'd prefer a lightweight flexible thin bladed spatula for use in curved walled skillets. This type is best suited for larger square frying pans.
5,Richard Norton in First Rate Action Pic!,"""Nautilus"" begins at a swift and entertaining pace in a moody South American setting where the film's hero, portrayed by Richard Norton with his dependable excellence, eludes his opponents down the corridors of a crumbling hotel. The scenemixes a comedic tone with action -- not always a successfulcombination in the hands of lesser actors. Norton strikes his marks and the fun never lets up as the plot moves into a futuristic world of time travel aboard the high seas. With his able supporting cast, Norton and company make the film a first rate adventure. It is a DVD that action fans will want to own!"
2,I only gave it 2 stars because its at least a SCI FI movie,"I have to give this movie a big thumbs down. It was lacked the technology that it should have had. The Port hole that was the ""Main Viewer"" for the Nautilus was opened by Hand using a hand crank of some sort which I thought was hilarious that a submarine that could travel thru time would have something that had to be operated by hand...Many other flaws but I will let you decide..I am a Sci-Fi fan so I gave it 2 stars"
4,An entertaining trip down memory lane.,"I remember reading some of these comics way back in the mid 70's. It was nice to re-visit some of my memories from 30 years ago. The art by Wrightson was fantastic! I give it my highest recommendation. The stories by Wein were why this graphic novel got four stars instead of five. The stories were competent but still had plot inconsistencies and pacing problems. I found the stories to be a little to hokey and fake at times - even for a comic book. All in all it was worth the money, four stars out of five usually is."
1,Dumb da dumb dumb...DUMB!,"Don't waste your time with this book. I agree with the person who said they thought the reviews were fake...no one in their right mind would say this was great, funny etc. If you're looking for something entertaining that's a great read pick up My Horizontal Life...it was written by a comedian about her sex life and is hilarious. The next time you read a review that says a psychologist from the armpit of the US wrote a funny book please beware. The book however, did make for good kindling :)"
3,"Decenlty funny, entertaining","I feel the book is not completely professional material and is written from the viewpoints of 2 grown, educated women and their experiences in the dating realm. This is over and above many gramatical errors, format, and layout errors (which should have been caught by the publisher).It is funny and entertaining but I would not hold this book, or many focused on dating, as gospel.The book does offer some tips and hints toward some viewpoints of men and our faults, which is a good help to those who need it. Or you could take the other viewpoint: Tips on how to lose a girl on the first date."
4,"It's not Perfect, but it's not horrible either.","I thought the book was a quick pleasant read. If nothing else, I felt in the company of familiar situations and humorous outcomes. Helene and Gwen are good sports. Buy it, read it, enjoy it--it's 220 pages of pure sitcom humor. If it was a show i'd watch it."
1,Please do not waste your time or money.,"What to do when you've fallen for a jerk but you want to make it work? You hit yourself over the head, come to your senses and dump him. See? That didn't cost you a thing!This woman doesn't have enough sense to NOT be on a ridiculous TV show, why would you pay money to read her book?"
4,"Okay book, but she's not a psychologist","Okay, It's a funny book. It's a worthwhile read for an easy laugh. But this woman, Helene, is not a psychologist!!! In order to be a psychologist one needs a Ph.D. She has a masters degree, I think, maybe not even that. But at that, please stop giving her props for something she is so not!!! Just a little education people. Some of us have worked a long time to be a real psychologist!!!"
3,Bishop deconstructs deconstruction,"This one jumped off the shelf and into my hands. I'm a Bishop fan from years back--having read and loved books like Ancient of Days, No Enemy But Time, The Secret Ascension (aka Philip K. Dick is Dead, Alas), and Unicorn Mountain--and I hadn't even known that he had a new book coming out.Not only that, but a book that really piqued my interest. Bishop's doing his own version of Watchmen here--what if a ""superhero"" really existed in our world. But the operative word on the title page is that this is a comedy. For all his realism, Bishop is actually writing in the tradition of James Branch Cabell and Thorne Smith, warping our reality to actually satirize it.It has confirmed my expectations. Xavier Thaxton is the Fine Arts editor at the local newspaper--a man who hates popular culture. But slowly he finds that popular culture is what he needs, and what he is becoming. The conclusion is a statement about ""art,"" that most nebulous of terms."
2,Three Steps Forward Two Steps Back,I like the book but got an older copy of the book not the cover I ordered. First time this has happened. Still reading the book but do like it very much. Just wish it was an updated copy.
3,Would be worth five stars. . .,"but I've come to expect more from Swindoll than this. Good material, well presented. But I have come to expect Swindoll to be transcendently insightful, and he isn't here."
2,Educational Assessment of Students (5th Edition),Uggg... A need for the degree.... oh well. The good news is that I got it quickly and for a goood price and it will be on sale again in a few weeks.... wanna buy it? :0
5,Great! Thank you!,Received on time and book was exactly as expected. No problems with this seller. Thank you for your promptness. Greatly appreciated!
3,Good quality,"shipment arrived in reasonable amount of time. they were not as heavy as the cookie sheets i have now, but they're still much better than most you can buy in discount stores."
4,Irresistible You (4.5++),"Bravo to Celeste O. Norfleet. Like all the previous books in the Mama Lou Series, this book is a wonderful read.J.T. is a successful CEO who is not only a workaholic, but also a true playboy who never intends to settle down. During a New York City blackout, he has a passionate encounter with ballerina Juliet Bridges. What was intended to be a one night stand is now becoming an obsession. Like several of his friends and family members he is afraid of Mama Lou's matching schemes and attempts to avoid her. Little does he know both he and Mama Lou have the same person in mind as his perfect match.I have read every book in this series and I love them all. Passionate, drama filled, funny and well written this book is worth a spot on your shelf."
5,Love found its way to their hearts....,"I'm a die-hard fan of Ms. Norfleet. I've read all her books and this was the third installment of her Mamma Lou series, featuring J.T. and Juliet. You must read the books before this one ""Priceless Gift"" and ""One Sure Thing"" and after it ""The Fine Art of Love."" All are a part of the Mamma Lou series.All I can say is that this book made me go back and dig out my old ""Earth Wind and Fire"" songs and play ""Love's Holiday"", which was the song J.T. was singing when Juliet truly discovered she fell in love with him.The love scenes were just as I like them: hot, passionate and unforgettable. I won't say anymore for fear of taking away the enjoyment you will get when you read this book. Buy it, read it, savor it!"
3,3.5 stars,this was my first book by this author and it just might be my last.It had a good story line and well developed chacters but it took too long to get interesting.In the start of the book the scences are too drawn out and overly descriptive.I had to force myslef to keep reading.But it did finally get better around page 110.Not a terrible read but not nearly a great read.
2,Okay Read,"I have read other books by this author and liked them but I must say the atrocious editing in this book was so distracting to me it took away from the storyline. There are misused words, misspellings and wrong tenses used throughout the book that made me grit my teeth in frustration."
2,"Oops, I'd like to correct my earlier review-submittal","It was the Rough Guide Dutch dictionary and phrasebook I bought to replace the Berlitz phrasebook, not the Lonely Planet."
5,WOW Finally Found It!!!!,"I've searched high and low for almost two years! And thought it was a mistake when I found it here on Amazon US. I thought for sure I'd get an email saying ""sorry, we couldn't locate this item"". Nope, it shipped!!! Thank you so much Amazon!This is the one and only Drama CD to the series Simoun. It focuses on what would happen should the Sibylla be transported to modern day Tokyo. I just felt my collection was incomplete without it. And I'm very happy to finally have it!"
5,Greek Mythology and more,"My son, just 9, loves all the Papo figures and weapons. They are well-built and very accurately detailed toys. When we study an epoch (like Medieval times or in this case Greek Mythology) I reward my son with figures that capture the spirit of the time. He has knights and dragons to create battles along with battering rams and . And now he has a really cool minotaur with which to populate his own giant lego maze. He has hours and hours of fun with these and never has had a broken piece."
5,Awesome!,These toys are so authentic and life like. They bring mythology to life. My son is collecting them all! Very sturdy and great action figures for kids of all ages.
5,I love Tommy Denander records!,"Well, here we go again. Tommy Denander has created another excellent album of melodic rock songs with an edge. His awesome and clear production style is intact along with all the great guitar playing we have come to expect. The vocals by Frederikson are also very smooth and powerful giving the whole album that melodic touch reminiscent of his work on Toto's ""Isolation"" album. All the songs have sing-along potential which is always important in any melodic rock release! Fans of Toto's early work will be in melodic rock heaven while new fans will love the technical guitar work on show and the tight production used by Denander. Highly recommended to fans of this genre and definitely one of the best albums this year."
5,Outstanding album!,"A terrific album! Fergie and Denander have great talent and I very much enjoy their work, love it. The vocals are outstanding, of course, it's Fergie! The instrumentalists are great. What else can I say. When it's Fergie/Denander the work is guaranteed to be great!"
1,Incorrect Item #,I tried twice with this company to get a passenger side interior door handle for a 1999 Toyota Tacoma and both times they sent me a drivers side door handle. I even called them to help them with selecting the right item and nothing changed. Item # 77121 is not a passenger side interior door handle. Drivers side does not work on passengers side. I eventually had to go to Toyota aand pay $30 for something I should be able to get from Amazon for $6-$8. Now they expect me to go out my way to return the product(s). It won't happen...
1,Bad even for a cheap omelette pan,"I bought the omelette pan knowing was a cheap one, even considering that, this pan is not worth to buy. Cheap manufacturing (almost falls apart during first use), bad materials (sharp thin metal), I use with medium low heat and the plastic pieces start to melt. The lid handle is a poorly designed. I recommend not to buy this product."
1,"Poor quality, poor performance.","I ordered this to replace an aging omelet pan. The non-stick doesn't work very well, a small piece broke off after 2 uses and the handle tab on the lid burnt and bubbled up already. I tried to use some cooking oil on the non stick to help stop food from sticking. It didn't work. I returned the pan."
1,1 star is too many,"I have been purchasing things online from Amazon and other retailers for many, many years and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a bad review for a product. Out of all the products I have ever bought, this things is by far the biggest piece of SH** I have ever had the displeasure of owning. I could spend more time and effort bashing it but I will not waste my time. I'm done!"
2,4 eggs,to make omellete requires 4 eggs minimum who eats 4 eggs at once no mention of this in description of product
1,Piece of Junk,"Nordic Ware Divided Skillet/Omelet Pan, CharcoalA veritable piece of junk. When I tried to fold it over right out of the box, the hinges bent and now the edges of the pan do not line up making it useless for omelets.Don't bother!"
1,Poor Quality Omelet maker,"After using this product the very first time to make omelets, I noticed that the omelet sticks at the center. After a few uses the sticking became so bad that I eventually decided to throw this product away. It was a waste of money."
2,Disappointed in Pan,I was disappointed with this purchase. It wasn't the quality of the pan. It was the actual cooking of the omelets. The inside of the omelet stayed runny after it was taken up. I tried leaving the egg mixture in there longer before adding the filling but it didn't help much because the outside cooked too long. I went back to my regular skillet after several attempts. Now it's another thing to store under the cabinets that I don't use.
3,Divided Skillet Omelet Pan & Poacher,Great as an egg poacher. When making an omelet it tends to burn because the the metal on the outside is too thin. Black color scratches off easily.
5,Omlet Pan Great and usful Product,Purchased this Omlet pan after looking thur many web sites. This one was the best for the price.
1,Danger! Do not buy this product.,"Don't buy this product if you want to cook an omelet. The metal is thin and will burn the center of your omelet and when folding the divider and turning your omelet, it spills out over your stove. Major mistake spending money on this piece of junk."
4,"It's an Omelet Pan, it's an Egg poacher",Does exactly what it was designed to do. Not my first omelet pan-a replacement for the original one that wore out after a mere 20 years. The fact that it had the egg poacher insert was the best bonus possible.
2,Nordic Ware OmeletPan/Poacher,"Gave this as a gift, so not sure of its usability. However, when I received the product, it did appear to be awfully light weight. Unsure if it would withstand continued or daily use. I was concerned if it would warp with a lot of use. I have not heard from the receipient of the pan, so hoping it has withstood with use."
4,Happy Camper,Such an easy and successful way to shop. Product was just what I wanted and I didn't even have to go out in the flaming Arizona summer to get it.
2,Buy Something Else!,This pan is cheaply made and everything sticks. I went to QVC and bought a great omelet pan item #K6518 and what a difference! It's not a divided pan but makes great eggs!
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!,"This is the worst piece of junk I've ever purchased. It's made from a cheap grade of aluminum and is definitely NOT non-stick. The handle constantly works loose. Tiny pieces of the ""non-stick"" finish chip off each time I use it (and no, I'm not using metal utinsels and no I'm not scrubbing it with steel wool). I'm really surprised that Nordic Ware would sell such a worthless piece of trash. Do yourself a favor: buy something else."
4,Makes a nice omelet!,"I think this is a pretty good omelet pan overall. It's easy to use and flip one side onto the other. It takes a little time to get used to what temperature works best for cooking the egg so that it's not runny but after a few tries it gets easier, still tricky at times. The omelets usually turn out very good and haven't had any problems sticking in the pan. I always add a spray of Pam to it first anyway. I like the egg poaching insert too but have yet to give it a try."
5,Best omelet pan around!,Outstanding omelete pan. Excellent coating prevents sticking; it is easy to 'flip' the top onto the omelet. Enjoyable pan to use.
2,A Little Disappointed,"I was hesitant to buy this pan after reading the reviews, but honestly there are not a lot of options out there for this type of pan, so it was the lesser of all evils! I bought it to replace a very old Mirro pan that had passed down to me by my mother, but now the teflon is peeling off. I am no novice, but this pan was a huge disappointment. The pan heats unevenly, and it sticks no matter how much you coat it with oil or butter. I have always cooked my omelets on very low heat, and even doing that it appears that the nonstick coating is bubbling. I am going to contact Mirro to see if I can find a replacement for the one I have. I like the hinged pan because I can sautee my vegetables in one side and then when the other side with eggs starts to set, I transfer the vegetables to that side, pour in the rest of the egg, and when that sets I close the pan and have a fantastic omelet. Looks like I am back to folding my own!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"The nonstick surface inside this pan started flaking off after a couple of uses. It also burns the eggs. Maybe it's as WhiteElephant said, you can't use it with a glass cooktop. I'm now shopping for a new omelet pan, as this one was a total waste of money."
1,There is a better way to win big,I have hundreds of hours playing video poker and you need to play my way to win. I push harder on the double up and that is key to my success. Nine times out ten I walk away with several hundred. His way is too tame and does not facter in the strategy of law of averages and the flow of each machine as you play it. Knowing when to stop and when to double up several times during the course of a session.
4,Steel Goalie Net,Received the Goalie Net in record time!1 day after email stated that it was shipped.My son loves it and it is very durable.The only issue I had was putting it together.I was warned it would be difficult and it was.My husband and I both were frustrated and one of thebolts was stripped.At this point I can't send it back and I'll have to fix it somehow.
4,Great product at a great price,These pans are the perfect size to make my jumbo blueberry muffins. I love the size because they easily nest and don't take up much space in the cabinet. They clean up easily and bake evenly.
2,The New Family Cookbook,Yes I'm not crazy about this book. Don't see anything that's appealing to my taste. Others may see it differently.
1,"Wrong title, correctly FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT DIABETES!","Recipes in this book ""for people with diabetes"" using many times lots of sugar. Sugar is a taboo for people with diabetes, especially in the quantities recommended in this book.This book could be called a SURE KILLER FOR POEPLE WITH DIABETES. The title stated also AMERICAN DIABEATES ASSOCIATION. Is the AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION trying to get the people with diabetes real sick as a business for the doctors or perhaps the undertakers?"
2,don't fit wide calves,"these are cute, inexpensive, and seem very comfy. unfortunately, they don't fit my wider calves. I will have them stretched, if possible, at a shoe repair place, or possibly add stretch inserts if not too much more money. I wish shoe makers would change sizing of the whole shoe, not just the sole, when making 11's and 12's."
5,Doyenne Pull on boot by Clarks,"These boots are very stylish, they feel great and are true to size.If you are looking for something other than the same old mass produced boots, these fit the bill.Happy Shopping!"
1,The book that has not been delevered,I ordered this book last year. You are still promising delivery on December 3rd 2000. This appears to be the only way I can get to you. Where is the book?
3,Love just one song...,"My daughter's preschool teacher used a song from this album in class at Christmas-time, and I just has to have it. It is the cutest little song about a child who has been naughty, but promises to do better, so she's on the watch for Santa. The kids learned actions to it, and it became a holiday staple. Unfortunately, I don't even like to listen to the rest of the album. Some tracks ae even annoying. Wish I could have just bought the single, but I would still get it again just for the one song. I just need to put it on an MP3 so I don't have to endure the rest of the album."
4,Stiffler's mom?,"All I could think of the first time I heard this song was Fish and Stiffler's mom from American Pie! I couldn't believe my ears! Just the same, I got a good laugh and this tune is definitely catchy. It sure grabbed me!"
3,The song sucks,"I hate this song with a rabid vengance! But I gave this 3 stars for one reason. I'm a pervert, so I LOVE the video for this song. So just download the video, and ignore this crappy song."
1,Love the Video&Concept but wack Song,every year you get a Corperate Band that has one of these Novelty Songs that envokes Fantasys from your youth&it's catchy for a good minute.usually as is the case with this Song the Video overtakes the song&adds a whole lot more life to it overall.this Video is cool but I keep the Song mainly on mute.
1,why is it on mix stations,i think i kno why it is horrible. It is stupid this song. It is not even hip hop once a hip hop head liked it and he stunk it was 2pac haha jk.
1,Precious but a problem,"This webkinz is so cute,but the code received with the dog would not let us register, it kept saying code was invalid. I bought the dog new so the code should have been good I have emailed everyone I could think of so we really just have a little stuffed animal. My granddaughter was disappointed because she already has 2 others and knows how much fun they can be."
5,Webkinz - Lil Kinz,"I was a little reluctant to order this item because it was a ""Lil Kinz"" instead of a regular ""Webkinz"", but it had the internet capability and my son really wanted a webkinz, so I ordered it. Fortunately, it is exactly the same as a regular webkinz, only a little smaller in size, which I think is better. We are very pleased with the toy, my 7 yr. old son loves it, however, I thought it was way over priced, and it was one of the cheapest webkinz listed on Amazon. If you can find webkinz in your local store, you can buy them for half the price paid here, but the catch is, ""if you can find them"". I'm glad we were able to get this one, however, I will wait for my local store to restock before I pay this high price on Amazon again."
5,Lil Kinz Chihuahua,"I love this toy! It was the first webkinz I ever got, I named it Sammy and registered it on the website. The websites really great and there are lots of things to do and now I have over 50 webkinz and I love them all! I highly Recommend this toy."
5,daughter loves it,"This was my daughters first webkin. 3 years later and shes still in great shape, even after 3 washes!"
5,"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!",What a WONDERFUL book! I have been fortunate to have heard Dr. Gayle Davis speek a number of times and reading this book brought back ALL the great ideas that she shared through the talks. After reading the book from cover to cover I now use it as a daily thought book -- I jsut open it up to whatever page it happens to open to and think about what is on those pages. It is a GREAT way to start the day off on a positive track! This book is a MUST READ for everyone in all professions and ages... Thanks Dr. Davis for sharing your wisdom through the written word!
5,Highly motivational and easy to apply,"Dr. Davis provides a self improvement guide that ""normal"" people can actually use to experience immediate results. An extrememly friendly read that is full of artistic visualization which applies to us all and helps us to clearly understand why we are who we are. I have read many self improvement and ""how to"" type books. High Performance Thinking is by far the very best. Read it for both your professional and personal life. I read the entire book in one setting (a first in my 47 years on this Earth)."
1,Cheesy Fiction Based Upon Unbiblical Theology,"For many years, the pop-eschatology fad within evangelical culture was defined by Hal Lindsay's newspaper eisogesis ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" and the 1970's melodramatic ""Thief in the Night"" film saga. Then came this book---1995's ""Left Behind."" Sixteen books of declining quality, three low-budget movies (and one reboot starring has-been actor/Scientologist Nicolas Cage), two video games, and a radio show later, Left Behind has it's own following within Christian circles. It's inspired myriad imitators, but in the end, there can be only one.Unfortunately, the framework the series is built around, Dispensational Premillennialism, is an unbiblical interpretation of God's Word. It is truly ""theological fiction."" Lack of exegesis aside, it's just bad writing. Stock characters with goofy names, cheesy plotlines, stereotypical villans...Save your money and leave it behind."
5,The best of Italian rap-dance,"Sinceramente no encuentro este CD en mi ciudad... Sin embargo conozco el tema MA QUALE IDEA desde el a√±o 1981. No me canso de escucharlo me parece de una coordinacion y combinacion de sonidos brillante. Solo me gustaria y aprovecho la oportunidad para saludar a Pino, y para que alguien me envie la letra del tema. Gracias"
1,Speed and NO tempture,Junk Does not fit unit's they say it fit's. Does NOT have temp. Will not buy here again problems with return. Can not rate a 0
1,Not very happy,"The item was fine but I recieved 2 of them (in seperate boxes) the same day.I was at work and ordered 1 sensor, the next day at work I got an e-mail saying my order did not go through, so I ordered it again and then somehow miraculously the first order went through also. I was not contacted through e-mail saying the first order went through like I did when it didn't go through, anyway I ended up with 2 sensors and I only needed one, so I had to pay to have it shipped to me and to ship it back. Needless to say I am not very happy, you can tell me when an order doesn't go through but you do not have the curtesy to tell me when it all of a sudden does go through."
2,Not the best option,"I bought this speakers a few days before. The sound quality isn't to good; you can hear the ""noise sound"" when the volume is louder than about 50%. You should think twice before buy this."
5,"A dark, unfolding story of the atrocities of World War II","Heretofore the author of short stories, George Thomas Clark's 637-page biographical novel Hitler Here documents his ability to carry an extended and complex plot focused upon Adolf Hilter, his friends and his subordinates. Expertly researched, the fictionalized treatment allows the author to peer into and reflect Hitler's mind, and talk directly to historical figures such as Eva Braun, Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, and more. In fact, the novel's style is not that of a traditional unbroken narrative, but rather a lengthy, hodgepodge collection of first-person reports and views from a wide variety of figures - each excerpt is rarely more than a page in length, and together they piece together a dark, unfolding story of the atrocities of World War II. A compelling tale, all the more horrific for its grounding in truth."
4,Bold and Insightful,"This is a fine & unusual read where the author has been bold and brave in attempting to get inside the minds of real people by writing in the 1st person. The book follows the life of Hitler from his own self-discovery, rise to power; preparations for war & of course the war itself. All the main players are portrayed in the book including Hitler, Himmler, Bormann, Goebbels, Goering, Rommel, Guderian, Mussolini, Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt. The author also portrays the common fighting soldier & more intimate moments with the likes of Eva Braun. Trying to rationalize the above big names' actions & dare to attempt to recreate their thoughts must have been difficult, but author has drawn on many references, memoirs & historical fact. Bringing these real characters back to life may draw some criticism in some circles, but the end result makes for compelling reading & interesting & insightful portrayals. Recommended reading for anyone with an interest in history."
5,Downtick,"I HAVE NEVER READ A THRILLER QUITE AS GOOD AS THIS ONE. IT KEPT MY ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. NEVER A DULL PAGE. SEEMS REGAN DID QUITE A BIT OF STUDYING ON THIS ONE, IT CAME THROUGH IN HIS BOOK.HE REALLY KNEW HIS STUFF. CAN'T WAIT TO READ IN THE RED. HOPE IT'S AS GOOD."
4,"frank tovey of fad gadget, never found his audience","Tovey was a one man band as fad gadget making quirky electronic music in the early 80s, occasionally making it onto MTV. In the late 80s/90s he made traditional music, real traditional. Like with aboriginal and country/acoustic instruments. The songs on here are excellent, with sharp songwriting. His writing got better after his earlier work. I heard this as a college DJ when it came out. He died about 2-3 years ago, remembered for electronica contributions more than this, a better period of work."
4,JUMP SHIP-GREAT BOOK,I think that this book is great for all ages. My fifth grade class read this book together and it inspired many conversations. This book was a fun and interesting way to learn about what was happening during the revolution. This is just one of the books in this trilogy. The detail in this book was amazing! I found this book a great pleasure and I don't think any minute reading this was a waste of time!
3,"My words, my opinion","Jump Ship to Freedom by James and Christopher Collier. It is about a 14 year old boy named Daniel Arabus. He is an African American slave from Connecticut that has just found out that he and his mother are being sold to the West Indies by Captain Ivers their owner. he is a really grumpy and bad man. Daniel finds out that he has some soldier's notes that can free him and his mother from SLAVERY for forever. Along the way, he travels with a Quaker. And he Really needs a doctor. He stops at a tavern (when he escapes) when he sees that Captain Ivers is looking for him. Will he ever find FREEDOM??????????"
1,Boring,"Jump Ship to Freedom was awful! It lacked realism, drifted along through the plot very sloowwwllyyy, and left me bored and disinterested. I literally had to force myself through the ending (required to finish for a class). If you are an avid reader of historical fiction there is MUCH better out there."
1,Jump Ship to Freedom!,"I thought that the book was dry, boreing, and had too much detail to it. It had a lot of un needed dilog to. I would rate this book at best a 2 out of 10. Not a great book to read!"
4,GREAT EYEWITNESS GUIDES,"I have used these guides for my travels in Ireland, London, Scotland, Rome, Florence, Venice, Switzerland, Germany and Amsterdam. These have to be some of the best guides ever.One thing that I would like to see in these guides are the locations of hotels that are near train stations. Most budget travelers use the trains and need a hotel near stations.I have plans to use this on my trip next year.John Shearn"
5,Great Guide,I have traveled to Spain twice with this guide. It is concise and well organized to let you easily find what you need to know. It is compact enough to carry with you. I carried mine in a cross body bag. I would highly recommend!
3,Helpful and interesting,"This book helped me to determine a few of the locations I would end up going to on my trip to Spain, and in retrospect the book did not let me down. It's easy to navigate through and includes lots of maps and bright pictures."
3,Picture this,I enjoyed perusing this book before my trip. It gave a snapshot of the area and is packed with gorgeous pictures and diagrams. It's a little light on history or detail.I used Rick Steves' book also for more in-depth knowledge of an area.
5,Spain. Eyewitness Travel.,"Great book, lots of information of where to go, things to do andbeautiful pictures"
2,Pretty but useless,"This book is full of pretty pictures but is quite useless as a guide for independent travelers. It doesn't have any information on how to get from one place to another, the hours of operations of museums/buses/trains, or any price ranges. The maps are detailed in 2 block radius, but it's impossible to understand how to link the mini-maps to get a comprehensive picture."
2,Check Your Digital Audio Input!,"I received my SC-HT425d for christmas, and have only been able to use it once. The optical digital audio input on the receiver (from the DVD player) malfunctioned. I dropped off my receiver at an authorized Panasonic repair center on January 12. They still have it. It turns out that the part that needs to be replaced is not available until MAY! In fact, the Panasonic rep told the repair technician that not many people use the digital audio connection, and there may be MANY defective units out there.There is a fibre-optic connector cable included in the box, try it out and see if your product is defective!"
1,Description Says 5 Disc Changer - - FALSE,If you go to panasonic's website and put in the model number you'll see that this is NOT a 5 disc changer. It's a decoder/dvd player. Panasonic even lists the items which are incorporated and there is no mention that the progressive scan dvd player is a 5 changer. There are only two models with a 5 disc changer listed on panasonic's site and this isn't one of em. Read and Research people!
1,Too broken for me to see it,"It arrived in more pieces than I could count, thanks to no packing around the manufacturer's box. What a shame."
5,awsome,this is the best toy i ever purchased for my 5 year old he has hours of fun with it everyone with a young child should purchase one
4,AT&T Nation 450 Rollover Minutes,A good deal for me. I roll minutes over every month and this offer is working well for me. There r little add ons that work for some people as well. Enjoy..
3,"Good adventure, Questionable zoology","Messner's book is really two books: one, a well-written adventure story; the other, a confusing attempt to show the yeti is a large and very strange type of brown bear. Whatever one thinks of the yeti, the bear hypothesis seems a poor fit. Messner describes yetis routinely walking and even running on two feet and includes photographs of an ordinary-looking brown bear he claims is the mysterious bipedal chemo, or yeti. Messner knows the land and its people well, but seems not to have done much research on bears. This is a worthwhile addition to the literature on this subject, but Messner has not found the definitive solution to the yeti mystery."
2,Disappointed,"It's worth picking up in a library, but I was disappointed after paying the hardcover price following a favorable review in Outside magazine. It's really two books in one, as another reviewer said - a book about the author's search for the Yeti of myth, and a few chapters about an obscure kind of bear. Apparently the author thinks that the Yeti stories are basically Tibetan legens about the bear; that's a great theory, but I'm not sure it's worthy of the sensationalistic title/cover that this book has."
4,Excellent Adventure Travel Book,"As the title of the review states, this is an excellent adventure travel book. Messner goes further than many of the armchair anthropologists by slugging through the Himalayas in an attempt to confirm his hypothesis. While I found the lack of true ""scientific data"" (before drawing a conclusion) a little disturbing, that does not detract from this well thought out, and contrary to other reviews, well written book. It is worth noting that the idea that the large footprints discovered were the result of a bear ""consistently"" stepping in the print made by its front paws is laughable, but that was my only major gripe. It starts off like a high speed adventure thriller and then slows to a reasonable pace as it presents the facts (as Messner knows them). It is a very fast read, so I would suggest the library or the ""lowest price"" option if one is considering buying the book. All the same, a SOLID four stars and a recommendation for this book."
1,NOT 17 FEET long like it is stated,"I bought this because it seem like a good value because it was 17 feet. However, when I got it, I was surprised at how short it was. I looked at the back of the package and it also stated it was 17 feet. It is more like only 8-9 feet.I really don't get it though since the package stated it was 17 feet and it looked unopened...."
2,"OK, but very thin and lacking much insight","I found some of her insights interesting, and a few caused me to chuckle. But this book really serves to reinforce French stereotypes, so it's not very illuminating. The writing isn't great, and in some places, it's just plain sloppy.I'd recommend ""Almost French"" by Sarah Turnbull over this book. It's more thoughtful, better written and more insightful. Her husband does not come off well in the book, as other reviewers have noted. Not recommended."
2,Amusing But Not Deep,This book is not bad for light reading. The anecdotes are quite amusing but the author doesn't really provide deeper insights into French culture. Some of the author's interpretations of French behaviour are too simplistic - nothing you've never heard before. A better buy would be Polly Plat's French or Foe. It also appears that this book was written in haste - the jokes in dialogue format at the end of each chapter do not seem well integrated with the book. It seems like they were placed there because the author did not put in much thought as to how to insert them well into the chapters.
4,A well done job,"Harriet Welty Rochefort has done an excellent job in conveying the feelings of what it really is to be an American living in a foreign world, this world happens to be Paris and other points in France. One must take into consideration that she is married to a Frenchman so she isn't exaclty a stranger in a small world. This book was an excellent travel companion for my first trip to France and was thoroughly enjoyable. She describes everything from what goes into making a ""french lunch,"" no sandwhiches please, to the ins and outs of not getting ripped out at the local Boulangerie. I await more of Harriet's writing...."
1,Wanted to Like It,"I love francophile literature written by anglophones. It often makes me chuckle and shake my head in agreement. I wanted to like this book but the writing is incredibly weak. She manages to backtrack and repeat herself, rewording the same sentiment, yet saying nothing at all insightful or giving any vivid stories to illustrate her point. I would expect this kind of writing from a student in a creative writing class, not in a professionally published book. I much prefer the skillful writings of Peter Mayle and the like."
2,Iowa vs. Paris--who won?,"This book does not contain many new insights into French culture, which is perplexing since the author has been married to a Frenchman and living in France for 20 years. She often seems to wish that the French weren't so French, despite her protestations to the contrary.This is an amusing and fast read, but I would recommend getting it from the library rather than spending money on it."
1,"Iowa vs. Paris--Iowa wins, except for the schools & the food","While it is an entertaining read, this book does not present many new insights. The author also seems to wish that the French weren't so French, despite her claims to the contrary.In short, I would recommend getting this book from the library, not spending money on it. I agree with other reviewers who have recommended Peter Mayle or Polly Platt instead. I found them to be more sensitive to and appreciative of the peculiarities and idiosyncracies of French culture."
3,A Comparison of Paris versus the American Midwest,"French Toast by Harriet Welty Rochefort is a cute book and the story of her living in France for twenty years as the American wife of a Frenchman. The editing could have been better. Her comments and anecdotes come off as random thoughts made over a long period of time. Without a good reviewer some of the comments contradict - but not often. Her writing is simple and comes from the heart of someone who grew up in America's Midwest. It's an entertaining book with some facts about being an ex-pat American living the life of a working French wife and mother in Paris. Her comparisons, though, are measured between living in Paris and living in Iowa. That's like comparing living on Earth versus living in the Klingon Empire. But, all-in-all the book is entertaining."
2,Whiner,I usually love any book about Paris or the French but I found the author to be quite a whiner. It made me even start to dislike Paris while I was reading the book. I didn't finish the book because it put me in a negative mood and made me question my love for Paris.I would not recommend this book if you love Paris and all things French.
2,pas mal,"This is a very light read. I read this book in two evenings.In terms of explaining the french experience, this book does a goodjob of it. If you are into a travelling adventure, I recommend Peter Mayle instead of this."
1,Avoid this book,"Having recently returned from Paris, I was eager to keep my memories of this magical city fresh. Described by one reviewer as the Peter Mayle of Paris, this book sounded so good I purchased both this and ""French Fried.""Ugh! It's the first time in my life I wanted to throw a book away. She is negative, humorless and a mediocre writer.She apparently moved to France and spends her days wishing the French were more like Iowans. She wallows in her ignorance and is proudly ill-mannered, unschooled and unable to cook. After 20 years in Paris, the best she can do is work her pressure cooker! Avoid this book if you like (or think you might ever like) Paris."
2,awful reading will distress anyone who speaks French,"Why they couldn't find someone who can pronounce French words correctly--even people with American accents don't pronounce Rimbaud as if the first syllable rhymes with Rintintin--to impersonate an author who has lived in France for two decades and taught at some of the best schools there is a mystery to me--the reading is offensive and ruins the experience of the book, which might have been enjoyable."
4,God Bless America,"A friend recommended this book to me, I enjoyed it. It is a very quick read. I have never had a burning desire to go to Paris and after reading this book Paris has been put on my ""don't go there"" list. Assuming her portral is accurate I fear I would quickly be labeled an ugly American were I to visit the City of Lights."
1,narrow-minded,"This is one of the most inaccurate and unenlightened ""deciphering the French"" books around. (Along with her second book - ""French Fried"") It is sad how someone who has lived in Paris for 30 years and even has a French husband has so little (if any) insight to who the French are and the differences and similarities between the French and Americans. It is a book which only continues the typical closed-minded people have."
2,Save your money,"This book does not contain many new insights into French culture, which is perplexing since the author has been married to a Frenchman and living in France for 20 years. She often seems to wish that the French weren't so French, despite her protestations to the contrary.This is an amusing and fast read, but I would recommend getting it from the library rather than spending money on it."
2,Pretty but Unacceptably Flawed,"I bought this book because it is beautiful and it looked like fun brain exercise. But much to my disappointment I found too many mistakes in the answers. A good example is the very pretty Pick Up Sticks. The answer in the back is most definitely wrong! I find this type of error in this type of book to be unacceptable, and think it could be very frustrating and discouraging to a person that might not be able to tell whether or not their answer was indeed correct and the book was wrong. I returned my copy to the book store."
2,Annoying...,"There are many great riddles, but way too often are the questions, answers and short tutorials incomplete, misleading or plain wrong. Unbelievable that he can't even correctly define what a complete graph is. He says you have a complete graph if every two nodes can be connected by two disjunct paths. What a [junk]. His intentions might be good, but he's way too careless. I tried to read some puzzles several times, but about one third of the time it's just annoying and frustrating. Note that I'm not frustrated because I can't solve the problems. I can, that's the sad part. It's him, making mistakes."
4,awsome book,This is one of the best puzzle books EVER!They are challenging but not to hard. The only problem is 5 days after i got it the binding broke in 4 spots. Still very satisfied
3,Could have been so much better,"Although the satanist in the video clearly says that he is not a wiccan/witch, just the presence of a satanist in the video gives the impression that witchcraft involves devils and/or demons (it does not). Excluding the satanist part, the video was just O.K. It didn't really give much useful information and anyone looking to buy this video to learn about modern witchcraft or wicca, in my opinion, will be disappointed."
1,are you really stupid enough to fall for this...,WHAT IS THIS!!! A STRATEGY GUIDE FOR A RACING GAME!!!! WHAT IDIOT WOULD MAKE THAT!?
2,Poison,"Zaiko Langa Langa have done the CD ""Poison"" with extra zeal. What is amazing is how they still sound very Zaiko of the 70s and 80s l have lived to love. Proverbs 22:1 takes you to the dance floor with impulse. Liloba number is the upbeat which leaves you wanting to listen to the Old ""Dede"". I recomend you buy both CD and the video. The dance is wonderful. Long Live Zaiko Langa Langa."
4,Good product,"The shoe fits pretty well and for the heel is very comfortable. The only problem I had with the shoe is that the straps that go around your heal were exceptionally long! I took them to a nearby cobbler shop, and good thing otherwise they would've slipped off my feet."
1,Only a book to promote Robbi's organization,"All this book talked about was JWI and how they did things, this book was made to promote JWI, not to help brides plan their weddings!!!! Every other sentence was about JWI!! There is a huge bias in the writing of this book"
3,1 of 4 disks doesn't play,"My family enjoyed 3 of the 4 movies in this packet & thought the transfers were of adequate quality, but ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" had repeated episodes of the image & sound getting stuck, to the point that we gave up on it. As it turned out, that was the least favorite one, so if it had to happen, I'm glad it was that one. I haven't contacted the seller for a replacement - it was a 'downer' movie anyway, so I don't care that much, and to the extent I'd choose to watch that particular film noir title again, I'd choose a different version."
5,A Great Purchase,"I bought this collection using a gift card given to me December 24th. I won't go into a lot of detail because if you are a Bogart fan you already know about his talent. I will say out of the many copies I have the TCM reproduction series is one of the best copies I have seen. The picture and sound is fantatic in each of the movies. Many of these old classics can be bought in the .99 bin, however most of those reproductions were from well used film reels and not good at all. TCM has done a great job with these copies and worth it if you are looking to see silver screen legends. The only complaint I could say is that all four movies cames stacked on a single spindel in the box. But the fact each movie has their own disc I was happy sine multiple movie disc in my option never works well. This is great buy for your classic video collection."
2,Cleaned up story,"The James Cain novel was a gritty tale about a drifter who lands a job at a greasy spoon run by a Greek with a slatternly wife. The love or lust affair between the drifter and the wife is animalistic and turns to murder.This movie would have none of that. The Greek becomes a man named Smith, and the whory wife becomes Lana Turner with perfect blond hair, perfect makeup, very nice clothes. Ms. Turner supposedly said once that she would rather lose a valuable earring than be without her makeup in public. That fits. In 1946 Hollywood just couldn't present a female star looking other that glamorous. As an aside, I will admit that Ms. Turner looked fine.The greasy spoon diner becomes a rather fashionable looking restaurant. And the producer even felt the need to provide a lame explanation of how the title somehow fit with the story."
2,Just a little...Overrated,"I bought this movie with the expectations of seeing a really good, intense movie, since the story was adapted form a James Cain novel, has great reviews, and a good cast. Instead, I saw a movie with a jumpy script that was dissatisfying. The basic plot is good, but has so many little twists that it is rather unbelievable and fake. Lana was good as the beautiful girl, and James Garfield was O.K. as a drifter that chases after women. The lawyers were excellent. I give the actor a 4 but the 2 is for the story dynamics."
2,"Bad casting, bad sets, bad costumes","So disappointing. Hardly a dark/noir film, in my opinion. Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery. And there's no sex, except brief kissing which Lana always cuts short! I'm a James M Cain fan, and this doesn't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel. Everyone's too decent. Cora (Lana) doesn't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body, and she's always costumed like a perfect fashion model, fingernail polish and all. Frank (Garfield)is never lustful, never mean, never desperate. Always polite and decent. Not a gas station (except for one pump that looks planted) not a single oil can or wrench. Not a greasy spoon or diner, Twin Oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or B&B, fit for Donna Reed & family. The 80's Nicholson/Mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark. Much more faithful to Cain."
3,"5 Stars for the Films, 3 for the Packaging","I bought this set because I LOVE the films in it - and it was very inexpensive. I bought it despite the fact that these were on double-sided discs - which never last as long and tend to have a lot of problems with skipping and locking up.While the films themselves were great (I prefer them on full screen), the packaging was not. The first disc is in a hard plastic sleeve that slams against the second disc, which is attached to the back of the plastic jacket. The second disc had scratches on it when it arrived NEW. I had to clean it twice before it would play without skipping. This would not be an issue if they did not used double-sided discs. I won't buy any more of these sets because of that. They are priced great, but I'd rather get collections that don't get scratched right out of the factory."
1,TCM Greatest Classic Films,"DVD are set to wrong region code I can not watch them. No instructions to change regions. These films are great and I was really ready to watch them, but was let down."
5,love old murder mysteries,"awesome collection,a must have for every old movied lover four movies matched up with each other perfectly. another must have"
2,Yawn...,Sure Lana Turner looks great in this film but truly that's about all it has going for it. The plot was so thin and predictable I started fidgeting in my chair 10 minutes into it. First of all Mr. Smith all but allowed this affair to happen and in some scenes seems to encourage them. Then the constant attempts at murder bordered on comedy. I have a feeling that the book is better than this production but then if viewers from the 40's just wanted to drool after Ms. Turner then I can see why this was such a big hit.
2,TCM should know better!!,"I can't believe, of all studios, that TCM would release these collections on two-sided disks. This one, in particularly, features four of the greatest suspense films ever made - two featuring the best of the best, BOGART! - but TCM really botched it by releasing all of their collections on easily-scratched two-sided disks.Anyone who buys these collections deserves what they get, you're much better off buying each film separately, even paying more. SHAME ON YOU, Turner Classic Movies, for taking the cheap way out and producing an inferior product when you claim to be all about the love and preservation of classic film!! Guess it's just the customers you don't care about?!"
3,good oldies,Excellent product when Hollywood knew how to make good movies ! These Bogart/Garfield flicks are the gold standard which unfortunately are not likely to come again ?
3,The Acting Is Fine But You Must Overlook Awful Storyline,"Anyone ever heard of a background check?Drifter shows up looking for work. Gets hired on the spot, no references, no background check. Husband lets the young man, who could be a criminal, for all you know, spend time alone with his drop-dead-gorgeous leggy blonde wife, immediately. Encourages them to dance together shortly after meeting. Go down to the beach and swim together alone at night (again, not long after they meet, and before he even knows the guy). He's young, decent looking, and he gets to work and sleep in the same place near his wife. He's single and doesn't get to spend time with any other women.Hmmm... you wonder what could possibly go wrong...Pretty ridiculous, isn't it? But that's the start of this socalled film noire. What's the French for film ridiculous?In any case, if you can hold your nose, and overlook the setup, you will enjoy fine performances all round by a solid cast of characters."
2,Definitely original,"Pilot Airie is losing his mind. The book explores the concept of raveling as opposed to unraveling. As Pilot struggles to understand what happened to his younger sister, Fiona, 20 years ago, who mysteriously disappeared at a family party, he slowly begins to see his family in a more real light. His brother Peter, a brilliant surgeon, gets involved with Pilot's therapist, Katherine DeQuincey-Joy. Is he getting involved with her to find out exactly what Pilot is telling her or are his motives more pure? This book is told from the point of view of Pilot, but we are also privy to the thoughts of others thru Pilot's mind. This is the part that was surreal for me. I didn't care about these characters at all, especially Pilot. The plot moved along slowly and seemed to take its time getting to the point, when we do finally arrive at the end, it is a letdown. Wait for the paperback, if you must read this!"
2,GET MR SMITH A THESAURUS,"I first read about this book in the Denver Post where it received a favorable review. After I was finished, though, I was disappointed that I spent my time on this novel. The fact that the therapist was sharing private conversations from her sessions with Pilot indicated a lapse in the author's judgment. Very unbelieveable. And though I found the overall plot and ending to be creative and suspenseful, I was disappointed that the author found the need to use the F-word over and over and over in mulitple situations and conversations. Surely the mind that came up with this intriguing storyline (minus the therapist debacle) can come up with a better word. It added nothing to the book, but demeaned Mr. Smith's character."
2,Raveling,"As a writer, I found many flaws in this book. The writer uses a poor simile on page 1 (blue-purple vein and trickling wine) and then uses it several times in the novel. When the mother is introduced we get the same description-the cancer and the vein. He gives characters odd behaviors (such as Kathrine always chewing the scabs on her fingers and knuckles--why does she have them?) but never explains why the characters do these things. He uses a cheap tactic to get around the limitations of first person POV and thinks the reader won't mind, and won't find it annoying and confusing. The plot is very compelling (like watching a train wreck) but that is the only good thing about the book. There are a few moments in the book that are well written, and show great talent, but the entire book reads like a promising first draft, and not a polished novel."
5,Twist and Twist Again,"Don't assume for a moment that you know where this story is headed. As soon as you are convinced of one 'truth', you will be cleverly turned around and upside down to face another 'truth'. Incredibly entertaining!!"
1,Horribly unreadable...,"The jumbled plot(what little there is) is very slow to get off the ground and seems artificially forced. The characters are implausible and uninteresting. You may relate to this book if you have A.D.D. or other mental problems (protagonist= nut job) because the writing style is also dreadful. Don't waste your time, there are many better written books. Time is too short to waste."
3,A classic example of an unreliable narrator,"Oops! I hope I didn't spill the beans... What drew me to this book was its amazing cover. Not that you should judge books by thier covers, but in this case the contents match the cover rather closely: a mystery involving spooky woods, sibling rivalry, and a child's dissapearance. There are no chapter breaks, only ""episodes of consciousness,"" in which the narrator slips into omniscence. It's a good first novel, except for some inconsistencies in the voice and point of view, which are necessitated by the ""surprise"" ending."
2,Different from most,"I did not care for this album, nor anything else by I Start Counting.Were they trying to sound like Depeche Mode?I would not recommend this album, unless you mind a homemade feel IMO.A few songs are good, and do not get me wrong, this artist might be different from most. It may be an acquired listening experience.Most people probably have not heard of this artist. Again, buyer beware."
1,It's fine for the price,I found this item to be equal to the Conair curling iron you can buy in a drug store for less money.
5,suzyq,"I was so glad to find a Ceramic curling iron in 1/2"" since they are hard to find. This is a great product that I would buy again. If you have short hair as I do it does a wonderful job. And because it is ceramic it does add shine to your hair."
5,Great iron,I am a professional hairstylist and love this iron. It smooths the hair and helps give a fuller style for all hair legnths. Great for making that lift at the crown. Good for hair you want to make straighter without making it flat to your head. Also its much healthier for your hair than a flat iron. I reccommend it to all my clients.
3,thermal fuse bad,"The wife used it for about two months, when it stopped working. The light would turn on but no heat. So, I took it apart for evaluation of the circuit (I'm that kind of guy)and found the thermal fuse was bad. I found a replacement by a better manufacturer and soldered it in. Works fine now...hopefully longer than two months. Most people would by a new one, so I would rate the reliability of this product less than desirable."
1,Sad disappointment concerning Gold and Hot Curling Iron,"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. ONE OF THE WORST IRONS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, AND WAS A HAIRDRESSER FOR YEARS."
1,only lasted 20-30 minutes,I just purchased this iron. The one I got only lasted 20-30 minutes and then it stop working. It will not heat up. I contacted Amazon and they are sending out a new one. I will change my rating if the new one works well. We will see! I hope it works! I am a little disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"Really disappointed in this product. I have been a Gold N Hot user for many years--love their products so I was looking forward to receiving this curling iron. I was looking for a good curling iron that offers some protection from the harsh heat of a regular curling iron. What I got was an iron that Does Not Curl! The temp settings allow you to go up to 400+ but no matter what the temp, this iron does not curl my hair. Granted, my hair is thick but unlike the other Gold N Hot curling irons, it barely makes a dent. Guess I'll continue to use my old standby Hot N Gold irons. My advice--Don't buy unless you have very thin hair."
1,poor quality,The paper stock used for this poster is quite flimsy. The resolution of the image is poor.
2,Pretty Cheap,"Although this item serves a purpose as a wall mount, it is basically worthless if the speaker that you are using weighs more than 2 or 3 pounds. Beyond that, and the mounts bend and become useless. I can probably use these for a different purpose as I have several other projects where they might work, but I would suggest that you pick another type of wall mount for speakers."
1,Waste of time and money,"These speaker mounts won't hold the 10 lbs. listed in the description, they bend.Probably fine for cubes, but don't expect them to hold anything larger."
3,No baroque dance in this one!,"Music: PerfectSinging: PerfectCostumes and Scenery: Not badTechnical quality: PerfectDance: Very modern ballet, which is a great disappointmentThese vignettes are not plot oriented. Usually the love conflict is happily resolved in the first third of each vignette, clearing the way for the real purpose of these pieces, which is a very long instrumental-and-dance extravaganza. I don't know if the original dance notation has survived. But surely, if this production has such authentic baroque music it really should have baroque dance, instead of a leaps-and-lifts choreography that does not even remotely resemble it."
1,WITH PROFOUND APOLOGIES TO JEAN-PHILIPPE?,"Forget that attractive, dignified cover art: this is modern Euro-trash, start to finish. Any Rameau fan who values the unique blend of grandeur and sprightly good humor that permeates so much of the French master's music will find this production patently offensive. Christie and his troops mistakenly equate vulgar buffoonery and the most absurd posturing with good humor and high spirits. That a conductor of Christie's stature endorses and participates in such revolting nonsense is (for me) a real eye-opener. Who woulda thought. Give it a wide berth--IF you love Rameau."
5,Now this is more like it!,"This is far and away the best Rameau DVD out there. Though the production is modern, it stays within the Barouqe style and is not a distraction from the music. The tempi are lively and slow arias are touching. The premise of the opera is original by even today's standard and offers the viewer a good idea of what a baroque opera prouction would have looked like in the 1730's while making full use of modern technology. Good extras on the DVD and very exciting music, of course!"
5,Enchanting Intensity !,"The magnificent Les Arts Florissants conducted by William Christie perform this fabulous French Baroque opera with enchanting intensity. As in Rameau's Les Boreades, Paul Agnew is excellent here as well. Danielle de Niese, Patricia Petibon and Nicolas Rivenq are stunning. The marvelous combination of ultra-modern dance and Baroque music doesn't distract from the original premise of the opera, and imbues this gripping drama with vigor and spectacular excitement. As a total artistic experience and grand entertainment, this production is outstanding. Utterly exciting and highly entertaining, this is truly the best Rameau DVD out there !"
5,A great album of American music.,"This album made me proud the Dead were Americans.I hope they play ""Ripple"" at my funeral.This one and ""Workingmans' Dead"" made a great 1-2 combination___ 2 super albums!!!"
5,Anytime Music,"There are only a few CD's that can be played at any time, no matter what the mood. This is one of them. The CD's title says it all, this is truly an American Beauty!!"
5,It's a beauty!!!,Aside from the european tour album or the ideosyncratic terrapin station this is THE essential Grateful Dead classic. As the dead releases are more or less compilations and recompilations this is the one that shares its material with those compilations. Ok want to have a comprehensive collection buy Dicks Picks all 150 cds! (Don't know. Am I exagerating????) But if you only want to fork out for one cd then this is it! Latest edition with even more bangs for your bucks.
4,Good album.,"This album contains some of the Dead's best songs. ""Box of Rain,"" ""Sugar Magnolia,"" ""Candyman,"" and several others are definite classics. However, it has some weaker spots such as ""Operator"" and ""Till the Morning Comes"", that keep me from giving it five stars. And it's still a studio album and like any Dead studio album it lacks some of energy and inspiration of the live show. . . try ""Europe '72"" if you like the music from this period."
4,"Not their best, but Still!...","It has been a long-held contention of mine that the Dead would have been better as an acoustic band (and also if they had kept the lead vocals for Weir), and this album seems to bear that out. Actually, because there are so many slow songs, it's not quite five stars, but if they kept it to ""Friend of the Devil,"" ""Ripple,"" Box of Rain"", ""Truckin,"" and ""Sugar Magnolia,"" it would have been five stars and beyond. As it is, the acoustic ""Friend of the Devil"" has a wonderful bluegrass-sounding intro and ""Ripple"" has a lovely mandolin part (by David Grisman.). It's not as good an album as Workingman's Dead, but it's still one of their best and definitely worth it."
5,American Classic,American Beauty and Workingman's Dead are the Dead's two classic studio albums. If you are going to buy any Dead studio albums - buy these.
3,I still don't get it,"I keep trying to listen to the Dead to figure out what all the buzz is about. I bought this based on other customer reviews claiming it to be their best studio album. Sorry Deadheads, I still don't get it."
3,"Grateful to the Dead, but . . .","The Dead's roots were in jug band and hillbilly music, and this album brings them back home. I'm grateful that the Dead (pun fully intended) introduced so many people to America's musical heritage (myself included, 30 years ago), but this is not a great album, especially when compared to the music that inspired it. They hit some nice woody grooves, and there is a pleasant sense of old friends pickin' and singin' on the back porch. Unfortunately the performances are generally thin and ragged, and, though they clearly are trying, they never find that deep vein of American collective unconscious that some of their contemporaries like Dylan and the Band manage to drill into so effectively. If you like this record, check out the real thing - the Carter Family, the Mississippi Sheiks, Dock Boggs, the Skillet Lickers, Doc Watson and Merle Haggard."
3,Somewhat Vapid,"You know you're in trouble as soon as ""Box of Rain"" kicks in - the song is a thin vapid construction. Much of Side 2 doesn't quite add up to anything either - the songs seem like excuses for the band to play with Crosby-Stills-Nash harmonies (using studio technology and tricks).But, a few tracks excel. ""Sugar Magnolia"", ""Candyman"", and ""Truckin'"", particularly. Much of the rest of the album seems like a calculated bid to marry a bit more muscle in with the musical structure of ""Workingman's Dead""."
4,An arrangement of some of the Dead's best songs.,"There is no doubt that these songs are among the best in American musical history. If you have never heard the Dead before or want to try to get into them, this might be a good place to start.But you can't review Dead albums the way you review other bands. 4 stars, because these are good but not the best performances of these songs.Other bands release their ""material"" in ""albums"". Other bands have their songs all written out. The Dead do not just have ""songs"". They have versions upon versions and arrangments upon arrangements of all their songs...so that their individual songs are more like a framework for the band to build up into a unique artwork at every concert.If you like the tunes on this CD, I recommend you next get the live album ""Reckoning"". [...]. There is a whole universe of excellent music out there, once you get into the Grateful Dead."
5,Simply Put....,"This is my favorite album of all time. I can listen to it no matter my mood, time of day, day of the week, year etc. It sounds just as great today as it did the day it was released. I have owned it in every format: 8 track, cassette, vinyl, CD, and now MP3. And I will buy it again in whatever the next technology may be."
4,Would not be out of place on Alt-Country!,"First, a confession--I never was a Dead fan. That said, this is one fine album made better by DVD-Audio surround sound. The primarily acoustic instruments are well recorded (at the legendary Wally HEider studios in S.F.), and the layered vocal harmonies are gorgeous--a real surprise, given the Dead's lack of a standout lead vocalist.And there's absolutely no fat here--no noodling solos anywhere--indeed many songs don't even _have_ instrumental breaks. The focus here is squarely on songwriting--mostly by the team of Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter, with standout turns by Phil Lesh, Bob Weir and Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan. ""Truckin'"" is the most famous tune of the bunch, but they are all good--and are made that much better by the 5.1 surround sound mix.Buy it--even if you don't have a DVD-Audio player, the DVD will play in dolby digital 5.1 sound on all normal DVD players--and it also sound very fine indeed!"
5,One of two really great Grateful Dead Albums,"...the other album being, of course, ""Workingman's Dead"". Like ""Workingman's Dead"", this album works so well because these loveable long-haired dope-smoking acid-dropping coke-snorting pill-popping heroin-injecting whiskey-swilling hippies decided to supress their shamelessly self-indulgent free-form jam tendencies (see ""Live Dead"") and craft a straightforward, unpretentious, no-nonsense album of mellow acoustic rock. Most impressive are the peace-and-love anthem ""Ripple"", the narcissistic ""Friend of the Devil"" and the breathtaking harmonies that grace ""Brokedown palace"". Of course ""Truckin'"" is the most radio-friendly tune here, but this entire record plays like a greatest hits collection. A must-own."
4,Color Me Surprised,"I never considered myself a fan of The Grateful Dead, but then again I never gave them a fair try. My hesitation was due to the extreme cultishness of their fan base and their standard ""hippy dippy"" poster and album artwork. The reason behind why I first chose to listen to this album is not important. What is important is that I can say I'm glad I downloaded this and gave it a fair shot.I was a little bit surprised after I finished listening. I didn't increase my pot intake, I didn't lose my job or drop out of school, and I am not filling my walls with black light posters of dancing bears and skulls. I do feel changed though. My mind is opened up. Maybe if American Beauty (expanded) didn't ruin my life, other classic cult-rock bands won't either. Then again, American Beauty just might be the gateway album that DARE warned us about as kids."
5,This CD really is a beauty,"I love this CD, it is one of my favorite, easily in the Top 10 of my collection of nearly 500.I think that American Beauty is introspective and relaxing without becoming boring, which is an achievement. To listen to it from beginning to end is like taking a journey and the payoff at the end, ""Truckin'"" is well worth the trip.One song that really stands out for me is ""Attics of My Life"". I remember hearing this one years ago, when it first came out and thought it was interesting then, now that I am older, it means even more. The song is church-like in it's presentation and is the pinnacle of this CD.For anyone wishing to gain an introduction to the Grateful Dead, this CD is a great place to start."
3,It's Not Live!,"O.K.--it's the Grateful Dead, but... you really need to hear live stuff to fully appreciate them. There are several good songs on this album, most notably being Truckin', Friend of the Devil, and Ripple. However, the chemistry that explodes in their live performances isn't blazin'in this album. They sound like they feel constricted by the the studio atmosphere and to be honest, that makes this album kind of boring. With all that said, however, their use of instruments is great. I'd still reccomend getting live stuff first, though."
1,Is it the drugs?,"My goodness, this music is dull.Loyal dead-heads will no doubt attack,but anyone with real taste (and sobriety)has to question the devotion paid to sucha boring, medicore band as this. Plus, it'sderivative too. The Dead is Dead, long livegood music!"
1,It wallows in its own mediocrity,"This is an incredibly mediocre album. It's one-dimensional, Jerry has a weak voice, and it's all together one of the most overrated bands in America. Just because they went more commercial and have more merchandise than any other band, that doesnt make then the best. A true rock 'n' roll fan would recommend ANY album by ""The Band"" as opposed to this... I suggest ""Rock of Ages"" or ""The Best of the Band"""
5,"Unlike my wife's uncle, i will not be grateful when they are dead","For many years i refused to buy Grateful Dead albums because of a gentleman i worked with who insisted anything shorter than 9 minutes wasn't REAL ""Dead music"". As of gotten older and shaken the ghost's of dead past, i've come to open my mind to giving the Dead another go around. Let me say i'm not sorry to have done that ONE bit as this album is a bonafied classic! Great musicianship, fantastic songs and --here's the key--- no crazy 16 minute jams! (i feel the dead fans coming out of the wood-work getting ready to pelt me with rotten veggies)If you are like me and you are unsure whether to make the plunge because of what people have said about the Dead, go forward and do yourself a favor and GRAB this album."
3,Removes stains but not liquid,Works well on set-in stains and is easy to use. The tank takes forever to dry. I didn't use the soap that came with it but it cleaned several areas very nicely. It has decent suction action but doesn't even remove half of the liquid I dispensed to clean the rug. I'm happy with it. Just don't walk on the wet areas.
1,"Awful, awful, awful...","I bought this to use on a couple of cat created nasty spots on area rugs. IT DID NOTHING!!!Though I carefully followed the directions, this machine neither cleaned, extracted, nor did anything the booklet said it would--the spots are just as nasty--the cleaner just added to the horridness by spraying out liquid which was not picked up as promised, and I am SO disappointed.Do not, I repeat, do not buy!!!!!"
1,Sounds like record scratches,"My biggest disappointment is what sounds like record noise: scratches and tics. I can edit these out on the computer, but it is a very time consuming process.I would recommend considering alternative sources for these tunes."
2,Waste of money,"This lock locks up something, I just haven't figured out what to use it for yet! I originally purchased it for a storage unit, but I discovered that did not fit any of the locks on the storage unit, so I it was a waste of money!"
4,great product,"I use this pan often, and I like it a lot.The one thing I don't like is that there's water with rust in it that comes from the edges of the pan after I wash it off.I have to use a special towel when drying it; one that I don't care if it gets stained."
4,Great book with a lot of typos.,"The bible of bizarre. A book so entertaining, that in the mold of Ed Naha's ""Monsters: Scream To Screen"" and ""Science Fictionary"", a film fan can read it cover-to-cover and seldom get bored. And Weldon covers a far wider and wilder range of films than Ed ever did.In fact, the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's a typo every at least few pages; little things, like actors' names. One gets the idea that part of the problem in editing a book like this is finding someone who knows enough about film to find the typos. I could spot them and did, so a minor deduction here.Great book, though. It'll definitely broaden your horizons."
4,flawed but still one of the best,"Being a big fan of outre cinema, I own a slew of movie review books. While this book has it's flaws (see other reviews), it is still one of the best. Videohound covers more territory, but then it doesn't focus on just the weird and the wonderful, its reviews are too brief, and it's not as fun to read."
5,Michael Weldon conquers stuffy critics once more!,"First off, I recommend you get the first volume, the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FILM before getting this VIDEO GUIDE. Though this book is excellent in every way (except for the inclusion of so many action flicks), it is necessary to have both books. VIDEO GUIDE goes into newer films and neglects most of the timeless older flicks that we grew up with. Well, at least most of us, I'm only 15. The odd thing about this book is that it moves from the ""outcast"" section of a video store to the inner depths of ""popular"" categories, such as ACTION, COMEDY & DRAMA. So, get the ENCYCLOPEDIA first, then dive right into this excellent book and you will see how much more interesting and grand ""psychotronic"" films are than your everyday movie."
2,Almost there,"The book starts off rather well and gives the reader a good run toward believing the idea that a young woman has fallen for a ghost that has returned to save the town of Fury and a big piece of Arapaho land from miners who are only after the Almighty Dollar. However, the end becomes too reminiscent of ye old TV series Dark Shadows."
4,Great Supernatural Read!!,"If you like something different to read like ghost stories, you'll love this book by Elizabeth Hallam. The characters you read about are wonderful, real, heart warming. This book kind of leaves you thinking if a ghost can really be something real.. Who knows? Read the book."
1,Stinky!,"I received the baby balm by Burt's Bees as a gift and used it for about a week on my growing belly bump.. Until I couldn't take the smell any more. Chalking it up to my ultra-sensitive pregnancy nose, and not realizing that the whole product line smelled the same, I purchased the talc free powder. The stink is unreal! It got tossed almost immediately and the smell was so bad I washed the baby."
4,powder,"really liked it, will buy again...not through website though. I bought two Burt's Bees products and they send it separately from the same location...so I payed double shipping!!"
5,"Somewhere between Jaqui and Briana, but not going South","While Gaze has a similar quality to many previous releases from this unique band, it also goes further in many respects. First, we have a new female vocalist in Alison ""Lady"" Wheeler. At first listen I could have sworn I was hearing Jaqui. Listen closely though and on a track like Get Here you can hear a distinct similarity to Briana as well.As for some of the other tracks, I dare anyone to try to get Let Go With The Flow out of their head after just two or three listens. It has a hook that goes beyond any other Beautiful South tune. On Life Vs. The Lifeless we hear an almost reggae approach that is most refreshing.There are, of course, other tracks that are 100% Beautiful South. Just a Few Things That I Ain't, Sailing Solo, and Angels and Devils are quintessential Heaton/Rotheray songs, with the rhyme and melody that can only be penned by such tunesmiths. Not a weak track on the entire disc."
2,Routine,"I love the Beautiful South, I do, but Gaze is the work of a band in stasis. There are wonderful songs here, full of their trademark sarcasm and gentleness, such as ""Pretty"" and ""101% Man"". But there's also routine in it. ""Just a Few Things That I Ain't"" marries its wicked lyric to the melody of ""Cool Jerk"". And none of the others tracks have impressed themselves on my mind after months of listening."
3,"Solid, just.","If you already know The Beautiful South, there's not much new here. Which could be a good thing, cause I never understood the desire for change. But I don't get the feeling they really worked on improving what they had.Apparently TBS has always had interesting lyrics, but I never really hear them, it's all about the music and melody to me. And those are good. All songs swing at some level, nice and relax.I still prefer Brianna's voice though.Best songs: Live vs The Lifeless, Sailing Solo and Half of Him.[edit:] Let Go With the Flow's getting catchy.Altogether, it's nice, but I'm missing the melodies they had on the first 3 albums, and Blue... Doubtful if there'll be hits off this one."
5,Electronica with a twist for Absolute Beginners,"You've heard some tracks by this great electro-lounge German combo in several compilations (Bhudda Bar, Hotel Costes, etc.) You like them and you want to buy one of their albums but... which one? O.K. Hesitate no more, my friend, buy this one as it contains the best (and I mean the best!) tracks from their first three albums (Detunized Gravity, Godsdog and Death By Chocolate). But better be warned: after you hear this magnificent compilation, maybe you get infected by their groovy elegant sounds and need to buy the albums (as myself). Enjoy the party!"
5,The only tweezers my wife will use!,"What can I say, my wife has tried a whole bunch of different tweezers.While these are by far the most expensive, they are by far the best and well worth it.Bottom line, the points are super fine and stay aligned!That seems to be the biggest problem with the less expensive tweezers, the points very quickly go out of alignment and basically cross instead of grabbing."
3,"Good, if you can dance","The moves in this workout are highly complicated for an aerobic workout. It could be an excellent workout if you are into nightclubbing but is not suitable for the novice. The complicated steps cause you to stop often just to figure out what to do, therefore it is hard to get a good workout. If you're looking for something straightforward and basic, this is not it. If you like to dance, then you'll enjoy this fast paced workout."
4,"Fun, funky, hope you like to dance!","This is a fun video set to Paula's own music, but it's not for the beginning exerciser! If you're looking to put a little more funk, variety, and fun in your otherwise ho-hum routine that you've suffered for a few years.. this is the video for you. This may also make you pretty popular at the dance clubs once you learn the routines and get into the groove!"
3,A little chessy !,"I bought this tape in 2000. I enjoyed this workout for about a month and finally had enough. Don't get me wrong you can get a good cardio workout. But I found the music, instructor,the dancers and costumes annoying. I would not recommend this video to anyone unless I time traveled back to 1995!"
1,"Right package, wrong dvd!","I owned the video years ago and wanted it again because it really is a great video. Completely ticked when it arrived in the correct package but was something totally different on the dvd even though the dvd was even labeled correct. The outfit she has on on the cover and the pic from the ""correct"" clip of the video is correct, but on the dvd there are different people, different outfits, and whack dancing. I am so disappointed. :("
2,The Camera loves Paula,I just did this routine and found it extremely poorly cued compared to other dance/cardio routines I have done. I think part of it is that it was shot in 1995 but she only gives you 2 chances to learn the steps and then it goes to tempo which is a very fast tempo. The thing I found most offensive is that the cameraman was constantly focusing on Paula's FACE rather than her FEET while you were trying to learn the steps. It is definitely a good cardio workout but I'll save my cardio on a better cued routine.
3,More mentally than physically challenging,"What should be fun was very frustrating for me. Each ""step"" Abdul mentions is actually a combination of between 4 and 10 different moves. She does a poor job naming the steps and the camera doesn't follow the feet slow enough, so there is a steep learning curve if you don't have a dance background. The last song, which is led by some of the other dancers, is the best and easiest to follow along, but I still didn't feel as worked-out physically at the end of the routine as I'm used to feeling. Overall I was disappointed and must continue my quest for a superb cardio dance tape."
4,Decent workout,"I've had this video for five years, and I used to use it a lot before completely stopping my exercise routine. I alternated it with Kathy Smith's videos, and while it took me a few tries to memorize the steps, once I had them down the workout was easy. I was out of breath and sweating by the time I got done. It gives you a really good cardio workout. Definitely worth a try for a fun workout that doesn't seem like work."
3,"Great music, great energy, difficult steps","My 20-year-old daughter loves this tape. I'm 48 and I do step aerobics regularly but I could not pick up the steps after three attempts. My daughter, however, caught on easily and really got into the moves and the music and frequently works out to this tape. She loves Paula's choreography."
4,"good workout, not a dance lesson","This is a good dance-y workout, but you won't be using any of these steps on a dance floor these days! Very fast-paced (you can either stop and rewind to learn the steps, or just pick them up over a few days, as I did) and a lot of fun -- high energy, cheery, not annoying. You really will see results if you stick with it. If you do it on carpet, just be careful with the twists, use strength so you don't twist your knee instead of your whole body, and know your limits."
5,"It took awhile, but that's the point!!","My sister and I bought this video and when we tried it the first time, well, it was a bit funny. We couldn't catch up and we had to pause several times.You know what??? That's the great thing about this video! I couldn't wait to try it again. The second time we did the video, it was easier, but we still needed practice. Now, after several weeks, we have the routine down pat. Most exercise videos get boring after one or two tries. Not so with this video.The abs at the end of the video are long enough to get your muscles burning, but short enough that you don't want to stop the video altogether.We are definitely going to buy the other Paula Abdul video, any workout tape that convinces me to come back to it is worth its weight in gold!"
3,Fast Pace Dancing Workout,"First, I want to say, that the people that are dancing on this tape, had hours of practice....I agree with Madison, WI. I tried this with sneakers on carpet, and you are unable to move as fast as Paula. I became discouraged, and almost gave the tape away. But I tried again, with socks on, and found I had better movement. But Paula goes to fast for me, so I am breaking down the video into ""little dances"", and when I master one, I go on to the next dance. All the time getting closer and closer to doing the complete tape in one session. Otherwise, I found this tape to be a nice break from other dance tapes, more upbeat and hip."
2,Warning for those who exercise on carpeting,"Paula's a great dancer, but when this video was choreographed she forgot that many of us work out on carpeting. This video incorporates many twisting and turning moves which are probably great on a wood or tile floor, but doing them on carpeting could injure your knees. Be careful!"
5,Great workout dance video,"This dance video provides exactly what it said it would, ""a dance workout."" Paula herself conveyed that she disliked traditional workout tapes and aerobic classes because they were not as much fun as dancing. Thus, she created a workout of ""pure"" dance moves which would give the same effect of an aerobic workout... True, this workout takes some effort on the participants' part to learn the dance steps, and may be challenging for a first time dancer... however, once again, it is a ""dance"" workout tape. So if you don't want to incorporate dancing into your workout, this video is not for you. Over all I give her instruction technique and choice of dance moves 5 stars, as it was very suitable dance movement for a good calorie burning, toning and shaping dance workout, and at a great price too!"
4,This is hip-hop,"I just want people to know that this is a hip-hop workout and difficult for some of us due to all the jumps, twists, and general joint-popping. I would have liked to have known that before I ordered it."
2,This video is frustrating!,"I love Paula Abdual, but this video is too hard for begginer. The video really moves too fast to learn the steps. It would take at least a week of trying and rewinding to be able to keep up."
2,"good music, too hard to follow for beginners...","I will admit that Paula is inspirational BUT she doesn't give you enough time to ""learn"" the move before putting you in full gear. I loved the music and Paula's upbeat personality but felt it moved way too fast. This video will definitely get your heart a pumpin'."
5,A Bit Tricky,"This video is a bit tricky and very fast paced. The first time I tried it, I thought there was no way I would be able to do it! But I took one section a day for a few days to learn the steps. Once you get the steps, its not that bad. It does get you moving, there is a lot of jumping, and it will get you sweating before you know it! You'll enjoy this video if you don't mind taking time to learn the steps."
2,Stay on the shelf...,"This video is hard to follow. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands it will stay on the shelf. I am a good dancer, but could not learn the steps fast enough to keep up the pace. The steps are demonstrated one time slow and then fast and faster."
2,Not good for beginners,"I think this workout would be better if she took more time to teach you the moves. It's too complicated for beginners and you need to feel that you can get the moves, which will motivate you to continue with the workout. The tape does have potential, but she is not a good teacher. She can gain some insight some Gilad. He is a great teacher and alot of other aerobic stars can learn alot from his style."
5,It gives your body a good workout.,Overall the video was really charged with energy. Although you really need to know how to dance to get a good workout. The tape is an hour long so make sure you finish it all the way through or you will have very sore muscles.
3,Whew,"Proof that ability doesn't equate with teaching ability, Paula Abdul doesn't take the time to break some of the trickier steps down, and counting isn't the same as explaining. Camera work doesn't help. The first time I tried this, I ended up changing tapes in the middle to finish my workout because I was getting too frustrated and my heart rate was going up and down with the stop-and-start required. I might return to the tape later to try and learn the routine in increments.The steps also were kind of hard on these old knees."
2,Not for beginners,This tape went too fast for me to pick up the steps. Very frustrating and a waste of money. I donated it to our library :)
1,Very disappointing :-(,"I really wanted to enjoy this video, but I hate the way it was shot. It's very important to be able to follow the routine. However the camera was all over the place. Also, there were too many people behind Paula. It was a big disappointment because I wanted to find new exercise routines that incorporated dance. I like Paula and really hoped this video would be worth buying. Luckily I'm smart enough to check things out of the library before purchasing anything."
2,Way Too Difficult,"I have two left feet anyways and this video was not helpful to me at all. There is no way someone like me can follow these steps because Paula doesn't really instruct you on each move. With all her and the dancers' ""Oh, just stick with it..."" tripe, you'd think they'd keep in mind that everyone using the workout isn't Wade Robson or Justin Timberlake. Gosh. Paula says the gazillion people in the video with her are ""normal folks"". Oh, please. I guess you can catch on to this tape after watching and rewinding a million times, even though I've had it six years and I still hate it and can't get through the warmup. I guess I could learn this tape if I really wanted to but I want to burn fat, not learn how to be Britney Spears. If you're one of those people who catches on easily Get Up And Dance may work for you. Maybe. But if you're looking for a good fat burning workout without all the hassel, I recommend Peak Fat Burning by Kathy Smith or something of the like."
4,Challenging but entertaining and fun,"I have suddenly become a workout video tape maniac and I need to keep alot of variety in my workout schedule. Being a stay-at-home mother of 2 small girls I was feeling out of touch with the world. This video was SO fun. I don't know how much aof a workout I had because I have only done it once, but I felt like a dancer. The moves are quite difficult, but I have only done it once and I know after a few times I will feel like I could be on that video. It was very fun and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to put some fun and funk into their workout routine."
4,Challenging!,"I never had much appreciation for this video until I bought a Richard Simmons aerobics video.. Then I realized what a great workout Paula gives! This video is challenging.. At 60 minutes, I've never been able to do the whole thing at once. The warm-up itself is a workout! The dance moves can be tricky, but you'll get the hang of them eventually. This video is guaranteed to get your heart rate way up there. It's a real challenge.. I was working out with Richard Simmons' ""Disco Sweat"" for about 15 minutes and was barely out of breath! Paula will get you moving and make you feel great! Give it a try."
3,terrible camera work,"Not easy by any means, which is not necessarily a bad thing, since at least for me, a challenge keeps me coming back for more. BUT! This video is much more frustrating than it has to be because of the poor camera work. Throughout the video, the camera keeps cutting between shots above her waist, shots from above and far away, shots of her students from funny angles, and shots even of her on what seems to be a monitor tv of some sort. AHHH!! Especially when she is teaching a step and all you want to do is just watch her feet transition from one move to the next, the camera keeps shifting just to confuse you some more.I'm definitely not coming back to this one."
2,Wasn't impressed,"This video reminded me more of a music video than a workout tape. There were too many camera angles and really no instruction. In the beginning there was something said about some of the people in the video have never danced before but everyone was well practiced and danced as if they were part of a dance troop. I found it hard to keep up with the tape. The end was rather silly with the ""spontaneous"" YMCA dance directed by a group of guys before the cool down. Thank god I found Donna Richardson workout tapes!"
1,To FAST... little instruction,"This tape was not good at all, for a beginner espeacially. I tried it twice and gave up, and I have taken dance lessons a lot when I was younger. Very little instruction was involved, the lighting was bad, and all the people in the tape were distracting. I would say this tape is good for someone that has MUCH experience in fast paced dance. I give it two thumbs down."
3,No Good Songs!,I thought I was going to get a dance routine to straight up and forever your girl. Too bad it was just generic music except for promise of a new day warm up. I liked Cheryl Burke's DVD much better because they use real songs that I can dance to. Disapointed.
5,LOVE IT!!!!!! Glad I found it on DVD!!!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS WORKOUT AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT EVER SINCE I LENT IT TO MY SISTER AND NEVER RECEIVED IT BACK... AN INTENSE ROUTINE THAT IS FUN! IF YOU ARE SLOW TO BEGIN WORKING OUT BUT LOVE TO DANCE YOU WILL ENJOY THIS EXCERCISE... IT DOESNT EVEN FEEL LIKE EXCERCISE BUT YOU WILL DEFINITELY NOTICE A DIFFERENCE! I GIVE THIS 5 STARS JUST FOR THE MOTIVATION IF THE ROUTINE AND HOW PAULA EXPRESSES THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN, CUZ ITS A VIDEO... NOBODY CAN SEE OR JUDGE YOU! INSPIRING!"
5,Easy & Lots of Fun,"If you are below active level, it would be tough for the first time you follow Paula. But I did it. After 2nd time work out with the tape, I surely improve my speed and dancing style, more important is I notice my muscle is firmer and I eat less.....WOW"
1,what was I thinking!!!,If you are a great dancer maybe but if you are normal plan to spend a lot of time being confused by the steps.
2,Please Stop The Bad Behavior,"Too much! Too much for an old girl, anyway. I could have gone to the local gym with the 20 year olds if I wanted to jump all over the place! I think either this video is dated or I am - - outdated."
1,Annoying And Complicated!,"This is the worst workout tape ever for a beginner. The fact that most people work out on carpet and cant do her moves on carpet make it difficult to start with, also they move so fast that its even more difficult to follow for a beginner or non-dancer. I did play the tape all of the way through and attempted a few times to do the workout. I couldnt listen to the whole thing (had to turn the volume off to keep from going insane) because the entire tapes dance music is her song ""Promise of a new day"" The ETERNAL REMIX FROM HELL! Gilad is by far the safest, easiest and most effective workout I have tried. Paula go back to cheerleading & music because an aerobics instructor your not!"
1,"Even if you can dance, this video is horrible!!!","Without question, this is the worst aerobics video I've ever done. I acutally gave it away after the first time I did it. I own a lot of aerobics videos, take aerobics classes, and took dance classes when I was younger. I know how to dance and can pick up on routines quickly. But this video is horrible. The moves are impossible to follow. Some of the moves involve so much fancy footwork that you're destined to twist your knee if you're trying to do the steps on a carpeted floor like I was. Anyway, do yourself a favor and find another video."
4,"A little tricky, but a fun cardio workout","This workout sounded really fun to me, because up until this year I danced professionally (modern and ballet), so most workout videos don't get my heart rate up as much as I'd like. I agree with some of the other reviewers about Paula's teaching- the first time watching this video, I spent quite a bit of time sort of hopping in place to keep myself moving, while trying to pick up the steps, becasue they weren't explained very well at all. However, the second/third time through, it gets easier, and is a lot of fun. However, the whole thing is REALLY dated (it is Paula Abdul, I guess), so I still prefer Carmen Electra's videos to this one, but they're a good combination- this for cardio, the other for toning."
2,Poor instruction,The camera doesn't stay still long enough for you to actually see the dancers move. I won't use it again - wish I never bought it
2,"Ok workout, if you can follow","This video is definately not for beginners. It is hard to follow if you are not used to moving you body that quickly!!! After about several times of watching the same sequence over and you can finally begin to follow the moves. The warmup is pretty fun though. It is different than most warmups. The ab workout is also, not so bad. It is just the dance moves that are so complicated. If you can follow them, it is a good workout. If you have trouble following regular aerobics videos, dont buy this one. You find yourself getting more of a finger workout from rewinding so many times just to try and follow along."
4,Good workout,"I accually give this four & 1/2 stars since it is such a great workout. Some of the moves are a bit dated (sorry but I thougt the YMCA part was annoying) but I still like this one. Overall, I would still recommend this DVD to add to any dance-arobic collection.(If you're into dance exercise DVDs I highly recommend Quickfix Cardio hip hop with Juliane Arney. It's really good.)"
2,Too difficult,"The moves in this are great, but I did this with several fairly coordinated family members and it was very difficult. I never have managed to master it. She makes a passing attempt at teaching you the moves, but a couple of times she actually completely skips teaching you the move and just does it at the speed of light and expects you to get it. It was freggin sadistic. I'd rather have an impossibly difficult video with good moves than an unbearably easy video, however, so it gets two stars. If you pick up stuff fast and easily, this would probably be a good investment. Also, the set and costumes made me laugh a lot, way too old. Fortunately, most of the moves survive the test of time and you won't look like a dork on the dance floor."
4,Fun Workout...,"Paula Abdul serves up a fun and interesting workout. The music and some of the dance moves (like the football drill and others)are a little out of style now. But that doesn't mean that they aren't fun in your own home. And despite having two left feet, I was able to perform a reasonable imitation of the dance moves after watching the video a couple times. And I do get a good workout during the 45 minute video. Overall, a great video to learn some basic steps while enjoying an areobic workout."
4,great pan,"I use this pan all the time, and I really like it.The one thing I don't like is that there's water with rust in it that comes from the edges of the pan after I wash it off.I have to use a special towel when drying it; one that I don't care if it gets stained."
3,Not as good as previus CD's-3.5 Stars actually,"I was highly anticipating this release but was very dissapointed. I did not find any memorable tracks on this one. He is an excellent artist and it was tolerable, but there are no catchy tracks that I had press repeat on. Overall, I would pass on this outing and but the last two offerings."
5,Excellent Fantasy story,"I read this book as an adult several years ago. I am a fan of fantasy books like Wrinkle in Time series, The Narnia Cronicals, and now the Harry Potter series. This book is as good, if not better then those. I now have children of my own and I just finished reading it to them and they love it. My daughter, like me, wish that there was a book 2, 3, 4,....In my youth I had the distict pleasure of working for a time with Mr. John Duel and I think back often with fond memories of his amazing wit, creativity, patience, and humanity.I hope some day he will add to the Dreamland story. We are patiently waitng."
5,"Adventurous, Fun Read for All Ages","I enjoyed reading Wide Awake in Dreamland -- a wonderful, adventure for kids of all ages. If you like the Harry Potter stories, or the Wizard of Oz, you will love this book! Once you start on the adventure, it will be hard to put the book down! Well-written, full of imaginative twists and turns, and likable characters. Highly recommended."
3,Would have paid no more then $12,"I felt robbed after paying $30 and when opening the box found a plastic pitcher with simple insert. I brought this to work where there is not a dish washer so in little time the inside of the insert started to stain where I could not reach to physically wash it off. been using the pitcher for 1 year now, looking back on this product I should have looked at the picture just realized its a $30 plastic pitcher and nothing more, moved on and found a $12 plastic pitcher."
4,Pitcher is GREAT!,"I think this product is wonderful! It's exactly what I wanted! I can make iced tea with loose leaves or I can be creative and make strawberry or cucumber-flavored water! My only complaint is that it's too tall and it does not fit in my fridge without lifting the shelf. I wish that the height had been given in the description. Other than that, it's perfect!"
3,"Good enough, not great","This makes good iced tea, but the design leaves a lot to be desired. The handle is at the top, so when full I need two hands to lift it - not balanced well at all. Also, the diffuser is not anchored in any way, so it floats around the pitcher when you are filling with water. Oh, and the worst, most annoying part is that the top won't stay open. The slightest touch makes it slam shut. Just hard to handle overall."
2,not up to Bodum standards,"I really wanted to like it but I can't recommend this product. The construction is flimsy, particularly the lid and its attachment to the pitcher. I can see this breaking. The infuser insert slips out of its track easily, which is a minor annoyance but it just makes the thing feel cheap. The deal-breaker for me is that the infuser lets tons of tea leaves escape. I tried to brew green tea and there were so many tea leaves that escaped through the infuser that I had to pour it all out through a strainer into another container, totally defeating the purpose of this pitcher. It might work for you if you are infusing large sprigs of tea, herbs, etc. but it was useless for green tea leaves. Bodum typically makes great stuff. This is a disappointing exception. I'll think twice before buying anything plastic from Bodum in the future."
1,Not Worth It,"Thought this was a great pitcher with only minor things that could be perfected, but that was before it started to crack. I don't even use boiling water. Ot started with one crack after about 8 months, but it is now about to fall apart there are so many cracks only 3 months later. For the price, this should be a lot better. I'm very disappointed."
2,"Worked okay for 1.5 years, still searching for *real* iced tea pitcher","I bought two of these about 18 months ago. The product immediately warped from the hot water to the point that the infusers would stick and jam when being inserted or removed, so I stopped using the infusers.The plastic also immediately stained from the iced tea, and no amount of scrubbing would clean them.Today, when pouring the hot water into one of them I heard a distinct ""crack"" sound, and looked down to see a crack along the side. The entire reason I bought a non-glass pitcher was so that it would survive being doused with boiling hot water.So, one of my two pitchers is dead, they do a workmanlike job as tea pitchers, but I'll look elsewhere for replacements."
3,Decent product but..,Not sure why Bodum chose to design the lid so you cannot remove it from the base. The farthest the lid goes is straight up so it's difficult to wash and clean inside.
2,Iced-tea maker,"When I saw the size of the container, I was excited to find an iced-tea maker that I could make large quantities at one time. However when I pulled it out of the box I was a bit disappointed, though I kept it and do use it a lot. It is cheaply made platstic, but the real problem is with the filter. I like all kinds of loose tea, and some are very fine leaves. The filter on this product is terrible. Does not filter fine leaves, they end up in the main part of resevoir. I end up using a mesh metal coffee filter to pour the tea into glass or into another container. It works fine but ridiculous that Bodum put such a cheap filter in this product."
2,Other reviews were right on,"I received this last week and used it twice. I so desperately wanted the other reviews about the design flaws to be wrong but they weren't. The lid is flimsy. I am so afraid it is going to snap right off when I am making the tea or cleaning it. They should have just made the lid lift all the way off like the rubbermaid pitchers, duh. Instead it's attached by this little piece of cheesy plastic that sticks up and gets in the way. You can see it next to the handle in the picture. Also the loose tea leaves do seep right through the little holes in the filter.I just love the size of this. I couldn't find another one that brews loose tea in this size anywhere on the web. I am considering returning it."
1,Please don't waste your money!,I bought this last year at a Whole Foods store. It worked well for about two months and then sprang a leak on the seam where it was joined. Whole Foods couldn't take it back (since I didn't have the forsight to save the receipt!) and Bodum didn't answer my emails.Next time I will just use a glass pitcher!
1,Tea on the stove,I ordered this item roughly 6 months ago. Everything was working fine. Tonight I added hot watter and it split the plastic. It spring a leak spraying almost boiling water on my hand then all over the stove.
2,Hard to clean,"I thought the infuser was a good idea and the large size would let me brew enough tea to last awhile. However, I didn't realize that the top is not removable, making dishwasher washing impractical. We couldn't keep it clean enough by hand. And, I realized that it was really too large - it was hard to handle with one hand when full and too tall to fit easily into the refrigerator."
3,"works well, for a while, then cracks","We bought this about 2 years ago and it is just now starting to crack. (granted we haven't used it that regularly). I came to amazon to replace it but forgot how expensive it was. After reading the comments of others with cracking issues I'm going to look at other options. But if you put boiling water in it about once a month for 2 years, it should last that long for you."
2,"Great, but lid broke after 8 months","This has been a great pot for Lipton's Cold Brew even though it stains quickly. However, the lid broke rather quickly. I emailed Bodumbut never got a response."
3,Filter hard to clean,"Although many people mention the ""flimsy lid"" that ""looks"" like it will break, I can tell you I've had this for two years and the lid has withheld fine with almost daily use. It's not the strongest lid in the world, but in my experience if you treat it like a regular pitcher- as in don't stand on it or use it as a football- the lid should last fine. The annoying thing is cleaning the pitcher with this undetachable lid that flops up and down while cleaning. The worst part though is the filter which is not easy to clean at all because it's long and narrow and you can't really get your hand up there to get out all the clinging tea leaves. The holes are also too big for loose tea- but the directions say it's for whole tea leaves so it doesn't lose points for that. Just for the filter being hard to clean & the lid being detachable. However it does do it's job in making good iced tea."
2,Tiny tea leaves pieces slip through the holes.,This is not what I expected when I bought this tea maker/pitcher. Fresh loose tea slips right through the cracks and holes of the container. Very mislead by these great reviews. I would not buy or recommend to anyone. I wish I had bought the other one by Takeya. I will be buying it very soon and using the Bodum for extra tea.
4,A good place to start,"I read this book four years ago. I have an interest in 18th century history and I wanted to know more about the religious beliefs and disagreements that would have been in the minds of 18th century thinkers. This book did a decent job teaching me what I wanted to know, but I wasn't captivated by it. It's such a big subject that it's hard to make a sharply defined story out of it. The bibliographical notes give a large number of references to other books that could be useful to readers who want to know more, and also specialist literature, which is probably only useful to the scholar."
5,Explains not just the Reformation but most of Human Nature,"Explains not just the reformation, but also: government, the modern world, bureaucracy, innovation, how to get things done in organization; and in fact most of human nature.Well written, detailed but readable, unbiased, professional.One of the best books I have ever read."
5,A brilliant book from a great author,"This book deservedly joins the classics by Euan Cameron and Owen Chadwick on the Reformation. It looks at it as it really happened - this is based on solid scholarship and years of careful research. Those wanting a more partisan history will not find it here (my own FIVE LEADING REFORMERS should be more to the tastes of those that do) but as an objective work, looking at the Reformation in the wider context of European, and later global,history, this book cannot be bettered. For those of us who loved this author's CRANMER and then his TUDOR CHURCH MILITANT, this is the big book from him for which we have all been waiting. Make sure your library has a copy, and that your professor and/or pastor have read it. Christopher Catherwood, author of FIVE LEADING REFORMERS (CFP, 2000) and of CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
2,the disabled scholar,"This history of the Reformation is a scholarly document and many reviewers have praised its quality. I found it to be comparable to milk in a locked refrigerator...you know its there...but its just not accessible. Mr. MacCulloch's research is exhaustive, however, his ability as a writer does not offer the reader any real discernment of either the forest or the trees. If your goal is understanding what happened in the 16th century, I suggest a much briefer history by Glenn S. Sunshine, who indeed, does present a much more enlightening work. Great scholarship, in the case of Mr. MacCulloch, is cloaked in the mediocrity of his writing skill."
1,"Trashily done, sir!","I was prompted to begin reading ""The Reformation"" by a number of laudatory reviews. Begin reading was all I could take. Within the first 25-30 pages Mr MacCulloch reveals that he is ignorant of the Catholic understanding of what the Eucharist is, believes that the doctrine of the Assumption states that the mother of Jesus did not die (sorry, dude, no one gets out of here alive), and has clearly never spoken with a Catholic religious or priest about his choice of celibacy (sorry, it's not a job requirement). While promising to guide his reader into the minds of European Christians of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, he shows little ability to get there himself, and insists on judging the people of that era by two of the preoccupations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, viz., political power and sexual abandon. I shuddered to think what further misinformation lay ahead, tore up the book, and tossed it into the trash."
2,Atlantic Isles?,A dull work. I couldn't get past the first few chapters. His silly kow-towing to political correctness by referring to the British Isles as the Atlantic Isles didn't help.
1,Why did this win an award ?,Please explain to me why this book won a prestigious award ? It is a murky muddle with a silly claim to objectivity that is obviously a lie. Just because you do not hold to a belief system does not mean you are automatically objective about it. This guy dances all around important issues and pivotal historical characters precisely because he indeed does have a strong bias. If you want to read an excellent history of the Reformation avoid this book. There are a number of excellent studies already done by real historians that are readily obtained.
4,Good but not great,"This book was an excellent read...though it took a while. It was well written, although it tended to wander off the point from time to time. It is certainly thorough, even somewhat repetitive. If a point was a good one evidently it was worth hammering home. I am a person of no religious conviction but I thought there was a noticeable pro-Protestant bias to the account of the doings of the two major divisions of Christendom. I found some of his terms odd (""magisterial Protestantism"" for example) though by and large I think I know what he meant. I gave the book only four stars rather than five because while fascinating I felt it had real flaws."
3,Not for the layman!!!,"This is a difficult book for me to rate. On one hand, it was full of fascinating details and insights into life and politics in Medieval Europe. On the other hand, the sheer amount of detail is absolutely overwhelming. It's both a stunning achievement and an absolute chore to work through. At times I felt as if we were getting an intimate history of every monastery, hamburg, and duchy in Europe.It was much too much for a layperson, and I have a relatively good knowledge of European history. As an intro to the Reformation: 2 stars. For those with a strong background in the field: 4 stars."
3,Good But Not Great,This work is more a theological history of the Reformation than a straight forward cultural and political history. I was frankly disppointed and found myself perferring Will Durant's now hoary work.
1,Riddled with typographical errors,"I would highly recommend the book except that it is riddled with typographical errors through out. In most of the errors, whole words are broken up with a space in between the parts of the words. I am not sure whether it is the responsibility of the publisher or Amazon to have the book fixed and replace the currently flawed one. I personally feel that it is simply unacceptable to have this level of errors occurring in a book that is offered for sale. So in conclusion, get the printed book and avoid the ebook all together till it is fixed."
4,Thorough but a hard read,"This was a very thorough book and I won't go into it since the other reviews cover that well.I am suprised that no one has really mentioned the difficulty in understanding concepts presented in the book. The author glosses over things that he assumes the reader already knows. I have taken a college level course in religion, so I am not unfamiliar with basic concepts, but my knowledge of Erasmus and Animism is lacking (not to mention a few others). Without this you miss much of the detail. I finished the book but I cannot say that my knowledge of specific incidents grew much. I think I got more out of this book in terms of overall impression of the life and times with respect to the church.Overall a quality book. Not everyone may be ready for it though."
4,Nice album,"This is Brazilian Rap with some rock, and Brazilian music, flavor. Pretty good album, some great songs, but also a couple of weak ones. Not as good as his first one."
4,Red geometric necklace,"This was an interesting looking, inexpensive necklace for a teen aged girl. It was a cute, vintage look, and she was quite happy with it."
5,"Finally, an I Ching book for the REST of us.","OK, maybe I'm slightly biased (co-author Amy __is__ my mom and I __did__ write the foreward) but I still think this is one of the best new books on the I-Ching in twenty years. The fact is, most books on the I-Ching are arcane and difficult to understand and make this wonderful tool for decision-making almost impossible to use. Amy and Rod's book makes it easy for regular (i.e. non-academic) people to use the I-Ching in their daily life. What more could you want?If you're an academic student of the I-Ching, then you'll want to review this book for general ideas about a different, more ""utilitarian"" approach than Wilhelm and others. However, if you're a person who just wants to find an interesting entry into a thousand-year-old divination tool, then you'll LOVE this book.And please, let me know if you disagree.Charlie"
5,Easy to use,"This is an excellent practical explanation of the I Ching, making it easy to use. I have a few I Ching books, but this is by far the easiest to understand and use for daily divination. Even the book construction makes it an awesome tool - the page edges are rough, making it easy to flip through and the back page diagram of upper/lower trigrams makes finding the right trigram number simple."
3,Not my favorite.,"Not enough conflict, too predictable, not enough character development. I really was expecting more from Nicholas Sparks. A really, really, fast read."
2,Boring,"I know I'm preforming the cardinal sin of writing a book review but I'm a little over 55% done with the book and it is dragging! Its increasingly repetitive, very dull, with a page here and there of excitement. Its definitely not worth the 6 bucks."
1,BORRRRRRINGGGGG!,"I can't believe over 200 people gave this five stars. I love to read, but I'd rather read the back of a soup can than waste any more time on this one."
4,Loved it!,"I really enjoyed this book, I really felt for the characters and most importantly felt a connection to them. One of Sparks better efforts here!"
4,This was a pretty good book,"This book was pretty good, however compared to hi other books The Notebook and A Walk to Remember i expected a little more. However this book adds just as much emotion as the other books that i have read by him. Nicolas Sparks brings unreal situations to life. The way he depicts a single mother's life with an abnormal child very well for a man who does not live that life. At times however the story got a little slow but otherwise it is still a very good story written by a good author. After reading his other books however i expected more from Nicolas Sparks."
3,Just Okay,"I enjoyed this book, but it was a little too predictable. Nothing so far compares to ""Message in a Bottle."""
3,An Entertaining Read,"This is the third book that I've read by Nicholas Sparks and I thought that it was very well written, though predictable. The character of Denise as the strong, independent single mother to Kyle was one of the best qualities of the novel. I was moved by the strength of her love for her child and the fact that she had pretty much given up her life to help him overcome his learning and speech disability.I also liked Taylor's character and the fact that the author didn't give us the full details of why this character behaved the way he did. We knew that his father died at a young age but not the events leading up to that death. It was interesting to see them unfold.The relationship between Taylor and Denise was predictable but I like a good love story!Though I enjoyed this book, I would have to say that I thought his earlier novel, ""A Walk to Remember"" was by far the better story."
2,Definitely not Spark's best,"As a diehard Sparks fan, I was truly disappointed in the ""Danielle Steel"" formulaic writing. Unlike his previous books, this was predictable, simple and after the first few chapters, boring. It was a struggle to finish. I will keep buying his books, hoping this was an aberration of his normally beautiful writing."
2,Ungodly book,"After watching and reading ""A Walk to Remember"" I was very interested in reading more of Sparks books.I'm very sorry to realize he is not the writer I was hoping to find. God's word is very clear about fornicationand how fornicator's will not enter into His rest. The ""Notebook"" also had this as part of the story. People make mistakes but it should be clear that there are consequenses for our sin."
2,The rescue,Probably my least favorite Sparks to date but still glad that I read it. Very slow starting but redeemed itself in the end. I am still a Sparks fan and have found all of his books worthwhile.
3,Good but not good enough,"I enjoyed the book but I suspect it is because I enjoy the writing of Nicholas Sparks. I thought the plot was very predictable. (I can't go into much detail without giving it away). Suffice it to say about halfway through the book, I knew exactly how it was going to end."
4,Tugs at your Heart Strings,"After reading several Sparks love stories, The Rescue is not my favorite. However, it's a good book. Especially if you enjoy romance with a little bit of intrigue.This is the story of two people who have each individually been through a lot of tragedy and conflict in their past. The question is, once the find each other, and a love they never thought they would find, can they make it work?I enjoyed the book, Sparks writing always pulls you in and tugs at your heart strings. I don't think I've ever read one of his books and NOT cried. I especially enjoyed The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. His books are also always ""fun reading"", great to take on a vacation or to read at the beach. If you haven't read him before, you should give him a try!"
3,Sweet book,"I read this book because I liked the movie A Walk to Remember. Actually, A Walk to Remember was really the book I wanted, but after I couldn't find it in the bookstores, I settled for the rescue. It wasn't a bad book, and it wasn't a book that I would say that I'm going to cherish forever.The story was interesting enough to keep me interested. It centered around a single mother who's son has a hard time learning and comprehending language, and a contractor/firefighter who's father died tragically making way for the ""I'll-never-love-a-woman"" promise. The characters were horribly cliched. He stuck the two lead characters in traditional male-female roles that. It even got a little corny in places, but the story was interesting enough to keep me reading. The author did a very good job at portraying a mother's love and determination to help her son. It was a sweet story that tugged at the heartstrings, but don't expect to find anything deep and profound here."
3,Pour on the Cheese!,"I've read and loved all the books by Nicholas Sparks, but this one was a little disappointing. First, it took a while to get in to (the beginning dragged on). After that, it picked up, but the ending was very predictable and very cheesy. Whatever you do though, DON'T READ THE EPILOGUE! That was what really ruined it for me. The story between Denise and Taylor was pretty realistic, but there were still some gaps there. It's a quick read and fairly enjoyable, so pick it up if you have a chance."
3,A Good Summer Read,"This book lacks the strong emotional impact of ""The Notebook"". Having read his other previous books which did not live up to ""The Notebook"" I was a little hesitant to pick this one up. I was afraid I'd be disappointed. Having said this, I found the book held my interest and was an enjoyable although somewhat predictable read. It is far better than ""Message in a Bottle""!"
3,Needed some rescuing,"Books of this genre tend to move me to tears and that is how I judge whether I like it or not. While reading Message in a Bottle I couldn't read the print for the flowing tears. At the outset of The Rescue, I thought I had hit upon another winner. Sparks certainly defines his characters both physically and emotionally, and draws you in. But somehow this one was too predictable almost from the start with a very sappy ending. However, by far better than A Walk to Remember, it emphasized what patience, love, and forgiveness can accomplish and what harboring negativity can lead to by not letting the past go. I must however credit him with writing successful stories without foul language, sex and violence which is commendable in this day and age. A big extra star for that! It was an enjoyable easy read but it is time for me to return to my courtroom mysteries, detectives and adventure stories."
3,"Great beginning, but YAWN! through the rest of it.","Unlike his other books, this one was not worth my money. The first 50 pages I couldn't put it down. After that I was fighting to stay awake. There is only so much thinking outloud I can take. What a disappointment from a great author."
3,First read by Nicholas Sparks,"I'm sure that I will tread on the toes of Sparks' fans when I write this, but honestly, this was an average novel. The plot was extremely predictable....so predictable, in fact, that I would have put the book down after the first chapter or so, but for the engaging style of Mr. Sparks. The writing style kept my attention long after the plot itself lost my interest.This is an okay piece of light fiction. Good for a brief break or a bit of reading before falling asleep.This is far from the worst novel I've ever read, but after reading it, I'm not sure that I want to read Mr. Sparks other works. I imagine that they will be about as predictable."
3,A predictable read...,"Though the love story (yes it is a love story!) was well written the storyline was predictable. It was pretty easy to figure out who was going to die.Taylor, the firefighter, gets involved with a single mother, Denise, after rescuing her handicapped son. His inability to truly commit and the reasons why slowly unfold. The easily predicted death makes that change.If you are truly a romance addict you will probably enjoy it but Message in a Bottle was much better!"
1,Wrong cover...very disappointed with Amazon.,"I ordered this book with the intention of receiving the edition with the original cover shown here. I received a book that looked completely different and was the wrong cover, and very different from what I was expecting. This is very poor on Amazon's part. If you want this book specifically with the original product, DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON. I will be returning the book for a refund, and will probably hesitate to ever use Amazon again. Very unprofessional, and I'm disgusted with their business."
3,"Fair story, strong characters","I enjoyed Nick Sparks's The Rescue but it was not as good as The Notebook. The Rescue held my interest, nevertheless, because I felt the characters were well developed and the relationships were strong ones. I give him special credit for presenting the child, Kyle, with so much consideration and respect. ..."
2,"Predictable, but read it if you're a Nicholas Sparks fan.","I love Nicholas Sparks so much, but this book was too predictable. The ""dark secret"" the guy had didn't surprise me.I cannot stress how much I love ""A Walk to Remember."" ^_^"
4,Another Winner,"I so enjoy Nicholas Sparks' writing. I am always totally amazed by the fact that these wonderful romance books have been written by a man.In the Rescue I was quickly drawn into the story of Taylor and Denise; two very lonely people who find each other on a stormy night because of a twist of fate. The centre of Denise's life is her son, Kyle. Unwed and raising a child with a learning disability, Denise has become a strong and independent woman. Taylor on the other hand jumps from relationship to relationship always avoiding that final commitment. Plagued by horrifying memories, Taylor is made to face yet more disaster in his life. The perfect meshing of two lives and true love.I look forward to Nicholas Spark's next book."
3,not as good as Nights in Rodanthe,"This is my second Sparks book, the first being Nights in Rodanthe, which I thought was excellent. As others have said, this one seems overly long, and I felt it lacks the poignancy of Nights in Rodanthe. Still a pleasant read, however...."
4,Nicholas Sparks creates heros out of ordinary people,"I love the way that Nicholoas Sparks creates heros out of ordinary people. It makes you feel like your own life is significant. His characters are always well developed, as in The Rescue. Without going into the storyline, which you can read the publisher's review, The Rescue will make you cry, and your heart will ache for these ""real"" people. It is a must read. Marjorie Spoto, Author, When It Rains."
3,Not the love story I was hoping for,"When I picked this book to read, I hadn't heard much about it or read any reviews. I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks and I was hoping that this book would be a love story. What I found was a story with a lot of drama in it and only a small love story. It was a little slow in the beginning. I was about halfway through the book and the relationship between the two main characters still wasn't very developed. Don't get me wrong, it was still an enjoyable read(and a tear-jerker!). It just wasn't the love story I was looking for."
3,Telegraph Hill,"I listened to the books on tape version. While the story was enjoyable, the ending was predictable. By tape 5 I felt pretty certain about Denise and Taylor, and the ""grand finale"" would involve fire and a loved one.Sure enough, pretty predictable. But a good time filler none-the-less."
2,Formulaic and forced,"The primary value of entertainment that I received from this book was the amusement as I wondered how much more inane and contrived the dialogue between Denise and Taylor could get. The conflicts feel very forced... As when Denise is so upset when he chooses to eat at work as opposed to spending EVERY waking and sleeping moment with him. I also found some of the word choices poor ""his mother looked at him with inexpressible sorrow""?? It was clearly expressible sorrow as he could see that it was SORROW. Irrepressible sorrow would have fit with his intent better.There was some redemption in the storyline between Taylor and Kyle. Certainly better than ""True Believer"" and ""At First Sight"" But overall, I would have been happier having not read it."
4,Real life characters,"This is the second novel by Nicholas Sparks that I've read and I truly enjoyed it. I found the characters to be very real and the struggles that both main characters go through to be heart wrenching at times. The foreshadowing was a bit predictible and easily to spot, but overall I enjoyed how real the setting and the characters were.As someone else pointed out, Taylor's ""fear of commitment"" was a bit much. He seemed so mentally unstable that I found it hard to believe at times he was able to function as a human being. Although, I do make it sound worse than it really was. By the end I was sort of glad Denise had reacted the way she did, albeit a bit late.I did shed a tear or two by the end of the book, so I think Sparks did what he set out to do. As much as I enjoyed this book, ""A Bend in the Road"" is still my favorite thus far."
4,fprincessmirei,"I have just recently finished The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks, another one of his wonderful works. This book is about a brave, single mother and a courageous volunteer firefighter, and how their friendship eventually blossoms into love. Nicholas Sparks brings back his original charm, and creates a whole other view that you can really tune into and understand. I give this book four stars because it is not one of Spark's best works, but the characters and the plot are what kept me hooked on to it.Comparing The Rescue to another one of Spark's works, The Notebook, The Rescue is without a doubt the winner. The Rescue has better characters, a better storyline, and a much better ending. The Notebook hooked me in the beginning, but near the end I lost interest. The Rescue kept me hooked the entire time. I could not put it down!"
3,"Great writing, Good characters, No plot","It takes a lot to stretch out an entire novel based on the following: Woman has troubled child, they wreck, are rescued by unmarried successful local guy who bonds with child and falls in love with woman. That's it. It was not a bad story or even a callous or sentimental one. I am a sucker for boy meets troubled gal, falls in love and they live happy ever after BUT...that kind of action is usually presented as simply one component in a more complex tale.Our hero has psychological problems dating back to his childhood, our heroine had sex one night with a guy she just met who, of course, refused to give her the time of day upon discovering the pregnancy. Just for real schmaltz we have mama (hero's mom) who was friends with heroine's mom & hero's best friend - in true Sparks fashion - must pass on to that library in the sky. Once again, this is not a bad book with bad writing, It is, however, a redundant one that needs a little more than what we are given."
4,The Rescue,I liked this book because every once in a while I need a little romantic getaway. I thought this one was better than other Nicholas Spark's books because it had more action and it didn't start out with a description of the woman's lame love life. It actually had some adventure to it.
5,Excellent Novel,"This was an excellent heartwarming novel. It hit close to home for me, and the book itself was just wonderful, I can't stress that enough! I could not put the book down!!!"
1,Sappy and formulaic,"I stuck with this book to the end hoping it would get better, but unfortunately, it never did. The characters are completely wooden with no eccentricities or any interesting qualities, and the plot is nonexistent. It's not a great love story, or even an ordinary, beautiful love story. It's just talking heads who carp about man/woman relationship cliches, and the resolutions are just as cliched.I know there are a lot of glowing testimonials here for this book, but if *you* think a great love story is something like that in The Thorn Birds or Prince of Tides, don't waste your time on this drivel...I hate to be this negative, but I kept hoping Hannibal Lector would come along and ... off some of the characters so the book would be a little more interesting or at least would end sooner."
1,Help Me Return this book!!,Would have made a nice story if it was written so one could read it; the style was SO poor; I had to close it up & say farwell; I knew that if I went any further I'd be stuck in a really bad relationship!
1,predictable and sappy,"Had this book been written by a woman, it would never have been published. Because it is by a man, we are supposed to belive it is ""sensitive"". I found it childish and boring. I read it because I enjoyed ""A Walk to Remember"". I won't be reading any more, this one was awful. I believe it's focus must have been to 14 year old (or younger) girls."
1,don't waste your time...,"this book would not have received a star from me had amazon not required me to fill out the rating, but i guess the 1 star could be given for effort.The plot is totally contrived, predictable, and has all been seen before! just the fact that a single mother who has gone through a lifetime of hardship and being rescued by a firefighter is evidence enough that the book is a total cheese-fest. the writing is so low-level at times that it automatically prompts the reader to roll his or her eyes at such bad writing. taylor's (the firefighter's) best friend saying things like, ""you're like my brother"" is an example of the [bad] storytelling in this book.i hope they don't make this into a movie like they did with his other two books. how sparks makes it onto the ""new york times bestsellers list"" is beyond me."
5,GREAT!,Loved this book. It you like Nicholas Sparks books you'll love this one. I would recommend this to other people for sure.
3,Good read but not great,"I really enjoyed this book, but it was a little bit less than what I expected. I guess I loved The Notebook so much that this one didn't live up to his former glory. However, it is still a good read."
4,"Pretty good, but not author's best","I liked this book, but not as much as True Believer and The Notebook. I haven't read all of Sparks' books, but I'm slowly making my way through them. By the way, about four reviews back someone drops a total spoiler in his/her review, which ruined part of the book for me. Just be forewarned."
4,Painstakingly Beautiful,"This book is very interesting in the beginning, a little boring in the middle with some spouts of excitement, and a big bang at the end! Although it has its drawn-out times, the positives outweigh the negatives. At times you will want to stop reading, but I encourage you to continue because you will be glad you did! Four stars!"
4,"Sentimental, but addicting","I fell prey to the writings of Sparks like so many great readers do. I had heard his name mentioned one too many times and decided to jump on the bandwagon. I must say I was suprisingly pleased. I, myself not a large fan of romance was sucked in by his excellent descriptions and twisting plot. Yes, at times a little more fluff than I like to digest at sitting, but still greatly written. As much as you promise yourself you aren't going to read any further you will find it impossible to put it down. A great story of human truimph. I can see what all the fuss is about."
5,A MUST READ,"This book covers a whole lifetime of emotions, and does it very well, this book is a page turner, once you are in it--you are there for the duration!!!Excellent book--I would recommend it to everyone, and I have!!!"
5,The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks,"This was such a fantastic book of Nicholas Sparks'. In time I will read it many times over. I thought it would be a little odd reading a book about the romance of an older couple, but the characters really came alive on the pages. Taylor and Denise's relationship wasn't ""love at first sight"", but it didn't take the whole book to get into the relationship either.The whole book was incredible, just the right length and amounts of emotion in the whole thing. The characters acted rationally, to me anyway. Such a great book, definitely worth taking time out of your day to read."
5,excellent customer service,I received the item very promptly and it was in the exact condition that I expected. I would definetely purchase from this person again. I am very satisfied.
5,"""The Resuce"" is an awesome story...","This is great love story to read, and I recommend this book to every person out there who enjoys reading romance stories. It tells about a tragic story, a mother and son, who get into an accident at the beginning of the story. Denise, mother of Kyle who has trouble with his speech and doesn't know to much vocabulary, is found by Taylor the volunteer firefighter, after found in the woods after he headed into the woods from the broken window where he sat in his or what I would call booster seat.After he is found, Taylor meets up with Denise and the after time they start falling in love. It seems that the son enjoys Taylor's company and calls him ""daddy"" later in the story and Taylor realizes that he isn't he ""daddy"".In the story, Taylor loses Mitch, a friend, in a fire they fought in a warehouse and Mitch was the only person to not come out alive from the fire.Go out and buy this book."
2,Farfetched,The ending of the book was way out of reality. The obsessed killer did not seem to have enough motive to pull off his attempted act of vengence.
5,The rescue,Great book! Sparks did it again. You will not be able to put this book down you will fall in love
1,if you like Boring this is must read!,"This is one of the most boring books I think I have ever read. It reads just like a Danielle Steele, so if you like her type then you should be happy. The only difference is the reader is spared the details of the lovemaking. But because this is written by a man there are lots of occasions for making love, even when the two aren't getting along otherwise they still end up in bed. Women don't write that way. What a total waste of time. But honestly everything he has written thus far reads this same way in my opinion! Everything here is so stinking predictable. Single mom living in small town meets single hunk and he saves her kid's live and guess what she falls in love,but he has serious emotional baggage from childhood and won't let anyone help."
2,Emotional but the dialogue is too repetitive,"I am a Nicholas Sparks fan, I loved all his earlier books, especially the Notebook and Message in a bottle.. I would recommend The Rescue to those readers who have not read his earlier books because then they will be slightly disappointed in this book... but by all means read Nicholas Sparks books they are inspirational.."
2,Largely predictable,"Although I greatly enjoyed the authors previous works, specifically The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, this book seemed too predictable. Sparks has a wonderful ability to closely detail smalltown life and all it's charm, but the plot-line seemed like familiar territory. Still worth reading for the diehard fans of Sparks. Otherwise I suggest you check out his earlier books."
3,One hit wonder...,"I have been faithful to Nicholas Sparks since I first read THE NOTEBOOK. That story was so touching and insightful, I ran to the bookstore everytime another one of his collections of wise words was released. Unfortunately, I set myself up for disappointment, again. While his thrid book, A WALK TO REMEMBER, did redeam him a little bit after that nightmare, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, it was not nearly the repeat performance I was still expecting. Here again, no different. The story is predictable, sappy, cheesy, and ... predictable. Entertaining? Yes, somewhat. Could I put it down? Yes, definately. Would I recommend it? Not really. Especially if you have expectations about Sparks's stories aleady. Don't run to the bookstore (or the web page) to buy it. If you are curious, i might be willing to commit to its worthiness of paperback. Or, just wait for the movie that is sure to follow."
2,The Rescue,"VERY slow, VERY boring, VERY predictable. It was a painstaking process getting through this book."
3,The Rescue,"This book was ok but the problem that I found was it was to predictable. The characters were interesting though. The story seemed to move to slowly to keep me interested for a great deal of time. I am a Sparks fan and kept coming back to find what I was looking for in the book. It just wasn't keeping my attention, I will however say that I finished it and am looking forward to his next book ."
3,Almost Great!,"I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan since The Notebook, and still think that is his best work. Message in a Bottle was mediocre, and A Walk to Remember was mediocre at best. The same thread runs through all of them, and it gets a bit tiresome. I was very disappoined in the fact that Denise and Taylor resorted to pre-marital sex. Why can't our modern day writers tell a story without this immorality? There are a lot of people, even in real life, who can and do save this for marriage. So why can't the fictional ones do the same?"
2,Book not in good condition,I was expecting the book to be in a better condition as it was stated to be.
2,READ THIS AND YOU'LL NEED TO BE RESCUED!,"Did I miss something? After reading this book, it was hard to believe the same person who wrote other such wonderful romances like A Walk to Remember, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle penned this. I truly had a difficult time trying to finish it..yawn! Dwelling on Kyle's inability to communicate normally, got real tiresome. There were very few moments that were ""exciting"", like towards the end, other than that, this was not one of Nicholas Sparks better works. I'll still continue to read his books - I guess one can't have best sellers all the time."
1,A Disappointment,"I've read enough of Nicholas Sparks to expect a romance but I've also come to expect an ""extra"" layer that redeems by offering a philosophy, point of view or poignancy that is surprising and unique. I did NOT expect to get just another Harlequin caliber saga. Unfortunately, the epilogue was the most interesting and touching part of this book."
3,I Loved It!,"Once again, Nicholas Sparks does his magic! This book captivated my attention from the first page. I recently had the opportunity to hear Sparks speak at a book signing. If case you weren't aware, all of his novels are based on events that have happened in his own life. The characters are people with whom he has had a great deal of interaction. This novel is no exception; Sparks' own son was the model for the character Kyle. The speech difficulties of which were written, are the same difficulties Sparks' son has. I can not say that this book is any better than any of the others, because the three previous books all have messages of their own. The Rescue is written in Sparks' easy-flowing style, and certainly does not lack on message and meaning. I couldn't put it down, and I can not wait for the next novel."
5,"""Rescue ""Your Heart","This book has it all. It's a great story and I highly recommend it. Of all of the novels written by Nicholas Sparks, I think this would have to be my favorite. One can truly connect with the characters in this book. It's also good to know that this novel ends on a happy note, without regrets between the characters."
4,It was a good book,"The book The Rescue by Nicholas Sparkes was a very interesting read. In the beginning Denise which is a single mother rasing a speech impered 4 year old, describes things about her son kyles condtition. After this the book really pulls you in, what happens is Denise gets into a car accident and Kyle gets lost in the strom. And is rescued by a man named Tayler McAden witch is a fireman. As the book goes on Tayler helps Denise and Kyle get through the accident. And so does Taylers mom. Throught this time Denise and Tayler get closer and closer. And find a love they both were looking for but Tayler doesn't what to let her in. This book has a lot of action and love between many of the characters."
4,a hallmark drama and romance,"Perfect story for a Hallmark made for TV movie. Denise and her verbally challenged son Kyle are driving on a dreary North Carolina evening when disaster strikes, and rugged Taylor comes to the rescue. Not only does Taylor become the hero, but the tormented romantic character who drives the story. We know early that something is wrong in his past, and he needs to deal with it in order to prepare himself for the future.Sparks writes in an easy style... slow enough so that if you skip a few pages, you can still pick up the general train of thought without missing anything... sort of like TV soap operas."
5,Genuine and satisfying emotionally,"Nicholas Sparks writes good romance! I felt the characters were believable as was their dialogue. Taylor and Denise's personal pain, their desire, their struggles to live decent balanced lives all seemed pertinent to me, an average U.S. citizen, even though I am not raising a child with strong learning deficiencies, nor am I courageous, melancholy volunteer fireman. The dynamics of their interpersonal relationship was real, it could have been me and my husband talking when first we started dating. And finally, a happy ending makes for high ratings in and of itself! I recommend this for fast and satisfying, light romantic reading."
2,It was was kind-of corny,"I would have liked it better if it did not focus so much on the little boy. They also made Denise pathetic. I was really disapointed. After reading this book I was hesitint to read more by Spark. I did however, just finish A WALK TO REMEMBER by Spark. It was very good and enjoyable."
5,Terrific,This book kept me wanting lots more. I'm so glad everything turned out great. I wish there was continuing book after to learn more about the new family lol.
5,Amazing,I have 3 kids and almost no time for even a shower let alone to read but I couldn't put this book down. I love Nicholas Sparks
4,Good book,I really enjoyed this book. It's right up there with the best by Nicolas Sparks. It has romance and suspense - . I highly recommend it.
3,Mediocre,I love a good romance novel and have read Nicholas Sparks books before. This one was just okay. VERY predictable and very cheesy! I would probably choose another. save your money!
3,It was OK- but No NoteBook,"Ok- so I am new to Nicholas Sparks. I read ""the Notebook"" last week. I thought that was incredible.So I immediately bought this book, The rescue. It was exciting in the beginning- then poof- nothing.The entire rest of the book dragged on until the end - which was nothing short of preditable.I will give him another shot- I am about to read ""message in a bottle"". I figured in order to keep him as a favorite author - I should pick an obvious favorite- although I have never read it and never saw the film.I do love the way he writes - when it comes to feeling. But I don't think he describes people that well. I thought the main charter in the book was a blonde until halfway thru the book when he says she has jet black hair.Oh well. I will try another and then judge."
4,Single mom rescues firefighter,"Denise Holton is a young woman beset with problems. She is the single mom of a a 4-year-old boy with severe language disabilities who tries to make ends meet with a waitressing job. One night on a storm-slickened road she has an accident and her young son Kyle disappears. A volunteer fireman named Taylor McAden heads a group of rescuers who first find Denise and then look for Kyle. The two form an attraction which is complicated by some emotional baggage which keeps Taylor from being willing to commit himself to anyone. Nicholas Sparks' books are pretty predictable, but he creates well-developed characters whose emotional sides are revealed in a way that makes the journey of reading them well worthwhile."
2,A little disappointed,I love Nicholas Sparks! The Notebook and Message in a Bottle were GREAT but Sparks' last two books have left me disappointed. The Rescue is a good book but not the excellent read I expected.
5,Amazing,I loved it!! It . Only took took two days to read I could not put it down!! Definitely a great read. Love Nicholas sparks and can not wait to read another novel of his!! :)
3,The Resuce,"This is a typical Nicholas Sparks story, but had me engrossed from start to finish. The storyline was predictable, but getting there was a great read."
4,The Rescue,"I received the book quickly and in good condition. The book "" The Rescue"" was very suspensful. I would recommend the book to anyone who like a nice story with some mystery."
5,THE RESCUE,"THE RESCUE by Nicholas Sparks was a great book. It's a great story that definetly captures one's heart. If you haven't read it, I would definetly recomment reading it! Sit down, relax and read away. Also, if you haven't read any of his other books, they are all great. AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR a walk to remember TO COME OUT AS A MOVIE!!!"
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"This book was an emotional roller coaster. Read it when you are alone because you won't be able to stop crying during some parts! The story's up and downs, and feel-good finale really touched my heart. Now I want to find more by Nicholas Sparks....."
2,unfullfilled promise,"I have enjoyed the author's previous work so I anticipated that this story""Rescue"" would be a ""good read"". I tried to become involved with the characters and to care about what happened to them but about half way through...it was a struggle to finish. Nicholas Sparks is still a good story teller but this story missed the mark."
1,RESCUE ME FROM PREDICTABILITY,"I read Nicholas Sparks' ""The Notebook,"" and thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. I even bought a few copies for my friends. I also loved ""Message In A Bottle."" I considered myself a Nicholas Sparks fan, but I'm not so sure now after reading ""THE RESCUE."" It reads like a first novel and I am so disappointed. I was tempted several times to put it back on my book shelf, but miraculously I made it all the way through the book. I do agree with one other reviewer that the subject matter was deeper than it seemed. However, my biggest complaint about the book is the predictability factor. It was so darn predictable. I compare this book with ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" i.e., a lot of fluff over nothing. Mr. Sparks...I hope you do better in your next novel, or you're going to lose me as a fan. Most sincerely, Susan from Dayton, Nevada."
1,Rolling my eyes...,"This is the most cliched story you can ever imagine. At one point, when Taylor took Denise on the date and then when they got back had strawberries and champagne and candlelight, I literally rolled my eyes.Because I am not a person who can stop reading a book, I read to the end but was I ever glad when it was over. It was lame. I'm glad I only paid a dollar for it on my Kindle. It was on sale at the time I bought it."
4,The Rescue,"As always, this was an awesome book by Nicholas Sparks. It was about a man, Taylor, who is a voluntary firefighter who rescues Denise Holton and your young son, Kyle. Both of them go where nobody has gone before, into Taylor's heart. Taylor harbors responsibility for his father's death and does not allow people to get too close. Will Denise be able to penetrate that wall that Taylor has built around his heart? Time will tell."
2,Too Forgiving,"A disturbing book about a woman, Denise, who falls in love with a man, Taylor, who has serious psychological issues from a dramatic childhood event. These issues reveal themselves in risky behavior, withdrawal and even violence. Though Denise pulls away after seeing these behaviors, she very quickly takes Taylor back, ultimately marrying and starting a family with him, based on his promise to work on these issues. Though it appears Taylor is on the road to recovery, it feels like Denise is rushing into a relationship that could blow up at any moment. The message sent is very unhealthy."
2,Oh Please,"Freakin ridiculous. Love is never THAT easy. At least A Walk to Remember and The Notebook had some major conflict in them. True Believer was good too, but this one was a little too predictable."
3,A little slow...,"After a while you get tired of the same saga, and you want some thing to happen! Typical book of Sparks where the man is scared and the woman is desperate."
5,Great Story!!!!,I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them.
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me. It was a very very slow start. I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot. I had even considered quitting reading it at times. It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading. What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were. I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like ""The Notebook"" or ""The Wedding"" if you want a good romantic read."
4,Very well written,Wonderful and easy reading. I couldn't put it down. Kept my attention...Looking forward to more of Nicholas sparks books.
4,A story that pulls you in......,"This is a Great book, my heart wept for Denise as she tried desperetly to help her child Kyle talk and understand language. Then Taylor entered her life and things changed over night. I cheered for their first kiss and yelled when he left her behind to chase another fire. An author with feelings that women truely can relate to."
3,Romantic in all aspects of the word,"Don't bother to read this book if you are not a romance lover. This book, like Sparks' previous books is a true romance. It is hard to believe that these books are written by a man. Usually the romance genre is tackled only by women authors. This is a romance book with a different twist - Denise is a single mom with a small child with a disability to raise. In other aspects she is a completely normal woman with no excess baggage. In this case it's the man that is carrying the excess baggage and we find out that this is what has stopped him from really living (of course until Denise comes along). A lot of the book is predictable. After the first four chapters, I knew who was going to get killed in the story. I also knew that this death was necessary to snap Taylor out of his self-defeating lifestyle. Not to give anything away, I won't say who did die. You'll have to read this book to find out. Go ahead. Read it if you like romances. You'll love this book."
5,A great book for anyone who attends Weight Watchers!,"Reading the history of Jean Nidetch and the way WW began is a real treat! It is an inspiring story for anyone, whether fat or slim, but it is especially interesting for today's members of Weight Watchers to read how it all began and to compare the food requirements of the past to the present. No longer is liver required once a week as a strict ""legal"" food. But it was never the diet per se; it was Jean's enthusiasm that convinced a small group of fat women to adhere to it. Jean insists ""fat"" is the right word. Her six friends lost weight and the idea worked! Today Weight Watchers has become an international organization."
2,Can't recommend.,"It worked well for a little while, but the non-stick quickly started to come off, and left this pan useless."
5,Wrong CD Reviewed,"Thank you to the reader from San Diego who noticed the error that another reviewer and I each made. The CD I reviewed wasasn=B0000060IW. I cannot comment on THIS cd as I have not heard it, but the contents look good!"
1,What is this?,"This may actually be a quite good collection which was originally collected for the Smithsonian's American Jazz Heritage in 1998 on a Sony Special Product label. Unfortunately, without more information about tracks or artists, it is impossible to know for sure. IF it is the same collection, you should buy it in a hearbeat--it's a complex, comprehensive, and frankly stunning survey of the American jazz vocalist from 1919 to the mid '90's. The enclosed booklet with incredible detail on the background and musicians of each track is an education all by itself.If not...well, ""Armstrong, et al"" is not a lot of information to base your purchase on (great as Satchmo is)."
5,excellent,"My son who is almost three absolutely loves this toy. He usually goes from toy to toy. But, he has played with it continuously since we purchased it. I give this toy an A+!"
5,Just what I needed,"This scale was exactly as advertised. Very easy to read, and the increments are clearly marked. Totally accurate for the job, short order cook in a snack/munchie operation. A snap to calibrate, and the large tub is excellent for holding the products."
1,Thanks for the heads up ! Very misleading advertising,"Thank you for the information - I almost made the same mistake. I saw other Steps that were $80+, and then saw this one advertised here for much less so I almost jumped right on it. Your review was really helpful and prevented me from doing the same thing you did ! I totally agree, they should never post a photo for a complete step if all they are selling are the blocks. They are going to have a LOT of unhappy customers."
4,Nice outfit for the money,I received this today in the mail. I like it. I am a size 6 and the fit was good. The back of the packaging states a small fits from 90 to 160 pounds but I weigh 133 pounds and the skirt fits me perfect so I would suggest that if you are a size 8 or more you order the next size up. Not the most expensive outfit out there but it works.
3,solid,"Its a solid rock album thats pretty fun. i gave it 3 stars because you cant really capture these guys energy on a record, you need to see them live to know what harmony riley is all about. It kinda sounded alot like a dave matthews album to me but i dont know>"
4,"too soon old, too late smart","The firefox series continues to amaze me with it's simplicity and beautiful documentation of the Mountain life style. The other lesson is that we all need to pass forward what we have learned and loved to the next generation and the next and the next ... Picking up the earlier FF books is well worthwhile, every one a jewel."
5,Foxfire 6,All I can say is that all the Foxfire Books are wonderful for getting back to basics in life. Which I feel is going to come around sooner rather then later. Its nice to know how to do some of the old fashion things it will take to survive.
5,Fascinating and Challenging,"It is a pleasure to read a food book with such vast information. With its tightly written entries, I can absorb knowledge while relaxing. I have worked with freshly prepared food and fresh produce all my life. My father is an avid gardener.With my past 30 years of experience in restaurant work and as a produce specialist, it is uplifting to keep learning from this book. The ABC'S OF FOOD has fascinated and challenged me to broaden my horizons. I highly recommend THE ABC'S OF FOOD to any age group. --Joan Harness, Wal-Mart Superstore Produce Specialist"
5,excellant!,after seeing Joe live twice I'm convenced he is one of the best.this cd will be one of your favorites to as it is mine.Joe is a master player who puts out great music.If you like classicstandards with a delightful twist you won't be disapointed.Thereare no bad songs. a winner.
5,A gem that's well worth owning,"The comments by other reviewers are on-target. This is an outstanding CD in every way. It comes across as heartfelt and surprisingly moving. These guys should be incredibly proud of what they accomplished with this, because it holds up exceptionally well."
5,It Changed my Life,"It's hard to believe this guy doesn't have his own TV special. Great voice and tone, with emotion flowing along with the melody. My Christmas gift problems are solved."
1,Freezes up Window XP until reboot with Java applications.,"When a Java program tries to access the network, the card causes Windows XP to repeatedly freeze up for 20-60 seconds then let you click for about 1-2 seconds. Logging off doesn't help. Shutting down processes doesn't help. The only thing that solves the problem is to restart the entire computer.Do *not* buy this card. You will just end up buying a nice 3Com later."
4,Works as it should....,Installed in a few minutes. Windows XP recognized it automatically. I didn't have to fool with installing any drivers.It just worked... Great product.
4,Great card (so far) - supports XP Pro,"I bought this card for ... after my previous RealTek card ... out...The package had a 'Supports Windows XP' sticker on it, but I was still happily surprised to see XP find it and welcome it without so much as asking for either the included driver disk or the XP disk. I'm on a dual-boot system with 98, and of course 98 was fine with it too - although I did have to go through the 'search for the best driver' rigmarole and use both the driver diskette and the 98 disk to get it going.Anyway, the card's looking good so far. I'd give it 5 stars, but I've only had it a day and, of course, Things Could Come Up."
2,Compatibility issues,"Good price, otherwise, the card was bad...I bought it and used it with Iwill Xp-333 Mobo, and it wouldnt allow the computer to boot up when it was installed. Then I tried it in Dell 8200 and it worked, but didn't show the computer on the other workstations.I would go with something like Linksys, and integrated is even better"
3,Ehh...,"I got this card for free via Verizon Online DSL because of a switch-up and it has its ups and downs. For one thing, it was VERY easy to install, because it was my first time going in the computer. But the manual and the actual computer read out isnt the same, making it somewhat confusing. I'm running a 5-year-old Windows 98 SE that survived from a crash in 2003. I guess that my computer acted up when installing because during the crash, two files, NDIS.VXD and NTKERN.VXD got corrupted and i was relying those files to load the driver! Now I have to go to my computer-know-it-all cousin who has a Windows 98 SE disk. But, let me tell you to NEVER buy a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Computer! They told me I never even had a warranty after signing for a 5-year-plan and paying $499.99!!! They basically messed me over $500!!!"
1,Don't use this card with Windows XP,I've had constant problems with this card since I upgraded to XP. I've given up on trying to make this work and I'm going to go buy another card.
2,Chipset Incompatibilities,"The card seems to be well-made, and the included documentation was sufficient for installing the card and doing minimal troubleshooting. As advertised, the card did fit in a PCI slot. However, when installed, my computer wouldn't boot. In fact, it wouldn't successfully complete the POST. I dutifully downloaded chipset updates for my motherboard and installed it in the slot formerly occupied by my sound card but still it wouldn't boot. There seems to be an issue with either the AMD 761 or VIA 686 chipsets on my motherboard. Others seem to have good luck with it, but I recommend avoiding it if you have an Athlon system with the AMD/VIA chipsets. I ended up returning this card and getting the D-Link DFE-530TX+, which works flawlessly."
5,Linux hacks required,"5 stars, but a word of warning. The drivers supplied with these cards are known not to work with Linux. You will need to compile & install the Linux drivers manually.To do this you will need the ""natsemi"" drivers - NOT ""tulip"" as per other/older netgear cards.Apart from that, no problems running under WinMe/Win98 or Win2k."
2,Flaky,"Overall I like Netgear...but I think this card may have been rushed to market. It worked fine at first, but overtime developed issues to the point where, the card will not establish a connection with the Gigabit Switch. I have some 100 MB switch ports still available, and the card works ok in them, but when I connect it to the Gigabit Switch, it will not establish a connection. We have upgraded drivers, reseated the cards, tried different ports, even rebuilt the computer and it still will not maintain a connection unless we have it connected to the 100 MB switch...which kind of defeats the purpose. Hopefully Netgear's newer Gigabit cards are more stable."
1,"Awful instuctions, shipped with a faulty driver","Instructions for installing this card were a nightmare to follow. I bought this card to help my mom out and even I could not understand the instructions which were poorly translated from Chinese. The proper driver was not included on the disk and it was extremely difficult to find a Windows 7 driver. Netgear does not seem to fully support this hardware with windows drivers. I would have sent it back, but the price was so cheap, it just was not worth the hassle. I did learn to never buy a cheap NIC card like this in the future."
2,FA311 V2,"Plug and Pray, not Plug and Play...I had to get a new NIC on an urgent basis as the onboard NIC in our XP desktop failed due to a lightning strike, so I did not get the chance to read reviews first, otherwise I would have stayed away from this product. I do RTFM when I get something like this and it said to install it by inserting the card in a PCI slot and then powerup and install the driver. Makes sense, right? In the package, the wrapper with the card in it had a big label that said to install the SW first. WTH? Which should you do first? They could at least slap a sticker on the box! I did finally get it to work by following the manual instructions and re-booting twice. It appears to work as well as can be expected."
1,Netgear Warranty Sux,"After 6 month operating the FA312 card, the card suddenly burned and the system won't power-up until i removed it. After calling the technical support, the response that i get is that Netgear's warranty doesn't cover a card that gets burned. Even though I and an UPS and tried to install it on different system and different motherboard, the tech support kept asking for more, like ""go to your neighbor and install it in his system"". Like who would let you install a card that can mess-up their system.My best advice is to STAY AWAY FROM NETGEAR THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEIR ""WARRANTY"" that doesn't cover anything."
3,Not bad for the price,I had some trouble getting it to work on my Win 93 SE Amd Athlon 1Ghz computer. But after about 3 days of working with my DSL tech support we finally got her up and running.I have not had a problem with it since.
3,Works very well if you get past install,"I have a love hate relationship with Netgear. Their products are all very high quality.. but they always seem to fumble the ball on the small things that make a big difference.In this case, the driver software install isn't very robust. To install on the computers running Win98SE was much more of a headache then I have ever had with other LAN cards and involved a number of little ploys to trick the computer into recognizing the card and associating the right driver to it.Sure Microsoft Plug and Play is a large part of the problem but Netgear should be putting together better documentation and software fixes to make it go easier.Bottom line: Worked like a charm when I got it in but I don't look forward to reinstalling it."
2,warning!,"This card will cause a major problem if you have a Athlon DDR motherboard with the amd761 chipset. You will not be able to reboot!The 310tx does not have this problem. The 311 has an updated controller, called a ""soft"" controller, that uses cpu power, much like a ""win""modem vs. older, controller-based modems. In general, avoid these..."
1,Save yourself the trouble...,"If you like to gamble on mediocre hardware, then by all means by this card, maybe you'll get lucky and it won't lockup your machine or freeze your system for several minutes randomly. Do yourself a favor and search google for ""netgear FA311"" and look at all the problems. This card has a major hardware flaw that can't be solved by drivers or firmware updates. I've tried using 3 different drivers, two from netgear, and one from the chip manufacturer themselves, all 3 resulted in random freezes within 5 minutes of booting into Windows. If Netgear is aware of the problem they're yet another company that doesn't support their customers because they don't admit it and they don't offer a fix. Probably because it's a hardware issue that can't be fixed with software. I hear these problems are solved on the FA312 because it uses a totally different chipset, so if you absolutely have to buy a card from Netgear, get that instead of the FA311."
1,bummer,"Installing an ethernet card should be simple, right? Put the card in the slot, install the driver - bingo.Not if the company has programmed it with an incorrect PCI ID. It will be unusable.""A small percentage of the FA311 with serial numbers starting with the characters below is affected. FA35A09, FA35A0A, FA35A0B, FA35A0C, FA35A11, FA35A12, FA35B11, FA35B12, FA35B13, FA35B14.""Lucky purchasers of that small percentage may experience frustration, rage, and a tendency to avoid Netgear products in the future.Eventually (using a borrowed laptop and a dial-up internet provider since we couldn't use our DSL without a functioning ethernet card) we were able to find a fix on Netgear's website.Ah, so they knowingly sent us a defective product, it's not like it was a one-time fluke or anything, there's a bunch of people just like us, part of an unlucky ""small percentage.""Thanks, Netgear! Produts that work are so boring. Thanks for mixing it up with some spicy defective ones that don't."
1,An incomplete course,"I don't know where to begin. Unorganised layout; the most difficult to follow beginners book I've ever read; full of phonetical blunders and inadecuate/inaccurate pronunciation guides; a mixture of patronising explanations and way-over-my-head technical vocabulary (without explanation, incidentally); too few illustrations along the way, and not enough exercises to practice what you've barely learned. I'm now looking for a Hebrew book in the style of Wenham's 'elements of new testament greek'. Look for an old style grammar/instruction book of the language, don't go for new-look books."
2,Good luck teaching yourself with this book.,"I would not recommend this book for anyone without any prior knowledge of the Hebrew alef-bet. It tries to make many distinctions between sounds that ultimately have the same pronunciation. It is very confusing and long-winded. For an apt book on learning to read Hebrew, try: ""Learn Hebrew Today: Alef-Bet for Adults"" by Paul Michael Yedwab and Howard I. Bogot."
1,Start Somewhere Else,"I cannot recommend this as a ""teach yourself"" text. You would be better off starting ANYwhere else."
1,Difficult and antiquated,"This is the first book on Biblical Hebrew I ever got. It was first published in 1955, and it followed a rather antiquated model of language instruction. It is dull and difficult to follow, in spite of being ostensibly designed for self study. I cannot recommend it. Many more helpful books have been published in the decades since Harrison's book came out. My personal favorite isA Modern Introduction to Biblical Hebrew, but you can find plenty of others out there."
5,Biblical Hebrew,Another book well worth the price if you want to learn Biblical Hebrew. Small and easy to carry around with you too.
1,Confuse Yourself,"I have studied Hebrew on and off since 1984. This book would be extremely difficult to understand for a beginner. I would not recommend this book. There is nothing wrong with buying a children's primer to start your study in Hebrew and gradually move on to more advanced teaching. This book is not the one to ""Teach Yourself Biblical Hebrew""."
2,"Painfully, unbelievably bad !!","I read the reviews here on Amazon, and thought to myself ""This book can't be that bad, can it?"". So I borrowed it from the library... and then found out for myself that I was so wrong! Yes, it really IS that bad. Consider yourself warned :O) Now, for someone who already has some background in Hebrew, this might be a good reference work to have on their shelf. But if youre a beginner, do yourself a favor and skip this one. Instead, I'd recommend ""Learn Biblical Hebrew"", by John H Dobson."
4,mf,"gives a good picture of the products and models massey ferguson produced over the years. I would liked to have seen more info on the models, such as years of production and serial numbers for each year. All in all very informative."
2,Nice but not durable,"I LOVE this ice bucket. It's beautiful, does what it ought to do... but after a few uses, the handle has popped out, so now it becomes dangerous to use when transporting! It's a shame that such a flaw exists on a nice quality ice bucket. I still use it, but have to make sure no one grabs it by the handle lest all of the ice spill on the floor!"
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this for my 3-yr old son, and realized it was a mistake as soon as we opened the package - it's a life size fabric chart with decent quality, but it requires you to measure from the floor to the feet of the chart ""boy"" to be able to use it. It's not as easy as you think when you try to hang this on the wall with precision, for the fabric is wrinkled up from being folded for a long time. It's really a stupid idea that you have to measure it before you can use it to measure your child. Besides, it's quite scary everytime you turn to its direction and mistake it for a big person standing against the wall. To protect us from heartattacks, it got wrapped up and put away in the storage forever."
5,The man is a god!,"Look no further. This is simply THE book to get, to keep, to cherish, to fondle lovingly, when you want to learn -- or to master if you've already made headway learning -- Celtic guitar. Accept no substitutes.This handsome volume covers everything you'd ever need to know to begin, to improve, or to master, the subject by the world's foremost Celtic guitar instructor (AND the most eminent Celtic guitar performer this side of the Atlantic).Clarity and a deceptive simplicity leap from each page. The rich, yet readily understandable, prose crackles with an eloquence and engaging wit unmatched in the field of instrumental instruction texts, yet never for an instant distracts us from the important work of absorbing more about Celtic guitar than we would've ever imagined possible.Forget all the other manuals and just get the very best. This landmark text is pure gold."
3,"Hardly a ""Method""","This book isn't really a ""method"" as it claims. It has a few techniques and briefly discusses other aspects. It is more of a transcription of the author's cd. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great as are the transcriptions. Just not what I thought it was going to be."
1,Only worked once,"This watch could have been made in better quality. The design could have been better thought also. The worst of all, it worked only once then something died in there that it stopped functioning. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Not for everyone,"I purchased this product as an alternative to my chest belt monitor and I'm sure it works well for others, but for me, the fit was rather uncomfortable. The first problem I had was with the actual monitor flopping around too much when I moved, the velcro would slip off occasionally. Another problem I had was with the the sensor that went over my index finger. I followed the instructions and made sure it was tight enough by looking a an imprint on the velcro that is supposed to turn from an oval to a circle when tight enough. The actual sensor was metal and it felt very uncomfortable. I wore it for a while hoping I would get used to it, but it just didn't feel right. To top things off, the monitor would randomly turn off. Maybe my hands are too big, I don't know. It just isn't for me. I also thought the quality of the device is poor for the selling price."
1,Not worth it,The concept was great -- a heart rate monitor without a chest strap. Kids could wear it on their hands and go shirtless without any issues. The only problem was that all 10 I purchased did not even last one year of use before breaking down! Other reviews alerted me to this issue and I ignored them. Please don't be as stupid as I was. Do not buy this product unless you have money to throw away and only need it to work for about 3 months.
5,MAGNADELISHAFUNKALOVELY!,"Buy this disc because your soul needs it. See them live because the disc has poor production values and sounds like it was recorded in a basement.They champion traditional ska and reggae, while infusing elements of Motown-esque soul, R&B, punk, rockabilly, and rock.Fun, fun, fun, and the lyrics on ""Dr. Moriarty"" are wondrous."
2,Not new,Only a live show can really show the true talents of this Washington D.C. band that should win the superlative for best freshman band. The CD is at times unimaginative and lacks the impetus of what is brought to the stage. This senescent recording shows that releasing a CD so far out of date can only hurt.
4,Cool Album!,"I would have never checked this album out if it weren't for Martin Popoff's book on Heavy Metal. This album is an unknown gem. The production is great and most of the songs have cool grooves and good vocals. I dig Backdoor Romeo (great lyrics), You and Your Friend (should have been huge), Bad Girls and Angels (cool vocals), Fire It Up (great chorus), and Bone Down. Despite the fact that Jeff Tyson was a student of Joe Satriani he does not overplay. Instead he focuses on the songs and plays some great rhythm guitar. Whether you like rock, funk, or dance music this is one of those albums that I think many people can get into. Four and a half stars! Check it out if you can find it!"
4,T-Ride,"I received my order in a very fast and timely manner.Had expected to wait anywhere from 5 to 7 days but received my order after 3 days.Product came in excellent condition,no scratches or marks.Plays very well and enjoy it over and over again.Thank you and I will continue to do business with Amazon and the shipper in the future as always."
3,Stiff and not a spoon,"I expected this spatula to be a ""spoon spatula"" but it is just flat and a bit stiff. Great handle."
1,Dries up fast after opening,"This glue performs as advertised as a ""professional strength"" product. It produces a very strong adhesive bond between the gaps. It does bubble while drying but is tolerable since its performance is good. One critical issue that lowered my enthusiasm to a 1-star is the glue dries up quickly after opening. I've tried covering it with a plastic shield between the cap and the bottle but didn't help. The whole bottle completely dried up within 3 weeks after the 1st open."
2,The Big One has an off night,Matti Salminen seems bored with his role. His Hagen is much better under James Levine.
3,A good space-adventure,"A derelict ship proves to be the carrier of an off-world plague, threatening to put an end to the Thornen way of life, if allowed to proliferate. The commando team has to find out where the ship has come from, and do everything possible to anihilate the threat. But Sogan has already encountered the organisms and knows the only salvation lies in destroying all spores - and all possible carriers. So the race against enemies turns into a battle with time, in wich the former Admiral has to play on the lives of all his team, including himself.The fourth in the Star Commandos series, recommended for '80s and '90s sci-fi fans."
5,kitchenaid 17-inch slider,"I bought this on sale at Amazon for $6.99, and have used this pan twice so far (to bake cookies), and the nonstick surface works great. No need to grease the pan; cookies (even the burnt caramelly bitty pieces) come right off. They also seem to brown the cookies more evenly (comparing the lighter tops to the darker sides and bottoms of the cookies) than do my other baking sheets. Apart from the manufacturer's warnings not to cut on top of the surface with metal knives, etc. (printed on the packaging but not included in Amazon's description--apparently metal spatulas are ok but knives are not), the only other caveat I have would be to make sure that it fits into your oven--the 17"" width is suitable for most but not all ovens."
1,Ok... for the first use,"This product is awful. I could bake cookies on it the first time I used it and never again, even when I was only using them for cookies. I had to adjust the temp to 50 degrees below what the recipe called for per the cookie sheet instructions. Now when I try to use them the cookies are burnt on the bottom and mush on the top. They still work for fish sticks (only if I adjust the temp to 75 degrees lower) and I guess that's the only reason I keep them around. I guess I should tell you I've had them for going on 5 years now, the kids do love their fish sticks."
1,Sad Reality,"George Pollock was an ambitious man who wrote his memoirs and died before they were published. He was a tenacious, arrogant and self serving businessman. He wasn't factual in his statement's about the mountain people. He called them squatter's when in fact most of them held deeds to their property. Deeds dating back to the early 1800's long before Pollock was born. However, it was to his advantage to portray them as squatters, illiterate, immoral and backward to stir up sentiment against them and thereby get complete approval to establish the Park and displace all these hundreds of people who had lived in the area since the early 1800's. He is solely responsible for the removals and disruptions of over 400 families. How do I know this? I am a descendent of one of those families - one of those so called ""squatters""......Diane Nicholson Smith"
5,My favorite book!,I think that The River of No Return is my favorite book because it has a lot of choises. I like deciding which way to go. This book has a lot of adventure in it. I have read the book 4 times and each time it has a different outcome.
1,Puts the kids to sleep.,"I bought this book based on the other reviews. I was very disappointed. My kids can't stand the story, and find the main characters unrealistic,and dull. They fell asleep right away. I tried to read it to them the following evening and was met with intense protest from my youngest child. The ""River of No Return"" will its self soon be returned! Who writes those reveiws?"
5,Informative and Inspirational,"I am new to the idea of raw foods, and this is the first book that I have read on the subject. It was perfect for me because it has alot of information that gave me a better understanding, and also many reasons to back the information up. This book is written with a very positive and energetic attitude which made it easy for me to read, and also made me willing to try its ideas. There are journal activities that helped me to personalize the ideas and fit them into my own life. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for inspiration along with new and clear knowlede."
3,Good Info but crosses that invisible line,"When you first start reading the book you are amazed at the info being provided and you begin to feel like you have just had a dark cloud lifted from around you but..... It's a big but, you start to read lines that are a bit radical that don't seem like it's something that can really work. All of us can't retreat to the woods and eat watermelon (with the seeds mind you) all day. Stuff like that was annoying. I do however agree with a lot of the food principles especially since a lot of it has been substantiated by other authors. I do find this book is good as a reference from time to time and I try not to think to hard about the patronizing attitude of the author."
4,Raw foods only,"This is a very good raw food book. It's a book for the person who is determined to make raw food their diet choice. It's full of raw food information, which makes it a great reference book. If you're a busy person, maybe a more recreational reader, and need/want something concise and easy to read, this might not be the book for you (yet). If your goal is to be as informed as you can be about what you're eating and what it does to your body, energy, well being, and just about everything else, then this is a book you must buy, read, and keep on your bookshelf as a reference."
3,"Dispels the ""must have dehydrator and juicer"" myth....","I like this book because it has a lot of good arguments for getting back to nature. I see far too many raw food books that are all about dehydrating food to make it look ""cooked"", thus turning off potential raw-foodists who think that they need to plan their meals several days in advance, and very few that are about just eating the foods. This book is just about eating natural food, IN it's natural state, and talks about why it's a good idea.I didn't care much for the writing style, or the several pages of poetry, but that's just me. I am hard to please when it comes to poetry."
3,Tractors is so DUMB!,"This thing is very funny for those who love the tractor tipping part of the movie and the video game. Did you know they even have an udder?!? How much more detail can you have than that?! It will not tip on a soft surface, like a carpet or couch, but works great on hard surfaces. When the kids got bored with tipping it, they played with it like they do any of their other cars. They do lose interest in it, but it's still an off and on favorite. I wish they would make a version of Frank!!"
3,Tip and Toot Tractor,"I must admit I bought this because my son likes cars, and I didn't see the movie prior to buying it. I also bought it because it was clearance and really cheap.This thing holds up to almost everything my son did with it. It was a little hard to figure out sometimes and pushing the muffler down sometimes didn't make it tip and noise.My son liked it for alittle while, then he moved on. To make it easy, kinda a boring toy, but cute indeed."
4,Cars Tip & Toot Tractor,This was a last minute Christmas present for my then 3 year old son. Amazon was the only place I could find this toy last year one week before Christmas and I recieved it a couple days BEFORE Christmas even with my last minute ordering! My son and daughter really liked it when they first got it but the newness wore off and it is now in the toybox (but is still in one piece after all of the abuse a 2 year old and a 3 year old can dish out!) I would recommend this to anyone who has kids who love Disney Cars. It is alot of fun to watch this toy.
5,Tractor tippin's fun,"We got this for my son's 4th birthday. He's a real fan of the Cars movie, and especially of the ""tractor tippin'"" scene. When he saw this, his eye's lit up. He could've gotten only this for his birthday, and he would've been completely content.It doesn't look extremely durable (I'm waiting for the ears - rearview mirrors - to come off), but so far after about 2-3 straight hours of play, it's going strong."
4,Good Product!,"Its kinda sorta difficult for a 4 yr old to use. Tips over and toots just fine, but the sounds that it produces are low or not as defined and or not as clear as they should be with being muffled as to hardly making out the moooo part as well. Yes, we checked/replaced batteries, but other than that its a good product, thank you."
4,It's a cute toy...,"I got this toy for my 3-year-old this past Christmas and he LOVES irritating his 11-year-old sister with it! It doesn't rank up there with the Mack Truck Bachelor Pad Playset (in my son's eyes), but it is cute!"
4,Great pictures !!.................However...,"This book is very well done, as are the other Motorbook ones on the subject of Police cars.. But if you are a real buff, the material will look very light...Basic explanations made for the profane or the 10-year old asking ""where does the siren sound come from Dad ?"""
2,Not Great...,"I believe in staying in tune with the changing seasons, and thought this CD would be a fun way to help teach my son about the seasons. The Spring and Summer songs are cute, and we enjoy dancing to those. Other than the (stupid) Halloween one, there is only one Autumn song, which is really slow and boring. I wasn't very impressed with the holiday songs... Would've appreciated a song about the Solstice, since that actually is the ""reason for the season"". Apparently there is a song about snowflakes, but I don't recall hearing this, so it must not have impressed me. Then there are several completely non-seasonal songs at the end, and those songs aren't much fun either. I was pretty disappointed. I had seen The Learning Station live, and the songs they sang then were a lot more fun and creative. The only reason I haven't given this CD to the local thrift store is because of the Spring and Summer songs."
5,cd's,Very pleased on the handling of my order and protection that was taken to ship it and the accuracy on the order its self and shipped on a timely matter.
2,Recording Quality,Some home engineer had fun with his new equipment no doubt. Still its good that someone made the attempt to play such excellent music. How could you get such a simple microphone setup so wrong?
3,Nice to look at but..,"I thought this book would be more of a ""how to"", but it is definitely not. It does have some recipes in the back, but on the whole it's a ""lookin at"" book, and it wasn't what I expected. It is gorgeous, but not very useful."
2,"Gone, And Also Forgotten",This is early nineties pop music so formulaic it could be considered ritualistic.
1,I was Surprised,"The contents of this book was very sparse. The amount of content amounts to roughly a 40 page academic paper. the authors make sure to add plenty of space around the text in order to add page volume. You pay $200 dollars for what amounts to a working paper. The book is spiral bound, has no formula's and absolutely no rigorous results. There is nothing in this book worth spending more than $10-$20 for. Most of what is written in this book can be found by doing a search on Google."
4,Good read for direct marketers.,This book packs a lot of information. It's far more than an any academic paper because it's based on real world situations and gets into the nitty-gritty of the numbers. Lots of detail. Great charts and graphs. It'sa good read for direct marketers.Direct Marketing Quantified: The Knowledge is in the Numbers
3,Cleansliness,"Samuel Jackson portrays a beleivble ex cop, in a pretty beleivable scenario.He takes care of the 'dirty' jobs. Consisting of cleaning up after deaths, and crime scenes revolving around murders. Living in a corrupt world, and trying to raise the right virtues for a daughter, things are about to get frisky.His job leads to a conspiracy possibly amongst his old work force. However something just isn't adding up and he's willing to do anything to tie it all together. The movie is a bit boring, kinda rough around the edges, but has a good enough story to keep you interested the whole way through. If this movie isn't a book I feel the need to announce it'd make for a much better book than film. Genuinly haunted from his past, the future brings many painful flash backs. Pressured and not sure where to turn, the movie easily picks up (but not cohesively).Good rental"
1,Completely Expected Twists and Turns,"Is it bad when great actors work in crappy movies? Does it hurt their careers? In this case, I hope not because what ruined this movie was not the acting. The screenplay and directing however...ouch!So many opportunities for intrigue and tension were circumvented for no apparent reason. All the problems faced by the characters were solved way too easily. What a bore! What's the point?"
3,Entertaining,"This movie is not the best movie I have ever seen. But, it was entertaining. The acting was pretty good. The premise of the story was interesting. Worth watching."
4,Review of the Cleaner,One of the more interesting movies I've seen lately. It is cross between a suspense/drama movie & thriller movie with a solid storyline and nice twist and turns throughout this movie. One is left guessing until the very end of this movie who the killer's identity is in this movie... I highly recommend watching this movie.
2,Promising Cast But Confused Story,"Though you could not have asked for a better cast, this movie just did not gell and by the end I really did not believe that I got or accepted the plot. I mean, how bad must a movie be to have Ed Harris, Samuel L. Jackson and all the others and still suck? The premise is promising but the implementation was not and this movie just failed to inspire."
2,plot heavy,"Too much plot, not enough story.When will crime writers realize that you do not need a bunch of bogus twists and turns for a crime drama to work?What the Ed Harris character does at the end is absolutely not believable.They missed a great opportunity here to do a simpler (but more interesting) story about the Samuel Jackson character doing his job (as crime scene cleaner--which is quite a ""gig"" in and of itself) while trying to raise his teen daughter, instead of all the corrupt cop crap.Who gives a damn about corrupt cops anymore? I mean the theme is a cliche; it's old. Exactly why Scorsese's The Departed didn't work either."
1,Worse than the worst CSI episode,"""Cleaner"" scales new heights of rote cop-movie predictability. Everything you think is going to happen happens about ten minutes later. The A-list cast is wasted. This movie is so bad it even makes Luis Guzman look boring. Stay far, far away."
5,Best smelling aftershave balm!,"I bought a few aftershave balms and this is the best one in terms of smell. Smells really good, now I have to order a bottle of the cologne to go with it."
4,Great hat for the price,"I was looking for something similar to one of my old hats that has seen better days, and this was as close as I could find. It's not exactly what I was looking for, but it turned out to be a sturdy, well fitting hat, at a price that can't be beat. I will probably order a few more just for the heck of it, at this price I can afford to have a couple backups."
5,Top-Notch Straight-Up Metal,"This CD should have been a MONSTER seller and all over the airwaves when it was first released. John Corabi is an awesome frontman and went on to further prove himself in Motley Crue and Union. And the band here scorches and smokes behind him. There's truly something for everyone here: shuffling back-porch blues (""Never Loved Her Anyway,""), sensitive but never sappy ballads (""Mother, Father, Son""), funkified rock (""Tell Me Why"") and lots of full-burn, straight-ahead metal reminiscent of early prime Van Halen (""Outlaw,"" ""Catch Me If You Can""). If you're a fan of good old hard-edged rock/metal with groove, melody and attitude to spare, you can't afford to pass this one up!"
4,4.5,"Solid 'hair metal'!!! John souds great and the songs stick in your head!!! if your a fan of 80's music (hair-metal), your sure to enjoy this!!!"
5,One of the best rock CD's EVER!!!!!!,"First of all.all I can do is give praise to Spitfire Records for re-releasing this over looked MASTERPIECE of the 80's style of rock.You know,back when the melody and lyrics mattered AKA The good ole days.Anyway,why John Corabi is not a super star is beyond me.Truly he has the perfect rock voice.Down and dirty for Every Inch a Woman.Sensitive for Father,Mother,Son.Bluesy for Man in the Moon.If this reveiew makes no sense.just TRUST me and get this CD.You'll not regret it!!!"
4,Great CD!,I had heard a lot about this CD over the years. Finally decided to pick it up after seeing John Corabi live sing one of the songs acoustically. Glad I did. This CD rocks! Wish I knew the story as to why they split up. Def. a good pick up.
5,John Corabi at his absolute best!,"I bought this cd when it first came out back in 1991. The band came out of Seattle and was all over the airwaves in the Northwest. I was raised in Portland and people were going crazy over these guys. I think that this cd never got the recognition that it deserved. I am very pleased to see that it was re-released for other people to discover and enjoy. This album really rocks! Even though this cd came out 12 years ago, it still sounds very up to date."
5,man in the moon,first things first I also had this tape yes tape in 1991. It was one of the best kick arse tapes around.It also took me a long time to find it.Thank the stars I found it.So in short it would be great having this in my collection of hard to find music.
4,More for the comitted fan,"This album is the soundtrack for a 1983 20+ minute short film called ""Johnny Yesno."" The film itself is extremely difficult to find, I'm fortunate to own a VHS copy of it.At any rate, the music is not as accesible as some of their other mid-career albums might be; many of the pieces are variations on a theme, and it is certainly not music you can dance to.If you are a die-hard fan, you must have this album. If you are a casual fan, I might put this towards the bottom of your list, priority-wise. If you are a newbie, then start off with (first choice) ""The Covenant, The Sword, The Arm of the Lord,"" or ""Microphonies,"" or ""The Crackdown."" These are the easiest for non-Industrial initiates to get into."
1,Not to my liking,"I picked this up on recommendation from a sales clerk at a local book store. The author writes in a style that combines the pithy superlative adjectives of the romance novel with the uninspired characterisations of the moralistic tripe shovelled into the young adult market. While I cannot fault Liam's grasp of history (shamelessly pro-Ireland, I might add, and almost to a fault,) I lament that its presentation had to adopt a form best bound with a torn bodice on the cover."
5,Just Who Are The Ladies Making All Those B-Movies?,"Jewel Shepard took it upon herself to contact a dozen or soof the past and current B-Movie Queens. Jewel's book containsher interviews, along with photos, of some of the most popularB-Movie and ""Scream Queens"" from the 50's to the present.Jewel's questions draw out the people behind the images on the screenand gives their insights into the B-Movie business. I foundJewel's interviews funny and interesting. Most of the womenknew what they were doing and saw B-Movies as an opening tobigger and better things."
4,Only solution for road handlebars,"No bartape can match these, especiallly if you ride in the rain. Bartape will come off easily in the rain but these solve that problem. They are vastly superior to the cheaper Sunlite foam grips. Much thicker foam for better durability and vibration dampening. Also made in America! Only downside is the difficulty of installation. One must use laundry (not dish) soap and a strong towel to install these, using a twisting motion and a firm grip. Expect to spend a couple of hours if my experience is normal."
1,not really sure what to say,it was very small (as stated) it is supposed to be a single use packet but its just too sweet to use all at once. it didnt at all taste like vanilla and is only good for its intended purpose. it burns anywhere else
2,Misleading Title,"I agree with the reviewers saying this book missed its target. It seems like MacIntyre couldn't find sufficient material for a book about Adam Worth, but went ahead and wrote it anyway. My guess is that there's plenty of information about ""The Duchess of Devonshire,"" and so MacIntyre used that to pad out his manuscript. Worth pulled off plenty of other capers, and I'd like to read about those. What I don't want to read is the author's unsubstantiated speculation about Worth's psyche.If you're interested in the provenance of the ""Duchess,"" this book might be an interesting read. Otherwise, I'd recommend Asbury's ""Gangs of New York."" Two of Worth's contemporaries and sometime associates also wrote books which might be worth tracking down. These were Sophie Lyons and William Pinkerton."
4,Master Mind of Crime,"Ben MacIntyre wrote a very entertaining book about Adam Worth. Although the book covered too much of one part of his life and not much detail on other parts, I found his life story intreguing. A great portion of the book was devoted to the portrait Duchess of Devonshire and not on Worth's love of stealing. Adam Worth led a very deceptive life. It is interesting to find out just what a clever man Adam Worth was. MacIntyre portrayed Worth's life in somewhat a humorus way. Adam Worth wasn't your common thief."
4,"Very good book, but needed more detail on Worth's crime net","This book does a wonderful job of showing us several of the more appealing parts of Adam Worth's personality and world. For example, Worth's interplay with Robert Pinkerton is very intriguing. However, the book does not detail Worth's criminal network which is supposed to be one of the main reasons for Worth's fame. There are details of only a few of his crimes, and no explanation of how his European-wide criminal empire was organized or functioned. Instead, there is too much verbiage spent on his alleged fascination with a stolen portrait. On the whole, the book is very entertaining, being redolent with the same gaslit old-London atmosphere that makes A. Conan Doyle so engrossing. Note to the author: Worth made it directly to the movies in a flick called ""Harry and Walter go to New York"", with James Caan and Elliot Gould. Check it out, too!"
4,Professor Moriarty Unmasked,"This book makes a great follow-up to any collection of Sherlock Holmes tales you may read. It puts the evil Professor, the detective Holmes and the author Conan Doyle in their proper places in Victorian England."
5,Hooray for Adam Worth!,This book is such a fascinating read. The author not only details all of Worth's fascinating exploits and companions but gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the underbelly of Victorian society. I will never read Sherlock Holmes (or see T.S. Eliot's McCavity Cat!) the same way again!
3,Not for fans of Confessions of A Jewel Thief,"I picked this book up because it is heavily promoted by Amazon with Confessions of a Jewel Thief, Bill Mason's larger than life book about being a burglar. These books have nearly nothing in common other than fitting into the true crime genre. Macintyre misses the mark by getting bogged down in details and random facts (his research is impressive, yes) and forgetting to spin a compelling tale. There is too much material here with no cohesive narrative. Many other readers have hit it in the head by identifying the failings of Mason to focus solely on the topic of Worth and his exploits."
1,Lousy concept. Stupid video.,This is out and out garbage. The whole thing stinks of cheap. Fox Lorber/Winstar should be ashamed of themselves putting out junk like this. Not to be confused with THE VERY BEST OF PETER SELLERS which is an excellent tribute. Look for the word VERY in the title of the video so you know you aren't getting this drivel.
1,This is NOT the best of Peter Sellers.,This video looks like it was slapped together in a day. There is no narration or concept. It's just bits and pieces from some of his films and television shows in totally random order. It doesn't come close to representing his best work. It's a huge disappointment. Just rent the movies.
2,"Nice case, cheap belt clip","Love the case, although I did get it way below the listed msrp. After two weeks the plastic belt clip broke. I returned it to the company and they promptly sent a new one that was the wrong clip. I am still waiting for another replacement. If the clip was as good as the case, this would be a nice product."
5,David Wolfes books are king,I really enjoy reading ALL of David Wolfes Book. This does rate right up there with the rest of the health books
2,An Advertisement You Pay For!,"If you like someone promoting their products, website, other books, and seminars while you read - and PAYING to read the ads, then this may book for you. Personally, it irritates the crap out of me and makes me NOT want anything to do with any of them. It only gets 2 stars because 1 means I hate it. There is some good info - but I would get it somewhere else if this kind of thing bothers you."
5,Do not order from A1 Books,Make sure you order from Amazon directly. A1Books takes 3-4 weeks for delivery. I still have not recieved my book!
2,Book,"This book was more scientific than entertaining. If I knew it was going to be this detailed, I probably wouldn't have bought it. I didn't even finish reading it."
1,"Inaccurate, not credible.","He uses Kirlian images to demonstrate that raw foods have more energy, but there's no science to back up the validity of them, and some before-after pictures demonstrate that somtimes, in reality often, after following a raw food regimen people became terribly underweight, emaciated and this is not healthy and some of the herbs suggested in here can be more harmful than helpful."
4,Good but not complete,"I got this book because of the changes I noticed in my face after eating raw egg yolks and chlorella.David Wolfe bores me with his theory on each of the beauty-foods, but it is sometimes interesting. Papaya gives sparkling eyes. Cucumbers are eaten by models. I have begun eating papaya and do notice a difference. MSM and Pumpkin seeds have become more interesting to me than they were before.There are no before and after photos but the Kirlian photos are worth it. I would have liked to see more Kirlian photos with various foods in the same shot. Because all foods are relative to each other. There is one shot in this book of olive oil and pig fat next to each other. The difference is obvious. More shots like that would be good.Wolfe says some things that are wrong but he admits that the book is not complete. I hope we see a complete food-book in the future."
5,Fantastic reading,"I have never really thought in depth about foods that I put in myself and what beauty benefits (and otherwise) they have. So this book was quite interesting to read and learn about every day foods. I was pleasantly surprised that I am doing everything right, at least about 80%. No wonder I look about 10 years younger than others of my age. But it is amazing how beneficial raw food is. I've found a few enticing recipes for salads that I will implement in my daily food intake."
5,TRUE NATURAL BEAUTY!!,"The information is this book is valuable. I use it everytime I need to look up a remedy for some beauty tip. Of course, most of the true remedies for beauty begins with a change in lifestyle....becoming 100% raw (sun) foodist. This is truly the best way to live on every level, physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Beauty involves every aspect of our being, not just the physical. It is about how we feel about ourselves, within the skin. Being a sunfoodist, you come to love yourself. This book is a good start for those who are not yet on the raw food path, as you will come to realize the truth behind natural healing. They really work!!! May you find inspiration in this book that will lead you to become a raw (sun) foodist."
4,Eating For Beauty,"If you are serious about clean food and what it can do for you, this is a GREAT book. Eating raw is a powerful way to get ""the glow""... and David Wolfe delivers both information and recipes plus facts to back up his stuff. I'm pretty hard core about what I eat, and this isn't a ""fluff"" book... great for the serious raw foodie who wants to understand WHY raw is better."
4,Simple and inspirational,"I enjoyed this book and its simple yet deep information which has already help me improve me diet and inspired me towards more raw and healthy food intake. I also find David Wolfes writing style easy to follow and he has good sense of humor, which i enjoyed.I recommend this book!"
3,An Improvement.,"Elektra had picked up where Polydor left off. This album, despite the band for it's weakness, was resurrected by the amazing recording production from Elektra. The two tracks ""Perpetual"" & ""Leviathan"" are honorable mentions with a hint of ""Yngwie Classic"" and the rest is more medieval inspired but somehow still not ""metal"" enough. You'll have to find a more mellowing mood (which seldoms in metal music) to entice the whole album. ""Fire & Ice"" is a bit too long of an album and much commercialized under the label's terms, fortunately that was a short stint. The overall album does sound better than the last two (Odyssey & Eclipse from Polydor) due to the excellent production from Elektra and longtime Yngwie engineers/mixer Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero, they have never sounded better since Yngwie's departure from Polydor."
1,THIS VERSION OF FIRE AND ICE IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN $4,"I WAS SORPRISED WHEN I OPENED MY PACKAGE AND DISCOVER THAT THIS VERSION OF FIRE AND ICE IS A SHIP VERSION OF THE CD, IT DOES NOT BRINGS THE LIRICS CASE IS NOT PLASTIC AND IT COST 12.98 WHILE THE GOOD VERSION COST 14.98 IF YOU LIKE GOOD QUALITY CDS DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY IN THIS FAKE RE ISSUE."
3,A bit lukewarm...,"Not a bad album,rather a mixed bag of songs.While Edman's vocals are fairly competent and Yngwie's fretboard work shines through,some songs are plain fillers-they sould have been left out since they just diminish the impact this album could have had.Highlights are :the title track,'C'est la vie','How Many Miles to Babylon',and 'Final Curtain'."
3,More Ice Than Fire,"While I love Yngwie's music, I have to say I was a little disppointed in this CD. I really wanted to like it and I've given it a spin on repeated occasions to see if it would grow on me, but I find it somewhat difficult to listen to. It doesn't have the same vibrance as many of the Maestro's other releases. As always, technically, Yngwie doesn't disappoint and Goran Edmond shines on the vocals just as he did on Eclipse, but I often find myself getting bored while listening to this CD. It's not a bad CD and not a total waste of money, but I think it will appeal more to die-hard fans and not to the masses. Even though I am a die-hard fan, this CD stays on the shelf more than it gets put in the CD player. Definitely not one of Yngwie's best."
5,one of the best Malmsteen albums,"You will find some classical/orchestral interludes mixed in metal songs, such as ""Forever is a Long Time,"" ""Cry No More,"" and ""No Mercy"". The vocals by Goran are very melodic and many times held out majestically. The songs are very well-written, production is great and guitars awesome. ""Perpetual"" is and instrumental that kicks things off and is alone worth the price of the album. You will find ballads like ""Cry No More"" and ""I'm My Own Enemy"" along with faster songs like ""No Mercy"". The cover art is also cool."
4,Yngwie's Last Hurrah,"I'm Listening to all of my Malmsteen cds as I type this and I can't find one that has more bluesy/rock laden tunes on it than this! Opening with ""Perpetual"", a blistering instrumental testament to his continued viability and ""Dragonfly"" with it's swaggering rock n roll guitar rhythm and solo, and continuing with other cuts like ""C'est La Vie"" and ""Cry No More"" ,he crafted a masterpiece here that none of his later albums came anywhere near topping! ""Black Star"" (from RISING FORCE) and ""Dragonfly"" go with me on my phonechip everywhere! None of the tracks from here even made it to the ""Collection"" and I can't figure out how that travesty happened because this was one of his ALL TIME BEST!"
3,Not A Bad Album,"I can't say I was really disappointed when I bought this album when it was released. I admit that it's quite a different direction from the previous Eclipse album. Fire and Ice is more experimental and progressive, but still has elements from Eclipse in it. As always, the guitar playing is good, and Goran Edman doesn't disappoint with his vocals (I think that he's been Yngwie's best vocalist). ""How Many Miles to Babylon,"" and ""Cry No More,"" are the standout tunes in my opinion. Not a disappointing album totally."
2,get a regular checkers set,"My 5 3/4 year-old daughter, a big Dora fan, received this game for Christmas. While the playing pieces are cute (it's Dora vs. Swiper), I would definitely recommend using a regular checkers set instead. It is easy to knock a whole bunch of them down if you accidently bump one while reaching across the board. The crowns that are provided don't fit. Swiper's crowns will stay on with some readjusting, but the crowns cover up his eyes. Dora's crowns don't fit or stay on, even upside down, in our experience, no matter what you do. Also, playing checkers didn't hold my daughter's attention for an entire game. I assume that this is because of her age. Of course, as she gets older and more able to understand the planning, predicting and maneuvering that can make checkers fun, she's not going to have much interest in Dora and company any more."
1,Cute but not functional,"I had same experience as other reviewer. Crowns do not fit, no matter what. Checkers is a tough game for the age group that would be interested in Dora. My daughter and her friends take it out and mock play checkers, get board quickly and leave the game on the floor. These crowns are sharp and are very painful if stepped on. I do not recommend this game at all and certainly would not buy it for a gift."
3,"Sure, a geat jazz critic but a typical Eastener.","I've read some Martin Williams writings and plan to get back to his published books. He is extremely knowledgable but apparently he never heard of anything west of Chicago. If you jazz fans out there think that West Coast jazz and the jazz scene here was not worth exploring, then I should send you a copy of a letter I e-mailed to Bob Parlocha who probably has the best syndicated program in the U.S. I told him of my experiences catching live music from my college days and after. You'd be suprised how much music and musicians were here in California, I could have listed a lot more like Oliver Nelson, Lee Konitz, Warren Marsh, Art Pepper, etc.I've caught jazz clubs in New York, D.C., Philadelphia and the West Coast ranks with them."
4,The Bard Waxes Rhapsodic,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
2,Probably better on stage,"Yes, this is a re-working of The Tempest from a Caribbean perspective. Cesaire basically extrapolates Shakespeare's anti-colonial criticism and backfits the story into that scheme. Of course, the play is modernized and packed with civil rights movement references. Caliban has a stronger role, but very hackneyed. This play reads like a political pamphlet; everything is spelled out for you. I think it has social importance, but from a literary standpoint it was forgettable."
5,"Like always, Jossie Esteban's music is excellent............","Well I must say that this is a very good album. Forget about the idea that music will make you wanna dance if you don't want to. You will dance to this album regardless. Besides, isn't that is what merengue is about anyway? Having fun and dancing? The songs ""la colota"" ""brindo por esa mujer"" ""ta canon"" ""yo me enamore"" are all some very hot songs... Jossie Esteban Y la patrulla 15 never stops bringing you what they know best. And that's pure mambo and tigueraje. CON FUERZA!!!!!!PapyDavid #1 (EL PUNAL)"
3,Strong debut by an overlooked band,"The Madchester influence is quite apparent in 'Pigeonhole', but the New Fast Automatic Daffodils bring a bit more to the table. Front and center is the baggy-vibes sensibility of Madchester, with the beats/rhythms strongly resembling The Charlatans UK first 2 albums. The vocals have this lazy Julian Cope-type drawl, an interesting backdrop to the guitar-work, which seems to be a combination of different influences. A fusion of spikey post-punk riffs (The Jam, The Rapture, Interpol) and funk noodlings, ala, 'Fools Gold' by The Stone Roses and The Happy Mondays. This is one half of the equation, with the other half derived from fluid Smiths/Britpop-like guitar-lines, eg, Shed 7, The Darling Buds, Suede, etc. An strong and interesting debut, a precursor of what was to come in 4 or 5 years."
1,The quick mitre adjustment is a POS!,The saw works great going just straight on light wood...as soon as you add in heavier stock or curves good luck keeping at whatever angle setting you dialed in. It can be 90 even and the saw I think just vibrates itself loose.I upgraded to a JS660 on sale for less than I paid for this junk tool.
4,Good product!,"Item description is nearly accurate. They say blue yet the one's that were shipped to me were purple. Not my favorite color but I can get over that. I used them for inside a carpeted gun safe and they work EXCELLENTLY! The velcro on the back is pretty low grade stuff the lights are intense white LED's that light the inside of my safe, again, EXCELLENTLY. Overall, I am glad I bought these. I am actually buying more."
4,Multi-Functional Locker Lights,"Wasn't expecting much in the way of light output or sensitivity from the motion sensor. Maybe it was the color of the unit that made the whole thing look so cheesy. To my surprise, the light output was perfect for its intended purpose and for the little jobs I assigned them around the house. I loaded all 4 units up with batteries and placed them throughout the house in the evening. The light output was perfect for lighting a section of hallway or illuminating the path in the bedroom, kitchen, living room, etc. I've been checking Amazon off & on for the past couple of months hoping to find them on sale again but no luck yet. If they do come back, I'll be buying 4-8 more just to have some around the house for ""whatever""."
3,Light is dim,"Product works very well, however the light it emits is dim. Most areas used required several in order to completely illuminate."
3,For limited indoor use only,"Some of the reviews here suggest that this product is suited for outdoor purposes, but I find that not to be the case. The effective range of coverage of the product is very limited, and the light produced is insufficient for almost any outdoor purpose (a possible exception being a light placed almost adjacent to a doorknob to facilitate inserting a key, assuming one lacked a porch light for some reason). For indoor use within a relatively small and enclosed room, this product seems suitable. Generally speaking, this product should be seen only as convenience lighting under limited circumstances. It is not security lighting, nor would it likely be bright enough to help a person with limited vision move through a room with variable or unfamiliar obstacles."
3,silver spring. md,i am a huge luis miguel fan and will be forever.. i go to every concert he has in my corner of the world.... But! i was a little disappointed in this cd & dvd. i was really hoping for NEW music from him. the dvd which contains his videos that have been seen by many people in the spanish speaking community and on spanish MTV.... i am hoping that his NEXT cd whenever that is will contain all NEW material..... BUT I STILL LOVE HIM TO DEATH!!!!
3,Another Collection,"You often wonder if the record executives are milking everything they can.Here is a fine collection, nonetheless of previously released Boleros from the great one himself. The songs are CLASSIC.The DVD though is very disappointing...horrible audio with no presence (wish it coulda been better, had I known I would have saved my money)."
4,Hard core remoting code,"The authors certainly know what they are talking about in this book. But you will have to keep running to keep up. Most of the concepts are explained through copious amounts of code with little in the way of exposition. Tips and best practices are in the book, and I certainly appreciated that. A solid, if not completely pleasurable read for anyone interested in remoting with C#."
4,label maker tape,"was not able to find this product anywhere else, of course was able to find it here and the price was right too. thank you Amazon.com"
5,Wonderful and comforting!,"This book was given to me in the 1990's after I went through a terrible situation. Since then, I have passed this book on to others and have re-purchased it three times to replace the ones I have given away. It helps to ""clear your head"" and give you some peace."
3,CUTE,"I got this for my daughter. I don't know if mine was defective but it was really hard to actually make sounds with the little shell mallets. My daughter would hit the keys with it, and all I would hear was a ""clunk"" sound. Which was just the sound of the plastic mallet hitting the plastic key. She plays with it once in a while, but I wish it would make better music."
4,Teaching the Individual,"I would recommend this book to any teacher who wishes to learn more ways to reach his or her students. The emphasis is placed on how to teach each child as an individual rather than as a mass of faceless test scores. Even if you don't walk away with all the answers, it gives you plenty of tools to develop your own."
4,Impressed,This book is one of many essential guides for the beginning teacher. Ayers experience embodies the the moral and ethical duties of what our future educators need to know in order to prepare the adults of the future.
4,good book,"This book gave great information that I will use in the classroom, when I begin teaching. I highly recomend this book to any one who wants to be a teacher, no matter what grade level."
3,"Not Quite As Described, But Made Right","The book was described as new, but came damaged; the binding was coming undone. When speaking with the seller about it, they said it was fine when they sent it and that they had ""only used it for one semester"" at school... which doesn't really scream ""new"" to me. The seller gave back a good portion of our money to make the sell right, though, so I would be willing to use this seller again. They were quick to fix the issue and very kind about it."
5,A must for all those directly involved in education.,"Rarely does a book change your perspective on a subject and then provide you with on-going thoughts that then change you, especially books written about education. This one does. It is a must for all those involved in education that wish to further their view of creating learning environments for meaningful lessons. Teachers, preservice teachers, and teacher educators will benefit from this wonderful read. Ayers lifts the words off the page, tranforming them into carefully composed lyrics that are obviously written by a teacher who cares for the well-being of children in today's world.If you like kids, you'll like what you read in this book. If you want to improve your teaching, you'll receive some great ideas for doing so; expect no recipes or prescriptions, though, because this journey begins with you. Don't miss this opportunity."
5,This,"This book is one that each and every teacher should read. It is valuable not only because of the content (which is exceptional), it is also very easy to read. I would recommend this book to any teacher."
1,"A short sighted, oversimplified book","The method suggested is practical but its failure to address the fundamental questions of ""What is the Solution for?, and Why does it exist (what is its purpose?)"" and a few others besides will result in managers making short sighted, short term changes that are likely to cause significant, unforseen systemic problems with time.Someone buy the author a System Dynamics textbook. In my view its failure to take the complex and inter-connected nature of reality into account and obsession with oversimplified comparison tables/matrices dooms the book to starting the fire at home."
1,poor quality leis,"The order came in a timely fashion, but the product was quite poor itself. The lei's were thin, flattend from the shipping, thin, plastic, and cheap looking at the party.... a bit dissapointed. not worth the money I paid."
2,Booo!,This movie is not good. This movie is a martial arts flick without the benefit of descent fight scenes. I know the cast is capable of more. This movie is about a cop trying to free his precint from corruption. Much of his rage comes from the fact that his partner Zoey was killed by chriminals who were fed thier location. Zoey is then turned into a cyborg milatry soldier whos uniform is a diamond studded leather teddy. Dispite having no emotions she trys to be sensual she smiles and laughs and has technical difficulties when people say her name.The only redeeming factors are the training scenes where Bolo Yeung performs kata with Billy Blanks. I loved seeing them move the way that fighters do. It's better than trying to make Zoey the swimsuit cyborg do funky backflips without showing any angles to verify her identity.I give this movie three stars for great training scenes and -1 star for embarrassing themselves for the rest of the movie
5,Great saute pan!,Lightweight and very easy to clean! From stove top to oven a great add to my kitchen. Glad I purchased this pan.
4,every cook should have one!,"This is such a great pan, I want to get one like it a bit smaller! It's perfect for all-in-one meals and it fits well in the sink (because there's no long handle on one side that keeps it from sitting flat) making it's so easy to clean! I do use hot-pads on the ""cool-touch"" handles as they seem a bit too warm for me. A pan this size needs two handles when it's filled with food so this design just works great. Though it's not as pretty as the SS models, it can still be used as a serving dish for casual meals. I prefer the non-stick surface for the type of cooking I do in this pan. All this for a really fantastic price!!"
4,Great pan for the money,"This is a nice sized pan for cooking that little bit bigger meal. I really like the glass lid, it has a nice weight to it.The only complaint is that with the sloped sides, browning hamburger tends to creep up the sides and over the edge as you crumble it, though I would still recommend the pan and just pay more attention to my cooking."
1,cuisinart chefs pan,"the bottom of the pan is warped, does not sit flat on the stove. the lid is very good."
1,Not round!,"I am extremely disappointed. The discription of this pan implies that it is round. It is not, it is an oval! Heating on a round burner is wasteful and risks burning pot holders and anything else that gets close to the surface that is not covered by the pan."
1,as pictured... not as described,"This 12"" everyday pan with a ""brilliant mirror-polished exterior"" does NOT have the ""brilliant mirror-polished exterior."" The exterior is just as pictured. I ordered two of these pans TWICE from Macy's (where this ships from) and they were NOT shiny on the outside. They are the black ""can't be put into the dishwasher"" color."
5,Perfect for us,"We love this skillet, it is just the right size for the 4 of us. I have nothing negative to say about it."
5,Better than expect,"I am very pleased with my Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick 12"" Pan with a glass lid. Food cooks so easy in this pan and it's deep enough to cook for a family of five. It isn't too heavy to pick up and the handles do not get hot when cooking."
4,Cuisinart Chef's Nonstick Hard-anodized Pan,Price of the pan is reasonable. Very handy to use and the heat is even. Suitable to shallow fry with the glass cover to avoid spattering of oil.
5,"Wow, our favorite.","What a deal...great way to make a meal. Good size, nice lid, cooks and cleans well. Quality Product."
1,Warped,"We have a glass top stove and have the best luck with pans that an extra thick bottom. After reading the reviews, I thought this pan would work well for us. I was disappointed to find it had the regular rounded bottom that most cheap pans have, though I remained hopeful as the pan felt substantial and sturdy.I do like the handles and the lid, but after one use the pan warped horribly and now rocks on our glass top stove. It won't cook evenly and is a huge pain to use.We had much better luck with a Simply Calphalon pan that is no longer available here. I'm not sure what it is called, but the Calphalon pan we had previously had a thick, flat bottom that looked like a separate piece. Really nice and perfect for our stove."
3,Good pan ... for a while,"This was a great pan when I first bought it. The non-stick was perfect, it heated evenly and cleaning it was a breeze. 18 months later and the non-stick surface is not so non-stick anymore. It's still usable, but I would say that within the year I will need to replace this pan. For the price I paid, I suppose it's not so bad. But with the Cuisinart name I would have thought it would last longer than that."
4,basically amazing,Wonderful! perfect size! Only reason for 4 stars & not 5 is that the handles do get pretty hot due to proximity to the pan.
4,4 and 1/2 stars,"I bought this several months ago to supplement my 14-piece Cuisinart cookware set. I love it and use it often for cooking dishes in the oven, from Mahi-Mahi to macaroni and cheese.A few disappointed reviewers have commented on the unevenness of the nonstick coating. I have never had this problem with Cuisinart, but agree that the company should replace any bad-apple, defective items immediately. You deserve a chance to enjoy these pans....Mine has been super easy to clean (including getting melted cheese off the interior rivets) and I've experienced no scratching, flaking or bubbling of the Quantanium surface. None of my pans has warped, lost shape or anything similar. They look, feel and perform as solid, sophisticated cookware.The pan is large (12"" across, worth noting if you use an electric coil stove top) and slightly shallow; ideally, I'd like the pan to be one inch smaller in diameter and one inch deeper. But it works great and I'd recommend to anyone."
3,"Nice, except one problem","This is a nice pan and the non-stick coating is great. The one problem is that it is not flat on the bottom. On my smooth top range, it wobbles and spins around very easily, which makes it difficult to stir, flip, etc. It also makes me wonder about even heating, though I have not used it for a large batch of anything, yet."
2,It was great until it started sticking... disposable pan..,"This was my first Hard anodized piece as I had previously used non stick and stainless and occasional cast iron 12"" skillet. When I first got the pan I loved it. The size is perfect for everything and the finish was really nice.. That was a little bit over 2 years ago. About 6 mohths ago food started sticking in the middle unless I used butter or a liquid something with it. I already have stainless skillets If I wanted that then I would have used those. I stopped using teflon years ago from several incidences of it coming off in food. I finally gave up and ordered a 15 inch cast iron skillet instead. It will do everything this one will do and isnt disposable and foods dont stick. Heavy, yes, but for 2 years vs a life time.. Ill go back to old fashioned cast iron."
4,Pleased so far,"I typically stay away from products that can't be put in the dishwasher, but I needed a new pan, & due to promotions I basically was able to get this pan for free. I have been pleasantly surprised. It's great non-stick, it has a nice lid, and it hand-washes great (and I've had some pretty sticky stuff in there).The only downside was that I actually needed a 10-inch pan, not 12-inch. I decided not to hassle with returning it, and I've got another nice 12-inch pan now."
5,Great Pan!!,"I have been using this pan almost daily since I received it. It's a great pan . . . large enought for most anything, the pan heats evenly, the cover fits well and clean up is effortless. I only wish I would have bought two of these pans."
5,Love this skillet!,"This skillet is amazing. Meat and Veggies cook perfectly and evenly with a decent amount of oil. I made Brussel Sprouts in this skillet (sauted it lightly and stuck the whole thing in the oven) and it came out really well. Good quality pan. 12"" is perfect for cooking enough for 2 people and having some leftovers. The only semi-negative comment I have is: The handles are small and made of iron so it gets really hot. Do not attempt to pick this skillet up with bare hands or you'll get burnt!"
5,A favorite pan,"Wow, Where do I start? The Price! For (...) a non-stick anodized 12 pan! What a deal. many have spent 3 time as much or more. The quality?Amazing! I enjoy the weight of the pan, not too heavy. It heats up well with no cold spots. I use it to sautee, stir fry, omletts , grilled sandwiches, I always coat the pan with a little oil. (A force of habit)nothing to do with the quaility of the pan. I enjoy cooking with it clean up is a breeze. I like the handles, my cooking space is small and didn't want handles that stood out. It comes with a glass lid. Very nice. Buy this you won't regret it. Makes a great gift for someone just starting out. Oh and I forgot the pan works just fine in the oven.It's March 2008 and I still love this pan! It's March 2010 and the pan has starting sticking. Broiled salmon in it and it had to be pryed off. Oh well. Still love this pan. Oh well back to shopping list you must go. I am getting another one."
5,Great Pan!,"This has got to be the best pan that I have ever bought. I love the fact that it is versatile and large enough to fit a whole family meal in. I have had mine for six months now and it is as good as the day that I bought it. I have used it to cook a variety of meals and never had a problem. The dome cover is excellent. It makes viewing and covering the food extra easy. The only time that I do not use it is if I am frying something that cannot have the extra moisture. Then I use theProgressive International Deluxe Splatter ScreenIt fits perfectly and makes even fried foods easy. I like both of them so much that I recently bought them as gifts for my dad. I haven't used it in the oven yet, but I look forward to it. Basically if you want an all purpose pan that can handle it all, then this is the pan for you."
3,Handy pan but non-stick will not last,"I bought this pan just over 3 years ago. I loved it - it truly was an ""everyday"" pan and I used it for everything, fried eggs, simmering pasta sauce, stir fries, fried rice etc.. But after a couple of years, the non stick wore off. Even if I coat it in oil and pre-heat it, everything will stick. So fried eggs are a thing of the past, fried rice is also not worth it and after another year with a diminishing list of dishes I used this for, I now use this once a week or less and am in the market for a different pan."
2,warped on arrival,Just got the pan and its going back. The bottom was warped right out of the box. Between this experience and that of a few other reviews just not sure whether to ask for another and just get my money back. It is a pretty light gauge and I wonder how long it will take to warp if I should get one that's flat. Its just the type of pan I wanted and its a great value - but only if its flat!!
3,I love the size of it but...,"The size of this pan, the perfect fit of the lid, and the nice finish on the inside are all positive and fabulous ... however, the pan warped after about the 5th or 6th use and now it spins on our glass stovetop and it's incredibly annoying."
2,Bottom warped,"I've used this pan for about 2 years and am now searching for an alternative. It has gotten so warped that it no longer heats evenly across the bottom. We like to pan sear steaks and chops, and it's a real hassle when the pan does not heat evenly. We use an LG electric glass cooktop and have not seen this problem with other pots or pans. The warping began about 6 months in and has gotten progressively worse. I think that the problem is that the pan is the same thickness (or thinness) all over. That makes it very lightweight, but also keeps it from sitting flat on the stove. I hope one with a thicker bottom will work better and for longer. Sorry that I could not be more positive.p.s. When they say wash by hand, they mean it. The dishwasher leaves ugly spots all over the surface. Not a factor for us, but if you like pretty pots, something to consider."
5,Husbands Pan,"I just replaced my first Cuisinart Chefs Pan after 3 heavily used years of service. I call this pan the Husbands Pan since this is the only pan my husband has no issues with when he uses it and it's the only pan he grabs for when hes on duty to cook. very simple to clean up, no long handles sticking out the sides ( only smooth handles for gripping) you don't have to perfectly position this pan on the stove so that the long handle isn't jabbing you while you cook. the glass lid fits just right for ease of removal. the only issue (no fault of the pans) is operator error using metal utensils does speed up the the life expectancy of the pans usage."
5,Great product!!,It's crazy how non-stick this amazing pan is! I never need to use any oil...food just slides right off! I love this pan!!
4,No lid,I purchased this based on previous experience with Cuisinart product. The picture shows a glass lid but mine didn't come with one. So far so good
1,Worst Pan Ever!,I have always had the utmost regard for Cuisinart and their quality of products. That is until I purchased this pan. This pan is warped on the bottom. Does not sit flat and rocks constantly. It also does not distribute the heat evenly. Everytime I use it I am frustrated and disappointed. It is worse than the cheap set of Farberware I got when I first moved out on my own 14 years ago. Ridiculous. I HATE this pan. I have no idea why I hate this pan so much and so many seem to love it. I wish I had gotten something else.
5,I use this everyday.,"Breakfast, lunch, dinner. I can poach, saut√©, make crispy bacon. Be sure to use right utensils or it will scratch coating. Easy to clean."
4,Good...not great...,"In my situation the unit loses a star because it warped. Only slightly mind you, but enough to make it no longer flat. And flat is what is needed for a ceramic cook top. Would that I could, that ceramic stove would be a gas one, but what are you going to do? By warping it requires just that more juice and it is less stable on the surface. The non stick surface appears to be very durable, but I have only had it a short time and so cannot comment to its durability over time."
3,Just OK,"The pan size and handle style work well, but the gauge of aluminum is light so that after the first few uses the bottom warped and is not flat enough for a smooth top cook surface. That was the main reason for the purchase. This also causes the center 4"" or so too become too hot on the flat rang top. I was replacing cast iron, which is a much better choice."
2,Did not last long,"I bought this pan 11 months ago. It was beautiful to look at when I got it. However, the bottom did not sit flat on my flat surface range top. It worked great initially except I do prefer a long handle. After 8 month or so, food started to stick. Now I cannot cook anything starchy with it. I called Cuisinart asking about the life-time warranty. I was given an order number and told to ship the pan in. I will have to pay shipping + $10 check. They will inspect the pan and decided if it is a defect. I decided not to bother with that. I will not buy Cuisinart in the future."
5,love this pan,"from stove top to oven, food actually cooks and tastes better in this amazingly easy to use pan."
3,Hard to clean,"I bought this because the price was so good and I wanted to test the general line before buying a set. The pan is nice and sturdy, and it heats very evenly, so I'm not sorry I bought it (given the deep discount).But I won't be buying more pieces. I think there's a terrible design flaw: the rivets attaching the handles (small silver buttons on the inside of the pan) make it much harder to clean than it should be. I cooked something with a sauce that clung to those little buttons, and had to use a brush, not just a sponge or net-covered sponge, to get the residue off.I checked the photos of the pieces in the set, and the saucepans, at least, show the same little rivets inside the pans. It's too bad, because otherwise this is a really wonderful piece of cookware. But I'll be looking for a set that has a completely smooth surface inside."
2,The most annoying pan in the world.,"This is one of the most disappointing pans I have ever owned. The pan is disappointing because it has a great cooking surface and cooks food wells,but it suffers from a fatal flaw. The first time you put this pan to heat, it is going to warp and you will the most annoying pan in the world.I have a flat top cook surface, and every time I do anything inside of the pan, be flip a piece of chicken, or stir a sauce, the entire pan starts spinning like an old record. Add to that the warped bottom of the pan and you have a product not worth buying."
1,Bottom warped,"I bought this based on recommnedations from Test Kitchen and a friend. The pan was flat out of the box, but warped after a couple uses. Very disappointed."
2,Loving It While It Lasted,"I purchased this Cuisinart 12"" Everyday Pan w/Lid several years ago here on Amazon. First, it is what it is. A great everyday pan that can be used for just about everything! So, why the low rating. First, the coating scratched way to easily. After several years it looked like it had been in use for a decade. Secondly, the pan warped. It no longer is flat on the bottom. Probably, due to high heat. Isn't a pan supposed to take the heat? The bottom line is I am now buying another one and choose to try another brand. Hope this helps. If you want one for a few years, great. If you want one for many years, look elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,"If you asked me a year ago, I would have said this was my favorite everyday pan - slippery non-stick coating, even heat, glass lid, oven proof, sturdy handles, but after two years use, the non-stick coating has worn almost completely away from the bottom of the pan even with hand-washing and wooden/plastic utensils. Just about anything now sticks horribly. Not too impressive for a pan that supposedly retails for $80.Yes, it comes with a ""life-time warranty"", but that means paying for shipping both ways which comes close to the original purchase price...assuming Cuisinart will replace it. I would not buy another one."
5,Perfect pan,"I use this pan almost every day for something - vegetables, fish, ground meat, whatever. I have had for about 5 months and nothing has stuck yet. Hopefully it will stay that way, but so far, so good!"
4,I like this pan,This pan has replaced my warped chicken fryer. I do not miss the long handle. Works good. I do wish it was a little heavier.
4,Good for the price,"Admittedly, you get what you pay for with photographic equipment. Go cheap and it shows. But for my work, I honestly haven't needed a good CP filter in years. So I decided to get this one to play around with before spending considerably more.And I have to admit, I really like this thing. The filter is clear, edge to edge and doesn't show any distortion or decrease in sharpness (one of the problems with cheap filters). In fact, out of the tests I ran it through, my only complaint is that it will likely increase the odds of lens flare if shooting outdoors. So bring a lens hood."
4,Nice filter!,"I went out and put this filter on a 70-300mmVR and took some animal shots at the zoo and it came out pretty good, Very nice filter, Although it was made in philippines and not japan, It still gives you a color correction and glass protection, Good filter for the money, I love the construction quality of this filter. So far I owned two made in philippines filter and they are serving me well. So for those who are looking for where this filter made from? I don't think it matters where it made from as long as it's the same company!"
5,Very good filter,"- I can honestly say that this is a very good filter not only for its price, because it performs good.- I haven't noticed any softness issue so far.- Metal ring construction is very high quality, ring tightness is well balanced.- Ring thickness is good enough to rotate filter easily for desired effect.- Filter is made of a good quality glass"
5,Great Blues,"Seriously must have! I am loving the blue skies I'm getting, it's allowing me to get better exposures of panoramas. Downside would be that the packaging it comes with is large and hard to carry around, wish it was more of a case for it."
1,Don't buy -falls apart,"Works fine when it works, but it fell apart into two pieces after just three uses. I treat my stuff with kid gloves, too. I don't know what went wrong, but that was $60 down the drain."
5,good product for money,Received this quickly and it was just what I wanted. Good value . Good product. I would recommend this.
1,1st time I used it the glass filter fell out it's holder which screws onto the lens-thus bad quality had to ship it back to get,"this time the quality f the Polarizer wasn't too good- it was defective- while trying to screw the filter onto my camera lens the glass Polarizer fell onto the ground.... quality control was not so good @ the Hoya factory!Had to mail it back to get it replaced, the replacement has NOT come in yet!"
5,Romance of the Open Road,"In period illustrations and delightful text, this book, to be read for pleasure or information, abundantly captures the romance of the open road."
5,SAVING ROCK N ROLL,"Findland's FLAMING SIDEBURNS are MIND BLOWING...this is probably the best ROCK N ROLL album to come out in the past couple years, and one of the best live shows around by far. ...AMAZING ENERGY, GREAT SONGS, GREAT LOOK. These guys are what ROCK SHOULD BE... ALWAYS ROCKING ALL THE TIME! LOOSE MY SOUL, UP IN FLAMES, and BLOW THE ROOF are great... If I could give this CD more than 5 stars, I would! They are that good. Do yourself a favor and get this (or any of their other releases) and prepare to get addicted...If they come to your area, go see them immediatly, you won't be dissapointed!***NOTE*** this CD is similar in content to their release ""HALLEJUAH ROCK 'N' ROLL"", except for 3 tracks."
2,HAte the Layout,"First of all I and my children enjoy all the Mr. Putter and Tabby stories, they are great. Unfortunately who ever converted this series to Kindle format didn't do this series any justice. There will be a page that looks copied directly from a paper book, the image small and faint and tiny text. then there will be full sized picture, and then the next page will be regular kindle text. So you will read one page and then skip over then next couple or you will be reading the same text twice and straining your eyes. Too frustrating for me as an adult and I know I young reader wouldn't even bother. I strongly suggest checking out these ebooks from your local library before purchasing."
2,"nice book, bad kindle",i downloaded the kindle for my daughter but it is extremely poorly done. the pictures and text are repetitious and it becomes annoying really quickly. someone needs to pare this down a little and make it more user friendly. wish i hadn't spent the five bucks.
4,Cold myth perpetuated,"Other than perpetuating the myth that you get a cold by going outside in the cold without a hat, this was a cute story."
5,Best of the Series (So Far),"I've read the Mr. Putter & Tabby books with both of my children. It's a wonderful series for the beginning reader. This title is my favorite of the entire series. Mr. Putter has a cold and remembers what made him feel better when he was a boy. Chicken soup, some hot tea and an adventure book loaned by Mrs. Teaberry's dog, Zeke make this cold worth having. It perfectly captures just how much fun a sick day can be."
2,"Wonderful short story, poor Kindle formatting","First, it is important to say that this is a wonderful short story. Our boys, 4.5 and 6.5, love the whole series. That said, none of us can ignore the dreadful Kindle formatting. Some pages are mysteriously duplicated. Some exist as images of whole pages from the original book, others as disembodied text without their context. The images are small and occupy only part of the screen, unless you zoom in on them, but then it is impossible to scroll to the next page without exiting zoom mode. All in all, the Kindle format translates extremely poorly to picture books like this."
3,We were thinking it would be different,"This book, which mentions Christianity throughout although the preview doesn't mention it, is divided into three sections: Ideas, Finding Time, and Finding Money. We were hoping more for games and activities than what we found here."
1,Family Fun with the Bible and Christianity,"Wow! I can't believe I purchased this book--knowingly and willingly! Had I known it was a guide on how to turn just about every family event into ""fun and games with the Bible and Christianity"", I certainly wouldn't have. Yikes!!! It's jam-packed with references to Christianity, including Bible quotes, and preaches that everyone's neighbors should be Christian! If not, Ellis urges the reader to organize a family proselytizing event so the neighbors can discover the error of their ways! Does Ellis have any clue that there are other religions, not to mention atheists and agnostics in the world? I think not! She actually opens her family holiday chapter with ""Is there a man, woman, boy, or girl alive who does not love Christmas?""!! This is more than offensive! I do, however, give the book one star on behalf of any fundamentalist Christian readers that want help designing every aspect of their family's life around Christianity."
4,Good music,"The album doesn't really flow, but it's not supposed to. It's just all the music you wanted from the movie. Great movie btw"
5,Missing Track,"The Aphex Twin track that many wonder about is called ""Omgyjya Switch7"" off of the Drukqs album."
1,Poor Effort,"I was half-way through the book, and very disappointed with the writing, when I flipped back and saw the disclaimer behind the title page, ""This book is a work of fiction. Places, events and situations in this story are purely fictional . . . ""I was expecting a serious, new work, with perhaps a different look at this bloody battle. What we get is mix of facts gleaned from other, more serious works, and fiction that reads like junior high school writings.I can only echo the previous reviewers disappointment. Spelling, grammar, and factual errors are very distracting, but even more serious is the lack of any story line. It's a boring, erroneous, disjointed and uninspired work.Definitely skip this one."
3,a clash of cliques,"when the personal lives and political positions of the members of law firms take precedence over the portrayal of a social issue in a judicial setting,a novel ceases its claim to the genre of legal fiction. this book is about wealth,privilege and one-upmanship, not about any quest for justice.its tone is swallow and spiteful. it is unfortunate that the author does not follow his own advice about story-telling(p.308):""it's meant to grow on you.you're supposed to become involved in the characters and want to know what's going to happen to them."" these characters are nearly indefensible."
5,"Finally, A Man with no guile!","The well constructed step by step, clear and concise explanation on where replacement theology comes from and it's gnostic alegorized roots. How a Jewish sect became greek sophistry. Thanks Mr. Diprose, for weakening the roots of a long lived anti-semetic forest."
2,Comparing,I have been looking into this subject and got this book to obtain one side of the discussion. I was disappointed in that he quotes verses selectively and did not really deal head on with the argument from the other side. For me this was deceptive and not useful to me in getting to the bottom of the issue.
3,Peeler kind of OK,"I've used better peelers, the scrapping part doesn't rotate easily and it works better coming back than going forward. I have it, I'll use it, but I wouldn't recomend it."
3,"Bachmann provides runable. operable, reasonably detailed model.","Bachmann has become the premier middle price range HO scale producer. Reasonably detailed, good operational characteristics, this model has overly long couplers to accommodate narrow radius track curves. An alternative ""close coupling"" adjustment would be a great improvement as would a detail kit including separate handrails and grab irons plus diaphram. Overall a fine product for mid-market modelers."
1,"Help!!! I can not push ignition button, after pressing on continuous","The torch works ok when I keep the ignition button on. But when I try to turn on the 'hands free"" option,called 'continuous'. I follow all the directions: pull down safety lock, press 'continuous' button after that,at this point ignition button become impossible to push. I tried with all my force!!!Does someone know, what is wrong?"
3,their logical conclusion?,"After a few records of punk-to-new wave, then a few more of new-wave influenced pop, Wire made this CD of alternate takes on their song ""Drill"" from a previous album. The band moved from standard, if a tad minimal, guitar-driven punk to electronica, in the course of 8 or so albums. This, along with the WIR album from the same year, The First Letter, is the last stop along this route.I didn't like this CD upon listening to it a few times. It all seemed repetitive and dull to me, not even energizing. I was basically used to material from Wire's first three albums, which is much different, very punky.Now, after listening to it off and on for a few months, I can say that it ages well. A few tracks stand out, notably In Every City? and A Chicago Drill (live).For the casual fan of the group Wire, this CD is not a necessary purchase. But for fans of experimental-leaning electronic dance music, it should be an interesting listen, and of course the Wire completists own it already."
5,The best of Texas,This is Manders best album by far. If you hear him in concert he will blow you away. This is a must buy if you are Texas Music fan.
5,One of the Greatest Rock Musicals Ever Written,"Make no mistake about it. This IS a rock musical. The overture, rousing end to the first act, the entre'act and the reprise. The elements are here but Tovey has turned the genre on its ear. More like the biting social commentary of A Threepenny Opera than Tommy, it is a harse indictment of Thatcherism and Britain at the time of the war in the Falkland Islands. Songs about unresponsive leaders, government induced unemployment and rabid, pointless jingoism mixed with the coolest industrial rhythms. Ambitious tale of the open festering wounds of industrialized England AND danceable. What more could you want!!"
5,Worth the read,Another Teri Blackstock goodie! This has a different twist from the beginning that is enjoyable. I am a Mary Higgins Clark fan and have found Teri Blackstock to be a comparable author and story teller. I especially appreciate her Christian perspective. It is not overwhelming but realistic about how real Christians live their lives. They are not super people who never have problems but real folks who deal with their problems through their faith in Christ.
5,Justifiable Means...awesome!,"I am a big fan of Terri Blackstock and she didn't let me down with this. As a continuation of Evidence of Mercy, she draws you in with her mysteries, love and what God is showing the characters through their trials. It left me eagerly waiting for the next edition."
5,Works Great With Both Treo 650 And Gateway Laptop,"I actually got this GPS in a bundle with the Mapopolis NavCard. It is very easy to use, and I found it to be very reliable. While I added it as a trusted device to my Treo, Mapopolis can't remember what GPS to use (minor issue that is not the fault of the GPS). It has great battery life - I've never used it for the 8 hrs advertised, but it is good for use around town. We used it exclusively while on vacation for 4 days. It acquires coordinates in under 1 minute from cold start. The beauty of this being a bluetooth device is that it can be used with multiple devices - Treo or laptop in my case. So if your device that receives the signal dies or gets lost, you still have a GPS building block left. I highly recommend it for the Treo if you get the Mapopolis bundle."
5,Just right,"Works as expected, buy both springs or you could be in trouble when the older one breaks while installing new one."
4,We liked this CD a lot,"I am more of a fan of Flamenco than Jazz...but we played this CD start to finish and were happily humming along. I wasn't the only one at home who enjoyed it at home, which tells me that ""Hypnotic Safari"" has a very broad appeal. The guitar is very clean and crisp, and the tunes are snappy or relaxingly mellow. Very enjoyable, and the term ""hypnotic"" really did describe the feeling.If you are a fan of Ottmar Liebert, you'd probably also like this particular CD from Wayne Wesley Johnson and Ruben Romero. The sound is very polished, and the cuts blend from one to the next smoothly. I found I could play this CD from start to finish without having to skip over the bits I didn't like."
2,Jazzawhat?,"With enough name-dropping for a few dozen records, the linernotes of this album describe Hypnotic Safari not as a safari of animalsbut of guitars. Not a great analogy, but for a guitar enthusiast this mightbe an intriguing album. Jazz guitarist Wayne Wesley Johnson hooks upwith New Age flamenco guitarist Ruben Romero to produce what Johnsoncalls ""jazzamenco"" - a name I hope he soon gives up on - but no matter,you get the picture. At its worst, this is good elevator music, and atits best, it's relaxing, jazzed-up flamenco."
2,Bad Design Throughout,Great set of games but the design is all wrong. The king's crowns don't fit or stay on the checker peices. All of the cards are worthless. There is only one number on the cards and it is on the wrong side. When you fan the cards out you can't see what cards you have. Makes the card games very hard to play. Having only one number on the cards makes the player rearrange the cards everytime you play. Very frustrating.
4,Excellent Product,My 4 year old daughter received this for her birthday and she loves it. It has been a fun way to introduce her to variety of games and we have fun with it. Great product for the price. The box is also great to keep it all in one place.
5,unconventional = great,"gorgeous, emotional, glitchy electronic music. this is the kind of music i wanted to hear but had never heard until i bought this album.see for yourself, listen to the samples."
1,Beware if you are buying this for Sony DSC-T9,"I have a brand new DSC-T9 and the Sony battery that came along with it works fine. I ordered this Maxell DC3636 as a backup battery. But alas, when I turn on the camera after inserting the charged Maxell battery, the camera rejected it saying it requires a 'InfoLithium' battery.In a nutshell, this battery does not work for DSC-T9. If anyone else knows of a generic battery, I would like to know as I do not wish to shell out $56 for the original Sony battery."
1,Presents the Moderate Right Against Only the Extreme Left,"This book would be better if he cowrote this with a truely Progressive thinker. Most Progressive thinkers (Democrats) are not extreme and have a variety of views. Most republicans would be offended if we presented Ann Coulter or KKK views as the typical Republican views. This in reverse is exactly what this author has done.I consider myself to be a Progressive thinker even though I was for Welfare Reform and am against abortion. My party is accepting of my differences more so it seems than republicans are of their members who may veer to the left on a few topics. This book is unbalanced, condescending, and arrogant."
1,hummm....,"So I read this book hoping to understand this perspective a bit better. I really was dissappointed, this book is full of the trite, baseless garbage that I feared it would be full of. I suggest you look elsewhere for insight into this perspective."
4,catchy song,"If you like Chers song Believe, you'll like this one too. Off course its not a new Theme from Mahogany, but still a catchy and easy modern song. Its good to hear that Diana is still around after all those years."
5,A tremendous contribution to everyone young and old.,"H. Steven Robertson takes us on a journey. For some, a journey revisited, for others one that was / is needed. There are manya written word about love, life, and triumph or tragedy. But, Ihave never seen it delivered in such a riveting way. This authorreaches you with his superb descriptive prose. The story line isnovel, but it takes you much further than just the growth of thelead character; it strikes to the heart of character in each of us. The book delivers to you a social fabric that once predominately existed in this country, genuine simple hard times.It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and invokes the reader's emotions. It warms your heart and touches your soul. I wish I were there again, and it is my goal to recapture as much of it as I can. This book is a tremendous contribution to everyone young and old. I hope they make a movie. I would give it 6 stars if I could."
5,"RANCH BOY--- MEMORIES, MEMORIES.","STEVE ROBERTSON HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DEPICTING THE(COMING OF AGE) IN CENTRAL FLORIDA DURING THE 50's AND 60's.AS A FORMER CLASSMATE AND TEAMMATE, I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITHSTEVE'S FIRST ATTEMPT AS AN AUTHOR. I WILL LOOK FORWARD TOA CONTINUATION OF ""ROBBIE DUNCAN'S"" LIFE. STEVE, KEEP UP THEGOOD WORK."
5,Old Florida Nostalgia,"First time author Steve Robertson has penned an intriguing, very accurate story of growing up in 1950's Central Florida. Written as a coming-of-age tale, it takes the reader from Robbie Duncan's first pangs of puppy love through the agonies of summer high school football training to a heart-stopping, breath-taking, gut-wrenching confrontation with a full ton of murderous Brahman bull gone wild. For those of us born and raised in the Florida of the 1950's, this Old Florid narrative will bring back the nostalgia of youth."
1,go somewhere else,"i got this from my local library and I am sooo glad i didn't pay for it. while it is a good resource of information and i'm certain the new edition contains updated material, I was really put off by the whole public schools/government/anyone in authority is of the DEVIL idea.while i acknowledge there is a definite Christian movement in homeschooling, to see a book so blatantly biased in the material, ideas, and reviews, really left a bad taste in my mouth. I want to homeschool or find an alternative form of education for my daughter because I don't like what's happening at my local public school district. Even though I am a Christian, this book made me feel like i was in a fringe group, that it wasn't addressed to me.It does have some good information in it, it also portrays the weird homeschooler stereotype that i think she's probably trying to avoid.Go somewhere else. go somewhere where each page doesn't drip with biases and heavily opinionated material masquerading as fact."
4,Lots of good information,"If you are starting out in homeschooling. It has lots of good information on getting started. It covers, just about everthing you need to know, or where to go to get the information you need."
3,"some good info, but closed-minded","I did really enjoy reading this book, overall. The author does seem to assume all of her readers are Conservative Christians, though. She takes an ""us vs them"" attitude here and there throughout the book. Also she seems to have a dim view of human-kind and implies a couple times that there is evil lurking everywhere. Despite that, I would recommend the book because it is quite informative in all other aspects and is entertaining and fun to read if you don't get too offended by her closed-minded comments."
2,Too much of nothing,"I've read several homeschooling books trying to suck up as much information as I can. What I've realized is that all these homeschooling authors seem like they are perfect mothers, wives, citizens. Just because I want to home school my kids doesn't mean I agree with of a lot of her ideals. Don't buy this book. Just try to borrow it from the library and just skim through it. It goes on and on about a lot of things that really don't matter. You'll have to fish for the stuff that really matters to you."
3,Very informative if you can get past the personal opinions,"Mary Pride offers a very informative guide, but it is marred by all the strongly held personal opinions. She states religion is very important to raising a moral child, and while this may well be true, she suggests strongly that her choice of religion is the only viable one. I got a little disgusted with the sermon and stopped reading. The Christian self-rightousness is what has driven many from the Bible based religion to gentler beliefs, and I feel it will also drive many people away from this book as well.But what I did read was highly imformative."
3,update needed,"This book seems to be a bit out of date now, reviewing curriculums that don't exist anymore and not covering some of the newer quality products. Still relevent info about homeschooling for newbees."
1,Better books available,"I bought this book based on the very high ratings it got from this website but I was disappointed by the content. The book is very long, very dull and based on one woman's point of view. It has a lot of very useful information and it is helpful but there are much better books available. While I was waiting for my order to arrive I checked out ""The Homeschooling Book of Answers : The 88 Most Important Questions Answered by Homeschooling's Most Respected Voices"" from my local library. This book has the same basic info but from many different viewpoints. The best part is it answered every one of my questions and some I hadn't thought of yet without having to sift through mountains of repetitive junk to get to it. I plan to donate my complete guide to our local homeschool lending library."
5,Sweeeeeeet!,"When I first opened this package, the first thing I thought was, ""Oh drats! Now I have to get a clip for this to mount to!""I searched here on Amazon and found Krusell actually has many styles of clip-ons. More frustration! I came here to see if there was info on what kind of clip adapter it needed, and found in the description that one was included.What??? I didn't see any clip!I looked again.Nope.I looked closer, and guess what? It was tucked INSIDE the case! WHEW!Hopefully, someone will read this and think, ""Ah! I do not need an adapter clip!""Have a great day, folks!"
3,Dummy Knob,"It's hard to rate a door know anything other than okay, afterall it is just a door knob. But it was a match for what I was trying to finish."
3,Great American singer; strange concept.,"The newly issued collection, ""Keely Smith: The Essential Capitol Recordings,"" is as essential as this one is expendable. ""Keely Swings Basie Style"" proves that her voice has held up over the past half century to a greater degree than practically any other jazz or pop singer who comes to mind. But the material comes off as tired and a bit stiff, and the attempt of Concord (or some clueless promoter) to ""sell"" it with some introductory and concluding hyped-up recorded announcements (more Howard Cosell than Ed Sullivan), comes off as camp, simply confirming the formulaic or contrived quality of the session. And whatever possessed her (perhaps that supremely wise promoter) to do Sinatra's patriotic hymn ""The House We Live In"" on an all-Basie program remains a mystery. Finally, appending ""With Strings"" to ""Basie Style"" all but swamps this clumsy beast. Basie may have style, but the same can hardly be said for Keely's production team."
3,Great episodes!,"I'm giving this Thomas video-cassette just three stars, not because the episodes are bad, but because the first episode, ""James Goes Buzz-Buzz"", seems to be a ltitle frightening to younger audiences. The scene when James gets stung on the nsoe seems to be a bit scary, especially when he screams and everything else! If you beleive that this episode is scary, cover your face when this sequence comes up!"
1,I am an OTA program director: This book is a SHAM.,"This book was ordered to show OTA students at Pearl River Community College. When delivered, I found that it is not a legitimate review manual. The material is substandard (very), it provides useless prep tips, it even prepares the OTA for an essay portion that does not exist. The exam questions are not in NBCOT format (eg. gives the choice ""all of the above"" which is not on the real exam) and finally, offers NO EXPLANATIONS for answers on ""practice exams"". AVOID this book."
3,"Product work fine, but defective","We ordered this set, but end up returned for replacement because of the 2 items were damaged. The new replacement set has few small dent on the items when arrive, but we are tire and didn't want to send them back again.*** The KitchenAid set work very well so far after a month. It release the cake easy compare to the one we bought at Walmart. We gave it 4 stars.Unfortunately, there are few defective items due to poor package. We gave it 1 star."
2,Damaged and Throwaway Bakeware in Box,"This Kitchenaid set arrived well-packed and tucked safely inside the box. However, when we unwrapped the individual pieces, there were several flaws that obviously (at least to us) were inflicted before they went into the box. The cookie sheet had dents in the bottom and a smaller impression alone one side, as did one of the cake pans. The second cake pan was scraped down through the coating on one lip - we were easily able to flake away a larger space around it. That one went immediately into the trash. We decided the hassle of return outweighed our considerations for buying this type of product from Kitchenaid again."
3,"Contrived, and sometimes compelling","Though the intentionally eccentric arrangements and instrumentation can become jarring, Pallett infuses his artsy constructs with enough songwriting backbone to justify some of the pretense and excess, occasionally hitting raw nerves you wish would occur more often."
1,pirate hat,"This hat was not what i expected. I found it at a party store for half the price. But i also had higher standers bc i was hoping that it was the hat that i had seen on a disney cruise, which was very nice, and in the pic. this hat looked like that one, but wasnt."
1,Do not waste your money,"Okay, first of all this hat is NOT the one in the picture. Notice the size in the picture? This hat is at least 1/2 of that size. Notice the color? This hat is a dull brown. The hat this company ships is really an Australian outback hat with some braids sewn into the back. The hat in the picture is, without a doubt, not the same one this company ships - but the tag on the hat states it is a Deluxe hat with beaded braids - and I guess it is - an Aussie Outback hat with beaded braids. If you are looking for a pirate hat, look somewhere else."
2,Not Great,The hat is not as large as it looks in the photo and it is much floppier. I am disappointed in this purchase.
2,Weak Capt. Jack Hat,"This hat is pretty weak, especially for the price! I had to do major altering, coloring, stitching, gluing, and still took it off half way through the night. I cut off the hair and scarf and added it to my scarf/wig that does not come with a hat. The hair was actually good, but not much of it there, and the scarf was a great color and accompanied the rest of my costume well. i wouldn't have been able to wear just this without major changes and been a successful pirate, let alone Capt. Jack Sparrow!"
4,This game is fun until....,"This is a well-made game that allows people to participate in an aspect of African culture. The board and metal container are sturdy and the game pieces are attractive. My only complaint is that there are no extra game pieces in case a piece or two get lost. Using dried beans or buttons will result in a less attractive game, which is unfortunate, since the maker of the game clearly took its visual appeal into consideration."
3,Not bad for the money,"This is a easy game to learn. It might take a little more to learn strategy, but that's the ""learning"" part. The only problem we had with the delivery was that one of the stones was cracked in half. I was able to super glue it back together. It would be nice if they were packed more secure and maybe sent 2 or 3 extra."
5,Outstanding,Lee Strobel is an outstanding author addressing an excellent topic in a refreshing relevant manner. You will truly enjoy it. Great got a small group st ut as well.
5,Far from the Maddening Crowd,"When the hustle and bustle of modern life has you totally frazzled reach for any of Jeanine McMullen's books and slow down. Her descriptions of life on a small farm in Wales are not only delightful but a real hoot. Who would have thought a horse named Doli could create such pandominium? And her little whippet, Merlin; you will never forget some of the stunts he pulls. The goat Little Nana (black-hearted rebel that she is) is also always causing one sort of trouble after another. I just wish Jeanine had written more than three books about her life in Wales."
1,Are you kidding me? No handle!,Is there any reason I should not expect a handle to be included in this package? Am I supposed to buy one? This is going back.
5,November 24 review below has it ALL WRONG!,"First and foremost, let me say that this is a **GREAT** book! I don't know who that guy (or gal) is that blasted this book on November 24th, but I'd bet that s/he hasn't even read it and obviously doesn't understand the target audience--people like me who want to learn how to program using VB.Net. This book is one of the clearest books about VB.Net that I have found. I own 3 other VB.Net books and I wish I had found this one first."
1,Plastic -- It Broke in Less Than Two Months,"Since the product description doesn't specify, this is a plastic door handle. The product description also calls it ""sturdy"" and states it ""stand(s) up to severe weather conditions and years of handling."" What I got was a plastic door handle that broke in roughly 50 days. A company called CJ Pony Parts sells a metal version of this door handle that costs less ($10.55) and they currently offer free shipping on all orders. That's what I bought to replace this product."
2,A slow lingering death...,"This book is not only about a slow lingering death, it felt like a slow lingering death. I almost stopped reading it halfway through because it was so talky and very little happened. Worse, the main character was annoying and not very likable or believable, just whiney. I bought this book because I enjoyed Katrina Kittle's ""The Kindness of Strangers"", but this book didn't come close. This entire book could have been written as a short story. Maybe it's just me, but the subject matter seemed dated and less relevant to people's current attitudes. Can't say I'd recommend this one. Skip it."
4,Lessons in Letting Go,"Summer is a former ballet dancer who is determined to make her mark in life. When she watches Jacob, her brother's lover, on stage, she thinks that she ought to be in the limelight, basking in applause.Summer's desires to excel and prove herself become all the more pressing because she wants to accomplish this while her brother, who is dying of AIDS, is still alive to see her bloom. Her brother, though, loves her as she is, and wonders why she just doesn't ""get it.""This book is about many weighty subjects, among them coming to terms with living an ordinary life, a life in which one's greatest deeds are done privately, quietly, without fanfare and applause.It is also about the important work of letting go of grudges, hatred and pride.There are times when this book is too heavy-handed and preachy. It has many messages to convey, perhaps too many. But the writing and characters shine through."
4,A wonderful eye opening book.,"I loved every minute this book. I feel a little lighter in the heart for reading this book. It answered some unanswered, unasked questions.I would highly suggest this book to anyone. It wasn't a heavy read but it was thought provoking. In a way it makes you look at life differently.It also gets a slot in my Top Ten List for the way it makes me feel and what it changed inside of me. This is one of those books that changes someone's life even if in the smallest way."
4,Good Book,"Here we are, reading a book about a very discriminatory topic: gay relationships. Yet, I felt when reading this book, if only heterosexual love could always be this fulfilling and deep. Todd and Jacob definitely got the idea of commitment and love RIGHT in this book. We should all do as well. While I (a heterosexual) have no bias whatsoever to the gay lifestyle, I hold optimism, through this book, that those struggling with acceptance of this issue will find their answers here. The only part of the book I didn't really care for was Summer's extremely long lasting confusion about Nicholas. I loved the quotes throughout the book. 'Think I will write some of those down to pass along to others. Many were very inspirational. Good job on this book."
1,MONT SAINT MICHEL travel DVD,The particular DVD is average quality at best and less than 30 nimutes long. I should return it.
4,A good course,"For anyone in prehospital medicine, a good course to take. I found a lot of it to be review from my Paramedic class, though."
2,Lay off the basics.,This is supposed to be an advanced book. If I was looking to learn how to put on a c-collar or a KED I'll buy the BTLS book and take that class. This is supposed to be part of an EMT-P curriculum. If a paramedic student does not know these things they should be looking elsewhere for a career. Take the space given for these basic skills and put in some realavent information for advanced providers. Keep this topic interesting and challenging instead of wasting time with basic first-aid and first responders skills. We know this stuff! Now we want more! Everything aside from the waste of time and paper on the basics is actually really great information. I just want more of it.
1,Fraud,"The heading for this film says:Starring: Peter Palmer, Leslie ParrishIt is also on the cover, showing their names.But it is a B/W copy of a much older version with Jeff York and Martha Driscoll."
2,Beware of cover art!,"This is the 1940 RKO production (the print is an Astor Pictures reissue) starring Granville Owen as Abner and Martha O'Driscoll as Daisy Mae. But the cover art identifies the stars as Peter Palmer and Leslie Parrish, who actually headlined the superior 1959 musical adaptation. The back cover gets the cast right, but they list the running time as 114 minutes (!) instead of the correct 73. This oddball movie is peppered with a host of silent screen comedians: Buster Keaton, Edgar Kennedy, Bud Jamison (unrecognizable behind makeup), Al St. John, Hank Mann, Chester Conklin, Mickey Daniels...which makes the whole enterprise seem even more disappointing. Still, it's a novelty for film buffs...what the heck, I already have BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA, which is also available in nice shape from Digiview."
3,Amazon DVD,"The DVD was in good condition, but I wanted the L'il Abner that I knew. This one was a weird version.....not what I expected. So it's not the person's fault."
5,well ok,this is probobly the first deck i would get(i did). it has a couple good magic cards like monster reborn sword of dark destruction ext. the onily worth wile card is summond skull because it has the same atk as dark magician and needs 1 sacrifice(dark magician needs 2).so I have hade this deck a while and won 2 duels then got my kiba evolution i win every thime againsed my neighbor.so dont get it if you want a kick a**deck
3,COULD GET A BETTER DECK!,"If you are planning on getting a good deck then do not waste your time with this..it has the essentials, sure, but your money is better spent at one of the 4 ""STRUCTURE DECKS""!! They are much better than this..I can say so beacuse my sis owns this deck and I can beat her every time :) Konami needs to put some better stuff in this deck - like Senju of the Thousand Hands X 2. Also they need to take away the change of heart since it's ""advanced"" forbidden. but still, this deck deserves an OK rating since it has all the essentials..this is no better than the first yugi starter deck. So if you ALREADY have a starter deck, do not get this as it is not worth it - a lot of weak non effect monsters.."
3,Starter Yugi,"I love this cards however, I thought all cards of yugi are all here as my son also expected....However its all fine."
4,Good starter deck.,"This deck includes 1 ritual monster and a Dark magician.Other than that they are all common cards. However they aren't bad to have if you are just playing with your friends.You also get a duel paper thing where you can place your cards. It's more fn when you have those kind of things right? That's what I thought.I would buy these cards if you are a beginner with Yu-gi-oh. If you are more advanced, you should just get good booster packs."
3,People.. only a card?,"This deck is better than Kaiba's. People usually only buy Kaiba's deck for the Blue Eyes.. but if you want it so bad, buy it seperate. Yugi's deck actually has a strategy set in in. It's got an assorted variety off all types of cards, and no, I'm not only saying this because it's got a stupid axe of despair and a Black Luster Soldier, but because it's a strategic deck that's been put together for us to buy. But don't try using this in tournaments because most people know this deck like the back of their head. Wait, do people know what the back of their head looks like? Hang on, wait a moment while I try andd see the back of my head.. =D"
2,I DONT THINK THIS IS A GOOD DECK BUT ONLY FOR BEGINNERS,i think this is a load of time wasted for advanced duelists like me so i would suggest getting ioc booster packs cause i got black luster soilder envoy of the begginnning in 4 packs and its way better than the normal bls cause it can attack twice in a turn so if ur a begginner get this cause its a good deck for u
3,No review--just a question,"My 6-year-old daughter asked for these cards for Christmas but I have NO IDEA what this game is about. This is actually a relief from all the pricess junk she has been asking for for the past three years, but can someone tell me what this game is about?"
5,awesome starter deck!!!,"This is probably the best starter deck in the series! This deck has some very good cards in it , like swords of revealing light (stops opponent from attacking for 3 turns!), pot of greed (you get to draw 2 cards from your deck!), axe of despair (increase the attack of 1 monster by 1000 points!!) spellbinding circle (choose 1 monster on the field and it can't attack!) and raigeki break (discard 1 card from your hand to destroy 1 card on the field!!) The rares in this deck are Black Luster Soldier (3000 attack ritual monster), Black Luster ritual (summons Black Luster Soldier), and the long lasting, ever popular, Dark Magician (do I really need to say his stats?) I hope this helped you decide which starter deck you want to buy. So, buy a yugi evolution starter deck right now!"
4,Best if you upgrade and take some Cards out,"This deck is good as a STARTER DECK, not a deck that you never upgrade. I've used this deck against my friend and i lost in like, 2 turns! Even though he won 11 Tournaments, this deck didn't even beat my little brother! I'd Suggest that if you get this deck, buy some boster packs because once I did what was said in the title(my title) I even won to my friend! Anyways, this deck is BEST AS A STARTER DECK NOT A NON-UPGRADE DECK."
5,Death 'n' Roll Is Back!!,"BUY THIS CD!! This record is even better than ""Morning Star"". You will not be disappointed."
2,abyss studio next please!,"I over anticipated this cd expecting a continuation of ""Morning Star"", and was really let down. The first problem with ""Inferno"" is the guitar sound. The patented Entombed tube-crunch has been replace by a weak, barely distorted, Fender Telecaster sounding rock blunder. Next, the production is their worst yet. The vocals are the only part of the mix that sound half-descent. Everything else sounds dry and hollow. The songwiting is fair, but rarely agressive. Guys, do me a favor a get a hold of Peter and book Abyss studio for your next offering and try to redeem yourselves."
3,Good release marred by crap production,"This isn't death metal by any stretch of the imagination, rather it's ballsy, and grooving stoner metal. The lyrics are in general ironic or humorous, the songs ain't bad either being mostly slowly grooving slabs of distortion, not that there aren't some fast songs. But I couldn't give this any more than three stars because the production is muddy, bass heavy, unclear and ruins what could have otherwise been a very strong release. It sounds like demos rather than a finished product and the band sounds sloppy for it. As other reviewers have stated you'll be messing with your EQ in order to get a good sound, but dammit you shouldn't have to."
5,OUTSTANDING!!! a must for everyone,"This is such a wonderful single.""goodbye's (the saddest word) is a moving song.""All because of you"" this song is awesome I loved it and couldn't stop playing the song over and over again.""You shook me all night long"" she sings this with Anastacia this is also on the DVD ""Divas in Las Vegas"" featuring Cher,Shakira,Celine Dion,Anastacia.""Blue Christmas"" it's not my favourite but it's o.k""goodbye's (the saddest word)"" (video)this video is from the A new day has come concert at the Kodak Theatre.this is a great single even if you aren't a fan.you won't regret buying it."
2,A Good Start but Disappointing,"Max Conquers the Cosmos, Mark Bouton's first novel, was a disappointment for me. The former FBI agent, turned author, has an interesting story line; one I am sure that mirrors his many experiences at the Bureau. However, I found the novel lacked the character development and suspense that I have come to expect the Grisham, Patterson, Martini or Cornwell."
5,Awesome movie,"My favorite of the Living Dead movies. Punk rocker zombies, yes! Totally worth watching and buying. A zombie lover classic."
5,"Thrilling, Sexy & Enchanting!","Having adored the movie ""Gods and Monsters"", I was afraid this book would pale in comparison. Not at all! If anything, the book is even more compelling than the movie. The characters are richer, deeper; they get under your skin and stay there. Bravo, Mr. Bram!"
5,A deliciously complex masterpiece of speculative fiction,"Bram brilliantly creates a sense of place, time, and states of mind, as he weaves a piece of luminous fiction that is spookily believable and profound. Time in this work is a fluid commodity, ranging from the 1950's to the turn of the century, reflecting the dreamy fugues produced by James Whale's stroke-affected brain, where memory has gone berserk. Nota Bene: Hollywood in the 30's has never been so beautifully captured in all its marzipan unreality as in this novel. Not incidentially, Bram's creation of Clayton Boone is a stunning achievement (just as Frankenstein is Whale's stunning achievement)--we explore the dark glass from inside and out, with all the foreboding, humor, and compassion that Whale put into his horror films. This work is a marvel and not to be missed! Just as a side note: Bram's use of the present tense in this slippery time travel is nothing short of a technical tour de force."
2,Peaks and Valleys.,"Anything that came from the latter 2 albums are what drag this collection down. Even the most ardent fan would have to say that as well. Had they just stuck with one token song from Endangered Species(all good things) and maybe three songs from Magentalane(Magentalane,Mrs Toad Bake Some Cookies,and Mengentalane reprise)I feel it would have done them justice to call it Peaks."
4,SKSing,Great little book in all that you need to know about working on a SKS. It was very helpful for me to learn what I need to take apart and clean my gun.
5,"Emotions Anonymous, Revised Edition","I was very happy with my transaction. this book is in good shape, and order came in timely manner thank you"
3,Be careful with the drawer handles,"This is a very nice sturdy desk but...the handles are attached on the inside of the drawers during transit. They are also over tightened and the screws are cheap. The screw was so stripped, my husband had to drill it out, which wrecked the screw and he had to find another screw to fit. It's a shame that such a nice piece has such avoidable issues with assembly. We bought six pieces of the Powell Monster Bedroom furniture and had assembly issues with five of them."
4,A grea t read !,"This book is totally on track and is actually fun to read. It clearly helps focus on the issues and promotes some new ideas that are current and invaluable. After 12 years in sales, it made me think about certain aspects differently. To top it off, its a fun approach !I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Exercise Bands for P90X,"I both these bands for the exercises Im doing for P90X (A really good exercise program... I'll say the best exercise program ever!)And the light bands are not really strong. The only bands that I used are the medium, heavy, and very heavy. The very heavy band does work for many exercises. I do recomend this products and P90X."
5,One of the best Brit war movies !,"Excellent bio drama of Lt ""Lester ""Buster"" Crabb RN who mysteriously disappeard while on a mission examining a Russian Warship hull after war.Great transfer to DVD print, crisp clear and excellent supporting cast including Michael Craig and Sid James.Underwater scenes filmed in Malta are great. In Michael Craigs recommended autobiography ""The Smallest Giant"" he mentions this filmand the excellent relationship during filming with Laurence Harvey.One of the best Brit War Movies. Recommended!"
4,Good movie for a British flick,"Pretty good action scenes. I have read about Lt, Crap and he was a real hero. Why do they always have to put a women in these movies. She added nothing."
3,A lackluster WWII tale,"*The Silent Enemy"", made in 1958, is a slow-moving, sometimes frivolous account of a team of British frog drivers in Gibraltar during World War II. This is nowhere nearly as interesting as the classic war movies that came out of Britain during and shortly after the war. Special effects are sub-par and the story is rambling, but Harvey is good as the lead actor."
4,Very good war picture,"This time the theme is undersea warfare and conducted at Gilbralta, largely between the British (of course) and Italian navy divers stationed in Fascist Spain. Laurence Harvey here in early outing is very good, almost unexpectedly for I have often found his acting a bit annoying.This is the story of early career of Commander Crabbe, British undersea diver and war hero that disappeared carrying intelligence mission against Soviet naval vessel in British waters in the 1960s at height of Cold War. I remember later seeing a book that claimed Crabbe had been caught and instead of accepting his execution by the Soviets as a spy turned and worked for the Soviets in Russia. I have no idea whether any of this is true or false?"
1,Couldn't understand one word.,Neither my wife nor I could understand anything they were saying. Audio is AWFUL. We turned it off and wasted our money.
