1,overrated,Overrated band with crappy garage sound. People will listen to anything as long as it is critically acclaimed. Junk!
1,PLEASE!,"So very not good. So very Bad. If you love rock and really want to hear the next BIG THING, check out the American release of ""Razorblade Romance"" by HIM. You'll throw this album out, I promise."
1,For hardcore fans only,You must be a devoted follower to like this album. I can't understand how the same band can make Seven Nation Army - an excellent song - and combine it with 13 extremely bad pieces. It wasn't worth the money to buy this CD just for the one good song.
3,"Cool, yet Unoriginal","Perhaps my opinion may differ greatly to others, but I feel as though these supposed 'hip' bands of today (e.g. The White Stripes and The Strokes) are overtly trying to emulate bands of the 1960's and 1980's ( the former and latter, respectively -- is it just me but do the WS sound like The Doors?!). I have to admit that I am entertained by them, but I just find them strikingly unoriginal, and in some cases, a little bland. On the positive side, The WS's 'Seven Nation Army' has a truely infectious beat to it- which is what brought me to their attention, plus it evokes a certain nostalgia of 1960's rock. All in all, The White Stripes ARE an interesting group..."
3,Not as good as people say...,"...but still better than the usual crap we get nowadays. It's somewhat recomforting to know that at least some groups are going back to the blues/metal of the 60s & 70s (namely Led Zep). However, The White Stripes still have a lot of room to improve, namely on drums and guitar (their backbone I'd say). Nonetheless, give it a try, you might like it. But by no means try to compare Jack White to Robert Plant, please."
5,Finnaly some real Rock Music,"People often criticize this band for sounding too old school. But I think it was time we finnally had a band that actually was true rock and roll. They definetly have the most original sound in the last 20 years. This group is one that you will probaly either really love or absolutely hate. Their new album ""Elephant"" is just another progression to excellence for the White Stripes. As usual with the White Stripes this album as many diffrent styles of rock on it. Everything from slow rock with Meg White's ""Cold Cold Night"" to some more hardcore rock with ""Little Acorn"" and ""Hypnotize"". They also have some awesome songs that lay in between these two very diffrent rock styles. For example their first single off this album ""Seven Nation Army"" offers a very nice feel with the bass. I think if you want a album that offers some true rock and roll music and great lyrics then Elephant should be it. Also I highly recommend any White Stripe album."
1,Blah.,"God, I hate these guys. Hearing them play live on the Grammys was enough to make anyone sick. Their last album stunk and this one is a repeat..why bother? Please..just disappear guys."
1,Thank Goodness they're finished,I remember a few years ago people were all talking about this band.Thank goodness they won't be putting out anymore music (hopefully)BORING [...]
1,OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have seen this guy with Loretta Lynn on tv for about a month.I have heard one song on the radio I said to myself maybe I just have to hear the whole CD. Well I heard on TV this guy is the greatest thing since toilet paper on guitars. Boy they were close he belongs on TP. This music has all been done before & it sucked then too.
1,The latest fraud...,"This dog and pony show breathes new life into P.T. Barnum's observation that ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Would it be too much to ask that they transfer a little coin from their obviously lavish wardrobe budget into music lessons? A metronome, perhaps.Grade school kids play better than this, but I suppose that's one more reason to love them in the minds of their faithful."
1,PATHETIC,"I'm listening to this album now. I would have rate 2 or 3 stars because it is simply another piece of mediocre pseudo-rawness, tolerable however. But just now I heard this song named ""The Air Near My Fingers"" and I repeated it for three times and I got this conclusion.THIS SINGLE SONG (MOSTLY ITS INTRO) IS THE MOST PATHETIC, CHEAP, SHAMELESS, RETARDED, WANNABE, INSULTING NIRVANA-RIP-OFF I'VE HEARD IN MY LIFE. JACK WHITE DON'T TELL ME YOU NEVER HEARD ""RAPE ME"".So, what I am doing here is rating one star(seems too high) because I witnessed an awful robbery."
2,Poor to average,"These guys are doing nothing new, and Jack's vocals really do NOT sound anything like some previous comparisons to Robert Plant. 'Theres no home for you here girl' has near enough the same riff as 'Dead Leaves'Conclusion - if you think this rocks, get educated and by some Zepp, Stones, Beatles"
3,"not bad , but - not too much new here either","this is another good release from the white stripes but there isn't much here that we haven't already heard before. some of the songs sound like alternate versions or b-sides from white blood cells. again this is a good release well worth picking up, but with the exception of a few tracks, you wont hear anything you haven't heard before."
5,Amazing.,"The album is amazing. Regarding one of the earlier reviews, there is no bass on the album. Everyone should read the interview with them in Mojo magazine it's a very insightful look into the album. Discussing the meaning's behind the songs and also the recording of them. ""There's No Home for you Here"" is my favorite song on the album at the moment, but the whole thing is a masterpiece. Anyone that says this doesn't live up to their earlier work should have their head checked. **Just to Clarify to anyone that might be reading this, NO Bass on the album. I've been looking at other reviews and people are like ""wow the first thing you hear is bass"" this is not true. People should think before they decide to write something."
2,Leave the high notes to Dusty Springfield,"What is it with this band? Which is more annoying--Meg's Ronettes' look (Ronnie Spector did it better) and leaden drumming or Jack's straining (screeching) to reach the high notes on ""I just don't know what to do with myself""(thud-da-dud)? After reading so many positive reviews, I have tried to like them, but find them just terribly affected. Leave the blues numbers to musicians with more soul, and Meg--please take some drum lessons."
5,edgy and different,"I love white strippes for it different sound and how strange they are. ex husband and wife become brother and sister. hmmmmmmmmmm weirdo, but they artiest."
2,Too Much Cymbals,"Confession: I never listened to the full album, only because I can't. Don't get me wrong the song writing is good and the singing and guitars are fine but it's the drums. The drummer seriously needs a drumming lesson. She hit the cymbals way too much it sounded like a 3-year old was playing. That ruined the album for me and I just can't listen to it from start to finish."
5,Good CD,"This CD is truely amazing. The guitar on it that Jack displays is a work of art that is unmatched in any other White Stripes CD.The drumming work that Meg does adds to the beats of Jack,and has its own uniquness.Meg also has a wonderfull voice.This CD,Elephant,has some country beats,and stupendous lyircs that I can say with confidence are some of the best."
4,Elephant: Decent Album,"The White Stripes are an interesting band. Meg White may [stink] at singing, but hey, that doesn't bother me. I think Jack is a great guitar player. It's not how simple it is, or how difficult it is either. It's the quality that makes this album outstanding. I remember watching the band perform each day of one week on Conan O'Brien. Jack can really play a mean guitar. I know and understand much about music, and their styles are different. This is a must own album for any rock n roll fan. Jack and Meg's styles have made this band sound different and unique. Not any other music group can be compared to them.My favorite songs include Seven Nation Army, Ball and Biscuit, and Hypnotize. There is a mix of slow songs, fast songs, and just plain ole rock! Meg sings in the song, ""In the Cold, Cold, Night"". It's not the best, but its fun to listen to. The last song, ""Well It's True That We Love One Another"" , is a great song that reminds me of the Mama's and the Papa's...."
4,This is Rock,"Being the first White Stripes album I buy, but having heard White Blood Cells, I can honestly say that the second one is better. But not THAT better. Elephant is one of the releases of the year simply because of the consistency of a great bunch of songs: Seven Nation Army has classic written all over it, as There's not home for you here, You've got her in your pocket or I don't know what to do with myself. Unfortunately the tracklisting department fails considerably: all of the previously mentioned songs, along with other great tunes such as Black math, or Ball and biscuit, are all put together in the first half of the record. Hence, the second part of the cd is good but doesn't shine whatsoever. White Blood Cells is brilliant from start to end. I would buy this record first, because it's amazing, and then, when I think no group can have another great cd, I'd buy White... and die of happiness."
4,The White Stripes dish out a quality CD,"This CD is full of many different types of songs, some sound classic,some slow, some modern rock and others popish. I personally like most people was drawn in by thier hit: Seven Nation Army, then I thought a lot about this CD. At first, I read the booklet and thought they were some christian band and wanted to refund the CD. Then, I liked the CD and then thought it to be a good indie album. My favorite songs are the first 3 and I also like Ball and Biscuit. This is a great CD, but I would STRONGLY RECOMEND YOU LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE YOU BUY IT ..."
5,I Love this CD!!,"From the first song Seven Nation Army to the last one with Holly GoLightlythis is one of the best cd's I've heard! I like this one better than Get behind me satan but that one has some really great songs on it but yougotta love Meg singing In the cold,cold night. And Black Math..Whew!I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
4,"live it, love it, listen to it","They rock live! Planned or not, Jack's tight white pants were transparent by the end of the night...god bless texas heat. They pulled off back to back shows with just a few hours in between to rest, shower and and give it their everything all over again. Well done! There was no holding back. Meg was wonderful and even though Jack referred to her as his ""sister"", I know those two have something else going on..... crowd pleasers were Ball and Biscuit, I Fought Piranhas and and There's No Home For You Here. The first attempt at Seven Nation Army bombed , and they gave up claiming the guitar was out of tune....SUUUUURE. It was just plain awful. They tried it again and did it justice during their encore but could have easily left it out entirely and everyone would have still walked away totally satisfied!"
4,Interesting Look into Christian Mysticism and Orthodoxy,Interesting read for anyone that wants to learn more about Christian Spirituality and Mysticism
2,I don't know why everyone gave it such high marks,"If you want a DVD that shows a large man (who's shoulders roll forward from bad posture)giving a tan woman a really nice massage, then this is the DVD for you.It doesn't really give any instruction. I should have only paid about $20 for this so I feel pretty ripped off.If this is a 4-5 star DVD then I am in for huge disappointments with other massage DVDs."
5,Good video,This is a good instructional video. I have not watched it all but have learned quite a bit.
4,James Joyce's Bizarre Step-Child,"Mccabe's sing-song writing style (hard to create and pleasing to the eye) is opposite to the the dreary depressing material, he is one of the most creative users of the spontaneous stream-of-consciousness techniques, helping the reader enter the head of two characters, slowly descending into madness and mental illness, through complex opposites. There are a few moments early on in the novel of such expressed beauty and happiness for both characters and their significant others, it makes the endings even more devestating. Joyce would be proud of McCabe's seductively warped stream-of-consciousness"
4,Brilliant and wicked,"McCabe is one of the most introspective and naughty young novelists to hit the shelves this decade. His faculty with the third-person limited point of view is worth the price of admission. He inhabits these characters, who become unforgettable for their anachronistic manias and sensitivities. They are at once utterly recognizable and thankfully foreign. McCabe's wit is punchy and searing. This novelist is a cynic at first glance, but the slow transformation of his characters puts the lie to this; McCabe will not let go of the possibility of redemption for even the most debased. He is Irish after all."
1,One bad motor and one is noisy in high speed,Purchased two fans. One has bad motor which just hums and the blades don't spin. Have to pay the electrician installing and uninstalling fee for the bad fan. The other one is noisy in high speed. Low speed is very slow. Don't buy!!
5,Indispensable resource,"This is a well researched collection of maps and general Mennonite history, useful for historians and family researchers alike. I had delayed purchasing the Atlas for years. Now that I have finally bought it, I can't believe I did not acquire it sooner. The major locations and migrations of the Mennonites are presented clearly and concisely. I recommend it as a general resource to anyone who is interested in the topic."
1,False Advertising,The photo shows princess Jasmine but the product we received did not have Jasmine at all. Jasmine was the only reason we ordered these as our daughter is obsessed with her and specifically told Santa she wanted Jasmine big girl panties. She was disappointed when Santa did not leave her any Jasmine panties.
5,IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH,THIS BOOK IS TRULY A BLESSING TO THE BODY OF CHRIST.FUCHSIA PICKETT AND THE HOLYGHOST TAKES YOU NOT ONLY TO THE MIND OF THE FATHER BUT TO THE HEART OF THE FATHER. THIS BOOK IS FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST WHO LOVES TO SAT AT THE FEET OF JESUS WITH THERE WORSHIP. THIS BOOK WILL NOT ONLY OPEN YOUR MINDS TO THE THINGS OF GOD. BUT YOU WILL FIND THE NEEDFUL THING AND THAT NEEDFUL THING IS TO WORSHIP THE LORD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH. THIS BOOK ALONE WITH THE HOLYGHOST WILL TAKE YOU TO A PLACE IN GOD LIKE NEVER BEFORE. ARE YOU READY TO GO TO A PLACE IN GOD CALLED THERE . SO BE READY TO BREAK OPEN YOUR ALABASTER BOX.
4,Powerful,"The standout of this album is ""Don't want to know if you are lonely"" which is truly the greatest song ever written about a break-up. It is haunting, snarling, spewing frustration and anger, yet has a great melody. It is as concentrated a rock song as any that has ever been performed and it ends exactly when it should, not an half second too long. If you have ever been dumped by a girl/boyfriend, listen to this song.The remaining songs are not the equal of ""Don't want to know"" but are still quite good. They reflect a lot of pent up emotion and have good tunes.This is the album that Nirvana wishes it could have made. 4 1/2 stars."
4,Heerlijk,"Heerlijke stevige nummers met een aantal hoogtepunten. Vooral de nummers 4, 6, 8 (vooral deze !) en 13 gaan er elke avond weer in. Ik ben blij dat ik deze cd heb kunnen bemachtigen. Kopen !"
3,Good Debut Novel,I truly enjoyed this book with supposed best friends Sinclair and Aliette. This novel held me hostage from the first page until about the middle where it seems as if the author gets tired and doesn't keep up with the storyline and the story seems to fall apart. The secondary characters wer introduced but they fizzle out as well. I would still recommend this book but I think the author can do a better job. I am waiting for her next book Rockin'Robin to see if she does better.
3,She Got Issues,"This chic really had issues. The book was okay. Sinclair divorces her husband after she finds out he's had an affair with 2 women. Alliette, is the ex wife of one of the men Sinclair has had an affair with. Alliette becomes Sinclair's best friend to plot revenge against her. This book has it's laugh's and juice."
2,I DID TRY MY BEST 2 LIKE IT!!!,"The story line for this book is GREAT, the book had so much potential, thats why it was a big disappointment for me when this book turn out to be boring!!.In general the book was very weak, i did try and read it but at page 142 i just had enough."
1,Issues With This Book,"I am so sick and tired of reading books that turn out to be real let-downs!!!Does any author really know how to write a good book nowadays?Not once does Stephanie Johson bother to go into great deal about her ""round"" characters facial descriptions, but the character Mia who is considered a ""flat"" character gets a full-description of her beautiful features? But why? Mia is not relevant to the overall plot in the book. So, why waste time, writing/focusing on her character?Help me, I'm really confused???As a matter-of-fact the book does not even start off very well. I was reading the first couple of chapters shaking my head."
2,Why so many high reveiws?,"The cover of this book is misleading. I thought I would be reading about a lady or man with issues in the bedroom or something to that affect, not about a lady obsessed with another lady for cheating with her man. This book was written poorly. The characters were just thrown together. I can't tell you what ONE of the characters looked like. I had no favorites, which is what killed it for me. Every book read should leave some time of thought with the reader. This one just didn't do anything for me. Sorry Miss Johnson."
5,I Can Testify,"I read She's Got Issues inside of one day. Aliette was coniving, deceitful and selfish. Sinclair was hurt, vulnerable and forgiving. The story behind these two women taught me that we as women have no idea what supressing our feelings can do. It turns us into people who we generally are not. Our emotions take over and force us to do things that we know aren't right. This was the case with Sinclair. She thought by divorcing Vernon, she had dealt with the hurt he'd subjected her to. It wasn't until she met the tramp, Aliette, that she realized that she had unfinished business with the issue of being cheated on.Once Sinclair had gotten Aliette to hit rock bottom by giving Wayne, Aliette's fiance, the goods on his trifling woman, she was able to get over it, finally.She's Got Issues is a great book and is a must read!"
2,Wolf's Rite,"I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. The main character of this book was one of the most selfish people that anyone would ever encounter. He's nobody's friend, although others have tried to be a friend to him. The book moves too slow and my patience ran out!"
3,Main Character was a jerk,The book was interesting but the main character was such a jerk I found it hard to like him enough to like the book.
1,Do NOT Eat,"I foolishly picked these up without reading the label carefully enough. After three days of eating a few before bed, I had excruciating pain in my jaw. I finally realized the cause when I read the ingredients and saw that they contain arsenic. I know some people like homeopathic remedies, but I'm not putting arsenic in my body. It felt like someone was stabbing my jaw with needles. These are simply Not Safe!"
2,Map and We're still lost!,First off if you want to know where big roads are in Hong Kong and like to stand out like a sore thumb with a huge map then this is a great map for you.I found that the map didnt list any of the smaller streets. Was very big length wise and kind of a pain to use.I picked up a tourist map at the info booth and it had everything that i needed. Even the small streets!!
1,very disappointing,"The cover of this map has the nerve to use the word ""extensive."" Ha! This map is seriously lacking in detail. The fold-out maps inside the ""Top 10 Hong Kong"" book I ordered were *much* more detailed. I don't think I will even bother taking this with me to HK. A huge waste of money."
1,Binding Fell Apart Immediately,"I purchased three copies of this book to give away at a children's event at my library. When I opened the front covers of each of them, the covers ripped away from the pages. This can happen to books over years of use, but should never happen with a brand new book. The pages must have been improperly glued to the cover. This is shoddy bookmaking and a real disappointment. Since all three copies of this book had problems with the binding, there is probably something wrong with the bulk of Amazon's copies. Therefore I would urge parents thinking about buying this for Christmas to go to a brick and mortar bookstore to make sure they're getting a well made book."
4,go grinch,"this book rocks. i have recently seen the grinch movie, but the book was way better. i do not think it is scary. however little kids might think that the grinch was real. i know my little sister did."
5,Good as a book,"Don't forget, before there was that good cartoon film version, there was this book. It has its own unique artistic feel, rather different from the the film, though the text is basically the same. This was one of my favorite books as a kid; I would read it no matter what time of year it was! Perhaps Seuss's best, along with ""Green Eggs and Ham."""
5,Used How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"The book came at a timely fashion and it was in the shape I assumed it would be since it was used,"
2,Not that impressed,I got the book and the second time I opened it the binding fell apart. The book totally seperated from the cover. It feels like a waste of money. The story is fantastic though.
5,Book for Christmas reading!,Great Christmas story book. My classroom kids love this story. So glad I could get in time for Christmas for them.
3,Wrong item,"The book arrived and it was in good shape. The problem is that I meant to order Dr. Seuss's actual book, not the adaptation of the movie. This item is NOT the original ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" written by Dr. Seuss. It is an adaptation of Jim Carrey's movie."
3,A Little Disappointed!,"I love the words to this story but I must confess that I was a little disappointed by the illustrations because they are mostly black and white. I guess I'm just used to the cartoon version of this story which is very colorful! I bought other Dr. Seuss books that I liked a lot more.Personally, I would recommend sticking with the video. It's one of those unusual cases where the movie is better than the book it's based upon."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A funny looking guy with weird eyes sets out to see if he can be worse than Scrooge, and pretty much decides to remove xmas from a town, usurping the whole thing.He soon is taught the error of his Anti Santa Front's ways, and learns to have a good time."
2,I don't get it!,"Recently, I decided it was time to read all of the books that are considered THE BEST in their category. For whatever reason I had never read Grinch, nor seen the movies-and I definately have no desire to got see the movies now.I don't get the story. What makes it so good? I love how the Grinch is sooooo bad, but am extremely disapointed how quickly his little heart turns to mush.Call me the Grinch, but I don't get it and I won't be giving this book as a gift either. Bah humbug."
4,This is a good book.,I am 8 and this book was fun to read and it made me laugh. I liked this book because it was funny when the Grinch stole the tree and couldn't get it up the chimney!
4,It's great for around the holidays!!!,I love reading it with my family during Christmas!!! As well as watching the movie!!!
5,Great book,It came in great condition. One of my favorite books to read at Christmas time. I highly recommend this book.
4,Exceeded my expectations,"I picked this item up on sale before having a chance to review it. After reading the three reviews on Amazon.com I was pretty sure I would be returning it. I live outside of Chicago which means finding an open frequency is not an easy task. I visited the Belkin site to identify ""the best available frequencies in my area."" I was a bit worried because even their first choice had weak reception of another station. However, once the Ipod was playing, the clarity and volume was wonderful. NOTE: that the transmitter location did have an effect on the reception, so move it around a bit. In the past when taking long trips, my daughters have taken a clock radio along in the car to listen to music. Now we have stereo sound throughout the car which means they can even use the wireless car headphones if they chose. I have only driven locally the last two days. If I experience problems while traveling further from home, I will update this review."
3,Will NOT charge 2nd gen iPod Touch...otherwise decent,"The FM transmitter works well enough if you keep the device close to the radio antenna...this is not necessarily near the radio. This might explain why so many reviewers are giving this device low marks. Please note that this unit will work with a 2nd gen iPod Touch; however, it will not charge the device."
2,What a disappointment,"This transmitter is not strong enough to even carry through a channel that had static. It does not go lower than 88.1, which makes it hard because most static stations are lower than that. When I tried another card, the ipod was really static. i was completely disappointed. I returned it."
2,Not that happy with the product,"I live in a rural area with only a few fm radio stations and have yet to try the product in an urban area. The sound is not great, I get alot of static and plan to return it."
4,Great transmitter,"I bought this a week ago and it works great for me. I live 30 miles out of NYC where there are a lot of FM stations, so finding an empty one was tough. I found a great one listed on the Belkin website. It was a 2nd choice station. Yes there is a hiss until the radio and transmitter sync. then sound is great. Yes, I think a dock would have been great to help with music selection, but others that had that were more then I wanted to spend. I also didn't see the ipod nano 3g listed as being compatible on thoses boxes as it is on this Belkin. Enjoy"
1,Terrible,"I received this as a present when my previous tuner broke. The signal is very weak, you have to practically attach the transmitter to the stereo itself to get it to work. When it is working the transmission comes in very soft and you have to crank you stereo way up to hear it at a normal volume. I had the Kensington tuner before and it was WAY better...I'm taking this back right away!"
3,glass knobs,not much of a choice when you need replacement knobs they do the job not high quality but for this price the work.
1,No Instructions - Probably doesn't do what was advertised,"This device is advertised as used to connect an audio device output to a GM Trailblazer Radio/Cd Player. It may or may not, but it certainly isn't clear how one would accomplish that. None of the connections on the wiring harness (basically, that's what this is) resemble an audio jack, nor are any labeled as such. Additionally, there are no instructions whatsoever, so it's not clear what this wiring harness is intended for. Don't waste your money."
4,Sweet,Great way to wind down during a long drive home. Easily singable; not at all annoying like some kids' CD's.
4,Songs of Praise,"Easy to sing along with because the songs are pitched correctly for kids...not too high, not too low. These songs are better suited for older kids."
4,good but not samples above are not for this CD,The CD is very very good but the samples above are not for this CD. This CD contains various artists and isn't live or 1/2 as rowdy as the samples above. I wish I could find out which CD that one is!
3,A bit disappointing,"I enjoyed most of this CD (""Lanigan's Ball"" and ""Goodbye Muirsheen Durkin,"" in particular), but some of it I found a bit lacking. The singer on Rocky Road To Dublin (and would you PLEASE credit the singers???) bit off the first word of almost every line, and I wasn't crazy about their arrangement of ""Finnegan's Wake"" (which, for my money, belongs for all time to the Clancy Brothers). With those couple of quibbles, an otherwise enjoyable CD."
2,Disappointed in Dublin,"I was disappointed in this cd. The first song is great! One of those you play again as soon as it's over, but after that...not much to get excited about. I've heard plenty of catchy irish pub songs that stick in your head long after you've heard them - and there aren't too many here. Too many slow, repetitive songs. There are much better choices out there. In addition, I agree with the other reviews here...it's unprofessional (and cheap looking) to not even bother to mention the singer's names. You gotta give credit where credit is due. That's just in bad taste."
5,A true classic! BUT WHO IS THE PERFORMER?,"I love this singer's voice and interpretation of the songs! So much spirit, so much character! (don't buy it if you want something that sounds elegant and beautiful) WHO IS THE BAND/SINGER? I want to hear more! Somebody sign this guy up, please!"
1,Sent Wrong item,I ordered 2 CD's and I was not sent the CD's that I ordered. The best of Irish Pub Songs: was never received. Instead they sent Irish Drinking Songs. It did not contain the songs that I wanted to hear. They were both gifts and I didn't have time to reorder. I am upset that I didn't get the CD I ordered. We had just been to Ireland and I wanted the songs that we heard while we were traveling there. I am not commenting on the Irish Pub Songs because I did not receive it. I am sure it is good.
5,Shakespeare and Self Knowledge,"Shakespeare Behind Bars is a fascinating look at how Shakespeare, even in, and particularly in, a prison setting can help us explore who we are. This is not a project whose only purpose is to ""put on a show"", but it's the process, not the product, which is invaluable. We see growing insight into each man's own humanity, self-revelation and understanding, and increased compassion for each other develop over the course of working on a play. Although we only see glimpses of the final product, we watch the intense emotional and intellectual involvement of each inmate. A very moving piece. The director of the play, who works closely with each actor/inmate, is to be commended for a very valuable look at what is possible."
2,Disappointing if you want to hear the inmates' voices,"I gave this DVD to my mother-in-law as a Christmas gift. She has been a social worker in a prison AND loves Shakespeare, so this seemed to be just the right thing. She found it to be much more about the filmmakers than the inmates -- she thought they would at least show the inmates doing a complete scene, but while they showed them rehearsing from a distance, they never really TALKED with them or showed any of their performances for any length of time. She was very disappointed and so was I -- it's a great idea for a project, but only partially realized from the viewer's point of view."
5,Enlightening and Entertaining,"The movie gives you a better understanding of what it means to be in prison. Watching the changes in the actors (prisoners) through the documentary shows how drama may lead to rehabilitation. They are articulate about what got them there and are serious about their acting part in the drama. The movie is entertaining, thought provoking and extremely well-done. It is a must-have addition to your video library. You will want to watch it several times."
3,Sixty Two Country Music favorites,I did not recognize most of the tunes as favorites. I can't rate the book as used/good. It was well used.
2,Not much of a legacy,"What a slow, dull, plodding book!For what it's worth, and that ain't much, the story concerns Indy's adventures in the American deserts, bookended by French mountains and Italian streets, as he hunts down a Unicorn horn that has magical powers. Yes, they really have sunk THAT low when trying to think of enchanting MacGuffins for our hero to go after.There are double crosses, and some extremely unexciting 'action' scenes, and a whole load of nothing else. I often think that Rob MacGregor's Indy stories have about 10 pages worth of mileage that he e-x-p-a-n-d-s to 300 or so with lots of filler and padded dialogue. It's such an infuriatingly boring read. The high-flying escapades we're used to seeing in the movies is a million miles from this cure for insomnia.For absolute hardcore Indy fans only, and even they won't enjoy it."
3,Fun read!,"This was the first Indy book i read bout a decade ago...and i still think of it as one of the best from this writer.Rob MacGREGOR is a great writer,i just dont think he captures the indy spirit and tone as well as Max McCoy does.Never the less he wrote some great books and this is one of them.Enjoy!!!"
3,Book is interesting but doesn't live up to Indy's standards.,"What can I say? This book is all right; It has an interesting plot and it's worth reading. However, it comes up a bit short when you consider that it's about the one, the only, Indiana Jones. I mean, there just isn't enough action on his part. The book seems to be centered on confusedly wandering around the desert, and there's too much talking. The main detail that makes this book worth reading is the alicorn. It is probably my favorite artifact yet, because of how it can bring both good and evil, and how it's owner's usually die of...but that would be telling."
4,indy,"My son is a big fan, so bought him a few of these. He read them, they kept his interest.. and he is a.d.d.... That's good enough for me."
5,Beautiful,"Beautifully written study on psychology of a criminal. This book is a masterpiece. Not so much due to prose or even dialogue, but the content. The journey with raskolinikov is rendered perfectly."
3,"Great concept, bad title","This would be a much better book if the author would change the title. While the title may accurately reflect the feelings of some siblings, the book might get left around the house and generate some hurt feelings. Because of this, I keep it in my closet bookshelf, not in my waiting room.Once past the title, the book has wonderful, amusing illustrations and the text keeps elementary school siblings interested. The sister eventually does come to appreciate her impulsive brother, but kids will keep coming back to that title..."
5,Superb album from 1986.,"Smith, Cure, Midnight oil fans should give this album a try. The Lemons were part of this pre-Manchester scene called ""C-86"". Using punk ideals but making them more melodic but still powerful is the idea here... Simple, fun and emotional tunes. A great buy especially with the bonus tracks! get it."
1,gerber baby brush,I ordered a pink one.....but I got a blue one. The gift I thought I was giving is useless.
3,My least favorite of the Aunt Dimity books,"After the debut novel, I expected another such book, but this one did not grab me as much as the first book--but I am happy to report that none of the following books disappointed.The action and the plot did not seem as crisp; the entanglements dangled. YMMV, of course, but I felt this one was not as well polished as the others.However, it's better than many others I have read, in series where the action became formulaic, and the characters pasteboard icons."
2,Not as good as book 1,"I read book 1 and decided when I finished it to immeditaley buy book 2, but to be honest book 2 was quite a deception. No paranormal stuff in this one, I got really annoyed by the tone of the Duke and there were quite some editing errors (incorrect sentences, letters of words misisng) plus Aunt Dimity was playing a very, very, very small part in this book.Still hesitating if I should continue with the series. Good for a beach holiday, but that's about it."
5,Entertaining little mystery,This book is well written and kept my interest. I will definitely buy more of Nancy Atherton's books for my Kindle.
3,Aunt Dimity and the Duke,"I read all the Aunt Dimity books. This one was a little slower in the beginning, but once your in, it's a good read. I liked that the main character wasn't Lori Shepard, but rather focuses on her best friend. It helped bring her character to life in the other books. I reccommend reading the whole series."
4,Another great Dimity book,"The Aunt Dimity series is made up of great, light reads that are really fun. No heavy thinking here; just an enjoyable, lighthearted book. As I was reading this one, though, I kept expecting Lori to appear, but she didn't. I really think this book should go before Aunt Dimity's Death, not after. At any rate, it was still a very enjoyable read, and I recommend it."
2,CORN?,really? horses going back to the barns for CORN? does helen hollick know that corn wasn't introduced to europe until 1000 yrs later? research. it's a good thing.
2,Disappointment,"This book came highly recommended to me, both by friends and by the excellent reviews here and on Barnes & Noble's site. (And it has such a pretty cover!) Despite this, I was disappointed by it.Plotwise, I believe that Hollick accomplishes her goal in providing a gritty, Dark Ages version of Arthur. That bit she does well. However, there was too much smut in it for my taste (numerous sex scenes, description of a rape). I wish someone had mentioned that to me before I bought it, because I would have spent my $16 on something else (for example, Parke Godwin'sFirelord, which is written in a similar style (Arthur as a military leader rising to power in Roman Britain) but is a more ingenious and well-written narrative overall)."
4,A very different Arthur!,"Helen Hollick has refused to be constrained by the stereotypical Arthur we all know through legend - and of course TV! She has created a very different man and we get to know him, his life and loves, warts and all. This Arthur is very human and not always the good guy. But he is a lovable larrikin and, despite his flaws, we're left in no doubt that he's the hero. Gwen, the love of his life is no shrinking violet either - a feisty, courageous woman and definitely a good match for Arthur. This is a fascinating book. I'm now reading the second one of the trilogy. It's great fun getting to know all the characters and learn about their lives in 5th Century Britain. Thanks Helen!"
2,what good is it....,if it doesn't come with installation hardware? There is absolutely nothing included in the box except for the damper. Spend your money on a competitor's product.
4,Shia Fan,"I think this is his first movie, based on the Disney TV thing. It's good.I have all his released videos. Major fan."
5,FINALY!!!,"I can't say much about the DVD it's self, but the movie is great! I'm just happy that they are putting Even Stevens anything on DVD. This show was great."
3,More used then stated,Cover ripped and personal note written inside on the cover! Should have said that and had I known that I would not have ordered
3,Just a hinge,"I bought these hinges, in the Oil Rubbed Bronze finish, to replace existing hinges of the same manufacture/style/design/type. They are OK and do their job. BUT I was really disappointed to learn that they were made in China, like so many other products are. Why can't these American Companies make their products in the good old USA and support this country by hiring workers who actually live within our borders. Sad, sad, sad.....therefore I am only giving it a 3 star rating."
4,Go get a movie and start cookin'!,"This is a great cookbook for entertaining! The recipes are fun and most are easy! You can plan a whole menu, have some friends over, and pop in the movies!"
5,Excellent product when you follow the directions,"Like some here, at first I wasn't too successful. THEN I decided to read the directions, and followed them to a T. When you do that, esp if you can properly hold it down to make a good seal, this thing works Fabulously!With an old house and old pipes, for now it's much cheaper to clear our shower drain about once a month with this device. Plus, it's not pouring harmful chemicals to do it!"
2,Destroyed my pipes,"I'm sure this thing works under most conditions. However, on the first try the blast of air snapped the plastic tightening ring connecting the dispose all pipe from the main drain line. The backed up, cruddy water soaked everything under the sink and ruined my lunch hour.From now on I'll only use on the toilets."
3,"Sadly, it didn't work for me","The Kleer Drain Instant Drain Opener seemed like a great idea, clean to use and NO chemicals. Sadly, it didn't work for me. The problem was a clogged tub drain. I followed all the instructions and was careful to securely block the overflow openings. There was a grand ""whoosh"" and I really thought the drain would clear, but it didn't. I tried 2 times and nothing. Then I tried it on an upstairs bathroom sink that was running a little slow. Another grand ""whoosh"" and the sink became totally clogged. I guess it's time to call the plumber."
1,Ineffective,"This gadget did not work for me. Sure, it sprayed around a lot of water but it failed to dislodge any blockage in the kitchen sink or bathroom tub. The whole CO2 cartridge and ""power disk"" thing is just a gimmick. I used all the supplied cartridges and disks as well as another package of same and did not obtain good results. While the idea using of forced air to clear a drain is a good one, I think it's better to use a device that you don't have to buy expensive replacement components for. I'll try the hand pumped models next time around. Or just call a plumber!"
1,does'nt work,I purchased it last night and was very exicted to use it on my kitchen sink. I tried one cartridge it did not to anything then i tried 3 more it still did not anything.I am very unsatisfied with this product. Bottom line spend little bit more and call plumber.
5,Life saver!,"First, let me preface by saying that we have 4 daughters and a big hairy dog. Clogs happen here, and when they do, it is a catastrophe. This time, I spent hours yesterday trying to rod out my bathroom sink. Tried vinegar and baking soda, also. Everything I did just seemed to make it worse so that no water would go down at all. I went to the hardware store, and the guy told me not to use a chemical since I had already used vinegar. Ugh. I was close to caving and calling a plumber when I remembered Kleer Drain. I had used it a few years ago when my toilet clogged, and I was hosting Thanksgiving. It had worked like a charm then. I had one air bullet left. Yay! It worked and took all of 5 minutes. Next time, I will use Kleer Drain first. No more messy rodding for me! Thank you, MAG, for making such an excellent product. Even a mom like me, who knows nothing of plumbing, can successfully use this device."
1,Big waste of money!,"I usually don't write many reviews, but felt I should due to the horrible experience I had. This product seems like it would work, but it didn't for me. I tried using it to clear a sink drain. The only thing I succedded in was spraying water all over my bathroom because the cone would not seat around the concave of the bowl.I feel real dumb for dropping money on this thing. The worst part is there is no easy way to contact the company to tell them how I feel!"
1,Very dull,"I purchased this book in 1998, as it was a mandatory purchase for academic purposes. Prior to reading this work, it appeared to have potential. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. This book only dicsusses one particular case study, and although the topic is an extremely important one, the author's writing style makes for a dull read. I do not recommend this book at all."
2,good first 40 pages,"This book was good for the first 40 pages but that's it. Hochschild gets across the interesting truth that some Americans work and don't spend time with their families because work is a reprieve from the stress of home and family life. This is really the crux of the book; the rest is mainly filler. Hochschild doesn't provide much more insight or scientific rigor and support to these observations. I agree with the above reviewer that the writing is quite poor: convoluted; however, I wouldn't even give the writing the compliment of being novel-like. The writing is trite and character placements a headache."
2,tedious and dry,"While it is commendable that the author avoids the verbal fakery, jargon and obfuscation so common amongst academic authors, it is hard to imagine a flatter, duller narrative. The evidence on offer here is anecdotal and therefore of limited value, and since the anecdotes are so mundane, there seems little reason to read the book. Most adults can furnish their own supply of similar stories, have already come to some of the same conclusions, and won't find the insights very insightful. Sociology remains thin stuff."
2,Some good insights but nothing real original.,"The basis of this book is great and the author has a terrific way with words but she loses the reader after about page 55, where she goes off into all sorts of liberal and unproven theories about modern family life. Her research was limited to one major American company and does not illuminate why there are so many problems in balancing work and family life."
4,"Despite what some people think, it's about home.","The Time Bind is not about work. The reason that Hochschild uses so much work based data is because she wants to show that there is nothing at work in particular that makes us HAVE to be there. She talks about the horrible lack of support for young families that ends up making work more pleasant than home because at least at work parents are supported and know when they are doing the right thing or the wrong thing. (At home you never know if taking or not taking the lollipop from your 2-year-old will render them into raving loonies in 20 years.) The only time she really gets into how work itself contributes is when she says that many family friendly policies are an illusion or are believed to be an illusion by the workers. However, this book is not quite as clear as the Second Shift, which I thought was brilliant. It is also clarified by a knowledge of the Second Shift; it's easier to see the family orientation if you're familiar with her other work."
4,Nice price! Satisfied with quality!,The book was in good shape. Super nice and cheap price! I have saved a lot from it! oh and i Got the book really quickly! Very nice indeed!
2,too flimsy for children,"the book is cute enough, but it is printed very cheaply--too easy for little ones to destroy."
1,BAD BAD CD,THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST CD I'VE PURCHASED IN YEARS. ALL RE RECORDINGS THAT SOUND NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINALS. DON'T BUY IT.
5,Good product,It works so well I was able to trim my cats nails by myself. She actually purrs while I do it and tries to play with the trimmers. Great product.
5,Great product!,"I was very wary buying any nail clipper for my Marmalade. I'm a nervous kitty mom and I was so worried that the clipper would hurt her. I was worried for nothing! This is a great product. It was simple to use, it cut Marmalade's nail quickly and she never even flinched. The whole process took 2 minutes tops. I am so glad I purchased the clippers and highly recommend them to everyone who wants to cut their cats' nails at home. I did buy the replacement blades too, just to have them on hand for when I need them."
3,Dull blade,"Well made item, easy to hold. Cuts vertically, not horizontal like scissors which is good. Problem is that it still splits the nail b/c blade is not very sharp. I've not yet been able to cut the nails cleanly, without it leaving a jagged end. Maybe I'm not doing it right; although the instructions were rather plain."
3,Blade needs some work,The tried and tested design of these trimmers are awesome and overall do a better job that most other solutions. They are made solid and feel like a quality product. However You should make sure the blade is nice and sharp upon deliver as one of the pairs I purchased had a very dull blade that just ends up spliting your cats nails and results in a lot of scratches to you.The trimmer with the sharper blade I received ended up getting dull over time so I sharped both and they seem to work and cut clean. Once you become familiar with how to use them they do nice clean cuts with no hassle.
1,dont buy these clippers,"these clippers are a waste of money, i would stick to the ones that you can buy in your vets ofc, these are dull and the spring is constantly falling off, very disappointed in this product!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very disappointing,"I ordered this book because it has been described as the best Ethnographic work in existence for the Samoan Matai system. The book was described as in ""Very Good"" condition. It came with doodles, sloppy green highlighting, ink pen scribbles - this is an abused book.In addition, the yellow cover they displayed is the original book, and is the one I thought I was getting. What I got was a copy, which means the photos are terrible.If this provider considers this to be ""Very good"", I know I'll never use them again."
3,Interesting but repetative in its focus,"Quite an interesting representation of a society that Margaret Mead owes her fame to. O'Mera has lead the reader through the customs and daily practices of wonderful society in a modestly coloquial frame. Unfortunately, the information becomes repetative in its apraoch, and tends to lack the excitement as is renowned in Chagnon's writing, never the less, well worth the read about a wonderful, uniquely diverse culture"
5,Pure glycerin,This is pure glycerin for the skin and can be mixed with other emollients. It does not need to be in the refrigerator. Shipped on time.
5,A Guide for Everyday Healthy Living,"""The Art of Health with Gary Null"" is a pleasure to watch and provides practical, easy-to-follow guidance on healthy living. Gary shows the viewer just how simple it is to eat better, live better, and feel better. The DVDs are extremely easy to navigate and the entire package is first-rate. Highly recommended -- I'm better for having watched this."
4,Good for Alabama fans,This CD has many of the songs that will be favorites for fans of Alabama and it is just fun to listen to.
4,Great trip to Christmas past!,"Two DVDs full of Christmas shows from long ago -- many I'd never seen before! The film quality isn't always perfect, but it's pretty good considering the shows are 50 years old. Will provide hours of family entertainment over the holidays!"
3,Holiday Classics,"The shows brought back memories but to say the ""film quality wasn't always perfect"" is a gross understatement. Still, it's a pleasure to see the ""oldies"" and I'm glad we bought the set although we never heard of about half the shows, such as ""The Adventures of Long John Silver"", ""The Ruggles"", ""Robin Hood"", ""Date With Angels"", ""Meet Corliss Archer"" and ""The Racket Squad"". After watching some of the unknown shows once, we will not watch them again. Our grown children remember ""Red Skelton"" as a favorite and everyone got a chuckle watching George and Gracie advertise products all the way through their show. We also wondered what we ever saw in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" show. How times have changed."
1,Disappointed,"When I ordered this DVD, I was hoping to see Red Skelton at his best. Instead there only about 2 episodes with him. This was a long and no so funny disappointing DVD."
1,DISAPOINTED I,"VERY DISAPOINTED WITH TTHIS DVD. VERY,VERY,VERY AND I SAY VERY POOR QUALITY AUDEO AND VEDIO. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY."
4,Samples From The Long Voyage,"This is a compilation of material from the original TV series through the movie franchise. It is a very good sampler, though is certainly not a means to get a full appreciation of the material as it fit into the story being told through an entire album - or multiple releases for the original TV series - that are available.The long voyage is presented in a neat package, though an extended chronicle may still be required for the captain's log."
5,Cheese Knife,This is absolutely worth every penny! It is the best knife for cutting all sorts of cheeses...cuts smoothly and quickly! A must have for every cooks kitchen!
5,A Plastic Miracle,Don't be fooled by the look or feel of the knife because it is amazing. This is THE Cheese Knife. Don't be fooled by any others.
5,Great product MADE IN USA,"Just a note to add to the previous good comments, the important thing is that this product works as intended."
2,Get the larger one,"I have used one of these cheese knives for a year. It works well. The blade is 7 "" long. I bought this one intending to give it as a gift. This particular cheese knife only sports a blade of 4"", probably OK for a serving utensil, but not adequate for robust kitchen use. I think most cooks would prefer the longer blade."
3,"good, but not stiff enough","For VERY soft cheeses, this knife is excellent. It does a good job of not sticking to the cheese as you cut down.However, I cut a lot of slightly stiffer soft cheeses, which distort heavily with a my other cheese knife (and of course with a standard knife as well...).This knife deflects side-to-side too much in these cheeses - eg it is tough to cut straight down through the block: the cutting edge wants to pop out toward the open face, and putting a little force (rotation) on the handle doesn't effectively counteract this tendency.To a lesser extent, the tip of the knife also wants to eject, eg the near the handle I'm cutting a 1/4"" slice, but towards the tip the slice thickness decreases & decreases as I cut down.Why can't anyone make a perfect knife for this very specific need??? I do believe this knife would be perfect if it were metal or some sort of reinforced plastic."
3,The Cheese Knife,Knife is goood but there was no packaging included as it is when purchased locally & for a gift it's disappointing.
2,OK. Not as good as the other one we bought.,Bought two different cheese knives to try out. This one did not make the cut. Cheese still sticks to it too much.
1,You're kidding right?,"Wow, so many glowing reviews. Apparently none of you already own the skinny bladed vegetable knife that I've been using for years. Works great on cheese and veggies. It costs about 3.99, is made of genuine metal not plastic, and doesn't shatter when you drop it on the floor from any height. I'm sending this $.49 paint scraper back, and really have to question how much value I put in the reviews of other shoppers here in the future. If I had paid under $10 for it I wouldn't bother, but I paid the full bent-over price of $18 and am not willing to be skewered like that."
4,Unique cheese knife,"This is a nice cheese knife for soft cheeses. Not very fancy so I wouldn't use it for when company is over unless it's a jeans/casual/potluck sort of thing. I made the mistake of using it to cut a hard sheep's milk that had a rind. It was tough to do and cut crooked and later on I realized the knife was bent. It reminded me of those aluminum office blinds that gets caught in the window or accidently crushed so it's bent and stays bent. I tried straightening the knife edge back and it's pretty straight but a little wavy, almost like it got stretched a bit. So just use this on soft cheeses."
2,Fine until it snapped in two; manufacturer appears to be out of business,"The Cheese Knife worked fine for me for at least a year, so perhaps I shouldn't complain. But I think the knife should have been more durable. One day recently while I was cutting some soft cheese, it suddenly snapped, breaking into two pieces. Since the manufacturer is located right here where I live (Tucson), I thought I might get a response by visiting their Website and leaving my phone number. No luck. The form for entering a question does not work, and my email inquiry did not even go though. It appears that they are out of business."
2,soft plastic,"I feel like I paid way too much for this. It is soft plastic, so the cutting edge dulls too easily. I tossed it out."
4,Cheese knife,This knife is very sharp and cuts cheese in a variety of thicknesses without shredding the cheese. Some difficulty keeping the thickness consistant. With practice it may become easier to control the slice.
4,cuts the cheese,"On an off chance I purchased this knife to replace a wire style cheese slicer that had broken, another one that had broken. This knife works very well and surprisingly cuts a very thin slice. I can say that I am pleased with my purchase."
2,Good...while it lasts,"This knife worked exceptionally well for about 6 months, cutting through hard cheese like butter. We would show it off to family and friends like other reviewers, amazed that plastic performed so well. But then it started cutting very poorly. You would expect that a plastic knife would lose its edge but that was not the problem. The knife became too pliable, cutting creative patterns through our cheddar and colby. Fine if you are going for some eye catching h'ordeuvres but rather irritating when making a cheese sandwich. I don't know what caused the plastic to become so wavy because we only hand washed it, (we don't have a dish washer). We are rather big cheese fans so it might have been the high amount of use we gave it. Either way we are now shopping for a metal knife, even if it doesn't work as well at first at least we know that it won't turn to jelly."
3,"Good News, Bad News","I absolutely loved the knife when it was in one piece. Very soon after buying it, probably the third time I used it, the knife snapped into two pieces--white knife part and yellow handle part. I struggled to use it without the handle and finally just threw into the trash. I wouldn't take a chance on another one."
5,Amazing product,"I first met this wonderful product at my daughter-in-law's home. I inquired as to where she bought it and replied that it was a Christmas gift. Immediately I searched Amazon.com and (of course) found it with no problem. I ordered one for myself and knew my daughter HAD to have it also. Throw away your old cheese cutters! This is so amazing. This ""knife"" (not like any knife I have)allows you to cut a very thin slice with no problem. Buy it!! There will be no regrets."
3,Should be less Flexible,"For larger, Costco sized blocks of Cheddar cheese, this knife fails to deliver even slices. Reason being is that the knife will flex and your cut will be influenced by the cheese, especially if it's been aged for some time. The result? Uneven but very edible pieces of cheese. This is not a precision instrument - it should be made out of a fiber-glass like polymer instead. I will probably be replacing it sometimes soon - it's not a priority since it works fine under most circumstances now. This item should have been half the cost - I may contact the manufacturer about this flaw."
3,Size not disclosed,Our local cheese shop has a crock full of the bigger size knives of this model for $19.00 a piece. I thought this one was the bigger of the two models not the small one. I paid the same for this one with shipping.
4,nice bible songs,"Nice songs. The fact that we could listen to the songs from the CD before we bought it online, made it a worthwhile buy."
5,Awesome!,"I am so happy with this product.Action Bible SongsOne day I was trying to find songs that I could teach to my daughter that had motions and I stumbled upon this one. The moment I started playing the songs, I was completely surprised when my daughter (almost 2), started singing with them! This happens to be the cd they use at her Sunday School Class, or Children's Ministry. She lights up every time we play the cd and sing along! It's wonderful to have the same thing from church to play at home...and for a great price!"
3,review,"I have a childrens group and well i think the songs are perfect, wish they had the movements to go with it!"
1,got this product and the songs were skipping,The songs are good but it just kept skipping. I think we just got a defective cd. Otherwise it's good.
4,a nice journey,"If u want a nice journey, with shades of Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young, Jethro Tull, Death Cab for Cutie, and a pinch of stoner rock, then you will like this. This may be the best 99 cents song I've ever bought."
3,"Well, they sure have guts, i'll give 'em that","We Irish are a bit protective when it comes to people taking liberties with our culture - which is pretty much what the brits did for centuries. As well as, sadly, americans. people in america think it's cute to put on a plastic green hat and run around like an idiot on st paddy's and say 'i'm irish!' What's that got to do with this album? The Tain is a very powerful and well known bit of irish history and mythology. If you want to learn about THAT, forget THIS. If you want to see what happens when a good band decides to take a risk, then you might enjoy this one. But it's got f*** all to do with irish mythology or music."
1,What were they thinking??,This CD is just plain TERRIBLE!!! A 4 part rock opera about the Tain that has absolutly nothing to do with The Tain??? Did they even bother to read the original??? Don't waste your time or money.
5,Your reward's in the sweet bye and bye.,"This is probably the Decemerists' best offering yet. After seeing them in support of Crane Wife, I was left thinking, ""it would have been awesome if they had played The Tain instead of the whole Crane Wife movement."" If you like the good stuff, this is probably the best thing they've done yet, and I'm pretty into them. And I don't think it's like if anyone married Pink Floyd."
3,Questionable,"This was a well writen book,except for the section where Steve talks about Master Fard coming to Detroit in the 1930's and instilling self-pride in the black community.He(steve) made the small mistake of accusing W.D.Fard of instigating hostility of blacks with the police. Quote"" after they heard the teachings,they where given new names,and identification cards.Where they paraded out into the streets,throwing it up in every white person's face. I personally dont believe it happened that way. Muslim's are taught to be honorable,and law biding.Why would they go out to provoke harrasment? especially back then,when the FBI wanted them destroyed?"
3,"Pretty good, but a bit misplaced in my eyes","Another short book from The Great Philosophers Series. Although Popper is most famous for his philosophy of science, this book dwells mostly upon his political theory. I suppose that is okay, but this approach somewhat misrepresents why Popper is an important philosopher for us today. After all, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of science of this century. I get the feeling Raphael was not comfortable with science writing, which makes me wonder why the editors put him on this project. Don't get me wrong, the writing was accessible and informative on Popper's political theory, but it just seemed a bit misplaced, given what I take this series of books is concerned with."
3,"Great photo's, not story's!",Osprey books are great photo albums but they aren't the story telling kind of book I was expecting. That was my mistake. They do have a small amount of storie relating to each pilot but very short in nature.If your looking for storie's about missions throughout a pilot's tour or the war these are not for you. They tend to follow an aircraft's war career instead of the pilots.But again nice photo's.
1,SOUR,"Beware: this is NOT remastered. Though I loved this album and it does include a handful of bonus tracks, the sound is the same as the original CD 20 years ago. Worse yet, one of the bonus tracks (a demo, no less) is about 4 times as loud as the regular album.This is a head-scratcher of a reissue. In this day and age, to simply reissue a 20 year old album without remastering is a joke. I can remaster the thing on my computer in 30 mins."
4,"Great album from the 80s, or any era...","This is a straightforward, rousing rock & roll album that sounds as fresh as the day it was released. World Without End doesn't have the quaint retro sound that many of the more acclaimed ""college rock"" bands of this era had-- instead the Lemon Drops relied on basic rock riffs and some extremely solid playing."
5,Thought-Provoking,"This book has it all: horror, fine scientific facts blended with an engrossing plot, believable characters, superb storyline, and fine descriptions of the settings. This made me really think about what the government is doing behind our backs, and the ethics of cloning. I strongly encourage you to buy this book."
3,tranquillo,"I bought this book two days ago and have to say that I have strugglled to put it down since. For anyone with an interest in travel and the charismatic characters one meets this is an essential read. It is written in almost a novel format and whilst this does much to enrich the individual chapters I did feel that this style did mean that some of the warmth of the principal characters was lost.In this sense it fell short of other books in the genre, notably Chris Stewart's Driving over lemons. However, Kerr's detailed descriptions of his neigbours were a pleasue to read. At times it is laugh out loud funny and just looking at the next paragraph would prompt another outburst. A good read. Now where is my passport?"
4,How to pretend you're actually living in Spain,"If you find yourself fantasizing about living in Spain, love everything to do with Spain you'll like this book. The only thing that slightly frustrated me was trying to figure out the era; finally I deduced it was between 1990-2000 because of the references to pesetas and raves. Anyway, I'm moving on to the others in this series in the year in Mayorca now. Also I should mention the humour is very British, or as the author would probably prefer I say, Scottish. So beware."
3,Boogie boogie!,"Based on cover art alone, the best picture here is ""Dr. Jekyll..."" The 1931 Rouben Mamoulian-directed version of this Robert Louis Stevenson story is definitely one of its best adaptations.What's left of this set is rather pedestrian: ""The Brain..."" and ""Killer Shrews"" are both low-budget drive-in movie double feature material, while ""Zombies"" is a WWII era 'B' pic that was once advertised thusly: ""HUMAN SACRIFICES! SAVAGE TORTURE! VOODOO RITES!""One can only hope so....Another interesting small collection of vintage scary movies isFRIGHT NIGHT 10 MOVIE PACK, from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT..Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll ratings.(3.2) The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962) - Jason Evers/Virginia Leith(7.7) Dr.Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (1931) - Fredrick March/Miriam Hopkins(2.8) The Killer Shrews (1959) - James Best/Ingrid Goude(4.7) King of the Zombies (1941) - Dick Purcell/Joan Woodbury/Mantan Moreland"
5,"Horror Classics 4 Pack, Vol. 1: Killer Shrew/King of the Zombies/Brain","Great movies for rainy days, stormy nights, and anytime! This collection of ""B"" titles takes me back to my childhood, when you could see these on late Friday nights. If you like old sci-fi, horror flicks, this is certainly one to have."
2,Short renditions of German Favorites,"This is the CD that is Volume 2 of All the Best From Germany, but it is mislabeled there. Save some money and get the two volume set. There are only 5 duplicates. The problem with this CD is that too many of the selections are less than one minute long and are better suited to medleys. Some songs do not correspond to the CD title."
4,A fine utility watch,This watch combines the convenience of atomic synchronization with the freedom from battery replacement as it is solarly powered. The only drawback is that after some time the night light feature stopped working.
4,For a person who just became a Mother!,"I purchased the ring for my niece, because she was having her first child. His name is JJ- so she is wearing the ring ever since he was born."
4,Pretty Nice,"This is a great ring for the money. While it doesn't look very expensive, it's still makes a great sentimental gift to your mother. My mother is never seen without this ring. She wears it more than her wedding ring."
3,"Nice, but hardly ""spectacular""","I bought this DVD for my dad, as we both enjoy model trains and gardening. It's pleasant enough, but quite a bit short of ""spectacular."" There's way too much talking, with the camera on the speaker rather than on the trains or gardens, and, in particular, too much camera footage of a train just circling around on a wooden platform in a yard, with no real garden in sight. Some of the setups are really nice; there are just too few of the good ones. We enjoyed it most just having it running on the screen, as a sort of side show during conversation, with the DVD's own sound turned off and other music playing in the room."
4,Amazon's Garden Railroad Spectacular,This film contains some amazing workmanship and exacting detail. The layouts are beautifully done. The films covers several garden railroad layouts.
1,Not great,The rubber nose piece broke off the first day. Weak! I don't like them. Nor would I recommend them to anyone even though I love dewalt.
4,All the Best from Austria and Switzerland,"Some very good music, not a typical polka album. Entertaining is a good way of describing this album."
1,Also misled by picture and description,"The picture and description made it sound like both the base and the tape were included, but all you get is the tape. Very misleading. will not buy again."
1,Not Sticky!,"I have been unable to find the good old Mcconnell tape, so I decided to try Endura Sports tape. I have found that it does not hold well against movement, loosens quickly into any session or activity. If you add sweat, which every athlete does, the stick is gone immediately. I have preped the skin prior to taping without success as well."
2,Disappointing,"I'm basically a fairly nice, sensitive, compassionate person. But I was flabbergasted by the advice for Mistake #5 (Reasoning with Irrationality). This chapter suggests using empathy, compassion, and an incredibly huge amount of patience to deal with an irrational attack. This approach is totally unrealistic. Only a very small percentage of human beings are capable of this much empathy, compassion, and patience. I really wanted some help with this problem and now I feel totally ripped off"
4,pretty good,"love it...just put it in my hedrest ,,sound great,,good quality,,,thank you again,,amazon....great deal...recomendado............i gonna get another one for my wife..."
4,overall good for price,"ive bought three of these monitors to hook up to my indash dvd player for the price these screens are worth it even though they dont have sound, they show real good picture no complaints"
5,Wow,"This monitor is excellent for temporary installations and to monitor video signals that go elsewhere. It's extremely crisp, mountable, and would be worth twice the price.I've used these monitors all over the world - there's no better bargain out there."
4,RV Backup monitor,Bought this for use as a backup monitor on the RV. Installed fine and been working fine for a week. Seems like a great deal.
1,Beware,"Behold! you must know that all Pyle products are of poor quality and last few months only, with no available after sales servicing nor spare parts. Not the seller nor the manufacturer will provide any guarantee or service, so if you buy it, you are totally wasting your money."
3,TV Monitor,"Many times a TV Monitor is really a TV, THIS IS NOT! It is only a monitor and has no reception capabilities."
3,50/50,"I bought two of these monitors for my kids along with a universal headreast mound because they were too big to mount in the actual headrest. They worked fine for a month or two, then one of them turns off by itself and cannot be turned back one without remove power multiple times. I have tried to contact Pyle by email about a month ago and they haven't replied yet. I will try to call them tomorrow, hopefully we can get this resolved."
4,Well worth the money spent!,The monitors were very easy to install myself. The picture quality is very clear. I had bought two of these monitors plus two universal head rest mounts to keep my daughters entertained in the car. They are well worth the money spent.
4,Good little LCD screen,"As the other reviews state, this is designed to be hard wired to a vehicle's electric system, although you can go to any car parts store and get a cigarette lighter adapter for less than $5.That being said, I am very happy with this purchase. The install was easy and once the audio and video are wired into your vehicle you can detach the monitor from the cable and stow it away without having to unwire everything. 2 inputs is very handy. Have had it for a year and it's still working great. Makes all the long car rides with the kids quite tolerable."
3,LG VX4400 Battery 1500,Please buy this item with a separate charger. Your normal charger that came with the phone will not work.
2,Dysfunctional people all playing mind games.,"I didn't enjoy this very much. Every couple tearing apart their relationship in cliche ways that no one would bother with today. In fact, it was excruciating to watch everyone being so stupid. I guess we have all grown and learned since the '70's. But I did have a favorite part: When Bea and her husband were trying to find out from their son what the story was on his divorce. My favorite line, ""You marry for happiness? You marry for happiness and you'll be MISERABLE!!"" I also liked looking at the dated clothes, decorating, and dancing. That was fun. You could not immitate that today."
1,Dated and surprisingly unfunny,"I had not seen this film for about 25 years, and I looked forward to watching it again. If, like me, you enjoy Cloris Leachman and Bea Arthur, in particular, then you are surely tempted to pick up this DVD. May I suggest you rent it first?For me, this film has the sort of period-specific humor that does not age well. Now, it seems forced and quite unfunny (unless you still laugh at homophobic jokes, for example), and it doesn't even hold any charm as a time capsule. It's ""Love American Style"" -- unbearable to watch now -- stretched into movie length."
4,One of the best in a generation,"This is one of the funniest movies for an entire generation. Funny & sad at the same time but, You will laugh."
5,Lovers and Other Strangers,"Cy Howard's knowing, often side-splitting ensemble piece benefits from stand-out turns by Gig Young (as the bride's philandering father), Anne Jackson (as the object of his adulterous affections), and Richard Castellano as the groom's awkward but well-meaning Dad. Bob Dishy almost steals the movie as a would-be Casanova. Wonderful early `70s flavor, and look for a young Diane Keaton as the groom's unhappy sister-in-law."
1,Kitchen ache,"Mine died after one month past its warrenty. The shaft that holding the attachment was falling! Which you can't fix by yourself becasue it was air-compressed to the place. Sending back to the factory won't make sense. For one, it cost $150.00 or more. Secondly, it is doomed to happen again becuase it is a design flaw. Googled how to fix kitchenaid pro 600, you will be amazed by the numbers of people owning a broken Kitchenaid mixer.I should have seriously considered the negative reviews. I didn't realize that Kitchenaid was no longer made by Hobart which earns the previous models amazing reputation. Sad to have to add a big trash to the landfill."
1,"Don""t buy this mixer!!!",My Kitchenaid 600 never worked right-it was so loud from day one you couldn't hear anything else-after 90 days it stopped-after $125 repair it worked better for a few months then stopped during Cinnamon Rolls (soft dough and only a half batch) another $95 it kinda works-i bought many of the attachments and this is what keeps me from throwing it in the trash!! Save yourself alot of money and go with another brand!!!!
3,Bread machine is better for making bread dough,"For more than a year, I have been used Breadman bread machine to knead dough twice a week. It's still working but I was thinking to have a stand mixer for more baking task for while.I bought KitchAid professional 600 Series just before Christmas. The first dough was kneat perfectly in two minutes. However, one week later, I wanted to make two doughs, 3 or 4 cups each. The machine broke and quit at the second dough.Now, I need to go back to my old bread machine for bread dough."
4,Great but too big,"I made pasta by hand and it too everything I had. My Italian cousins said they all use KitchenAid so I shopped them. My mother ad Swedish said get the bigger one because she had the 5 Qt and it was too small. I received mine and tried pasta for just myself, one cup of flour and one egg. unfortunately the dough mixer can't reach something this small. I lent it to my mother and she loved it so we are thinking of switching. The refund also came in record time, I'm totally satisfied with the purchase."
4,Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer,"This is a replacement for my Kitchen Aid Mixer that I purchased thirty some years ago! This new one has a larger bowl which is what I needed. I loved my old Kitchen Aid Mixer! I did notice that the knob to move the speed is not as good quality as that of my old one. The bowl itself is larger, but doesn't seem as good quality as the old bowl. I find that it's slow to start when I move the speed knob. It's also noiser which is understandable since it's a heavier model. I haven't used it much yet, but plan to soon!"
2,The grinder does not work?,"This is the third Mixer for the last 3 years. The first was replaced by kitchenaid within the first year. The second is still in the cabinet I use it to make dough and it is great.The grinder does not work or if it works (2 minutes) or it gets hot and you will lose it. You will damage the housing and the extended warranty will not repair it. So, Kitchenaid should look into having good durable materials for the housing parts. I guess I need to buy grinder only. Even thought I am paying for both grinder and mixer.I would not recommend it for grinding. Also, it is too expensive for mixer only. I am Wondering Why CR did not comment on these issues."
5,Made in USA,"The quality of this battery made me smile when I installed it in my motorcycle. The measurements were spot on, the fit was exact for my '94 BMW Oilhead and the mounting hardware included was stainless. Stoked to see some people still make a good product here in the states at a good price."
1,Early failure,"I bought this battery to use in my storm shelter. I fully charged it and put it in the shelter hooked up to an all weather radio and DC power outlet, but no other loads. The radio was off and left off. After a month I checked it and it only had 2 volts, it had failed. I tried charging at the recommended voltage, but the charger showed an open cell. The fine print in the users manual says that if the voltage is less than 2 volts then it has been discharged by the user and the warranty is voided. Yea, I guess I am out the cost of the battery and will just go to Walmart and get a more traditional battery."
2,Didn't even last through the build process,"I bought this battery for a Guzzi Le Mans I have been building. The battery has been used to start the bike maybe 5 times, used to test lights & wiring, etc.. Always trickle charged.Last night I accidentally left the ignition on overnight, and the taillight ran the battery down. Its not the first time I've done such a thing, and usually recharging isn't an issue. This battery will not. In short, I bought a premium battery expecting long service life, and never even got to use it on the bike! I'm not bothering with the warranty, because its worded to deny pretty much any claim. Just a word of warning for those looking at more expensive batteries... these may not take the abuse a cheaper, more robust battery would. The $30 lawnmower batteries sold at Autozone have served me better, weight an size excepted."
3,Does not fit into R1200RT,"The battery does not fit the '07 BMW R1200RT. Ok, it fits the battery hole, but the OE battery hold-down does not fit this battery. I bent it to make it shorter and it seems to be keeping the battery still. Plus, if you dont read up about this battery you will get it then have to order the posts for the top of it. If you order the posts pictured you will have to flatten out your OE bent cable ends and drill the holes larger to make it work. Overall Im not satisfied. We'll see if the battery lasts as well as others have said."
4,Awesome replacement,"I had a buscher racing mini battery that was failing on me and replaced it with this one. My only ""complaint"" just like everyone else is that it doesn't come with terminals. What battery doesn't come with terminals??? at least stock/default ones even if it's for multi use... come on. Luckily i just used the terminals off my old battery and they fit perfect.Starts my car just fine and hasn't hiccupped yet. (only a week old)"
3,NO TERMINALS!,Nothing wrong with the battery per se but there are no terminals included as are shown in the picture. Had to spend $15 for those (plus the hassle of waiting) and the same unit is available elsewhere with terminals for the same price.
4,if used in a car....,"The threaded holes on top are smaller than normalcar batteries. If you want to hook it up to car thathas battery cables with the normal post type clamps, be sure to order the brass posts shown with theunit. The posts they sell at the auto stores have alarger bolt connector and wont fit."
5,The best,More storage power for a lot less money. Package contained the new battery and all the connectors necessary to install the battery into my BMW/K1200LT. AAAA+++
4,Buy it! You won't be disappointed.,"What an amazing discovery..had never heard of these guys before reading the article in HM (July/Aug '99 issue). Bought this CD and now I have to go find their other two albums.Heavy...love it! If you like Precious Death or Galactic Cowboys, you'll love these guys.Lyrically awesome!Keep on rockin'."
4,"Although short, this EP pax some power.","You get a wide variety of music in just 5 songs when you pick up ""My Daddy Can Whip Your Daddy"" by Disciple. The first track sounds like techno meets Rage Against the Machine and by the time this too short CD ends you get a taste of Alice and Chains, 80's rock, humor, and maybe a hair of Stuck Mojo. Even though this EP is a good value, get ready to lick you chops at the full length album released mid-summer '99"
1,This game is not compatible,"Despite what the cover says, this game does not work. It plays, but can not actually be played. I can access the menu options just fine, but there is no way to control the character."
2,Weak stream and the cap is a total pain,"This can seems to ""piddle"" the gas out or fire it out, not much in between. The cap design is absolutely horrible. The little yellow cap is difficult to click into place and unless it is REALLY on there then it fall off with the slightest bump when you are moving it around. The idea for this can is great but the cap and spout need a fast redesign."
3,Solid gas can,I have three of these and love them. I use them to fill a mower and the builting handles make them pretty easy to use. I have never had an issue with them spilling.I would not buy though if you intended to use them to fill up an auto.
3,They're ok,Could do with longer spouts - any idea how hard it is to find a funnel that'll fit a car petrol filler at less than a million dollars?Also I'd prefer a separate air intake cap but beggars can't be choosers eh?
1,"Awful, disgusting versions of fantastic songs","Let me tell you one thing: jazz and Russian music just don't mix very well.. The motives of the person who decided to record these crude jazzy versions of old Russian songs with drunken ""live"" choir in the background will forever be beyond me; overall, the whole CD sounds like Soviet 60's pop-music..In any case, if you want jazz, stick with American masters.. if you want old Russian melodies, by all means avoid this CD."
1,Disgusting!,"I bought this CD a couple years ago and rue the day that I spent the money on it. The music sounds like that played at a 2nd rate circus from the 50's, or that in a beer hall. If you like this type of cheezy music, then by all means get it. Otherwise, look for another Russian music CD."
1,Buy Kenda Tires instead,"I just got a pair of these Cheng Shin tires for a Schwinn Breeze 3-speed and they are the worst! They absolutely will not mount properly. The bead will not sit right so they are, no matter what we do, lopsided. I got a set of Kenda's 26 x 1 1/4 tires, on the other hand, and they are very good for the money.By the way, I'm not just ragging on Cheng Shin tires. I have a set Cheng Shin tires for my 27"" Schwinn and I love 'em. It's just the 26 x 1 1/4 one that suck."
5,I got two words,"The La's. Oh you have to love it. Well okay there's more than The La's influences too, and ""The Greatest Thing"" ooozes romance, but you should check it for yourself."
5,I gots to have me cherry,"If you could have only 1 CD in your collection, the original reace nasty e.p. would have to be it, but that CD was only available for purchase at shows while The Situation was on tour in Europe. (That EP and Free Joe Castro t-shirts are now bringing in big bucks from online auction sites.) But if you can't have that CD, don't worry. This recently released version is better than the original with a new recording of Why I Can't Relate and a 6th hidden bonus live version of Cherry. This CD is worth buying. The Situation has a unique sound that is addictive and much more original than the majority of the crap playing on the radio today. FREE JOE CASTRO!!!!!"
1,Bad Video Quality and Irritating Music,This would have been an interesting historical film except for 2 main items. 1) The video quality is very sub-standard. 2) The music is the background is very annoying. At one point there was actual clapping that was not edited out that took place following a music performance. Please do not waste you time or money.
1,Preview is worthless,Don't bother to watch the Preview; it spends two minutes displaying the movie titles and two shots of letters. If that is what the movie is made of forget the whole thing.
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this software because it advertised ""90 Forms on one CD."" This is very deceptive. When I think of forms on software, I think of having the ability to fill in the blanks, just as I would be able to do with paper forms. However, the forms are buried in 3 different electronic books in pdf format. I had to cut and paste the text and even then it did not paste easily and I had to recreate much of the ""forms."" I was expecting something like a will builder - powerful software (again, expected for the money) that would guide me through the process of creating a will. I could have done the research online for free or gone to the library and checked out a book and gotten the same information."
4,pretty good,This vhs was a very well defined video that helps out in ways you would never understand unless you bought it yourself. It made my chest and abs toned like they've never been. I just want to say that this tape has made me the man I wanted to be. Not to mention how much my dating life has gone up. I really appreciate what the instructor did for me. You should at least try this out. It works!
1,BIBLE SONGS,"THESE SONGS WERE A BIG HELPFOR THIS FIRST YEAR SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER. SOME SONGS WERE EASY AND SOME WERE HARDER, THE EASY ONES WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO GET STARTED."
5,Very Warm Music!!,"I love this CD for my child! She is only 5 mos old but when I sing to her it seems to calm her so I bought this CD for in the car and at home and she loves it! She coos at it and smiles! I think she loves hearing the children's voices! It has a great selection of songs, it reminds me of when I was a kid at Sunday School!"
3,Not as good as Sunday School songs,"The songs on this particular cd seem to have been written for a musical. They're very...I don't know...gimmicky? The jazzy piano, the dramatic volume changes, even the lyrics. In Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho, the last line goes ""And the walls come tumbling....pause pause pause...dowwwwwwn"" and you can sort of see these kids waving their hands in a musical dance sort of way. It's sort of annoying. My daughter (3) enjoys them but the lyrics on some are a bit too advanced (some quote directly from the old testament) and sung too quickly for her to get the lyrics herself. I highly recommend Sunday School Songs, also from Cedarmont kids...it has simpler tunes and well-articulated lyrics, and she was able to memorize the lyrics to those herself pretty quickly."
5,Bible Songs,"Love the CD's. Had these for my kids, so I got them for my grandkids and they just love singing along!"
5,La mejor manera de recordar o de conocer al Padre Tardif,"Tuve el privilegio de participar a encuentros del Padre Tardif, y fui testigo de varias sanaciones que ocurieron en estos encuentros, incluyendo a mi esposa que fué sanada de epilepsia.Pero lo más importante con el Padre Emiliano Tardif no son tantas las sanaciones pero la fuerza del mensaje evangélico: a saber que Jesús esta siempre vivo.El libro de María Sangiovanni es el mejor libro para recordar o aprender a conocer la obra de evangelización del Padre Tardif. Un libro que van a léer más de una vez! y que puede reanimar su fé y su vida.Jean-Pierre Demets"
5,Good,Awesome heart and lots of good souls in this book.It has a real world topic in this book.Enjoyed this book!
1,read first prior to children reading,"My daughter read this book while in fifth grade- The content matter is not appropriate for a young middle school child. Though unfortunately it may be reality for some children, it is not what you want your child to ever experience nor think that it is a ""normal life."" Drugs and violence (particularly bad relationships and physical abuse) should not be tolerated or accepted. This book should be read with a parent or counselor to explain this to children. The actual reading level is low, and the content is not appropriate for young readers."
3,"Easy install, a good value (but not excellent)","I run an atx mobo in this case, and the install was not tough. It's not a large case, and it's not cramped either. Fairly good construction without too many sharp edges. The HDD quickmounts were pretty straightforward and secure.It's nice clean case with a side fan port."
2,Great Case when everything works,"One of the best inexpensive cases out there, when everything works the way it should be...However in my case the Power LED did not work which is not a big deal, but Front Audio Headphone connector is defective lets out too much high pitched static noice, and Front USB connector stopped working on second day.If not for the above problems would have given it five stars.It is a very sturdy case, looks very nice, quiet, no sharp edges."
4,A good functional PC case for the money.,"The overall design is good, with the cooling ventilation extending across the front of the PC case from top to bottom with drives being the only restriction.I suggest using a vacuum cleaner to clean the front vent filters as needed.It is an excellent case for a warm environment.Concerns and praises:- watch out for the sharp edge on the back of the motherboard plate.-The rear 120mm fan is quiet. The front 80mm fan is quiet when out of the case. However, it is the source of excessive noise when installed due to air restriction caused by the case design.My solution was to disconnect the front fan and install a quiet Thermaltake HDD cooler fan A2476.- the rear I/O connector plate did not match up with my MSI K8N Neo4 motherboard connections. I had to replace it.Otherwise, the other features, cabling, mounting hardware worked as designed."
2,Poorly Built Case,"I found this case aesthetically pleasing, but it's very flimsy and poorly built. The tool-less features inside were prone to breaking. On the outside, one of my USB ports broke. I am not hard on my computers and this is the first time something like that has happened out of the countless computers I've built and bought.I wouldn't suggest buying this case."
2,The German Beer Garden,"Not as advertized, On the tape cassette which I happen to have, the music is continuous, but on the CD recording there are brief pauses which aren't always between the end of one song and the beginning of the one that followis. I won't return it in that it was inexpensive to begin with and the cost of postage would exceed what I originally for it."
5,Not for the little ones,"Wonderfully read by Alan Cumming, with the typical Dahl sense of humor, cruel as usual, but very funny. In case your kids are fed up with the happy endings of fairy tales, this is just the right CD to give to them."
3,"Love Roald Dahl, but this is not for young children.","I knew little beforehand about Revolting Rhymes and Dirty Beasts. Being a huge fan of Roald Dahl, it sounded great. I was listening to it before letting students listen to it, and regrettably, I don't think I will be letting students listen to it. There are some words, while probably fine several years ago, are not appropriate anymore. While I love the rhymes in these stories myself, my students will not be hearing them."
4,Is Punk Dead?,"These guys were combining punk with funk way befor the Chili Peppers and Rage, and Tom Morrello gives their guitar sound props for influencing him. The lyrics are anti-establishment but the music is pro-boogie."
1,WARNING: NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS,I've listened to the sound clips for this CD and they sure don't sound like the original artists to me. You'll note that there is no description of this album posted by Amazon. Caveat emptor!!
1,WOW!! THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!!!!,"I give this movie 1 star for the fact that im a fan of Corey Feldman. His names on the cover of this garbage, yet hes in the actual movie for less then 2 minutes. This junk is 90 minutes of fake alien news casts strung together to tell the story. Very Lame. Do not buy. You will be dissapointed. Youve been warned!!!"
1,Sloppy subtitles ruin everything!!!,The movie was supposed to be a marvellous horror from Brazil. Yet mediocre subtitles -- very small whitish letters -- manage to ruins all the joy I could have from watching this movie. The picture transfer was another failure; it's just like the manufacturer transferred it from a VHS source. Avoid this lame DVD at all cost.
5,"Life changing, soul saving, heart tugging.","Randalls' piano connects me to my soul from the first note onward. His melodys are like mantras that take me to my place of power whenever I need a serious battery charge. ""Flutterbys"" came into my life at the same time as M.Scott Pecks, ""The Road Less Traveled"". Between that book and ""Flutterbys"" I had the catalist I needed to begin healing from nearly forty years of disfunction.Need some angelic companionship in your life? ""Flutterbys"" will invite them in a New York minute."
2,Typical Huffy,Low quality that out of the box didn't ride right. Never could get brakes or gearing to work properly. Rusting on all exposed chrome areas. Spend the extra money and buy a Schwinn. I should have done that originally.
4,"Great Bike, if you know someone who can assemble it!","Great bike to ride in! just took me couple weeks to assemble completely, since I have no clue how to do it myself.But after bringing the bike to a specialized ""bike mechanic"" it turns out a great buy!"
5,Exactly As Pictured,"The Rocking Rhythm bag is exactly as pictured. What you probably wouldn't know is how WELL everything is packaged. All of the instruments were neatly placed into labeled, individual bags..this was quite impressive. I'm very pleased with the delivery of the items as well as overall product quality. My 3 and 6-year old really enjoy playing with the instruments and are quite intrigued with them. I was skeptical due to the pricing of the set, but I took a chance...I'm very pleased with my purchase and will most likely order more as gifts."
4,Good starter set of musical instruments,"We got this set of musical instruments for our baby when he was 6 months old. He's still too young for some of the instruments, but he enjoys playing with the two sets of bells and the maracas a lot. We play his music CDs and let him ""jam"" along with his instruments. He really enjoys it! As he gets older, I think he'll enjoy adding more of the instruments to his repertoire. :) They all seem to be of good quality."
4,made the party,"just a party in a bag, I got three bags and give me 24 new toys to make a nice simple party.."
2,"Not worth the price. Nice variety, though!","Triangle is great. Woodblock thing is great. Sandpaper thing is useless, gets pieces of itself everywhere. Castanet thing is alright. Sticks are sticks. Maracas are OK. Bells are fine. It's not worth $20. Maybe $8? If you are using this for kids, then great! you have a variety of toys to inspire their creativity. If you want to use these for actual music, even in a casual way, I wouldn't get this. I bought it for my New Orleans Street Band, and it's been alright. Nothing has fallen apart."
4,great set,love this set. simple and easy to use. 8 different instruments for this price is great! not bad quality either.
5,"Fun sounds, shapes and colors for little ones.","The Rockin' Rythm Band has enough sounds, shapes and colors to hold the attention of small children for quite a while. Quality and finish of items is good, looks to be durable enough to last a two year old quite a while. The instruments are packaged in a wooden tray that helps keep the items together in one place. The sounds are clean and accurate in tone, the triangle sound is perfect. Great opportunity for fun parent / grandparent interaction sessions with little ones. Rugged enough for lots of fun interacting with other kids their age."
5,Rhythmn Band set rocks,This is the 2nd band in a bag purchased. It has a great selection of instruments. Great price. Fast shipping. Very child friendly.
1,Don't even think of getting this,"I'm the first to review this product, so I guess I am the only bargain hunter who's foolish enough to rely on the generally perceived good reputation of Oneida. This set is probably the worst flatware ever manufactured by Oneida. It's so flimsy, even the knives are so thin (my plastic knives are even thicker than these). You'll be embarrassed to use this with your guests. I just received this set today and I'm going to return them first thing tomorrow.I ordered another one which turned out to be a much better deal -- Oneida Satin Flight 53-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Set, Service for 8."
4,Basic air drill for a good price,"We use this drill for driving 3/4"" - 2-1/2"" screws for trailer production, as well as drilling holes (<1/4"") in < 3/16"" steel. It has held up well and offers a handy keyless chuck. The only drawback is how loose the Forward and Reverse toggle is. I find myself pushing it back into position on a regular basis. Although this is a little inconvenient, it does not affect drill performance."
2,Where's [the] Gore?,"A biography of Anais Nin without a single mention of Gore Vidal!Noel Riley Fitch, in his ANAIS: THE EROTIC LIFE OF ANAIS NIN, devotes a whole subchapter to Vidal. Though why Fitch writes a biography in the present tense is beyond me. This is as silly an approach as Beverly Lowry's in her biography of Madame C. J. Walker, HER DREAM OF DREAMS. Biographies are history, not fantasy. The lives of the dead have happened, are not happening as we read or as their biographers write. Please!Better yet, read, Fred Kaplan's biography of Vidal and get more of Nin then Fitch gives us of Vidal."
1,boohoo:(,don't have this doll because it's out of stock and i'm trying to get it but i can't find it but i'm hoping i find it somewhere it looks really really cute i dom't know why they stopped making them now i'm stuck with no doll thanks mattel and they say they are the best? hello! they just destroyd my perfect christmas! thanks a lot:( i'm really mad with mattel and if they read this i hpe they make more dolls!!
5,Beautiful,"These underwear are simply beautiful and intricate. Very comfortable, and the large size is finally up to par."
3,Good general stuff,"I found this book to be helpful in presenting a large overview of what will grow in my state - often a tricky place for transplanted gardeners! I'm no professional, but I am trying to find plants that are supposed to do well in my area instead of using plants with which I might be more familiar. I turned to the MacCubbin/Tasker book because it offered suggestions for all the ""micro-climates"" in my yard in addition to telling me whether or not something was better suited to areas more to my north or south. I have been able to use this book to plan my landscape using plants I never might have considered and I know they will thrive without extra fuss."
4,I wish there were more,"The first thing I have to say about this book is that I wish it were more comprehensive. I moved to Florida from the north, and find the book an excellent reference. The pictures are wonderful, and only a few plants do not have them. I especially find the sections on ""companion planting and design"" and ""regional advice and care"" helpful. The book is well-organized into sections on trees, perennials, tropical plants, vines, etc. The drawback is that the book refers to plants that are not included, which leaves me searching for another reference to find out the appearance and habitat of that plant. Overall, an excellent place to start. Sam's Club has it at a great price."
2,Good for zones 9-11,"As someone that lives in Gainesville, this book was a bust for me. Almost all of the plants in this book are for zones 9-11. If you live in zone 8 you are really out of luck. Many, Many of the plants won't do well in zone 9 also. Luckily I was given this book but I will try to find someone down south that might get more use out of it."
4,"Okay, so it's not the best...","My main problem with this book was that it didn't have a lot of page-turning material in it. Other than that, it was GREAT! It really showed how the Indians lived, and their views on different things. I found it a little annoying that he didn't miss his family as much as I thought he would. But still, I recommend this book to anyone interested in Indian culture but don't want to read through textbooks."
5,Fairy Tales with a new twist,"Emma Donoghue is an accomplished novelist, but this is a reworking of traditional fairy tales. What a delightful read this book is. it is quite a slight volume and each tale transitions into the next. I think her idea was to revamp Traditional tales with a feminist and very individualistic twist and she succeeds spectacularly. It find this authors writing lyrical and original. I consumed this volume in a couple of sittings. Recommended to anyone who enjoys quality storytelling."
5,Bewitching!,"This book was simply enchanting! How refreshing to read these old fairy tales retold from a modern woman's point of view. I have to agree with a former reviewer that it was nice NOT to read, ""And they lived happily ever after,"" at the end of these tales. I particularly enjoyed the interconnectedness of the stories---the way one flowed into the next. A beautiful, mind-expanding book that should be read by everywoman."
3,Original perspective for the lover of fairy tales,"An original twist on 13 of Grimm's fairy tales. Some of the stories were somewhat disturbing, others every bit as grim as the original Grimm. Each will make you think and reflect upon its outcome."
2,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was expecting more. I did not enjoy this book of short stories. It was dark, and somewhat redundant. I was disappointed in it as a whole."
5,The Fighting Marlows,Shirley did a fantastic job in writing this book. In the Fighting Marlows he mentions Marshal George A. Knight Sr. and in reading the parts about Knight I recognized my husbands personality. He is the great grandson of George A. Knight Sr. He and other characters came alive for me and I really enjoyed the book.
4,the book was good for doing research on violence,"the book was very good . i was doing a research project on violence in our world . the book was very helpful . it really went into detail on what i needed. im only in seventh grade but i love to read books. the book was very helpful, i let my teacher read the book and she was very satisfied with the book.the project went on to the county and won 3rd place .im so glad i read the book."
1,The Ice has melted,Ice Cube is a Rap Legend Period.but his recordings after 92 have just gotten worse&worse.I'm tired of Hearing Cube just getting by with 2nd Rate Tracks.you get a song hear&their that sounds Familiar to his Peak but other than that it's Melted ICE.He Lost his edge.
2,Weak For Ice Cube,"This album has a few good songs. What happen to Ice Cube? Has the things he was so against, taken his soul. This is whole lot better than the WaR Disc but what does that say about this as a double disc- It SUCKS. Where's the old CUbe, Where's K-DEE? F@ck Mr. short Khop. I weep for this OnE, it's so studio, it is riddiculous. Weak for Ice Cube, listen to Amerikkka's Most, Death Certificate and Westside Connection album to regain your skills. ONE"
2,Sorry Cube,"When I first put this CD in the deck, ""Hello"" got me real excited. Unfortunately, the rest of the disc did not hold up. Sure ""You can do it"" is great, but the rest of the album seemed to fall off a bit. I still like every other album, from ""Amerikkka's Most Wanted"" to ""Lethal Injection"" to ""War"" as well as those in between, but the one bright spot was hearing a sneak preview of what N.W.A has in store."
4,cubes hangin,"I thought the cd was off the hook,the beats were wack and tha way it was put together was dope thanx cube 4 keepin it real"
3,"Ice Cube's ""peace"" disc...","sounds more like a calmer cube than the ""war"" disc, and everything else before that. I rated this cd 3 stars because I'm a big fan of Cube's work since the n.w.a. projects as well as his solo stuff, westside connection, etc. I took off two stars because the production on a lot of the tracks could've been better. It's still a good buy to add to your collections & cd changers. I wish cube much success on his Lp, and hopefully we can expect some raw & roughness on the new n.w.a. cd along with the rest of the gang. Keep on representin' fo the west coast. Peace Out & God Bless."
3,"Tight Album, but Cube can do better","If this album would have come out orginally in 1998 than I think it would be a classic. Cube has dropped tight remixes of We be Clubbin and Pushin Weight with DMX and Noreaga and he even did a NWA track and a Westside Connection track. If he would have added these this album would probably be better than War. This album come off being rushed, but it still has some banging tracks. check out 1,4,8,12. Can't wait until WSCG and NWA. Another solid album from the WESTSIDE!"
5,A Little More War!,"This disc opens with one of the biggest tracks in rap history. And after that it has some of the best beats and samples I've hear since PE's last. ""Gotta Be Insanity"" has Puffy all over it. And with guests like Dre, Ren, Mac 10, Jay Felony, and Chris Rock how can you go wrong? You can't! BUY THIS CD!"
3,the sequel to the vol 1 war disc,dre makes a good appearance on this one which makes all happy. no more beef. cube doesn't slouch on this one.
1,A Foul Display!,"Words cannot describe my disgust when I listen to this CD! I tried to get atleast one song out of it, but couldnt, WHAT happened to Oshea Jackson? Mr. Natural Born Killah, seek the Doctors help ( he does wonders, yo!) Its not like hes a garbage MC, Im not saying that, its just that this CD is....... Bust it, I'll never make this mistake again, I mean What the F@CK, people pay good money for these CDs, not for it to be a BOOTLEG product! Im saying its the worst CD I bought in this millenium! A FOUL DISPLAY! ...FOUL! ... Peace to Devestator!"
4,"WAR & PEACE, VOL.2","ICE CUBE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST RAPPERS OF ALL TIME. I KOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS OF BIGGIE, BUT THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT FROM THE WEST COAST! SO RECOGNIZE PUNK.!"
2,"The ""Ice"" Age","This is for all you that have only been listening to rap for a couple of years. Do not judge Ice Cube's abilities on his past couple albums. To appreciate him, go back to albums like ""Death Certificate"" , ""Predator"" and ""AMW"". I respect Ice Cube as an actor and as an artist, but his last couple attempts at gaining the stature he once had have come empty handed. This album is tired."
2,Garbage,"This cd isnt as good as his old skool stuff, this cd is more like r&b music without that powerful rap feeling as in cds before. get death certificate, its a better cd than this"
5,Cube is still great.,"CUbe is still one of the greatest! Sure this album is not like Death Certificate, but he isn't trying to make another Death Cerficate. With that said, I love the whole mood of this album; it is calm, entertaining and insightful. ""Until We Filthy Rich"" gives knowledege to young kids and ""Record Co. Pimpin"" schools young Mcs. ""Hellow"" and ""The Gutter"" are hella tight. ""The whole album is good. ""Lie To Kick It"" and ""Roll All Day"" are funny cuts. ""Supreme Hustle"" is phat. The only weak song to me is ""U Can Do It,"" but even that song is better than half of the stuff out there now. Cube will always be here, whether people like him or not because he does not stay in one place musically. He elevates, as it should be. The album is a must have for any fan of good hip hop."
2,Huge disappointment if you liked Vol 1 (The War Disc),"Wow, all I can say is this album was a huge let-down. I purchased this album, all tracks unheard, strictly on the strength of Vol 1 (The War Disc). What happened? This album is full of recycled beats that we've heard so many times before, party/dance tracks that just don't work with Cube's authoritative lyrical flow, and a load of stupid insert tracks. Don't waste your money. If you have Vol 1 (The War Disc), trust me, you don't need or want this."
2,Worst By Him Ever,"This is Ice Cube's worst album that I've ever heard from him, it is just terrible. ""You Can Do It"" w/Mack 10 & Ms.Toi is the best song on here, but I bought the Next Friday soundtrack and the hype of that cut wore up before I even bought this album. Plus it wasn't really all that great to begin with. ""Hello"" w/Dr. Dre & MC Ren is the next tightest. MC Ren is back and badder then ever, you watch out for him on his next solo album CPT 2000 and on the new NWA due out soon. And the jam with Krayzie Bone is good too. But besides that this album is just plain weak, so don't get it. He has about 7 better albums out that you should buy first."
3,Ice Cubes begining to melt,"Cube has proved himself again, since he came out with the awful war disc back in '98 but its not enough. I always thought he was the best rapper n lyriscist in N.W.A, spittin out madd rhymes about rascism and cali that were dead on, but in the peace disc he repeats himself, running out of stories and points to tell. sure theres the odd dope song like ""nigga of the century"", ""hello"", and ""until we rich"". but cubes tracks r becoming too listener friendly, 3 cuts off the album can already be found on the radio. It bothers me when I buy a cd n all the tight tracks can be found on the radio. Its like, why did i waste cash on this when I could just tape the songs instead. But the fifteen dollars i spent was so worth it just to hear Mc ren, dre and cube all together again, though if I were you I'd just wait for the N.W.A disc to come out."
3,"YEAH, YEAH!","I have to mention at first I wasn't feelin' Cube. I thought he just be one of those artists I'd never feel. Why's he always yellin? Then it kinda grew on me. This album is why. Tracks 1,4,5,7,8 are the best on the CD, with Hello being the best along with you can do it. The second half, his style gets kinda annoying, but not as annoying as Eminems. Don't buy this though if you can't stand a whole lot of talk about nothing, and west coast gangsta rap. Other than that, you should love it."
4,More fun now!,"I still have the original LP-yes vinyl! I was forced to buy the CD after my failure to find anything I could download besides ""Monster."" I'm glad I did.This disc is loaded with great dance tracks, laugh-out-loud lyrics-check out ""Summer In Hell""- and one of the most unlikely duets imaginable, Fred Schneider & Patti LaBelle.A good purchase, especially for B-52 fans."
3,Not exactly the same!,"This album originally came out in 1984 with the title ""Fred Schneider & The Shake Society"". It is now labeled ""Fred Schneider"". Five of the nine tracks have been remastered and it greatly improves this album. The B-52's Kate Pierson also sings on this album, as does Patti Labelle."
2,Poor quality sound due to lack of a quality size ensemble.,"Diversity of titles were quite good however selection #2 National Emblem is missing although listed on the back of CD case and on front of disc. Sound quality of most selections was poor, i.e. tinny, brassy and with no depth due to lack of full complement of instruments (baritnone horns, tuba, bass woodwinds etc.). Sound quality is ""ZERO"". My guess is that tere were no more than 10 - 15 musicians playing on most cuts."
1,No Name album to protect the guilty,Mislabeled tracks and no notes make me sorry that I bought this CD. If I could find out who made it I would send it to them and never buy anything they made.
2,Brazil Boom Boom,The quality and content was not worth the money spent. A couple of guys with a regular CAMCORDER driving around Rio and shooting video of the local attaraction without real professional input.Will not buy anything from these guys again.
1,Don't waste your money,"This DVD is a huge waste of money. The whole thing is poorly put together: bad music and worse girls. Just take a look at what the cover offers -- one word, BUSTED. The first two Hip Hop Honeys DVDs justified their purchase ... this one sucks!"
2,Mediocre,"A lot of repeat shots, half shots and bad angle shots. Would have like to see more full frontal shots. Found it uninteresting and dull."
3,good eye candy but missing,i liked the vibe but this one wasn't quite as good as the other one.I was all sparked&ready to be feeling the same vibe as i did with the first one but this one was a bit of a let down but still Entertaining.
1,Garbage!,"The worst DVD i have ever seen! They show more in Rap videos! Its a joke! The girls are all real light, small chests and some butts! Thas IT! They barely show their chests! This movie is horrible!"
4,Beauitful and Wonderful Quality,I love Nordic Ware. And this pan does not dissapoint. It's perfect for dinner parties amd the portable tray is so great to carry all your beauitful cakes. Nordic Ware is well worth the money.
1,extremely disappointing,"I'm an admirer of Barrington Watson's art and was really hoping to find a book containing some of his great paintings of caribbean subject matter. Instead I get stuck with a book of strange stories and mediocre paintings of europeans wearing bed clothes and top hats and that sort of thing. There were one or two images I enjoyed in the book but apart from that there was very little that held my interest. Watson is perhaps the most well known West Indian painter yet it seems he has no interest in identifying himself with that wonderful region, at least according to the pieces selected for this book. Mr. Watson has painted some of the finest images of caribbean life and I wish I could find a book that contained those paintings."
5,Lean Treats are my dogs favorites!!,"I got a bag of Lean Treats for my dog at his last visit to his Vet and he loved them. He was hooked. The bag said available only from Veterinarians, not so, I found them on Amazon. I bought more and my dog is in gluttony heaven now. He actually shakes all over when I pick up the bag to give him one. Giving him his pills is no problem now since the treats are soft and a pill can be pushed into it and it's down his throat before he can taste his meds."
5,Very good treat for your dogs,I am dog trainer and I use these a lot. My vet is the one who told me about them. They are good treats (not junk) and they are soft and easy to use for training and for giving medications.
5,DOG LOVES THEM,"OUR DOG LOVES THEM, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. HE SEARCHES HIS BOWL FOR THESE WHEN WE HIDE THEM IN HIS FOOD."
5,Butler lean treats,"Excellent transaction, quick/easy service. Would recommend this to anyone who is watching their pet's weight."
5,Jstockton,"My puppy loves them! She's a corgi so we worry about her gaining weight, but still wanted to teach her tricks using treats. These work out great, we can break one piece into about 5 other smaller pieces, so we only use about 1 or 2 full pieces per training session."
1,Informative but Labored,"Mr. Goldberg obviously worked and worked at this book. It is chock full of information, some of it now dated. But mainly, one can see the seams, the labor in the writing, which makes for labored reading. Not recommended."
3,"Detailed, but flawed.","Goldberg has produced an excellent book explaining why Jews often think the way they do with regards to politics. Still, after explaining in minute detail, he fails to truly explain the power of false charges of anti-semetism. The most notorious example is that of the A.D.L. and their constant smear tactics of those who don't gobble down the Israeli party line. He has also failed to explain some of the criminal elements within that organization, tracing back many years now. Otherwise, the book is very solid. He should have tried to stop explaining away Jewish power in places where Jews carry unprecedented weight, especially when it comes to fund raising and race relations. If you can forgive this and his failure to cover the A.D.L. properly, it is a worthy read."
2,Doesn't last very long,"I purchased this for the Cold Cranking Amps to power my big bore Harley. I had it for 3 months before it died, then replaced it with the same model battery and it also lasted 3 months. Every time I started my bike it took to much power out of it and then took to long to recharge until they just wouldn't hold a charge anymore. For stock applications It would most likely work fine but it is billed as a heavy duty battery and it fails. You can actually measure the decrease in cold cranking amps after every start. Once a Week I would measure it and watched the life just tick away"
1,shipped wrong battery,"The battery shown in the image is a metal clad Odyssey pc545 with the UBC code of 043cs031700485. I ordered this item because it was metal clad. This battery will be used in an off road application and I want a durable case. I received the shipment in a very timely fashion(the next day)but it was the unclad version with a different UBC code, 0572d090620065. This item is supposedly non-returnable. I contacted Amazon.com customer service by e-mail and am waiting for a responce.Odyssey PC545 Powersports Battery"
5,University Purpose,"This item is for the connection to a University wireless system, and this particuler unit was required."
4,"Fine, but do you really need A?","I purchased this card to complement my WRT55AG, dual-band router. I've not had particularly good luck connecting in A mode; in fact, I rarely use it because it's unable to maintain a solid connection. I don't know if this is the hardware or just life with ""A"", but I would not recommend using it in a residential setting. Save the bucks, stick with G/B.On the other hand, I""ve had no problems connecting to G (which I use at home) or B (on the road). The supplied software is pretty good for helping identify and select new networks, though it does take a few minutes to switch to a new network.Summary: unless you have a compelling reason, just stick with B/G."
3,Kindle Version of C.R.E.P,"This is a good concise book. It certainly containsincredible information for a quick reference and it also gives recommended readings which is important for a deeper understanding. One terrible setback for anyoneusing a reference book like this -- There are nokindle page numbers and you can't (efficiently) use the normal alternative which is to search for a philosopher's name. For example, I tried looking up Aristotle as a subject but as he was such an influence on so many other thinkers, there is an interminable list of Aristotles, none of which give a clue to whether the location you select is the one discussing him solely and his life. You can imagine how long it takes to look up someone and attain the specifics you want."
1,Not True to Advertised Review,I was looking for a waterproof compact binocular for my dream trip cruise to Alaska. Upon reading the review this item seemed to be perfect. NOT!!!! Using them for the very first time while on the cruise to whale watch during a very light drizzle the right side fogged over completely and vapor was on the inside of the lens. Disgusting to say the least.Then when I returned home and checked the warranty to return them is a joke. They charge you for shipping and must include a $20.00 check for repairs. This was a $29.99 purchase and I'm expected to pay more to fix them?So what I purchased is now considered JUNK!!!My recommendation is if you are going on a cruise such as this. They sell very nice binoculars on the ship at very reasonable price. Plus there is no shipping fee or taxes paid on the purchase.
3,Eh. Not much better than my eyes.,"I bought these for a trip to Costa Rica. They are certainly compact and lightweight, but they don't really work very well. They take a while to focus, and are difficult to use in highly wooded areas (i.e. for bird/nature watching). The sight is pretty small too. In hindsight, I'd rather spend more money and get a little better pair."
2,"OK, but should have gotten a higher quality set.","They work ""OK,"" but a bit cloudy on one side and a bit touchy to focus. They were really inexpensive, so ya get what ya pay for, but in the future, I'm sticking with German, Austrian, US, or the like instead of made in China. In my opinion, a solid set of binoculars should last a lifetime, not 6 months. (Costs less to buy a great pair once instead of poor ones every year, right?!)"
3,Barska Blackhawk 12 x 25 WP Binocular,"These are average binoculars with average optics suitable for occasional binocular users who don't have high expectations. Given that they are advertised as having fully multicoated optics and BAK4 prisms, I had hoped for better quality. But, heck, they're inexpensive and my grandkids have a ball with them. For far better optics I recommend the Nikon Travelite V binoculars for around $100. They're lighter and superior in every way."
5,Flutterbys,"This is a rare artist, all jesting aside, who is a concert pianist of grand proportions, but is only linked in New Age Music. This piece is not only uplifting, but, alas!, it is NEW, Different, alliterating and ambrosia all at once! I have all the original cassettes of his music and cherish each!What this music does for the human spirit is inexplicably rise them to a higher plain where sometimes you can hear the angels sing!I'm not a New Ager, far from it, but I know what is good and fresh and Randall Leonard is it! He is a truly innovative composer who bears watching and who could just be the one who writes the music that is truly a gift from heaven!Flutterbys reminds me of the trials of life and than lifts me higher and makes me smile at the things that are really important!This artist belongs in Carnegie Hall or playing with one of the wonderful artists who truly raise their voices to Heaven."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Very unhappy! Just got this in, no box, no case, plain plastic bag. Had to force batteries in, then the LED doesn't turn. The image is way too shaky to see IF you can even get it to focus at all. Not worth the postage to send it back...Caveat Emptor!"
4,Great for the money.,"This is definitely worth the money. It takes a little getting used to if what you are viewing is not perfectly flat, but by bracing the solid side of the viewing lens on the bridge of you nose and keeping you viewing eye back just a little you can see quite well, then adjust the focus or move your subject closer or further to the port on the bottom."
2,Tiny View,This was for my four year old nephew and he was disappointed. For one you have to know how to keep one eye closed to see anything and even then you have to be exactly on the object and with the exact lighting. It takes a lot of effort. The viewing area is very tiny. Then again the price is right so maybe for an older child with patience would be ok.
2,meh...don't bother,"I had one of these when I was a child/teen and was happy when I found this. Even though the design is similar to what I had as a child, the function clearly is not. I had trouble getting the batteries in- the spot is very tight, but I was finally able to jam the batteries in. The switch was very hard to slide to the on position, although this would probably get better with more use. The big problem I have with this is the LED light that is used to illuminate. The one I had as a child used a regular bulb, and you were able to see the items clearly. The LED light casts a purple haze on the items and washes out what you are looking at. I used to love looking at my skin with this toy. Try that with this one and you lose most of the detail and it appears you are looking at an alien's skin....funny I didn't know I had purple alien skin. This item may work for some people or be fine for other uses- but if you have used one of these in the past, you will probably be disappointed."
1,SE Illuminated Pocket Microscope 30x,SE Illuminated Pocket Microscope 30x---This item did not work. There was a blank screen---would like to return it.Anita Lennon
1,junk,I purchased 3 of these for work. They area a poorly re-engineered version of the Micronta I have. The fit and finish of the plastic is poor. The light bulbs shake and don't stay on. One didn't work at all. This is copying at its worst.
2,"Pocket microscope is fun, but quality of this one is shabby.","SE Illuminated Pocket Microscope with White LED LightThis microscope is very intriguing to young and old alike. During the past 30 years I have purchased similar designs as gifts for 5- to 50-year olds. I ordered five of these this year. One arrived with the stitching in the ""leatherette"" case ripped, can't be resewn. Also, in all five microscopes the installation of two AA batteries was next to impossible. The battery compartment is too small. One battery was ""uncapped"" while trying to install. These are cheap copies of the design that I was used to in earlier years (Micronta). It might be worth it to consider spending a bit more for better quality --Carson Micro Max Lighted Microscope"
5,happy,"very prompt, as a matter of fact, they sent it out a lot faster than amazon sent my other order..."
2,"Overpriced, if you can believe it!","I should have known $7 would get me a $2 item. This microscope is poorly constructed. Out of the box the LED refused to turn off! In addition, in about 3 days the focus wheel became loose and I have to hold my finger to stop it from going out of focus. Don't waste your money, swallow hard, and get a $20 or higher unit."
3,pocket microscope,"my husband uses this. it is cheaply made. we've replaced it once already. batteries need more space to replace. if the lightbulb no longer works it can't be replaced, thus why we purchased a new one. yet, while it works, it works great. hope this helps."
1,Cheap has a new standard.,"Cheap housing, cheap optics, cheap light and everything appears inverted. Not even worth a second glance. The only joy came from throwing this against a wall and watching it shatter."
4,"Not The Best, But Outsings The Competition.","Well, Superstar Kidz aren't the best out there. The whole chorus of a million kids in the background gets a little old, the instruments are annoyingly changed, and the C.D.s contain old songs. But on the whole, they are MUCH better than Kidz Bop. At least the million kids singing in the background CAN sing, and the lead singers have got talent too. So, really, not necessarily ""Superstar"" but it's better than the dreaded Bop.L.A."
1,hate it,iam a jump5 fan they tottally stole jump5's song all i can do and runied this cd it's stupid
1,BAD,"I will NEVER buy this CD. I don't know who this Julie Griffin person is, but she stole Jump5's song All I Can Do and absolutely ruined it!"
4,Better than kidz bop!,"This cd is much better than kidz bop! The kids don't sound annoying, the lead singers are great, and some of the kids actually have talent!"
1,Content is not Worth the Cost,"Although this is purportedly written by a teen-ager, it is simple-minded and much more suited for 9-10 year old ADHD children. The problems are those of pre adolescents. As a parent of a 14-year old, I can attest that we have long been over this ground. If your child was diagnosed ADHD back in the early grammer school years, this is old hat for you and your teen-ager. There are no new coping and growing skills for your teen-ager in this book.This paper-backed book is also very overpriced for the content. Five minutes of reading - not much substance. Skip it - there are better ADHD books for your teen agers."
5,Sally's The BEST,"The first time I heard Sally was on a Portland jazz radio station. I was very impressed with what I was hearing, in fact so impressed I called the telephone number that was listed on her web site to get tickets to one of her concerts that was coming up. It was one of the best concerts that I have attended. I love to watch her play, because she gets so into her music. When I listen to Sally play, I go to a whole other world, she makes you forget your troubles. Sally is truly a gifted, gifted musician."
5,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"This is a pretty basic expansion pack; pretty much exactly what you'd expect. It simply makes Settlers of Catan playable by 5-6 players (the original box is for 3-4 players). More players can make the game more fun (more people to trade with and whatnot), but it does make the game longer, which is not a problem for most people."
5,Settlers is better with more people!,My wife and I love being able to play one of our favorite games with more friends. The island fills up a lot faster making it a little more difficult and more challenging for your strategy. Just make sure you mark the pieces that belong to this set so that they don't get mixed up with the orginal 4 players set.
5,Catan is a Winner,"Settlers of Catan adds all the great and fun elements of Monopoly and Risk and possibly ""Craps"" into a group game. You build an empire by gathering resources through dice rolls and trading your resources with others in order to buy more settlements, cities, and roads to expand your potential resource collection. If that doesn't get you wanting to play, then maybe one of your nerdy friends buying the game will do the trick. But trust me, it is worth it and you'll likely be hooked after you play.And on the bright side, a game typically lasts 1-2 hours instead of other ""greats"" like Risk which take 3-4 hours typically."
3,Just ok.,"I don't think Michael Brook will ever equal or better Hybrid. This is an ok album but I was hoping for a little more ""ambience""."
3,"Lovely but ultimately rather meh ambient soundscapes centered around the ""infinite guitar""","Michael Brook gained some buzz in the 1980s for inventing the ""infinite guitar"", a technology which allows individual guitar notes to be held with infinite sustain. In the early 1990s, he recorded a couple of albums for the 4AD label, of which COBALT BLUE was the first. The 12 tracks here are all instrumental, centered around Brook's guitar but with occasionally keyboard contributions from Brian and Roger Eno, and strings from other players. The music is minimalist, based on very basic grooves. Atmosphere is prioritized over any thematic development.Most of the individual tracks here are lovely if taken in isolation. Unfortunately, listening to the album as a whole, the effect is too samey and one wishes for contrast. COBALT BLUE might have worked great as a film score, a genre which Brook has had some success in, but it doesn't provide very memorable home listening."
5,"Excellent follow to Silicon Messiah, a powerhouse!","At first listen I thought the album was not as good as Blaze's powerful first album ""Silicon Messiah"" but after a few listens I am addicted! This album has a lot to offer; musically it is similar to Messiah but has a theme all its own. A good selection of hard-hitting fast tracks as well as melodic slower pieces that work well together to produce a solid album."
4,Blaze churns out more REAL heavy metal,"i got this cd yesterday so i can't give a detailed view of it. THis cd is definately a grower, its unlike SILICON MESSIAH (the first album) in that sense. THis doesn't hit u like SILICON... straight away but its still a great album. Id say the songwriting is as good as before but the guitars dont sound quite as good. Blaze really are a band which sound nothing like anyone else. Sure there are influences in there but they have a unique sound. Its definately old skool but with comtemporary production. True metal fans will appreciate this CD!!!"
2,The Ugly Betty of Carmens,"Carmen is supposed to be a woman of incomparable sensuality who exploits her charms to make men do her bidding--even to kill for her. Although Geraldine Farrar was a popular singer of her time, this is a silent picture where you don't hear her. You only see her. And she is quite ugly and not a great movie actress. When she is first introduced as the legendary Carmen, it is almost comical. She looks old, plain with but two outstanding features--horse teeth and a big nose. Later, her attempts at being a temptress are undeniably ludicrous. How she landed this part will remain a mystery to me. Wallace Reid, on the other hand, is brilliant as always. It's just hard to imagine a young, strapping Reid heartbroken for a woman who looks like she could be his mother. It was like Pierce Brosnan going after Streisand in The Mirror Has Two Faces. I just don't get it."
1,"I GIVE UP ON U, GIRL!!!",BARBIE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO U????!! YOU ARE UN REALISTIC AND TRASHY!!! YEAH I SOW AGREE WITH THE KIDS REVIEW THIS DOLL IS A S-L-U-T DO NOT BUY!!!
4,a review for superheros dolls!,I think this great and very feminem i think this catwoman doll is cool because it looks just like halle berry in that costume and the costume has the same designs it looks like the eacket replica except in a doll size! i think this doll is very fun to play and act out scenes from the movie!
1,Awful,This disgusting for young girls to play with. Ewwww. And we wonder why 10 year olds are dressing the way they do? C'mon moms - this barbie needs to be OFF the market.
3,relax people,"people calm down its just a doll. granted she looks like she has nothing on but still. i don't think this will teach women to be smart or confident so kill that. because when you dress nasty people treat you that way yet its just a doll. halle berry by the way is half black and half white, not that it should matter."
3,Doll Doesn't Look Like HB in the least!,"If you're a collector of the ""Barbie as..."" dolls (e.g. Wonder Woman, Marilyn Monroe, etc.) then this doll will be right up your alley. The people who have gotten the vapors over the doll's outfit need to relax. The doll has more clothes on than any of the beach-themed Barbies, for pity's sake!The costume is a good representation of the one worn by Ms. Berry in the movie. If you wouldn't take your child to see this movie, you shouldn't buy the doll. It's that simple.If you saw the prototype doll on Halle Berry's website (that most definitely looks like her) and were interested in purchasing that, don't get this doll. You'll be disappointed.(What happened, Mattel?)"
5,Bought this for my collection..,I collect African-American barbies and this one was a great addition to what I have so far.
5,awesome,"i absolutely luv this doll except her hair is to thin,she cant sit down,and you cant take her clothes off. other then that shes great!"
4,Do you want lisen beatiful mexican songs? She is the singer,Amalia Mendoza García was one of Mexico's most famous ranchera singers whose career lasted over 40 years. This CD is one of the best that she did.
3,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Sure, the music itself is terrific, but the recording is atrocious. It sounds like it was recorded with one mic from somewhere off to one side of the audience. There are periods where the musicians are barely audible. Very frustrating; digital remastering can't work miracles. This is only for hard-core fans of one or more of the stellar musicians on the lineup - Trane, Cannonball, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb, and of course Miles."
4,Good Glossary,"If you are in the translation business it will help you with troublesome words, strictly in the commercial and business areas. Still, I would have hoped it to be a bit more extensive in definitions. But, then again, it IS just a glossary."
5,The Album That Started It All For Martina...,"Still one of my favorite Martina albums.This is classic Martina!Although this isn't her first album(it's her second) she only started producing hits since this second album, after releasing her famous domestic abuse hit Independence Day, which after 16 years is still her signature song and what a powerful song it is too!!Also other stand outs are the touching ballads That Wasn't Me,her hit Where I Used To Have A Heart(love this song),She Ain't Seen Nothing Yet and Strangers(her vocals are amazing on this). However, there's also some cracking uptempo toe - tapping gems like her hits Life #9,Heart Trouble and My Baby Loves Me.You can never go wrong with a Martina McBride album.You will not be disappointed with this little gem!!"
2,24 Great Favorites Is A Misnomer,"This album gives us 22 vocal and two instrumental Latin arrangements albeit without acclamation. The songs in the second half (except for ""Poeta"") are a let down after the ones in the first dozen. I'd say the title is HALF right but worth the few bucks required."
5,Just perfect!,"These keyboard stickers are fine and got to me in good condition.This was the first time I had gotten any keyboard stickers and the color is bright and stands out nicely.I had been thinking about a way to make typing typing easier for forums and pdfs so they will help me make better posts and make the keyboard as useful as it can be for me, I was hoping they would serve their purpose and make it easier to learn and type and they work nicely.All in all, recommend."
1,THE REAL REALITY,"Although I pretended to be upset by the sex tape, I was the one that sent it to Vivid Entertainment, and they paid me $5 million dollars to expose my nasty self. Ray J had nothing to do with the leaked sex tape. I tricked him into making a porn film with me for distribution. The orgasm is of course fake because that's how they do it in cheap porn films. My former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, knows what happened! I am just waiting for him and many, many more, to come out and reveal how I really am. I exploit my fake body all of the time because I lack intelligence, class, dignity, self-respect, elegance and morals. I am a very dirty woman.Let's get rid of them!! Sign the no more Kardashian petition!!"
2,diappointed,"my wife made me watch the kardashians when it first came out and I admit I liked it right away and we have been watching ever since. naturally we could'nt wait for it to come out on dvd. I could'nt be more disappointed with the dvd because its shown exactly as shown on E. I was looking foward to hearing the exact language and other things they can't show on tv. If I wanted to see it this way, all I have to do is watch the reruns which E shows all the time. I feel like I wasted my money on it!"
4,Fun show w/ a fun family,"Although they don't always get along - hey, what family does? - this is a family that genuinely loves each other. And they're fun to watch. Kimberly is hot. Her sisters are cute, and Bruce is a hoot!One note, the extra episode ""Junk in the Trunk"", which aired at the end of Season 2, is slightly different here than what aired on E!. There are a couple of added segments, but there are also a couple of missing ones too, like the prank the brother plays with his girlfiend on his mom, and Kourtney surprising Khloe w/ info on her acting class partner. Wonder why the changes were made."
5,A fun escape from reality.,"Love 'em or not, if you need an escape from reality, the K K dolls will provide it. So grab your Melon Ball cocktails (or water and lemon), popcorn and sit back and enjoy the antics of the K K gals and the guys who love them. Such fun!"
1,"$40 million dollars, highest paid reality T.V. show in history","Wow, this is what gets $40 million dollars, how sad.. What happened to real T.V.This is not even T.V. this is what it is, poor taste and no creative skills, no integrity to use a good method of influence to show the world morals, values, respect, etc.What ever happened to standards and structure of real T.V."
1,What a dumb show,"Ok, I hate the show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, it's all nothing but 15 minutes of fame & bad publicity stunts on national TV. When I watched it a long time ago, I stopped watching it, this shows sucks!!!!!!! Sorry, I'd rather be watching Power Rangers, anime, The Vampire Diaries, Gossip Girl, & True Blood with actors with REAL talent. I hate this show so much...... :P"
5,First Season Kardashians,It took me a long time before I started watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians and I really like this show!!! So much fun!!!!
4,Looks better on t.v.,"I love the Kardashian sisters! So when the first season came out on dvd, I was ready to own it. But, I was a little disappointed when I started watching it. The quality of it looks horrible. I mean, it looks like a home video. Other than that, I have no problems with it. I just hope the second season has better quality."
1,Don't buy this watch,After purchasing this watch as a replacement for one of my other watch's I kept it in a drawer for a few months before my other watch died. I love watch's with both analog & digital time keeping capabilities. As an EMT I love the second hand on watch's. However after my first watch of 3 years died (a walmart special) I put this one into use. After 11 days I noticed it was broken. Apparently while I was washing my hands the button to set the analog watch fell off and water made it into the watch. For 100 m water resistance it didn't last a simple hand washing let alone anything at depth. Very upset especially after hearing Timex's logo for years. My first and last Timex I will ever buy.
1,Junk watch.,"I have had three of these. everyone of them broke with in 3 months.first one, the digital went wacky and wouldnt work properly any more. i did a walmart exchange in it and got another this one had the analog adjustment pin fall out and fill with water. thinking it was just a fluke, i got yet another one via walmart exchange and again, the adjustment pin fell out.also the plastic adjustment bezel paint flaked off with in 2 weeks on ever one of them ive had. it wasnt a big deal because the color plastic its made of is the same color as the paint, but its still worth notingi love this watch and wanted very desperately for it to be good, but alas, it disappointed me not once, not twice, but 3 times before i finally said screw it and gave up on the exhanges."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this Timex Expedition to replace an Expedition that I've had for 6+ years. My old one was sturdy and surprisingly took more than one bump I never expected. This one lasted less than a week before I broke off the crown (to set the time) when I was simply reaching into the refrigerator. I thought about making a warranty claim, but the apparent impact was just hard enough to scratch the plastic barrier designed to protect it. I couldn't believe it. My last one didn't have the barrier, likely because it didn't need it. Timex has seriously sacrificed quality in pursuit of keeping prices low. I ordered a Casio G-Shock to replace my Timex."
4,Get a new watchband,"Overall this is a good watch. It has a number of useful features - Indiglo, day/date, timers, alarm, 2nd time zone, etc. The bezel moves as well. The case thickness is a bit on the high size - about 13 or 14mm. The watch is very lightweight, so it's only the case thickness that can give you the sensation of it being a bit bulky.One warning, though. You'll want to replace the watchband. The minute I received it, I knew I'd be replacing it. The velcro band that comes with the watch is horrible, uncomfortable, and is not as flexible as you might think. I found a few online sites that sell replacement bands, and found a good sports band at [...] that fits very well, and greatly improved my opinion of this watch."
3,Great features but cheap feel,"I've always been a fan of Timex products and have used them in many different extreme settings without fail. This watch caught my eye because of the rotating bezel, which I find useful for timing. After receiving it, I was pretty dissapointed. The bezel is plastic and is a dull grey, not silver looking and the ratcheting mechanism feels really cheap. Bumping the bezel also caused it to rotate. The band is kind of a thin velcro that looks like a kid's watch. The overall features and the dual analog/digital time are both big bonuses in my eyes, but I couldn't get over the 'feel' of the watch and ended up returning it."
3,Low end Timex,"While Timex does make a very similar watch that has a metal front, this one is ""resin"". It does say it in the product review, but easily overlooked. When I got the watch it seemed pretty cheap looking. It does function well."
5,4 years and in perfect condition,"I purchased this watch because of the ability to keep 3 time zones. I travel globally for a living and need to keep track of different times. This watch is rarely off my wrist, because I wear it at night as a wakeup alarm. It has been through every kind of condition and has never lost a second! I use the indiglo feature constantly, but have only had to change the battery once in 4 years. It is easy to read and operate. I have tried many watches over the years with digital and analog, but this watch has been by far the most rugged and inexpensive! Do not hesitate to buy this watch and wear it on the road, it is dependable!"
3,"Powerful watch, but look bad","I'd like to say it's a powerful watch enough for everyday use. And it's not that big for a man.The weak point is that it's very ""plastic"", which make it like a kids' toy.Update 3/2/2010:Be careful, after wearing it over half a year, I find that the strap made of nylon is not a good material. After you wear it too long and often, (say won't put it off when wash your face), it will become smelly."
3,Short Life,I really like the look of this Expedition watch however it stopped working after 3 months. I changed the battery's but it didn't help. I may buy another one just to see if it can work for a reasonable length of time. Hope so.
3,Great watch,"Bought this one 2 years back. Till date the watch is in perfect condition. The features are working fine.Only issue I faced were following1) The strap plastic holders (attaching strap to watch) broke after an year. I had replaced it with new similar but more stylish one.2) The buttons for light, and settings are bit delicate . i usually wear watch all time even while sleeping so have to be very careful. Once the digital part stopped working. but I reset it and it is working fine now.Other than these it is good buy at this price. Alarm is good enough so is the indiglow feature. Helps to read time in darkest of places.good purchase for college students or people of travel.HK"
3,watch great but directions confusing,"This watch is great and my grandson loves it. But, the directions that came with it are rather ""generic"" and were very hard to understand as related to this specific watch. Still trying to figure out some things. Otherwise, a good value."
1,Lasted 6 months & died,"Velcro band has very small area of contact, so comes undone when swimming.I had this for about 6 months & it died. Only used in the pool, doesn't appear to have any moisture in it, never depressed buttons underwater, doesn't appear to be flooded or have moisture in it.Has features desirable for swimming & diving (SCUBA) such as large, easy to read dial, digital ""back-up (yet again, digital, back-lighting & analog quit all at the same time, so glad this happened on land) & that I never used it for diving.I'm going to look for the old-style, single-button Casio watches that last roughly 5-6 years with extensive diving to 160', routinely to 70'.I may have gotten a defective watch, but not impressed that both analogue & digital died together. I'll be looking for a watch with a true back-up function or a very plain, simple watch again that's more reliable for a back-up for my bottom-timer."
3,Okay Watch,"This watch serves its purpose but it has several issues1) The digital portion tends to lock up.On several occasions, the digital part of the watch just froze. Sometimes it would clear up,but other times it would begin to beep without ceasing. I quickly figured out the only way to stop it was to hold all four buttons inat the same time until it completely reset. Then I had to re-enter everything and re-synchronize the digital and analogue. Total PITA.2) The Indiglo tends to randomly turn to night mode.This seems to happen whether you hold the appropriate button for that feature or not. This drains the battery.3) Short batter lifeI've run the heck out of my watch, I freely admit, but my first battery only lasted a year-and-a-half. I suspect Indiglo is much to blame, but it is probably the analogue side of things too.Bottom Line:I won't say don't buy this watch. It's one of the few hybrids out there and it does the job. Just have all the facts going in."
3,"Good, but not great","For a supposed ""Expedition"" watch, this has a few flaws that detract from what is otherwise a pretty good watch. First, the band is ridiculous. It's too thin and the velcro tab is constantly catching on things and pulling loose. Easily fixed with a $6 band from K-Mart. Second, the stem doesn't screw down and on two occasions, while doing some pretty hard physical labor, something has caught on it, pulled it out, and stopped the watch dead. Third, using the functions in the bottom window seems unnecessarily complicated. Maybe I just need to sit down with the instruction a few more times. I also wish the bezel was one-way, so when I'm timing something, I don't have to worry about bumping it and screwing up my timing.I bought this as a work watch and as such, it does fine, except for the stem. It's good looking, easy to read, and I especially like the lighted dial. Overall, as good a watch as I should expect for $40."
2,After 4 months the digital doesn't keep on ticking,"This watch had everything I could need in a watch, but after changing the time for daylight savings the digital won't work anymore. The light button won't even work. I have had this watch for barely 4 months and now for 5 days my watch stays on 3-7 SA. The alarm goes off every morning at 8am. I never set it to. I can't change anything but the analog time. Thankfully it still runs."
1,Caution ! ! ! !,"This is NOT a man's watch! The watch and the band are so small they would not even look masculine on a Homunculus! And unlike the picture, the band is not a cloth weave. It is that cheap nylon with Velcro ""fur"" all around it. Looks stupid and is uncomfortable as all get out!"
3,Difficult/nearly impossible to program Alarm and Digital Time,"I picked this watch out for a friend's birthday. Well after a few days he gave it back to me, he couldn't program it. Since my own watch battery had gone dead I decided I would keep it and use it rather than going to the hassle of returning it. It does keep time and has an Indiglo button and those are my basic requirements. However I did try to get the digital time working and turn off the alarms. Well I would get the time set and then notice the next day that it had gained an hour. I think this is either defective or there is something missing from the instructions. The velcro strap is a good idea. The watch is a big one. I wouldn't have picked this for myself. And it does not display day, date, etc. even though I entered them. I think the instructions are defective. Timex has to do better than this."
4,Nice watch,"This watch is very similar to one I purchased in 2002 and that one is still ticking after a lot of abuse. This new watch looks much better(other than the band).I was already aware that I would not like the velcro band so I changed it with a much better five dollar after market band. I am hoping to get around eight years of life from this Timex. I personally like a very light weight watch, so I prefer the resin (plastic) watches. This is is light weight, looks sporty and has both the analog and digital advantage.Update - 01/17/2013 I still am wearing this watch everyday and it still works great. Had to replace the battery for the first time, it was easy to do."
4,timex watch,The watch itself is very nice but the watchband is quite narrow and hard to put on. I put on a larger watchband that I had as an extra and now ok. The watch itself is quite nice. It has a good lighted background with either the date/day that shows on the bottom
3,"Works, keeps time, bad band, bezel","This watch looks like a 15-25 dollar watch, I put a new band on it and it looks ok. I do like the options it has and the indiglo, but the dial being plastic really puts this watch in the lower end category. It does keep time well."
5,Good Watch!!!,"This is a good watch for the money! 2nd one in ten years, used for work in the concrete field. it does take a licking for sure. the band it comes with is bad! I just replaced mine with a leather band."
2,Don't get it wet !!,"Timepiece delivers in terms of accuracy and wearability, very light..Easy to read... not that easy in the dark, the Indiglo hasn't a very good performance...Digital interface is not friendly at all, very hard to handle.I got to the pool, no buttons pressed and it got a lot of water inside, in a way that when wearing it you could see drops on the inside of the glass...If you can afford something better (or a Casio) go for it.."
2,"the only CD by C.B. worth listening to, barely","Captain Beefheart, the single most pretentious and overrated rock artiste, ever. Captain Kangaroo with an Amos 'n Andy fixation. His singing style was an over-the-top, belligerent rant. His famous sprung rythyms were just snatches of Warner Brothers cartoon sound effects played repetitively. His ""poetic"" lyrics were cool if you're easily impressed by children's verse. It's a fine line between childlike and childish, and C.B. falls on the childish side. There were a couple good songs on ""Clear Spot"" though. Hard to believe Beefheart composed them by himself."
5,Class,"Trout Mask Replica is a pretty stinking record, but beefheart and his magic band have made some really good albums, spotlight kid and clear spot being the two best, absolutely fantastic stuff. Clear spot takes the honours as the out and out best though, featuring possibly my favourite song of all time, Her eyes are a blue million miles. forget trout mask and get this. brilliant."
5,clear spot,"clear spot is truly awesome blues-rock. slightly experimental, but ultimatly accesable. this album truly shows how influential captain beefheart is. this album predates punk, new wave, and the talking heads. he's like a psychadelic david byrne. the lyrics are awesome. his vocals show a certain depth of beauty and soul at times. he also knows how to write a good pop tune. it's like the Safe as Milk of the '70's. check it out."
4,Little bits of darkness,"Harold Budd's body of work since the mid-70s has been concerned with a lush, beautiful area of sound. It's worth noting that Budd's work was one of the first things released by Brian Eno on his influential and aptly-named Obscure label. And while this album is a lush, dark, and beautifully atmospheric effort, I find that the occasional poetry...as also occurs on his collaboration with Andy Partridge of XTC...detracts from the atmosphere that the pieces themselves build up. It would've been more effective, I think, if the music had been left to just flow and the verbal bits had been left for perhaps another release where they could've been merged with the music in a more effective manner. But by no means does this mean you shouldn't buy this work; there's a lot here that's more than worthwhile."
3,could be better,"Like the look and feel of this watch. That said there are a few dealbreakers for me which is why I'm shopping for a new one:1: Second hand does not glow in the dark. Not a huge issue for most people but I need it in order to do my job. 'nuff said.2: Light only stays on as long as you hold it. If you hold it down and it changes to ""light-stays-on-for-4-seconds"" mode, that mode doesn't stick...an hour or so later and it's back to only lighting up while you press it. Why allow us to change the mode if I can't keep it?3: This is the big one - THE KNOB FOR SETTING THE ANALOG CLOCK POPS OUT TOO EASILY. I am an RN and this means two things - I NEED to always know what time it is, and I do ALOT of work with my hands. I can't tell you how many times I've looked down and the clock is an hour or more off. It seems to be rubbing on my hand when my wrist is bent and just popping out. This occurs without even noticing, that's how easily this knob pops."
2,Not As Described by Amazon,"This Timex watch (model T45221) as described by Amazon: ""It features a large silver stainless steel watch case that's topped by a special grip bezel with black engraved elapsed time markings and coin-edged detailing for a sure grip in inclement conditions."" In fact, the case is plated brass (per my experience after purchasing this watch, and according to Timex's site) and the bezel is merely decorative with a smooth edge and it cannot be rotated or gripped well while I'm sitting at my desk, let alone in the field. One more thing: Amazon says this watch's bracelet has a safety clasp, and the site includes a link to a drawing showing the clasp. This, too, is inaccurate, for the bracelet has no safety clasp. It's a nice-looking watch, but I know from previous experience with brass-cased Timexs that it will corrode on my wrist in about a year. That's why I had hoped this one would be an upgrade, but it isn't. I'll be returning it."
5,Great buy,"I wanted a low-cost, sturdy, everyday watch that was a little more stylish than the nylon-banded Expedition but that retained all of its features. This is that watch. The metal band bother me a little when I do extended keyboard typing, so I take it off. But other than that it is very comfortable and I have no complaints."
3,Directions are horrible,I got the watch as a Christmas gift for my dad. While programing the watch the alarm went off. It took about five minutes to get it to stop (my brother said he ended up hitting every button before it stopped). The watch was too big and needed a couple links taken out. The directions were not very helpful at all. I told my dad I'd give him the receipt so he could send it back. He said the watch worked fine (as long as you don't set the alarm off).
3,Not your typical Timex,"I love Timex watches. They are somewhat durable, long lasting, inexpensive, and for the most part they all function the same. This watch is attractive. In fact my 14 year old son has pretty much permanently borrowed it. However, it does not have the same functions as other Timex watches. It's much more difficult to set the alarms, and time. First you must press different buttons, and hold them down, which isn't easy because they are small and metal and you have press down hard. And the sequence is different than other Timex watches. In summary, attractive, but functions differently (and not as well) as other Timex watches."
4,Hubby's favorite,"This is the third Times Expedition watch he's had in the last 12 or so years and he loves it. The plating eventually wears off and corrodes, but they still work, so he wears them when he is doing yard or other grunt work. And this last one disappoints only because it doesn't have a moveable bezel like the other ones. He gave his Rolex to our son because he prefers his Timex and only wore the Rolex on special occasions."
2,Poor instructions - challenging to use,"I wanted a watch with large hands to easily see the time, that is OK. Would like the stopwatch and alarm but do not use them as it is very difficult to figure out how to use them. The alarm is actually set and goes off daily at 2:42, I gave up trying to figure out how to turn it off. The instructions that came with it clearly do not match this watch. the night light works fine."
1,"Of all the compilations, this is the worst I've heard.","If you can imagine a Lawrence Welk impersonator playing at a nursing home bake sale, and you can imagine yourself enjoying this, then here is the CD for you. The artists' names are often not listed, and the authors of the songs hard to identify -- perhaps with good reason. Basically, 'All the Best' seems like a collection of songs that lost the competition for the 'hold' music on the telephones at the Havana Bureau of Unemployment. Put your six bucks towards Cachao or Cubanismo or any of the dozens of other Cuban CD's available at Amazon which will never disappoint you in the way that this one does. 'All the Best' is like a box of shoddy imitation cigars bought from a jinetero at the Malecon."
3,scent is mild,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift. I am concerned that the package says"" refillable natural spray"". The scent should be great as I have used it before. I will update after the holidays. Love the scent, however does not last long."

3,Great American marches,"Sousa marches always get my blood moving and this CD has most of the best; the CD I received did not have all 18 marches as promised, rather it duplicated Semper Fidelis several times. Still great music to keep you awake driving and to get the kids out of bed. Three stars for lack of the full 18 marches. Good deal for the price."
1,Item not as pictured or described,"Beware when ordering extra boosters - you may not receive what you expect. Judging from the photo (& lack of further description), I incorrectly assumed that I would be getting a pack of 60 white **and** red boosters. As in, 30 of each.Instead, I received 60 white boosters.Boo."
1,Great toy but this was a mislabeled accessory,This is actually just a refill pack for the Mighty Missile launcher. The launcher is awesome! But this refill pack came with only white (the weaker boosters). So my kids were disappointed because the product image clearly shows both colors and they wanted red because they are the strongest boosters. Again... this is an awesome toy. They just need to be more clear about what they are selling.
1,GROSS!,"So called ""Delancey"" looks STUPID! I warn you, never ever get any ""Delancey"" junk. The alwas look weird!!!!!"
4,this is a good product,I was satisfied with this ramp kit. It is of good quality and works well. I would recomend this kit for a cheeper alternative .
4,Lund Ramp Kit,"Amazon,Once again you have delivered what your offering. Very please with my purchase."
4,"LUND 8"" RAMP KIT","These are (2) Heavy duty aluminum 8"" ramp ends. Designed to work with a 10"" or 12"" wide x 2"" thick wood plank. Very easy to install; drill (2) 5/16"" holes and bolt the ramp ends to your self supplied wood plank. Foam rubber provided for protection of truck gate on the underside of the ramp end. (2) smaller pins provided for the ramp tonque to hold the plank in place on the tail gate. However, instructions were very vague in how they are used; hence the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. Good American made product!"
4,Weight limit 700lbs,Be advised- The load limit on these ramp ends is 700lbs and an ATV weighs 700lbs but the directions say to not ride anything on the ramps. Apparently they are not strong enough for ATVs. I think I'll beef up the wood ramps and go for it.
5,Everyone should have a copy,"I am a senior citizen(female) and I just finished reading""Inside of me"". I think that everyone should read this book this young lady has done a spectacular job in writing this book. I wish that particularly young women could read this and be wise enough to take heed and they will avoid some of the hurt and pain that Shellie went through. This should also be a wakeup call for parents to listen to their children and to put them first especially during their formative years.Thank you sweet Shellie for allowing God to use you to help heal others and yourself."
5,AWESOME,I am only 15 and I read this book and it was a very well written book. Shellie has an awesome awesome testimony. If you can read this book. Hopefully it will touch you like it touched me.
5,Shellie Warren Is The Next Big Thing,"If ever there was a testament to the power of faith and healing, it is Shellie Warren. Shellie's ability to weave multiple viewpoints allows men to examine the role that they play in relationships. Reading ""Inside Of Me"" will help some men understand the impact that their words and behaviors have on a woman during the course of their time together.Shellie is telling the stories of women whose voices are missing, not because they don't want to speak, but because they don't get heard. ""Shellie Warren is to writing, what Mary J. Blige is to song."""
4,Signature Dash Cover,"This dash cover is very nice. Fits nicely, and is as advertised. I am very happy with it."
1,Defective unusable junk - avoid completely,"These ""ancors"" break off in the wall when you attempt to screw them in. Their design/engineering is wretchedly bad.The problem with them is they are made ""pre-broken"". The designers, in a misguided attempt at increasing their pull-out strength, incorporated a longitudinal crack running through the length of the ""ancor"". When you torque them into drywall, the torsion causes the crack to open and then rupture the plastic before they are even halfway in.Note that other companies make virtually identical anchors without the longitudinal crack. These work perfectly and are what I recommend using. I guess if you can't spell ""anchor"" properly, then engineering a plastic anchor is far too challenging."
4,Does exactly what you need.,"These little puppies are really nice to work with. I have 2 that I use with a controller to film my youtube videos as well as Using them for a junior high service at my chuch in conjuction with 8 par64s, 2 mega bars and a few small moving heads. they make a really nice accent. In a small room/ stage they give a nice level of colored light. On a larger stage, they are great for just giving that small colored dot when well placed. (you may need 12 or more to make a decent amount of light if your stage is large) they project a wide spot but it is still an obvious circle visible on the surface if it's withing 20 feet. They are a neat addition no matter what your size is."
5,Worth it,I just got it day ago. It works great and is a good addition to a set of ights. Four of these would do the job for a decent gig. On time delivery too.
5,great mouse alternative,I purchased this easycat to replace an easycat I have been using for the last 10 years. The left button on the older device was finally showing a little wear. I have aKinesis Advantage USB - Keyboard - USB - blackwhich fits this mouse easily in the empty space between the sets of keys.
5,I'm definitely enjoying this product,"I've tried some different mice recently because a normal mouse strains my wrist and hand. This one is the best I've found so far. I don't have to squeeze anything with my fingers, so it's much more comfortable. All I have to do is glide my finger over the touchpad, and tap the touchpad when I need to click on something. Occasionally I need the left or right button, but that's not a strain at all. And I don't have to open it up and clean it out, which is a definite plus. My favorite mouse. Expensive but worth it."
2,Save your money.,"I love Falco, but this CD just does not do his great music any good whatsoever. It's a bunch of half-rate remixes of top notch songs."
1,A real hash up of a good album,"This album only bears superficial resemblance to the FALCO 3 album, on which its based. Some songs sound good remixed, but others should have been left well enough alone... If you're a Falco fan, stick with one of the other albums, this one does not induce listening ""pleasure""."
1,If you want Falco-do NOT buy this album,This takes Falco beats and some lyrics but makes it the Artist's(thats remixing the song)property... It begins to get bad after awhile... One of the Club Mixes boosted the would-of-been 1 up to a 2.
1,NUKE THIS ONE OUT OF COMMISSION NOW!,"Do you really want to put your ear drums to the test? Then play this one, and you will see them climb out of your ears so fast and run away. This CD shows no respect for the late Falco. The worst remixes I have heard in a long time. Rock Me Amadeus is a mess, as is Jeanny and Vienna Calling - which they put the short version on NOT the long version, also the remix is mediocre at best, other ruined songs are Jungle Romer and a medley of his hits. Sorry Falco, your childrens trust fund won't be growing with this CD."
1,SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD I BROUGHT IT BACK FOR A REFUND.,"When I saw Falcos remix CD I was so excited, until I played it. The remixes are so bad, especially Rock Me Amadeus...you wonder if you are even listening to the song. The other remixes are just as bad with maybe the exception of Jungle Romer, which tires fast. A definite miss."
1,DON'T SHOW THE MONEY !!!,"If you are buying this for his one hit ""Amadeus"", don't. This song is remixed and is not even close to as good as the original, as far as the rest of the album, it sucks bad. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this album, buy the single!"
4,Mostly good remix collection,"I'm a big Falco fan from the early 80s, from the minute I saw videos for Der Komissar and Zuviel Hitze on MTV. This remix CD will disappoint if you are looking for the ""Salieri"" version of Rock Me Amadeus or the extended American remix of Vienna Calling. They are all new 1990s ""club versions"" and, while not as good, are mostly still enjoyable in their own right... Well, tracks 1-7 are all good but the rest are awful, IMO. Get this album if you are a die-hard Falco fan and not just a fan of his American hits because most of the songs are in German language only."
1,"I LOVE FALCO, BUT THIS IS A DISAPPOINTMENT.","Falco had some good songs, but his label that came out with this remix collection- what were they thinking!...First ""Rock Me Amadeus"" - there are so many remix versions, and they put the lamest one on, it is so remixed you wonder if you are even listening to the song., ""Vienna Calling"", great remix song too, but not on this CD, they use the weaker, shorter version, and ""Jeanny"", oh my GOD! they ruined this song. They only bright spot actually is the song I liked the least from Falco ""Der Kommisar"" which shows brilliance, otherwise this CD is a bust. The label should of paid great homage to the Late Falco, instead they wanted to make a fast buck. Shame on you Warner Bros. records, shame on you!"
5,Dramatic Stories,"At six and quarter by nine and quarter by one and three eights inches thick hardcover, it looks to be crammed with gripping tales of people cured ! One young girl, who faced amputation from gangrene eat the flowers brought to her and the grass and leaves she could reach when nobody was looking. Original doctors where stunned to see their terminal patient so well off. At over 410 pages, lots of room for more stories ! Garlic, parsley tea, and watercress seem to be a diuretic ! Cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and bay leaf something to do with blood sugar ! On and on it goes ! Interesting and so far dramatic !! Thank You !!!!"
3,Good Book,"Book is very interesting, Not sure everything came from the Bible. Good reading and I am sure sum of it will work."
2,awesome material,unfortunately the book was missing several chapters so was kind of a let down . my money was refunded but would of much rather had the book and information it provided
4,mirical food cures from the bible,my wife has been reading the book and is finding several interesting menu's that help one's health. very informative
3,reviews,"Most OK. Will order more items when needed. Sales tax does kind of hurt though.Anyway, I will compare your prices to others."
5,A great remedy guide.,"This book has a Contents section in the front and an Index in the back making it very useful as a guide to food cures found in the Bible.There are cautionary words and testimonials throughout the book.I find the book is also educational in a Biblical sense.There is information on plants,herbs,oils etc..that are mentioned in Scripture.This book has proven beneficial to me personally with the discovery of Essiac Tea and information on Saw Palmetto.If you are looking for a guide book of natural remedies this would be a great choice!It's comprehensive and easily navigated."
4,Bible Food Cures,"This is a very good book that discusses many food and herbal cures from the Old and New Testaments. It includes real-life stories, scientific studies from many sources.""Rosemary is one of the bushes that gave shelter to the Virgin Mary in the flight into Egypt...In 1235,Queen Elizabeth of Hungary fell in love ..at 72, crippled with rhuematism and gout. Rosmary soaked in wine for 4 days and applied to her legs...cured her."" page 15You will see many amazing stories like the one above in this book. A Very Good Book!!"
5,Quality and Accuracy,"I bought a hard back copy of this book a long time ago. I made tea out of a few of the suggested herbs, and they worked. I bought a softback copy for my mother-in-law. She made tea out of a few of the suggested herbs, and they worked. I believe that this book is a very good book for those who seriously want to make natural home remedies.Thank You"
3,Interesting,This is an interesting book for anyone who wants to know about alternative cures from the bible without having to read and re-read the bible.
3,Mirical Food Cures,I did not find this book as useful for my study of foods from the Bible times. It had some interesting suggestions for cures but I was disappointed. I may find it useful for any more subjects that come up as you never know when something offered in this book will help me.I am always on the look out for healthy foods that keep one's energy level high.
2,Nothing great.....,This sheet arrived in a nice bright green color. I just washed it once and the color has faded already. I just did a gentle wash cycle and line dried it. The measurements are good for a std crib mattress and the material soft.
1,It Has To Be Seen And Heard To Be Disbelieved,"The dialogue, the set design, the ""performances,"" the plot development - What blender did it all come out of? Who sat in the screening room and thought, ""Hey! The kids will love it!"" It's almost as obscure and illogical as most of the performance art that I've seen. They must have had a suicide hotline installed on the set. This was shown on TCM as part of their ""Underground"" series, along with ""Roller Boogie"" on the same night. See it if you dare, or if you're a well-mannered drag queen who wants a laugh at someone else's expense."
1,Bad but not fun,"This movie fails in every department. A musical with bad songs (it was the first effort from the composer who later went on to score Mortal Kombat II and American Ninja III). Frequent dance scenes with dull choreography. A message movie with nothing to say. An earnest movie warning the audience about evil record producers, created by Golan/Globus, men who made a career of producing movies that cheated audiences.It WAS fun to see such a flagrant gay sensibility in a 1980 movie. One dance number cut between firemen, construction workers, policemen in tights, and a biker gang in black leather. But the flip side of that is that the women's costumes weren't sexy: they were just weird.The comparison between The Apple and Rocky Horror Picture Show is unfair. Rocky Horror had great songs, fine singers, a sense of humor, and a clever visual style. The Apple has none of that."
2,Not golden or delicious,"I brought this film because it's projected as a silent backdrop at a club I go to and it looks completely surreal. However, after getting it home I realised why I had never heard of it before. It is absolutely dire. Terrible plot, acting and songs. Not even campily funny in manner of Showgirls or Rocky Horror. Just awful."
4,"Weird, but kind of fun","There is no real way to describe this film except to say that it is goofy and enjoyable. While not a classic (I doubt I could watch it many times) it is worth seeing once or twice. The ""future"" of 1994 is just funny. It's worth it to see all the weird clothes and makeup. The acting is, at times, a little over the top, but that's intentional.The musical numbers are varied and many. While clearly a lot of effort was put into them, they are not particularly memorable. The same could be said for the songs, which left barely an impression at all once the movie was over. But while they're going on, you can enjoy them.Worth a watch if you're interested in some eighties strangeness, but otherwise, I'll stick with Xanadu."
1,The worst piece of work I ever loved.,"I thought I would continue going through life singing ""Alfie where are you now, Will I ever see your face again?"" Thank you for the release of this lack luster film. I think everyone should take the pill, it won't harm you, it won't make you laugh, cry, or scream in anger either. It is blah blah to the extreme. If you loved the Biz Marke song. You got what I need! You need this."
2,One great track,"I bought this CD honestly simply when searching for one elusive track that I had had a bad copy of - the Track 7 ""Theme suite"" which involves both the TOS and Movie themes. This piece is done by a real orchestra, and is worth the cost by itself if you can find the CD really cheap. The rest of the tracks, however, aren't done by orchestra at all but rather, it sounds, mostly as electronic keyboard arrangements. Just go buy the original film scores; much better by far. Track 7 though, again, is worth finding any way you can."
2,Synth-city,"Not that great, really. One track is pretty decent, #7, which is a suite of various themes from the original series TV show and movies. But it's performed by an actual orchestra. The rest of the CD is all-synth manufactured music. On some of the tracks, like the Klingon Battle and Theme from Star Trek The Motion Picture, the synthy sound isn't that bad, it's actually almost good (and a little different). On others, like the Theme for The Voyage Home, it's just awful, you can barely hear the main theme music over the accompanying synthed instruments. Kind of a mixed bag, but all right if you get it cheap."
4,Memorable and Validating,"Dr. Walker is a good and articulate writer who accomplishes an amazing amount -- from South Africa to Boston -- in just 139 pages of very short chapters on a mercifully brief but pivotal marriage to a borderline personality (and her privileged psychogenic family) while in medical school and on his close Catholic family life as one of eight children. A necessarily cathartic memoir, Dr. Walker is a compassionate but awake psychiatrist whose ""instinct for self-preservation"" motivated a savvy specialization in BPD. Highly recommended for non-bps in need of validation, not recommended for borderline personalities who are not well into recovery."
3,A different view,"This book is hard to review because it is a combo. On one had it is a facinateing and entertaining story and worth a read for anyone. On the other had it is help up like a ""medical guide"" or a factual, researched thesis. Perhaps because of the name ""case study"" and the fact that the author is a Doctor.While reading this book one should bear in mind that it is a memoir of someone's life - not a medical journal. If this is kept in mind the book is an insightful read. If, however, this book is taken as ""gospel truth"" it could be dangerouse to anyone dealing with a relationship that nvoles mental illness (either as the ill person or the non-ill person) It is one person's story... not a script that all relationships or all people with BPD follow.My thanks to the heartfelt review of the ""mood shifter"" You may want to also read ""An Unquiet Mind"" as it is also a memoir and does not present itself like a self-help book."
2,Invitation to relationship problems,"It seems that Dr. Walker forgot the first commandment for therapists: do not socialize with patients. In the case of former patients, two years must elapse before there is any contact outside of the therapeutic relationship. Dr. Walker failed to maintain clear boundaries and invited disaster. He portrays himself as a victim who was simply trying to ""rescue"" a patient who was diagnosed with BPD. He conveniently views his book as a case study of a borderline. He describes what it is like to live with someone suffering from an irrational fear of abandonment, but he doesn't acknowledge his contribution to the failed relationship. How about the havoc and problems his ""unprofessional"" behavior caused for his mentally ill wife. Shame on you, Dr.Walker!"
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This is by far the shallowest account of a relationship with a borderline I have read. I wish borderlines in general were as explicit in their intentions and their extreme neediness as the main character honestly stated from the beginning in this story (except for the violent side). Also, in this case, the 'victim' was never mistaken for the 'bad guy', as it happens frequently, and the writer was able to get support even from the borderline's family."
1,Too many errors and full of fluff,"When a novel has errors it loses its credibility and I stop dead in my reading track.On page 94 and 95 of the hardback copy, the couple goes to a laundry and proceed to fight. Suddently the laundry contains article from their apartment,which they demolish as they fight.Mistakes continue on pages 127 where the author/doctor's younger sister,credited with the first college diploma in his family, died at the age of 22. Did he not receive a diploma?Age-related errors continue on page 137.AS far as its BPD content, the novel is fluffy."
2,"Good Content, Terrible Grammar Mistakes","As a student in a Masters' program for social work, I find the subject content to be thoroughly entertaining.I do, however, find it difficult to understand why Dr. Walker would misspell words and be so errant in not hiring an editor when putting out a book that readers are to believe is a ""case study"" in which he is supposedly able to remain impartial.Book lacks credibility, but is entertaining. 2 stars at best."
1,Absolute crap,"reading this makes me wonder if this author has ever known a borderline or if he/she got the info from a book. Its this type of rhetoric that puts such a horrible stigma on borderline. Im appalled. if , mr walker, you are infact a doctor, you should be ashamed of yourself."
3,Anthony Walker Please Proof Read Your Work.,"I do not want to get into my feelings about this book. I did read it because I was in a relationship with a BPD. It gave me some incite.I would just like to say to Dr. Anthony that if his attention to detail (I actually mean ...lack thereof) in his medical profession is anything like he attention to detail in this book there must be many unhappy patients. I have NEVER read a book with so many typos, wrong words, repeated and misplaced sentences, in my life. Dr. Anthony, please hire a proofreader or buy a new text editor. I know you cannot reprint the book, but please have someone correct the ebook as it is really unprofessional and embarrassing to release a short memoir with about 50 text errors in it. Please take a little pride."
4,Siren's Dance hits close to home,"Siren's Dance was not written by an experienced writer, but in it Anthony Walker painted a clear and accurate picture of the problems faced by families and friends, when dealing with a person suffering from a borderline personality disorder. The author described and illustrated the behaviour of the sufferer, and in a compassionate way showed the despair behind the behaviour. He also showed the debilitaing effect the behaviour of a sufferer of borderline personality disorder has on those close to her. I recommend it to anyone who is troubled by manipulative and disruptive behaviour of someone they know."
5,great tribute to Rpky,excellent versions of 13th Floor Elevator and Roky Erikson songs....makes you wish their were clean recordings of the 13th Floor Elevator songs out there.....great great cd...buy it
5,Motorcraft EGR Valve Review CX1721 for 2001 Triton 5.4L V8,It works.It does not come with a gasket.You will need to buy a new gasket.
5,Great Binos,"2 binos in one. Switch from 10 power to 17 power in a jiffy, then back. Quality optics,waterproof and fogproof, lifetime warranty,moderate weight, and overall just great. A bit pricey, but in the world of optics especially, it usually pays to spend more to get more. Limited edition so a little hard to find these now."
3,Not to shabby,It is very difficult to use at first because it is tacky and sticky. But if you use it with a combonation with another adhesive it makes the vapon more manageable. However I wouldn't advise using it if you live in hot hot areas. Your lace wig will slip and move :(
2,Good if used as a short term bonding agent,"This is a good bonding agent if you plan on wearing your unit for 1-2 days. If it is summer, or you live in a hot area, this is not a good adhesive. The wig will shift and slip. When the unit slips, the glue remains very tacky around the area, so your hair sticks to the areas (ruining the unit). I've had to reapply my hair 3 times this week. Also, this can be considered difficult to work with as the glue is not very viscous (a bit runny) and it drips and runs when too much is applied."
3,not so easy brezzy,"vapon no tape is not a bad product , but the instruction say to give it 25 minutes to dry, and it seem to be dry yet it did not fully stick i was not sure when to apply my lace wig , i had to do alot of touch up and the product is a little thick and messy so you have to be careful applying it. oh, i did notice when i first started to apply the vapon no tape i put it on too thickly and it looked white in color , so again , be careful."
4,"well done, but suspend belief","Very good running book, especially if you need some motivation to get out there and run. My only complaint is it was fairly unbelievable. But nonetheless, an enjoyable read and will spur you on to put in the tough miles to qualify for Boston (it never does say how he qualified)."
2,This book is a mess,"Granted, there is a lot of good information in this text, however, it's presented in a format that is neither intuative or flowing. Even the examples are overly complicated, almost like the author(s) are attempting to obscure the very point that needs to be made w/ extraneous code. It's a same that the documentation on this subject so poor."
2,This book is really out of order,"I bought this book with the expectation that it would give me a better understanding of the language, but it started out too deep with the functions and the cartridges and then explained the basics that it had used in those examples only at the end of the book. The examples were too long to understand the specific topic and many times they did not have the output so that the reader could see what the functions produced. With a little re-arrangement and some more output from examples, it could be a valuable reference."
3,Kareoke Zone,"This is a beautifully compiled, engineered and produced disc which delivers all that it promises. Nevertheless, it feels like a long evening at the kareoke bar on Burt Bacharach night, and gets tedious without Dionne Warwick, BJ Thomas, Austin Powers et. al. to liven things up. Thanks for the memories, Burt!!"
1,Dont buy it......,"Worked Ok for about 13 months. The pic wasnt great before that either. So now a month after the warranty it flips out. The black ""Polaroid"" startup screen is now all red. The pictures is totally screwed, its kind of hard to explain what has happened to it, the resolution is screwed, pixelized garbage and the colors are way off. Called Polaroid and after talking to a guy there he said he has come to the end of his troubleshooting abilities and said I could send it back to Polaroid and they would SELL me another. Kinda funny, I entertained the notion to see how much they wanted to charge, they said they would call back with a price. A week later a guy calls at 2:00 PM wanting numbers on the back of the plasma. I am at work so cant do it. He said he would call back at 5:00 PM when I am off work, no call. Been a week and nothing. Long story short........Dont buy it."
1,Gimme A Break,Even the most diehard fan has to be rolling his eyes and clutching his wallet.What is the record company trying to prove?How much they can bilk the public?Don't walk past this cd...run!!!!!!!!
1,BAD BEST OF,What's going on here? Best of?......YEAH RIGHT! there isn't half of there good songs on here! what is going on with the 12 track thing anyway. it's not like there's a limit of 30 minutes or something!! 20th Century Best Of's always suck. FOR ALL YOU BEST OF MAKERS......PUT AS MANY SONGS AS THE F***ING CD WILL HOLD!!!
1,awfull,"This compilation is the worst one of kiss.They already had enough!I dont care the price i dont recommend it to anyone even casuals.There are many better kiss compilation like double platinum,the rare killers,greatest kiss,you wanted the best you got the best and many others.The compilation includes 12 songs from the original lineup from74-79 but avoid this compilation buy about every other compilation its the cheapest compilation and there is a reason to that.not worth the money at all!stay away from it!"
4,New Recruit,"I guess you'd have to call me a new recruit to the KISS Army. I remember only a few songs of theirs from the past, and those only vaguely. But recently I started hearing some on my local rock station, so I bought this CD, and I must say that I like every track. If you like classic guitar rock, this is for you, because it is just loaded to the gills with a plethora of excellent guitar sounds. As for individual songs, ""Beth"" is a great early rock ballad, ""Calling Dr. Love"" is hard buzz-saw rock, and ""Christeen Sixteen"" is, thankfully, drenched in sex. My favorite, ""I Was Made For Loving You"", proves that rock can be mixed with a tasty disco flavor, just as Donna Summer's hit ""Hot Stuff"" showed that disco could be pumped up by rock. And of course, KISS's signature song, ""Rock And Roll All Nite"", is included on this disc. Now, this is not world-changing music, but it is head-bangin', so be sure to PLAY IT LOUD."
3,"Yeah, another kiss greatest, But very brief look, missing alot, but at least its not expensive","Yeah, die hard kiss fans own this one, but I picked it was cheep, and it has some of their big songs, but not nessecarily a hardcore fans favorites. Such a big catalog, and so few songs on one disc. They now have 3 volumes in this collection, which just begins to touch the kiss catalog of songs, but its ok. Their is a 2 disc gold collection out now that has more of the older stuff on it, check that one out if you feel this one is missing some, but I find this one sufficent for my need."
1,??????????????????????????????,Another boring compilation. Nothing new. Not even a new remix. Same old same old.
1,One of your biggest fans Kiss !,"I might be one of your biggest fans but can you tell me why you released this album?All the same songs re released over and over again.The problem is that the die hard Kiss fans will buy this album just to own it. I bet they will never actually play it though.Come on Kiss, let's get some new material together which will be worth buying.Sad thing is I am going to buy this just to keep my collection up to date and that's why they have released it anyway!"
4,"The ""Mini-Me"" version of ""The Very Best Of""","Made in USA in 2003, Serial# B000082702, Playing Time 41:26In short (get the joke?), what we have here are 12 tracks ALSO available on the ""The Very Best Of"" compilation, so we're short-changed by 9 tracks and 34 minutes of music (they even used the same ""Detroit Rock City"" remixed version that appeared on ""Double Platinum"", not the one from ""Destroyer"" as credited in the liner notes!)""20th Century Masters"" also compiles the material in chronological order, but stops at 1979's ""Dynasty"" album.Sub-titled ""The Millennium Collection"", it should in fact be called ""The 70's Collection"".A cheap (or should I say ""budget"" ?) version of ""The Very Best Of""; I suggest you skip this altogether, and get the full compilation that covers 3 decades, all the way to the ""Revenge"" album."
2,Two stars becuase every song is worth 5 stars BUT......,"OK, didn't ""The Very Best Of Kiss"" come out barely a year before this? With a stronger song selection? And didn't ""Alive IV"" just come out a few weeks before? With most of these songs preformed live? The cow is just about dry, fellas. Get back in the studio and prove you still have something left to say.5 stars for the songs, 1 star for the audacity."
3,"How many ""BEST OF"" cd's can one band have?","Although I love KISS, how many ""BEST OF"" albums can you have--especially when they all have the same songs! Come on guys, stop releasing the same old stuff."
1,KISS Recycles Again - Cash In Continues,"Here we have yet ANOTHER greatest hits collection from KISS. What, they didnt think they covered it well enough with Double Platinum, Smashes, Thrashes and Hits, Greatest Kiss, 4 Live albums, the Symphony album which also contains no new material, the BOX SET they released last year, etc. etc. etc. ENOUGH already! It's time for them to stop pretending they are viable and making new music and just go away already! I am a KISS fan since 1975, and they are coming to Detroit, where I live, and I have absolutely no interest in seeing them anymore. It is the same thing over and over and over and over and I am sick of being asked to cough up 100-150 dollars and get nothing different."
2,What the Hell!,"This is so pathetic! This is no good even for a casual kiss fan. it does not have cold gin, firehouse, parasite, shout it out loud, god of thunder, I stole you and other classics. This sucks!"

3,Watch this and bring your imagination,"because sloppy editing, lack of solid example shots and wasted footage watching Jensen hit a ball (but not actually seeing for yourself where it ends up - what good is that) leave you wanting more. Even for beginning players I would not recommend this, simply because of the price. I bought this based on the glowing reviews that seem to have been written by Jensen's buddies. OK, I'll admit it was mildly interesting to watch at first. Jensen's tips reminded me that I was doing certain things wrong, but ultimately I found myself getting a video camera out taping myself playing. The purpose of the DVD is obviously to go over a lot of different aspects of tennis at once. There is so much repetitive footage of Jensen hitting a ball to an unknown opponent, without us actually seeing how well he hit the ball. They could have done a much better job for the price."
5,"This book relates the Man of Love, Truth, and Happiness.","I have read countless books in my life and I've been blessed to come into the company of some very remarkable men. Nevertheless there is no book, and no man, that has impressed me as much as this book has. This book is filled with hope, truth, and love."
4,TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT,"People who waste their time hating Adi Da Samraj should really get a life. Adi Da Samraj isn't DOING anything to anyone. Read his books if you want, and don't, if you don't want. Hating Adi Da Samraj is about as useful as hating Jesus or Buddha or whoever you chose to blame your pathetic life problems on. Why not read ""Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting"" and get on with your existence. Your life sucks because YOU created it through your own actions or inactions - Adi Da Samraj had nothing to do with it. That said, I recommend this book for those interested in opening their minds beyond their limited concepts of the world."
3,"Life, and Works of Adi Da. Not for serious students!","The ""Promised God-Man Is Here"" represents the begining of what will soon be a flood of works by current students, ex-studenst, and by the general researching public about the Master Adi Da Samaraj. This particular piece is disapointing in that it is a bland, and heavily edited version of the life and teaching of this remarkable figure. Known for his ""Crazy Wisdom"", and wild nature, he is considered in some religio / Spiritual study centers as the prima-religious thinker of the later twentieth century. The ""Promised God-Man Is Here"" is a good begining students primer on the general, and over-all life and teaching of Adi Da Samaraj, but NOT for the serious student of Adi Da himself, or his works. Ms. Lee Carolyn's work is a glowing and personaly expressive work that appears to have attempted the work of that great chronicler of Ramakrishna, ""M"", but has failed."
5,Greatest Story Ever Told,"Who could believe it? (as if belief were the point)Test it in reality and in your feeling and you will discover it verifies itself in your very consciousness!To quote one of the jacket quotes: ""If you were allowed to read only one book in your lifetime, this should be the one.""It is beyond belief.

1,Where's the hard edge for filling?,"Just be warned these do not have the hard lip that the expandable 8-10 oz liners have so it's a careful process of holding these loose baggies in the bottle with your hands while filling them up. The hard edge liners stay in place while you fill them and never slip through the cylinder. I'm not a fan of these old fashion liners. I wish they made the hard edged liners in 8 oz sized, but they don't."
3,A bit flimsy,I never wound up using the whole roll. I gave them away after using a few. I just find the pre-shelled liners to be easier to work with (although less portable in a diaper bag).
1,horrible liners,"I bought 2 boxes of 4oz liners and 2 boxes of 8oz liners and i absolutely hate them. I have both the premium nurser bottles and the standard bottles, and when I use these liners they don't hold true to the ounce markings. I even use a real bottle that has true markings for ounces, and will put the water in there before filling the nurser bottle with this liner. Its almost as i the bottle isn't wide enough. And if I use the 4oz bottle with this liner and try to put in two scoops of formula and you can BARELY fit one scoop in! I received some preformed when I bought both sets of bottles and didn't try them at first since I had the other liners, but now that I've had so many difficulties with these liners- I'm using the preformed and I love them. So I guess I'll be giving away these liners!"
2,Pain in the butt,I usually get the preformed liners but decided to try these. I hate them. My husband hates them. And truthfully my daughter didnt like them. Plus regardless of what it says it doesnt hold 8 oz. I will never buy these again.
5,Better than pre-formed,"I like this liners a lot more than the pre-formed ones. Apart from being half the price it is a hundred times easier to measure the milk in these. They are marked clearly and I have found they are true to the measure, unlike the pre-formed where you have to measure in another container then pour in the breast milk or formula or whatever you're using it for. And it's not even hard at all to set this liners in place on the nursers. It takes me under 5 seconds to place them and they have never leaked a drop. Plus, I don't know if you mind this or not, but these liners are more eco friendly than the pre-formed.One other thing I really love about these is the fact that they come rolled up all together in a box and you can pull them out one by one like a dispenser, which I think helps them keep sterile a lot better than the other ones."
4,Better than the hard ones,"I only found at stores the ""hard"" ones that already ome shaped. I like this ones better cause the are more portable and don't get wrinkled in the bags. They also colapse better while the baby is drinking. We use this type of bottles specially for travelling so we don't have to worry about carrying several bottles. We just take the bottle, several nipples and bags."
1,Waste of money,"so far i tried the 4 and 10 oz liners and i was happy with them, but I decided to give this 8 oz liner a chance, it was a huge mistake. first than all, there is no way to keep the milk inside this package, it spills all the time, we have to keep it complete vertical but how I am suppose to feed my baby with a vertical liner??"
5,Got to do again,This is one of the best prices in the world for drop liners and on top of that it ships fast and packaged well.
1,Don't fit bottle!,"I bought these because they were cheaper and I thought I was getting the other drop-in liners. Obviously I didn't read the description well. I tried them anyways but I couldn't get them to fit the bottle well. They will work, but after 5 mins of fooling with them trying to stretch them over the bottle. Returning for refund."
1,Not good at all,These are certainly not good when compared to the ones with the rim around. I have been using Playtex liners with rim from day1 and I have always used the storage rings directly to put the nipple on. It helped me push the air easily Vs pushing air from inside the case. Now these type of thin liners without rim and bottom cannot be used.
5,I love these liners.,"I have used these liners for two children. I am about to use them for a third. If put on correctly they do not leak. The drop-in version of the liners tend to leak when you squeeze the air out of them. And, it is harder to measure with the drop-in kind. This kind that you slide down onto the rim of the bottle haven't leaked or caused me any troubles. I measure the powder and put in the bottle then when you have a hungry baby you simply fill with warm water and shake. This is very handy when you are away from home. I have a small metal IKEA thermos that I put my hot/warm water in before I leave home. My oldest child will soon be thirteen. I am excited about using these again for baby three due in November 2012!Everyone has their own opinion on things. I just happen to be one of the Mom's that really like these liners.FYI**If you are wanting the drop and go type of liners... these aren't them. These are the type you slide down over the rim of the bottle.**"
2,Dropins are better,"I used these exclusively with my first baby (10 years ago). I think that was the only kind they made back then! I thought they were fine then. For baby #2, I bought a roll of these. Then I saw the Drop In liners at the store. They are so much easier to use, they never leak, and are easier to measure in. The drop-ins are not as portable (like in a diaper bag) but the convenience and ease of use they have wins me over. I would buy the drop-ins instead of these."
1,Leaked Everywhere - Do Not Buy!,"These are very flimsy liners that are hard to install on the bottles. I filled the first two about halfway each and they leaked as soon as I took them out of the fridge. I lost about eight ounces of milk, which is quite a bit when you're pumping. I will never buy these again!"
3,Piece of junk!!,"My little sister got this for a present, and it broke in a week. The little, thin slots that hold the pieces of the slides together broke off, so water leaks through it. The slide falls off every 2 seconds, too. Also the Pollys can't go down the slide if they have their suits on, because they get stuck. The only good thing about this is the seal-he slides down REALLY fast and is the only thing that didn't break!"
4,SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!,"I use this every time I want to play with water pollys. I have the whole set of Wild Waves, so I make them into a Water Park. I have the Pool Party Set, also, so I add that to my water park. I would recommend this and the others to the Wild Waves Set to all Polly Fans that come in all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,What a heartbreaker!,"My 5 1/2 year old did a flu shot study and they gave her a gift card in compensation. We went straight to the store to buy this toy, that she's been watching ads for on tv. When we got home, I wanted to scream trying to put the thing together. The piece at the top falls out everytime I snapped the bottom slide on. Everytime she slid a doll down (manually, cuz the water sure didn't do it), the slide would break off again.My daughter is crushed. She wants to know why toys don't work at home the same way they work on tv. She wants to know if the ""Polly Pocket people"" know that the plastic floaties don't even float. I told her that at least she got another Polly and some great new accessories. We'll be writing a letter to the company. My little girl just learned a valuable lesson about a waste of HER OWN money."
2,Poorly designed toy! Use lots of tape!,"This has got to be the worst designed toy I've ever bought. We could not get this toy to stay together, no matter how hard we tried. So finally I got out some packing tape and taped all the slides together with lots & lots of tape. I expected the tape to come off once it got wet, but so far it has been holding the toy together fairly well. My girls do have lots of fun with the toy now that we have figured out how to hold it together! lol"
2,Good luck keeping it together,"First of all, it took a 20 minute phone call to the company to figure out how to assemble the toy WITHOUT it falling apart. They could not help me. You'd think it wouldn't be that difficult for two college educated parents to assemble a toy. The toy is a cute idea with poor craftmanship. It could NOT have been tested for actual use or it never would have hit the toy stores. You cannot keep the slides both on at the same time nor can you really keep the entire slide together. This toy went straight back to the store. The manufacturer has to know when something is inadequate. My girls love polly toys, but this was NOT a good investment."
3,Fun for a short time,"This is a cool little playset, but of course there are a million pieces to get lost after the first day. This is the nature of these miniature type of dolls, so if you're prepared to keep track of them then this is a decent set. Even if you lose some stuff, it's still usable and the price doesn't make it a tragedy if the toy only makes it through a season.The only issue with the play we found is that the swing pops off all the time."
2,Junk!,"I concur with previous reviewers that this is junk! My daughters love polly pockets. I figured it would be fun, but the slides truly don't stay on and the girls don't slide down, they fall off. The water makes a mess (I like the reviewer's idea about letting them play within the confines of the bathtub ... we turned this into a toy to be played with outside). Save your money and go with something else."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover...,I got this toy for my eighth birthday.It WAS NOT a fun trip putting it together.Sometimes it would even fall apart after all that work!But when it didn't fall apart and stuff it was quite fun.It made a big wet spot on my carpet and when my mom saw it she put it on a towel.Anyway I wouldn't really recomend it...unless you have patients BIG time patiens.
1,JUNK !!,"Do not waiste your money buying this piece of junk!! The pieces do not stay together,if you can put them together.The only thing we have left from this toy is the blow up pool that my daughter uses in the tub for a boat for her ducks."
2,Difficult to put together & keep it that way,"The toy was very difficult to put together. The pieces seemed like they didn't fit correctly. You almost need 4 hands to put it together. Very frustrating. After you get it together, the slides were very hard to get to stay on. My daughter had fun with it but I was continuously putting it back together for her. Because of the problem with it coming apart, she doesn't really play with it too much. It's more trouble than what it's worth."
1,"this ""castle"" is landfill","the fustrating slide comes in 5 snap together(over & over again)pieces. After using super glue, it still was an unfunctioning headache. The only smile this toy brought us was when I put it where it really belongs, the trash. We kept the blow up pool."
2,Terrible Polly Pocket,"Everyone do not buy this thing! I am someone who really likes Pollys but this is terrible! The only time I played with this the real way is once, and that's it! It's only fun when it's together and it's hard to put together so you hardly ever have fun with it. The doll is good. It's hard to fit the pieces together. From Hannah. PS. Remember, do not buy this toy."
1,"In my 6 year old Daughter's words...""What a piece of JUNK!""","I felt awful....she spent some of her birthday money on this toy and was in tears after 10 minutes of ""trying"" to play with it. Her frustration came from slides that won't stay together (no matter who tries to push them in), floating turtles for Polly to ride on that sink when you put a doll in them, a Polly that won't go down the slide unless you push her...and then she falls over the side at the top, rubber clothes that are not slit in the back for easy dressing and undressing, a sunhat that broke right away...I could go on forever!We have many, many Polly Pocket toys...this by far is the worst. I can guarantee you that no matter how COOL the newest Polly toy seems at Christmas time....THIS family will not be buying it....I'm 99% sure my daughter won't even ask...considering she wanted me to ""pack it up, take it back, this is nothing but junk!"" Her exact words.My advice....don't waste your money!"
2,Don't waste you $$$$$,"The box says Polly Pocket can ""race her friends down the slide"". Yeah sure. You have to push her down the slide which falls apart as she goes down. My sweet 5 year old wasted her birthday money on this and is so disappointed."
1,Does not work right from the minute out of the box!!!,My daughter was so excited to get this toy. We got it out of the box and it didn't go together right and didn't stay together. We threw the toy away and kept the inflatable swimming pool for other toy dolls. Total disappointment. They should give you money to take this toy off of their hands ;-(
1,A waste of money,"My daughter just received this item for her birthday. I am surprised the manufacturer was able to get one to stay assembled long enough to take the picture for the front cover. The slide consists of three platic components that are supposed to snap together. Each time you add the third piece, the first two fall apart. I have a little girl on the brink of tears because she cannot play with her new toy. Don't bother."
2,Wild Waves of Frustration,Impossible to fit together! Some of the pieces can be played with seperately.
4,Polly Pocket Slide Castle,I got this for my birthday and I really like it a lot. The hair changes color which is really cool. My mom had to put the slide together because it was way too hard for me to do. But other than that I like to play with it. I am 7 years old.
2,Fix the slide......,"This is one polly toy to skip. My daughter, 6 years, loved the idea of the pool. The whole slide contraption doesn't stay attached, so you end up fixing it constantly. Finally we ended up just playing with the blowup pool and skipping the whole slide thing. She could have done that in the bathtub."
1,Waste of money-falls apart,The slide will not stay together. The pegs for the slots in the front do not fit the pegs on the slide itself. My daughter has me putting it back together every couple of minutes. What a disappointment.
1,"Dont waste your money, this is junk!","If I could have given this toy a Zero, I would have! We opened it and after several attempts to get the slide to stay together, you can't even breath in its direction, thats no joke. We packed it back up and took it back to the store! I personally dont agree with glueing a toy soooo poorly made, if you dont take it back your not sending Mattel a clear message that consumers refuse to pay good money for such total junk!"
4,THIS TOY ROCKS!!!!!,"I'm a almost a teenage and still love to play with Pollys.I love this toy, it never got boring for me!(Because I have a good imagination) Some people said it's hard to put together but I think the opposite. It only took me a few tries to put it together. The slides are FUN and so are the pool and clothes. The only drawback waterfall doesn't really work though! I would say that girls from 4 to 12 years old would love this toy very much!!!!(...)"
5,Big hit!,"Let me start by saying that this wasn't the easiest toy to put together. The tab and slot slide fittings never really seemed to go together as they should for the slide, but it stays together fairly well with normal play. My daughter loves racing the dolls down the slide. We had to take off their rubbery swimsuits and just have them wear the ones painted on so they would slide down though. The swings are neat too. I put the whole thing in the bathtub (while it's empty) and give her a pitcher of water. She loves to sit in there and play with it and water doesn't get everywhere. The waterfall doesn't really function great, but it's ok and doesn't detract from the overall use of the toy. It's a big hit for us especially based on the cost."
1,Slide doesn't stay together,"This toy is really poorly made. The slide does not go together. my daughter has her heart set on playing with it, so I will glue it, but I'm not happy with the quality. I have been putting toys together sucessfully for 7 years - I am not inept - it is the toy's shoddy design, not my fault."
2,The slide does not stay together,"My three year old daughter loves Polly, but this particular toy is poorly made. The slots on the slide do not fit and broke after an hour of trying to put it together. We ended up gluing it together. I think that if the company made the toy already assembled and the slides one piece, it would be a terrific toy."
2,Pieces do not stay together!,"The slides do not go together as it should - and it's clearly not a single faulty unit. We're going to try superglueing it together as our daughter really wants this. Her other Polly Pocket toys in her collection are of much better quality, it seems to be just the slides... Talk your child into some other Polly POcket item than this one. Or buy glue ahead of time."
3,Ditto on the slide thing.....,"It could really be a fun toy if the slide did not keep falling apart everytime it was used or touched or even breathed on for that matter. I solved that problem though-I crazy glued the thing together and used nail filler to make it extra strong!!!! My daughter kept driving me nuts saying......""MOMMY THE SLIDE CAME OFF AGAIN COULD YOU FIX IT???!!!!"". Ever since I glued it, I no longer hear that preverbal statement. She enjoys the toy now with no problem."
3,Polly Pocket Wild Waves Castle,"My daughter is 5 1/2 and loves Polly Pocket. She loves this toy; however, the slides falls aparts all of the time. She doesn't even play with that part. My husband and I can't get the slide to stay together at all. It comes apart too easy. I don't know if I should exchange it for another. The swings are cute and the waterfall from the top is fun for her. I'm a little disappointed at the quality. The slide makes the toy and you can't even play with it."
2,A water mess,"I got this for my b-day. First, I found this very hard to set up. It takes about 20 min. just to put the slides together. When I get the slides together, the pollys do not slide down, and instead, they fall off. The water overflows, so I'm still trying to dry off my room. Don't buy it, instead, just get a basic set of Polly Pockets."
2,first of all boring!! theres more to see......,im 9 years old to tell you. well second of all its hard to put together!!! and plus you cant put it together!! if you do and put your polly on it your polly falls off the edge... third of all the pool is not even high and it over floods in a minute the water slides are bad!!!! i still use it and all its just i really cant
1,Impossible to Assemble,"This is the worst toy I have ever bought. My twins LOVE Polly Pocket and I usually don't have any problems with their playsets, but the Wild Waves Castle ended up being a disaster! I could NOT put it together and it actually BROKE while I was trying to assemble it. Don't bother with this playset - it only brings heartache!"
1,Don't bother,"Though Polly Pocket dolls are played with a lot in my house, the Wild Waves Castle was only used once. It is cumbersome when assembled, tippy, and doesn't work like it's supposed to. Because some water splashes from the slides, I put the base in a waterproof tray for play. Disassembled, it just sits there because it's not worth the trouble to snap it all back together again. This toy is an invitation for a mess of water on your floor and it's a pain to store."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This appears to be a really cute toy, but it doesn't stay together. I finally glued the slide together, but now it is not easy to store. My daughter likes it, but is also frustrated with the slide repeatedly falling apart. There are cuter Pollys out there!"
5,10 power eyeglass loupe,"This loupe works great for me. Flips up out of the way when not needed. I find it a great help in my new hobby of gem cutting, as would anyone who needs to do fine, detailed work. I highly recommend it."
4,Great refreshment course for this Norsworthy student,"While on a business trip five years ago in Valbonne France, I took two private lessons with Jon Norsworthy. He was the best golf instructor I have ever been to, no question about it.When I saw that there was a video with him, I had to get it. He's as good on film as in person. The only reason I didn't give the dvd five stars is because the two students he had, Ruth and Ramey, were very bad and gave the impression that this instruction is only for beginners. Jon's instruction is of benefit to experienced golfers and it would have been nice if one of his students was an accomplished golfer. Otherwise, this dvd was excellent and I'd recommend it to Norsworthy fans and those who'd like to find out what they're missing by not visiting the South of France."
1,Lost In Time,"These lessons are dated, out of touch and older than God. The clothes would be great for a retro party or Halloween...Keep looking."
3,I think that guy is overreacting,"This DVD is a rehash of old footage, but it is put together very solidly. I enjoyed the instructor's laid-back approach to learning golf. He suggests that when to start simply ""grip it and rip it."" I think that's a lot better than nit-picking every tiny thing I'm doing on the driving range. Also, it's quick to jump around to different sections, the golf jokes are ... well, golf jokes, and the trivia was interesting."
4,Jon Norsworthy fans will love it,"Great introduction to the game of golf. Designed for beginners who need to learn good habits from the start. Jon's teaching method, Natural Instinct, is designed to be intuitive for beginners and have an easier learning curve than other methods that force you into uncomfortable and awkward positions.In the video, you follow two rank amateurs as they learn the basics of the game. No matter how inexperienced you are as a golfer, trust me, the two students of Jon's are probably worse golfers than you are! Jon is great teacher and very entertaining, especially his section on trick shots."
2,Old Video in DVD format ---- Overpriced,The video was filmed in 1983. I'm not feeling happy to buy a 20 years old instruction at this price.
1,Good Golf is Easy,"Don't waster your money on this DVD. The picture quality and content are both very low quality. The movie's age shows (made in the 80s) and the there are far better instructional golf videos on the market. Whether you are novice or expert, if you want to improve your swing, you are better off spening your money on the driving range than than purchasing this DVD."
4,What a great program for beginners,"A delight for new golfers.I'm a beginning golfer, and I learned alot about golf and the fine courses in the South of France with this DVD.Jon Norsworthy is a really entertaining host and teacher--his trick shots are great and rival those of the ""Hitman"" series."
5,Best golf training method I've seen !,"This is a very novel approach to teach golf to beginners and even weekend golfers. It doesn't go through the mechanics of the grip, stance, back swing, etc., but at the end of the course, you have learned it all.I highly recommend it to anyone picking up a golf club for the first time and for those who have played for a while and can't break 100."
5,A Good Time Is Easy with Good Golf Is Easy,"At first I was skeptical of Good Golf is Easy. Now, I'm just plain delighted. John Norsworthy, the host of the program, is entertaining, charismatic, and knowledgeable of the game. You can tell he really loves teaching golf and that he REALLY loves the courses in the South of France. They truly are breathtaking. I would recommend this as a gift to any golf lover. The travelogue was very interesting as well. Five Stars!"
2,Too much blather and very little story,"After reading 100 pages I realized I was completely uninterested in the characters or the story, if there was one. Since I had expected to enjoy the book I decided to keep reading and hoped I'd be glad I did. So at 279 pages (over half way through) when nothing else had happened at all I decided to call it quits. Yeah, I understand lots of scene setting and intro to all the characters, etc. But for 279 (or more maybe)pages? The first half of this book seriously needed an editor to cut, cut cut. With about half of the verbiage cut out maybe I could have reached the part where the plot started. Because half-way through there was no evidence at all of any storyline."
5,"""Empire Falls"" Small Town America","""Empire Falls"" is an extremely well written book covering the inhabitants of a small New England town that has seen better days. It closely follows the lives of one particular family, the Robys, and their assosciation with the very wealthy Whiting family of Empire Falls. There are many businesses in this town but almost all of them revolve in some way around the Whiting family, even the ones not owned by them.The young people in the story and the problems they encounter at their high school are like those spelled out in so many news stories concerning tragedies that occur at so many schools. The charactors are very real whether they are the average town dweller or the wealthy members of the town. I would highly recommend this book of Americana to anyone."
3,An English viewpoint,"As a follower of literary prizes I was eager to read Russo's book - the winner of a Pulitzer. I have to say that it seems like an strange choice. The prose is pretty unremarkable and Russo takes five pages where one would do! Once I got the idea that nothing was going to happen, that the past was more important to Empire Falls, I enjoyed it.After all, Henry James was the master of that approach (not that Russo can hold a candle to James; then again, not many can). Ironically, it was only when the action began to pick up that the novel came across as false..."
2,"""Empire"" Falls Short","I will rarely abandon a book but I came close a few times on this one. Having seen the title pop up in respectable places (although I was unaware of its Pulitzer at the time of my purchase) I was disappointed in this book. The characters were unremarkable. Plot lines I hoped would develop - expected even - didn't while others dragged on endlessly. And, frankly, I tired of Russo's over-reliance on forced, misplaced, syrupy analogies. I gave Empire Falls 2 stars since it kept my mind occupied on long flights. Unfortunately, when I bought it I was hoping for my mind to be stimulated."
3,Only so so,"This is more of a ""mood"" book than a ""plot"" book. As other reviewers have noted, this book has an odd structure: about four-fifths of the book is devoted to setting the tone and background, and then all the plot seems to rush together at once in the final fifth. The main pleasures in the book, as in much good fiction, are little insights about life and human nature. I can't say this was a gripping page-turner for me, but I did find it a fairly enjoyable read. Maybe I just like ""plot"" books better than ""mood"" books, but I think a great book needs to succeed on both levels, and at the end of the day, I don't think this one does. So the upshot? Not a great book, but a well-done minor book."
3,Overrated and overwritten,"This book has some memorable characters, but suffers from repetitive writing and awkward metaphors.The main character, Miles, is forgettable, but his daughter, Tick, and mother, Grace, steal the show. A late-developing plot about an antisocial classmate of Tick's seems like it comes from another book, admittedly, a book where something actually happens instead of people sitting around talking and whining about their lost opportunities in life. And it's never hinted at why Miles married his wife or why his mother married his father."
2,"Pulitzer Prize Committee...""You're Fired!""","So saddened and disappointed by the fact this was chosen as a Pulitzer. Not entertaining. Boring. Kept thinking, this has to get better, doesn't it? Nope, it didn't. Empire Falls...Down."
2,Gothic potboiler,"Astonished that this book has recieved such favorable reviews - this guy is mining a territory he has in fact forgotten - he's now Martha's Vineyard, not Empire Falls. His characters are cardboard, and that plot is worthy of a Springer show. Good God."
2,My first and last Russo book,"Russo's character development is good, but the characters were dull, and not that funny (although I think that was the intention.) The ending felt rushed, and it was a real let down. After 400+ pages, I expected more, especially since I wasn't 'hooked' into the book until page 200. There were no surprises, it was very predictable - it felt as though Russo was letting us in on secrets that most readers would have figured out 100 pages earlier."
2,Not deserving of the Pulitzer,"This was a lousy book. Poor prose, unremarkable characters, a tedious plot. I barely finished it. Go out and read Yann Martel's marvelous Life of Pi instead. That's the book that should have won the Pulitzer in 2002."
2,Pulitzer Shmulitzer,"Without the underhanded assistance of the venal French Ice Skating judge I cannot imagine how this book won a Pulitzer Prize. The writing is incredibly sloppy and the forward motion is glacial. Yes, there are some interesting and likeable, if somewhat exaggerated, characters, but I got so tied up in the author's misuse of words (""inference"" and ""vagaries"" are only two glaring examples) and apparent misunderstanding of the proper use of tenses in the English language, so weary of his sentences going on long after they'd purged themselves of useful information, that I simply did not care. Where the heck was his editor???"
1,I wish I could recommend this book,"I tried three times to get into this book. I found the book a bore. It reminded my of a book I often had to read for a sociology or psychology course and then discuss the motives, thoughts, and desires of the people involved. It definately is not a story -- it is a study of mal-adjusted, unhappy people. There is no real action or anything to grab the reader into the story in the first 100 pages. At that point I felt I was wasting my time and reading something I did not like. NOT A SUMMER READING BOOK FOR THE BEACH. Not a page turner. I realize it won an award, but often the critic delights are not the readers."
2,Couldn't even finish,"I didn't pick up this book because it won a Pulitzer, ratherit came highly recommended by a friend who usually has good taste in books. I was unimpressed with the story in general, but mostly with Russo's writing style. The part that I read seemd very forced; every line an obvious attempt by Russo to come across as ""witty"" and ""humorous"". Perhaps my dislike has something to do with the fact that I had just finished reading ""East of Eden""....a superior book by a far superior writer."
2,My least favorite Russo,"I've loved Richard Russo novels since 'Mohawk', but perhaps I've finally OD'd. This one was an awful slog and I almost gave up, reading several other books in between attempts.Time for a new formula; Russo has worn out the poor schlemiel just barely making it through life in some northeast backwater theme. Perhaps if you haven't already read 'Nobody's Fool' and 'The Risk Pool' and 'Straight Man'...?"
4,A Very Engaging Read,"Empire Falls, like most Pulitzer Prize winners that I have read, is very place and plot centered. Russo is very adept at painting a picture of a small, blue collar New England town that is slipping from prosperity into oblivion. This slip portrayed in both the town and its citizens. Following the plight of the whole cast of charatcers was fascinating and engaging.However, the plot was rather predictable. I was disappointed that so many of the twists were predictable, making them lose some of their punch. Also, the ending left me with an incomplete feeling - and then what happened?I definitely recommend reading Empire Falls. It is a fast read and very well written. Unfortunately, for me, it left me feeling a bit unfulfilled."
3,Revview over Empire Falls,"""I mean, if I were so unhappy, wouldn't I know?"" asks Miles Roby, the hero of ""Empire Falls,"" The answer, of course, is not necessarily, and one of Russo's greatest ideas is to make us understand how a 40-year-old man can not recognize his own quiet desperation and then make us believe that his life can change for the better. Along the way, Russo gives us a fantastic and not yet great review over the town of Empire Falls, Maine, showing how the history of one powerful family can become the history of a place. It's the kind of big, sprawling, lad back novel, full of plots and lots of characters, that people are always complaining is an endangered species. Yet in part thanks to Russo's great touch -- much of the book is laugh-out-loud funny -- it never feels too slow or old-fashioned."
2,Nobody's Fool,"I'm Nobody's Fool and, unfortunately, neither is this book - not even close. Unfortunately also, he tries, quite carelessly, to reprise Fool in many ways. A bad go from conception to completion. Maybe just a shot at making a buck - who knows.Always a bad sign when the publisher can find no reviews from substantial sources from which to quote.A big dissapointment but, from the stars already assigned by readers, clearly one can fool most of the people some of the time."
1,Ugh,This is a hopelessly conventional novel written in featureless prose worthy of a government document. I'm tempted to invite the members of the Pulitzer committee over to paint my house since they're clearly not suited for the job they're doing.How about something subtle and artful for next year's award -- a piece of fiction in between the bombastic lyricism of Kavalier and Clay and the thuddingly workmanlike prose of Empire Falls? This reader would celebrate the change.
1,Sorely Disappointing,"I have read all Russo's novels. ""The Risk Pool"" is minor realist classic literature. ""Nobody's Fool"" and ""Mowhawk"" were very good, traditional mid-list reads, like the books of John Hassler. I ran out to buy his books in hardback. I thought ""Straight Man,"" another mediocre academic novel, was an aberration-it wasn't. I wonder if he wrote the movie (or made-for-TV) script in tandem for ""Empire Falls""? It is the weakest link. The main character's model was probably Charlie Brown. This novel is so dull it could have been concocted by a marketing team, except that even a marketing team would have insisted on better editing to hasten the lumbering prose in the first two-thirds of the book. I feel personally betrayed by Russo; so few write convincingly about working class people. But he's another brand name now and can continue to write dull fare and make money. For what it's worth, he's off this reader's list."
1,This won a Pulitzer!?,"This trite piece of fluff won a Pulitzer? While reading Empire Falls you might have the sensation that you've met all the players and their problems before, in my opinion that's because you have. There is nothing remotely new or engaging about this book. But that's not all- this book comes complete with sterotypical characters, syrupy dialogue, and an spectacularly bad 'movie of the week' ending. If you have more than two brain cells left I suggest you find another book..."
2,I wish the empire had fallen in less words!,"I love reading, in fact I often write it down as my favorite hobby. The truth is though, no matter how much I love reading I seem to love procrastinating even more! I wasn't surprised (neither was anybody else who knows me) to find that the last week before school I was still not done with this book (sorry Larry). I don't however believe that reading this novel quickly was the reason that I did not find it ""enjoyable"" to say the least! I felt that becuase of its INCREDIBLE length the actual story ended up drowned under pages of unecessary words. I don't regret it but I don't recommend it either. If nothing else however at least I can say it didn't fail to show me once again that procrastination should really stop being my #1 hobby!"
1,"Stink, Stank, STUNK","I have tried three times to read this book............I found this book very boring. Ok, the Moosehead got a little chuckle, but that is as far as it goes. I can not figure out what all the hype is about. I know there are better books out there to read with my time. Don't waste yours."
2,glad it's over,"I am at a loss to find one character, or one plot-line in this book, that wasn't an overused, overwritten cliche. From the evil stepmother/witch-figure Mrs Whiting (complete with evil feline sidekick), to the beautiful Grace Roby from the wrong side of the tracks, to the ex-wife Janine who finds that losing weight and her ex-husband can't buy her happiness, I was really relieved when this book ended saving me from any more tedious dialogue from Mr. Russo."
2,How on earth did this book win a Pullitzer?,"True to most formerly intelligent things in this country, it appears we've dumbed down our standards once again. In my opinion this book is one step above Steven King. True the characters are well defined, but the dialogue is terribly written, and the plot is utterly predictable. If you're looking for award winning fiction that will challenge you intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually, this is NOT the book for you. The Pullitzer people should take some lessons from the Booker people, and pick out some real literature for the prize, not brain candy like this book."
2,Reading the movie,"I must admit that the diner on the cover and the wild success of Russo's book put me off. I enjoyed Russo's sense of humor and admired Miles Roby, the main character, but reading this light novel was like watching a respectable American movie. It was perfectly well done, but it didn't linger for much longer than the ride home. The teenage subplot was the most disappointing part - in the early chapters Russo struck a balance between his memory of high school and his observation of the current scene, but in the climax he sacrificed both without taking us any deeper into the nightmare with which he replaces them. He's at his best when he's exploring the bittersweet life of a mill town without a mill, but in the end fiction takes over. As result, I quickly forgot what I liked about the book in the first place. I'm sure the movie will be fine."
5,Bonza!,"Chomping through parts of America via quality fiction is one of my favorite hobbies as an ex-patriot American in Australia.I have enjoyed all of Russo's books and think my favorite Russo is always the one I have just finished.Empire Falls lived up to all of my expectations. I thought the characters to be real, appealing, strongly developed and inspiring of empathy. A very satisfying ending with strong pathos and humour throughout the pages. Thanks Richard!"
5,A great book.,"I enjoy a good story. Character development is nice, but the story has to move along. This book does both. I only rate books I really enjoy and that, two months later, I'm still remembering scenes and characters. This is one of those. This is my third book by Russo. He's up with Irving as my favorite contemporary writers."
3,Not my cup of tea,"While the writing style is excellent, I just didn't go for the plot. I wondered why I didn't like this very popular book. Here's what I came up with: I could not identify with Miles, a really decent guy who doesn't make any big decision or plan his way out of the poor situation he's in. The bullying going on in this little town was too obvious, too simple, I thought. Worst, I felt there was nothing lasting from the book - no lessons learned, knowledge gained or new feeling felt."
4,Love/Hate Relationship,"I love this book. I absolutely loathe this book. Years after I read it, it still sticks with me. The characters, story, scenery are downright perfect. The dialogue is unmatched, and I was transported to this world. However, this has the absolute worst ending of any book I have ever read. In fact, when other stories go to the same place, I now say, ""Wow! They went for the Empire Falls ending!!!"" If literature is supposed to get a reaction out of a reader, then it certainly did with me. Unfortunately, my reaction was throwing the book across the room when I got to the ending. Cursing myself, I went back and read it again and again...."
3,A beautiful book with a forced ending,"Almost to the end this novel is one or Russo's best, with one of his most appealing protagonists, one of his best-drawn comic old pensioners, and a complex structure that plays in Faulknerian fashion with time within narrow confines of place. Then it all blows apart, in about thirty-five pages of conclusion that substitute cinematic 'action' and a forced relevance to recent events for the character and situation and internal development that he's best at. It left me wondering why. Perhaps to make it more palatable to Hollywood, as a previous reviewer suggested? I'm bitterly disappointed, because most of this book is even better than the Russo book I like best, The Risk Pool, and certainly more ambitious than any of his previous novels. Perhaps he should do as Fowles did in The Magus, and retool the book for a second version. In any case, he should replace the baldly sensationalist, topical ending---or simply delete it. Alas."
5,60 Is No Magic Number,"Russo achieves rare depth of character in ""Empire Falls."" His depictions are so vivid that soon you feel Empire Falls is your own hometown--one you need to get out of. His candid portraits zero in on humanity's frailties and strengths. After a couple of hundred pages, I started to worry that Russo was offering random vignettes as he switched from the daughter to the high school principal to the neighborhood priest and back to Miles, the main character. But Russo writes disciplined fiction which is very much on purpose. Each character's viewpoint is a necessary contribution to the whole. The novel is so beautifully crafted that even when it needed to end, I didn't want it too. Special highlights include Miles' driving lessons (my own were only slightly less traumatic) and Janine's growing disillusionment with her husband-to-be, who is much older than he leads her to believe."
2,"Hmmm, not so sure about this one","Richard Russo is considered a great author, heck, he is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Yet, somehow this book didn't measure up to my expectations. I found Empire Falls to be a very uninteresting read, in which you always knew where the author was headed about 20 pages before he arrived at his destination."
4,A Comment on the Duality of Man,"Russo's characters were fascinating in that they never seemed to leave the reality he established ...They were intriguing and real, not necessarily elegant, refined, or graceful. This roughness around the edges gave certain situations a realness is especially important in a small town setting. Miles' character was particularly well developed, humorous, and had his personal failures intact. I loved the relationship between the apprehensive Miles and his spontaneous father Max. My objection though is to the ending of the novel. The banality of the small town could've held its own with a subtly dramatic ending. The ending felt contrived, or too meaningful, symbolic, preachy, or something. Overall though, definitely worth reading."
4,A Master of Characterization,"Chances are, in Richard Russo's ""Empire Falls,"" there is someone in this story that you can either empathize with or someone that reminds you of someone you once knew. Russo is a master of characterization and in ""Empire Falls,"" you cannot help but fall under the spell of at least a few of his characters in this engaging story. This is a story that could be actually taking place/have taken place anywhere in Smalltown USA. Russo's story is believable and the characters all have flaws that anyone could have, and that's probably the best thing about this story. It's not pretentious and it's believable, yet comedic and dramatic at the same time."
4,a GOOD not GREAT book,"I really liked this novel, but it was occasionally slow in some places, contrived in others. Still, it is so much better than 99% of the books being published now. Russo has real heart and real humor. If you want something similar to this, but even stronger, even more touching and more funny and wild and true, pick up Brady Udall's THE MIRACLE LIFE OF EDGAR MINT. It's a truly great book and does all the the things Empire Falls does, only better."
5,Outstanding,"The characters will stay with you. Nothing feels rushed in this book, read it when you have time to appreciate it. I was impressed by Russo before reading Empire falls, now I'm awestruck."
2,everything falls apart,"That sums up the message of the novel and its presentation.Empire Falls starts out as a mildly interesting character piece. The author plays out the interactions of a diverse set of characters and avoids easy judgemental pitfalls. I was intrigued by the very low level of sexuality displayed by all of the characters. Even the ex-wife in her single-minded pursuit of the perfect orgasm is only narcisistic, not sensual.Having introduced us to a community that is collectively, individually, and unanimously rotting away, Russo finally must confront the fact that there can be no satisfactory conclusion. To close out the novel, he drops the characterization (leaving lots of dangling issues) and substitutes a series of contrived, pulp-fiction plot devices (too many and too stupid to list here). The last page left me with fitting image of a town and a novel flushed down the sewer together."
4,The male climax,"I had one problem with this simple, subtle, wide, wise novel,and that was the climax, too violent, too out of tone, tooout of touch with small-town America. It reminded me of the climax of Dubus's House of Sand and Fog, gratuitousgore in the midst of nuance. Why do male writers insist onjolting their gentle readers out of all relation to their stories?"
3,"Ponderous, But in a Good Way","The narrative is as languid as the story's New England setting. But the characters are very well drawn, and I slogged through all 483 pages to see how their dramas were resolved. This guy wrote Nobody's Fool. If you read it or saw the movie with Paul Newman, you've got the vibe."
2,"Plot, what plot?","If you are looking for a book with an ending, don't bother with this one.After seemingly endless development of characters and environment Mr Russo decided that he had better things to do rather than develope a plot.When action finally does occur his characters all act out of character and the book ends without satifaction from the point of view of characters, history or feasible plot.One of the most dissapointing reads I have had for a long time."
2,John Irving Lite,"Russo gets credit for being a brillaint writer. 'Straight Man' and 'Nobody's Fool' were excellent novels, creating characters and worlds i still recall fondly.But let's face it, this is a beach read.An Oprah book.The problem is, Oprah's book club is out of business.russo aspires to the dizzying heights of a John Irving novel. A small town, quirky characters. Ah, yes, but Irving novels (when good) have deeper meaning. (Is Owen Meany God? Does feminism destroy women? Is abortion ethical?)This novel's meaning is sadly trite: small town life is disintigrating--but it can be SAVED BY A CREDIT CARD COMPANY?I'm not sure Russo even sees the irony in his own Hollywood ending. These are the same comapnies who lay off his characters by the tens of thousands in real life.Its sad. The characters are well rounded but we've met them all before.If this were a first novel, it would have been edited to ribbons."
3,Disappointing,Having enjoyed immensely both Straight Man and Nobody's Fool I expected more. At times I felt like I was reading a draft and the flashback chapters were downright schmaltzy! I look forward to reading more inspired Russo work in the future.
3,THIS won a Pulitzer??,"A few years back I read ""Empire Falls'"" jacket blurb and rejected it out of hand... even the publisher's glowing synopsis promised little more than a soap opera.Then I read Russo's ""Nobody's Fool"" and decided to give ""...Falls"" a look. How could someone who created such unforgettable characters -- be they charming or irascible -- all bound together in such a delightful and thoroughly believable story as ""...Fool"", EVER write a bad novel?Not that ""Empire"" is BAD. But it's hard to escape the thought that leftover situations and dialogue from the earlier ""... Fool"" were used in ""...Falls"" (not to mention the cliched characters). And any time I skim page after page midway through a story, it's definitely lost my attention.My first impression was right ... it IS a soap opera."
2,I wanted to like it,"I would rather stare blankly into space on than try to read this book during my morning commute. I painfully labored with the first few pages before allowing myself to skip to Chapter 1. I tried to get involved. I tried to get interested. I tried to figure out where the plot would pick up. After an entire week of trying to muster interest in ""Empire Falls,"" I decided that that I'd rather leave it in my pocket book than be bothered with trying to determine where the story was going. It's a shame because Russo's ""Straight Man"" is also sitting on my ""to read"" pile."
2,hard to read,"I read all the time and there are lots of books that I have enjoyed, but this is not one of them. I thought it might be interesting because I grew up in Maine, but I found the book extremely hard to read. It was much too wordy and kept jumping around from the present to the past. The ending eventually pulled together the mystery of the book, but it could have been written with less words and in a way that was more captivating. The book had me mildly interested, but this writer will never be an author that I will go back to reading in the future."
1,Over the top,"I started out liking the book but by the time I finished I kind of lost interest. The revelation of why C.B. Whiting took his own life,etc. - it didn't ring true to me. Plus the author has everything in the book but the kitchen sink!"
4,INTERESTING BUT A BIT PREDICTABLE,I enjoyed the characters and story line quite a lot. Read it a few months ago and it resignates well in my memory. Great sense of place and hopelessness.
2,disappointed,"This is the first Russo book I have read and might be the last. Actually I have not finished it yet and have been trying to do so for the last 2 1/2 months. The book is very well written and the story does indeed give a look at everyday life. I however found it rather boring. The book is not engrossing in the least...I have to really work hard to convince myself to pick it. Once I do start reading it again it is mildly entertaining, but as a mother of three small children I really need a book to draw me in or else it is not worth my time. This book did not draw me; I found the character development rather lacking."
1,Lightweight and banal,"When I heard that Richard Russo's ""Empire Falls"" won the Pulitzer Prize and was about blue-collar life, I was expecting something a lot more serious and with a harder edge. I was disappointed to discover that it's lightweight fluff. Some of the characters and situations are not to be believed. Miles Roby, the angst-ridden main character, is defined by his relationship to the various women in his life. I just didn't care about the characters or situations. This book reminded me a lot of Richard Ford's ""Independence Day,"" another book I didn't care for. Is this really the best fiction of the year?"
1,What a bore...,"Adequately written at best, no action, predictable. If I wasn't the kind of person who always finishes a book I start, this one would of found it's way to the wastebasket early on, but I kept reading in the hope that it would get better. It didn't!This was good only as a time filler on the subway."
3,doldrum to the end but well written,Continual events that were not plausible with an ending that leaves you hanging but not wanting more. Did not see the point.
4,"Not a page turner, but....","While this wasn't a page turner for me, I was compelled by the story. I found myself drawn into the intricately woven characters. Empire Falls isn't a simple book...it requires that one buy into it, and I found I HAD to finish it. The characters are realistic, and after all is said and done,I have to admit that I loved the story. Again, it wasn't a page turner, but it wasn't an empty novel either. There's a lot going on, here. It's definitely worth the read! When compared with other novels that my group is sharing, I have to say that this one stands out as a full bodied read, something I can sink my teeth into."
3,russo blows the layup,"i like richard russo and i liked this book, which is more ambitious than his other books, but the ending, as other reviewers have noticed, is really unsatisfactory. the trouble is he uses too many characters. some are really good, like max and the senile priest, but others are not so good. in particular, the murderous repressed boy just goes down like a rock in the middle of your oatmeal. mostly, the story wants to be about the clash between miles and mrs. whiting, about the meek little good guy vs the wicked witch of the west, and he never does get there. instead, as miles is going to confront mrs. whiting in what should be the climax of the book, russo gets diverted into the slapstick of a fistfight with the book's most overwritten and cliche-shaped villain, the crooked cop. i like russo but he'll write better books."
3,Charming but a bit slow moving...,"I am not one to keep reading a book that has lost my interest, and I almost stopped reading ""Empire Falls"" because, it certainly isn't action packed. But based on the reviews I read here I kept at it. The pace did quicken about 1/3 way through, and I started to enjoy the ""Northern Exposure""-esque quirky characters and dialog. But the tragic twist near the end just put me off. There's too much of THAT kind of violence in reality (I won't give it away but the other readers will know what I'm referring to) and it just didn't seem to fit with the 80% of the story I had previously read. Anyway, it wasn't a waste of time but it wasn't that great either. I appreciate Russo's style but the story just wasn't that enjoyable for me."
5,A Well Crafted Tale,"This the first book by Richard Russo that I have read. The characters are richly drawn and very real. The book's pacing and prose are suberb. I found myself purposefully slowing down my reading in the last 100 pages, savoring the story and the characters."
3,Involving but unoriginal,"There is no denying that I was caught up in the lives of these characters and I read through the book fairly quickly so I would say that it will keep your interest. I could'nt shake the idea that the whole thing seemed just too familiar though.The downtrodden protagonist,the all powerful villian controlling the entire town. Now that I think about it lets see--the hero has to come home from college and afterwards can't escape his small town,he has to battle evil in the form of the towns richest person--should'nt the name of this be Bedford Falls? While it is a good read and not as upbeat as ""It's A Wonderful Life"" this is clearly not an original story. More likely a case of someone getting lazy and recycling a story he's heard before. Maybe that could slip by if you don't pick a story everyone in the world is familiar with."
2,It bored me to sleep,"How many times can a writer use the phrases ""After all"" and ""of course"" in a 500 page book and still win a Pulitzer? Apparently, about 500. The writing in this book is lethally dull, the characters are uninteresting and the plot limps along until the very end when it commits suicide. Puh-leeze."
3,Readable,"Life in a derelict New England milltown. Readable? Yes, but not mesmerizing. Hard to argue with the Pulitzer Prize, but, frankly, the characters were weak-kneed and not particularly likeable; kept hoping someone would show a little spunk but it didn't happen."
3,Empire Falls - decent slice of small-town life,"Empire Falls is an honest, heartfelt tale of small-town life in rural Maine. At its center is protagonist Miles Roby, a diner manager who'd hoped for more in life but has become resigned to putting himself in lose-lose situations. Revolving around him are a cast of humorous, obnoxious, troubled, and sometimes tragic characters - including Miles's pickpocket father, a pathetically insecure local health club owner, a priest with Alzheimer's who loves nothing more than sharing the intimate details of his parishioners' confessions, and a bitter old woman who owns everything in town.These and other characters fill Miles's past and present, observing and sometimes contributing to the rise and fall of the town, as well as to Miles's success and failures in his own battles with the demons of his past."
2,What a disappointment!!,"Was so relishing reading this book as I'd heard such great things about it....and it won the Pulitzer of course. What a disappointment! It's literature light, really. I found the characters annoying and utterly unlikable. I was hoping bad things would happen to them, especially Miles who was not at all sympathetic but rather annoying and shallow. Russell Banks gets small town blue collar life much better than this. It was like a made-for-tv-movie in book form. How did this win the Pulitzer??"
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"having read other books by richard russo, i thought this would be great (it did win the pulitzer). big disappointment. unlike his other work, this is much more self-indulgent and wordy. i loved STRAIGHT MAN which i would recommend to anyone as one of the best books i've read by russo or any other writer. by comparison, EMPIRE FALLS was a huge letdown."
5,One of the best that I have read... ever,"It seems to amaze me when I can read a book in which seems like everyday life and find it so deep with movement. This book seems like the life of so many people that you know or in parts the life of your own. But even so, you can't help to continue even when you think that you know what will happen next. We are talking about life and therefore whatever we think may be coming next is never what we know. This book is that way, reading it involves expecting the unexpected. As with life, you can never be too sure what you will get. But taking a chance to see into someone elses life will usually better you, even if you have to go through some hardships and life lessons to get there."
3,How did this get a Pulitzer?,"My book group read this and the consensus was that it's a mediocre book. The characters are pretty well developed, so if that's all you want in a book, this will be fine. But if you want plot or a book with a big idea, this isn't it. The flashbacks are engaging--probably the best segments. The rest of the writing is okay, but not great. Russo repeats things over and over, as if he thinks you've forgotten what he wrote a couple of chapters back. The heavy handedness is particularly tedious when it comes to key plot points. It wouldn't be so bad, except that the book is long and could use a good edit. And the way he ends feels totally false and soap opera-ish, like, okay, time to end the book. Everyone was shocked that he got a Pulitzer for this. Maybe it felt right when he wrote it, but in that case it hasn't aged well.Overall, it was like watching a TV miniseries."
2,Falls Flat,"Sorry, I have to be the dissenting voice here. It is an extremely rare occurence that I give up on a book and I am dangerously close to putting Empire Falls back on my roommate's book shelf. There may be a good story somewhere in the next 300 pages, but it'd really have to be something spectacular to justify plodding through the vapid writing.Russo likes to hit the reader over the head, tell you instead of show you, and repeat the obvious three and four times. Perhaps a real character will develop by the second half of the book, but thus far I am looking at a cast of caricatures painted with broad strokes, engaged in conversations that sound nothing like natural human dialogue.I have a feeling that Empire Falls' popular acclaim is largely attributable to its willingness to tackle a difficult issue of concern to many in this country -- school violence. It will not survive as a classic, and, less importantly, it will not survive as the book I read on the subway for the rest of the week."
3,Humor Saves It,"Russo sanitizes the working class for middle-class intellectuals, confirming their bias, and pandering to their tastes with a carefully sensitive, slightly condescending viewpoint. His characters have a quality of caricature, which works nicely with the humor, but real emotion is completely lacking. The ending seemed grafted on to the book merely to make it topical.Tick is a wonderful character--Russo writes teens very well--but her intuitiveness failing her with the troubled boy seems implausible. The boy himself is a misleading character, changing uncomfortably as the book neared its end. The book is exhaustingly long without adequate payoff. Still, Russo is wonderfully funny in places and this kept me alive as a reader."
4,A Wonderful Character Study,"Interesting what different people think after reading the same book, isn't it?I really enjoyed Empire Falls. I found the characters wondefully developed, and the narrative pleasantly paced. I eagerly anticipated each reading session. OK, yeah, in retrospect perhaps the ending WAS a bit too melodramatic. But at the time, hey... I was [pulled] in and enjoyed every page.Strongly recommended."
5,a can't put it down read,"This book is about an economically depressed community in Maine and the interaction of the residents. The development of the characters is marvelous and makes it a joy to read because it seems that in each character you can somehow relate to their foibles and their folly. I enjoyed reading this book, cover to cover."
4,Small Town America,"Small Town personalities and challenges with universal appeal:School violence, teenage angst, divorce, struggling economic times, the price of wealth, the difficulty of being a parent.I don't think this book has necessarily Pulitzer Prize material, but was definitely an interesting and complicated story with likeable but flat characters. The play was multi-layered with different periods of time and phases of life. Basically, Empire Falls is a story of people who are trying to deal with the inconsistencies in their dreams, realities, and things outside their control."
2,Not for me,"I got so bored and frustrated with this book, I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and searched the internet for a summary. And I'm glad I did! Empire Falls is a hefty read with lots of details and side plots that barely begin to weave together for more than half the book. Boring? For me, it was. Meandering is a good term. I'm also partial to happy endings, I think struggle should be rewarded with triumph. This book had very little triumph. It offered pain and suffering over two generations of characters in a small, middle America town that is past it's heyday. So completely predictable. I can still hear the character Janine complaining of never having an ""O"" after 20 years of marriage. This book never climaxed for me either. I just wanted to scream at them to wake up and get a life!"
5,wonderful!,"What a great novel this is. A good friend gave this to me, and I finally got around to reading it and loved all of it. All the praise is justified."
5,Storytelling of the highest caliber,"Richard Russo has a wonderful way of weaving words, particularly when revealing the thoughts of his rich, authentic characters. And he is a master at creating a sense of place. While reading Empire Falls that's precisely where you feel you are living for the book's duration. This novel was a delight to read and I'll be sure to check out more of Russo's books. Highly recommended to all. Need I say more?"
3,creates a realistic world but ultimately disappoints,"As a storyteller who can spin characters and atmosphere, Russo is pretty talented, and he did remind me of John Irving and even Pat Conroy just in the way he created a world that you want to spend time in. But his plotting is less sophisticated; he builds up tension and characters without appropriate payoff, and gives payoffs to insufficiently developed characters. More balance is needed, and a little less exposition of his themes. Some mystery about the author's message might have hidden some of the plot problems--I would have filled in the gaps. The characters, some of whom I really loved (though several were too caricatured), deserved better. The book is disappointing because of the unfulfilled promise of the raw materials, but probably worth reading just for the two thirds that is done right."
3,Pleasant midbrow novel,"I genuinely enjoyed Empire Falls and thought much of it was entertaining with many likable characters and interesting situations. I also thought the ending (the catastrophe at the end) was a terrible novel-writing decision -- such an event is the focus of the plot, not some ancillary byproduct that helps to resolve the situation.It's really more of a midbrow novel -- some serious themes mixed in with easy-to-digest writing and colorful characters -- not that there is anything wrong with that! Also, proves the Pullitzer is a purely political award, since there is no way this decent book would have won it other than through lobbying. In sum, I would actually recommend it but lower your expectations and you will be rewarded."
4,Life in a mill town in Maine,"This town with its polluted river, its decaying main street and declining businesses is all too familiar to this reader. I grew up in just such a town although the high school scenes are obviously drawn from the present--even down to the horrific climax that has become too familiar in our own times. Russo does know that generation very well, as far as I can tell.Miles Roby is too much of the anti-hero, the loser, but the reader never loses sympathy for Miles even when he seems to be his own worst enemy (not counting Mrs. Whiting). At first he makes the ex-wife despicable, but Russo manages to show even her complexities.I would give it five stars, except that the author seems to muddy the religious theme, especially when John Voss is suggested as a Christ figure, who seemed to be at the center of the trouble and then mysteriously disappeared. Jesus did not decide to take violent revenge on his enemies."
4,A Great Read,"This is a great read, with characters so vividly brought to life, you'll feel you've known them all your life. Mr. Russo has the wonderful ability to tell a story with adding humorous asides that will often leave you chuckling out loud."
3,"Very Good, but reads like a screenplay","This is the first Richard Russo book I've read. It is highly entertaining, the characters are portrayed so well that you get to 'know' them after a while. The story itself is great: a small town in Maine that's going downhill fast; the hero runs the run-down local diner: a loser in most things material but a possible winner in the most important thing of all. I won't spoil it for those who have not read it by getting into plot details. My only minor complaint is that I kept on reading the dialogue as spoken words in a film. I suppose that's what you get for doing so well to familiarize the reader with the characters. It WOULD make an interesting film, with Kevin Costner as the forlorned hero, Wilford Brimly as his dad, etc, etc. Very good read, I'll look for other Russo works at the local library."
3,He's done better ...,"Risk Pool and Straight Man I'd give five stars, but this offering disappointed. You knew soon as characters with names like David and Miles appeared that this wasn't to be the gritty reality of the aforementioned. The pace was hurried, the characters shallow and the plot lacked credibility. Russo writes well, but he can do better .... a good one to get at the library later."
2,Stock Characters = Pulitzer???,"You know how with some books you have to read some sentences over and over because they are so amazingly written? Or because they make you marvel at their wittiness? Or they make a philosophical or spiritual point that takes you by surprise and makes you think? Or you just delight in the originality and spare or lush beauty of the prose?This is not one of those books. If you tend to mentally edit redundancy or banality out of less-than-wonderful writing, you will find this annoying.The stock characters are one dimensional, some to the point of caricature. You can put almost every one in the Good or Bad column and leave them there. There are subcolumns for Heart of Gold, Cantankerous, Cantakerous Heart of Gold, Cartoonishly Boorish, etc. None of them evolve, although Miles, the main character, [SPOILER] discovers he has been duped, and his ex-wife's weight fluctuates. The two stars is generous!"
3,Fair,The story feels contrived and forced in places. Nobody's Fool is much much better. I could never understand the allure that this book held for so many.
5,one of my favorite books,it deserved the Pulitzer prize. very well written and very insightful. i recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a good book to read.
3,"Good, not Great","This is a leisurely and expansive novel, good for a rainy day or day at the beach. It tells the story of a few families in a dying industrial town in Maine. The central character is a benighted and good hearted fellow with an adolescent daughter who is easy to like and care about. Members of this family learn from their mistakes and are able to change course when certain truths are revealed. Not so the two ""bad"" families where the males tend to repeat the damaging ways of their forebears, in ways that hurt the good family and hurt the town. The rather simplistic division of good guys vs. bad guys keeps ""Empire Falls"" from being a really good book, and a surprise to me that it was a Pulitzer Prize winner."
2,Pulitzer Prize?,"I can't figure out why this one the Pulitzer, unless it was a dry year for novels. I felt a steady, low-level of enjoyment throughout this book. I didn't find the characters compelling or the story particularly engaging. I liked the book enough to finish it but wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,Are they just giving Pulitzers away?,"While I'd never read a book by Richard Russo before this, I can't say I feel compelled to read any of his other works after reading Empire Falls. While the first hundred pages or so introduced some interesting characters, the next several hundred pages were painfully slow, and I became progressively impatient with the characters and the plot for the next several hundred pages, as I awaited the novel's predictable ending. Eventually the ending came, and I was glad when it did."
2,Too many words!,I can't believe that I managed to finish this book. There were way too many words - I kept getting lost in the prose and waiting for something - anything - to happen. I am not sure why I persisted - I guess I kept thinking (hoping)that it would get better. The story could have been quite good - if he hadn't taken pages to say what could have been said in a couple of paragraphs. This was truly a disappointing novel.
3,Good - not great,"Interesting book - however, you just wanted everyone to wake up and LIVE! It seemed to me that everyone was existing without living. I suppose that was part of the point - but it was so sad.This book made me want to eat with my hands, dance in the rain, sing out loud in public - just break through the boredom and DO something."
1,Disappointing...Couldn't Finish,"I received this book as a gift with a great recommendation. After 125 pages, I had to finally let it go. Reading it was like watching grass grow. I like plots with some action or interesting things happening, so this is not the book for me..."
1,It would make a better movie than a book,"I bought this book thinking I would like it because I enjoyed the movie NOBODY'S FOOL, but I was mistaken. This book would make an interesting movie but as a book it is just too slow. Nothing happens and the author only writes about the little things. Not even in the present most of the time. It gives the reader the false illusion that we are getting to know the protagonist and his past so that something extraordinary will happen--I gave up waiting for taht event half way through the book and have never been tempted to pick it up again."
1,the empire's new clothes?,Pulitzer Prize? Hogspit! This is four hundred eighty pages of sentimental drivel which no one bothered either to edit or proofread. A dozen loathsome cardboard characters. A story utterly contrived. Russo apparently has everybody fooled. Some publisher chose him to introduce the stories of Richard Yates. He should read them again.
3,20-something Chicago woman,"I read this because my book club selected it. Russo's writing style was enjoyable and he describes the small-town characters well, but it wasn't really my type of book. Meaning, I can identify with 20 and 30 something female authors a lot better than a 40 something man. The next best charatcers I had to identify with: teenage daughter and 40 something woman. It's not my kind of book, but I will suggest it to a 40 something man I know who is going through a divorce."
1,Difficult read,"Our book club agrees... we don't see what all the raves are about. It took me so long to finally get past the first couple chapters without falling asleep. Once I did, I found it depressing and dull. I had to force myself to finish this book because of book club. There were some colorful characters that added a little excitement to the otherwise dull life of the main character, but other than that, I didn't find it remarkable.Check out The Lovely Bones if you want a great read!"
3,Boring--Not nearly up to par with his other books.,"I looked forward to reading this book, and I kept waiting for it to get better....it did at page 423 for the next 50 pages only.Perhaps Russo spoiled me with Sully in Nobody's Fool but the main character in this book, Miles, is everything that Sully isn't."
3,An okay novel,"This is a little cliched and predictable, but is an entertaining read. The characterisation is, however, very good."
2,Empire Falls,Only reading because a selection of my book club. Boring unpleasant characters . I am almost half through and nothing is happening that interests me. Cant wait to finish and get on to something worth reading.Shirley Halpern
4,Great Writing - but Where's the Plot?,"A remarkably well-written portrait of a group of people living in an economically depressed small town in Maine. This is the kind of fat, juicy, satisfying read you want when you are cooped up on a rainy weekend. You feel like you know the characters inside out and have walked a mile in their shoes. The problem? There doesn't seem to be much of a plot (and ""much of"" is being kind). Oh, everything finally comes to a head, after 400 pages or so - but it feels forced and artificial - I imagined an editor yelling at the author. The epilogue explains some things very neatly (too neatly for my taste), but fails to answer the ONE QUESTION that the protagonist had been wondering about since the beginning of the book. (I said some very bad words when I turned the page and there was no more.)"
2,The ending was a complete let down,"Although I found the characters amusing and well developed, the ending reminded me of a stereotypical, violent Hollywood film. It was such a let down that subtle insights about the characters' lives and about life in general were lost completely."
2,Boring,"The book was well written, but the storyline never picked up. I found the end did get a little better, but not worth reading the entire book to get to it.This book was painful to read, but I kept at it with the hope that it would get more interesting, but alas, it didn't."
4,It's the Characters,"I am shocked to read the negative reviews on this novel. This story is character-driven, while the great majority of today's novels seem plot driven or dependent on the shock of incest, poverty, domestic abuse. What's wonderful is that these are ordinary people in small town America (and not an unusual small town) yet the author is able to make them fascinating. I was disappointed when the novel ended because I wanted to continue observing their lives. This is for readers who are tired of the literary pretentiousness represented by some of today's ""in"" authors like Jonathan Franzen, for readers who are tired of writers who don't believe in punctuation (as in the Nobel Prize winner BLINDNESS)and writers who can't write dialogue above the bodice ripper level. EMPIRE FALLS is refreshing and fun to read."
3,Well-crafted in form but unpleasant in content,"In terms of form, this is a well-crafted novel with a vivid setting and colorful characters, so I can kind of see why it won the Pulitzer Prize. It's just too bad that, in terms of content, the setting and characters are uniformly unappealing. Thematically, it's about how one's fate is determined by one's nature, over which one has little or no control (it all comes down to ""nature"" and ""nurture"", i.e. genetics and environment). It also deals with issues of selfishness vs. selflessness, but Russo's shallow treatment (and I suppose a deeper consideration would be impossible for someone who does not believe that self-determination plays any significant role in forming moral character) makes both seem like paths to ruin. Still, worth reading once...but I won't be revisiting it."
3,"An enjoyable read, but suprised it won a Pulitzer","This book is enjoyable, well-written fiction. I definitely found the characters interesting, but the plot didn't come across as entirely believable at times, and was definitely a bit predictable at points. For me, this was more of a light read - not really something I would have expected to have won a Pulitzer prize for literature. That being said, I was definitely entertained by the book and felt that it was worth a read."
1,Are they stoned???,"Charging [so much] for a stupid acrobat file??? Did you ever try to read more than a few pages in this format? You'll end up printing the thing off, which will cost another small fortune in printer ink.I can't believe this price... They're too lazy to print a real book, and they expect us to pay as much as 2 real books cost for this so-called e-book? In a format that's hard to navigate, slow to respond on the screen, and hard as hell on the eyes!No way. You're not getting my money. I'd rather use my hard-earnd cash for toilet paper. At least I'd be getting some practical value."
5,A great scanning radio,Bought this for my fireman brother. I warned him it might be a pain to program from reviews listed here. The firmware allowed him to pick our county and away it went. He is very happy with the scanner.
4,Great Scanner,"The engineered design being versatile, whether desktop or installed into a vehicle dashboard, is a great feat!In my opinion, Uniden should have created their BCD996T control software using Cygwin/Gtk to compile all, Win32,Linux & Mac OSX binaries. Instead, Uniden only provides Win32 binaries of their software.(Not to fret, Linux/Mac users can run the BCD996T scanner software under Wine. Some but not all Windows bugs are eliminated using Wine.)I prefer versatille code, so the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 stars!Amazon next day shipping is great! ;-)"
1,Mazrui a fanatic writer,Mazrui has been blinded and brainwashed by his religion. Arabs invaded Africa as Europeans did. Islam is a foreign religion to Africa like christianity. He probably doesn't knows their prophet or where the religion developed. For him slave masters can be Europeans only they can not be Arabs or other people. It is surprising that he doesn't know that people from East Africa where he is from have been enslaved by Arabs and deported in the Middle East.Our continent needs scholars whose work are not based on emotions or fanatism.
4,An oldie but goodie,"This book has been around quite a while, but the technique it explains still works with almost any group seeking to figure out the resources that they have. I've participated in asset mapping groups, and it's worked very well. Now I have the step-by-step instructions to do it myself. Clear, easy to understand, classic."
4,The Power of Asset Mapping: How Your Congregation Can Act on Its Gifts,"This book describes the process to be used in a church to assist in helping the congregation identify its areas of passion in service. Asset mapping is a congregational alternative to having people identify their spiritual gifts, and applying those in areas of service."
2,not what I thought it would be,"I ordered this comforter set because I liked the colors and it was a great price, after receiving my order, I found out why it was so inexpensive. The colors look much brighter on my computer monitor than they do on the actual comforter. It doesn't look bad, just not what I expected. I've had it for about two weeks now and I haven't had any problems with it tearing or coming apart in anyway but I guess I'll have to wait and see."
1,Its not for the bed,"We brought it thinking it will go well with our other matching linens, but was turned out really horrible.This product uses totally bad fabric, and colors. Color started fading from day one, it was all over out clothes. My son is 8 months old and he was having this color all over his clothes and skin. We are afraid to use it again.We tried washing and it took the remaining color; now it looks like junk piece of cloth. Also after washing it started loosing its fabric. As usual it was all over it. So finally within one month we stopped using it completely. We use it as padding for packaging and storage now a days :)"
4,comforter review,I like the product we bought----I do believe the price they gave as a retail price was very high for what I recieved.
2,wish I hadn't bought it,"I bought this because of the price and the colors were what I was looking for. This comforter lasted less than 6 months before we had to replace it. It shredded at the seams and thread snagged all over every time my yorkies jumped up on the bed or if you lay down on it your buttons, jewelry, or any other little thing would catch and snag. It's okay if you make your bed and do not return to it until it's time to sleep."
1,Poor Quality,"I own 3 other Malibu Shores comforter sets and I just love it with no problem. But, with this particular set I'm so disappointed with the quality of the material is poor, the areas where two materials were sewn together is tearing apart, and the stitchings are coming apart in many different parts of the comforter. Not to mention the padding is already separating after two weeks of usage."
4,"beautiful, but thin","It was beautifu color, but thinner than I had expected it to be. still a nice decent thickness. Oiginal price marked is a gimmick like other similar bedding items, but worth 39.99"
3,"Good Design and Material.. But Color sticks to mattress,","I bought this Comforter set looking at the Photo and the price. It wasn't bad as I feared. while the Design/Outer color + feel were good, the inner layer/color + finishing were not pleasing. I was ok with that. Within 2 days of usage, we found the Pink color sticking to the mattress topper. Oops. I have returned the Comforter set to Amazon..!! Not sure with others experience on this..??"
1,They should be giving these away for FREE,"Thank God I only paid $10. If I'd paid anymore I would have felt like I'd been ripped off. Trust me, please do pass on this item. The material feels and looks cheap. The comforter runs small. Thank goodness I ordered a king for my queen size bed. The colors are muted and dull, not at all as vibrant as the photo. Purchase at your own risk. If it sounds to good to be true, it usually is. If Amazon had free return shipping I would return."
5,Some of the best lyrics I have heard on a CD in a while,"I'm into most of the Los Angeles underground latino rappers, and Mr. Criminal is the best I heard so far. Lil Rob, Shadow and Knightowl all have tight styles, beats and lyrics. But Criminal in my opinion brings it to a new level. Hooks on point, beats bump, and the lyrics twist you up. Mr. Capone, Criminal, and Snapper are leading the way just like Lil Rob and Shadow did in their day. Criminal is on the level of rappers like Enimen, Nas and Tupac, need I say more. I put his debut CD on top with Nas' first album, Snoop's Doggstyle, Fifty cent's first album Guess who back (yes Get rich or die trying wasn't his first)."
5,Love this album!,Luna Por el Rocio and No Lo Beses en la Boca knock me out. I keep looking for another album with songs so evocative. I've found some that come close.
3,review,enjoyable - good to see another side to kimora. I love that she is training her daughters to become moguls!
4,Very Good CD,"This is a good CD to get if you like national anthems. This CD was produced in 1992, so former countries like Czechoslovakia are still on it."
1,All anthems have very poor audio quality.,The poor audio quality of the recorded anthems makes this CD unusable for public events and personal listening. The highs are are not clean and the mids and lows are missing. Each anthem is performed so much like the next one that the unique flavors of each does not come through.
1,extremely disappointing,cd sound quality was not good at all. Nothing what I expected. For the price of it I should have guessed.
1,third Reich is Over!,"The German National Anthem once was sung with these words. But nowadays it's not.It's called ""Deutschland-Lied"""
2,'National Athems Of The World' (Madacy Records),"Cannot believe I'm even reviewing this CD,but I do like other patrons seeing what I have to say about music releases. This is by far very different than any other disc I've ever covered.What you get here are twenty-seven national anthems of countries like the UK, Western Germany, USA, Japan, Finland, Turkey,etc. This is not my cup of tea at all. Not even close. The only people I've ever known to enjoy this sort of music are Civil War buffs,history fanatics and citizens over 80 years old."
3,?!?!?! Czechoslovakia?!?!?!?!?!?! Where's that????,Have everyone in this country missed that Czechoslovakia isn't Czechoslovakia anymore (for some 10 years)?!?
3,wine opener,It works great getting most corks out without a struggle. It can't grab some of the newer synthetic corks that are set deeper into the bottle neck. Sometimes the cork gets stuck too far up in the device after it has been removed from the bottle and the plastic shield is too narrow to be able to grab the cork with my fingers (and my hands are tiny). I have to use pliers to grab the cork and get it out.
5,KHARMA ZU is RedHOT+RAD,Rahmani and his band added new flavor to the pop stew by combining the atmospheric complexity of modern American composers such as Dave Matthews and the Brand New Heavies. The sophisticated irony of their music reflects the best and worst of living in the 21st century they are helping to define. Diversity is this band's key to creating simply pleasurable music that has also managed to be mature and profound. Five stars and two thumbs up for Kharma Zhu.
1,Only 5 brackets,"Only 5 brackets? The link said ""Bag of 20"". What do I do with 5 brackets? I'm a regular Amazon customer and this is my first negative review. Very disappointing."
1,disappointing,"The first review I read regarding the shelf supports were that there were ""too many"". I thought this was great as I wasn't sure where and how many shelves I was going to use. I received 5 shelf supports. What the h@ll am I supposed to do with that. I get to put up one shelf. I paid 4.00 for the product plus 4.38 shipping and handling. Rubbish"
3,"First of the Dillard ""Dark"" Star Trek novels.","Star Trek Has it's happy novels, it's action novels, its romance novels, and its dark mind controlling novels.Demons is one of the first of this kind of novel. If you want to find the root for many of the more recent ""evil intelligence"" Star Trek novels, then seek this one out."
5,Excellent,"This is a dark...DARK novel. I recommend also picking up the authors other Trek novels. Very well written. The plot is good, the characters are engaging, and the crew is witin the established ""norm"" in their behavior. Nothing weird, just a good story."
2,Quite a disappointment.,"This is far from the worst Star Trek novel I've ever read, but truly it isn't very good. Those who've read other novels by J.M. Dillard are likely to be seriously disappointed in this effort. The characters are handled competently enough, and there's plenty of action for those who read Star Trek purely for thrills. But the basic plot is rather weak, and were it not for the blatant intercession of a very active author-deity, the good guys would have lost this one.I'm told that back in the days of the movie western serials, Hopalong Cassidy was once trapped in a box canyon, no way out, and hopelessly outnumbered by the approaching bad guys. Then the writers realized that they had written themselves into a corner, so when we ""tuned in next week"", the story began with ""After Hoppy got out of the box canyon..."" This story reminded me of that anecdote, notably in the segue from chapter six to chapter seven.Sloppy."
5,Excellent Debut Solo Album,"This is a great CD. Lots of complicated guitar arrangements that would knot up most people's fingers! Nice vocals also. If you are a fan of excellent guitar, then you NEED this.-JC"
5,Best Prostate Support!!,Great Protector of the prostate when on the Prohormones! Your prostate will get inflamed by them and this product makes sure your prostate is working normal!...IronHead
3,Didn't work so well,"I odered this for my husband, and he already has stopped taking it. It didn't help him much. Maybe he will try again later."
2,No Benefit,I used this product for several months beforemy urologist advised me that there is little if any benefit to using it.
3,Prostate aid,Do not really have a way to compare this product. It's helped a little bit when compared to before I started this product. Maybe in more time all will improve urine flow and the need to get up several times at night.
4,It works for me!,"I'm a 61-year-old man. I had been getting up 3x a night so my doctor gave me a prescription, but that sapped me of all energy and almost made me pass out. I tried saw palmetto with limited success. This is saw palmetto plus other ingredients and the combination works well. At most I get up once a night and many nights, I am able to sleep the whole night. Works for me!Update as of 2/23/2013. I've been on this a for several months now and most nights I am able to sleep through the night. Normal urine flow is much improved, not quite like a 16 year old, but far better than it was before I started taking this.As an aside,I accidentally ordered Now Prostate ""Health"" instead of ""Support."" It also works very well, but I discovered that it contains vitamin D3 and since I am already on a vitamin D3 supplement, I've gone back to ""Support."""
1,Does not do anything.,I tried this product after using Super Beta Prostate (worthless). This product is no better. After 30 days use it did absolutely nothing. I urinated 4 times during the night before and after talking this product. Don't waste your money if you are expecting it to lessen frequent urination due to an enlarged prostate.
1,It works but it leaves unsqeezed pulp behind.,"This review applies to any color Ojex household juicer. The March 14 review titled ""not for the weak or shaky"" found under the same juicer but in the color white is correct. I would add that among other bad features, the paint is being slowly ground off the hinge and this paint dust may get in your juice. This is the second juicer I have owned and I still own an electric made by Krups. The Ojex juicer leaves unsqueezed pulp behind that does not happen with the electric. Also, the peel is squeezed along with the pulp so your juice gets the bitter orange oil in it. This is not an issue with the electric. This juicer opens up just barely far enough to accept half an orange. I tried to get a half a grapefruit in there but it wasn't easy. All these bad features aside, I still use it and find it slightly more convenient than the electric. The product works but it is badly designed...just not badly enough to throw it out."
1,horrible product,"I purchased this at william and sonoma on clearance and it appeared to be a well constructed product but there are many flaws - first, you must use a short glass, second, it does not get all of the juice from the fruit, while the suction feet do not stay sticking to the counter so everything moves around and you have to use a lot of force to get just some just out. I got the same amount of juice from hand squeezing the left over pressed fruit as I got from the juicer with less effort. An additional problem is that the reamer does not rotate, so that is what is leaving all the pulp in the pressed fruit and not in the glass"
3,Bear's Big Sister,Bear loves the Crazy Ball. She has so much fun with it and is so much fun to watch. She has gone through the entire supply of mini chews needed to fill the ball. The manufacturer is no longer making the mini chews for the Crazy Ball. Substitutes are not a perfect fit. If anyone has a good substitute for the no longer available mini chews we would like to know what they are. karenmarini@verizon.net
3,the good and the bad,"I love this ball and my golden retriever loves it! The problem is getting refills. Anita recommended ""Grreat Choice"" at petco, but I just came from there and can't find it. You need a treat that is a good fit. If it's too big, it has to get rolled around until it crumbles enough to fall out or the dog gets bored and leaves. If it's too small, it all falls out in 1-2 rolls.So the search is on for a right size replacement."
5,Obra Maestra de la Literatura Argentina!!!,"Recien acabo de terminar la novela de Sabato por primera vez, sin palabras... a riesgo de pecar de ignorante me atrevo a decir que no hay una obra (o habra) en este mundo que le gane, a lo sumo puede empatarle."
4,Very interesting book,"Nicholas Dunbar does a very good job of telling the story of Long Term Captial Management and the people behind it. The book provides a general overview of the company and the events that eventually would lead to its demise. As someone on the inside of the situation I can say that the facts are fairly accurate, however not much specific deatil is provided. Very good read!"
3,Nothing new if you followed the story in the news,"I was disappointed that this book did not include more detail. I followed the story in the newspapers as it was happening, and this book gave me no additional insight. After reading ""Inventing Money"" I read ""When Genius Failed"" and enjoyed the latter more. ""When Genius Failed"" has more information on what happened during the crisis.One strongpoint of ""Inventing Money"" for some people will be the historical information. If you don't know much about hedge funds or the history of the industry this book will have good bits for you."
2,Nice Try....,"Mr. Dunbar does a decent job of detailing the history of modern finance. However, the book falls short of it's title detailing the story of LTCM. Perhaps Roger Lowenstein does a better job of telling the LTCM story."
2,Good Try -- But Falls Short of the Mark,"In his book, Nicholas Dunbar attempts the ambitious task of describing and explaining both the rise and fall of Long Term Capital Management and the underlying financial transactions that brought it down.While he succeeds relatively well in the former, he fails in the latter. I can guarantee that unless you are a Wall Street arbitrageur or have a very strong quantitative background in graduate level economics or finance, you will not understand half of what this guy is talking about. I know I didn't. (I may not be the smartest guy in the world, but I am a practicing attorney with an international law firm and have an MBA degree.) And without understanding the financial theory, a reader won't understand why LTCM failed, which is the whole point of the book.The sad fact is: Either Dunbar doesn't understand this stuff himself (which is what I suspect), or he just doesn't have the knack for making complex ideas simple for the reader.Nice try, though."
2,cannot finish reading this book,"This is one of the rare book in my recent reading history that I just can't seem to finish reading. I find the style of writing disjointed and I am not able to develop interest in the characters of the book either regardless of how famous they are. Perhaps if the author focus on fewer characters, it would help. (By the way, I really like The Smartest Guys in the Room--the Enron book)The book appears to be a hotchpotch of trade ideas. I suspect that the author is not very well versed in finance. I find the presentatinon of some standard finance theory awkward. I work in the field of credit derivatives for 6 years, so I don't believe my problem stem from my unfamiliarity to the topic."
2,Case falling apart,"I have the 120Gb version of this. The drive still works great and I've been happy with it, but am on the road all the time and noticed that 3 of the 4 screws that hold the case together have fallen out. I called support for replacement screws and said that wasn't covered by the warranty and I should go find some replacements myself. They said there was no way this could happen through normal usage and I must have 'damaged' it. Ironically their own web site describes it as ""Rugged and durable design."" I'd like to know if others have seen this as well."
2,Really hard going,"I read and very much enjoyed the books of Raymond Brown on John (RIP) - I found him to very humane and humorous at times. Fizymer (sorry, if you are still alive and reading this), as a writer, is, in my view, not in the same league. I also found some of his remarks in the footnotes a bit too smart. The introduction is excellent but I made 2 attempts over the space of 28 months to get through the rest of it and on each occasion I had to give up - I got to about the half way mark. I am sorry to be negative and perhaps the fault is mine -I am conscious that I am out of sync with the other reviewers. But, so be it."
1,Don't support knock-offs!,"This item is an unauthorized copy of the Magis ""Bombo"" stool. They can call it ""Bombo Style"" all they want, but it is still grounds for a lawsuit. Don't deprive designers of a living!"
5,Snotty rock from one of the real ones,"Johnny Thunders had what countless ""rockers"" desperately try to fake--genuine rock and roll soul. These songs are pumped full of that soul, especially his solo version of the staggering New York Dolls classic, ""Subway Train"". I love The Dolls' version but Johnny eclipses his old buddies on that one."
5,Johnny is on his game!!!,"My brief review will simply state if you like The Pistols, Thin Lizzy and a host of artists that can really rock......don't miss this. "".....It doesn't pay to try. all the smart boys know why....."""
3,fair quality,"I was a little dissapointed that this book is a library book. It has all the markings and stamps in it. Not acceptable condition.However, this book is perfect for a 3-5 year old who is moving to a new home and area. My little girl is 2 and it is a little over her head. very good book for helping with the transition."
2,Dried out,I ususally love these. But these were too dry to really enjoy. I'll just buy them in the store from now on.
3,soggy and not sugar-coated,"not covered in sugar like most of the other ones i've had. that might be good or bad in your opinion. i prefered them that way to mellow out the heat of ginger (these weren't very spicy, either). my main complaint with these was that they were almost ""moist"", which didn't provide the consistency i was looking for. i've since purchased a package from trader joe's that was essentially the same product, but for 1/3 of the price. i wouldn't buy these again."
3,Not very candy like,"I bought this to help my my pregnancy nausea. I think the taste of them make my nausea worse! I would not consider these candy, they are not very tasty. More like pieces of slightly sweetened ginger. Maybe I was expecting too much. Does tasty ginger exist?"
2,Much too strong for my taste,"I purchased this product to see if it would help with my morning sickness. It is way too strong for my taste. I liked the texture; it's like any other dried fruit. It was just too spicy for me, and I normally like spicy candy. Claey's Sandied Ginger, which I purchased at the same time, is more for me. Less strong, but still the ginger taste and smell."
3,It is what it is...,"It really tastes BAD, but maybe I shouldn't have expected some celestial taste from this ginger candy package. My wife is eating them because ginger is good for pregnancy..."
2,Spicy!,This is not for me at all. I got it because I was told ginger is great for heartburn. This set my mouth on fire. I'd prefer something sweet.
2,Not spicy at all,I bought this based on the reviews and the fact that I like The Ginger People chewy ginger. I bough 25 bags of this ginger and it's not spicy at all :( It's a bit sugary with a hint of ginger. Waste of money for me. Perhaps I got a bad batch...
2,Did Not Care for It,"I did not care for the taste. The crystallized ginger from SweetGormet.com was far better in flavor, color and texture."
3,Interesting historical record of one of the first scientific expeditions to the Maldives,"When this book was published in 1965 it must have been a ground breaking achievement. Very little was known then of the Maldives and underwater life in the atolls. Many photographs (of good quality given the technology of the time) complete an exhaustive description of the animal and plant life in the reef. The book is obviously obsolete in light of subsequent research and developments, but it remains an important historical record on the subject. Unfortunately the authors did not devote any space to life on the islands, though curiously they do write about Cylon (Sri Lanka) where they spent some time while their boat was undergoing maintenance."
4,"Nice mailbox, but not the same as what I ordered...","I like the quality of this mailbox, but the one I received is not the one listed under the item description. My mailbox has sort of a pebble-texture all over it, embossed in the metal, and is not ribbed anywhere. I really wanted a more old-fashioned look, and that is why I specifically chose the ribbed design described above as ""galvanized steel body is ribbed for extra structural strength"" - unfortunately that is not what I was sent.I do like that the flag is all metal, even the part that attaches the flag on the box - almost every other mailbox I have seen these days has this part made of plastic, and I have no idea how long they would last."
2,Find another,"I got this for my sister for christmas, because she is a fan and once she sprayed it she hated it. I wish I just kept my money."
2,what the........................,"Book was okay and the plot was a good one. What killed the book for me was the awful ""heroine"" Helen........WTH is her issue? Sure he closed himself off to you in the past and his return is a shock but seriously the man was tortured for a year and couldn't remember things about his life and you can't put aside your anger at him while he heals? Really? Especially since he DOESN'T remember being distant and cold. I can't get over how awful she was and how much better Gabe deserved than her."
5,Fabulous book,"I had first ordered another of Marliss Melton's books. When it came it went directly onto the bottom of my reading stack. I've never liked ""war"" stories and was under the impression that was what the book was about. Finally I got to the end of the stack and started reading. I couldn't put the book down. I then ordered all of Melton's other books. Melton is my new favorite author. This book is quick moving from the first page, spellbinding, with just enough romance. I want more Marliss Melton!"
5,It was GREAT!!,I almost didn't buy this based on some of the reviews...but I took a chance and am glad I did. This ones a keeper and I've ordered the rest of the series.
1,"If you prefer an intelligent, likable heroin - don't bother with this one!","I like Melton, but she sure went wrong with her main character. Gabe is a likable hero, who is just back from being held prisoner and tortured for a year. Helen is his wife, who behaves like a self-centered, self-serving teenager. From the first moment she sees him in the hospital, she miss-treats him because her feelings are hurt that he was more of a soldier than a husband before he was taken prisoner. I finally gave up on the book when Helen's shallowness led to her stupidly endangered Gabe's life. This is only the third book I've ever given up on. Don't bother with this one!"
5,Excellent Performace,"This album is a real find! The performer has almost everything needed to express this virtuosic yet impressionistic work; A brilliant technique, tonal clarity, sense of structure, and nuance. There is no unnecessary use of rubato.Along with Ms. Luiza Borac and Jenny Lin, another promising young pianists, Ms. Budiardjo is the one we have to be concerned."
2,can't say dis one gelled wit me right away...sounds like a low rent Graceland,"Yep, I applaud the genius of the legendary Van Dyke Parks...but...i gave this album my ""mp3 playa test"" and it sounded like a low budget version of Paul Simon's Graceland, done with cheap keyboards and a steel drum. So I skimmed through it and pretty much had to skip over most of it. Just didn't grab me like Discover America or even Orange Crate Art, his '95 collaboration with Brian Wilson. Buy those first."
3,Harken to the clang of the Yankee Reaper.,"This was Van Dyke Parks' third album. The music is played in a calypso style. Oddly enough, even though Parks is more known as a composer than a performer, he only co-wrote one of the songs here. But the album is still pleasant enough, even if it is a bit on the short side, with a 30 minute running time."
5,Another essential album from Van Dyke Parks,"Only one song from this album was written by Van Dyke Parks: ""The Clang of the Yankee Reaper"" (which is not coincidentally the highlight of the album). However, because of his unique arrangements, and distinct voice (this is his last album when it still sounds its finest), his name is all over the other songs of this album; at times it calls to mind ""Discover America"", with the steel band on several songs, other times, like on the title track, it is a bit closer to ""Song Cycle"", but has a distinct sound from both of them, though still clearly by the same artist. Though I would recommend that you buy ""Song Cycle"" or ""Discover America"" before this album, this is not inferior to either."
3,Big Buck$ For What?,"How much trouble would it be for someone to write a short blurb about the contents of this version of Clang? For the uninformed, it has 2 bonus tracks (both of Amazing Grace) which time in at less than 3 minutes total. That's a pretty hefty premium for 2 tracks, wouldn't you say? There will be those AIG employees and the like that won't mind shelling out $[...] bucks from their bonus checks but probably not too many of the rest of us. Memo to Mr. Bezos...if you want to move this high priced inventory, hire someone to promote the sale by writing a brief description and a track listing. There are people in this country that could use the work. DUH!!!"
3,Very serene and relaxing.,"I have had this disc from Zamfir for quite some time. It's very enjoyable and serene to listen to. His pan flute playing is very good. The pan flute is a beautiful-sounding instrument that I never tire of hearing. The twelve songs that are on this disc are romantic in nature. They are renditions from different films. The London Pops Orchestra also plays along with Zamfir (it's a good combination). I like listening to this album because it's so peaceful and relaxing (it puts me at ease). A lot of the material is very moving to hear. My favorite songs are ""Cavatina"" and ""For Your Eyes Only."" Zamfir and the London Pops Orchestra really complement each other nicely. This is a better-than-good collection of romantic songs. I actually give this 3.5 stars. Give it a listen."
1,TERRIFYING!,"Vi spose one en carnate voods medievil xs. 0, 0 romants here. Very bhad! Flute dude b ^ nasal. Sihck!"
1,not good,"I can only give this product a single star. When I installed it, my computer crashed. I've installed many Gigs of RAM before so I know the fault wasn't mine. After I got my computer back to running order, I reinstalled the RAM. The computer threatened to crash again."
3,Vaguely entertaining,"The problem with this series is that it's filled with inconsistencies and the ending leaves much to be desired. It manages to keep you hooked by revealing juicy bits of the plot and the pasts of characters, but in the end, nothing is explained. And I mean NOTHING. Regardless of this, the overall series is still somewhat enjoyable, which is why I'm giving it a three. Certain episodes are great. Sadly, this fact makes it that much more aggravating when the story falls short. I'd say borrow it from a friend rather than buy it yourself. The best way to describe this series is wasted potential."
3,Not the Greatest,"I bought this series on a whim and although I am not regreting the purchase, it is almost collecting dust on my bookshelf. The first 6 or so episodes were great. The plot seemed to be thickening, you knew that Kai would sometime realize that he is in an evil organization, etc. However, the episodes always left cliff hangers that you would anxiously skip through the opening captions to get to the next episode only to be greatly disappointed. Not only was the ending of the series rushed, it wasn't understandable."
4,Cool anime,This is an enjoyable anime. Good players in it. Good action scences and the art is done well. Only problem is that it did not havea good ending. Nothing was settled. The battle still continues. Still a good anime to watch
1,A Gangster's Girl,It was definitely not what I thought it was going to be. It was so boring and so slow. What was the point of this book? All they basically did was fly all over the place and have sex. The only good part was the end. Just because it ended thereA Gangster's Girl
4,Bad Ending,"The book was overall good, although the author did seem to jump from one scene or character to the next. The ending just did'nt do it for me."
4,It was good,"Gangsters Girl was a good book no doubt, but toward the end she could have made some better decisions. I feel that she wasted time and put her life at hands toward the end, and that made me mad cause Ceazia was hot all through the book. If you have not read this then do so, if you like urban books than you will most def love this book."
4,"Drama, Drama & More Drama","I read this books in a couple of days..it's an interesting read..the reader had some original ideas and then she had some that were used before, but overall I found the novel entertaining.. I liked the sweet way Ceasia got revenge at the end...; also Ceasia (the main character) is tied to the game for a ride that's bound to determine her future... I do look forward to the conclusion in Chunichi's next novel ""Married To The Game""."
3,"Respectable Read, but WHEW Slow Down","I won't go into any spoilish details with 'A Gangster's Girl' however I wished this book had more build up. Seemed like every scenario and situation was so fast paced that there wasn't much depth at all in the story. I'm not saying fast pacing is necessarily a bad thing, but at the time, even some great street-lit reads like 'B-More Careful: Meow Meow Productions Presents' and 'Money Power Respect' had its share of fast-pacing but had meatier writing and storytelling when it came down to the overall finished product those books that made them fire! I can only assume the writer was trying to write this book not as a novel but as a novella, maybe...? Nevertheless, the book isn't bad, it's just on average in my opinion and acted as a warm act to the next read. So to me if you looking for a book that will get you ready for the next one or something quick to read during spring break or summer vacation, I do suggest it for that.Rating - 3/5.0"
2,Borrow it DO NOT BUY IT,"Very poorly written. typos and bad grammer. The book was rushed and had poor charcter development, had an ok story line but nothing you haven't seen before. Could have been way better if it had more details and actually flowed."
3,"""whats a girl to do""",THE BOOK WAS OKAY I REALLY THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER JUST WHEN THE STORY WAS STARTING TO GET GOOD IT WAS OVER I DONT LIKE THE END WHAT COULD PART TO BE ABOUT? I'M CONFUSED SHE GOT RID OF HER MAN SO WHAT NOW DONT TELL ME SHE WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER GANGSTER THIS BOOK WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE I MEAN COME ON IT WASNT THAT SERIOUS YOU FIGHT TO GET OUT OF JAIL THEN GOING TO HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND GO RIGHT BACK WHATEVER I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON CHUNICHI I WILL READ ANOTHER ONE OF HER BOOKS.
3,Can I get a lil' mo info please?,"This was a good book with a great plot. Ceazia is a major thug lover. She loves her man, she's down for whatever, and she ain't even messed up about doing the time with him. But, being that ""all men are dogs"" when circumstances prevents her from feeding Vegas what a man thinks he has to have all the time, here comes trouble. It's a thin line between love and hate, and we all know that a bullet don't have a name on it. 'A Gangster's Girl' captures your attention with the content, but it needs a little more work as far as development of the characters and their stories. It's a pretty good read, and I'm sure she'll do better with the next one."
2,????????????????????,"While I did read this bood to the end and was slightly entertained, overall I did not think it a good read. First and foremost, the editing was off. I still never really understood the lie surrounding Vegas' age. It was just wayyyyyy too much packed into this little book and nothing was fully developed. Lastly, I truly didn't like the way the book ended, but I was intrigued by the excerpt from his/her next book!"
3,Okay book,"The book was real good. But you can tell its a book. I say this meaning there were too many unbelievable circumstances. The author watched too much tv. But i cant hate it was a good read, i read it in 2 weeks.It usually take sme a couple of days."
2,Damn,"I like the whole idea of the book it wasn't utilize the way I thought it should be. The ending was to vague and it wasn't much Emphasis on the detail, overall i thought it could've been better butit was a ok book. On the positive sides of things I at least finished it in 7 hours, I just hope her new book Married To The Game is 10x better."
3,Was hoping for more,"I was questioning the point of this story throughout the whole entire reading. I wish Chunichi would of use more detail and and elaborated more on some of the events popping off in the story. I still love her work, especially her story ""Anyeh"" from GIRLS FROM DA HOOD. All together it was a fun and enjoyable read."
3,What happens in Virginia Beach should stay in Virginia Beach,"Ceazia, a Virginia Beach, fake diva, turns to tricking when she's discovered that trying to live a certain lifestyle is costly! A GANGSTER'S GIRL is a tale told by the author about her and her fake elite hoe clique as they drink, fight, and experience the coldness of betrayal from the men they want to love and in certain cases one another. A GANGSTER'S GIRL was just an okay read. Nothing so hot I couldn't stop turning the pages.And for the record, Chunichi, honey it took your Gangster too freaking long for me to show up, but I bet you caught Vegas' heart in the end!"
3,Quick Read,this was an entertaining book. a quick read that has plenty of drama. the book only took me a day and a half to read. i can't wait to read the sequel!
3,Too Many Unbelievable Twists and Turns,"Too much Gucci and designer talk and too many scenes that just didn't make sense. Now with that said, I would still recommend this book because it's if nothing else entertaining, which I thougt was great. The ending will literally blow you away. I didn't expect that at all. Last I will say I'm more likely to buy an Urban book than a Tripple Crown book, but both companies need to find better editors. Don't hate me these are just my thoughts."
4,And then what........,"Ok now dont get me wrong, this was a good book, very fast-paced and held my attention! But what I didnt like was how certain parts or scenarios wasnt elaborated on long enough.When somethimg happened that was just it, it just happened. No ifs, ands or buts about it,people who have previously read this book know what I am talking about.This book basically left you hanging all throughout it and especially at the end.But since I know there are other parts to this book I wasnt THAT disappointed.Good read but could have been better.But I will read the other books following this one!"
4,good read,this book was a lil different from most books Ceasia was a good girl until Vegas did her wrong when he was in jail. i did not like the way the book ended but it was still a good read.
3,IT WAS ALRIGHT,"It is another story of how we are willing to do for a man just to be with them, only to get your heart broken. It could had gotten a little deeper."
3,New cover,"I have the old version of this book. I guess TCP decided to take the author off the cover of her own book huh? Damn.Anyway this book was alright in the urban fiction department. But there's a new broad on the block, Stacy Nelson, and her book Don't Knock The Hustle to me is as realistic in its situations that it can get. These writers need to get together and put out a 1000 page book."
4,Ceazia,"This book was a good start to Chunichi's saga. I thought the plot was pretty interesting and it had quite a few ""twists & turns"" that I didnt expect and found entertaining.The novel ""A Gangster's Girl"" written by author Chunichi was based upon the character Ceazia. Ceazia, as usual females in these urban novels used her good looks to get what she wanted and had a need for nothing besides a good man.She soon meets big time drug dealer Vegas who equally uses the good looks he was blessed with to get the women he so desire.Vegas and Ceazia get off to a wonderful escapade that any girl would be jealous of. Vegas falls head over heals with Ceazia and she does the exact with Vegas. However not all fairytales last forever.Chunichi does a great job twisting this book unto what I would have ever expected. If I tell too much, I'll ruin the book. This is a good fast paced read that most interested in urban books should take a look at."
5,Another Gem from J. Allen Boone!,"If you loved Kinship with All Life, then do not hesitate to read this book, in which J. Allen Boone further explores telepathic relationships with beings of all kinds. My favorite chapters recount his experience with a large group of wild monkeys in a distant jungle. Through communication via what Boone calls the ""silent language"" of the heart, he and the monkeys reached such a level of mutual trust that, undisturbed by his presence, they began swinging from tree to tree with awe-inspiring speed and agility in a master performance of grace and athleticism. Throughout the book, Boone's descriptions and beautifully expressed insights into the nature of the universe are a joy to read.Peggy Korneggerauthor of Living with Spirit, Journey of a Flower Child"
2,A bit simplistic,"And perhaps written for kids? This book is not well suited for an experienced adult. I found it repetitive and boring but there are scores of others who disagree. Feel free to check it out, but it won't satisfy everyone."
5,Excellent tips,"I bought this DVD hoping it would have a couple of tips to help my 3.0-3.5 game. Although I work with a good pro at the club where I play, I found Jensen to be very entertaining and helpful. His advice is excellent for my game, his video illustrates the tips well. He is concise and to the point and the video is loaded with good info."
2,Track plans only,"There is nothing in this book except the track plans and in some plans it is difficult to find out the square feet required. Nothing on building the layout. For $9 you might be able to use one plan. It's not really a book, it's a phamplet."
1,Poor Booklet,"I followed a link from garden railroading to this book. Even though the plans could be used for any gauge train with a little work, the plans are not put together very well. This book is primarily for 'O' and 'S' gauge track. (It says that at the bottom of the cover in the small colored band, you just cannot see it in the pictures from this site!) Each plan has a list of the track needed for assembly, BUT, it does not tell you where each of the track pieces fit. Most plans call for custom cut pieces with no info as to where they fit. The booklet is 48 pages."
5,Dont Sleep on this ARTIST,This album is one of the BEST independent CD I have heard in a while. North Carolina is making their way into the Industry. Everybody should have this Album
4,hmmm... not bad,"This kinda reminds me of late 70s/early 80s Residents, which isn't a band i would have expected to compare either early- or latter-era Boredoms. Personally i find it more rewarding than the supposedly ""serious"" editions in the series that were released later (Super Roots 5, anyone?). As long as you don't pay thru the nose for it, and you have some idea what to expect from early 90s B.O.R.E., grab it and get ready for sixteen minutes of fun."
4,wacked out bliss & not too much,"the 1st 3 tracks here all go for a minute or less, not unlike the music made by this reviewer, surf rock, screaming & other styles all gloriously mashed up. The last track is about 134 tracks, seeming made up of many tracks w/in a track, including the bit where the title is chanted ""soooop-ah roooz"". Joy."
1,"Dubious... Caveat Emptor, Sox fans.","The statistical side is nothing special, with info you could get from The Baseball Encyclopedia or a host of great (and thorough) websites. The most glaring red flag was its description of the '78 playoff game, in which the author claims Bucky Dent hit his homer tying the game at 3-3. Anyone with a modicum of baseball knowledge knows the Sox had a 2-0 lead at that point and Dent's homer put the Yanks ahead. If Mr. Gentile can't be bothered to research that correctly, then what else has he gotten wrong? Nope, avoid this and go read David Halberstam, Thomas Boswell or Roger Angell. In fact, read all of them and feed your soul."
1,I had no idea I was dealing with thirld world conceptions of time,"I am a new Amazon customer.Here is my history purchasing textbooks with Amazon---book 1 - normal shippingbook 2 - express shipping (at extra cost)book 2 arrived just a day before book 1, almost a week after shipping.I logically concludd that, for Amazon, shipping dates are unreliable and fluid.Therefore, for book 3, I opted for the ""free"" shipping, understanding it may takea day or two longer. Apparently, I was quite foolsih. Though I purchased it fourdays ago, it hasn't even shipped yet. Only God knows when it wil arrive.Am I supposed to believe that's acceptable?Does it really take a week just to get the thing in the mail?Amazon is looking pretty sad to me right now. Considering the priceof the textbook I bought is only inimally better than the one at my schoolbookstore, why should I deal with Amazon?I think the answer is, I will not deal with Amazon"

4,"""So, how can Judaism make me a better person?""","If you've asked that question, peruse this book and discover for yourself whether the morals and ethics of Judaism appeal to you. If they do, you will find this book's brief but thorough looks at most subjects of ethical and moral interest in our lives to be quite enriching."
4,great water bottle for preserving the refreshingly clean taste of water,"due to my concern of my nalgene bottle's plastic seeping, i decided to go with a simple stainless steel bottle. the water tastes great, even seems to be cooler. no funky changes in the flavor if it's been sitting in the bottle for a while. i got the loop cap, and the cap can use a design improvement that i can explain but would take too much space.i've already dented my bottle within weeks, but it's definitely not broken. i like that it's just metal, no plastic and no lining like sigg bottles. highly recommended."
5,"Solid, doesn't leak","Doesn't seem like it'd dent easily, hasn't yet, and don't foresee it. I have two caps, the plastic one and the stainless steel one. Both close tight and I don't have to worry about any leakage. I switch out my water once a day, and I haven't noticed any metallic taste.Does what I want it to and it looks like it's going to last a long time. Webvitamins also has great customer service, based on something that happened during my order. I am entirely satisfied."
3,"Good, but not perfect","I got this 100% stainless steel water to replace my poisonous Nalgene bottles. It's a good design, but I only give it 3 stars for two reasons.1. Opening it gives an unpleasant ""fingernails on the chalkboard"" feeling.2. There's no attachment for the cap (I even checked the manufacturer's website, and tried to use one from SIGG, but it didn't fit.I also got a water bottle from Guyot Designs, and I think that one is perfect. It's got an excellent cap design, and more spout options. Hopefully Amazon will carry them soon as well; I had to order them directly from Guyot's website."
5,Funny and Touching Novel,"Justified Means is the story of a woman dealing with a disabled child. It's also the story of a pastor's wife who steals. Those contradictories make for a very enjoyable read. Her honesty about being angry at God is refreshing, especially for those who are more used to black-and-white characterizations of churchgoers."
5,read this one,"Parini is a fabulous biographer with a balanced story to tell. found it hard to put this down. Frost is a complicated person, but Parini does him justice here."
3,Got what I ordered,"I was surprised how fast I received my original order. Unfortunitely when I unpacked it I found it to be broken. I followed the return policy, very easy and the second came almost as fast. They stood behind their product 100%. They answered my emails and kept me informed as to how the process was to work. I would buy from them again without hesitation."
1,this is NOT supercharger,"OK, for all of you who think think Supercharger put out another album...think again. I just listened to the samples and this is some bad funk/dance/weird band who took the name Supercharger."
5,This guy delivers!,"I saw Ray at the recent Wings and Strings Americana festival in Polk City, Florida. At this event they have a solo stage next to the main stage, which is used as the main stage is getting set up for the next group, which in this case upcoming was Fred Eaglesmith. Usually the solo stage is ignored or people use this time to hit the head or get a beer. When Ray came on, nobody knew him from Adam, but after two songs (from Rough Luck) there was a small crowd in front of the solo stage to get a better look at this guy sounding like a small band all by himself. This guy has the ability to write and perform simple songs with catchy lyrics, which this cd is full of. By the end of his performance, he had the crowd up on their feet! I have both the cds, and would highly recommend both, but especially Rough Luck."
2,"Lots of cheese, but there are a few highlights","Most of the songs here use a sort of easy-listening production style you might hear on an Andy Williams album from the 60s. However, there are a few tracks that have a more stipped-down, bonafide folk feel to them: Black Velvet Band, Whisky in the Jar, Goodbye Mick, and Rosin the Bow. Star of County Down, Dear Old Donegal, and Rose of Trallee are also fairly inoffensive. Overall, this is probably not a bad purchase if you can find it for under $5."
3,Sleeve kit,Time consuming to install and the clamp covers did not work on this Ford. Probably better suited for GM's.
3,starting point,"I ordered this book as a canadian looking to get information on getting through the red tape to visa's, USMLE's etc. This book is more designed for the noncanadian MD and some of the information seems not to be up to date or entirely clear. The most useful thing i got from this was the addresses of the individuals i could contact to ask questions for myself."
5,A Unique Guide to the Underwater World,"An avid scuba diver and underwater photographer myself, I own and enjoy many ""coffee-table-style"" underwater books, as well as a fair collection of field guides to coral reefs and marine life. What I appreciate most about the Tackett's new book is the way it has combined beautiful underwater photography with valuable commentary, annotations, and even arrows defining particular points of interest. ""Reef Life"" represents a wonderful melding of the science and the esthetics of the marine environment. Equally appealing to adults and children, it has provided me with additional knowledge and appreciation. I now look forward to sharing this appealing new book with my young nephews."
5,A must for the UW Photographer,"I have been waiting for this book! Burt Jones got me focused on the 'one metre' dive a few years back and I've been enjoying macro critters and muck diving ever since. In this awsome new book, the Tacketts bring you their personal experiences with the macro world and incorportate a great deal of useful information which can help all of us better understand the interrelationships amongst all the critters. That understanding is one of the keys to making better images of the critters.If you are a diver and you really want to get acquainted with the underwater world, stop swimming and start looking. And this book gives you step by step pointers on how to go about looking and helps you understand what you are seeing."
5,Wonderful!,"What a delightful and informative book! As I've been able to do more diving and snorkling in SE Asia the past couple of years, identifying the underwater life has become a hobby as much as my love of birding. But I wanted to know more than just identification. This book is very readable and informative, suitable for adults and older children. The photographs are gorgeous and very clear. I'm reading it cover to cover. Many thanks to the Tacketts!"
5,"good mat, reasonable cost","I wanted to replace the old aeromat I'd been using for over 10 years, but was discouraged at the variety available. Finally saw this one, seemingly exactly the same as the old mat, exactly what I wanted - 72"" long, 1/4"" thick, choice of colors, and not exorbitant price. I hoped it was the same mat since I knew the quality was good and it would hold up to nearly daily use over many years.The new mat is sticky but not too sticky, just right padding, extra length. Did have an odor for the first use, but I left it unrolled for a couple of days and the smell dissipated.YeS! Very pleased."
5,Best Sontag resource available,Any and all of Sontag's works and the volumes of articles and books written about her are listed here. Indexed! Intelligently done! Bravo!
4,For the novice,"The book is well presented and well done graphically, but suffers by trying to be too much at once. It would have been better had the author settled on one topic. The title may be a little misleading, if its an Atlas you want, then spend another $80.00 and get the Miitary History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars re:published by Stackpole, written by Elting et al at the US Military academy. For a surface glance and for a novice it will suffice."
5,Comfort in the Darkness,"An addicting album that in my opinion only has 1 flaw... It's too short!Sub Conscious is a journey through ambient trance and it does a damn good job if I say so myself. Phutureprimitive did an excellant job of using tribal drums and instruments and mixing them with modern day dance beats. Also you'll notice the vocals are from his female ""sidekick"" which also brings life to the album (usually these types of CDs end up using sampled vocals).A must have for serious ambient trance fans."
3,"great service, quick and easy","If you like Electronica, this is a cd you should give a listen to, etherial, ambient, and spatial...Great for incidental or high focus.In a word 'cool'."
3,"Very good, very weird! Just the way I like it!!","Although I prefer varied artist on my cd's, this is on to pop in on a long ride."
3,Dwarfed by 'Are You Shpongled'.,"I was initially very excited by this album, but the more I listen to this CD the more it feels derivative and formulaic. The great 'Are You Shpongled?' by Shpongle is blatantly imitated here. Still a good listen, but don't settle."
5,"Not shpongle, but excellent still","Another reviewer rated this album low by comparison to Shpongle's 'Are you Shpongled?' - True, this isn't Shpongle, but it is still top-notch chill downtempo with a tribal twist. It is more organic than many other similar artists and deserves a few more stars for re-playability alone."
5,9v rechargeable battery,This battery is working great in my metal detector after charging it to 1oo% before every use.Use only if you can quickly remove it for charging between uses.Remember that these do not last as long as non rechargeable batteries.
2,Not what I expected,"These rechargeable batteries say they are rechargeable 100's of times, but in reality, they don't hold charge fully after less than 50 charges. I would do some research and buy a better quality rechargeable 9 volt battery."
3,Unexpected performance,"I ordered 4 of the Eveready NH22NBP 9V Rechargeable Batteries and just received them this afternoon - a day early - a plus for Amazon Prime and USPS. The batteries were immediately plugged into my 9V charger, but one felt loose, and it was. The positive terminal connector was connected but the battery was not - the little ""button"" on the battery was still in the charger. At this point, I have 3 batteries that have been charged, but not yet in service with all their connectors so I can report that they all took a charge. My rating is based on poor quality by Eveready and the inconvenience of getting a replacement. This is not Amazon's fault nor USPS. but it is a pain you know where. At a later date I will write a review on at least the 3 that have not lost their buttons - yet."
1,Wrong Size,The battery was too thick. The is the only rechargeable battery that would not fit because it is the same size as a standard 9v battery.
5,"Great, lively, compassionate essays","""The essays in Orphans all turn on the axis of doubt, ambivalence, uncertainty and hesitancy. D'Ambrosio believes these qualities are essential to human nature, and finds himself in essay after essay crossing swords with the knights of absolutism, whether they bear the standard of fundamentalist Christianity, radical environmentalism or the Channel 24 Action News. . . . D'Ambrosio is a major talent. He blends the absurdist sensibility of Donald Barthelme with John Updike's plush prose and Philip Roth's dyspeptic humor to create a voice wholly his own. Whether his muse will some day deliver a great novel is an open question, but for now we have Orphans, and Orphans is plenty."""
1,"Dull writing, journalistic style","I was very disappointed by this dull, drawn out, and boring collection of essays. The most interesting writing was at the end of the book when the narrartor revealed a poem his father had written along with personal letters among brothers. Otherwise, I had to force myself to get through this rambling, male Eurocentric, dull, journalistic style collection of stories. This narrator uses tired cliches, follows a sexist and racist ideology, fails to look at the larger historical, societal, and economic factors that lead to contemporary issues of prostitution in Russia, and tries to take credit for ""thinking up"" the reclaiming of language that ethnic and women's studies scholars have been asserting for decades. I really did not like this book. It is pretentious and it is not even reader friendly (small to hold, small print, etc.). Try Jo Ann Beard's, The Boys of My Youth. Now there's a collection of short stories and essays!"
3,Fascinating Look Back in Time,"The book's titular hero works his way quickly up the ladder to appear on a live pet-related television show, and we see one perspective on television in the mid-1950s: a magical wonderland of spontaneity. You will find no critiques of kids watching too much TV or the realities of television production. But you will find a glimpse into 1950s cultural optimism and naivete regarding the impact of television on our culture from a white, middle-class perspective. It will baffle children of today, but read with an adult might prove an interesting lesson on how very much attitudes toward TV have shifted over time."
4,Cute purse!,"I got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She loves it. Here is some info about it you can't see in the online picture...~There are no interior pockets~Has a beautiful pink satin lining~Closes with a velvet loop around a well affixed fuzzy ball like button. This is ok, but if you have a daughter who likes to swing her purse around, the contents could easily fall out.~It feels well made, not like something that's going to fall apart in 10 minutes.~Pink shoulder strap has the same velvet feel at the loop closureHope this is of some help to everyone!"
2,Not practical,"This book has some wonderful time consuming gourment recipes that you're sure to use once every few years on special occasions. My southern hunter husband turned his nose up at most of the recipes in this book. It's ok for entertaining and special occasions, but not what I was looking for."
2,Looks great but leaks,"Now, I'm not positive I have this coffeemaker. It looks the same. Mine is recalled but I haven't sent it back yet. I can't find another cobalt blue coffeemaker to replace it. Mine might be a 12 cup not 10. However, the leaking issues mentioned already by others are correct. The coffee doesn't stop dripping when you try to sneak a cup and for some unknown reason sometimes it over flows grounds and water all over the counter. Also the caraffe spills when pouring so there is water spilt every time we make coffee and coffee spilt when pouring into the cup. I am very frustrated with the whole situation. Paid a hundred bucks for a leaking pot that looks great on the counter with my other Kitchenaid appliances. Red, white and black don't go in my kitchen at all."
3,ChangingTimes,"This CD has a different feel than the usual Marvin Sapp CD due to the various producers on call. The album has good material but does not seem to find its seam in the fabric of musical tone. Nevertheless, there are some gems, such as 'Be Exalted, and Do you know Him.'"
3,"looked great, but didn't fit my cd player","Adaptor arrived as described but did not fit my Philips cd player. Vender was great, mailed it back and recieved full refund, dissapointed that it didn't work out..."
4,Timeless Tales 4 Star Review,"by Kir DevonScott lost everything in the 9/11 attacks. His family has been dead for five years now, and he works diving in lakes. He quit his job after he lost his family.He takes an assignment at Table Rock, which is a military base, and meets Aleecia. Aleecia is special and has powers far beyond any normal human being. These special powers save him when he gets in trouble on a dive.Their attraction leads to them being the target of troubles and danger. As they grow closer, they start to take on some top secret assignments and fall in love. Can they keep their attraction and work apart?This book tried to do too much. It was a fine paranormal romantica, but took off in a new direction when a government thriller started. This would have been much better served as its own plot."
2,WARNING Bad acting a plenty!!,"o.k. this is a low budget, bad acting by even worst actors movie, what more can be said, well it could be a really fun movie, if your all real drunk and nothing else is on the t.v. I mean the cover is good so I give that one star and it did eventually end and for that I give it another star."
1,Beware!! Do not buy this,Purchased 2 of these to store my UMD's. The plastic pockets fit the UMD movies and games so tight that its next to impossible to remove them. It almost forms a suction around the UMD. I am getting rid of both of mine. One of my games has already been damaged from storing it in this case.
2,Not All That Great,I bought this because I have more than 8 UMD's that fit in that standard one that hold's just 8. The games are hard to get out! When you put them in....it is like suctioned in! and you have to struggle to pull UMD out. One little pocket even tore a bit. I know they can make something better than this. I am still waiting!!!!
1,poorly designed,NOT A WELL DESIGNED PRODUCT.Latch on case does not work well.After using this case my games now have scratches on them. Don't waste your money. Cloth made cases are much better.
3,Decent,"Decent item, latch doesnt stay very tight. Plastic slots kinda stick to UMD cases, bcuz the little side lip catches & it can be a biotch to get the UMD out."
2,Convenient,"This product works, when it's not full. I have many PSP movies and games, and asked my husband to buy this for me to take on a trip. When it was fun, it would not close. As long as the last couple of slots were not full, it was working."
1,case is garbage,this case is garbage i couldn't close the case all the way without worrying about breaking the games. Need to make the case big enough to accomodate the umd games
1,Does not hold 16 UMD disks.,bought two of them hoping to get all our PSP games and movies in. Well it comes with 4 plastic sleeves that each holds 4 games per sleeve. Problem is if you use all the sleeves and put PSP Games/movies in them. then the case WILL NOT close. So still looking for a great case for them.
2,didn't fit,"Make sure you double check the size and model before you order. Twice I've clicked on links with my model number and have gotten beaters that don't fit and had to pay shipping each way on both. Once was an incorrect listing from the seller and the other was an incorrect link I guess that was listed under the ""new and used"" section. I recommend contacting the sellers first."
1,Wrong beaters!!!!!,"The description said these beaters would fit my Sunbeam 2360 stand mixer. They aren't anywhere close to fitting!! If I decide to return these, I will pay for shipping and get a refund of $3-4. Hardly worth it! Now I am out $13 and have the wrong beaters."
2,oops,"The beaters I bought because they looked perfect and I was so happy they were still available.Unfortunately, they are not the correct ones. They don't fit into my mixmaster. Damn."
1,"Right model number, size did not fit","I bought these beaters to replace the original ones---we double checked the model as suggested by a previous review. When the order arrived, the beaters were too big and did not fit at all. I don't know how a model # can be listed and it does not fit!"
1,Did not fit,"Purchased these because the description stated these would work for the brand/model I own. However, these beaters are made differently than the ones I have and they do not fit. Not worth the effort to return but will not be purchasing from this site again."
4,OK - doesn't fit the blenders it says it does.,"I bought this item for a blender that was listed for them to fit. They didn't fit. They are about 1 inch too long for my Heritage blender. So, if you know for sure these will fit they are nice quality but you need to make sure the models listed actually work first."
1,Didn't work for me,These beaters said they would fit my mixer but one fit and the other didn't. When I called they said there was nothing they could do but send a refund. Now back to square one to find a replacement or buy a new mixer.
5,Beater Replacement,Bought to replace beaters that were mangled by a spoon! Works great; good price. Will definitely reorder the next time the beaters meet up with another spoon and come out on the wrong end of the deal!
5,Work Great!,"I was given the original Sunbeam Mixer my grandmother used for so many years after she passed away. I have wonderful memories of her whipping up some awesome treats using this. Unfortunately, the beaters were nowhere to be found. I was thrilled when I found the replacement beaters still available on Amazon! They are PERFECT and work wonderfully. Thanks for a great product and making these available after so many years!"
4,"Well written, good adition for your Tarot library","I received this book last week and started using it with the readings immediately. The style of writing is clear and precise. Although the book describes the reversed meanings of cards, each card is first described with its upright original meaning. The book is illustrated with Rider Waite deck pictures which might annoy some people but for beginners and those in love with all things medieval this is a plus.The upright descriptions are really useful but the book will help you in using reversals even if you used them before buying this book, like myself.I do not agree with some psychological interpretations of the author which is the only reason this book gets 4 stars. Otherwise if you are looking to explore Tarot in depth, besides the usual quick interpretations, get it!"
4,Complete Book of Tarot Reversals,Good Book and I learned some thing about reversals that helped in my readings.
2,Did I miss something too?,"I was Looking for a book about reversals, and I read so many great reviews that I got mine.I'm not saying the book is bad, I'm so not qualified to do so, but what I didn't like was the tone: ""oh we're so good, our tarot community is so great, we're so cool""...pleeease.About the book: never got around to finish it, got bored."
4,Mary Greer's tarot reversals,"This is a terrific book! there aren't too many books with reversal interpretations that actually make you want to continue to read the reversed meaning. She gives you descriptions of the many ways you can read reversals, including the Shamanistic view for each of the RWS cards (which is why I bought this book in the first place). Reversals are not cut & dry and Ms Greer takes you to a different level of reading them."
2,Very disappointed!,"The descriptions in this book are very WORDY for both the upright and REVERSED card, but they are no use if you are using the card to try to read for yourself or others. This is more like an encycyclopedia describing each card; you can get that from any source. A good tarot book to me is one that gives the meaning and tells you how to apply the meaning if you have picked that card related to a question."
4,"Bright Eyes, before the folk","Before Conor Oberst was writing his more popular folk influenced songs, made popular by ""Lifted"" and ""I'm Wide Awake..."", his music was was catergorized by the music on this album: more rock influenced, acoustic guitar lead indie music.While I wont say these six songs are his best, they are certainly good, especially if you consider yourself a big Bright Eyes fan. The lyrics are still really good and introspective, and are overall pretty upbeat. I definatly recommend this, or if you want a little bit of a variety get the four songs on the split with Son Ambulance. I bought this for trhe additional two songs."
2,Product not in the condition as described!,"Due to all of the fires in the neighborhood, I was in a hurry to buy this ladder. It was not as described and did not have all of the legs attached. It really impossible to screw them on. Really cheap plastic. I was really disappointed, for the price and should have gone with another vendor. The ladResQLadder FL35 Four-Story Portable Emergency Escape Ladder, 35 Foot"
5,FL25 Three-Story Ladder,This is the escape product we needed to get out of a high bed room in the event of a fire..
3,Kindle edition leaves something to be desired...,"I wanted to read Faust again in both the German and the English, and downloaded both versions of the first part to my Kindle Fire. While the FREE English version here does have a table of active content links, none of the graphics (illustrations) downloaded. They all appear as horizontal dark lines - a disappointment, but not a tragedy. (The German FREE version has no table of contents, nor any graphics.) But, at least I have some Goethe on my new Kindle Fire - in both German and English. Will give me a chance to review and renew my non-native German."
4,Rhyme and Reason,"Faust is such a great book! I love the way it sounds when we read it out loud in class. (I am a teacher.) The other thing I like about reading it on my Kindle is that there are many words that even I don't know, and I can just click on the words to get their definitions. I also highlight words that I go back and put on the vocabulary quizzes. The more I delve into the study of Faust, the more I compare its cultural impact to that of Star Wars. It had such an impact -- worldwide -- and so many other stories spun off of its ideas. Mephistopheles is as well known as Darth Vader!"
4,Faust,Faust is challenging. It's worth the struggle. It has wisdom and eternal truths. I like the poetry. There is depth of meaning. I highly recommend it.
3,Off Label Use,"My Vet told me to give this medication to my 12 year old Westie who was diagnosed with Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. At first, he seemed to be much better -less confused and less aggressive. Unfortunately, his behavior change only lasted a few weeks and I had to put him down last week after he attacked my other Westie."
1,Denosyl,"I ordered Nutramax Denosyl for Dogs Over 25 Lbs., 225mg - 30 Count on 11/23/11 it is now 12/26 and I am still waiting for the product. Can't review with out product."
5,Denosyl,My dog Bogart has a problem with his liver and needs to take this pill every day. I used to buy it at the vet's office and paid a MUCH higher price. Happily I found out that Amazon also sold this item and at a much LOWER price. I plan to do as much medication shopping as I need to right here at Amazon.
3,Good price,"Good price, compared to the Veterinarian's Office price. As far as effectiveness, I'll reserve my judgement until a later date as he's only been on it for two months. My dog's liver numbers haven't improved, but they haven't worsened either."
5,Absolutely awesome,"The hat is awesome and perfect except for no strap. I live around water and will lose hat if no strap. I just bought a leather shoe lace and sewed it in. Other than that it is supper. It keeps out the rain looks real good and is worth the money easy. Buy it, you will be surprised."
2,Mediocre but Reasonably Well-Researched,"As a professional actor and teacher of performance of some years, I found Mr. Harold's book both a refreshing take on ""acting Shakespeare"" and somewhat of a disapointment. While he does offer the reader some insight into the proper use of pentameter, rhythm, the beats of Shakespeare's language, he never manages to do more than that: provide some brief lesson or direction on a topic before shifting focus again to an entirely different area of study. The overall effect makes for a quick and easy read, one suitable to amateurs or high-school English classes, but not really appropriate for a professional or even semi-professional performance-instruction text. A solid effort that falls short of its mark and reputation, Harold's book left me wanting."
4,Too much Todd music is out of print,"I saw Todd on this tour and it was amazing. Never knew there was a live CD to document the tour. Too bad it (and the A Cappella CD) are both out of print. Looks like a similar track list, although I remember him doing ""I Saw the Light"" when I saw him."
1,Poor design - tips over too easily,"I bought this juicer and immediately returned it in favor of a ""standard"" manual levered juicer.This juicer looks nice on the counter, but that's where it's usefulness ends - its design just plain doesn't work! It tips over too easily when juicing lemons, limes, and oranges."
4,Congratulations! It's A Dead Boy.,"A must-have for your American punk rock collection!Nice 'n sleazy. Who needs love and romance?! Stivsings about getting some. ""Sonic Reducer"" is justa great tune. Attitude to burn. Check it out. Stivdied for you."
5,Dead but not forgotten,"The Dead Boys' debut album was a strong dose of classic snot-nosed punk - but this album brings you the very rawest and best alternative takes. It's like listening to a new album, and a good argument can be made that veteran punk fans will find this version even more powerful and appealing than the original. It's like having an indie version of a classic studio album, and in many cases the tunes are more powerful and immediate."
4,Sleazy and offensive-,"but I mean that in a good way. Like castor oil to the PC movement. Misogynous, solipsistic, arrogant, and REALLY FUN punk record. You really feel like youre slinking down the street with the band, kicking trash and smoking cigarettes with your one hand in your leather jacket. ""I don't really wanna dance-girl-I just wanna get in your pants""-a couplet from ""I Need Lunch"" to give you an idea of what territory you're heading into when you engage this. If you liked Fear alot, you'll love this."
3,pretty [...] good,"Anyway, this cd has some great songs, filled with attitude. I liked the whole cd, right from the start. Never a dull moment except for that [...] medley thing at the end. I rather just have an extra song."
2,As Ugly as Stiv's Death,"The first time I heard ""Sonic Reducer,"" I thought I had found another great punk band in the Dead Boys. Well, turns out I only found a great punk SONG...the Dead Boys, past their Nazi regalia and snotty attitude, have little more than some primitive sludgy metal riffs and ridiculous lyrics. Sure, they had the look down, but like most of the pathetic offspring of the first wave of punk, the Dead Boys had little to back up their phlegm and bondage pants. ""Sonic Reducer"" is the pinnacle of this band's career, so if that doesn't do it for you, stay away."
4,DEAD BOYS run a foul!,"Young, Loud and Snotty was the first disc from the Sex Pistols knock-offs the Dead Boys. Unlike their English counterparts, Y.L.S. sounds more like a punk album than a studio honed hard rock disc. Stiv Bators, Cheetah Chrome and company rip through these short punks tracks with a raw vengeance. Sonic Reducer became a classic punk anthem and the Dead Boys became American puk legends. Sadly the band didn't stick around. Stiv Bators became Stiv Bator and formed The Lords of the New Church (with The Damned founding member Brian James). Several years later, Stiv would succumbs to injuries from a car accident in Paris.A punk rock classic (but Sex Pistols knock-off). Strongly recommended."
1,They Ruined Punk Forever!,"Way before those half assed posers in England got wind of what was going on, the North East of the USA cranked out some amazing real punk music. Mostly from NYC, Boston, & Cleveland (yes Cleveland!) Music that was innovative, challenging, thought provoking, way ahead of it's time. Bands like The Modern Lovers, Pere Ubu, Television, Richard Hell & the Voidoids, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, & Devo. Then the Dead Boys came on the scene only to dumb everything down. Suddenly punk meant being obnoxious mean and spiteful. Punk shows before them were all about dancing and pogoing, really expressing your self. Then the Dead Boys got everybody to slam dance and stage dive. Sure I know you probably think thats cool but a lot of people get hurt that way. And their lyrics are so misogynistic, I can't believe anybody can actually listen to them. I just think it's so sad that for so many misguided kids, they have become the poster child for what punk rock is all about."
4,The Timeline here,"This band, formerly called Frankenstein when they were kicking around Cleveland -- a band that also included a future member of Pere Ubu -- were part of the famous N.Y. punk scene of the mid-70s. Their songs are just as the title says - young, loud and snotty. But what great songs. If you are not looking for great meaning, just some fun this is for you! These guys are punk originals not a knock-off of anything. (They were formed just about the same time as the Sex Pistols so how could they be a knock-off...please!!!)Anyhoo...from an original punk...I recommed this..."
1,Should not be marketed as a cold pack,I bought this product based on the manufacturer's claim that it could be put in the freezer and used as a cold pack. I have found that the filling inside of the packs is not appropriate for this use. After days in the freezer the pack barely gets colder than room temperature. It is certainly not cold enough to reduce swelling and inflammation. There are other products that have a clay filling that would do the job much better. I have not tried to heat it up in the microwave because I did not buy it for that purpose.
4,bed Buddy Joint wrap,"These seem to help with my carpel tunnel syndrome. They are easy to use. These heated did help with the pain, though only temporary. haven't tried them for anything else, but my wife said they helped her arthritus."
2,Not completely satisfied,"The product looked exactly as it appeared in the online ad when it arrived. The company that supplied it immediately followed up on its delivery and urged me to submit a positive review as to my satisfaction. I didn't know then what I know now. The charger didn't work at all. Three of the four batteries that came with it were ready to be charged but the fourth was a bad cell and wouldn't take a charge. I had to use a charger at work to determine what was wrong because the charger I purchased would go through the steps to make you think it was working, but actually did nothing. The indicator lights will flash at first, then after some time, they would turn solid green to make you think the batteries were charged. The batteries never charged, so now I'm sending it back for a refund."
2,Just ok,"It works, kind of big and who uses these anymore ? The batteries don't last long enough to bother and the think takes up a plug wherever you use it. its always there cause the Batts need constant charging. If you have a gadget that dosnt drain batts quickly then this gadget will serve your needs. Plus it wont overcharge the batts that is a good feature"
5,Outstanding songwriting,"Richard Hell's talent as a poet comes through in Blank Generation. He was probably the best songwriter the '70s era. This is one of the best, if not the best, punk albums of its time."
5,I like Richard Hell......,"....but I could never love all of this cd. I've always loved half the songs (esp. ""Blank Generation"", ""Love Comes In Spurts"") but half of these songs never grew on me. It's definitely better than anything by Television though!!!"
5,new york hell at its finest,"along with the ramones 1st, the dictators go girl crazy, & television's marqueen moon, this is the cream of the new york punk scene of the late 70's. its not just hell's yowling & groaning that makes this terrific, its the stellar guitar playing of the should be legendary robert quine. ignore the review that slams another world and all the way: all the way can be taken straight or as a joke, and another world is a twisted morass of guitar and voice that is better than rock and roll."
4,I belong to the _____Generation...,"Blank Generation was Richard Hell's first solo effort. The punk poet was part of the Heartbreakers before too many egos forced him to go out on his own. With his new band,he picked up Robert Quine and a few others to form the Voidoids. Richard Hell's music is about desperation and isolation instead of the usual punk themes of teenage angst and rebellion (years later, Richard hell laughs and mocks the punk scene). But during his heroin fueled youth, Richard Hell made some wonderful tunes.Strongly recommended."
4,To Hell & Back,"Richard Hell was a seminal figure in the New York punk scene of the mid 70's. Originally from Kentucky, he came to New York with fellow Kentuckian Television leader, Tom Verlaine. After playing in several bands (including an early version of Television) before forming his own band the Voidoids. Blank Generation is an aggressive, rocking album that is driven by the guitar work of Robert Quine and Ivan Julian. The band could pound out nihilistic tunes like ""Liars Beware"", ""Down At The Rock & Roll Club"" and ""Who Say? (It's Good To Be Alive)"". But Mr. Hell has a poetic tone to his lyrics (he has released a collection of poems) that separates him from the usual doom and gloom."
4,I can take it or leave it each time,"This was a landmark punk album in 1977. Two songs here, ""Love Comes in Spurts"" and ""Blank Generation, have rightly come to be regarded as punk classics. Oh, and the rest of the album is pretty good, too. Richard Hell may not have been the best singer, but he definitely had that ""punk rock"" attitude. Anyone interested in the roots of punk should get this CD."
2,Kind Of Wimpy,"I will admit, I bought this mainly to hear the guitar work of the great,late Robert Quine.Other than Quines usual fine guitar work, this struck me as pretty mediocre stuff. Hells vocals seem particularly wimpy compared to say Captain Beefheart,or Pere Ubu. Guess I was expecting a growl,what I got was a whine.Richard Heck maybe?"
4,What A Glorious Time,"I know I'm dating myself, but the 70's was a glorius time to be a teenager who loved rock. I bought ""Blank Generation"" at the same time as Ted Nugent's ""Cat Scratch Fever"" and wore them both out. It was the age of the anti-hero & I always thought Richard Hell was the first to put the moniker on our generation by calling it 'blank'. (It's my contention that the symbol 'x' was used to represent 'blank', but sometime in the 80s someone interpreted 'x"" literally and thus Generation X was coined instead. ) Well, it only counts that we had Richard Hell, as for the rest, we can take it or leave it each time."
2,Richard Hell & The Voidoids - 'Blank Generation' (Sire) 2 1/2,"Originally released in 1977, as this was Richard Hell's first lp. Reason I'm giving this CD reissue a 2 1/2 star rating is because I personally know old school fans of New York punk that may get more out of it that I did. Tunes here that kept this disc in my player ALL the way through were ""Love Comes In Spurts"", ""Betrayal Takes Two"", their John Fogerty cover ""Walking On The Water"" and the title cut ""Blank Generation"", Obviously, this disc didn't do much for me. Line-up: Richard Hell - bass & vocals, Robert Quine (R.I.P.) & Ian Julian - guitar & backing vocals and Mark Bell (aka Marky Ramone) - drums. Just might appeal to select fans of Television, Ramones, Dictators or Lou Reed."
1,"IF THIS IS ""PUNK""...","...then so is ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Except that's not entirely fair: ""Rocky Horror"" rocks harder."
2,Amateurish Production,"On War is one of several seminal political/historical books that come in a litany of editions, and it is for that reason I must warn anyone thinking of buying this version to avoid it. I was looking for a hardcover version specifically to have a nice, durable version for future reading. Instead, I got a travesty. The font size is inconsistent, the cover looks like it was resized in MSPaint (pixelation and poor definition) and even the formatting is inconsistent throughout (erratic hyphenation, ever changing margins). Do not waste your time and money on this one, there are far better copies available."
3,Confusing...,"While I have not had the opportunity to read through the book yet I have received it and just thought I'd share my initial perception and hopefully clarify some confusion. The first part of this book was binded with a publication entitled ""Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor"" and I've been searching at length to determine if there was some kind of connection that I was wholly unaware of, but being unable to find one I've determined it was probably an error on the part of the publishing company and leads me to disrecommend this particular version for anyone considering. I have to second the previous commenter's sentiment about the inconsistent sizing of the fonts and overall terrible formatting in this book. However, the content is all there and the binding is sturdy so I suppose if you don't mind the formatting this version may be for you."
3,Perfectly acceptable sound for the price,"This is a no-frills, entry-level sound card and that is perfect for me. I do not want surround sound from my PC. I was perfectly happy with the my on-board audio from my MSI mobo until I discovered that the line-in input was dead in the water. I do some basic recording direct to PC on occasion (rip a cassette/vinyl, record some synthesizer, etc.) so I picked up a cheap sound card to get me back in business.Typical PCI - very easy installation. The Creative install cd-rom walks you through the rest (though I wish it was packed with less garbage apps I do not need and have to skip installation of). My only complaint was that this card did not work well with Reaper DAW software using the standard audio drivers (on-board audio had worked fine, interestingly). I had to download the ASIO4ALL driver to get Reaper DAW running properly."
1,"Greedy business, Creative Labs","This product is still being sold by Creative Labs through Amazon, and this card or any other Audigy card has no service or tech support from CreativeLabs - it is stated ""End of Life"" in relation to service. Stay away from this company, they are just greedy - primitive business, isn't it? China is getting expensive... It is a shame - CreativeLabs. Finally, the card does not recognize 2.1 speaker system with subwoofer from Altec on advanced Dell PC where the ECC memory is supported. Certainly, ECC memory has nothing to do with the card compatibility. It is a 2006 product and still being sold by these crooks. If someone wants to join me in filing a lawsuit, please contact me through Amazon."
3,works great,"work great but no 64 bit support, on vista, windows 7 or windows 8. IF your running an 32bit OS no problem"
2,If you don't mind popping noises and system slowdowns...,"I'm running Windows 7 x64 on a quad-core intel cpu and 6GB of ram. When I installed this card the first thing I noticed was the popping/system slowdown/garbled noises that occurred when the system was under load. This card has issues with Windows 7 as well... the enhancement features couldn't be enabled (seemed to have no effect) and even after locating the appropriate drivers from Creative, the problem was not remedied. Its cheap, and you get what you pay for. Just know that before buying this product."
2,Limited capabilty,Does not appear to have a 2-channel stereo line input. Not usable with software defined radio. Very little technical documentation.
2,Maybe I just wound up with a bad card....,"I ordered this particular card from a dealer in used condition. It lasted about two months and then it died. I only spent $8.00 USD for it, so I'm not complaining but it was an inconvenience.If it worked fine when I installed it, then it should have continued to do so. there was nothing wrong with my computer and the seller told me it worked fine and so it did.Sometimes a bad one rolls off the assembly line too and dies later on....."
3,Not for direct recording with guitar,"This sound card works fine, and the audio quality is good for the price. However it will not work with guitar or mic instrument or direct-in recording. It is not ASIO compatible. Had to send back."
5,sound blaster,Installed easily and worked. My grandson is very pleased to be able to hear the Disney Playhouse site once more
1,audigy non-existant creative labs support doesn't work at all,creative labs cannot be contacted.they don't want to talk to you - they don't answer the phone.buy another brandthis audigy never worked and they loaded up my pc with cheap software.
5,Works great,The audio card works just fine and I'm very happy with it. It's not top-of-the-line but it is a very decent step up from integrated on-board audio.
2,Caution! Original PCI hookup,Be sure that your motherboard has an original PCI connection. Most should be mine was occupied my my ethernet card. I had to return and get one with a PCI-E hookup.
1,Won't work with Win 7 64bit,"I bought this card 4 years ago, while using XP, and it performed reasonably well. Last week I upgraded to Windows 7, 64 bit, and upon loading Win onto a new hard drive, Win notified me that the card needs an updated driver. I went to Creative's web site and found what I thought was a DL button for a Win 7 driver, but the button merely took me back to Support's home page. So I tried leaving an email message notifying Creative about their messed up link to the download. What a runaround! Their site had me running in circles trying to leave them a message! I tried this on 2 separate PCs using two separate browsers, same result. These guys really don't care about their customers. I'll give them a few more weeks to get that DL button working, after that never another Soundblaster for me!"
2,No Microphone Boost,"Contrary to what it says on the packaging, it does not work well with VISTA. In fact if you spend enough time on Creatives website and on other forums you'll find that many of their products don't work well with VISTA. The biggest issue I had was that it lacked a very basic feature: Microphone Boost. Without such a feature you cannot use your mic for online gaming. Simply maxing the mic outbound volume isn't enough...the 10 or 20 db boost is required for talking volumes to be registered. I returned the product and am still looking around for a suitable Vista sound card."
5,good stuff,"IMO, the Audigy by Creative is far better than on board audio of an Asus M4A78-E motherboard. Works great with Windows 7."
2,Soundblaster audigy review,"Installed easily and sounded great. A few days afterwards, the sound began to deteriorate, and the LINE IN feature, which I use a lot, began to work intermittently.Then it went out completely. So, I returned it for a replacement Soundblaster Audigy, which came promptly and it too, installed easily and sounded great. But , the LINE IN feature did not work at all!That was it. I had had it. If you have no need to rip any music files into your registry, I guess its ok.But for me. I bought an Xtreme Sound 7.1 sound card, for the same amount of money, and it works just fine. I would definetly 4 star that one."
2,Unable to get it to work with windows 7,"No matter how, or what I do; this sound card will not work with windows 7 32 bit. I have tried the drivers recommended, but nothing seems to work. I have the card installed, but that is all I can say about it. Am I unhappy with it....YES....."
2,Win-7 Blaster,"I followed the advice of another reviewer - I installed the card and expected WIndows to find drivers.Win-7 (32bit) did not recognize the card as anything. It did not look for drivers.So, I tried the install disk. It crashed my system - badly. Took some extreme measures just to make my system start. When it did, a message said take the new unknown device out of the computer.Bottom line... It does not seem to me it is compatible with Win-7. The box says it works with Vista and XP. It does not mention Win-7.I returned it. (I appreaciate Amazon's customer-friendly return process!)"
1,Broke after a few months of use,"I was very happy with this basic sound card until the color-coded plastic insulation for the sound-out jack broke into pieces and fell away. Not sure exactly how it happened. I do plug and unplug connectors into the jacks a lot so I guess the plastic insulation wasn't strong enough for that. On closer inspection, the plastic does seem to be the hard, brittle kind. I think a softer plastic is needed here. Anyway, the card is now unusable. I can make a connection, but I get a lot of noise and feedback without insulation around the plug. All of this happened after only 4.5 months of use. No idea if the manufacturer will replace it. Aside from this one problem, it was a perfectly acceptable sound card."
4,Creative Labs Audigy SE Sound Card,Good News! This card works under Win 7! Win 7 clearly has embedded drivers for this card so the card is recognized on OS boot and the drivers get installed automatically. Life should be easy! The sound quality is also pretty good. Buy the card!I would recommend this card for the decent price ($30) and that it works in Windows 7. Bad news is that i still see a yellow bang in Device Manager. Even with updated drivers from Creative no change was observed. Probably MS does not like my older HW (800MHz SE440BX2 system-still works great). i am not going to worry about though since it outputs audio fine like it is supposed to.
3,Great sound for small price,I am not a gamer nor do I listen to music on my PC but I wanted to have the ability to hear the audio content of movie trailers and videos uploaded to the net. For this purpose I didn't need anything that was extreme high-quality and this product is perfect for that.
5,EXECELLENT,This product was easy to install and for the money has greazt quality and easy to understan graphics. I strongly recommend this for people looking for something simple.
4,Blaster Card,"Standard sound card. I have used many and this one works as well or better than most. It has some features that many don't. My advise is to study the specs. of several (including your existing card) and if you don't know what some things mean, then find someone to ask before you buy. You may avoid spending money for something you don't need."
2,It's fine...,"This card is good for windows 7, 8 channels, good sample rate, drivers are awesome. But....Card does NOT have front panel connector, it's my fault because I didn't get the info first but I thought all cards had it (I was young and foolish back then)... I use my front jacks heavily so it was a turn down.I Couldn't get it to work fully in Debian Linux, after a month of researching (and reinstalling) I got bored and stop trying. ALSA will give you 2 channel output no matter what you do, some hacks can route the sound to all your speakers, but will only work with *some* applications, other applications like totem and flash player would hang. And don't even think of watching a movie in 5.1, because it will NOT work.Pulseaudio would hang randomly with this card. It seems chipset CA106 is not very well supported under Linux.So I end up buying a HT | Omega striker 7.1 after a month of having this card, to which I also wrote a review (It's good but not perfect)."
1,Unit Failed Defective,The Sound card failed and no longer works. No sound from my games and Bad echoing from YouTube video. Remove from computer and stored!
1,This is not a low profile Sound Card,"I was doing a search for low-profile sound card and this product came up in the search. If you need to get a low profile sound card. Don't get this one. At one time, this sound card was supported to enable it to fit in a low profile computer, but not any more. Don't get this sound card!"
2,KrudKutter Gutter Cleaner,I tried the product as directed and it did not work as promised on my just 3 year old gutters. Tried it on my neighbours 40 year old ones and it worked fine. E-mailed the company and they had no explanation. It surely was a total waste of money for me.
4,"So good in many ways, but...","I used this planner for the last two school years. It has so much going for it. I used many of the suggestions included on every page. It is packed with tips and it is a very handy place to record contact numbers for school, infomation on subs, professional development hours and much more. Unfortunately, I decided not to use the planner this year because it is not set up for teachers having more than one (maybe two) preps. I had three preps the last two years, so I manually drew in lines separating each page into thirds. This year I am teaching four different classes; there is no way to make it work.It would be extremely useful to offer this planner in a loose leaf format so that it would be adaptable for teachers with more classes to plan for."
1,Not worth the money,"This should be given free to all teachers, it is very expensive when most yearbook companies give away calendars to all the teachers annually. Use that calendar, and pick up your bible. It'll save you $15+."
2,The Children's Shakespeare,This was not the book I thought I was purchasing. I was looking for a version that I read back in the early 90's written for elementary age kids. This book is not for elementary age kids-- not what I read about in other reviews.
5,beautifully written story,"this book gives us a better than average story on superman's early life. it starts with the meter shower that brought him to earth and the devastating affects it had on the town and citizens of smallville. then it jumps to his 15th year where heis a teenager with extraordinary abilities that he cannot figureout because his adopted family has left him in the dark. ...teenagers do kiss, use profanity and a lot worse. the use of profanity is very slightand definitely not worth mentioning. ...i think that most people would enjoy it ... if you did not see thefirst episode this will more than bring you up to date."
5,Well-Written Adaptation of Smallville,"Arrival starts off the hit television show Smallville in a readable, visually-written Smallville book tie-in series. Though it is based on the first episode, Michael Teitelbaum was able to capture the episode into a teen book that still entertains, is true to the television show, and manages to give you more insight into the background of each character. If you collect the Smallville book series, you should have this one."
2,Not the best,"My toddler loves puzzles and usually melissa & doug's are great, but I am not happy with this one. The 'dazzling' shiny pieces make the picture hard to see & the pieces are all the same shape - so it's quite hard to put together, even for me. Also, a couple of the pieces have started peeling and they are very stiff and have to broken apart individually when you want to start over."
4,SongXpress Soft Rock Vol 1,"Soft Rock Vol.1* Danny's Song BEGINNER* If INTERMEDIATE* Melissa BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE* Sister Golden Hair BEGINNERThis SongXpress release is a good tape for beginners looking to push themselves a little harder. While none of the tunes here should be insurmountably hard for beginners to learn, they are also not three chord tunes that can be learned in a minute. The gentle ""If"" is a great example of a song that isn't TOO difficult to play, yet sounds as if it is quite tough, and should provide guitarists with a song that they can use to thoroughly impress all their friends. Instructor Tommy Anthony thankfully deals a little more with right hand strumming patterns in Soft Rock Vol.1 than he does in most other videos in the series.THIS IS NOT MY REVIEW, however, the first review complained about not knowing the listing - which I agree with, but come on folks, this is the internet, one second on Google lets me know what this is."
2,If It only had dialog,"The premise was interesting and the actors did a respectable job but they were given such poor dialog. When a screen writer resorts to constant use of the F word and obscenities to ""punch up"" the scene you know that there is a limited to the writer's skills. Too bad this was the case in this movie. I, like others who reviewed this movie, thought that the last half was not as interesting as the first half; I honestly could not wait to get it over. I was glad I only spent a total of $2.99 from Amazon for this movie; 1 cent for the movie and $2.98 for shipping.By the way the ""Not Rated"" listing should be an ""R Rating"". The language was too rough for a PG rating."
2,Just doesn't add much to the SoC experience,"The ships act essentially as roads, and the islands serve only to slow down gameplay, and make confrontations with other players less likely. I would not recommend this as an add on to the base settlers game.Cities and Knights is a far superior way to get more out of your SoC experience."
2,"Good arrangements, second rate vocals",The musical arrangements are tasteful and well done. The vocal performances for the most part are disappointing and in some cases amateurish.
5,Old Tatari for 100% Pure-Ear,"This is the first Boredoms recording i got. Old School Tatari at it's finest. Molecicco, Telehorse Uma , Hoy , Cory & The Mandara Suicide Pyramid Action or Gas Satori: are classic examples of the style."
3,Is There Any Escape?,"The screams and thrashing of these Japanese stars will leave most people asking ""Where's the music?"" But if you think the 4/4 rock/pop boxes all sound alike, this will get your mojo back in alignment. Buzzes, pops, near-tribal drum sounds, and almost-synthetic noises crash up against your ears and demand attention. If nothing else, one must agree that the sounds produced on this album are genuine and spontaneous. For adventurous listeners only."
2,Okay but politically correct liberal bias included,"I had to buy this book for class and while I enjoy some of the discussion sections for each chapter, I think it lacks aspects which would make this better for students. Not to mention, it is politically correct, liberal in some of its comments which some conservatives won't like. I bought from the marketplace sellers so hopefully not giving money to the original author/companies. The book should include vocabulary separately, so you can isolate and memorize key concepts of the chapters. It also seemed to jump around in topic. When you are trying to understand new concepts, that is not a good idea. It is hard to correlate what they are saying, with what you need to learn."
5,The Big City Belongs to the Ramones,"Back in the day, the King Biscuit Flower Hour was an incredible FM radio mainstay which featured concert performances from many artists who represented a number of musical genres.These 27 tracks of sizzling punk rock aired on the syndicated program and were recorded at the Palladium om January 7, 1978. Keeping the beat on drums is Tommy Ramone, who soon left the band.This is as outstanding means to hear the Ramones as they ripped through a set before an appreciative audience. The group paved the punk rock trail and this gig demonstrates the power and energy that made them a ""must-see"" act when their tour rolled into the city."
2,You won't like unless your a faithful Ramones fan.,"This album was incredibly disappointing to me, but obviously I'm not a big Ramones fan. I respect the Ramones, but this album I just didn't like. I usually am a little wary of live albums anyway, because I would've rather been there than listening to them talk to the crowd instead of me. Anyway, it has all of their early classics, but the album just got on my nerves. Especially, when they count 1-2-3-4 before they start every song, it just drives me crazy in a bad way. But, I still respect them for starting the punk rock movement. Without them, some of my favorite bands wouldn't exist, so hats off to the Ramones, but not this album."
3,Dinosaur solo.,"Anybody might like this disc, but I'm gonna say it's mostly a fans-only kind of thing. Just a man and his guitar. I like it because I'm a huge fan of course, and it's nice to hear these songs in a new way. I saw J on this small tour, and he played well and was rather funny if I remember right. The songs I like most are ""Thumb"", ""Get Me"", ""Goin Home"", and ""Keeblin"". I also love the covers of ""The Boy With The Thorn In His Side"" (Smiths), and ""Anticipation"" (Carly Simon). Good choices."
1,just disc two of season 1 what a waste,misleading makes you think you are getting second season when its is simply disc two of season one by itself dumb since the first season is sold as a set. I had to send mine back for credit.
1,Radar Gun,"I purchased this as a gift, it never worked, sent it back and as usual Amazon was great on the return, I did purchase the Bushnell speedster III, it works and the small of amount of extra money is worth it.I have 2 granddaughters who pitch softball and they always want to know ""how fast was the pitch"" Now they can find out."
5,Bushnell Speed Gun,Product was delivered promptly and a few were returned to exchange for another product. Return was easy and there were no problems.
5,passin it on,"had heard about this documentary before i purchased, thought it was more of a general doc about the panthers, not one that focused more on dhoruba bin wassad; however, it was still pretty good, and i never really knew too much about wassad previously so it turned out to spark a different curiosity about getting to know and read wassad more."
5,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable book with strong characterization, good plotting, and very interesting themes. Chai has a gift for beautiful, descriptive prose that doesn't slow down the story-telling. Hard to believe this is his first novel. My son Aaron, who's 16, also enjoyed the book, and that saying something right there."
3,Great Idea But...,The picture on the sticker wears off within a few weeks! So then you just have a blank circle sticker in the shoe. That helps no one!
3,Great text...beware the illustrations,"First, this book is full of information. Read it twice and then keep it handy for reference... Micheal Brown clearly knows and cares a lot about rope rescue. My congratulations and thanks to him for distilling what he knows into this work.However, I hope there's a revision in the works to correct some of the issues in the illustrations. After looking closely at the text and the illustrations, I have to advise relying only on the information in the text and not expecting the good info there to be repeated in pictorial form...(For example, the lock-off described in figure 4-41(A) doesn't even start with the eight plate rigged correctly. And I think figure 9-21(B) is the diagram for a magic trick...there are more than 2 ends for some of those ropes...)"
4,Review,"This book has a lot of good pictures to help illustrate various points and safety practices. There is a great deal of information located in this book and would make a great addition to any resource library.There are a couple of places where I feel the author leads one to believe that the method described in this book is the ONLY way to do something, or that a particular piece of equipment is the ONLY one that can be used in a given situation. I personally don't tend to follow those kinds of thinking, and suggest looking in several different resources before you make any hard and fast rules for yourself; and of course ALWAYS get good qualified instruction on anything you are not sure about. This book will definitely help you to become more comfortable with any practices and procedures you may be unclear on, as well as reinforce others you may be completely comfortable with.I'm glad I own it, and I refer to it often."
1,Disappointing from the Get-Go...,"This book may well have been titled ""Whining & Dining Our Way from One Bad Hotel to the Next Across France"". The walking pair, British ""Wall Street"" Miles and wife Guislane, set out on a month long stroll from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. What could have been a picturesque, inspiring and informative triumph quickly becomes a hip-aching, blister-breaking, ""where's my Evian"", husband-wife downer. Throughout the walk, Guislane is fervently scribbling notes in her journal - if only she had offered some interesting commentary on what was going on around them instead of between them! No town seemed to impress them; no river, castle, lodging, meal, or outfit seemed to gain their favor. They drank a lot, which I can fully appreciate considering the disdain they seemed to find in each agonizing (for the reader as well) kilometer. You learn very little about France, but much about the cranky Morlands."
4,More about marraige than walking,"This book is not so much about walking across France as it is about the relationship between a middle-aged husband and wife. I agree with the previous reviewer that Morland chose the wrong part of France to walk and the wrong time of year to walk it. Worse still, he followed roads instead of trails. I would never do what he did! It is an easy read, though, and it is inspiring to read about two people with no physical training who simply packed up one day and walked 15-20 miles every day for a month. My wife is now taking seriously my suggestion that we do the same"
5,"forget self-help, go for a walk!","READ THIS BOOK! Forget self-help and buy this! If you are in need of a laugh, an inspiring marriage to aspire to, motivation to get off your arse and exercise despite years of misuse and have never been to France or have been but can't be there now... then .....READ THIS BOOK.You might also learn abit too."
4,More Enjoyable than Bryson's A Walk in the Woods!,"Perhaps a bit unfair, I read this first, before I read Bryson's latest. Also, I could relate a little easier to a walk of a more modest length than a 2000 plus mile walk. I'm a bit of a francophile, and I could picture the small towns and hamlets, the tiny bistros and some of the less than pleasant hotels. It was a wonderful way to take a vacation and not have the blisters. Great reading for a cold and rainy November when you could use a vacation, but know there's none in sight!"
3,The Travels of an Inspired Type A,"To choose a long walk (about 350 miles) is inspirational. What's troubling is a narrator who lacks the self-awareness to see the silliness in making up rules like ""seven minute breaks."" Miles, this proverbial type-A personality, thinks he's mellowing, loosening up, leaving Wall Street thinking behind. But he's a complete control freak who refuses to even let his wife see his bible of maps. One hopes that he'll grow and even poke fun at his rule making. But he never does. Still, this is not a bad book. It's just waylaid by a bourgeoisie label-conscious demand for Evian. Part of it might be the sophistication of seeing Europe as an easy adult playland. Aspects of the marriage are revealed that are really quite daring, much like the choice of undertaking the adventure. As far as the decription of food and wine, it wasn't particularly knowledgeable nor descriptive. Maybe it's just too dated."
5,Butler's Lean Treats,"My dog absolutely loves these ""Lean Treats"". I give her medication in the treats or give them to her for snacks. They are low fat so I don't have a problem giving them. She is a 90 lb german shepherd and now because I found them on Amizon I buy them by the case. Sedona is very happy!"
5,Butler Lean Treats,Excellent service. Product was received on time. Product fresher than when purchased from our vet.Will purchase again from this vendor.
4,LOVE these IF they're fresh!,"I've given these to my dog for the 4 years that I've had her. I LOVE them, and the fact that they're good for her! I recently ordered them from Entirely Pets, as my vet was out of them. I ordered a 6-pack, and it was wonderful -- fresh and soft. This is important, as my dog only has 3 teeth left. Too, I put a small pill in half of one if these, to give to Mitzi. Unfortunately, the second (and final) order for a 6-pack was dried out. And when they're dried out, they're really tough. I suppose I could've returned them, but I gave them to a coworker with a younger dog, who could chew them. Decided I wouldn't order online again, given this experience...I'll get them from my vet, and I open one of the packs before leaving to make sure they're fresh."
5,Pups love lean treats,"Hi, In potty training my pup, I used lean treats for reward and it worked beautifully. My dogs still look for their treat when they come in from the yard and are always rewarded. These treats are healthy and were recommended by my veterinarian."
5,A Practical Guide for Both Men and Women considering Retirem,I was most interested in this book since I just finished writing a book about those who choose not to retire. This book contains a great many very practical worksheets for the reader. One can weigh the payoffs one needs from a job or activity as well as ones own skills and interests. Great idea! I wish I had thought of being so practical when writing my own book. Also very useful were the three appendices of resources.
4,smells so good,"Although I think these candles are a bit pricey for there size . I love that there scents carry through out my house . My favorite scent so far is "" Fresh Cut Tuberose "" . It smells very nice , everyone always compliments how great it smells : )"
5,"l920's Comedian,One of the best","I ran across this movie one night on TCM station. Had never heard of Max Linder. Then remembered the book,""The Silent Clowns"", where Linder is given credit for stunts copied by later comedy stars. I rate hime right up with Keaton,Chaplin,and Laurel & Hardy"
5,"Nice item, fair price.","the book arrived quickly, well packed and protected. It's a nice little collection of Frost poems that was obviously used and enjoyed by a previous owner. Several pages are marked with sprigs of clover which the reader may have grasped at while reading somewhere out of doors!"
3,"Not bad, but...","..by far from the best version of this splendid work. That honour belongs to Gardiner's brilliant live recording in San Marco, followed by Suzuki's recording with the Bach Collegium Japan. The Boston Baroque version is also better. So, what's the problem? Basically, the thing has no life. This is a magnificent work that, in my opinion, cries out for a powerful performance. It doesn't get it here. I have this version, but I rarely play it."
5,Yanni!!!!,Hey I have been a dedicated Yani fan for over 20 years now and go to any concert with in traveling distance of him and always get floor of stage seats.
1,It's MIDI!,"If you love MIDI music, this CD is for you. If real instruments had been used, it might have been half decent. The fake drum in Track 4 is the worst."
1,Dont waste your money,It doesnt fit my regular psp system. I wouldnt advse to buy this. No where on the packaging does it state for a different psp. First time I had a problem with a product.
4,not for beginners,"Much of the book's material is best appreciated with at least an undergrad degree in maths or computer science. A typical computer programmer, who has not had to delve deeply into theoretical maths, might be treading water. The presentation style assumes a strong background in the rigorous proving of theorems.Nor are there any convenient code snippets. If it's actual code, you'll need to translate from the abstractions of the text."
4,Old New England Wisdom stirs the spirits.,"Ah! Here is a journey back in time to the values that built the nation. A blend of history, folklore, humor, and morals entertains us a curious way. This is one the whole family will want to see more than once."
5,STORY TELLING AT ITS GREATEST,"Great ""Saturday afternoon"" movie to sit back, watch and enjoy. For both young and old."
5,"5 stars for the movie, but only 2 stars for the overpriced DVD","For the ridiculous prices they charge, Criterion DVDs are frequently underwhelming. The Devil and Daniel Webster is one of the worst Criterion offerings I've seen. The picture is bad enough, with shots and whole scenes marred by prominent vertical scratch marks, and many shots dimmed by vignetting that is not part of the original cinematography. But even worse is the sound, which is plagued by out-of-balance dynamics and a loud, annoying hiss throughout the whole film. The movie itself is great, however, and worth buying used or at a discounted price if you can find it, in spite of the unfortunate Criterion B-grade production. One can only hope that at some point the kind of care and professionalism that many more reasonably priced DVD producers lavish on their disks will be matched by Criterion."
1,1 star for the poor transfer 5 stars for the movie,The many many vertical white lines and the constant hissing on the soundtrack makes this so not worth the $40 Criterion charges. Same with their transfer of Oliver and Great Expectation.
3,criterion is losing steam,I can't fault the extras but the film itself was not up to the standards set by Criterion. There was not one frame that wasn't scratched. I expected far better. Will not be buying from their catalogue again.
4,The Devil and Daniel Webster,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
1,The Devil and Daniel Webster,I went through 3 different DVD players that play DVD-2 as well as DVD -1. It would not play. After a couple of visits with computer experts and still being unable to view it I gave up and shredded it. It was a waste of money!
3,"Sugar Free, Flour Free, Gluten Free Spiced Pumpkin Walnut Cookies - Low Carb","The cookies are great; they taste almost like pecan sandies. One precaution is that the seller asks for a direct signature (meaning, they want YOUR signature, not anyone else's), so I had a very difficult time getting them since I'm not around when FedEx delivers during the week. I eventually got them, but I would not order from this seller again because of this pain. It took FedEx 3 times to deliver it finally and while the product was very good the hassle of shipping/recieving was too much to make it worth it at this price."
1,Terrible,"I'm a fan of a lot of Oakies' stuff - but this mix absolutely did not do his name any justice - keep surfin', this cd is terrible."
1,awful,"I bought this because I really like Paul Oakenfold and he mixed this cd. Thank god he doesn't sound like this anymore. Maybe it's just dated, but this cd is a mix of Jock Jams and really cheesey house anthems"
2,This is Oakie?!,"I hadn't heard of this cd before I saw it in the store, and I got it because it's Oakenfold. But this isn't the same Oakenfold sound as on his Cream Resident cd, or his Global Underground NY cd, and certainly not like his essential mixes. The first three tracks are terrible, though after that it's not as bad, though compared to some of Oakie's stuff, this is trash. The few songs that aren't completely horrible are what stopped me from giving this a 1. Save your money and get Tranceport, or head over to the Sasha section."
2,Not really worth buyin,"Don't just buy cds because of a name. Oakenfold is incredible don't get me wrong, but man this cd just well... its not what you'd expect. yea these are mostly just club tracks from the late 90's. Go ahead and just get a different mix by him. but still becarful what you get. You might not like it."
2,"I'd got it, now it's gone, I wanna it back","what I have had is a box set of movie hits which is different from the set introduced here ( ""Today's movie hits""/performed by the countdown singers, Rel.1995), 2/3 of my set are in this set, some of them are familiar for people all of the world, some are ordinary. My friend lent them from me and never return them back. Now I need to buy them again. :-) I don't know whether it is saled in China? please help me to buy it ok?"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"How come we can't rate an item with 0 Stars? This album is so disappointing and I loved her debut. I wish I previewed it beforehand. I hope she saved her money, cause she has lost alot of fans after this disaster !"
4,Here for the party again,"Here for the Party was great but this album seems like it was rushed to capitalize on Gretchen's success. However, it still has some good tunes like ""Politically Uncorrect"", the title track, and the surprisingly good remake of the jazz standard, ""Good Morning Heartache"". I read many reviews criticizing Gretch on not being a good role model. Well, if you're looking for a role model, you shouldn't be listening to country music!!"
1,Why copy-protected?,"I have waited for months for this cd to be released, only to find out it is copy protected. I make a copy of all my cd's to carry in my truck so I don't get the original scratched up; I keep it safe at home so if something happens to the copy I can still make another from the original. It's sad that they did this to this cd, because now I won't buy one; I will not carry the original around with me. Sorry Gretchen, you should have thought more about your fans needs instead of listening to the big-wigs."
5,Gretchen does it again!,Gretchen's second album is as good as the first. I was skeptical that she could pull off another great all around album. I enjoyed all the songs and if you are a true country fan you will enjoy it. She pays homage to the traditional country which is very absent in today's country singers. The bonus track is also a nice treat. I was a little surprised that it was not a country song but it shows that she has great range as a singer. It's nice to know that we still have a couple of really talented country singers left.
1,How long can we be the poor girl??,this cd is so white trash and gross that it makes me sick that gretchen Wilson is so popular .. in the beginning she looked like she could last and be a staple and bring back classic country but now she has just gotten even more white trash and she is the farthest thing now from a poor girl as they come i wonder if she has a trailer she writes in on her land with her 2 million dollar home yeah that sounds ruff.. from the moment i listened to this cd i threw it away buy song 4 she failed with this cd big time
3,Not as good as her first album.,"This is a good album. It just ain't as good as her first one. Im my opinion, it could of been better. I am a HUGE Gretchen Wilson fan. I'm not dissin' her. I just thought her second album would out do her first. And in my opinion, ""Here For The Party"" was the best. I would still recommend this album."
1,God this is AWFUL!,"Her last album had ""Redneck Woman."" This one has....well NOTHING! She is going to go down in history with all the other one hit wonders. She clearly needs to go to school and get an education. The song about being one Bud Wiser, a play on the name of the beer, is one of the lamest and desperate plays on words ever to appear in a song. It's also an insult to anyone who's lost someone to drinking and driving. It's like she's glorifying drinking. It's very irresponsible. But then again, she includes a song about Skoal...a substance which causes mouth cancer. I know her fans are mostly uneducated rednecks, but they still deserve better than this!AND...The song ""He Ain't Even Cold Yet:"" is one of the poorest excuses of a song in history. It's apparently about a woman who goes out partying before they even bury her husband's dead body. What trailer park did Gretchen Wilson crawl out of?This cd is also on Sony....so beware. They install spyware on computers. DON'T TRUST THEM!"
1,Country Music Sinks To An All Time Low,"The female answer to Hank Williams Jr? I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!Comparing her to Hank is an insult to Hank. At least Hank has some singing talent. Gretchen will be gone in about 2 years. She is a marketing ploy by the record companies to appeal to rednecks who have had to many beers on a Saturday night. To like this garbage, you have to be drunk. Where's Hank,George & Merle when you need them?"
1,Trashy,"Trashy woman, trashy music. Nothing original here folks...Ranting about materialistic women seems to be her theme. Igot to admit, I don't like materialistic women, but thatdoesn't mean I'm going to be attracted to her proud whitetrash self.The worst part is that on her second album she's alreadyre-writing the same song (Redneck Woman/California Girls)so that doesn't bode well for the future for her."
1,Copy Protection,It's great to see that Amazon is warning us of copy protected CD's. I hope that enough fans boycott this practice to make the industry take note .... I know that I will.
2,"Expected More, Will Wait for Number III","I eagerly awaited this sophmore release from Gretchen, but in the end, I'm afraid it turned into ""Here for the Party: Part II"" While it was Redneck Woman and Here for the Party that broke Gretchen out into the open - she's taken something that was fresh and fun and not delved any deeper. With each release there should be some degree of growth in an artist, and this one just doesn't show it. I had difficulty in sitting through the entire album, and now it lies mostly forgotten in my iTunes library. This is coming from someone who has completely worn out her disc with Gretchen Wilson's debut...."
3,A little cheese with that whine,"I actually like the entire cd for the most part. It's a valid sophomore attempt. However, if one is going to do a cover song, they should make sure they have something to bring to the table. Right about now, Billie Holliday is spinning in her grave over the whiny, hollow rendition of Good Morning Heartache."
3,A little more Merle...,"I, like most of you, loved the 1st single and title track of this album. It had the same attitude and style as the hits ""Redneck Woman"" and ""Here for the Party"" that brought Gretchen to superstardom. I was slightly (and I stress slightly) less impressed with the rest of the All Jacked Up album. I'm sure there are many people out there who will love this album even more than her first because there are a lot more songs with a traditional country twang to them.Gretchen does have her shining moments like with track 6, ""I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago."" Why didn't any songwriter think of that witty little ditty sooner? And I thoroughly enjoyed the subject matter in songs like ""Skoal Ring"" and ""Not Bad for a Bartender"". I'm sure, like most new artist albums, her debut was controlled by the record company to produce as many mainstream hits as possible. You can tell Gretchen put a lot more of herself into this album than in her first. It's definitely worth a listen."
3,The Party Continues,"Interesting follow-up to 'Here For The Party'....This is Gretchen Wilson's 2nd CD.....Of course, we have 'All Jacked Up' one of my favourites on this CD as well as 'I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today'"
1,The ugly truth about copy-protected CDs,"I was devastated when I found out that this CD has copy-protection software. I love Wilson and eagerly anticipated this CD, but now that the ass-clowns at the record label have made this CD copy-protected, it's worthless to me. Memo to the music industry: make your CDs compatible with iTunes! Otherwise, expect CD sales to continue to suffer. Avoid!"
3,Just Okay...Not What I Expected From Her AT ALL,"Well I absolutely ADORED Gretchen Wilson's first album ""Here For The Party""--it had fun songs and sappy ballads, and it was just so balanced and great. With ""All Jacked Up"", I expected pretty much the same thing, if not better. Most of the upbeat songs all sound the same--beer drinking, tobacco chewing, etc. There are only 3 ballads, but with the exception of ""He Ain't Even Cold Yet"" (which is just ""okay""), they're all pretty good. I'm not saying that all of these songs are bad, I just wanna know: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VARIETY, GRETCHEN?!?! Now I still do love Gretchen, and I look forward to her next album, but I hope it's better than ""All Jacked Up""."
1,ANOTHER PIECE OF JUNK!!!,Her first was bad enough but Wilson has reached a new low here. This CD is a waste of money for those who desire first rate stuff and class during the proceedings. This is junky trash all the way.
1,Sophmore Jinx Strikes Again.......,"I loved Gretchen's first CD ""Here For The Party"". However, her second release ""All Jacked Up"" leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully, she will see this album as a ""lesson learned"" and will do better with her next CD."
3,Pretty good CD,"I haven't listened to this cd that much but I love her ""All Jacked up"" Didn't care some of the others but this is why you have cd burners. I liked her first CD better but still a fan."
5,A Hard-To-Find Product,"Normally most 220 volt Electric Dryer cords are about 4 feet long. I needed an 8 footer, but none were available anywhere locally. So I found a 10 footer on Amazon and ordered it immediately. The price was right although the shipping fee was ridiculous. The product is well made (heavy duty) and solved my problem. It's now hooked up to my dryer and works fine. Simple as that."
3,The only thing in the box was the cord.,"When the box got here and when I opened it, the cord was just laying there. There was no plastic case for the cord like the smaller ones come in when you buy them from a store. The cord looks a little dirty and I could see light through the corners of the shipping box. I hope this cord is new and not refurbished, the description doesn't say anything about either. This is the only place I could find to buy a longer dryer cord.... On another note, it did ship really fast."
3,It was more Informative when I was a kid.,It has been 38 years since I've seen this. I remembered more teaching and less cartoon. Still It was a good group of films to start a young Interest In science.
3,Something's missing!,"I love these old films, and the picture quality on this disc is top-notch, but I have to give it a mediocre review because this version of ""Our Mister Sun"" has been edited. There's something missing in the opening credits, as evidenced by an obvious still-frame that's been superimposed over the sequence, and the closing are credits are COMPLETELY MISSING! There's just a still-frame image that says ""The End."" Very poorly done.This copy of ""Cosmic Rays,"" though, seems to be all there.I recommend this disc for fans of this series, but you need to be aware that ""Mr. Sun"" is incomplete. There are no extras on the disc, either."
5,The most integrated book covering the subject,I've been using this book for more than 12 years of practice (several editions) and I found it's the best for both students and practicing engineers. One of the good things about it is that it covers the theory as well as the code provisons for practice and makes the logical connections in the shortest wy it can be done.
2,strip method for slaps,"The strip method gives results on the safe side,which is certainly preferable in practice,and differences from the true carrying capacity will never impair safty."
1,Intonation?,"The back of the CD calls Scarlet Rivera ""one of America's foremost female violinists."" Perhaps she has given good performances elsewhere. Unfortunately on this CD she has a severe problem playing in tune. This is unfortunate, because the other artists seem perfectly competent."
5,Hemo,"Excellent movie, although it's older than I am. I first saw it in elementary school and now show it to my college cardiopulmonary anatomy & physiology students."
3,Science TV Show From the 50's,"The DVD brought back memories of seeing this in 1957 and 1958!It's very dated in places, but the comment that we may be starting global warmingwas prescient! This was fifty years ago, remember!"
4,Hard driving sound with a questionable playlist,"This live recording did capture the raw power of Husker Du. The guitar is blaring, the bassline thumping and the drumming? Forget about it, about as fast as you can get. This was hardcore Husker Du doing hardcore Husker Du. HOWEVER, so many of their great songs are omitted in this concert. And I know someone is going to say ""well they had so many great songs."" Yeah, but no ""Don't Want to Know if You are Lonely"" or ""Makes No Sense At All""? Give me a break."
2,What's The Fuss About?,"I don't understand all the hoopla about Husker Du. To me, they sound like any random hard rock band. I have heard dozens of bands like this play the LA strip, most thankfully have faded from memory. Perhaps Husker Du made an impressive statement live, but I never saw them and this album does not really present the case well. The surprising thing about them is the reverence with which the critics treat them. They don't deserve it."
4,Husker Du live!!!,"Plainly stated, much (most?) of what is heard over the airwaves these days simply wouldn't exist without the influence of Husker Du. I've always regretted that I didn't descover these guys until years after their breakup; but at least now I've got this excellent document to remind me of what was! The Huskers (Bob Mould-guitar,voc., Grant Hart-drums,voc., Greg Norton-bass,voc.) are presented here in their final tour at the peak of their powers. From the opening power-mantra of 'New Day Rising"" to the three & a half minute visceral rush of ""Standing in the Rain"" to the frantic, un-hinged renderings of ""Friend, Your Gonna Fall"" & ""Devide and Conquer"", the band's intensity never falters. The album closer, a rabid cover of the Ramone's ""Sheena is a Punk Rocker"" actually approaches the intensity of ""da brudda's"" original!"
3,Adequate,"Not great, but not bad either. I needed to take apart my dash, it worked for that....Haven't used it since."
5,Great product,This product is very useful to me and it will be to you too. You will have no regrets if you buy this product because it will pretect your hands if theu get smashed by a stick or if they are smashed by a ball. This product really works!!
3,"Okay, but not the best","I was overjoyed when I discovered this album. I couldn't believe that a CD could have all of these hits for $5.37! Here's what I didn't notice: none of the songs are sung by the original artists. Not all of the singers on the album are talented either. It's definitely not a high-quality piece of work, but what else can you expect for $5.37?"
3,Fun oddball game,"I purchased this because I enjoy quirky japanese titles. There are a few levels that irked me, due to a sudden spike in the difficulty level. All-in-all, it was a C+ game. That said, if you are not a fan of randomness, you will give it an F."
4,Fans of the first will love it!,It Great. More mini games more than the first One thing is that they come one after another instead of you picking three or two at a time. ??You have the option to skip one scene in the game.The games are story driven. which I thought was cool.There are also more extras after the game this time around. Definately an improvement among the original.
4,Good sequel,"As good as sequels go, this is a good one. An interesting set of mixed games to add to the original game ""Feel the Magic""."
4,deliciously salacious!,"My wife read me parts of this book while we were driving on a long trip. I found it very entertaining and well written, and am surprised that it is out of print already. One may not agree with her opinions and lifestyle, but she's had an interesting life doing it HER way, and is one helluva good writer."
4,Shelley had quite a life,"Quite an interesting autobiography, not like any ive ever read. I just picked it up at the thrift store, what the heck. It was only $.20. She was quite promiscuous, though i must say, coming from a different lifestly and point-of-view on things, she was very casual about her acqauntances. Maybe im just old-fashioned, but i thought most of it was repelling. But interesting life, nonetheless."
4,Acoustic Power is worth it all,"Power in the Blood is my least favorite album by this band. Having grown up in the south and in a gospel church most of my life, I loved the fusion of music styles on the first two albums. Power, is more of a pure house flavor, and Im not a big fan of house. Alas, I am an Alabama 3 fan and I have both the 1 CD England version and the US 'A3"" 2CD album of Power, that has the 2ed CD Acoustic Power. It was worth it for these cool country flavored tunes from their albums.Id do it again."
3,"Not their best, but still pretty good.","One of Alabama3's lesser works, in my opinion. It lacks the really hard driving beat of its predecessors, but nevertheless, not bad. Be prepared for some left-wing lyrics, though."
2,shipping is expensive,Better off buying at the store. Being a Prime member did not get me free shipping.
4,Product as advertised,"This product was exactly as advertised. Took a couple days longer to receive it than I had planned on, but the product is definitely a good one."
3,One little problem....,"I quit smoking 6 months ago with chantix and these toothpicks. I quit the Chantix a couple months in but have been using the toothpicks ever since. Also have been getting nausea a lot lately. After looking into lots of different ideas, I googled tea tree oil.....every site warns you not to take internally. It can be highly toxic even in small doses. So while it did help quitting smoking, I'm switching over to the minty toothpicks you get in restaurants."
4,Helps for Smoking Cessation,"I have quit smoking recently, and I was a menthol smoker. I've been trying to find something to occupy me in the car, which seems to be my biggest 'trigger'. I found these on Amazon and thought, why not try it? Well, they have worked great. They are actually so overpowering that it is distracting to me. I don't particularly like the taste, but I am someone who does not like mint, peppermint, spearmint, gum, etc. I think if you like those flavors, you will like this taste. I saw there is a cinnamon, but since I'm replacing a menthol cigarette addiction, I think this is helping me just fine. I even 'inhale' on the tooth pick sometimes. Hah, I know it's crazy, but it works."
2,These are toothpicks...,"So these are regular old toothpicks that have been soaked in tea tree oil and a bit of Cinnamon Oil (those are the only two I can taste); also according to the package- canola oil, peppermint oil, spearmint oil, and fennel oil. I guess I expected them to be larger or otherwise different because the are called ""chewing sticks"". I expected wrongly.In my experience, these do not appear to splinter any less than ""normal"" toothpicks. I picked up a normal toothpick at a restaurant today (shaped just like these with one pointed end and one flat w/ embellishments) and it was of the same durability, just without the various oils taste.I am not going to throw these away, but now I wished I would have bought plastic toothpicks for durability's sake or bought just normal toothpicks for the cost savings. I do like the little plastic pack they come in; that is handy.Purpose of purchase was to give me something else to gnaw on besides my own fingers/fingernails."
5,Tea Tree Chew Sticks,"So I got these in September and I chew them on a regular basis, let me just say this: They are fantastic! I am an avid chewer of things, it gives me something to focus on when I'm bored out of my skull. I used to chew on paper or regular toothpicks for the most part, sometimes I'd just chew plain gum or go and get some candy. Well these eliminate that for me. And I feel like my breath is fresher and my mouth just feels pleasantly clean all the time. I've noticed none of the nausea that another reviewer mentioned, and the amount of tea tree in these is negligible at best unless you're very sensitive to the effects. The birchwood is soft enough so that it doesn't hurt my teeth if I'm gnawing it to mush, something I couldn't do with pen caps or chewing gum. I just love these sticks. I think my next purchase will be the cinnamon ones, though I did see a reviewer saying that they are a bit strong.Great purchase!"
3,Not as good as other options,"I just ordered some of these Thursday Plantation toothpicks from Amazon. Several reviews state they are strong. Perhaps there is some variation in the manufacturing but I consider them to be quite mild. My perference is the toothpicks from Tea Tree Thereapy Inc. that are labeled: ""Tea Tree Thereapy - Tea Tree Toothpicks"". Those have quite a bit more punch than the Thursday Plantation offering. One item to note is that these toothpicks seem to be a bit more durable tan the Tea Tree Therapy ones so that is a plus for this brand. Again this is likely due to variation in the natural materials used. Happy toothpicking!"
2,"High quality tooth picks, but overpowering flavor","These tooth picks are definitely high quality and can take some major punishment. I've been chewing one for over an hour now and it's still sturdy, but the flavor is terrible in my opinion. It's very strong and it feels like the equivalent of pouring tea tree oil into my mouth. I regret not getting the cinnamon flavor. I got these because I figured the tea tree oil might be better for my teeth and gums, which might not even be true. So unless you really like the taste of tea tree oil already there's a good chance you won't like the taste. I'm hoping maybe after a while I'll just get used to it and maybe even enjoy it."
3,It's okay,"I switched to cinnamon picks, because these too me taste kinda gross. You're breath is kinda funky too afterwards. But it gives you a kick."
3,A Little Scattered But Interesting In Spots,"The Primal Cheeseburger attempts to delve into the history of basic food groups while utilizing the supposed All American Cheeseburger, Fries, and Coke meal as a guideline. There are certainly some interesting historical notes on how meat became an integral part of certain cultures meals. Some good discussions on the origins of bread, cheese, etc.However, this book tries to cover way too much ground. Some of the changes in the authors subject matter are introduced a bit too abruptly. Perhaps the author could have organized this book so it flowed better and covered a few things well instead of many things haphazzardly.Nonetheless, this brief history of food around the world has its moments."
5,a great read by a good friend.,very well written by a deliberate and sensitive scholar. it's much like our conversations. a definite must for any library.
2,Disappointing,"This movie should/could have been great if it had more action. There is maybe a total of 10 minutes of real action. The rest of the time is used for a convoluted story full of characters I never found any reason to care about. This particular style of hand-drawn animation does not blend well with the CG animation. Overall, a very disappointing offering from acclaimed director Mamoru Oshii."
3,"Its okay, just not really my cup of tea.","I bought this movie cause it was based from the Wii game, The Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces. The story seems to take place after the game but I not gonna spoil what happens in the movie."
2,Plot Crawlers,"Sky Crawlers has some interesting Dog Fights and imagery, but little else interesting.Chris"
1,More like Cancer Crawlers,"There is really not much to say except that this a drawn out cartoon with extremely lackluster animation. The look, story, and pacing are slow and sloppy. There is 5 to 8 minutes of passable entertainment while the rest is sadly filler. This is time I cannot get back in my life. There is a huge emphasis on smoking cigarettes which comes off as ""Why""? Why is that all of the technical features such as aircraft, vehicles, and military installations all look sophisticated and top notch and then all of the characters look really crappy? It looks like lazy drawing. I think it is safe to say that these anime films are for populations that are starved for any type of entertainment."
1,Slow and Boring..,"Oshii, he specialized in slow movies and obsessive on his passion for the dogs. The movie is a circle without an ending and does not develop. The character is very traumatic and the only way to survivor is fight against peace, a peace that will never come. A rival plane who's impossible to destroy and at the end he will destroy any one who come across his way. The movie did not really impress me; this is ""Oshii styled"", slow and boring. This movie is nothing like Ghost in the Shell's. The plot does not save the movie at all! I also don't like the design of the characters. I prefer the characters design from the Ghost in the Shell and Jin Roh, Hiroyuki Okiura."
1,Sky Crawlers,"I was so dissapointed in this dull, veeeeery slow moving movie. It really did not make any sense. I wanted to return it. Now that I think about it; it does not deserve ""One Star""."
4,"Beautiful, if a little strange","I love animation, and Sky Crawlers is another good addition to my collection. My only problem with it was that the parameters of the world were never explained. It takes place in, what looks like Italy, with an American diner down the street, and Japanese people being at the air base. The characters, I think, fight for the entertainment of the rest of the world? It's a little confusing. The relationships between the characters, who they are, and where they come from is explained completely. The reasons they fight, however, are quite vague.If you don't mind your animation being a little surreal, then it's a wonderful animated film. Absolutely the best dogfighting film in animation. If you like fighter planes in animation, then this film is a must have. They get the feel and motion of a dogfighting experience completely accurately in this film."
5,Stunning. Must own!,I ordered the Blu-Ray version of this. I watched it the same night I recieve it. Knowing that the director was the same person who did Ghost in the Shell. I had high hopes. The movie didn't let me down one bit. The animation is terrific. The story for me started out little slow. But it did pick up. This anime is wonderful. Must get. You have to see this movie.
3,review,"Please, the best song on the soundtrack was ""(So I'll Sit Here) Waiting"" by the Like. Katy rose is overrated."
3,..,"Okay, okay. i saw the movie; great.i wanna buy the soundtrack but first i gotta say, katy rose rocks! i love the song lemon! :D ..cuz i got her cd! *does sad disco groove*"
4,A great soundtrack and an amazing movie/story.,All of these songs completely fit the story of thirteen. It was put together well!
3,HELP!!,"hey everyone, first of all wanna say that i loved the movie and loved all the music on it BUT i reallllly need to find out wat that music is that's playing when tracey says ""i can't even remember how to spell photographer"" and it also plays towards the end when tracey and mel are sleeping in her bed after the huge scene between them and evie and brooke. PLEASE someone help me im desperate to get this music on my ipod...THANKS!! im so annoyed that this isnt on the soundtrack as i feel, and im sure many others feel aswell, that it is the most important score in the movie, playing in the serious scenes that eveyone remembers and thinks ""hey wasnt that music in that scene GREAT?"" its really bugging me i can't find it ANYWHERE thanks"
5,Danglies,"I always wear leverbacks. I wanted something in silver and a little more visible than what I usually wear. These are great -- swingy, not too heavy, and beautiful with my new spring greys and whites."
5,above the clouds en route to heaven!,"this maxi single is the definitive club single ! all of the remixes are gr8, but.. the best one is the sal dano and brian k. hard dub (#8)...you must listen to this..as revieweed further down this page, it mixes orchestral sections and techno beats through the ""dub""...it's unlike any dub i've ever heard! get this maxi single !"
3,Did you notice a curiousity?,On the picture of the CD record on this site it says: Producer Sidney Liebowitz.This is Steve Lawrence' original birth name according to Wikipedia!Since I haven't heard the CD my rating doesn't mean anything.
3,Nothing to go crazy over,This is a simple film. Not really any thinking involved here. Not a bad film eithor. Don't get me wrong it's good but it just doesn't have the feel of some of his other films.
2,Disappointed,"I did some comparisons for wired phones. Phone is just average, however I was disappointed that it did not have a lighted caller ID window. It's very hard to see anything in the window."
2,Runs on batteries??,"It's an inexpensive phone, so the cheap feel to it is to be expected.I was surprised to see that it took batteries. A corded desk phone? It turns out that the phone simply doesn't work at all without the batteries. And a set of 4 new AA batteries lasted only three days before expiring, making the phone worthless.It really should come with an AC power supply, but I don't understand why they can't run it off the power supplied in the phone line."
2,Disappointed with speaker,I am very disappointed with the speakerphone portion. The only reason I bought this was for the speakerphone.The persons voice on the other end fades in an out constantly. I had assumed it was noise/feedback on my end. But it does the same thing with mute on.Will have to return and try a different model/brand.
1,two things,"I have two major problems with this device. First of all it eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so it is inconvenient and expensive to operate. If the batteries die, which they do frequently, you lose your call display feature and the speakerphone won't work. It eats four AA batteries at a time.Secondly, as noted by reviewers of similar AT&T; speakerphone models, after about two years the call display starts to fail. The pixels stop working so when you get a call you see dots and line fragments instead of a recognizable name and phone number.When I buy a phone I expect it to last more than two years."
1,Avoid this phone!,"I have purchased quite a number of these phones for my office (mainly because they were priced right and could be purchased at our local Staples conveniently). However, without exception, the LCD displays would fail between 12 and 18 months after purchasing. We literally had a graveyard of these phones before I finally decided to never purchase another one. Oh, and AT&T customer service was absolutely no help. Even though other features are OK, do not buy this phone unless you enjoy replacing it every year or so."
4,"AT&T 950 Corded Telephone with Caller Id, Call Waiting and Speakerphone",Great corded phone with all the features I was looking for. Good value for my money.
3,Disappointed - Not original artists,"This CD has a lot of great love songs, but they aren't sung by the original artists like Bette Midler, Peter Cetera, Roxette, etc. Sing alikes are okay but I prefer the original ones who sang the songs and made them popular in the first place."
5,Great Debut Book-Recommended Read,"I read this book in less than two days, and thoroughly enjoy it. The previous reviewer was totally in left field,but she has a right to express her opinion. The subject of ""absentee fathers"" were explored through the voices of his sons, and I definitely felt the anger and bitterness from Terrance and Malik, and the grieving from Sammie. WOW! I could literally picture the surroundings of the projects that Sammie was forced to live in with his crazy a** aunt, Crystal. The pages kept turning for me, and i will definitely tell my friends to run and get this book ""Sins of the Father"". Felicia put me on your mailing list, I eagerly await your next novel....Urban Books definitely have a winner in this talented writer."
1,A Waste of Money,"These goblets were purchased to add to a picnic basket that I was giving as a gift. The clear plastic goblets arrived with the packaging intact, yet all of the goblets were cloudy with deep scratches and abrasions. Three of the four had messy glue joints where the stems attach to the goblet and the fourth one was not glued together at all!. In disgust, I discarded them altogether and purchased a package of inexpensive disposable wine glasses at a local party supply store. Though thinner and lighter in weight than the Keep it Simple With Katie Brown Goblets, the party store glasses looked better and cost far less!"
1,This author is a loser,"Look I just purchased the book ""Web Page Collection"" by this author, it is ""Visual Quick Project"" Nothing works, the links given do not work, the instructions are NOT correct and the book is a waste. No address was given to write directly to the author so this my best way to say I would not buy another book by the author."
2,"Errors, Lots and Lots of Errors","37 errors are listed on the author's site. I think I found some new ones as well. The material moves from the specific to general, so that the reader must skip around quite a bit. The aforementioned errors make learning XML very tedious and frustrating. An edit should have done - it is apparent none was. I have used Castro's books in the past and have never experienced the problems I have with this one. I recommend against purchasing this book and I hope Peachpit will not repeat the problems encountered within."
3,"Good overall XML review, but it has gaps","This book does cram a whole lot of information into a tiny space. I will say that, if you are interested in getting started with XML, the book tries to include all the ""pieces"" you need - like not just XML code, but DTDs and XSLT, etc.However, the section on XSLT is seriously lacking. I worked on trying to make a VERY BASIC stylesheet yesterday and have yet to get one working. (I'm not new to programming either.) The book gives a lot of ""do this, do that"" examples, but without explaining the concepts of XSLT more completely and logically, it doesn't really equip you to go out and write stylesheets yourself. I'm disappointed."
3,Editor needed,"Admittedly, I'm only up to the second chapter in this book, but it's clear that Castro needed a better editor. She relies on a frustrating ""Type this, then we'll come back to it later"" approach (example: naming your DTD, then finding out four pages later HOW to apply that information). Disappointing as her XHTML + CSS and Flash MX books were much tighter in execution."
1,not worth your time,"Money is OK.... :)This is a book written by and for HTML coders. It doesn't teach the gist of XML or guide you to do anything that really needs XML. On the other hand, if you just want to understand some basics of XML (instead of DOING real things), I think it is better to find a review paper on XML instead, which will save you time and get the point easier. This author wrote a wonderful HTML book, but this XML one looks like a piggyback on the reputation earned there - may ruin it."
5,Well-written with lots of good info,I'm pretty picky about computer books because I write computer books myself. I'm always really happy then when I read a computer book that's more than just regurgitated documentation and when the author does an extra fine job at discussing and explaining some technology. That's the case with Castro's book. She does a great job. It's easy to read. And a profitable use of the reader's time. This is a perfect introduction to XML.
4,Good XML Introduction,"Like Ms Castro's HTML Quick Start Guide, this book offers an excellent introduction to XML, concise and descriptive text on the left side of each page and code examples on the right. This makes it easy to understand and learn the concepts being discussed.Castro describes the ""nuts and bolts"" of XML, discussing first how to write an XML document, and then creating a Document Type Definition (DTD), essential for any XML document. Subsequent chapters describe elements, attributes, values, entities, and namespaces in XML documents. As with the HTML Quick-Start guide, there are coded examples to guide you through each step and topic discussed.While full browser support for XML still seems a ways off, its potential overshadows any questions anyone may have about it. It's still well worth knowing and Castro makes learning about XML quite easy."
1,Not For Beginners! Jumbled Mess!,"While I can't say this is the worst XML book I've ever read, it's definitely not the best either. I've worked with and learned some xml in college, and I can definitely tell you that this book is full of vague descriptions. I learned alot more from tizag.coms XML tutorials than I did reading this crap. The author goes as far as to explain how to create the structure of a xml document for several pages before explaining how to even write the xml declaration. Pitiful. A beginner would never understand this book at all. I do not recommend this book."
2,Not a stand-alone book,"I've read through 2/3 of the book for an XML class. This book did not provide a good picture of what could be accomplished with XML. Nor did it explain steps well. I found myself getting very confused in many places and wondering why the author did what they did.While the steps are succinct, you do need other resources to learn XML. I was very frustrated with the book."
3,mostly syntax and little semantics,The author spends almost the entire book typing out the syntax of the various statements and seems to lack in conveying an over all structure or framework in which to better understand XML. After the 1st few chapters the book becomes very repeative in it's approach.
