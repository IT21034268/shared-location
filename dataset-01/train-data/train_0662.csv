4,Stablemates Little Red Barn,I apsolutely loved my barn when I was a little girl. It was hard to put together and that meant to me that it wasn't going to fall apart. I loved the fact that it comes with two Stablemates! I hope that someone will have a lot of fun with beautiful collectors item/toy!
2,handle with care,"my daughter received this for christmas two year ago. the pieces pop apart easily and the plastic becomes warped with continued use. the barn doors lost their ""nubs"" to stay attached within about 2 weeks. not for frequent use! now shopping for a more durable model."
1,too small. Poorly made,"What a disappointment. My daughter is three. She is in love with horses and wanted a home for them at Christmas.I grew up playing with Breyer Horses. She is playing with the ones I played with. This stable that I bought is too small for even her hands to use. The roof doesn't attach properly and once the roof is on the stable is inaccessible.Throughly disappointed in this product, save your money. Not worth a penny."
1,"Good for collectors, not for children!","Don't buy this if you expect it to actually stay assembled!I bought this for my horse-crazed daughter when she was 4. She is not overly rough with her toys at all, but every time she tried to play with this thing the roof fell off. And then some of the doors would. And forget keeping the little chimney on without some super glue. My husband and I both put it together several times, and my husband can rebuild motors for pete's sake! We're not clueless people by a long shot when it comes to assembling things, but this stable frustrated us both beyond belief. The pieces absolutely would not stay snapped in correctly, no matter what we did!I had planned to try and glue it together, but instead decided to junk this to the recycle bin because I've already wasted enough time on it. My daughter is receiving a Melissa and Doug wooden stable for x-mas next week."
5,Wonderful !!!,"Anya Seton has written 2 of my all time favorite books: Katherine and Green Darkness. I have read and re-read these two books quite a few times. Katherine is not just a romantic story, it catches you up into the times the story is set. A great escape from daily grind."
4,A few raised eyebrows....,"I don't generally label myself a romance reader, but this work of historical fiction was definately worth the read. There were I few instances where I felt the independent woman theme wasn't realistic for the times, but I overlooked that and just settled back for an enjoyable and engrossing read."
2,I Think It Must Be Me,"I think it must be me...Perhaps I'm suffering from some rare and unknown disease or disorder where I don't know what a good book is when I read it? All of my 'friends' loved this book and gave it high marks.I thought that it was dull. I'm glad that Seton wrote it, it is interesting for it's historical value, a record of the life of Katherine Swynford.But the characters did not come to life for me. The exciting events were brief and the boring parts were SO long. I don't feel like I have any more than a slight understanding of the politics during this period after reading this book. I would have liked an historical note from the author indicating what facts she incorporated into the story and what she fabricated.I will look for something different on Katherine Swynford's life."
5,A wonderful book,"Katherine was one of my earliest and most -loved reads. The story is so well told and the characterisation is amazing. One follows Katherine through her amazingly interesting life and honestly loves her at every turn.I can give it no greater compliment then to tell you all, that when my only daughter was born I named her ""Kathryn"" in honour of this woman that Anya Seton bought to life so well.A tremendous read."
3,Good example of early historical romance,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this book, I just don't care for historical romances, and life is too short to read books you don't enjoy, right?If you are looking for an example of early books in this genre, this book is a great one to start with. The story is about Katherine Swynford and her long time relationship and eventual marriage to John of Gaunt (father of Henry IV, grandfather to Henry V). Geoffrey Chaucer plays a small role in the story; he was brother-in-law to Katherine.I made it 3/5 of the way through the book, but there was someone waiting at the library for it, so I did the honorable thing ... and returned it on time. :-)"
2,I was so bored I almost gave up,"This is the first book that I almost gave up on before I finished reading it. Halfway through the book it just became COMPLETELY boring. I literally forced myself to continue reading. It did get better, and I was pretty happy with the ending. Still, there was a chapter or two that was completely unreadable. I bought this book because it takes place in my favorite time period in history and it had such good reviews, but I found it wasn't really all that others claim it is. Judge for yourself, but I will never read this book again. That's for sure."
3,One of the better pieces of historical fiction,"Although this is not ""Great Literature"", it is at least a decent bit of writing based on the lives of actual historical figures and a fair overview of late fourteenth century English history. Learning a bit of history never hurt anyone, even if she/he is reading this just for the romance angle. Accompanying a friend who happens to be intrigued by Katherine Swynford via this book, I have visited her tomb, have seen Kettlethorpe (the home of her first marriage) and also the house believed to be her Lincoln residence. I found the book a bit too lengthy, and not a real page turner, but at least made it to the end."
2,What is the big deal?,I don't get it. All the 5 star reviews I mean. This is a very nice story very poorly told. It drones on and on with excrutiating detail.I have read better.
2,Very disappointing,"I ordered Katherine because I absolutely loved Green Darkness by this author. I can only say that it reads very much like any other ""romance"" novel put out by the thousands on a daily basis."
1,Too old,Don't waste your time on this one unless you're familiar with the dialect. Very hard to understand due to the time it was written. The reviews are good but I just don't see how in this day and age.
5,My All-time Favorite,"""Katherine"" is my all-time favorite book. Not only is the story an inspiration, the history is rich with detail and you learn a lot from reading it. I have probably read it 6 times over, and am ready to do so again. I also wish the Savoy was still standing! I have yet to make it to England from my home in the United States, but it is my dream to go someday and see all these places for myself. If you want to be transported, read this book (again and again)."
5,It stays with you for years,I read Katherine eight years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. I finally decided to buy it because I want it in my library so that I can read it every few years. I won't summarize the book (that has already been done) but I will say that if you want to read a gripping historical romance set in Plantagenet England (I learned a lot) then read this book!
4,Wonderful Historical Novel,"When I was 13, I had no use for history - just a boring bunch of meaningless facts and dates. Then I read this book. I recently got my MA in history all thanks to this book. When I read Chaucer, I thought of how he was portrayed (He was Katherine's brother-in-law). I grasped English history and Shakespear's plays because John of Gaunt as portrayed by Anya Seton was my touchstone for the history of the period. Of course, my liking for history began with loving the book. I read it several times. Looking back, some of the attitudes are dated; I can pick out little flaws, but why bother? This is a wonderful book to make the middle ages come alive plus the romance is incredible because it's a true story! It's a story no fiction writer would dare to invent!"
5,A GREAT READ,"I first read this novel in the early 70's while in college and was enthralled with it then, as much as now. I just re-read it, and again, the love story and the historical background are rich in detail and full of enjoyment. Now, I've been inspired by this to read more historical fiction. Thanks to the reviewers here online, I've gotten many good ideas on my ""list"" of books to read."
4,The Enquirer of the Middle Ages,"This is a fantastic story of the birth of the Tudor family. It is also a story that truly tells how love conquers all.I was unable to put this book down! It is a mix of a heroine that you love, pity and are sickened with due to her own wants and desires. It is a wonderful story about how we can all lie to ourselves when what we want is morally wrong and what can happen as a result."
3,"I enjoyed it, but it didn't slay me","I enjoyed reading it and the references to history, but I didn't find it compelling and had a hard time getting into it. I must preferred the Outlander series for historical fiction. This was good, but by the end I was bored and skimming to ""get to the point."""
2,PUBLISHING ISSUES,"The first point to make is that this is a wonderful historical novel. That said, the Kindle version has clearly been transcribed by some form of computer program and is full of errors. It spoils the novel. This is not some free e publishing book, it costs nearly $10. The publishers should be ashamed to charge so much for something into which they have put so little care and attention."
5,Wonderful,"What a perfect story told by a wonderfully talented writer. This isn't your modern day romance novel, far better then any that you will get these days. (OK maybe Diana Gabaldon.) Katherine, stands one of the few fine stories told, that made me sob out loud, and feel Katherine and John's pain and joy. What love that stands the test of time. This is the first Anya Seton novel I have read, and am looking for her others."
2,Too much like a romance novel,I have to agree with the other two star reviews. There are some interesting historical happenings but it reads too much like a romance novel whose characters are very shallow.
4,"Romance, oh my!","This book is a truly lovely romantic historical novel. It explains events as they would be expected to happen, from a young nothing girl in love with a man who saves her but sees nothing past her girlishness, to a single night where love finally finds the man, to a woman taking pleasure in her disgrace with the love of a man, and finishing with the two lovers finally allowing themselves the life they really wanted. Seton does not write a story of lovers that survive despite the rules. Instead it a story of two people who eventually come to love each other and try to live within the confinments of their society. It gives you a wonderful overview of the historical happenings during the time through a love story that spands decades."
3,Too much tangential information,"I purchased this book based on all the previous reviews. Although Katherine's journey was interesting, I found the writing to be tiresome midway through the book. There was too much extending information which distracted me from the scenes and stories set by the author. By the end, I was praying for some horrible death to befall Katherine or her precious Duke just so the novel would end and I could donate the book to my local library. This was not a 5 - star read for me."
5,Katherine by Anya Seton,"I woud like to let you all know that this book was not written by Philippa gregory but by Any Seton. I read this book more than 30 years ago with all the other books of Anya Seton. this one is my favorite. It is a beautiful love story at the same time the description of the period and the historical research is very close to accuracy.I hope you will reset the title and the Author, Ms gregory has most probably written a preface to this book.thank you for your attention in this matter.Icihiboo"
4,Allure of Katherine,"Anya Seton's Katherine is a fantastic, mamouth piece of literature. Seton writes of a love that spans the ages and the reader can still feel the illicit quality alive today. The book I bought was not the one I thought I was purchasing (it was a older version, overpriced and lacking the forward by Phillipa Gregory) but still- the book outwieghed the missing forward by one of my favorite authors. I would seriously recommend this book for anyone who can sit through English politics in detail of the 1300's."
2,Plodding and Flat,"Many people adored this book, as evidenced by all the 5 star reviews, but I was not one of them. It took a real effort of will to trudge through this drawn-out emotionally dry and dusty tale. The writing style reads very much like a romance novel from the 1950's or 60's with characters who seem over-simplified and shallow, rather like how you might tell a story to a small child (except for excruciating detail in just about every other way- down to what each and every serf and shepherd are wearing). I never really understood what drew Katherine and John together because they aren't written as especially engaging or likable characters. They are both good-looking. And he is rich. And she is pious. So if that's what appeals to you in a novel, this may be something that sets your heart on fire. If you are hoping for more, look elsewhere."
4,"Katherine, revisited","This is the book that sparked my life long love of historical fiction of British history. It was great to read it again, but the e version has typographical errors, one or more every chapter. It is disappointing to pay this much for a book and have mistakes in it that disrupt the flow of the story."
5,Started my love affair with the Tudors,"I am like many of the readers here. Found this in paperback at the flea market in the 60s and it changed the way I viewed history forever. I wore out my paperback and had to search for a hardcover volume.Alison Weir's MISTRESS OF THE MONARCHY is worth the read as a companion to KATHERINE, which remains a beloved book after all these years.Also highly recommended are Green Darkness and The Winthrop Woman."
4,Lovely romance with details of Court Life,"I so enjoy a good historical fiction. While I agree at times this story seemed to drone a bit, it has some unexpected twists and turns. The number of characters keeps you on your toes and not all goes as you would suspect.The pull between John and Katherine made my heart happy. I wanted them to be happy. And given the ending met my expectations it was all good."
5,LOOOOVED IT!,"This is an excellent book! Each scene comes lushly alive. You will see, hear, smell, and feel each page. This is the extraordinary story of Katherine Swynford--a poor commoner that bewitched the greatest noble of her time (John of Gaunt). A must-read."
5,"If you love history and romance, this is a great book","I love this book, it is full of English history, romance and a wonderful story. A wonderful non fiction book that will grab the reader from the first page."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"Being a fan of Phillipa Gregory I always look for more historical fiction to enjoy and Katherine exceeded my expectations. I was surprised it was written quite a while ago. I found it to be well researched and written, and it read smooth and moved at a nice pace. I'm now hooked on Anya Seton and look forward to reading more of her works. This is a fabulous book for a vacation because it's hard to put it down. It's a great romance in an even greater story. Please don't hesitate to grab this one and enjoy it."
3,I would often get...,"very aggravated by the back and forth, wishy washy, character of Katherine and them some factual MEAT would be thrown in and I would become interested again... and then back to the silly. I wanted more character development. She, they (John) seemed so surface shallow. I'd rather have had less of a range in scope and more depth to the characters."
5,Excellent Read!,I first read this years ago - and wasn't disappointed this time.Engrossing and historically accurate. This is truly a timeless book.
5,Awesome Historical Romance,"I bought this book based off of the recommended list of an Amazon.com user, and I do not regret it. This book is delightful. I feel it accurately portrays the day-to-day life of the time period, as well as a wonderful interpretation of this historical love story. The trials and sorrows of Katherine provides a wonderful story you can escape in."
3,different book than advertised but i'm still happy to have it,this book as advertised should be red covered with the genenology on the inside flap but i got a green covered book with no genenology. i was very disapointed but happy to have obtained a copy of a hard back that i am not eager to complain. just thought the seller should know since they had one other for sell too.
5,It was a wonderful book as a teenager and it still is now!,"Like many of your other reader-reviewers, I read Katherine when I was a teenager - I was transported to a by-gone world and suddenly my history lessons came alive. What a wonderful experience (and what a great way to learn about history). Katherine is an exceptional novel - far more involved than your usual ""romance"" novels. I can only hope that Ms. Seton's publisher continues to print all of her books for a long, long time!!"
5,I can't believe it is over!!,"I just finished this book and am so sad that it is over. Does anyone else know where to find more information on Katherine or John of Gaunt? Or any other good reads that focus around the same time period? I bought this book because I loved ""The Other Bolyn Girl"", and was not disappointed. I love books that are based on true stories and recommend this a thousand times over!"
4,"one of the first, and still one of the best!","This book may have been written in the 1950's, but the story is timeless, and the storyteller is quite skilled in her craft. The dilemmas that Katherine faced were daunting, and the author does not spare us any details in an attempt to make Katherine more sympathetic. I can understand why many historical fiction writers cite Seton as a role model. This is definitely more than a romance novel!Many of the historical inaccuracies are minor, and are because in the 1950's, there was significantly less known about Medieval Europe than there is now. I am sure that if Seton were to write the book today, she would get those facts straight. But the basic premise holds true, regardless. Peg"
4,A poetic epic.,"This is a lush and beautifully rendered book. The language is dense and evocative without seeming stilted, and the story is wonderfully engaging and full of all the things a good epic should have: romance, betrayal, death, war, tragedy, and redemption.Oh, and a cast of thousands. But most readers won't have a problem keeping the characters straight.My only complaint is that the omniscient POV often changes from charater to character quite rapidly, even within the course of a paragraph or two.-- ""head hopping,"" as they say. It was a little distracting at times. Otherwise, a delicious read."
4,TOUGH PROGRESSIVE BREAKS...,"WOW....HYBRID IS A GROUNDBREAKING GROUP THAT IS CONSTANTLY THINKING FORWARD....THIS SINGLE IS NO EXCEPTION, WITH EXTREMEMLY TIGHT DRUMS AND BEAUTIFUL GUITAR RIFFS PROCESSED THROUGH FILTERS AND PLUG-INS...EXCELLENT VOCALS...THE JOHN CREAMER AND STEPHANE K REMIX IS A BIT BORING...A NICE SET OPENER, BUT NOTHING MORE..."
5,Product review,The product was amazing and I really am enjoying this wonderful album. I have been wanting King Floyd for a very long time.
3,Sharod'g review,I think the CD is okay. It wasn't totally what I expected. I was looking for more material from Standard. But I loved Witness' sound growing up. Great job Michael Brooks. Hope there's a reunion project soon.Sharod from Chicago
3,"not bad, but don't rely on it for everything","This is a guide in the perfect size for airline reading. However, it spends WAY too much time on lodging and restaurants while neglecting information on what to do in Phoenix. I was particularly disappointed in the limited amount of information on golf courses in the area. I was also disappointed in the lack of information on spring training basesball. The book also is short on maps of the area.The book's strong points include excellent information on every resort in the Valley of the Sun. The restaurant section is extensive. However, restaurants change so frequently and you will find many of the mentioned places have already closed.This is a book worth buying at the Amazon.com price. I would recommend a companion guide if you're interested in golf or other activities in Phoenix."
3,Missing My Finance Lab,"If you are getting this book for a class, you will need My Finance Lab software. This book does not come with an access code for the software so I had to go and buy it separately. I thought I was getting a good deal, but now will end up paying more."
2,Does not come with My Finance Lab Access Code,"I ordered the book but the book does not include the MyFinanceLab Access Code to get to the online study guide and self tests. I thought I may have gotten a defective book but I sent the book back and the replacement book also lacked a MyFinanceLab Access Code that I needed for my class. If you purchase it online, I hear that it is $40.00."
3,Look up,Well i found it an interesting book but the thing is that it should also be in eastern economy eddition also.
1,Piece of Junk,"Don't buy Akai! It worked great and we were more than pleased when we first got it. But after just a few months the DVD player started going out and completely died. OK, so we got an external DVD player not the end of the world and that went good for a short time. Now the TV won't turn on! After only two years this thing is completely as dead as a door nail. Stay away from Akai. Just google Akai TV problems and you will see how chronic their reliabilty issues are. I wager that a lot of people on here who gave it great reviews are either now pissed (or shortly will be) about how their TVs have died very far before what their life expecancy should be."
2,"Ok, but dying after only 3 years","I have had this tv for 3 years now and its on its last leg. The picture quality is good but other things are going out on it. The remote will not turn on the tv now, you have to turn off the main power button the turn it back on then push the side power button for it to come on. Then you have to wait for several minutes before you can adjust the volume. Also the screen is getting dark swirls on the left side. If I were to do it again I would not get this TV.The Dvd player is not a very good one, I use another player and dont us the built in one very much at all. Picture quality is good, except for the black swirles. Sound is bad, so use different speakers.This set is ready to die after only three years of use. What happened to the days where one could count on their TV to last between 10-20 years?"
4,"Real houserockin'and trash talkin' raw, raw blues!","This is the first of Poonanny's albums...and if you don't know who he is, you better go ask somebody. I love the blues houseparty feel to his cuts...and he's always got something to say about his love exploits....Warning! A little too raw fer the kids, in fact, it may be way to raw fer the wife, too...."
4,da bomb,This is one of my favorite movies! only problem was the center of the DVD cracked ... seemed a little cheaper than normal.
5,"By far, the best!!!","This is the best Shaw bros. film ever, and possibly the best kung-fu movie ever!!! One star for each venom!!!"
3,Not as good as expected,The first half of this movie is pretty boring but the second half was worth sitting through the first half to see. It was really good. I only gave it 3 stars cause I think it does not compare to Jet Li or Bruce Lee movies. For an old school movie this is pretty good though.
5,Absolute Masterpiece!,"Ordered this movie from amazon a couple years back. Well worth the investment. Simply magnificent fight scenes and characters, i am waiting for the update remake of this classic. I hope the RZA and Quentin T get together to make it a worth while movie!"
1,horrible bootleg piece of crap!!!!!,"Awful sound and picture. Do not buy, amazon should not sell this cheaply made bootleg copy. Even the widescreen is bad. Looks like someone copied it off of a vhs tape."
4,This Movie Rules!,"Right from the opening sequences when the 5 Venoms demonstrate their respective Kung-Fu styles, you will know that this movie rules! Along side with Enter the Dragon, this movie is the measuring stick for all Kung-Fu flicks to come. While I believe some things are lost in the translation, the story still remains classic and intriguing."
1,another bootleg,"Just another of the many illegal bootlegs sold on Amazon, no wonder legit DVD companies have trouble making it in today's world."
2,"plot is amazing, everything else is a disappointment","Like the title says, Ni kuang and chang cheh create a brilliant kung fu story for this film, and then theres some stunts and action scenes that are preatty cool, but thats it, the rest is a disappointment, the kung fu here is LOUSY & SLOW, it will probably put you to sleep. If youre a chang cheh fan or like a creative kung fu plot and are curiousto watch It, I suggest you rent it or get it for as cheap as possible, but for anyone else heres my opinion: DONT GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS MOVIE."
3,http://my.bww.com/phineshealthandwellness,"This movie is a true classic that has to be in your Kung-Fu library, not one of my favorites but a classic none the less, the fighting is first class and the plot is plausable as far as this genre goes, a must see."
2,Overrated,"The action is ok, but not as much as these reviews would have you believe. I own this but it is probably the last movie I would pick to watch in my collection. The fighting styles are used better in other movies. This may be the original but that doesn't make it a ""great"" movie."
2,whats the big deal?,This movie always comes up when people talk about kung fu movies.But it really isnt such a good movie like everyone says because there isnt much fighting in this movie just a lot of talk u really have to listen to eveything they say because it is so easily confusing and its hard to watch without falling asleep. The fight at the end was good but this movie to me really isnt a kungfu movie but a msytery I havent seen all the venoms films but Im sure that the others have to be better than this one. Im gonna just say that 5 deadly venoms (is bad)!
1,"Cliche ridden, ""worst of kung fu"" waste of time!","With all due respect to different tastes, I found Five Deadly Venoms lethally boring. I thought the dialog was trite and incoherent, the humor lame and predictable, the martial arts stunts and display average to bad. The plot lack subtlety, imagination or surprise and although some of the sets and costumes looked authentic, I could not finish this loser. Perhaps it was better than bad when it first came out, but hard to watch after more recent kung fu fare."
1,i expected somwthing else,"This item had a lot of good ratings and so i decided to get it. It was portrayed as a great martial art film and a must for a collection. I watched the whole thing and waited for the martial art scenes to come. finally, at the end there was a good scene - but that was it. The sound was horible and so was the quality of the picture. This is a legend among Martial art lovers and as such you may want to get it - I would advise to leave it in the store."
4,Kung fu classic,A must own for any martial arts film fan great characters great action a shaw brothers classic reminds me of my youth watching Sunday afternoon Kung fu flicks
3,Not that great of a movie,"Original idea-maybe----execution-crappyFirst off I have this version and the picture quality is horrible and the sound is even worse. This has to be one of the lowest volume movies that I have ever experienced.Now that I got that off my chest, the kung fu in this movie is SUPERB, but it tries to be a mtstery and ultimatly fails.Side note on that last comment, even though the movie runs for about hour 45 minutes or so, it seems to have a lot of scenes cut out. This might have helped the story, then again it could have slowed it down even more.So overall a good movie on a dics that works and that's it."
5,Have You Seen RETURN OF THE 5 DEADLY VENOMS?,"I too used to watch this movie on saturday kung-fu theater (i had to have been 5 or 6 at the time). I could still remember the scene where two of the five are attcking SNAKE and one goes high the other goes low. That was some great s#!+If you've seen this flick, but haven't seen RETURN OF... then you are missing out.RETURN OF... right from the start grabs your attention and keeps it throughout. It begins with three men breaking into the home of one of their enemies to get revenge. He's not there, but his wife and son are. The three men kill his wife and cut his son's hands off. That's when daddy gets home and the story picks up... I don't want to spoil anything for you guys, but I'll say this: there's a pretty big twist right after the intro that you'll never expect (5 stars for this flick)"
3,A good movie spoiled by poor quality,"5 Deadly Venoms is a great movie with an absorbing story where you can see 5 guys using 5 different fighting techniques: the centipede, the snake, the scorpion, the lizard and the toad. I especially liked the snake style.Having said that, I must unfortunately comment on the poor quality of the DVD. It is the first time that I see dark violet bars instead of dark ones on a widescreen version of a film. And we can also see that the negative for the picture has quite aged over the years. A little restorating job would have been welcomed here.That the quality of the picture isn't top-notch can be forgiven, but the sound is so bad at times that I can't pass this one up. There are times in the movie when I have to crank up the volume real high to understand what the actors are saying.I hope (maybe in vain) that one day an important company gets the rights to the film and restore it to its just value. Until then..."
1,Venomously soporific,"The Five Venoms is something of a cult classic, though its hard to see why. There is very little martial arts action, and what there is is not all that spectacular. Most of the film is a plodding murder mystery that will have you reaching for the remote and the fast forward button - insipid dialog, bad acting, zero suspense, no location shooting, and cheesy special effects. Back in 1978 this may have been top-notch martial arts film-making, but in comparison to more recent efforts it holds up very poorly. For history buffs and nostalgia trippers only.#"
1,Beware the Five Deadly Boredoms!,"Look, I love martial arts movies. I appreciate that this is supposed to be a ""classic"".The first fight, such as it is, is at least 30 minutes into this tedious talkfest, and the next action of any note isn't for almost another hour.My kids, action-movie fans who are also blue belts, panned it.You may love this movie. Good for you. I'm just warning anybody who thinks this is going to be a fantastic action-fest... that it's not."
1,Good for its time,THis moive is just bad. The kung fu is bad. The acting is bad. The only good thing is the plot which is ok.
1,Soporifically venomous,"The Five Deadly Venoms is something of a cult classic, though its hard to see why. There is very little martial arts action, and what there is is not all that spectacular.

2,reading,I was disappointed as we could not watch the movie and get into it for having to read the things that they were saying. I do love the movie. We have it on tape and they were talking. IN ENGLISH. We did not have to read what they were saying.
4,"Good film, bad audio","This is a good movie, but the audio is lousy. I had to crank it up on my TV. Normally I watch TV at volume level 18. For this movie I had to crank it up to 60. The movie deserves 5 stars, but the lousy audio brings it down some."
4,great flick,Great movie to watch. Slightly slow at first in my opinion ends up showing well. A friend recommended the movie and I really like it. Four stars **** http://www.pbase.com/orangecones/car_shows
1,Didn't work,I gave it one star because the DVD didn't work in any of my players. I returned it the next day.
1,Brutal DVD,"This DVD is a huge ripoff. The video transfer obviously comes from a poor quality videotape. It is blurry and the sound is awful. This is worse than video releases than I've seen in the past. A major disappointment! Great movie, but wait for a better release!"
1,Sold out to the Hollywood he pretends to despise...,"This book is on such a lower level than his previous works it makes me wonder if it was ghost-written to keep a fan base, and a publisher off of Mr. Barker's back so that he may write, direct,or produce yet another wannabee hollywood B-movie. It used to be a very special thing indeed, I can remember meeting him once in Chicago at a book signing and remember thinking how that man sitting writer THERE, the dude with the leather jacket and the earing could have come up with the prose and imagination of Imajica. I am sad to say that that man is gone. Hopefully not for good.Get back to WRITING, Mr. B, we miss the hell out of ya."
2,"You've Changed, Man","As a long-time fan of Clive Barker's work, I have to say this book really disappointed me. The story is not so much ""A Hollywood Ghost Story"" as it is a touchy-feely expression of emotions......in a word, gay. I mean, I liked Galilee and Sacrament even though they were somewhat of a departure from his usual works, but this was too much. This story is sappy. This story is cliche. This book is admittedly based largely on Mr. Barker's homosexual lifestyle, and I just couldn't enjoy the so-called story that seemed to have taken a back-seat to pushing gays. If you're a fan of Hellraiser and Nightbreed and the Books of Blood, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Good Book!,"Good book. I hadn't read Barker in a few years, but this book was really good. I will gladly recommend this book."
2,"Barker - a great story-teller,but enough of the sex already!","Four areas that hit me the hardest...1. The reader's breathy performance was terribly distracting. I wont pick up another audio book read by him.2. Barker has a great way of putting emotional states into words.3. The long, drawn-out, scenes of beastiality and other XXXsex stuff were simply not needed.4. There wasnt one character who had my sympathy!"
2,A LET DOWN,"THERE HAS NOT BEEN A BOOK OF CLIVE BARKER'S THAT I HAVE NOT LOVED, UNTIL NOW. HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS WEAVED SPELLS THAT SO PULLED YOU IN, SO ENTHRALLED THAT YOU COULD BARELY PUT THEM DOWN, LET ALONE LEAVE THEM, WHEN YOU HAD FINISHED. COLDHEART LEFT ME WITH JUST THAT, A COLD HEART. I DID NOT FEEL DRAWN IN AND INVOLVED, IN ANY WAY, AS I HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS BOOKS. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT. I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE IN THE STORY, EVERYTHING FELT CONTRIVED AND ""SURFACY"". CLIVE BARKER HAS THE MOST FANTASTIC IMAGINATION, BUT I FEEL IT WAS ON HIATUS IN THIS BOOK. I WILL HOPE FOR MORE THE NEXT TIME OUT."
4,great book,"i just finished clive barker's coldheart canyon and i wasnt disappointed. i must agree with other readers and say that it was about 100 or more pages too long (unimportant or nonrelevent information), but all in all i wasnt ready for the story to be over when i finished it. it took me about 3 days to read it; when i would start again i didnt want to put it down. it does have a lot of sexually explicit language and scenes throughout the story so if youre weary of those types of reads then i would pick something else (i like those types of reads myself so i thoroughly enjoyed it). i also didnt find it at all scary, frightening or suspenseful either, but like i said i liked the story and in a couple-few years i'll probably pick it up and read it again for old times sake."
2,What is the point?,"What a time-waster this is...good grief, I kept hoping it would improve or do something, but no...just tripe through and through. What a huge disappointment, can't believe I was stupid enough to keep plowing through it."
3,I must be getting old.,"I enjoy Barker's imagination and reach, and even his sense of exquisite grotesqueness, and once this book got cooking, it had all of that Barker good badness that makes him so much fun to read. However, I found that the strange sex was layered on a bit too heavily in places-- and it wasn't terribly necessary to the plot, IMO.The best things about this book (loss, sadness, fear of aging, imaginary worlds) could have stood on their own without the explicit nature of the orgies. It also felt as though Barker got confused with the ghost portion of the story because there seemed to be too many plot holes and inconsistencies where the ghosts were concerned.Still, the best author still writing in the horror genre, I think."
1,slips into self-parody,"I had long thought Clive Barker to be one of the most imaginative writers around today. Books like Imagica, The Great and Secret Show, Weaveworld and even Galilee kept me enthralled and kept Barker at the top of my favorite modern authors list.Coldheart Canyon almost seems as if written by another, less talented writer. I never really got into the rhythym of the book. The characters are flat -- I didn't care what happened to Todd the movie star. Even the ""classic"" Clive sections (horror & fantasy) seemed to slip into self-parody -- the grotesque wasn't gross, just descriptive and boring. It was an effort to finish this book, whereas with his other books I had to pace myself not to finish them too soon.I still highly recommend the above titles for fans and those new to his work, but this is one to avoid."
2,Like buttah,This goes down like butter at first. But after a few hundred pages you realize...ick...I'm eating butter.
4,"AMAZING, EROTIC, FANTASTIC, REWARDING!","I really like this novel. Sure it was longer, but that's part of it's charm. This novels very erotic, which I like. I love the way Clive describes sex, the way he'll set the scenery up, the characters, what they are doing and how and they do it. There's nothing perverted about it. I find it more truer to life. And I love the way all the charcters are flawed in his novels, just like life, and the way the characters interact with each other.Clive blows my mind with his imagination. My own imagination is a pretty heated one like his, but man, Clive just keeps on comin'. I truely appreciate him.When coming to the end of the novel, it's very rewarding, I feel like Clive's taught me something that others aren't aware of, I've been let in to his world."
3,Lots of Dragging and Gross scenes,This book is full of dragging detail and gross scenes. There is a little bit of sickness for everyone. Lots of sick sex scenes. Some discusting kill scenes. Some ghosts and an angel. Oh and some characters that you end up hoping will just die so the book will end. The book drags on and on. I gave it three stars because the discusting details are pretty good. I have to give Barker credit for not disappointing me on the gore. I don't think i could really in good concience recommend this book to anyone. Maybe to someone who just wanted to skim for certain kinds of scenes.
2,Just remember Clive has written great ones.,The only thing worse than the style and content of this novel was the length of this novel. It was as if this great author knew how bad this was and tried to write his way out of it---I'm sorry to say that he never made it. Oh so predictable one dimensional characters permeate a plot that wanders and never really comes into focus. His attempt to write dark erotica was pitiful and I felt for his futile efforts. If this book could've been half as long it would've been twice as good---but even at that length it still would've been lousy.
2,Wow... This Was Bad,"I've been a Clive fan for quite some time and I was pretty excited to read this book when I received a positive review from a friend. Well, I just finished it and it was a very unsatisfying read.The kink factor in this book is quite high... to the point of being tedious. The Devil's Country was just a retread of previous Barker imaginary worlds. The dog scene, and many others, were not needed. No character was of interest from the narcistic hero and the demonic diva ""in love"" with the guy she stabs in the next scene, through the reformed agent, to the worst of all... an obese Ripley character.Then there were the plot inconsistencies and the three endings to the book, each ending successively worse...And I thought Stephen King had lost it."
2,"Much, Much Too Long","There's no reason this book had to be nearly 700 pages (hardcover). It goes on and on. A few chapters are devoted to a dog dying, for heaven's sake! They go to the vet, they come home, they go back to the vet, and you keep turning pages. In addition to the careless editing, giant failures in logic undermine the story. The last two sections seem tacked on."
2,Disappointing,"Barker is clever and imaginative, but missed his mark with his latest novel. The book seized me at the beginning, but soon grew wearisome. Barker strained to drag the story along for the last third of the book until he could finally find closure. I suggest reading some of his previous noteworthy works first and avoiding this one."
2,inflation,"From the vanity photo on the cover to the six hundred page length, everything about this novel is inflated. I heard an interview with Clive Barker on the radio in which he stated this novel started as a short story. It was probably a good short story...in fact it still is. Of the six hundred pages, probably 350 tell an exciting, even chilling story. The other two hundred plus pad, inflate, and bore. The story logically ends and then continues for at least two hundred pages. This is a clear example of a good short story turned into an overwrought inflated novel. I'm glad those extra two hundred pages only cost me fifty cents at the library for overdue book fees."
1,SK #1,"Clive Barker is the Liberace of schlock. Along with the rest of the L.A. to Vegas, Tarantino rodent trail."
1,Not Scary,"As a fan of modern horror novels, I was excited to pick up this book after hearing so many good things about it. What a disappointment! It had been awhile since I read a Clive Barker book, the last being The Great and Secret Show, which I enjoyed, although it was a difficult read.The best thing I can say about this book is that it is an easier read than his usual. The premise is interesting (following the same general theme as Weaveworld) but after the first chapter or two my interest quickly waned. My major complaint is that it was not scary. Not once did I fear to turn the page. Barker includes his usual perversions, such as humans having sex with non-humans and other over-the-top sexual situations. The characters were two dimensional and by the time the book was over you just didn't care. Come on Clive, you can do better than this!"
1,"Tarantino-esque ""Dialogue""",Clive Barkers new book is touted by Quentin Tarantino on the backcover. There's a preface where he talks about his deal with Disney Corp and associated corporate publishing (often the same owners Touchstone publishing for example owned by Disney) he makes some vague remarks about commercialization but the fact that this will make writers increasingly beholden to movie studios and hack directors trained on T.V. commercials doesn't impress him much apparently. What follows fails to balance the ethical & artistic flaws which the forgoing imply.
1,Unbelievably bad,"This is the first Clive Barker novel I read. I hated it. It reads like it's a pure Hollywood story. Also, the events in the story are so nonsensical, I couldn't help but continuously think, ""This is stupid.""I love horror novels, but this isn't much of a horror novel. I'll never read another Clive Barker book.Added on 2007/03/24: I forgot to mention. This book is huge. 686 pages. At around 3 different points in the book, I thought, ""Ok now it should end."" Yet it kept dragging on. Bleah.I can't recommend this book for anyone. I guess diehard Barker fans would like it."
2,Very silly book,"Not a masterpiece, not incredibly awful---just a mildy entertaining piece of fluff. It occurred to me early on that this book is nothing but a beach read. There's nothing here to challenge your mind. Good book for a long train ride or the ICU waiting room."
2,possibly the worst book I ever read,"OK it's supposed to be a ""parodY' of Hollywood and it's extremes per page 368 ""There wer movies being shot all over the city. Joyless little pornos.."" so the author subjects us to pages oh his own ridiculous porno- a woman geting off by letting snails crawl all over and in her vagins, obscene over the top sex acts, etc. The basic premise of the book is not bad but like Hollywood it did not need all the crap filler. The author seems to be obsessed with women and their sex lifes and I do believe he's gay (maybe that's why- unhappy memotries of woman). A book made too long and ruined by grotesque unnecessary sex garbage."
4,Not for the prudish,"This is not the book for just anyone who loves fantasy. You have to be a little warped to be entertained by this story, but then again, if you're reading Clive Barker, what would you expect? If you have a good imagination, and are a bit on the ""kinky"" side, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy it. Sexually explicit involving creatures you've probably never dreamed of. Some say it is a bit too long, but I would have enjoyed another couple hundred pages. I've only read a few of Clive Barker's other books, and this one by far has left it's mark in my imagination more than any other."
2,Barker strikes out here,"First I will say that I am a big fan of most everything CB has ever done, but this book is a major waste of time.He mentions that it started as a short-story, and honestly, it would have made a good short story.He also mentions that his father's death and his dogs death figured into the story, which is painfully obvious. The book appears to be therapy for Clive, as there are parts that have nothing to do with the plot, but are obvious reflections of real-life and his attempt to deal with his own loses.Overall, as has been said, the editors really needed to take another look at this one again as well. There as some major plot problems (both in flow, appearance of characters, and the order in which things occur) and some major mistakes.On the positive side, the book does start out well, and interesting, there is a piece there that shows it would have been a very good short story. It should have stayed as such rather than being inflated far beyond what was needed."
3,Coldheart Canyon....,"No, this was not his best, but unlike many of the people who reviewed this story, I do not take off points for grammatical errors. All I care about is the story and the story was good although it was very far from Barker's best. That said, this book is still 100 times better than most of the crap on the racks in this genre.I hope he can return to the Barker of years ago, but I don't think any of the writers really can. They peak, and then fall or die. That is the way of things."
2,A Disappointment,"For years I'd been awaiting Barker's newest publication, constantly checking and rechecking as the dates kept being pushed back, but perhaps they needed to be pushed back even more so that Barker could have turned this pale reflection of his talent into something more moving and cohesive.All of the things I normally love most of a Barker creation were missing or malformed in this work -- the characters were forced into absurd situations, merely so the dodgy threads of this murky story would somehow weave themselves together. The story itself was forced forward instead of propelled by its own momentum of character and imagination. Everything felt out of place, I didn't care about a single person throughout the book's nearly 700 pages, all while I'm desperately trying to like a mediocre work from one of my favorite authors.It just didn't work. Better luck next time, Clive. I'll still be waiting."
2,Starts out really good but gets almost ridiculous after a while,"I bought this book expecting a spine chilling horror novel and got my hopes up during the first 150 pages or so, not because it was scary but because it was funny, interesting and very well written. But then after a turn in the plot (which I won't reveal of course), the story seemed to get a little weird, then strange, then more than a little bit ridiculous. With 450 pages to go, this was a bit of a let down and I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it if it weren't for the very good opening of the book and the hope that some later parts would be as good. But sadly quite the opposite happened, the last 50 pages were surprisingly bad and I was glad when I could finally close this one."
3,More Style Than Substance,"I finished Clive Barker's ""Coldheart Canyon"" with a bit of sadness. For the first time I'd finished a Barker book and didn't find myself thrilling at the adventure and madness I'd just immersed myself in. The book seemed to feature all of Barker's hallmarks: a lurid and exotic premise, characters that haunted one another literally and figuratively and a series of events that seemed to rock the foundation of the world he'd built. But it fell flat for me because I didn't find myself invested in the main characters at all, finding them selfish and their wants and needs petty compared to the weight of the world around them. They're small-minded characters still insisting on getting their superficial wants and needs, even when the face of Heaven and Hell is before them.Barker's writing is top notch, as it always is, I can't think of any writer who has such a handle on the power of prose. Unfortunately, this time not even his words can elevate these characters beyond themselves."
5,None,"i had read only 1 other book by clive barker when i picked up this book. once i started getting into this book i felt a combination of things, such as disgust but also compelled to read more at the same time. simply, i couldn't put it down until it was finished. a must read."
1,Glorified Porn Is Correct,"First the story captivates you, and then the porn begins. Usually its ok because books get through it and move on with the plot. Not this book. Page after page, the most detailed porn and underside of the rock as this articulate (obviously) gay man can muster.Plot is second to his getting his rocks off."
1,Glad I didn't buy this book,I checked this book out from my library as cover picture and blurbs made it sound like a good old-fashioned mystery. I had never heard of the author before.I quickly lost interest and stopped reading it. It's not my cup of tea.
3,Cold ending...,"I read this entire book in 6 days on a trip to China (22 hours on a plane gave me a lot of time). I loved the book until the last 100 pages or so. The story was not quite believable, but enjoyable with the right combo of suspense, sex, hollywood history, and pure horror.The ending was terrible! Barker must have had a tight deadline, because he didn't give the ending much thought. It was very disappointing and then he dragged the book on for an extra 75 pages when the story should ahve ended. It was too bad, because he had a good story going..."
3,"Far, far too much vibrato, and as for the portamenti ... !","I have been very impressed by Ms. Fong's Cage recordings, but here she and the Rangzen Quartet present what to my ears is a travesty of Feldman's Violin & String Quartet. Feldman was no fan of string vibrato, though admittedly he did turn a deaf ear to Karen Phillips's application of such in her viola performances. In this recording it is laid on thick, and to make matters worse Ms. Fong also adds liberal doses of highly unidiomatic unmarked portamenti. Given this failure to identify with Feldman's muse, the delicacy of Ms. Fong's playing cannot make amends. I would recommend avoiding this particular recording and turning to that by Peter Rundel and the Pellegrini Quartet on Hat ArtViolin and String Quartet. It is far superior in every way."
5,The Standard Reference for Fair Isle Knitting,"As an intermediate/advanced knitter I was looking for a book that clearly explained Fair Isle knitting, and I found it! This book, along with Starmore's ""Charts for Color Knitting"" cover every topic and answer every question regarding color knitting. The instructions are extremely well written and clear (very important to someone knitting Fair Isle for the first time) and the patterns/charts intricate and beautiful. I'm inspired to create my own patterns!Alice Starmore's Book of Fair Isle Knitting (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)"
4,A bit over my head right now,It's a really good book but I think it will be a while before i can sue any of the patterns.
2,Very outdated,"I bought this book because it's supposed to be a ""knitting bible"" on Fair Isle Knitting. Well, the designs on the book are really boxy, very outdated and the color choices are a bit shocking. Maybe this is inherent of fair isle knitting (although I don't think so). Anyway, there is no way I'd be caught wearing one of those really awful, boxy designs. I bought the Aran Knitting book by the same author and loved the designs there, so this is very disappointing. I made the mistake of not looking when the book was published and if it has been revised (it hasn't) so save yourself some money and some shelf space and wait until Ms. Starmore updates this book."
5,Excellent technical reference,"While the photography in this book is somewhat old-fashioned looking already, this book is a tour de force in fair isle technique. Of particular interest was the section on knitting steeked patterns, and the design-your own information. This book belongs in every knitter's library!"
2,"hook, line and sinker",I think Ms. Starmore is over rated. She certainlly understands the relationship between proprietary works and profit: buy her book; buy her yarn; buy her kits.
5,You will laugh and you will cry.,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film at the Boulder Life and Death Matters film festival last summer. It is really a beautiful love letter from Lisa Cerasoli to her Gram - and a realistic look at caring for someone with this horrid disease. When life gives you lemons, make lemonades. That's what Lisa did with this film. By capturing Nora Jo's last days with such warmth and humor, it helps soothe the pain of the reality of caring for loved one with Alzheimer's. You have to laugh, or you'll just cry. I have watched this film over and over and over, and recommend it (and the book ""Nora Jo Fades Away"") to anyone currently caring for someone with Alzheimer's, or who has cared for a loved one with this disease in the past. You'll fall in love with Gram, Lisa and her daughter Jazz the first time you see it.Well done, Lisa, and thank you for sharing your Gram with us. Wish I would have known her."
2,Doen Not Work on some machines,"I got this one brand new and the sample song worked great. It looked great and then I installed the software on my conputer. but wait!!! whenever i would access the software it would remove the driver for this mp3 player. called tech support and they tried to help me but finally they told me ""Return it to amazon.com"". We are sorry we could not get it to work on your machine.My configuration:Amd Atlon 2P system with windows 2000 Pro.The tech support guy said that they have not tested this prodeuct on windows 2000 pro....by the way the users manual if funny."
4,sleek yet sinful,"To be a moderator, you would have to listen to a wide variety of music to understand this particular player. The player can play all types, oddly enough the radio even worked. Wow, isn't that cool. Now the various play settings are bleak; suck as rock,pop, bass, and so forth are completely inconceivable. They simply do not effect the play of music in anyway, and the controls are built for the auspicious mind. You must always look at them to see if you're pressing the right button. The player could have been designed better. Finally it's sleek, tender, and smart. Also the battery consumption is amazing. But the controls, equalizers, headphones, and case are not the impressive. Overall if you wan't a cool, sleek and futuristic player buy it. But if you wan't an easy to use and manageable player - look carefully at it, because it can deceive the naked eye."
4,Great mp3 Player,"I must say that with all the choices one can make when purchasing an mp3 player it can be confusing. This is a great player. It has plenty of ram onboard, and with a SD ram slot you can always add more later. Easy to use controls and software. The FM tuner isn't the best but thats not why your really buying it anyway. All around this is a great buy."
2,"Good for the money, good for a while","I bought the Digitalway MPIO FL100 128 MB MP3 Player in about 8 months ago. The software used to upload mp3s (MPIO Manager) would occasionally carsh and I'd have to reformat the flash memory. It used to crash maybe once a week. Then it started crashing a few times a week. About 5 days ago, it began crashing every other time I tried uploading mp3s and eventually started crashing while reformating the memory.It's pretty much dead now and I've had to buy a new mp3 player. The replacement is *not* a Digitalway MPIO mp3 player. Lesson learned.Also, the headphones were a bit uncomfortable.I would not recommend it."
2,Great MP3 Player - Just DON'T change the SD Card,"I purchased this MP3 player about 4 months ago. I'm impressed with the small size. The battery life and the sound quality are adequate, but not great. Unfortunately, the third time I removed the SD card, it would not lock the card when I reinstalled it. So, back to the factory it goes."
3,"Looks nice, but lacks in some areas","I got my player for Christmas. It's small, the sound is nice, and the controls are *fairly* intuitive. However, there's two big issues with this player: First, the manual was poorly written (probably translated from one language to another, and nobody thought to hire a tech writer to make sure the instructions made sense). Second, there is no external power supply -- not even the USB connection can be used for external power. AAA batteries only. Perhaps most players only use batteries, but it seems to me it would've been smart to have some kind of power adapter with this device. Overall, I'm pleased, but I'll buy something better next time."
2,Confussing,"When i first got this item i was totally lost. at first its so difficult to understand the play, pause on/off button is all one the way u navigate things is using this wheels thing the doesnt really turn. the volume goes up to 40, but 40 isnt all that loud considering... i dont even know why it has a key hold button i just dont understand... When i download music the program ALWAYS freezes (im also using xp.) Today i was deleting some files and it freezed so i did my regular thing of un plugging the usb stick and then all my songs went missing! but the room those songs took up is still taken so i tryed to download more songs and it wont let me! Dont buy this product because u will have no luck with it!"
1,"The player is ok, the software is a joke","Don't waste your money on it!I bought this player from ***. Loading music to this player is a nightmare, the software with it is a joke,I don't remember when was the last time I successfully loadeda full album to it, most of the time, it hangs in the middle,sometimes when it dies, the file structure is damaged, you haveto format the memory. It is too buggy to be a commercial roduct.It supports SD card, good, but don't expect to load files viaa card reader, the player won't find them!The only pro is the earbud, I used it with my PDA."
1,Looked like a nice player but too bad it didn't work.,"I have to give this player 1 star. There is NO REASON an electronics item that costs as much as this one does, has a problem working right out of the box. The USB connection from the player to the computer would not stay active, indicating either a bad USB cable or a bad USB connection on the player (my USB hub works just fine with all the other devices plugged into it).. these guys need to learn English! The manual's a joke, good for a laugh. The menus were cool, the radio worked fine, the sound was decent enough, but what good is any of that if you can't trust the player to work a week from now?"
2,Looks Cool - Too many flaws,"The manual is awful. A poor translation that makes sense only some of the time. I could only load a couple of files before it froze. Repeated this with both the proprietory software and Windows MediaPlayer 9 with same results. Returning tomorrow. On the plus side, it looked cool..."
2,"Good, for a little while....","I bought this a year and a half ago. Midway into using it the software program kept on freezing up and crashing. You would get a few songs on this thing, and then it would erase them while trying to add more. It isn't drag and drop, making it impossible to add songs without this faulty program.Don't get an mp3 from a company that cannot provide good support. All their firmware, etc. for this product does not work.I had to buy a new player. this one was terrible!"
1,Full of flaws and lousy service,"Soon after buying the player it seized up during uploading and couldn't be revived. I sent it to the company that MPIO uses for repairs in North America and had a series of problems with them over the 8 weeks it took to get the player back. Since its return it has proved to be prone to crashing and needing to have the battery popped out to reset it. Finally, the software used to up/download files is very buggy and quite slow. You would be wise to steer clear of this company altogether."
2,Could this actually work?,"Yes it is light weight. Yes it looks good. Yes it has nice features. But does it work? I am yet to find out as I have been battling to update the player. I have sent it in to get the firmware updated, downloaded latest patches for XP SP2, MPIO manger 2 etc. If you get through all that you will probably enjoy your player.Research other players, even from the MPIO range, before purchasing the FL100..."
4,Works great!,"The unit is ideal -- perfect size and everything. I love the controls. You don't have to use the software at all, just install the driver and drag n drop your MP3s onto the player just like an extra hard drive. It was easy enough to use, you have to have a sub-normal IQ to not have figured it out."
1,Don't Buy This MP3 Player,Software sucks. Many frustrating hours trying to get this thing to work. Sometimes it works but only after rebooting my system several times. I literally threw it in the trash!
1,BAD BAD BAD... ALL THE WAY!,there is no tech support what so ever! DON'T buy it if you don't want to throw your money away.
2,Dead After 3 Hours,"Just letting folks know - I downloaded about 420MB of songs very easily - software worked pretty good with XP. There was several times that it would just ""freeze"" but I just unplugged the USB cabled and ""restarted"" the FY200, and all seemed ok UNTIL... IT IS NOW COMPLETELY DEAD. All I did was simply hit the delete key to delete a 14MB song that took the total flash memory used to around 420MB and the thing is now completely useless. I tried rebooting my computer and completely restarting FY200 to no avail. Somehow all those 420 songs are still in the flash memory, but completely UNACCESSIBILE on the device itself. No clue. My dear hubby got this for my birthday 2 weeks ago - we have the Best Buy receipt and I'm taking it back today and keeping the cash or maybe will try an IPOD or minidisc. The directions in the manual are completely a JOKE, and from what I've read the customer service will be equally laughable. This is a defective product -do not buy."
4,Digitalway MPIO Fl100 128MB,"It's good, doesn't skip, small and cool-looking, except when it gets fingerprints on it. The price is a little high, and the screen doesn't light up all the time as shown in most pictures. It only lights when you hit a button."
2,DON'T BOTHER,tiny annoying controls. Battery life blows. Get a mp3/cd player instead for alot less with way more battery life and memory.
2,Not good for jogging,"I've had this player a couple of months and I have to say I am not all that impressed. I use it primarily for jogging and it definitely is not designed for that purpose. The buttons on the side are extreemly tiny and not easy to identify with a quick feel. The carrying case is so tight that it actually depresses the volume buttons - I had to actually cut out part of the plastic so that would stop happening. The overall user interface isn't memorable either.That said, the size is perfectly tiny and the expandability is something that most players this size don't offer. I'd be happy with this one if I used it for day-to-day activities that don't involve exercise."
4,Great Player,"I did a lot of research before making this purchase...spent hours reading the pros and cons of a variety on MP3 players before deciding on the MPIO. It has not disappointed me. The unit is easy to use and holds a ton of songs. The WMA option was a big sell for me since I can get nearly double the number of songs loaded (as compared to mp3) Whether you import WMA or MP3 files, the sound quality even at 96kbps (which I use) is great. It has nice features like the ability to listen to FM radio, a lock which holds the buttons in place so a station or song doesn't change when you are biking or running. My only complaint is the manual is terrible and the headphones (earbuds) are very uncomfortable and should be tossed. The battery life so far has been ok...but you should keep spares with you. You won't get more than a couple of hours or so. Overall, great unit..I am very happy with it."
3,Great hardware; no support what so ever.,"The hardware works well, except that you must have the USB drivers to install the FL100. Well, I lost the CD that came with the FL100, and now I can't install the thing at all! The USB drivers are not available for download from MPIO's website, and my repeated emails as well as phone calls have been unanswered for a month! This company provides absolutely no support at all for their product. Consider this before buying...."
1,MPIO is not work with Win XP,After another four days of trying. I tried to work under Win 2000 and found out its great player but not under Win XP. I bought it because this company promise its MP3 player can work with XP no problem. I hope I can get help from [the manufacturer] but still no answer from them. Don't know thoese [others] use what PC OS system? Why my new gateway media center PC can't work? I tried it on win XP home edition and Pro edition all have problem to connect or recognize.
1,Avoid,"Hardware is great. A wonderful little device.The software is next to useless. It simply does not work, and their technical support has not EVER respond to my attempts to contact them.A shame, but unless they actually make software that works, I would have to say avoid buying from them.I have not been able to update the music on the internal memory for months due to the freezing, crashing and very low quality of their code."
1,MPIO review,"Anyone who left a positive review for this item did so within the first weak of purchase. Yes, it is a great player: it has a sleek finish, a nice lcd screen, and plays music. After a few months the only nice thing about it is the look. The software always crashes and I have not been able to add or remove songs whatsoever. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,MPIO Support non-existent,"I really enjoyed my first month with the MPIO FY-200, a very similar model to the MPIO FL100. The unit was small, had good sound quality, and worked well overall. However, once I upgraded the firmware to allow the device to be used as a USB mass storage device, there was no going back (literally). The player could no longer function as an mp3 player, only as a mass storage unit. Myself, and many other disgruntled customers, contacted customer service via phone and e-mail. There was no e-mail response and during the phone call a secretary took my contact information and I was never contacted.I would consider buying from another Company if you expect any customer support."
1,Unable to Download,Extrememly difficult to download-I tried with 4 other computer people and to no avial. I would highly recommend getting a mp3 with better software and directions-they are extremely vague.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"I purchased this item because I was impressed with all of the features for the money.It was fairly easy to download and rip the music from my cds to the included program and load into the player. The earphones included in this are terrible. I replaced them and the sound improved, but I am not impressed with the sound. The bass is weak even with the new headphones and the equilizer set to dynamic bass. Also, the first time I went to use it, the system turned off and wouldn't allow me to play any songs. It has done that twice for no reason at all and no warning. I have only owned it for 6 days.Save your money! I had better sound with my portable cd player. I am returning mine and planning on purchasing the iaudio cw-300. My advice is to not waste your time or money. This company should have put more money into the sound of the product instead of all the bells and whistles."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I agree with the majority of the reviews presented for this mp3 player. Yes, it is compact and lightweight but the problems outweigh this. The software included with the mp3 player is horrible, and while trying to upload songs onto the player, the program will freeze up. I have downloaded all of the software upgrades to no avail. The mpio website, just like the manual for the mp3 player, is not in english. Well, I guess they are, but whoever translated them did a very poor job. The broken english is hard to understand and the player is hard to figure out without proper instructions. I would not recommend ANY mpio products, especially this one. I would stick to brand names like the iPOD where you know you will be able to get the proper support. That will be my next purchase."
2,Weak Software and Indecipherable Manual,"While the sound produced is admirable, the software is, to put it kindly, ""weak"". Windows XP locked several times during download or erase attempts, requiring rebooting. The manual purports to be written in English, but is indecipherable and, for all practical purposes, useless. The actual capacity is somewhat less than advertised (possibly also due to a software glitch). Running or a session at the gym will often affect the performance. The battery power is a plus when travelling, a few small AAA batteries, each lasting about 8 hours, being less cumbersome than a charger. Overall, however, just not in the same class as the ipod."
1,Keep looking for another one!!!,"The only positive quality I can think of is that it is priced very competitively. Other than that, I wouldn't use this player/recorder again even if I received it for free. The actual way you navigate through the software is NOT as outlined in the instruction manual, and does not interface well with RealOne player. The control buttons do not respond well to the touch, and using them to navigate through the functions is very confusing. Also, the battery life is grossly overstated; I was killing a AAA battery a day. I highly recommend a Sony Minidisc player/recorder. A bit more expensive, but definitely worth it."
2,No UMS Support,"When I purchased my FL100 256 MB, everything seemed OK. I thought I got what I needed. One of the main reasons to choose this product was that it had storage capability. But when I got my hands on it, I realized that it reiqured a software to enable the UMS capability, which is not practical for everyday use. I wrote to Digitalway whether it will be possible to release a UMS firmware for FL100, they promised me that they would release it in a very near future. But after some time they announced that they would not work on firmware improvement for UMS support. All FL100 owners became very disappointed after this desicion. MPIO must do everything what they promised. You can visit and see the complaints about their customer and technical support at www.mpio.comI am not a satisfied customer and I protest MPIO since they don't take the necessary action to release a UMS firmware and make the FL100 owners happy."
1,Horrible Customer Support,"I had this unit for just under a year and it stopped working. I was somehow able to contact tech support, shipped them the unit, shipped them the money to repair it two months ago and haven't heard a word since. Emails go unanswered. Voicemails go unanswered. Their phone system is a joke. Apparently they don't care about their customers. If I had to do it over I would not have bought this product."
1,Buyer Beware,"Initially happy with product and features. Within 6 weeks, headphone jack broken from normal use. Customer Service is non-existent, so the 120 day warranty is essentially worthless. 7 tries so far to reach a supervisor or someone that speaks understandable English - they will not provide return forms. Stick with a reputable, well known manufacturer."
1,All it does is crash,"This MP3 player was great within the first couple of weeks. But after a month it is horrible. The program that comes with it crashes and freezes whenever you use it. Making it almost impossible to add and remove songs from the player. When you try and use it with real player instead, the same thing occurs. Leading me to believe it is the payer that has serious issues. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is a waste of money and causes more headaches than anything. I've had this product for a year and it gets worse with time. Please do not waste your money!!!"
1,Bad customer service and support,"I bought this player in January and it worked well for about 6 months. One day the display goes dark and I called customer support as a toll call and held for 45 minutes. After an unanswered email, I mailed it in for warranty repair. They denied the work claiming it was damaged and considered uncovered by the warranty. I would definitely buy another brand of player."
4,big sound in little package,"Received this player on Friday and was excited to use it per the reviews here on amazon. Took a while to set up manager software since I installed it while cable wuz connected to PC (shouldn't have), so had to re-install software. Then it worked like a charm! Volume is strong, but had to cut a hole in the case to control the volume (if not, the case is so tight it pushes the volume knob skyyyy high!). Had to cut another hole for access to the menu button. Only downside was the wristband is not as useful as an armband would be. Try this MP3 player, you will enjoy this big sound in a little package."
1,an MP3 player with a life of only 3 months,"got my FL100 256 mb last December 2003 from J&R tru Amazon, installation is quite a breeze, I was quite happy with it at first - then last night - arrrg, I added 1 new song to my list and it froze, had to disconnect and connect the usb inorder for it to unfreeze - next was able to add the song and while transferring some song in order - it froze again!! Then it displayed error, so I had to reformat the internal memory - and now the power will not turn on - IT IS DEAD!! Whatever happened Digitalway??? I'll get an IPod next time!!"
2,"great design, suspect lousy support","OK- here's the good news: lovely design for the most part. I use it fairly often and haven't noticed any stress problems after about 2 month's use.Here's the bad news: the company doesn't seem to care about customer comments except for 1 cute reaction; the customer community section on their wbsite has beem mysteriously down for an ""upgrade"" for a couple of weeks (they must think we're idiots). Doesn't look like they care about firmware upgrades for this model, and their firmware is always released in a beta state- buggy!Their manual is a joke - really substandard English.Bottom line- not quite ready for prime time. Spend the money if you don't mind changing your player in a year or two, or if you aren't sure if you really want an MP3 player."
2,STUPID,"ok I did like this mp3 player infact I LOVED it but, if you are anything like me and loose things or break things it is the worst product available. I didnt loose the player itself the case it comes with has a clip and it wrked great BUT THE DAMN USB CABLE. It dosent use a common connector type and if u ever loose the usb cable orhave it damaged it is near IMMPOSSIBLE to replace. MPI0.coms Online cataloge is never up in any language ther then korean, so I dont even know if they have it available. But I have looked EVERY where for this cable including this site and it is not to be found. So trust me if u are prone to breaking or loosing things like cables THIS IS NOT THE MP3 Player for you!"
1,"Be carefull, this product is very fragile!!","Be really carefull, the quality of this brand is not good at all. If you're lucky it might work fine for a few months(like some of the reviewers, that seem very happy, but not I have doubts about who really wrote those reviews), but if not it will just work fine for 3 months (the warranty duration) .when I bought it, I didn't put much attention to the negative reviews, and now I have a piece of crack that doesn't work. Belive me the brand is not responsible at all with the quality and postservice. Give it a try before you buy it, send an email to the contacts provided in the web page, and if you get a response at all, I'll pay for your player, deal???"
3,Thoughts from an envious colleague,"Great representation of what the Prospect Church Music Ministry has to offer. Demonstrates what other small churches can do, even with small numbers. Shows a well rounded blend of styles, age groups and mixed media in a church with a growing and thriving Music Ministry. Director, Jason Asbury demonstrates his ability to reach out to many different groups of people and share with them his love of music. This CD includes music that any church choir, large or small would enjoy."
5,INSPIRED MUSICIANS,"This is a diverse representation of Christian Church Music. The recording is clear and bright. From choral standards to contemporary pieces and instrumentals, the mix of amateur and professional musicians come across as being sincere in their Message of Inspiration. It is clear to me that they enjoyed producing this collection as much as the listener will enjoy hearing it!"
3,Where's the rest??,"The Cocteau Twins are an amazing band, do not get me wrong, but 4AD's new let's-sell-best-ofs-to-make-money scheme really failed here (as it did with Lush's Ciao!). Numerous shining moment of the band's career are absent and some of the choices are just bad! Not including Ivo and Musette and Drums or more disdainfully substituting Wax and Wane for Blind Deaf Dumb (clearly the bands more break out track from Garlands) is just preposterous! Here's a great opportunity to throw the NME version of Ivo to the public, or the Red Tape version of Pitch The Baby rather than just using 50/50 clown as filler. The liner notes are just laughable. The remaster is quite good, but there is just something magical amiss in this collection. It's worth it for the remaster, and to have all of these songs in one place (especially Watchlar, one of my personal favorite tunes ever), but they could have done a much better job."
5,Escape to a beautiful place,I cant say anything bad about Elizabeth Fraser. Her voice makes me melt and she takes me where I want to go.The guitarists Will and Robin work in perfect harmony with liz providing a perfect sureal soundscape. Pure bliss.
1,Buyer beware,"I have a different MP3 from this company, but I need to warn anybody considering a purchase from Digitalway. My MP3 failed within 6 weeks - customer service is impossible to get a hold of, even more difficult to understand than the User Manual, and unwilling to send the return/repair forms. The 120 day warranty is worthless."
2,"Not as good as ""Star 80""","This made-for-TV movie called for a better production which came in the form of ""Star 80"" two years later. Not much use in bashing this one, but it is not well cast, the acting is uneven, and it is factually inaccurate.Bless you, Dorothy, wherever you are."
2,Disappointed,"I've always been interested in the story of Dorothy Stratten and try to purchase as much as possible about the subject, and I feel this rendition falls far from the truth and really fits the usual made for Tv dramas that are on TV today, which usually lack accuracy and tend to fill in a lot of blanks or leave key things out. I understand the circumstances behind the making of this, and why some things were changed and I respect that but feel that if you can't keep it somewhat accurate you should at least change the name of it as well!"
2,Terrible movie - don't buy!,"This vendor was fine but the movie was terrible. If you are a Dorothy Stratton fan, don't buy this movie!"
3,First Time Jamie Was Exposed?,"This was one of Jamie Lee Curtis' earlier movies, and probably the first one that featured her in such revealing outfits. Jamie's white bikini scene certainly turned heads, but supporting cast member Tracy Reed donned an even more provocative swimsuit at Hugh Hefner's mansion when Dorothy (Curtis) arrived. I would have liked to see more of Mindy (Reed) in her hot bikini."
5,Century propane hose,The hose worked perfectly as described. I was able to connect my 20# tank to my grill and save a bunch of money.
5,durable,"i use it with my propane tree. works great durable, easy to use.got it at good price, if you have propane tree must have item."
1,Not the best....but I understand the history,"I love Blaxploitation films and having not seen Dolemite I got it out at the local video store, having now watched the film It's the only time I've actually felt white watching a Blaxploitation movie. The film is anti-white as such but I feel you really do have to be black to get most of the jokes etc..The film overall is pretty boring and the acting not the best but I do understand why many black people love this movie out of all the Blaxploitation films. I collect these movies but I'm afraid this one will not be in my collection."
2,Stop Ridin',The thing that makes me mad about this movie is that everyone thinks it's the funniest movie ever. It's not true and it's not a good movie. If you'd like to see a real spoof rent Airplane! The only funny thing about this movie is how bad and how unfunny it is. The only laugh I got from watching it was when I decided I could make a better movie than this. Horrible.
2,The Worst Blaxploitation Film Ever Made,"Everything about this movie was wrong: the plot, the acting, the production, and Dolemite's clothes. I don't even understand why this movie is so loved. Horrible. Dolemite was greazy and disgusting and you couldn't pay me any amount of money to touch him with a 10 foot pole. I'm giving this movie 2 stars only because the fighting scenes were so awful that they were funny."
1,OMG!! This is Bad!,"I heard about this film for years. Even had people tell my I had to see it 'cause it's a trip. It's a trip, alright! A pretty bad one! What really stunned me about this film is the horrible screenplay! Ugh! It was brutal to listen to! The script was so bad, it was laughable! Sure it was a low budget movie! (You can see the microphone a couple of times and you can clearly see the school yard in the background of the opening sequence.) But if they didn't play this straight, I would have enjoyed it much more! Overall, this film isn't what people make it out to be! You're better off hangin' with ""The Mack""! At least they tried!"
5,"No doubt, one of the worst movies ever","And like all the other reviews said, one of the funniest things you'll see. What slays me is how fat this guy is. I mean, he's supposed to be this kung fu expert or whatever, and the guy wears a cumberbund to hide his gut!...Just having boom mikes visible doesn't automatically make for an Ed Wood style comedy (check out ""Walking Tall"", the police station parking lot scene). But there are so many foul-ups along with the bad acting and stupid dialogue, that the entire effect is just a howl from beginning to end. Great for parties."
4,"""I am Joe Blow, lover man""","Although this movie is very funny and fitting, if very low budget, interpretation of Rudy Ray Moore's stylings, it has some horrendous failings. Boom mikes in shots, bad acting, and special effects gone horribly awry are littered throughout, and half of the movie seems to be concerned with showing off people's cars. But, if you like your Blaxploitation movies as gratuitous as they come, then ""Dolemite""'s for you.(In the scene selection menu, on the DVD, the labels were lifted from ""Petey Wheatstraw"" by accident)"
5,the funniest film ever made,"quite simply, the greatest action/comedy ever made, and by far the best movie of the blaxploitation genre...those who criticize such trifles as visible boom mics just don't ""get it""...what ""Dolemite"" is is the story of a 20th century folk hero, told by the people who invented him, with no Hollywood bastardization...Moore is brilliant in the role that defined his whole career...and Creeper the Hamburger Pimp says what is probably the funniest line in the history of all cinema (those who have seen the film know what I mean; it has to do with exactly ""how bad"" Creeper is)...a must-see for anyone who can appreciate black culture..."
4,When bad writing and bad directing make a good movie.,"Intentional or not, this is one of the most hilarious films ever made"
5,In a word...,"I have only this to say: The scene where Dolemite is hovering above the camera as he makes sweet love to YOU, the viewer... You can feel his manly prowess coming right through the TV! Blacktastic!"
4,"Kung-fu, Smooth Talkin', and pimps!","How can this movie go bad with all these ingredients? Dolemite has it goin' on all the way from his casual strut to his infamous ratsoup-eatin' one-liners. I particularly enjoy anytime during the movie when a boone mic was visible. If that doesn't spell Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y, than maybe you should re-evaluate your standards. Not for anyone with a weak stomach or suffering from any recent drug addiction."
1,Not very funny,"Stand up routine is fair, script is without a plot and acting is about the worst I have seen. The only funny part is his clothing. Rent before you buy this one!"
2,JoinAmazon,"I bought the set of 3 in this Protocols of Zion Series. I wished I could give it a 5 star, but the problem isn't the information so much as the style Doc chose to use in presenting it. I wouldn't recommend this product as is. For the money this costs you'd of thought the producers could have used something more than an 8 ft table with Illuminati Card Game cards, and newspaper articles presented by holding them up to the camera while Doc talks and talks and talks. Pretty boring actually. Pricing this product high and spending all their money on a good cover is deceiving to the general public.Too much money, not enough went into the production.SAD"
5,Great toy,Bought this as a birthday gift for my 4 year old grandson. It is easy to operate and durable. My daughter told me it was his favorite present!
1,JUNK! Do not buy!!!!,I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old and at first it worked fine for maybe 3 months. Now it's broken. We have tried everything. Piece of JUNK!!! Wish I could get my money back.
2,Kid galaxy school bus,Not at all durable.. Stopped working though my twin boys dont play with it often... It needs battery changes frequently.. Am not happy with the buy
1,DO NOT BUY,"Worst ever purchase from Amazon. Bought as Chrismas gift, but you'll need both a 9 volt battery for the remote and a phillips screw driver that is long and thin enough to reach the screw deep inside a small hole on the bus in order to install the batteries. We were lucky to find both after 10 mins of seaching all the drawers and toolboxes. But we thought it worths the effort if it's a fun and durable toy until the bus stopped spinning after only 5 mins of play. So it only goes forward now."
1,A disaster from the get go,"I have never seen a more counter intuitive toy. I had to open 6 screws to lift the rubber chassis to install the battery. Two of the screws were jammed and could not come off, it took an hour and multiple tools to get them out. When the cheap rubber chassis was put back, the car would not move because of lack of clearance the wheels would get jammed. I had to cut the rubber off to improve the clearance. finally it worked. It fell from the table and the batters popped out to reinstall them the 6 screws had to be removed again and the saga repeated. Not worth the headache.OH the battery holder was another story the contact springs were loose and putting three AA battery took a plier to get them in."
1,Toy not worth the money,"We got two of these as gifts. Both only worked for a short time. The remote broke almost immediately- we tried 3 or 4 different brands of batteries, but it was clearly broke. I would not waste your money on this!!!"
1,Round and round,It worked briefly when I installed the batteries and put it back in the box to wrap up. But when it was opened it would no longer go straight it only goes around and around. Not sure why. Just feel ripped off. Would not get another toy from them again.
2,"nice idea, but","This was a nice gift, but it stopped working about 6 months later. We are working on replacing it with the company."
3,fun but not tough enough,My 2 year old loves this toy. However after 10 minutes she managed to break it so that it no longer turns. It still works well enough to her.... ok toy for the money but don't expect it to last long!
4,Great for my 19 month old,"Great first remote. The first one we purchased broke, but mainly because my son tried to hitch a ride on it. He's a bruiser. This has been a fun first RC toy."
1,What a disappointment,"I bought the school bus for my 2-year-old son for Christmas. We tried and tried, and couldn't get the battery compartment off. I was able to pry it open to insert the batteries, but once my son dropped it, the batteries popped out. Once we finally got the batteries back in, we discovered the bus would only turn in circles and not go forward. My son loves the toy; however, since it's malfunctioning, I'm unfortunately going to have to return it."
5,Toddlers first remote control,"These are the perfect first remote control for toddler's. I bought the fire truck for my son a few years ago and then purchased the bus for my daughter this Christmas. They are soft and very easy to manipulate. My kids love them. My son still loves to play with his fire truck. The sounds they make are very realistic as well.....Kid Galaxy manufactures nice, durable remote controlled vehicles. Enjoy!!"
3,"Fun, but maybe over priced","I think I have more fun with it than my toddler. He knows the remote makes it go, but I think he feels he has more control when he shoves it across the floor himself.I do like that it is softer plastic so it will bend and flex if he falls on it.Seems a bit expensive. $20 would be a better price, but I have no idea what it costs to make, ship. etc."
2,WORKED FOR 1 DAY ONLY,"BOUGHT FOR MY 4 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS. PUT IN NEW BATTERIES, WORKED FOR THE FIRST DAY. THE NEXT IT WOULDN'T WORK. REPLACED ALL BATTERIES, JUST IN CASE, BUT NOT THE ISSUE. JUST BROKE...WAS NOT DROPPED AND DID NOT GET WET. POOR QUALITY I GUESS. AS FAR AS DELIVER...VERY FAST, AND PACKAGING WAS IDEAL. TOO BAD THE TOY WAS POOR QUALITY AND I TOSSED OUT THE WARRANY, IF THERE WAS ONE. OH WELL"
5,Amazing first RC Car!!,"I got this toy for my son's 2nd birthday and it was a huge hit! It runs good on the carpet and awesome in the kitchen! Very good material not too hard and not too flimsy, and my son is getting good with the controls, my 4 year old daughter loves it just as much as he does! Amazing toy!"
2,disappointed,"Quality is poor. The chassis fell off immediately and very disappointed. This was a birthday gift, and to have it fall apart just taking out of the package was embarrassing."
2,Worked great for an hour.,"I got it in the mail today as a birthday gift for a five-year-old. Needed batteries, okay no problem/. It uses a 9 volt for the remote, which is okay for radio controls I think. Worked good for a small child's RC car. I liked its squishy rubber exterior. About one hour later, no longer turns, just goes slower when turn button is pressed. Not very happy."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Completely useless - Doesn't work even after spending $$ on ""extras"" - a 9 V battery and the thin screwdriver. Not worth it!"
4,Love it!,Both my sons (age 2 & 9) like this toy! Gave it to the younger one for Christmas. Bangs into things with no illl effects. Does sometimes cross signals with other electronic toys that are active at the moment. But even then it just moves a couple inches and really it's a good reminder to turn it off! Great toy!
1,Did not work,"My 2 year old son got this for Christmas and was all excited to use it. However, once we got the batteries in both the remote and the bus, we realized that it didn't work. What is strange is that, if left on, the bus will start to move on its own. However, you can't make it work with the remote. We will be returning this."
1,Terrible toy,I should have paid attention to the reviews. This toy never worked. I can't even comment on how it worked as an rc because it never worked.
2,Does not last!,"This toy appears to be good quality and is easy to use and my little boy enjoyed it until it stopped working...within less then a year of occasional use. Changing out the batteries did not prove to be helpful. It simply ""gave up the ghost"" and was ready for the trash bin. Very disappointing."
4,RC School Bus,"Kid Galaxy ""My 1st RC"" School BusI purchase this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson that had just turned 3 yrs old. He was delited with sounds and turns of the bus. The two button remote was easy for him to use. It kept him entertained for hours."
4,NICE TOY,My 2 1/2 year old enjoys playing with this toy. It is a nice first start to any child's remote control toy collection.
2,Very poor quality control,"The bus would not move when we started playing with it, and I quickly discovered why. There was no clearance between the soft body of the bus and the wheels, which prevented them from turning. Because the wheel wells are molded to cover more than 180 of the wheel circumference, raising the body to provide clearance was not an option. Because I didn't want to disappoint my son on Christmas by telling him we had to return the toy, I ended up cutting the case (which is soft plastic) to provide the necessary clearance for the wheels to turn. It doesn't look as good, but at least it works."
1,Don't recommend,"Got this toy last Christmas for the kid. The batteries fall out inside of the toy if you play even slightly rough with it. Can't get them out easily without unscrewing the bottom. So I cut a slit in the back (it is made of a rubbery plastic).It only turns right (or left, can't remember) and only turns on a pivot so it doesn't go very fast or far without having to move it by hand.Slow and boring even for a less than 1 year old. Only plus was that it was kind of cute for a bus."
1,Do not buy,"I do not normally write reviews for things, but I was so thoroughly disappointed with this toy that I wanted to warn others. I bought this bus for my 3 year old as a Christmas present. It goes really slow, no matter what kind of batteries you use. The turn button on the remote control stopped working on day 2, so now we have a bus that only goes forward. My son has even told me ""I don't like slow buses."" I have one of the amphibian morph cars, and that works great. But, this bus is a horrible purchase."
4,Given as a gift and was well received,I have not used this product myself since it was a gift to my girlfriend's son. One of his friends had the same model and it seemed to last and perform well. The recipient is very happy and uses it regularly.
3,not good for citrus!,"I bought this product last week and was super excited to use it to juice the oranges from my tree, and do it much quicker then the manual one. I thought WRONG! After juicing about 25 oranges, I took my first taste- Disgusting! It tasted very strongly of orange peel. After reading the recomendations, it states ""for best results peel citrus"". So after hours of work to peel 40 more oranges, my hands stung and I lost a lot of juice!The machine itself worked well and stayed strong through the juicing, but if you are looking for an easier way to do citrus, this is not it!!!"
1,horrible customer service,"Hello all,I've purchased my power juicer pro & spent over $250 for all the hoopla. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service these people provide. The reps r not trained well & are very rude & will not reslove ur query. No supervisor will treat you better either. Keep waiting for their calls & months will pass.Do not purchase any warranty cause its a waste of your money. Unless you intend to follow the recipies, don't spend your hard earned money on that either.I am so exhausted waiting on these people. I have prepared a draft to send to BBB, they will hear from them very soon!I have learnt from this & am never going to trust any infomercials that I watch on TV ever. Might as well go to Jambha juice & drink what is real!"
1,"Do not buy this, plastic parts break","The plastic part that holds the blade just shears off, I used it 12 times and based on research this is a common problem, it is not covered under warranty, it makes your juicer useless, not to mention dangerous if it happens when it is in operation. Who would make something that takes that amount of torsion out of plastic??????"
3,Juiceman JR is Cheaper & More Feisable,"Product Design= 1 1/2 Stars.I got the juicer today and the first thing I noticed that did not like was the on/off switch is in the back of it. So you have to give it a reach around to start it. The worst things about this juicer is the spout is not high enough for a normal glass. You need to use a tiny glass, which of course does not hold alot of juice. Next, there is no top/lid/roof above the spout so it spits all over the place. The big hole on top to load stuff is good if you are juicing an orange, but if you juice a carrot it smacks around like popcorn, rattles the juicer and it spits oll over the counter. It's kind of bulky and annoying to clean also. You have to unscrew the screen. I would recommend the Juiceman JR. Half the price and no quirks. The biggest joke is you can only fit a mini glass under the spout unless you put the juicer on a wooden cutting board. The spitting was obnoxious. I'am not gonna return it. But I wouldn't recommend it."
1,so sad. Big disappointment.,"I didn't get to use this juicer much. A plastic part that holds the whole thing together broke and customer service tells me it can not be fixed. They say I can buy a new base (the motor part and all) for $49, plus shipping. Yeah right. I'm just so sad I have to put this gift in the trash. I really wanted to use it. :("
2,A Lot of work from what they portray on TV,"My wife purchased this thinking it would be a great thing to be able to make natural fruit juice rather than purchase it in a store with all the additives and sugar..which is true, but the way they market this machine on Tv is far from what you actually get. It is a lot of clean up and you constantly have to clean off the blade because it does get clogged so easily. The spout also doesn't make sense because it goes strait out instead of pointing downward which juice gets stuck unless you are constantly putting fruit in the machine, because it doesn't tilt down. With that being said, since it doesn't tilt down it also has a tendancy to spray out when putting fruit in the machine. This is a good machine for getting natural juice, it's just very very messy and a lot of clean up and the pulp catcher isn't anything to speak about either."
4,Meets the challenge,"The juicer is my first. One thing I am not happy about is the groove in the middle compartment which may hold specks of left overs and cleaning that is a pain. The opening was said to allow dropping fruit as a whole, well I suspect that as even granny apples could not fit whole. Good thing is pulp is relatively dry with no juice left."
3,"Works well, but still too much trouble cleaning",No complaints with this juicer's functionality or the way in which it comes apart to clean it. It's just that I don't have the time to use it knowing that there are about 6 parts that need to be taken apart and cleaned with each use. It's easy and well thought out but for one person it's too much trouble to use.
2,Ricardo,"The Kack Lalanne power juicer is a farce. The parts are made of plastic and when the break you cannot find spares. The customer service does not answer calls; you get an everlasting lecture from a lady then she hangs up. What a mess? I regret buying two of those products.Ricado,Jamaica"
4,Jack Lalane Power juicer,"I love this juicer!! This is so much better than the one I was using before. And it does not create so much noise when I'm using it. It does make a lot of juice. However, the fruit that I put in it sometimes jumps and makes a rattle sound if I do not hold the pusher firmly. But over all, it is great.... And shipping is quick. Thank you amazon."
1,Takes too long to think I would do this daily,"I'll keep this short because it's all been said. This is not a good product. It leaves lots of very wet pulp on the inside. I put in 4 leaves of kale, 2 celery stalks, 10 baby carrots, and 3 apples. In return I received about 4 or 5 oz of juice. The cleanup was the deciding factor for me. I even needed a screwdriver. There's no way I would do this everyday. I posted pictures of the cleanup process."
1,Whisper quiet motor...,"Well, wow is this a piece of junk. I bought it about four years ago and used it a few times. Then I let it sit on the counter for years. I started to use it again for a week. The juice was great but it was such a pain to take apart and clean. I decided to use it again this week. So I just went to the store and spent $200+ on fruits and veggies to do a juice fast. Thanks a lot- on the second day the motor went out and it is completely dead. Whisper quiet motor because it is on its death bed when you buy it. You get what you pay for and for a good juicer you have to pay. Lesson learned."
4,Still going strong after 8 years!,"I bought this juicer at least eight years ago. I love it. I had another brand first that was way too loud and difficult to clean. I juice about 4 times a week but I only juice veggies and an apple; not sure if that makes a difference for some people. I have not had to replace anything. I think it's a quiet juicer - I would say a little quieter than my Oster blender. I agree with another reviewer (and strongly recommend) to rinse the parts as soon as you finish making the juice; it's fast and easy. I don't bother with scouring the stains, I just rinse the parts and set out to dry. One time-saving tip I do: I rinse/clean all my veggies when I bring them home from the farmer's marker and then I separate them into juicing batches in those green, stay fresh bags. That way, when I'm ready to juice, all I have to do is pull out a bag from the fridge and the bunch of veggies is all ready to go!"
1,I can't recommend it.,"I got this juicer as a gift for Christmas. For the short time that it worked, I liked it. It was quiet and it made decent juice. But after about 2 months the base started separating. Now after 3 months it's totally broken and unusable. A juicer this expensive should last longer than 3 months."
3,good for the price,"this juicer works real good on lemons, oranges and even grapes but don't recommend it for mangos, pineapples or even apples, just not heavy duty enough for those, but for the price its a good deal. Make sure to clean it well after each use and it works fine and hopefully will last longer."
2,No replacement part...,"I enjoyed using this juicer for about 6 months.. however, when a plastic piece had broken, I called to order a new piece from the company. Much to my dismay, there was no replacement piece that could be ordered! So the machine was just broken! I was very disappointed :("
1,Customer Service is the worst,"While the juicer is decent for a novice on a budget, don't expect to order any parts when they break. I've ordered a new pulp collector, and three months later am told it's still on ""back order."" I'm on hold this minute (and the past ten minutes). They tell me the parts are made in one country and the orders are taken in another, so they don't really know what they have when they take your order. If you ask to speak with a supervisor, you will be on hold forever.Basically--this company is not worth working with."
2,It will fail on you.,"If you want to make occasional juice for like 1 or 2 glasses it will suffice. But if you really plan on making a descent batch of juice, Don't bother! It will get clogged and start to vibrate violently and smell like rubber. Even if you clean it it will immediately fail again. I definitely do not recommend this Juicer save your money and get something better!"
2,"Served me well, until I got into real juicing.","I didn't use this Juicer that much. I would go into kicks of juicing, then forget about it for a while. I've had it for about two years now, and the only reason it lasted me this long is because of my infrequent juicing. In my latest bout of juicing, I was in the middle of juicing a green lemonade. I had just juiced some kale and lettuce, and then it was time for the lemon. I put ONE lemon in, and the juicer broke!! It didn't even finish juicing the lemon. The recipe I was using called for one whole lemon to cut through the taste of the green juice. The rind had been taken off of the lemon, and after that I had a naked lemon and no way to juice it. The juicer had a warranty, but after reading reviews of the warranty, I wasn't going to bother getting a new Juicer. It's time to upgrade, anyway, to a juicer more relevant to my current obsession with juicing."
2,Died with little use,"I believe I used this a total of approximately 6 times.On the last use...it died....never to be resurrected...very; expensive juice indeed.Overall it did a fair job of juicing, when it was working, the clean up requires a fair abmount of work.I won't buy another..."
5,more juice out of the fruit,"I own a Jack la lanne for about 2 years now. Since then, I`ve bought my boyfiend a very expensive Breville Elite Juicer, which is very good, much easier to clean an assemble and dissemble, but it just doesn`t make as much juice out of the same amount of fruit as the JLL. The left over pulp is moist and you can still squeeze a little juice out of it with your hands. Than I bought my dad a Breville regular juicer, and it is basically the same as the Elite, only cheaper. Now for my brother I have bouth the JLL. In my opinion it is the best, the pulp is dry, it really takes all the juice out of the fruit.If you want more juice, buy this. If you want ease to use and clean, buy one made of stainless steel."
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware! Biggest rip off on the market. Yes lifetime warranty- Ours broke after one use and they will send out a new part for 30 dollars. That is not lifetime, only if your life lasts 60 days. After 60 or 90 days it is going to cost you more money. Do not buy this juicer!"
1,"Good Juice, But Disaster to Cleanup","I'll be short and to the point. I must admit, I hardly use this myself as my wife does most of the juicing and leaves the cleanup for me. Although the juice tastes great, the cleanup is a mess. We've learned to put a plastic bag in the pulp bin, so we don't have to clean that out, just throw the bag away. But then there's the blade, the filter piece, the top, and the piece of plastic used to push the fruit down. Sure, the juicing is easy, but the cleanup is easily triple to amount of time. Fruit pulp gets stuck everywhere, especially on the filter piece as the holes are tiny. Bottom line, find something else and save yourself time and the water it takes to clean this thing."
2,Not well built,"This juicer is not built to last. I understand the price is low, but building something that can not last a reasonable time is a waste of resource. And the blade is powerless,the motor pauses when juicing hard fruits. I should have bought a better juicer. Do not recommend."
1,Engineering Flaw,This machine is engineered to fail. The main bolt that spins at thousands of RPM's is made out of cheap plastic! Brought this and show my dad when he pointed it out and let me know how his broke (I totally forgot he owned one). Sure enough one month later while gingerly tightening it the POS sheered on me.
2,Everything Not Included,Product arrived on time but the box was already opened. The directions and juicing book were not in the box. Ordered same product for same price from different person and directions and juicing book were included. Juicer works great however I purchased more than the juicer which I did not get.
2,Wanted to like it but ended up disappointed,"I just bought this two days ago and it's now boxed up and ready for return. Having to go on a 10-day cabbage juice cleanse, I was hoping this would save me some cash to juice my own cabbage as opposed to having Whole Foods juice for me by the lb. Not so. It's hard to clean and more important, the yield is extremely low - one whole large cabbage only gives you about 6 oz of juice. You can't really ball up cabbage as the instructions note so you are left with a ton of roughage in the pulp bin. Pretty disappointing considering the cost of organic cabbage these days. I am now researching other juicers to see what might be a good alternative."
2,Motor Failed After 6 Months of Daily Use,"This was my first juicer and it was a great buy if you are a beginner. I started with this juicer, then I got hooked on juicing and I juiced every morning! I lost 15 pounds and I love the idea that my two year old gets all natural fruits and veggies in a drink every morning too! Sorry to say however that the Jack Lalanne Juicer's motor failed, after exactly 6 months of daily use. It's in the garbage can as I write this. I'll be shopping for juicer with a more powerful motor."
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"This is a terrible Juicer. This was sold at Costco, so I thought well Costco generally carries great products so I went ahead and bought it. It was cheaper than the Breville Juice fountain which had been a trusty Juicer for my sister which I saw my sister use everyday through her entire pregnancy.I was DEAD WRONG!!! Jacks juicer sucks. It chokes on any pressure (i was juicing an apple). This is a below par piece of plastic, that wouldn't be useful for a doorstop.I returned it immediately and went and bought a breville Juice fountain, now that is what Ima talking about. That baby has power, I LOVE MY BREVILLE JUICE FOUNTAIN!!!"
1,Cumbersome and Messy,I purchased one of these from the infomercials and it was a horrible decision. The juicer sprays juice all over my counter. It is hard to clean and the machine also gets jammed frequently. I am upgrading to a masticating juicer soon.
1,Juicer got juiced after a week,"Well that was quick. After a week of daily use, the juicer went berserk. I cut up a mix of apple, pears, carrots, and leafy greens to put in the juicer. After successfully juicing the greens and apples, it was the pear's turn. I threw in the quartered cut pears and the whole juicer started rattling violently making a huge ruckus in the kitchen. I shut off the machine immediately and began to smell burnt electronics. I then proceeded to open the machine and saw white shards of plastic in the pulp collector, in the round metal screen, and even in my juice! After further investigation, it looks as though the metal blades went off balance and started shredding the plastic chute where the fruits enter the machine. Will be returning the unit and purchasing a non Jack LaLanne juicer."
1,Terrible juicer,"Maybe this juicer is fine for soft things, but forget it when it comes to juicing carrots or anything remotely hard. It takes forever, you have to push hard for very little results, the motor stalls and stops: in short, it's terrible. Don't waste your money."
1,Do not buy,"I received this product when I order 0n 5-19-08 from Amazon and about 13 days afterward I received the juicer. It quit working 6-26-08. I called the distributor Triad and they informed me that my only recourse was to write this bad review, or give Triad another $ 49.99 for a new motor. Heck, all I paid for was a juicer and you would expect that could be use for 30 days. Let me see, $ 113.00 cost of juicer, pretty expensive juice!!!!!!!! You see Amazon says you can ship it back 30 days from purchase. Well if the shipping eats up most of the thirty days, Well, you figure!"
1,It did'nt work at all,"I purchased this item as a gift for my ailing sister, to help with her healing process. Unfortunately, the juicer did not function at all when turned on. My sister never got to experience it's use.fb"
1,Blade does not work,"I received this machine promptly and was impressed with its appearance, and its large-looking capacity. BUT..the very first time we tried it, it would not juice anything we put into it. We got a little juice, and then it spit the vegetable or fruit out into the pulp basket. It was not overworked, as it did not shut off. You could see and hear the blade spinning, but several attempts did not deliver the expected juice.Not a terribly expensive machine, but one would expect it to work! I am wondering if we bought a replacement blade, whether it would work and be worth it.Did we get a ""lemon""?"
1,It smokes!!! Literally,I was just sick when I plugged this in and it started smoking ..scared me to death....then I went back to where I ordered it and several others had written the same thing...be for warned...I think there are major problems in this product..
1,CANNOT GET SINGLE ACCESSORIES - PACKAGE ONLY,"I HAVE THREE OF THE JUICERS. THE FIRST POWER JUICER THAT I BOUGHT WAS OK. SO I BOUGHT ANOTHER. WITHIN A MONTH OF GETTING THE SECOND ONE, THE FILTER BASKET BROKE WHEN TRYING TO REMOVE IT FROM THE HOUSING. THE HOUSING WAS TOO TIGHT AND DID NOT RELEASE THE BASKET PROPERLY. THE BASKET CANNOT BE REPLACED WITHOUT BUYING AN ENTIRE ACCESSORY PACKAGE FOR $26.00. I DON'T NEED ANY OF THE OTHER PARTS AND JACK LALANNE WILL NOT SELL THE REPLACEMENT BASKET ONLY. SO THE JUICER IS WORTHLESS NOW. AT THE SAME TIME THAT I PURCHASED THE SECOND POWER JUICER, I ALSO PURCHASED THE EXPRESS JUCER FROM JACK LALANNE. THIS JUICER HAS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW. THE JUICE NOT ONLY COMES OUT OF THE SPOUT WHERE IT IS INTENDED TO COME OUT, BUT IT ALSO GOES DIRECTLY GOES INTO THE MOTOR AND COMES OUT OF THE MOTOR HOUSING. SO I GUESS IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE MOTOR IS RUINED. THERE IS NOBODY AT JACK LALANNE TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT IF YOU WANT TO BUY ANOTHER JUICER."
2,dont do it!,Used 1 time and motor blew out!Need key to clean too!Do not buy! Cheap construction. Horrid customer service as well.Try the breville-stronger motor..
2,clogs often,"I got this juicer as a gift to replace my old juiceman jr. And I have to say that this machine is not all it's cracked up to be. I juice alot of kale and leafy veggies, and they kept getting stuck and stopping the motor. What use to take 5 seconds to juice on my old juiceman jr. took 5 min. of fussing and unclogging on this new machine. Very dissapointing. Mabye I just got a bad one."
1,I am sending this one back,This is my 2nd juicer. Jack's juicer got stuck on an apple and then on parsley. Not to mention it sprays juice all over the table while putting the juice into the cup. The table I had it sitting on was a mess after I finished juicing. There was little cut up carrot pieces around the back of the table and carrot juice sprayed in the front. This baby is going back. --Oh and you cannot fit a whole apple into the juicer mouth. Well maybe if it was a really small apple.
4,Very easy machine,"I find this machine very easy to use & have ran a large number of fruits & veggies through it over the last two months. The ""tough clean-up"" isn't difficult with hot soapy water & a toothbrush. Have also found running citrus last help cut anything that has a tendency to stain."
3,Powerful Yet Cumbersome,"Pros:- Powerful juicer- Comes with its own cleaning toolsCons:- Many parts that needs to be cleaned each time you use it- Assembly is a bit cumbersome- LoudJuicers would be more practical if you have to make a lot of juice each time you use it. Just need to store the juice in the ref. Otherwise, if you only need to make a couple of glasses, all the hassle maybe not worth it. You have to assemble the equipment, then you have to clean it and store it back to its place in the shelves. Some parts of this juicer are also sharp and you must be careful handling them.Recommended: Yes (with some trepidation)"
4,good product,I had a juiceman junior before for many years. I recently replaced it with this Jack Lalane model. I really like the wide mouth and the ease to take it apart.
3,Jack LaLanne juicer,"I've used this JL juicer for approx. 3-4 years. It took me a while to learn how to deal with the quirks, like the feeder problem and how to deal with it when it cuts off and other little things. It did not come with a juice pitcher. That was unacceptable for the price as compared to cheaper juicers. Now I have been without a juicer for 2 months due to that little screw that holds down the basket and blade.I think it was designed to break in order to force you to purchase that pricey part where the screw is attached. I was screwed royally and I miss juicing so much[[ASIN:Jack LaLanne JB Power Juicing Machine"
5,Juicer,The juicer is a quality product and provides a daily fresh healthy juice. This family is more healthy and happier with the use of this juicer.
2,Great for 2-months...,"It worked great for two months, used it everyday. Didn't mind the cleanup, it takes a whole 5-minutes, not going to complain about that for the great juice. But the spinning base that the basket sits on cracked, and then this morning completely broke. I called their customer service and they offered to sell me a new base instead of standing by their product. I'm buying a Breville as a replacement, based on its great reviews.If this juicer didn't break, I would have no other complaints."
4,Good Juicer,This is my first juicer and overall I am satisfied. There is enough juice extracted that I am not upset about wasting money. I understood going into this that there is clean up involved. But the whole things usually only takes about 5-7 minutes. The reason why I purchased this was because it was reasonably priced and it has a lifetime gurantee on the motor. plus you can order replacement blade and all for 20.00 bucks on the jack lalanne website. I noticed that if i put like a few prigs of spinach insted of a full handful it will go straight to the pulp catcher. but other than that I am satisfied.
2,Poor Customer Service,"I was given this Power Juicer for Christmas. I used this everyday. The beginning of April, the motor burnt out. I only juiced what the book said I could juice. It was used daily, as I would expect a juicer should be used. We called the phone number with the warranty, since it has a lifetime warranty. They said they would send a new motor and we would be charge $20 for the shipping. 3 1/2 months later we received the motor for the Montel Healthmaster. We called to find out why and ask for the correct one to be sent. They first accused us of telling them we had the Healthmaster. Then said they would send the correct one for a charge of $20. After some arguing, they finally said they would send for free. I was happy with the juicer while it worked. But, if it only lasts 3 months, then wait 4 months for replacement, I am not really getting the benefit."
2,Hard to use,I found this hard to use and not realy worn the price. Too much fruit for too little juice.
1,cheap garbage,"I used this thing maybe 50 times, and had the same thing happen as many others did. The plastic screw which attaches to the motor spindle completely shattered. I contacted customer service and they said I would have to purchase another base unit for $50. I guess their lifetime warranty is a scam, because this piece is an integral part of the motor.Anyway even when it was working, pain in the neck to clean and gets boring to use after awhile.DO NOT BUY!"
3,Nice Juicer if You Put the Work In,"I bought this after being amazed buy the commercials on tv. The product does work as they describe, but it is definitly a lot more time consuming then they show on tv. It takes almost 10 apples to make one glass of juice! Maybe I did not use the same apples as they do on tv, but it would seem no matter what juice you are making you need a hefty amount of fruit to make a full glass.The machine is powerful, and it does grind the fruit very well. However, it is VERY loud. On tv you can hear it, but when you have it at home its super noisey. Also, I have had a few occaisions were the motor seemed to overheat and I had to let it cool down before I could use it again.This is the only juicer I have ever bought so these things may be normal for juicers. It is easy to clean which is the best part about this item."
1,Horrible Purchase Experience,"I purchased this juicer from the infomercial. I have a Juiceman II Juicer (still working years and years later) and the motor is kind of loud. I purchased the Jack LaLanne Power Juicer because it was supposed to be quieter and the chute was larger. BIG MISTAKE!!! I should have known something was wrong when I was asked if I wanted to purchase a refurbished one by the salesperson for a discounted price. I bought the new one and it was not even a month when smoke started coming out from the wiring. I thought it was going to catch on fire. It never worked and they would not answer my questions and I could not ever get information to return the juicer. HORRIBLE PURCHASE! So, I am still plugging away with my Juiceman II juicer that I do love, but am wondering what I am going to do when it finally wears out. I am afraid to purchase again."
1,NO Customer Service!!!,Good luck with your juicer. Mine arrived broken. A little cheap plastic tip was broken and without it the juicer will not run. The customer service is LOUSY!! I am still waiting on just getting a shipping label from the company to mail the broken one back!! I CANNOT recommend this product.
1,I loved it.... util platic screw broke and it became useless!,"I will not write a long review, since everything has already been said in the 300+ reviews. Just wanted to state that I've experienced the same problem as other reviwers: My juicer worked wonderfully well... but 2 days ago, (after a year or year and a half of using it) the plastic screw that everybody is mentioning, broke, and now it doesn't work at all. The problem is that this screw is not a part of the juicer that can be replaced: it is attached to the motor itself. So I have a perfect motor, in a useless machine! I will not be buying this brand again."
1,Yikes! What a Yucky Mess it Leaves!,"To be fair, this juicer does provide adequate juice. But the thing makes such a mess that in the end the juice really isn't worth the effort. Not only will machine's unstable wobble spray carrot pulp all over your kitchen counter, windows and cupboards, but the machine's mesh screen requires top-secret high-heat micro-wire brush sanitizing techniques that can only be found at NASA. From the time you take this monster (it's way too big for the average family) out of the cupboard you had to have built specifically to store it in, juice your juice and clean the umpteen parts, it's about 20 minutes of work for 12 ounces of juice. If you have that kind of time, maybe it's worth it."
1,Totally Worthless,"I have owned 2 juicers previous to buying this one. The Juicelady, which worked perfectly for 5 years before breaking, and the Hamilton Beach big mouth, which worked great for 2 months.I bought this one at Target, thinking that it would be of better quality than the Hamilton Beach, since it was 50$ more. Was I wrong!!! This juicer could not handle carrots at all! We cut them as small as possible, and it still could not juice them. The motor is not strong and the cutting blade is not sharp enough. I dont understand any of the positive reviews for this machine. Dont waste your time and money. I'm strongly inclined to just spend upwards of 200$ to find a decent juicer."
2,Not the Best,"This is my second juicer and it was quite a disapointment. Too many parts that don't fit well. You need a special tool (provided) to take the blade in and out. It clogs easily, it overheats easily and yes, I cut up my fruits and veggies first and have mostly used carrots and apples. The pulp was wet and stuck to the collector.Its a pain to wash. I used it a total of 15 times and it overheated after making about 1/2 cup of juice. I just tossed it in the trash can."
2,A quiter,I loved this juicer from the get go. I Used it almost daily for 2 months until it stopped on me.
2,Very disappointed,"I grew up watching (and trusting) Jack LaLanne, but after purchasing three different juicers from his cmpany, I am ready to sing his exiting song, ""it's time to leave you...""First machine we bought: I couldn't get the the bar that closes the machine to go over the top. The second machine eventually did the same thing to the point that we couldn't even open it to clean it! You would think I would stop buying his juicers, but I was so impressed with the ease of cleaning it, compared to others, that I once more, bought a third machine, and right out of the new carton, the machine did not work. When we called the manufacturer, we were told that there was a defect in the motors of that model. We're done. My advice, Jack looks like a very nice guy, but get your next juicer from a different company. I heard Champion is very good. That's going to be my next one. I love my Vitamix, but there is nothing like pure juice (without the fiber, which by the way, is easier on the digestive system)."
1,Jack LaLanne Power Juicer - Juice Extractor- The ultimate Lemmon,"I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh juiced fruits & vegetables and did feel more energized from my Jack LaLanne Juicer which was given to me as a gift. However, after 2 months of using the juicer 4-6 times a week, it stopped working and it did not juice the apples and beats easily.Of course, there is no longer a warrenty so I cannot get it replaced."
3,Loud and not easy to handle,"My mom gave me hers used so I'm not out any money, thank goodness.Yes, you can put whole carrots, celerystalks, apples in without having to be a sous chef. It does extract 90% of the juice out of the veg/fruit judging by the dryness of the leftover pulp. The cons are that it is loud although its advertised on the internet as ""whisper quiet"". Fruits/veggies get the blade jammed at times. The feeder compress gets stuck in the chute and it takes hercules strength to undo it. Cleanup is not fun, but I guess any juicer would not require less than 4 steps. If I was in the market for a juicer, Id buy another Jack Lalanne model or another brand altogether, dont spend on this."
2,Not dishwasher safe,"I just received one as a gift. After just a couple of uses, the cover & juice bowl warped in the dishwasher. It won't fit back together. When it did work I liked it overall. It was quiet but a little underpowered compared to the Hamilton Beach juicer I've had for 8 years."
2,Had it a few months and then it broke,"I bought this juicer elsewhere and used it daily for about 2 months. Then, when unscrewing the blade, the plastic threaded piece that is attached to the motor snapped off. I wasn't putting undo pressure on it, I didn't tweak it, I was unscrewing it with the provided tool. It juiced well for the most part, I was satisfied until it just broke. I won't be buying this juicer again."
1,planned obsolescence on steroids !,"Go ahead and spend a bit more money on a quality machine. The parts of this machine WILL NOT hold up if you use it regularly. I went through two before I grew a brain. So yes, they fooled me twice. Even the screw that turns the motor breaks very easily (plastic). Once that goes, you might as well trash it."
2,NOT impressed,"I'm not impressed with this juicer. Kale gets stuck even when added with carrots, thought I was going to burn out the motor but shut it off in time. The juice is mediocre and the pulp is very wet indicating I'm not getting as much juice as I should. It stains very easy but I wash it right away so have managed to avoid the staining of my juicer that other people I know who have this model have experienced. My plunger somehow has water inside of it I can't locate a leak but obviously there is one so I won't be able to use it at all now...the thought of stale water leaking into my juice isn't exactly appetizing. Guess I will save my money for a stainless steel model. Sorry Jack, I adore you but am not impressed with your juicer."
2,Bringing it back.,"This is my second juicer. I ended up getting it because I had heard so many great reviews and thought, well it can't be that bad. I picked in up at my local Big Box retailer and I must say, it is simply awful. Don't get me wrong, it works most of the time but that doesn't make up for the jamming of the motor. It gets caught up on the smallest amount of pulp in the shoot and it shreds ripened pears into nothing but pulp. But I guess the big question is, why am I returning it? Because the Juiceman I got from my local thrift store does a 100% better job. The sad thing is, it is nearly 15 years old. Sorry Jack but you need to try a bit harder."
2,Where is Escoude?,"This is easy listening gypsy music, maybe too easy. I do not find anything called versatility or technical demonstration as I've ever expected from Escoude's songs collection. I did not even recognise Escoude or any touch of jazz in this cd. Is this a way to mark a career? So disappointing."
5,Stairwell's breakthrough rock record,"Wow. As a fan of the previous album, Pacific Standard Time, I have to admit that at first I didn't know what to think about this album. It's not quite as coated with sugary emo-punk as PST is...it's more like poppy rock and roll. Several listens later, I have decided that Stairwell has grown up, and I'm happy about it. PST was great, but this album shows the boys' talent off more thoroughly. The lyrics paint more vivid pictures in my mind, the music accomplishes more...the songwriting is hitting on all cylinders; more mature cylinders, without losing any of the Stairwell fun. This is smart music.If you like indie/emo/pop but don't feel the need to suffer through something lo-fi or filled with whining singing and dissonant guitars in order to show your dedication, then I suggest this album. (To those fitting the above description, I suggest this album as well - you need it worse than we do!)"
1,What was Alex thinking?,"I don't know how these jimmys did it, but they got a record deal. I don't know who would enjoy listening to anything like this, it is so corny, backstreet boy type corny too. Please, hopefully this isn't the next boy band. Its a joke, it sounds like this CD was recorded in a bathroom. And lets just say singing isn't their strong point. The only person that could ever like this is someone from the south, or someone named Alex!"
4,Classic blues style/sound with good variety of cuts,"I am a blues fan. My tastes include Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton (From the Cradle), and old ZZ Top. This CD doesn't disappoint. I first heard the cut ""Black Cat"" on a weekly blues program on the radio. That song alone motivated me to buy this CD.I am always surprised when the remaining songs on a CD support the one most played on the radio. That was definitely the case with this one. Griffen is great on guitar and he has a great keyboard player. There is a good mix of slow blues (...fifth of whiskey and a ""Case of the Blues"") and upbeat stuff with great guitar licks. Griffen also has a good blues voice. This is his best CD, but ""Sittin' Here with Nothin'"" is good too."
2,"And NOW, for the OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY....","I'm a ""veteran"" of defragmentation software. Tested/used includes:Win9x native, McAfee's (now defunct) version, Norton SpeedDisk, Win 2k/XP native, Diskeeper 7.x series, O&O; Defrag 2000, SysInternals freeware, Diskeeper Home 9.0x, Diskeeper Professional 9.0x, and now, Raxco PerfectDisk 7.0x.I had my eye on PerfectDisk for some time. Raxco advertises that their's is ""much faster"" than Diskeeper, so I wanted to get it. I finally got it, and...WHAT A JOKE! They brag about how ""fast"" it is. It is *painfully slow* compared to Diskeeper 7x,9x (haven't tried 10x)and has a beautiful, yet OBSCURE interface that has you ""squinting"" to determine what's being done @ any given time!I've used it on Win2k sp4, WinXP sp2, and under both Intel and AMD platforms, on various drive sizes. It works S-L-O-W-L-Y in *ALL* cases!Save yourself the headache: Get Diskeeper. You can probably get a STEEP discount on 9.x, since v10 is out now. You WILL like it."
5,Truly Set It & Forget It,"After doing trial versions of a few disk defrag software, I decided to purchase full version of PerfectDisk due to price and performance. It works perfectly, no hang-ups or freeze ups, I never know it's on and it handles both a daily schedule (for routine defrag) and a weekly schedule (for intense defrag).Noticed improved performance in computer and it's more ""peace of mind"", never having to check or defrag."
5,Great product,"I have been a Diskeeper user for years, but am converted. PerfectDisk does its work less obtrusively, does a better job, and does it without occasional corruptions by virtue of the way it does the defrag."
1,Heater shuts off too quickly,The heater was fine for a few weeks but then it stopped working properly. It shuts off after 2-3 minutes of working(it is not overheating) then will not come back on for another 5-10 minutes. When it does come back on it shuts off again in 2-3 minutes time.
1,Turns off automatically,This heater turns off automatically way too fast (must be tripping overheat shut-off). Will not even run for more than 2-3 minutes at a time. It will then take about 5 minutes to cool down enough to turn back on. Go with something else unless you like your heat in extremely short bursts.
1,I was a little disturbed by his chapter on reprimanding,"I enjoyed the introduction, but the chapter on how to reprimand left me cold. I am quite disturbed by his ""paddling"" suggestions. I am thoroughly against hitting dogs so I suppose I'm one of the ""80%"" who, in his opinion, are not firm enough with their dogs. It seemed obvious to me that after his ""reprimand"" the dogs obeyed because they were afraid of him. This is not the relationship I want with my animals. This book was a mistake."
4,Birthday Present for Older Brother,The artist(s) was/were on a list that my brother had given me of CDs he wanted. I think he will like it alot.
5,"This is a book of songs only--there is no prose, etc. in this book!","I'm giving this book five stars because it is a songbook of Shawn's music, which is great. But I am very annoyed with the review of this book on this page that claims that this book is filled with poetic verse, short stories, detective fiction, etc. Is that person on drugs? I bought the book based on that review and turns out it is simply a music book for piano and guitar of Shawn's songs. Nothing more. And no one except this one daffy reviewer portended that it was anything else. I wish Amazon would remove that review as it is completely misleading and totally false."
2,Christmas Presence,I really don't like the CD that much. I purchased it because I heard one song on the radio and thought it would be a pretty good CD. But I don't like it at all. Only that one song that I purchased it for. I could have just downloaded that one song. Next time I know.
5,A timeless jazz/vocal album...,"I must admit I have this on lp, and prefer it in that format(I'm only 28 yrs. old too!), there is just such a warmer tone on lp, especially when listening to the warmest voice in jazz, backed by the coolest pianist. But whatever format you prefer this is a classic jazz/vocal album with Torme's smooth vocals swingin' gently atop Shearing's bright piano playing. This album is sizzling hot, especially the opener ""Shine on Your Shoes"", the whole album is steamin' even the ballads are sizzlin'. This pair made a lot of albums together, but this one is the ONLY essential one!!!(though they are all good). For those of us who hunt thrift shops in search of George Shearing Quintet albums like ""Mood Latino"" and ""Latin Escapade"", there isn't much afro-cuban jazz here, and it's neat to hear Shearing just plain swingin' on the keys. These two guys have a mutual admiration for each others artistry, and it is apparent on this awesome cd/lp!!!"
1,horrible,the whole top of the book looks like its been wet n dried the pages are messed up and not worth wat i paid for it
4,Great deal while it lasted!,"I ordered and received the model off the Philips outlet store $999 - $200 discount which I consider a very good deal. The set arrived quickly and in good condition.None of the accessories other than a stand were included (ac cord, remote control, cables and wall mount) with the original shipment. A call to Phillips customer support got a quick response that they will send the items as the become available. The ac cord arrived in two days with a packing slip stating stand and remote are back-ordered. The wall mount is not available, but I would want a tilting one if I were to wall mount.The stand they shipped originally was for a much bigger tv.If Philips comes thru with their promise I will remain happy.I will echo the statements by other customers. This is not the ideal hdtv (picture, connections, etc.) but an excellent set for $800."
1,Dont get in to this units,I did get a TV from this seller and the TV was Scratched in many areas. Please Pay Attention
4,Ordered the Wrong One . . . But kept it anyway!,"Was looking for the FEMALE version of Neil Simon's hit, but ended up with the original. Came in record time, excellent condition, and a really funny work, so I kept it. The mistake was mine . . . but it turned out great anyway! :)"
3,"The Odd Couple, Female Version","The book was fine, but I was completely dissatisfied with the shipping. I paid for expedited shipping and it took 9 days to arrive! I finally resorted to a hard search (with the help of a very kind librarian) of every library in Dallas, Richardson and Plano to find a copy of the book. One day after finding it at a library almost 30 minutes away, your book arrived. I expected that ""expedited shipping"" would be considerably faster. I will not purchase from this seller again."
3,"Well, it didn't work for me.","I tried this product during my second trimester and didn't like it. It was too simple and repetitive for me. I would maybe benefit more if I tried again during my third trimester when I have no energy. Nevertheless, I really like Tracy Mallet. I will be using her 6 minute DVDs for returning back to my pre-pregnancy weight after the delivery."
2,terrible,"Horrible cueing. The segments for 1/2nd trimester had the host doing first trimester and the other girl doing second, but more often than not would not show the 2nd trimester girl. The was frequent cueing without instruction (""tilt""...tilt what? and since the camera is only shoulder up I can't tell what you are tilting!). In general, the camera angles did not allow you to view form effectively. There are many other prenatal vidoes that offer the same thing but in a more effective manner."
4,Challenging,I found this DVD motivating and challenging. The routines are not boring. It helped contribute to me having a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Plus there's a bonus segment for postpartum exercise.
4,Lovely Music,"My 4 year old daughter LOVES this CD. Although we are just now getting past the dog-days of Summer, she listens to it every night as she falls asleep. It is the perfect addition to our Christmas music collection.Leland Dent is a talented musician, and I look forward to his new music..."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have a different MP3 from this company, but I need to warn anybody considering a purchase from Digitalway. My MP3 failed within 6 weeks - customer service is impossible to get a hold of, even more difficult to understand than the User Manual, and unwilling to send the return/repair forms. The 120 day warranty is worthless."
4,Great MP3!,"This thing works great w/ a MAC. Very easy to use. Just plug it in a USB port and it shows up in your ITunes library section. Simply drag tunes from anywhere onto the player icon and you're set. Right click to remove songs from your list. It's just that easy! I can get about thirty songs this thing and the battery seems to last about 8 hours or so - not bad for one aaa.The only drawback os the belt clip. It's a little unstable for running or working out.I highly recommend this player if you have a MAC and need something to take on a run or to the gym. It's lighweight, durable and very easy to use.Did a lot of research before buying an MP3 and was a little hesitant because there were not a lot of customer reviews on this one but I took a gamble and am very satisfied."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I have the Whispers cd that Baby Face produced and I wasexpecting the anthology to be better. I was sadly mistakenthis cd is not worth the price and If I could this wouldbe returned. I can't say I have ever been so diaappointed.Willing to trade for something else, but I can't send thisto anyone and have clear concious."
5,Best of the Best,Any Whispers fan would love this collection; anyone that hasn't followed the Whispers wouldn't have a clue about the precious memories and legendary tracks that are contained herein. One of the best groups to sing on this planet. Anything that comes out of their mouths is worth listening to.
4,Great cartoon to relive your youth,One of the best cartoons out there that came out of the 80's This cartoon rocks. It ranks up there with transformers and g.i. joe. It talks about a western civilization in the future that has a sheriff that is an indian and can call upon animals for their strengths and ability. Classic good vs. evil.
2,Do not like it,"I have loved the Effinger Four Pastorales for many years and recently conducted them in a concert. Hearing this large group of loud, vibrato-laden singers sing these profound works without any regard for musicality was very difficult. I have a recording of the St. Martin Choir from Colorado singing these pieces, and it is divine. I do not recommend this recording to anyone who is musical!"
5,Personal writing for abuse survivors used as a healing tool.,"This book is about what happens when the abuse stops. A person may be safe but still not feel safe. There may be overwhelming fear, guilt, or sadness that has to be expressed somehow in order to heal. Dr. Taliaferro's book shows how personal writing can be a big part of that process. The book is easy to follow and has some wonderful exercises. It's warm, positive, and looks toward the future. Highly recommended."
5,Valuable Book to Help Steer You Out of Abusive Relationships,"I love Dr. T's book. As a person with abuse in my past, the book really spoke to me. Before I read the book, there was so much of my life that I had blocked out due to the pain of confronting the abuse.I realized that it was time to remember who I was and stop being afraid. The exercises in the book served as the perfect vehicle for helping me to discover and explore many of my old beliefs that kept me a victim. The book validated me and helped me to understand that I chose to be a victim long after the abuse. Now I am a survivor. I make choices based on having a conscious awareness and not based on old patterns of behavior. This book is a Godsend! Thank you, Dr. T."
1,ouch! this could make even ME a yankees fan!,"this book kept getting delayed for nearly two years, and i had thought it was to make sure it would be thorough and correct. boy, was i ever wrong!this is a total disaster. just a cursory reading and i noticed a dozen factual errors. i mean: listing billy taylor among the all-time season saves leaders? thats only symptomatic of the shoddy workmanship that went into this book. any longtime mets fan (and ive been there since the beginning) would be able to do a better job than this.do NOT go near this outrageously overpriced pile of dross! it is as valuable to a mets fan as -- well, as kevin mcreynolds!BOO! HISS!"
4,"After a Long Wait, It's Finally Here!",Finally! I have been waiting and waiting forever for this to come out! Now I am glad it did! It is not a bad encyclopedia but I would have liked it to be more acurate.
4,Walker's Crossing,"Walker's Crossing was The best book I have Ever read. Usually when I read a book, I get bored and I don't finish the book. When I read Walker's Crossing, I read the book. I was very interested in the book. I used to want to be a cowboy when I was younger.When Lon Walker got hurt,I thought it was cool that Gil Walker and Ryan Walker helped out on the Ranch.If I was a girl, I would want to be a Junior Rodeo Queen too.Charlene never gave up.I learned alot about what cowboys really do on a Ranch.I urge everyone in the world to read Walker's Crossing. It's a great book."
3,Actual Product Review,"This is a review about the product, not the company's fix it policy or my exciting trip. However I can make it short and sweet for you.This product will act as a glorified talking dictionary with 20 languages. Similar to a dictionary you must input words individually however if you are getting this product for more general purposes it does come with a common phrase data base.The talking part of this dictionary is not great either. However, if you are a fan of listening to Stephen Hawkings voice then you will love the speach of this dictionary. This means that the recorded voice is robotic in nature which does not bode well with asian languages that revolve around fluxuation."
1,total junk,"This product is a joke. The spoken words are unrecognizable in Russian. I took it with me to Russia recently, tried it on the plane and that was the last time it came out of the box. I had to use a regular old paper travel dictionary with english pronunciation. This lingo machine is computer talking at it's worst. Too fast to understand, etc. etc. I can't even bother to write more - just don't waste your money if you want a translator that helps you hear and speak the Russian language - this one won't do it."
1,Not worth the money,I was completely disappointed in this translator. The audio was unintelligible. I sent it back.
2,Really cheap,i bought these shoes and three days later i could already see the leather strectching and starting becoming very loose and stretched out and didnt last long at all
3,Original works are fresh; everything else stale,"Use of Buddhist imagery is very common (repetitive).I hope this author publishes more of her own work, free from all of Rumi's and Buddha's and everyone else's influences."
2,Disappointed,"This mp3 player functioned without any problems when I first got it. But after two months all of my files got erased even though both the player and program said my memory had been taken up. I had to format the internal memory, and reupload my files. The files would often freeze whenever I tried to upload them or delete them from the player. This player is a hassle to maintain."
2,looks very nice but it is useless,"I bought it because it looked nice and because it uses Smart Cards, but it is a flop. The menu is impossible to navigate, the manual not helpful at all, and the software that comes with it is basically useless. The manufacturer does not offer the patches required to make it work with Windows XP. The letters on the screen are hard to read. Good sound and the FM radio included is a good feature, but it is not worth the hassle of going through the installation. The buttons are confusing, too many functions in too few buttons. The remote control is even harder to use.After trying to instal it in a brand-new laptop I gave up and had to return it. Why not paying a bit more and getting a hard drive memory MP3 player with several GB that will allow one to store tons of music...that's what I did and bought a Zen NX Jukebox with 20 GB. I transferred all the music I had in my 7 128 MB SmartCards and still have over 17 GB to go!"
5,mad nice mp3 player,"this is a beautiful mp3 player. simply beautiful. the backlights on the body and remote control are outstanding. the 128 megabytes gave me a lot of room for lots of music. the sleek, silver, futurisic design rocks. overall, there is nothing wrong with this"
2,"Food may be certified organic, but package isn't",I have to agree with the other reviewer that the package does not seem consistent with the contents. I'm not taking any chances on plastic in the microwave. I'll stick with Earth's Best.
5,It's about time this one came out!!!!!,Somehow I lost my only copie of this sometime in the eighties.. Finally it's realease on cd has made me happy again.. The best skinhead rock and roll ever!!!!
5,liberalssuck83,this is the best american backstreet oi album since the anti heros forgotten heroes so all you libby punk/united skins can kiss my a** cause you aint even close to working class street kids
5,Definatly does the trick,"This will split trough fur knots and/or cut them off, just make sure you don't slip or your finger, or the animal will be hurt.Keep away from children for sure."
3,Be Aware,"Please be aware! The cover of this item will lead you to believe that you can hook up 4 Game Goy Advanced consoles at one time. In reality, this link only allows 2 players to link and another link is required for 4 players."
3,Love Ancient Aliens,Very informative I always watch this on TV...really makes you think about things...I was brought up Catholic and we were told it is sinful to question God...well I am finally getting some of my questions answered at age 70! It's never to late...
5,Brilliant!,"By far the best of the serious books on this fascinating subject. Superb writing, excellent literary analysis, deep psychological insights. Far better than the usual explanations/explorations offered by psychologists and therapists. Ms. Phillips nails it!"
3,Thought provoking,"This book does provoke lots of ideas and is generous in its attitude to alternative sexualities and lifestyles. She's good on gender and the sex war and what male and female mean. It's not easy to read and I didn't understand everything and it's not to be taken as gospel. Like another reviewer said, it's a personal view."
3,Better than Coleman,"great at splitting up the gas supply but now the problem is finding place to put the propane tank, at 6-5 would prefer taller pole or easy place to set propane tank"
5,Great Product,"Purchased this to use on an annual week long camping trip. Distribution post was as described and worked great. I really liked the way it mounted to the LP tank. With a hose going from the connection to the post it allows you to mount the post to the top of the tank without putting any pressure on the tank valve itself. Used a lantern, 2 burner camp stove, and an instant water heater simultaneously with no problems. There were no leaks and unit felt solid when assembled. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to save money or just doesn't like changing out the 16.4 oz propane cylinders."
1,Will NOT work with Lite Cylinders!,"I CANNOT RATE THIS PRODUCT!I purchased a Century two-piece safety post that was delivered last week; it was checked and found it was all that I expected from a Century product. At that time I also ordered the Lite ten pound propane cylinder (LC-10-30), but delivery was delayed and it did not come until today.Upon attempting to marry the two units, to make it into a distribution post to attach the lantern and the camp stove, I found to my dismay that there is no way for the units to mate.Evidently, the Century unit can only attach to the neck of a steel cylinder. There is absolutely no way that the distribution tree can attach to the Lite cylinder's plastic rim. And it cannot stand upon its own, even if the base was a little longer.And in all probability there is nothing that can be done with each of them but to go back to the one-pound propane bottles.But amazingly, Amazon did not alert its customers that the two products are incompatible."
3,Made in China,They may all be made in china but you really can tell this one was. Threads are a bit rough but seals are good. It works.
1,Leaks,I have the one piece version. Upon second use the device leaks propane where the top outlet connects to the tube. I could feel the gas shooting out the side so fotunately I did not use it in this condition.Since I did not save the receipt the one year warranty is useless. The manufacturer wanted to charge me $25.00 to inspect the product plus $12.50 return shipping (plus my shipping to them). Way over the price of a new one.I bought a different brand to replace it.
4,Interesting view of film festivals,Great articles about the fests. You can tell that there is knowledge to back up the passion in the writing.
1,I like to name drop and tell stories...,"By Raoul Felder should be the title of this book.I like stories from professionals who have been there and done that. This guy is over the top though, he includes _a lot_ of stories that have almost no bearing. I wish I read the reviews before I bought the book.Also, he name drops consistently through out the book. This takes up like 25 pages. For example, in the 180s he restates that Rudy Guliani was the mayor of NYC. Ummmmm most people in the post 9/11 US know this. Thanks for the courtesy intro the first time but there is no need for it each and every time.I would say there is about 50 pages of info spread out over 250 pages. Probably a must read for divorce lawyers only. This book is a waste for normal people.Sean"
1,A Walk Down Enquirer Lane,"If you want to learn anything about negotiating DO NOT read this book. Seems to represent stories that Mr. Felder tells at coctail parties and the audience there tired of them. The content is more like a walk down ""The Enquirer"" memory lane and has little or nothing to do with negotiating."
4,"""Master of Give-and-Take"" is right","Raoul Felder deftly sorts through the wreckage of his many high-profile cases to come up with this invaluable stuff (and it's funny, too.) The section on nonverbal communication is particluarly useful. I would recommend to anyone looking to improve their hardball game."
5,A superb collection...,"Outstanding collection of short stories!I bought this book after reading only a few reviews and it paid off. ""Controlled Burn"" is one of the best short story collections I've read in awhile.The book has thirteen stories, all worth reading!After reading the first two stories, I felt the writing was great, but the stories were slow and very humble. Once you hit the third story ""El Rey"", the book never looks back and every story gets better and better.Meth dealers, boxers, fugitives, alcoholics, fathers, sons, gangs, bounty hunters, dogs - their all here in ""Controlled Burn"".A few that really blew me away -CrankBall Lightning ReportedAtomic SupernovaThe Copper KingsVigilanceA great collection, if you enjoy short stories, this book is a must read!If you read ""Controlled Burn"" and enjoyed it, also check out ""Poachers"" by Tom Franklin & ""The Hotel Eden"" by Ron Carlson, both amazing books of short stories."
4,Dark and gritty,"If you like your short stories gritty and noir, then you will not be disappointed with this collection. I had never heard of Wolven until I ran across his short story Controlled Burn in another collection of stories and liked it enough to try some more. My only complaint is that Wolven was relatively young when he wrote these, and his limited life experience shows through in places. I'll be looking for more from him though."
3,Obviously a gifted writer...,"Many of these stories are strong and depict harder, tougher characters than the ones I'm used to reading. Wolven plumbs deeply into unseemly lives and desperate situations, never afraid of being a bit too dark or bleak. I appreciated his fearlessness. The strongest stories like ""El Rey,"" ""Outside Work Detail,"" ""Controlled Burn"" and ""Atomic Supernova"" offer the reader provocative characters, dangerous atmospheres, breathless tension, remarkable authenticity and more than a couple of surprises. That said, other stories in the collection begin to feel repetitive and superfluous; stories like ""The High Iron,"" ""The Rooming House"" and both Red Green stories just rework the same themes and situations that Wolven explores with more success and wholeness in the stronger stories. By the end of the collection, I got the fact that Wolven can write about men on the wrong side of the law better than most writers. I just wanted to see what else he could do."
1,Not What I Expected,"The characters are weak, the dialogue is weak and the plots are so-so. However, he writes well style-wise. Overall, a disappointment."
3,Interesting but could be better written,"I read this book as we were visiting Newfoundland so I was interested in the topic. I also read another of Earl Pilgrim's books which was well written so I couldn't understand why ""Will anyone search for Danny?"" was poorly written. Perhaps it was the author's first book and he hadn't yet developed as a writer. In many places he not only shows you Danny's emotion but then explicitly tells you as well which I found jarring. However, the book does give you an insight into life in Newfoundland many years ago."
4,Richly Layered Music,"Opsvik and Jennings have created a rich tapestry of music here. Each track weaves together a myriad of electronic sounds with a variety of guitar sounds. They have seamlessly woven together twangy accoustic guitars, banjos, hawaiian slide guitar parts with electronica. The end result is something that sounds like mix between psychadellic pop (e.g. Pink Floyd Circa 1968 w/o vocals) and a John Cage prepared piano piece. The electronic sounds give it a post modern finish. There is not really any soloing on the album, so you can't really call this a jazz CD. To put this CD in any genre would be a difficult task. The overall mood of the CD is ambient and surrealistic. If you're a fan of the Rune Grammofon label, you should pick this one up."
1,Horrible,"When I saw this product online I thought it would be pretty awsome to get it off amozon, but that was a huge,horrible,bad, mistake I made! When the flim came I put in my izone camra and got ready to take my first picture! When I did it took like 5 min. to get the stupid flim to turn up. When the picture was finished I noticed there was 3 things wrong with this picture. One thing wrong was that I couldn't tell who I took a picture of at all. Two was that the color was all faded, and It was not really bright at all. The last problem was that after I took another picture it was totally blank, and yellow! I recommend getting the Polaroid i-Zone Sticky Pocket Film! I recommend this film because it has no blank pictures, tons of color, and you can autually tell who is the person in the picture! I hope my review was helpful to you, and please do not buy the Fortune teller film even if it looks cool beleive me I had the experience!:)"
2,I didn't enjoy this book at all,Well written but boring. I think watching paint dry would be more entertaining than reading this book. I never made it to the end.
1,Excruciating,"Put me out of my misery now.The only good think about this books is that i learned a new word - omphaloskeptic; which is what Anais Nin is. Seriously lady, get a job and stop analyzing your emotions, they are really not at all interesting."
5,A simply beautiful book!,"This diary is a true, well written account about a fascinating time in the life of Anais Nin. If you've never read Anais before, this is a great book to start with, especially for anyone who's a fan of Henry Miller, the decade of the thirties, and anything Paris. Her day-to-day accounts of her thoughts are an enlightening look at a life most of us only can only dream of living."
5,Great reading.,"Having read Delta of Venus, I wanted more Anais Nin and decided on this one. It's great. I liked it better than the first and that's because it deals with the love affair between her and Henry Miller and, of course, his wife, June. While some might think it's a bit stogy, I really enjoyed it for the prose and intense romance between them. I highly recommend this one, along withDelta of Venus."
2,It's alright,"The main thing to remember about this book is that it is a journal. So if you are looking for a beginning, middle and end you won't find it here. I kind of felt like ""what is the point?"" after I read it. It was also hard for me to understand how Anais Nin could write all these words of love about Henry Miller. I tried to read Miller's TROPIC OF CAPRICORN but I had to stop because he is such a misogynistic jerk. I couldn't believe the feelings of hate he had towards his poor first wife, and the way that he saw all women as trash. I had a hard time not thinking that Anais Nin was crazy to risk her marriage to a wonderful man for a horrible man like Miller. This is not a great book, but the one good thing about it is that it is very sensual and erotic."
1,CUT,"The above mentioned running time of 107 minutes (which would be the correct length for the US version, according to IMDB) ist NOT correct! It runs only 95 minutes and 42 seconds.I dumped it. I do not watch cut films."
4,Finally a book for truly older law students,"Not all law students go straight from high school, to undergrad, to law school. Some take a different road -- raising children and/or trying different careers before making the leap to go to law school.This book gives tips and ancedotes from those who have made the journey. It's an easy read and gives a different perspective than some of the other law school books.I'd recommend it for those who are older and planning to go to law school and want to read how others have handled the experience."
1,A waste of time,"I read this book along with Montauk's to get a better understanding of how the application process works for law school and how to prepare my family for the transition. Montauk's book is amazing and is a great guide through the entire process of applying to law school. However, this book was a complete waste of time. Every page has a first person testimonial that is just a repeat of what the author just stated in the previos paragraph. Testimonials should show the application of the principles laid out by the author. This is literally a bunch of warrantless claims. Remove the testimonials out and you got a 50 page booklet. In addition, the book reads like a ""I'm ok, you're ok"" speech. Throwing a title on a book that implies that you will provide insight to the older applicant and student is great way to sell some books, I applaude the authors marketing skills."
2,Simplifying a horrific journey.......,"The symptoms of Early Onset Bipolar are covered in this book, however it is over-simplified how the child is diagnosed and the course of treatment. This book portrayed a child ""crab"" who was hospitalized, medicated and back to school with little difficulty. It did mention the families trauma but made it seem so short lived. Having a bipolar child that has been hospitalized three times and on at least 20 different medications, I am disappointed that this is such an unfair portrayal of the journey. Being a member of a support group with at least 16 parents who have had similar stories as mine, can tell you that the journey does not end so happily ever after and this story would be a confusing message to send to our children."
5,Helping Children Understand Mental Illness,"I have adoped two children with mental health problems and am always looking for ways to help the children and their frinds understand Bipolar.Matt the Moody Hermit Crab, tells this story in a way that children (and adults) can understand how the world seems from the family and ill child feels living with this illness 24/7.I would recommend this book to anyone that knows someone with bipolar and wants to better understand the illness.My 12 and 7 years old really enjoyed the book and were better able to understand their illnes.We plan on buying a copy of this book for the school library.The author is a mother of a child who has to live with this illnes 24/7 and was able to tell this story in a way that only a person living with this illnes could. I am glad to be able to know this author if only through the internet and her wisdom on the support group we belong too.The cover attracts attention and the drawing inside are wonderful."
5,An Appreciative Grandmother,"Thank you, Caroline, for opening my eyes...and my heart...to what has been/is going on with my 11 year old grandson. I thought I understood the struggle within my daughter's family, but your simply told story clarified so much.I wish I had known all this years ago.Can we invite Matt to be the guest speaker at all first-of-the-year faculty meetings world-wide?"
5,Superb guide for beginner/intermediate photographer,"Despite that I'm losing a fair chunk of change on Kodak in the stock market, and that this book touts Kodak film, it remains one of the BEST all-time books for beginner/intermediate photographers!This gem of a book explains in easy language all the basics one needs to learn - exposure (shutter speed, f-stops, ISO), lenses, composition, filters, flash and taking pictures in different lighting situations (daylight, backlight, sidelight etc.)Although some may think this book is ""dated"" because it does not address the digital realm, it will remain a classic for teaching the basic, unchanging principles of photography.Highly recommended!!!"
1,The song I bought it for isn't even on there.,"I bought this CD based on the version of one of the songs I saw on youtube. It was gorgeous, ran for 6 mins and was haunting and purely instrumental. I bought the whole CD for $28 for that song. As far as I can tell, that version isn't on the CD, anywhere. One version has some guy whispering all through it and another has tinkling piano and an opera singer. I am so disappointed and a bit p-ed off. Had to listen to everything incase the version I wanted was hidden in amongst the other stuff but I didn't find it. I wish I could find the version I fell in love with and was willing to blow $30 on. I am never buying a CD again unless I KNOW the song I want, in the version I want, is on there."
1,"Lacking qualities that excite, stimulate, or interest","Go to a local bar and hear as good or better....Great thing most of the cd you can download, so its free."
1,You have not heard this all before???,"Yes! well arranged and instruments played well!If i want great guitar i listen to Keith Richards.great sonwriting???Please you make people turn in their grave.Nothing really new,news. sorry to break anyones bubble.5 stars for over all effort."
5,Good Product,I use this product on a 2005 F150 truck and a 2008 Nissan Altima. The adapter worked perfectly for both. I did not put the brake fluid in the bleeder. I removed as much of the old brake fluid as I could with a turkey broaster. Then I filled the master cylinder to almost the top with new brake fluid. Then I pumped the bleeder up to between 13 - 14 pounds. Then I bleed each wheel. The first time took about 30 minutes for the F150. The Nissan took longer because I needed to remove the wheels. I have never bleed brakes before and this made it an easy job.
3,A couple problems but OK,Product arrived with glass broken on air pressure gauge. The manufacturer's packaging isn't sufficient to protect the product in shipping (seller shipping packaging was fine).The Ford reservoir adapter's rubber o-ring was too big; it would snag the sides when trying to push the adapter down on the reservior. Replaced it with one size smaller and now it works fine.
4,Not perfect,This is the best one-person brake bleeding tool that I have found. Will leak at the adapter connections if not tightened hard enough.
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This thing works great. I had no problems using it. Really simple to use, and I am very impressed with the product. One thing, get some teflon tape to coat the male connector because the joint leaked a little, but other than that. GREAT PRODUCT"
4,Pump it UP,"This item allowed me to skip the Ford Stealership PLUS I saved money bleeding the brakes myself.The 1998 Ford E350 brake system would not bleed using the pump the pedal method.Easy to use and well made.I had to replace the O-ring supplied for the Ford brake fluid resivor, the one supplied was too thick for the application."
4,Five stars if they had included a longer bleed tube...,"I bought this to flush and bleed the brakes on a couple of Ford trucks. It worked quite well but the inclusion of an 8"" tube to connect at the bleed nippple is comically inadequate. I considered returning it just to make a point, but a better solution is to buy a 2 foot length of clear 3/8"" tube the next time I visit a hardware store..."
2,"Without Doug Dillard, it sure ain't the best of the Darlings","This pointless compilation, culled from the Dillards last two studio albums, is for completists only. (That's the only reason I own it.) Five of the albums nine measly tracks are from the disappointing ""Take Me Along for the Ride,"" with only four songs from the vastly superior ""Let It Fly.""This was obviously a hastily produced project, with no liner notes whatsoever. Being a compilation of 1990s-era Dillards, the title and cover (the original Dillards as the stoical Darling clan) are extremely misleading. Fans who have lost touch with the band, and are expecting to hear the kind of lean, mean bluegrass the boys played on ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" are duly warned to stay away.If you DO fancy neo-Dillards trying their hand at contemporary country music, skip this one and buy the superb ""Let It Fly"" instead. You won't regret it."
3,IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.,"THE TRACKS ON THIS DISK ARE VERY GOOD. I LIKE THE SOUND. BUT THE TITLE IS MISLEADING. THERE ARE NO CUTS DONE BY THE DARLINGS, PER SAY, FROM THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, BUT IT'S STILL A GOOD SOUND."
2,not what I wanted...,"As a fan of the ancient sitcom ""The Andy Griffith Show"",I ordered this CD thinking that the songs included would be those with which I was familiar. To the contrary, not one single Dillard'ss tune I knew was included! I would suggest to Amazon to detail a listing of songs on a given CD...so you'll know what you're getting. I wouldn't have ordered the CD if I had known it was completely unfamiliar music. ""Best of..."" indicates familiar songs!On the other hand, since I like the Dillards generally speaking, I've found in listening to the CD that I do like some of the songs, thus it's not a total loss.I do feel as if the product was misrepresented."
1,WHOOPS!,"I purchased this CD under the assumption that it would have music from the Andy Griffith Show. WHOOPS!!! Big mistake on my part. I should have read the other reviews. You will here some good music on this CD, just not anything from the AG Show. The CD should be retitled and also have a new picture for it's cover. This was a big disappointment."
1,M S Sandoval,"I bought this CD they said they had plenty, I paid for it and later they said they canceled my order cause they didn't have any more. I don't know where my money is and they never responded after I e-mailed Them. A bit of warning with this vendor I give them a F rating maybe an F+ I wouldn't recommend them. ****Buyer Beware****.."
3,somewhat overrated,"i have to say i'm rather disappointed in this disc, gibbons' playing is good but the album as a whole is quite derivative- you can tell the band were just kids. there's an interesting non-lp version of i want to hold your hand included.pluto september 31st is also good , though it rips off jimi hendrix's fire. there's some competent vocals from gibbons, and the second part of flashback is fine, but overall the album is just not that impressive. zz top fans might enjoy some of this since gibbons is a really fine blues guitarist but other than that it is really just a curio from the late 60's-and an overrated one at that."
2,Fun Espionage Thriller,"It's no classic, but Karloff fans will like this ""B"" picture full of twists and turns as you try to figure out just who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.Best of all it's short and to the point. A virtue that Hollywood seems to be lacking these days."
4,British Intelligence...,"I knew that this was a 'B' movie when I purchased it. But with Boris Karloff as the lead character, I knew that this effort wasn't a total loss. I was right! This story had enough in it in the matter of twists and turns to force me to pay attention - the ending was quite surprising (I should tell you - but I won't!!). The price is right! If you want to be entertained, and don't mind 'B' movies, then may I suggest this one?Four stars for Boris Karloff and British Intelligence!"
4,From a book club,"I recently joined a new book club with my local museum. I am planning on being a teacher and thought it would be could to give this book club a dry run before I am in a classroom. This is the book I selected to read.It had a nice pace. I enjoyed the author's choice of volleying between two time periods having both stories converge. Although this was a fictional read, I felt like I was right there in Africa on a dig. The author included many modern day issues political, professional and personal. I also felt like I was right there millions of years ago watching a story play out. As you read, you think that maybe we are not so different from our ancestors afterall. It was a fun escape."
4,A compelling tale of modern and prehistorical times,"This is a story about two girls, Li and Vinny, who live in twovery different times. The stories cross in that Vinny andher father are working on an archeological dig at the site of theinland sea that Li knew thousands of years before.Anthor great story from Peter Dickinso"
2,Interesting ideas about our ancestors...,"There are really two, very parallel, stories told in this book, and they are only separated by a couple of million years. In the present, a young teenager named Vinny has convinced her mother to let her spend summer vacation with her father in Africa. Her father, Sam, is working in an archeological site in Africa without much success. Vinny turns out to be his good luck charm. Flip back to the past and we see a teenager called Li that is half-ape, half-human that thinks way beyond her time. Each chapter goes back and forth between past and present. A couple of times I was lost in the paleontology talk and the present storyline was a bit boring, but I liked the author's way of describing the past storyline."
3,Not Bad But...,"So I'm sitting here wondering about what I loved about this book and what I hated about it. The plot moves swiftly and the suspense is well painted throughtout making the reader move fast from page to page, as a suspense novel it's great as a horror novel it falls short and I'm not to sure what Ira Levin was aiming for. The ending leaves a lot to be desired but after reading it your not exactly kicking yourself for doing so due to the fact it isn't a huge book to read, the ending although a little weak does not detract altogether from this book cause it's still a good book, but it isn't for those searching for edge of your seat stuff, this is a suspenseful thriller and the ending wasn't gripping enough for me to run out and buy the sequel THE SON OF ROSEMARY, those of you who are looking for a suspense with more chilling results should look to the EXORCIST. As for Rosemarys Baby it reaches for the above average score and holds it firmly."
3,Pretty good read until the lame ending,"While there is no way that ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a literary masterpiece, I genuinely enjoyed reading this book until Part 3. Parts 1 and 2 clipped along at a nice pace (although some parts dragged a bit), and generally held my attention. The conclusion of the book, however, sucked. When Rosemary goes from horror, shock and disbelief to acceptance in a matter of a few paragraphs (well, I guess my son being the son of Satan isn't so bad after all!!!!!) the book lost me. A better ending would have been to throw the baby out the window (which Rosemary actually considered) because it would have avenged everything the witches had done to Rosemary throughout the book. Instead, we get her lame acceptance of her freakish offspring, which smacked of a cop-out on Levin's part. Other than that, though, the book was entertaining. Not deep, just entertaining."
4,A minimalist novel,"I read this book when it first came out, when it was a bestseller. I enjoyed it then, but had a snobby attitude that only Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Faulkner existed as writers at that time, being young and supremely critical about everything. I still don't think it's a work of great genius, but it has a minimalist style that is very clear and never waivers in its ""voice."" Levin is definitely a master of this. And with his short, concise sentences, he builds the suspense. The book is a creepy, guilty pleasure. The film, by Polanski, is true to the book except, as another reviewer has said here, for the ending, which would have made the movie even better, I think. I listened to the audio book with Mia Farrow reading. Perfect. If you haven't heard it, check it out. It's lots of fun."
5,In Love with Levin...,"Years ago I read The Boys From Brazil also written by Ira Levin and loved it. This is another great book from a master story teller. There is tension and suspense throughout, even though we all know the outcome. As soon as I was finished with this book, I watched the movie, which, as another reviewer stated, does follow the book, verbatim. Both were excellent. What I love about Ira Levin's writing, is that he doesnt go off on tangents. Every word he writes is important. A very talented writer. A Kiss Before Dying is also a masterpiece which I highly recommend."
5,A good plain tale.,"Horror stories are best when they creep up on you. It is not necessary to resort to gutwrenchingly gross images or so much as spin your head around. Horror is about primordial feelings and emotions. Shirley Jackson knew about this. Here, Ira Levin takes an age-old idea -- the mother pregnant through supernatural means -- and puts a modern spin on it. We are drawn in so subtly that we think we're reading a plain novel, but the hints are scattered all through. We come to understand the nature of Rosemary's pregnancy long before Rosemary begins to suspect that anything is untoward. And when she does learn the truth about her neighbours, she jumps to an understandable erroneous conclusion that ensures the coven's success. We are left to wonder: do they ever actually perform the ceremonies that Rosemary fears? Brilliant. Read this, see the movie (closely based on the book) and leave ""Son of Rosemary"" quite alone."
2,What a dreary read,"I was so looking forward to reading this book and now that I have, I wasted my time. The plot was weak as was the development of the characters, especially that of Rosemary. I don't dare read the sequel."
5,Ira Levin is Awesome,Superbly suspenseful. My cat jumped on the bed while I was reading a particularly exciting passage and I almost had a heart attack.
4,Classic,I wanted to read this book after since watching the movie so many times and for it to explain on some unfinished scenes that made no sense but did after reading this book.
3,Only O.K.,"The entire first half of this book drags. They move in, meet the neighbors, and try to have a baby. It also becomes incredibly apparent that Rosemary herself is an idiot. Her refusal to see reason makes her scenes frustrating to read. The suspense is not totally nonexistent however. It comes in subtle drops along the way. When Hutch begins to suspect Rosemary's neighbors of being more than what they claim, the plot speeds up considerably. I found myself reading what I thought would turn out to be a pretty good book after all, when it ended. This is not a well thought out conclusion and it is not at all satisfying. The subject matter and the midsection were so good that if the ending was handled with more care and Rosemary had more sense, I would have excused the slow start and jumped the rating up a star."
4,Quick Read,"This is an extremely fast read. You could easily read this book in one sitting especially if you've seen the movie. To me having seen the movie actually makes the book better, which is rare. Actually knowing what the ending is makes you hate the antagonist even more and really see how manipulating they are. if you haven't seen the movie then you will question whether the mother is just going crazy and making everything up. it's really not an horror story until the last 20 pages or so but the overall story is entertaining enough to keep you attached to the characters for 200 pages."
3,Rosemary's Baby,I did not find this book very interesting. It did not scare me and I was not surprised at the ending. I felt I wasted my time reading this book.
5,"""Hail Rosemary! Hail Satan!""","This book is a modern horror masterpiece put together in a way like no other horror book I've ever read. Creativity and style are the keys to the success of the story. At all times the reader has the sense that some sort of dark conspiracy is afoot, but at the same time, there is just enough lack of evidence that one can just dismiss it as silliness and paranoia. This tension lasts right up until the end of the story. Minor inconsistencies and eerie neighbors leave the reader constantly guessing and struggling with what is really going on. Yet every time a strange event happens, there seems to be an equally logical explanation that allays the newly arisen suspicion. That is the greatness of this book. The story is so well put together that the reader can struggle, but will not figure out the true scope of everything that is happening until the author wants him to. This is a very worthwhile, scary read. The movie starring Mia Farrow is also plenty creepy!"
3,Book vs movie,"It is amazing to me that Mr. Levin's novel--his second book--was translated to film almost word for word by Polanski. This popular novel beautifully skewers actors (so desperate to succeed that they would literally trade their first born to the devil for a competitive edge) and presents a very New York version of life which still might still be true today (location, location, location, even if it requires selling your soul and/or wife and child). Knowing the outcome and anticipating the ending after having seen the film numerous times I still got wrapped up in Rosemary's paranoia as she tries to figure out the conspiracy against her unborn baby and strives to protect him or her from the Satinists... lovely plot twist."
5,Just As Good the Second Time!,"I read Rosemary's Baby in the late sixties and also saw the movie. When a special offer came from Amazon for the Kindle version, I thought I would read it again. Mr. Levin used such excellent description that I felt I was right there along with the characters. I quickly remembered some of the forgotten details and was sad to have the book come to an end. I have always liked horror stories and think this is one of the best ever. The new TV series this fall, 666 Park Avenue, has been compared to Rosemary's Baby. I am anxious to see if it can live up to this spell-binding story!"
4,Still Chilling after all These Years,I was pleasantly surprised by how well Rosemary's Baby stood the test of time. It is a low key horror story by a great writer. I can definitely recommend this book.
4,Never had read this before,"This was creepy, scary! I haven't seen the movie, but will now! I was a kid when this came out and have heard of it, but never knew what it was about. Glad I read this 'scary classic'."
4,If you've read the book no need to see the movie,"The book came out first. It is page turner. I enjoyed it very much.There is almost no difference between the book and the movie. Even throw away dialogue is exactly the same. The only difference is that the character of Hutch is a bit more fleshed out in the book. Other than that, everything is exactly the same. Apparently Roman Palanski had Ira Levin on the movie set and consulted with Levin about the most minor character details. For example, Roman asked Ira about the woman that was originally supposed to have the baby, right down to wardrobe choices. That woman even looked like Anna Maria Albergetti."
4,Good read.,"Although I didn't find this book particularly frightening, I enjoyed the story and think it's well above average for the genre. It was well-written and the characters are all very memorable, especially Hutch and the doctor. I thoroughly enjoyed being in Rosemary's world throughout the read. So much so that I rented the DVD & I'm very much looking forward to viewing it tonight."
2,Disappointing.,"I found this book to be a letdown. The plot was slow and painful. The story seemed too simplistic to be truly frightening or even slightly creepy. And the ending was extremely simple and anti-climactic. While one would expect Rosemary to have a terrible reaction to her baby, she instead calmly accepts the kid. Not very scary. I just wasn't impressed with this book."
5,It's Been Awhile,"I haven't read this book since it was released back in the 1960s. It came across the radar during Halloween week, and I couldn't resist giving it another try.I rarely re-read books and expected the language to feel hackneyed or for the lack of technology to throw the story out of rhythm, but that didn't happen. A much younger reader than I might ask, ""What's a phone booth?"" But the story is so much about the people and events, and moves at such a fast clip that most probably wouldn't notice or care. The reader just wants to know what happens. And what happens is still really scary, even if you read the book a long time ago and have seen the movie several times. It's still really scary. Nice addition to the Kindle library, I might read it next Halloween, too."
4,Spooky but Dated,"This is an enjoyable light read, with some nice scary parts. Good foreshadowing and you can really see Guy make his transition. Levin has a nice way of painting his characters - they are not flat nor do they ever do anything out-of-character. Overall it does read a bit like a screenplay - no deeper than a movie, really. If you've been losing yourself in King novels this might seem a bit old-fashioned and shallow to you."
3,Nice Paranoia Story,"Nice little story, interesting mainly for its use of the 'everyone's out to get me' syndrome. Other than that, the shock value at the end of the story somewhat diverts the readers attention from the overall excellence of the book and subtlety of tone which pervades the novel."
1,Boring... yawn,"This book did nothing for me. Scary ummm no. Thrilling ummm no. Predictable ummmm yes! very boring. I love scary, crazy, thrilling and weird. This book was lame."
1,One of the few cases where the movie is better.,"This book is very dissapointing. It is like reading the screen play to the movie. It seems the book was taken word for word and put on the screen.I read the book hopping to get more insight into the charcters, but I didn't get it. There is zero character development and very little suspense. This is a horror novel, I think the children's book Where the Wild Things are scared me more. Levin's writting is so flat it does not build any suspense.At least in the movie there is it some suspense."
5,Captivating Talent,"This CD is truly a reflection of pure talent. This artist encompasses all senses of emotion and artistry through his beautifully written lyrics and music. Jack McTamney surely knows how to captivate his audience. One aspect of this CD to be commended is the artist's ability to span various genres of music in just twelve tracks. It is refreshing to see that there is still talent out there of this calibur. This CD has become a part of my daily listening routine. I hope that soon enough Jack's talent will be recognized by all other listeners; ""Halfway to NowHere"" is a must-have in any music lover's collection. I look forward to seeing more of Jack Mc Tamney's music in the future!"
2,XMAS bust,"Bought this for the wife as a stocking stuffer. The metal trim fell off the first day. Photo transition is very slow and the battery life is poor. She bought an Ipod, and gave this to our daughter.I would not buy again."
4,Spectra - Photo Keychain,"Spectra - Digital Photo Frame KeychainGreat product!!!! Lots of fun to carry 50+ photos with you to show off family & friends, vacations, & etc. This is much more than just a photo gallery, Outlook, ToDo lists, & Contacts."
4,"His version of ""One Monkey..."" is better than Bette Midler's","I've been listening to Bobby Rush's music for a few years. This CD is an excellent example of the energy Bobby Rush puts forth in his music. Recently, Bette Midler came out with a new CD entitled ""Bathhouse Betty."" One of her selections is ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show."" Go with Bobby--you won't regret buying this CD."
5,Most affordable of the classics on hydrodynamic stability,"This is one of the standard monographs on hydrodynamic instabilities, considered a classic. It was published by Oxford UP in 1961 and is kept in print (at a bargain price) by Dover. It is still very usable, easy to read, and an excellent introduction, although on some points it is out of date. For Rayleigh-Benard convection, a reader would do well to consult more recent books like Drazin & Reid, Swinney & Gollub, Koschmieder, and Getling. However, nobody covers the linear theory better than Chandrasekhar."
5,Book on Hydrodynamic,This is one of the classic books written by Chandrasekhar. This isextremely helpful for the people working on Hydrodynamic andHydromagnetic Stability.
2,Even less correct now than in 1991.,"Attali's intriguing thesis--the microchip will allow for a reshuffling of the world geopolitical power structure and promote the growth and social dominance of ""nomadic men"" with few ties to place or fellow man--is consistently undermined, and eventually rendered ineffective, by three problems:A pervasive and thinly disguised national chauvinism;Grossly inaccurate macroeconomic forecasting; andA pendantic and condescending Foreward by Alvin Toffler which insists that we, as provincial and intellectually vacant Americans, must read this book simply because Attali is a stunning genius eager to save us from our own ignorance.I will give this book one more star for each of the problems the author chooses to correct in future editions."
2,Freudian or Frivolous,"Any reasonably sized trash dump is loaded with multi-layered complexity and interesting items for us to discover, but it still smells rather bad. Thomas presents a dying Freud, his mind awash with drugs and inconsistent memories flowing into a quasi-fictional Freud drawn from the admitted lies of his journals and finally a strangely clairvoyant Freud who sees snippets of the future and completely misinterprets the message each time -- a bumbling mortal that seems to only remember the naughty bits with any clarity. What was the point?"
4,Minutes to miles..,"I heard about these guys over on the popular website myspace.com. I waited patiently for this album to come out after hearing two songs off of the album, ""Get up, shut up"" and ""Dial M for murder"". I was not disappointed in this album for one second. People can stereotype these guys and this album as another mainstream pop-punk band, but as long as they create good music, I will give these guys a good review.Top 5 songs:1. Get up, shut up2. Serious3. Dial M for murder4. Actions not words5. Minutes to miles"
1,"Worked Great, then came the 48 hour mark","Ok. Under a lot of research, the Ipod subsitute came down to the iriver H10 or Sony HD5. The software was the deal breaker. I didn't want sonic stage on ym computer. So I got the H10. Went to best buy and got it. It was amazing. I was so happy. Then, the next day, it wouldn't connect to the computer. I reset it and it still didn't recognize that it was there. The battery meter never worked as well. So I was confused and decided to return it and give iRiver a second chance. I turned the H10 on after 2 days, and all i got was a white screen when it was connected to a computer. I reset it. Again, blank white screen. I was severely disappointed in this product because I've had high hopes for it. The FM transmitter works like a charm however. Iriver isn't totally bad, just that H10."
1,Would not recommend this player,"My iRiver H20 has been a very big disappointment. I've had to reformat the hard drive at least 4 times - about every 2 months which is a huge drag because you lose everything. I've sent it to iriver once for a new hard drive. It does not work well with Napster - crashes every time - yes EVERY TIME! And now my scroll bar scrolls down to zero and stays there so I can't use it. Mine is going in the trash rather than sending it in to pay for it to be fixed (out of warranty) when I know it won't fix all of the rest of the problems. If you check the iRiver customer support site user forum, you will see the long list of issues with the H10/H20. Invest in something better!"
3,Not Bad,"Not bad little player. Drawback is the navigation has alot to be desired. Slow scrolling through 40GB of songs. Overall: reliable, good sound quality, good battery life, sucky nav."
1,Nice but delicate,"This is the second time I order this device.It's a very nice, simple and usefull gadgetUnfortunatly, this one is not working at all.I'm about to make replaced."
1,Stupidest software design,"I own this item. I purchased it after having an iPod mini that died on me and this was cheaper per gig than another iPod. I regret this decision.The good thing about this is that you can drag and drop from Windows onto the Iriver. Slightly more convinient than updating via iTunes.The stupid thing about this product is the 'hold' button. I keep my player in my bag all day and use for my commute.When the player is on 'hold' you would expect that pressing the buttons would do nothing.However, when the iRiver is on 'hold' and you press a button, the screen lights up and tells you that it is on hold (probably for idiots who forget it is on hold).The point is.... when the screen lights up every few minutes because my bag gets bumped and some button pressed, it drains the battery like crazy. I can't even use it on my way home unless I charge it all day.I would reccomend spending the few extra bucks and buying an iPod."
4,It's a great value device,"The iRiver H10 has communication problems with my pc (i'm using window xp) . It didn't recognized the device . But after i read the reviews about this product i have made the device working properly . And you dont need alot of steps like some of the reviews said . Here is what you should do ;Connect your USB cable to a vertical usb on your motherboard . Then connect the usb cable to the device . Then reset the device using something small like a pin by the reset button (or hole ?) . Then press and hold the O button (also called your select button ), continue holding the O button and turn the power on . Now the device will say that the usb is connected .By now window media player will recognized the iRiver and Synchronization can take place . I hope this would help new buyers . Have fun all !"
1,UNhappy pappy,"I could not be less pleased with this piece of electronic dung. Terrible software. Takes forever to find songs. when you skip a song it takes sometimes up to 30 seconds for it to play the next song. Freezes up constantly on me. I have to completely reset it. When I try to log onto Napster to go, it tells me I have the wrong player, so I have to reboot my computer then it will work. Also it fades into songs instead of playing them right away, you can hear the song slowly fade in. I hate this thing!"
1,Don't bother,"I bought an iriver because I liked the integrated radio and the idea of not buying an ipod. I have regreted it ever since. It is constantly freezing up and twice I have had to completely reinstall the software, losing all the music on it."
4,As good as the Zen Micro with the bonus of the color screen,"I have a Zen Micro and I cant say enough good things about it. My girlfriend thought it was cute so I gave it to her. I was going to buy another one when I did some research. The H10 had some mixed reviews but after using it for a week now it looks like user error...i'll explain later. First if you have Rhapsody to Go (which I do) you cant complain about the price...its only $100 after the rebate...wow! Ok now back to the user error section. Many people complain that the songs are played in alphabetical order. Yes you can do it that way of you select an album and hit the play button on the side of the H10. If you use the o button instead of the play, you get the album to play as intended. Pretty simple but I can see how it would get a little confusing. So just for that I will lower my rating to four stars. Other than that its the perfect little player. As good as the Zen Micro with a color screen. Buy it!"
2,I River does NOT stand behind their products,"Sadly, I must echo the previous review. My 320 20 GB player, for which I paid 300 bucks, is failing to hold a charge after less than two years and only modest use. (I've been reasonably happy with it until the battery started to fail). I called IRiver today and was told that 1) they do not provide any battery replacement parts or service for out of warranty units, and that that 2) I could return it to them for about a $25 credit toward a new one. TWENTY FIVE BUCKS!!! As if I would ever buy another player from this company - HA~!"
2,BUY AN IPOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Even though I saw the not so good reviews for this product initially, I figured it couldnt be that bad, and went ahead and bought it. I mean 20GB for $150 was a bargain. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!! freezes on transfers, freezes on random songs, turns on and drains the battery when it wants, piece of junk................all i need to say is get a paperclip ready to hit that reset button a grip of times."
1,The other bad reviews pretty much nailed it.,"I don't have much to add to the long list of flaws which are described in the other 1-star reviews (the freezing and paper-clip, unpredictability, horrible proprietary cable, the awful interface, etc.). I am only posting this review because a company who makes and then sells a device this horrible should be held accountable. My little 1-star review is my contribution to that end."
2,the things I wish I knew when I thought it was a good deal,"1) that in just a couple years, the battery wouldn't hold a charge and die in 45 min. and you can't change the battery2) the paperclip (not supplied but don't leave home with out it)Every owner now knows about the papercplip to reset and has one hid someplace.I gave it a rating of 2 because it held all the music i wanted, the shuffle play worked well, and was a nice music selection away from home.I now wish I had went main stream and spent the couple extra dollars and bought the Ipod at the first.i won't send mine to the landfill just yet, but as soon as it quits working on 110, c'est la vie..."
4,Line In Recording,"Great player for subscription music via Rhapsody. Screen is brilliant. No complaints but one: no line in! If the player is described as a recorder, then it should have a line in. The 6G version offers an optional cradle which has a line in, but no such cradle for the 20G, and no mention of it on the iRiver site. :-("
1,Piece of Junk,"I gave it a rating of 1 because that was the lowest choice available. Amazon didn't give me the option of a negative number. I received my first (of 3) as a gift & it lasted about 1 month before it completely froze up & stopped working. Because one corner of the cover refused to stay down, I optimistically hoped that it had been dropped and damaged in the store or in shipment, so I replaced it with an identical model. 2nd one worked for 11 months before it stopped working. Since it was under warranty for 1 more month, I sent it back. Whether iRiver replaced it with a new one or repaired the old one, I don't have a clue. I just received a player back from them without any explaination about what was done. It worked for about 2 months, before it stopped working. No attempts at resetting or reformatting have worked. So now all I have basically is a $300 paperweight. I will never buy from iRiver again."
4,"very nice, a couple hiccups","I read some of the reviews here. All over the map. My experience is only a few days old. I like the unit because it is not all touch pad controlled. There are nice buttons for selections.I had one hiccup. The unit hung. The manual had no help. Apparently, hangs are endemic to HDD units. I am testing also a Philips 30 gig unit, where hangs are documented with a solution right in the owner's manual. So, it's not a perfect world, and these are, after all, nothing but little computers.I called tech support. I got good help in two minutes. I also got my own box at tech support. No one even asked for a serial number.Also, very nice, when I am at my desk I can power the unit from the AC and save the battery for the car or a walk. That is true also about the Philips."
2,MTP - iRiver's downfall,"I own the legendary iRiver hp140 and love it. I avoided the iPod because I didn't want to be locked into a specific client software.I bought the h10 20G as a xmas present recently and its Microsoft specific MTP (transfer protocol) has made it incompatible with 3 different windows XP sp2 computers I've tried it on. Beware!Unfortunately, iRiver has abandoned its UMS (Universal Storage) approach and open codec standards to the dark side (MS specific protocols). The problem is that even if a protocol is designed by Microsoft, to run on a Microsoft OS, it is still unreliable.I'm returning this - and thinking of getting the iAudio line of players. They seem to be the only ones left who build open format, UMS players."
1,Don't waste your money,It worked okay for about a month and then froze up one day when I was running. I popped out the battery so it would turn off and when I turned it back on it had deleted all of the songs.
4,"A bit buggy, but overall pretty good","Prosnice navagationgood displaypar audio qualityNo propritoary software (iriver specific that is)Cons----Documentation very poor, some features toatlly undocumentedno native compatibility with linuxno napster to go support out of the boxcrashed many times, database refresh fixed it"
1,Take your chances getting this to work with Windows,"I am really disappointed with the iRiver H10 20GB mp3 player. The player itself is outstanding - great features at a terrific price (20GB, color, radio, WPM,etc.) My son was really excited about getting this. HOWEVER, I spent countless hours trying to get Windows XP and WMP to recognize it. My research on the web indicated that many people are experiencing the same difficulties. It worked OK on Best Buy's computer, but, not a chance on my son's. Fortunately I was able to return it to Best Buy. My son and I are really disappointed because it is an excellent product, except for the Windows issue. FORGET IRIVER SUPPORT AND ESPECIALLY THEIR USELESS WEB SITE."
3,"I like the unit, but the battery time is lacking...","I really like IRiver as a brand, so I was pretty sure I was going to purchase one even before I started looking. I found this one and I bought it right away. The price was great for the amount of memory. I love everything about it except the battery time. I have to charge it every night! And then once it's fully charged, if I leave it for a day without using it, it will be dead when I go to try to use it. It's very frustrating and I am probably going to talk to the manufacturer about it. Maybe I got a defective battery or something. Other than that, it's pretty good."
2,"Decent player, HORRIBLE warranty/customer service","I got this player 2 months ago. It worked fine, it takes some time to get used to using it, but once I did, it was great. HOWEVER, I was using it while walking to class, and the screen just shattered. I did nothing out of the ordinary, it just shattered. The glass is all gone and the screen itself is half-black from it. I e-mailed them AND called them, and I was told from both places that the screen is not covered under warranty (seems as if almost nothing truly is). I even asked them if I could pay to have it repaired, and they said no, tough luck. Anyway, I'm pretty pissed off right now. I wasted 200 bucks on a decent player, but the warranty makes it not worth [...]. As much as I truly hate to say it, I may buy an ipod next... atleast they know how to keep a happy customer. I will never buy another iRiver product EVER again."
1,Dependability of near 0,"Like many of the reviewers, I was excited when I found an mp3 player that was competitive with iPod in terms of style and memory. I previously also owned a small iRiver player, with which I was very happy. So, I optimistically purchased this product. Unfortunately, I have had problems with it ever since (which has been for less than a year).Like many of the other reviewers, my H10 crashed more than once, froze up innumerable times, and now is completely dead. All of these problems occurred both before and after the firmware ""upgrade."" After investing a couple hundred dollars in the thing in addition to the hours I have spent trying to make it work, it is now useless. I was able to use it about 10 times -- total -- successfully. Don't even think about using it if you are moving...I hate to say it, but I am now seriously considering buying an iPod."
2,iRIVER sucks,"A news article even said that to work an iriver properly most of the time, you have to download music. You can't just rip cds to it like you can with the ipods. Definitely not recomend this item. Just go back to faithful apple for good mp3 players."
3,Dumbed up iRiver,"I purchased this unit because of my experience with the iRiver iHp 120. Though it's styling and features and color screen have come a long way, it no longer can be used the way it's predecesors can be used. It's been designed to sync w/ WM10 and you can no longer use it as a straight mass storage device. Though you candrag and drop you need to create folders on your PC and then drag tham into the H10. Therefore, I returned it and found that the iAudio x5 performs like the old iHp120 and as they say, sorry iRiver, i've had to move on as iRiver has had to due to DRM."
3,Absent customer service from Iriver,I bought this player for my son who needed to travel within 2 days. The setup with Rhapsody required several phone calls for tech assistance and they were very helpful. But after one day the MP3 player froze. A call to Iriver said that they would answer the call within 2-3 business days. We found the reset button ourselves and the player has been OK since. Its best to buy this product from a company that can render assistance much sooner.
1,DO NOT BUY IRIVER H10,"I was extremely delighted to but my Iriver for christmas because it wasnt an IPOD. I loved having napster music service with it. I actually didnt start using it till the end of january. When I started using it I found i was having minor issues with it and needed to start reset occasionally. Once I downloaded about 50 songs I found I needed to reset more often. Then finally in February the thing just completely gave out on me. The music system completely went ape. I tried to bring it back to BEST BUY for an exchange but funny thing is, they are no longer continuing the use of the IRIVER H10. Therefore I assumed I am not the only one having problems with it. And whats even funny is that amazon is having a clearance sale of all the IRIVER H10's. SO BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Don't trust IRiver,"We have an H340 that is 3 months out of warranty. When its non user replaceable internal battery stopped holding a charge we were told that we now had a ""paperweight."" Don't trust this brand as once your unit is out of warranty they won't do anything to fix problems even if you are willing to pay them (which we were)."
2,Buyer Beware,"I loved my first one so much I bought a second for my daughter. I understand items are sometimes defective, but I had to return this. IRivers support is awful. Their customer service skills are nonexistent. They advised me that I would ""just have to wait"" for my return, and told me they could give me no information on the status. This answer came 10 business days after their email stating it would ship in three. Should you ask to speak to a supervisor, none will be available. PLEASE check this company's information with the Better Business Bureau before you purchase. My problem was ultimately resolved, but IRiver would not even contact the better business bureau. I won't purchase from them again. I only purchase from vendors where I can get good customer service."
1,Highly Dissapointed,"6 months ago I bought the Iriver H320. This device was incredible. Drive letter access. You just drag and dropped files into the unit and played em. no software, no worrying that your playlists are configured or track tags are proper. sadly the unit was stolen a few weeks back.Having had great luck with its predesessor, I purchased the new HD10 20 GB player as the H320 is no longer available.IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!! no drive letter access really upsets me. The transfer rate is slow, the usp/combined power cable? why? the old unit allowed usb charging, so I could leave my power cable at work and use usb charging at home or on my laptop when out of town. No I have to carry around 2 cables (Designer should be fired)the up down slider bar, is very unresponsive and jumps, causing you to overshoot what you are looking for. why couldn't they just stay with the buttons?I think even giving this item one star after the H320 is being nice. Iriver you ""improved"" upon a great product and failed."
1,"Lousy player, lousy support","The issues I've had with this player are too numerous to list, but here are the highlights:-Extremely cumbersome, unfriendly and inflexible User Interface (UI)-Can create only a single Playlist from H10 UI-Updating firmware completely wipes out every single track on the player. That's right, you have to download every single song again.-Repeatedly hangs, requiring a hard reset-Repeatedly has problems synchronizing, both through Windows Media Player and through online subscription service (Rhapsody). Sometimes it's a problem with the USB connection (I have 3 other USB devices that experience no connection problems), sometimes it's a DRM issue (the PC or online service can't get the device ID), sometimes it's a mystery.-Probably the worst online support I've ever come across (and there's a lot of stiff competition out there). It's a cumbersome Q&A-based; Help, without very little A."
4,I was satisfied,"I like this iriver although I can't use it anymore lol. I got this in 2005. I know its a bit late for me to be writing this review, but I was able to store more than enough music on this mp3 player. I have actually been a big fan of iriver but they went down a lot. I have had three irivers and this was either my second or third I don't remember but it plays pretty good. I would still have it if my boyfriend didn't start borrowing it did something to it. I don't know what he did but it doesn't work anymore lol. Its small and cute and not very bulky. The only issue I have with this as I had with one of the other irivers is that it freezes a lot. Overall, besides that I was satisfied."
1,Poor performance from H20,"This thing hasn't worked right from the day I recieved it. After about 10 different e-mail attempts to iRiver to come up with a repair solution, they suggested flashing the firmware. It made the radio work better, but the MP3 player is junk. I am now pursuing getting my money back."
3,It really is just OK,"When I got the H10, it was great, it held all of my songs, and using napster to go with it was great. With so many songs on it, though, it started to act up. I thought that a simple database refresh would do the trick, but it didnt, it went on and on for over a day. When it finally seems like its all going to work, it wont work with napster to go anymore. file transfers are slow and sometimes unreliable. the best thing about it though, is the SRS WOW technology, which i will miss when upgrading to a different player. the H10 is just too problematic"
2,letdown,this isn't even a story.looks like it was slapped together in an afternoon.3rd rate. not a real Babar book.
2,Geographically confusing,"The warm family values of the Barbar series shine through, but this reader found the jumps from one famous place to another quite befuddling. It's fine, however, for those whose ignorance of world geography is total. Coming back to Celesteville at the end is a distinct relief for both Barbar's children and the reader."
3,Humorous view of old age,"Pessimistic, but humorous view of old age. The bluntness of it can make you laugh."
2,Very good,"Very good combination of newly arragement old songs and a couple new songs you can t heat anywhere else,truly a 5 star album"
1,Picky picky,"Seemed great for the money. When I opened order I saw one tweezer. I expected more sets due to the picture. I informed the seller to insure it was the correct picture. They said it was but would replace the pic after they got a new one. The tweezers are self closing and have a horizontal etching to enhance grip. To open the you apply pressure. I planned to use to micro solder electronics, but can't because the teeth @the end have a 2 mm gap. I think there supposed to be that way by looking @it, but it's hard to tell because one ""arm"" of the tweezers are bent - concaved. Possible to use with plastic model kits."
3,"Don't let the picture fool you, it's only 1 tweezer.","Do not let the deceptive photo fool you. THIS IS NOT a set of tweezers as pictured, but only 1 overpriced tweezer."
3,NOT WHAT IS PICTURED. ONE TOOL ONLY!,"I took a gamble and ordered this, and sure enough, you only get one tool, not the entire set that is pictured in the photo. This is a shame because I would have liked to have had the entire set, not so much worried about price, but instead only got one tool. In all fairness, the description does say ""tweezer"" and not ""tweezers"", but the photo is misleading and I will upload a photo of what you actually get as soon as I have the chance, but it appears to be the tweezer at the very top left corner of the set. That being said, the tweezer itself is well made and durable, has a fairly high degree of tension, and the tips fit together seamlessly when closed unlike many tweezers that touch only part of the way across the tip when closed. It worked perfectly for my intended purpose, which was the application of decals in a very tight area where my fingers would not fit."
1,Simply Disappointing,"They have not done it again, I am a salsa collector and know good music when i hear it. This cd is very poor in musical arrangments and singing with the exception of pete pagan. I bought this cd because i read a positive review on this item, but it seems like the reviewer does not know what hard core salsa is all about. Will not make that mistake again From a 1 to 10 i rate this cd a 1. Hermanos Moreno has done better i hope they get on the ball and put some real salsa out there."
4,THEY DID IT AGAIN,I BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST THAT THEY HAVE DONE IN A WHILE.I ALSO BELIEVE THE SINGERS(PETER PAGAN)&(JUNIOR TRAVIESO)SHOULD RECEIVE SOME TYPE OF CREDIT BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM NELSON MORENO WOULD BE NOTHING.SO LETS GIVE THE SINGERS 5 STARS.
4,"Nice, but not perfect","I'm a big Beenie Man fan and have been so for a while. Although he hasn't released any worthwhile tunes in years, I still reminisce on the old days when I used to hear a mix with tunes like ""Miss L.A.P"". Most of the tunes on dis cd are rare songs that were good but on 45's. This isn't really a greatest hits for new fans, for that I'd suggest ""From Kingston to King of the Dancehall"", but rather for Beenie fans who want some jams to cool out to on old time dancehall riddims like ""Mud Up"", ""Darker Shade Of Black"", ""Punanny, etc. I'd suggest this for any Beenie Man fan who has his official greatest hits already."
3,Too easy for a Level 3,"Thought this book would have contained a bit more than just 1-2 sentences per page for a Level 3 book. Nice pictures though, but too easy for a 2nd grader. As with most books with Level Ratings, I find it hard to distinguish what is true to that level? Some level 1 books for certain Series are way too difficult than others. I wish there was a standardized way to determine the true accuracy of reading levels in books. And I wish I could have previewed this on Amazon first. It would have saved me a couple dollars."
3,George Washigton Book Review,"George Washington was born on a snowy day, Febuary 11(22 on new calendar), 1732. From then on he was a devout christian and a great leader. His father taught him how to ride a horse, shoot a rifle, and hired a tutor to prepare him for his schooling in Appleby. Appleby was an elegant boarding school in England. When 11 year-old George was visiting his cousin's mansion on the Chotank River about 20 miles away from hsi home in Ferry Farm, a servant from his home burst onto the amnsion lawn and told him that his father was deathly ill. Shortly after he arrived his father died. This was only the childhood part on George but the book goes on about how he got interested in surveying, how he became a great military leader, and how he eventually became the U.S.'s first presedent. The book showed his great leadership and his commitment to the Lord and the teachings of the Bible. Overall it was a great book and made you experience George Washington and his beliefs."
3,Average Biography of a Great Man,"Starting with George Washington as a boy, this book follows him throughout his life. It focuses on his early military career fighting with the British against the French and Indians, working his plantation, and responding when his new country needed a general and first President.Unfortunately, this book aimed at kids could have been better. The narrative is uneven, making it hard to follow how much time has passed between stories we're reading. Furthermore, the style is choppy with too many simple sentences strung together. On the other hand, there are some thrilling stories from his days fighting in armies that will keep young readers interested. And his writing is used creatively to show his belief in God without interrupting the flow.George Washington was a great man we can all learn from. This biography gives some interesting information and a good overview of his life and times. Unfortunately, it's not quite polished enough to get a full recommendation."
3,Fine but Not Heavy Duty,"Thought these would be more substantial. They won't endure much usage, but okay for just storage. Don't think they would survive too much handling."
1,Must be Windows Expert,"This book is a poor choice if you want to learn to program in the Pocket PC environment. The back cover calls this a ""practical guide"" but the book spends most of the first six chapters describing how Windows CE programming evolved from Windows programming. You must be fluent in Windows application development in C++ for this book to be useful. The examples are poor and do not work with the Visual Tools software available at the Microsoft site."
3,moderately detailed book,"There are some useful information in this book, however, this book does not go into great details on each particular subject. The section on writing an activesync provider, as an example, is really scant. The book merely points out what code to change in a cookbook method without ever explaining why its doing it, or explaining the whole architecture clearly for that matter. IF you've ever read LINUX HOWTO materials, you'll know what I mean. It shows you what to do, but it doesn't explain to you why you're doing it.The most useful chapter is the last chapter (11 - Miscellaneous topics). As for the rest of the chapters, you can live by reading the online manuals."
3,This book is not for PocketPC,"Unfortunately a lot of examples in this book are not for PocketPC platform. I tested them on x86emu, Compaq iPAQ and Casio PocketPC devices and analized MFC code. Some examples must be strongly modified to work on this platform."
5,Great Pocket PC Resource,I recently bought your book and found it very helpful to all aspects of my CE development. Thanks for a good book and I hope you will continue to bring more CE information to the public.The chapter on creating Setup's is invaluable to me. Amazing how easy it is to create a setup program. I have been trying to figure this one out for a while....
1,Author can't decide on C or Visual Basic...,"Many of the examples in this book are in C, and many are in Visual Basic! If you only want to learn using one of these languages, this book is useless! The author needs to do two books (one for C and one for VB) or have every example in both languages. Extremely disappointing. Back to Amazon it goes!"
4,"Old Stuff, New Sound","For the many fans of MewithoutYou this may come as a suprise that four of the five members of each are indeed the same.This CD itself sounds nothing like mewithoutYou, but enough comparisions to them. If you were to find similarities in the sound it would prob be anywhere from Dashboard Confessional to Sullivan. Very punk and emo, with high ranging vocals.The music is very catchy and will have you singing along soon enough."
2,Cutting Trees...,"I love mewithoutYou and Aaron Weiss like mad, which is why I bought this CD. However, if you are thinking of getting this CD because you think they might somewhat resemble the style (lyrically, vocally or musically) of mewithoutYou, think again. The lyrics are not bad, but they are very literal compared to Aaron's mwY work. Also, my biggest disappointment was that it wasn't Aaron singing. Now for those who appreciate a nice sounding voice, this one is at least smoother than Aaron's, but it still has a punky-type feel to it. Overall I was disappointed, but like I said, that's because hoping for an easrly version of mwY. If you want this CD for this band's own merits, then enjoy!"
2,Ms Malvey needs a history lesson,"I started this book with great expectations, since I like Ms Malvey's A Merry Chase. What a waste of time! I can accept the standard storyline of marriage of conveneince between a rich duke and poor desperate widowed duchess who has fallen on hard time, BUT what I cannot and will not stand is to have the basics wrong - (1) Form of Addressing: Never ever a Dowager Duchess could be addressed as a ""Lady"" and a Duke as a ""Lord"", they should always be Her and His Graces; (2) the English upper class would never married in a ""room"" in their own home regardless how urgent their need to tie the knot; (3) the 2001 mode of speech is extremely off putting. I suggests Ms Malvey should put in some hours on English history or give up writing English historical romance all together."
1,No history in a so-called historical romance,"This historical romance is supposedly set in England in the 1830s. Hmmmm, trying to find some authentic historical details in it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. In addition, the author has got titles of the English nobility embarrassingly wrong. The characters do not behave in a historically accurate way either. I can enjoy a good Christina Dodd, Julia Quinn, or Cathy Maxwell where history is of the wallpaper variety but at least the wallpaper is there! No wallpaper here...Plus no entertainment. Immature characters and little plot."
3,Not bad but first look at the Sun tutorial.,"First reading this book and then the JDMK 5.0 Tutorial from Sun I was struck by how much of it is copied from the tutorial. The tutorial seems very well written and complete, and I would recomend it before this book."
4,"Excellent Book, but not for beginners","Although the contents in the books are a little haphazard and the samples don't run out of the box, its has excellent content.This is definately not an intro to JMX if you're not ready to poke around.Interestingly the difficulty in running the samples and the poking around ultimately led me to get a much deeper understanding of the JMX concept.Its sort of like how you remember the directions well after you've been lost a few times and havinng to figure your way out of it.If you use open source software and are used to poking around to troubleshoot its an excellent book. Just don't except too much handholding.Thanks guys for introducing me to the fascinating world of loosely coupled systems based on JMX and dynamic proxies!!"
5,Great book. Makes JMX easy to understand. Great read.,"This book is great for anyone wanting to work with JMX. I've read the JMX spec. It was long, boring and hard to understand. This book really takes the mistery out of JMX. It lays out all the components in an easy to understand way. It's readable while still cutting to the chase of explaining and developing JMX management solutions. The examples are good and complete. A must have for any serious enterprise developer."
4,Resource Book for Christian Educators,"Everist subtitles her book ""A Comprehensive Guide to Christian Education"", and that it is. Everist discusses both the theological basis for religious education and places it within the contemporary context.Familar models of development (Eriksen, Piaget) are analyzed within a faith framework to create an age-appropriate religious education model for faith formation from infant to older adult.Everist addresses head-on the issues most churches face in religious education: lack of time, resources, and personnel; ""competition"" with the modern culture; living within a pluralistic world. Her book combines theory with practical advice, and in the end she holds out hope that not only is religious education necessary to a life of faith, it can be relevant and life affirming to both teachers and learners."
3,An interesting look at the AZTEC courts,"This DVD is suitable for senior school children - The acting takes place in a reasonably limited area, and the acting looks as if it was set for a stage.The story gives a 'palace' view of a usurper taking over a tribe, showing the differences in the 'gifts' offered to the Gods (i.e Flowers vs Human Sacrifices) with of course the schemes usede to entice the locals.It is more a story on the application of politics and dirty tricks than the history of the aztecs.It has suffered the ravages of time and research"
5,One of the Best Books Ever,"I have read many fantasy and sci-fiction books and the is probably one of the best, if not the best. You can feel and understand what the characters' feel. I loved this book!"
4,A 7th Grade Student,"Twins Mitch and Amy are totally different from each other.While Mitch does best in his multiplication tables, Amy does best in her reading. They fight almost constantly, about the littlest things, and they like to annoy each other, like when Mitch had to read aloud to their mom, Amy sat in the same room, and kept on bugging him by gloating on which page she was on, and when their parents forgot about making Amy do her multiplication tables, Mitch reminded them. They never had anything in common, until Alan Hibbler, the neighborhood bully, bothered both Mitch and Amy. The twins set aside thier differences and then they went against Alan.I think this is a good book, but then since I don't have any siblings, I couldn't really feel the pain that they go through at times, arguing and fighting. But then Mitch and Amy kind of helps. It also tells about standing up to bullies, such as Alan Hibbler."
4,Fantsy lovers [only!!!],This book can be loved not only by fantsy readers but by everyone! This has to be Ibbostons best!
2,food,I thought island of the aunts was so so. I liked when they were kidnaping the children and the beggening was kind of bad.
5,I couldn't get my eyes of this book!,This book is so interesting. Great detail and a wonderful sesnse of humor. I love that this book includes magical creatures in it. Children and adults should read this book and I am telling you they will love it. Im proud to say this book will make a great book report book and a book just to enjoy. I can't wait to read Eva Ibbotson's other book The Secret of Platform 13. tHis book is fun and awesome I think any child would like to read as I did. I am in sixth grade and I know that everyone will love this book!
5,My students loved this book,I am a teacher at a private Christian school and it is difficult to find interesting and suitable material to read to my students. I read Island of the Aunts first one summer and then read it to my 5th graders and the next year I read it to my 3rd graders and they all loved it! This year I am looping with the same students and they wanted me to read the book to them again. I am just now starting The Secret of Platform 13 and I hope it is just as well written and funny as Island.
2,Criminals who save endangered species are still criminals,"There is lots of good stuff in this book. However, it glorifies unacceptable behavior. One of the 3 kidnapped children, Fabio, probably did need to be extracted from an abusive situation. But the book makes it seem ok that Minette is kidnapped. Her parents may be flaky, but still they must have been horrified when she went missing.The worst part of the book is when Fabio beats up Lambert because Lambert refuses to do slave labor. I can understand why Fabio did that. But it was not ok for Ibbotson to imply that he did the right thing.The book is really about the Stockholm syndrome, in which hostages become loyal to their captors and start to agree with the captor's crazy ideas. Not a funny topic."
1,Not appropriate for recommended age,"This book has multiple inappropriate words in it and discusses a nudist colony. I feel that it is totally unappropriate for the age it is recommended for. It is indeed a good story but I do not want my fourth grader reading it.If the author thinks this is good children's reading, I beg to differ and say, leave out the damn, hell, and nudist colony, as well as references to murder, killing, and drinking, and then she might be right.I am very offended at this offering and have found multiple other parents who feel the same. I will no longer purchase books by age rating."
1,What a shame! This doesn't even deserve 1 star,"How absolutely dreadful that a book with talk of drinking, nudity, smoking, and killing could make it into an elementary school library. I am currently working with our school librarian, principal and district to have this book removed from all of Arizona's school libraries.After an 8 year old reads this, can you imagine why they may think that ""killing the headmaster"" (actual statement from the book!!!)would be an appropriate act?! Heaven forbid this same child goes into the library to find any books on Christianity!!!!"
5,"Hungry For Magic, But Tired Of Harry- The Perfect Remedy","This was not one of the first books I read by Eva Ibbotson. She spins tales of magic and fictional but likable characters, the everlasting tug of war between good and evil. If you've been reading Harry Potter, and now, tired of Harry with no mistakes and no books since 2000, you have met your book.""Island Of The Aunts"" is a story about aunts who live on a magical island with all the wonderful creautures that live in your dreams, and more. Aunts who live there to take care of the animals are getting on in the years and need help. This is when they ""kidnap"" two wonderful children who have horrible families and take in a mistake. The children, the island, and the aunts all are going on a journey that readers will never forget.AND FOR ALL OF YOU WHO DON'T WANT TO READ LONG REVIEWS: PUT DOWN HARRY POTTER AND PICK UP EVA IBBOTSON!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good Book,"The book is about three aunts.Their names are Myrtle,Coral,and Etta.They kidnap three children:Minette, Fabio, And Lambert.I liked it."
3,I'm half and half (: !!,I'm half and half because I like the humor in this book and there's absoulutly not that much ACTION!!
4,Entertaining,"I am 14 and am almost finished reading Island of the Aunts. While this is definitley not my favourite book, it is enjoyable to read. The story revolves around three aunts who kidnap two children, Minette and Fabio, to help with work on a magical island. The end of the book is more exciting than the beginning. ubt overall I recommend this book for girls and boys ages 9 - 13."
2,Not so good,This is not as good as I thought. I still can't get the local channels as good as I did with my old RABBIT EARS. So much for digital!!!
4,"razor sharp, close to excellent","I've used several woodline bits and these are of good quality just as the others were. Unfortunately, the case is built cheaply(had to tighten the screws and adjust the hinges). There was also some rusting of the shanks on a few bits. Probably due to lack of complete oiling. The rust comes off with some steel wool but it shouldn't ever be an issue. All in all, the bits are razor sharp and retain a good edge over their lifetime. I'd give them 5 stars if the case were sturdier and if I didn't need to break out the steel wool. You won't find any bits of this quality any cheaper so I guess I'm pretty happy with my purchase. I keep coming back to this manufacturer so they must be doing most things right. Not Freud or Whiteside but close."
4,A comprehensive set,"This set has all the key bits I was looking for, and the construction seems fine. I haven't used them long enough to know how quickly the cutting edges dull, but so far I've been pleased. The dovetail bits, rabbeting bits, dado bits, and flush trim bits are all meeting my needs quite nicely.The price on Amazon was only $4 more than the ""trade show special"" price at the Wood Show locally, so it turned out to be a good buy here.The only immediate drawback is that the back/bottom of the wooden case is already falling out, though, with only very light use. If that turns out to be the only thing wrong, I think I've gotten a very good deal -- I'd rather have the quality/money put into the bits anyway."
5,ROUTER BITS,"Very nice kit... very halpful with basic jobs, i'm glad it was made in USA, not in china, if you are wood worker, you'll understend me."
4,Sharp bits,The bits are great. Better quality than I expected for the price. However the case is pretty cheap. Mine broke just opening it. However you buy it for the bits not for the case. And in this case the bits are sharp and well balanced. Highly recommended just don't plan on a case.
3,router bits,Wooden case was damaged when received. Wood splintering on one edge of case and both latches were loose. Bits were in good condition but looked like they may have been wet at one time as rust was on padding underneath the bits. Would not order from again.
1,Not priced correctly,"The router set is great but since my purchase in November 2009, the price has dropped from $171 to $149 and Amazon does NOT guarantee the price. For this reason, I do not rate this item high. Buy elsewhere so that you can receive a price guarantee/"
1,Help me understand why a hardcover book is selling for $149.00! Is it covered in gold?,Please help me understand why Amazon is selling a hardcover book for $149.00? Is it covered in gold?I can go to my local bookstore and buy it for under $35.00. I can only assume that YOU DO NOT want people to purchcase this book? Who can afford it? You should just NOT OFFER this book on amazon rather than charge such an outrageous price!
4,Very Helpful Even If you Don't Have Cancer,"This book is easy to read, interesting and moving. It motivated me to write about my own life in a more meaningful way."
1,READ THIS!!!!!!!,this relly sucks its just a big orange garbage bag. whwn i set it up (which took an hour to get right) i had to put logs on the inside so the wind didnt blow it over you might as well eat your money because that will help you survive longer than this piece of junk will. minuets after is set it up it ripped on the bottom. i threw it out as soon as i got home DONT BUY!! BAAAAD!!
2,Check your boxes,"I have been purchasing there products for 2-3 years now. Not always, but sometimes the box contains bugs inside the bones, that make my dog sick. After further examination it seems the bugs come inside hte box. Today I opened a new one only to find it full of bugs to, I threw them all away and probably wont purchase again. I dont urge you to stop buying the product but rather check it thoroughly before giving it to your dog. If it does contain bugs contact the company and tell them where you bought it."
1,"Good product, bad vendor",Last shipment was full of bugs. Not getting any more. Maybe I was just unlucky but there was no excuse for this.
5,Can anyone help me find these Milk Bone Biscuits,"I am desperatey trying to find Milk Bone Chicken&Rice Biscuits for All Size Dogs. There is a picture of a Cocker on the box and the biscuits are shaped like a chicken drumstick--they are hard rather than soft. For years I have been able to find this product at my local Target or Kroger stores, but not now. My little Sophie is almost 15 and just loves these treats. If you can help, please let me know."
2,My dog says bleh,"I've never found a dog biscuit my little Maltese likes so I knew I was taking a chance. Still, I'm VERY disappointed that there are no returns for the 11 unopened boxes. I wouldn't try them if you have a finicky dog or a small eater. They are bland. There's no tasty smell, I mean nothing. The cardboard box smells as appetizing. I realize my dog is hard to please so I won't blame it all on MilkBone. He's not a big eater and has never been a chewer (never chewed on furniture, shoes etc) so although he won't grab ANY bone, he does enjoy them. Most beef bones are too large but he crunches lamb or pork rib bones up completely. There must be SOME kind of biscuit to keep a small eater's teeth healthy."
5,"Buy it right now, no hesitations","This band is so awesome. My first and only concert(yet hopefully more to come) from C&S; was at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, SC. They were playing with Saves the Day, and some other [thing] like Ash or something. I would have seriously payed thirty dollars to have seen that concert. Their stage presence hyped you up so much( Marc Goodman and his afro jumping around), I wanted to start yelling the lyrics. I walked away from that concert not with Saves The Day playing in my head, but Circle and Square. I've seriously listened to their c.d.(athough only containing 4 incredibly rocking songs) seriously around 30 times. They have a great sound, and I believe in them coming with more amazing hits.No matter how much it is on Amazon, buy it, you'll love every minute of it. This goes out to Marc. Thanks for th e-mails."
1,missing items?,"The ad said: ""15-peice Impressions Cobalt Blue Bakeware Set"". I paid: $36.88. for: one pie plate, one casserole dish w/lid, and two custard dishes. And, a set of measuring spoons. Why is it the ad states ""15 pieces"", yet I received 6 pieces?. What a rip-off."
2,Choose another copy,"I guess I'm partly disappointed with this book because I remembered this story differently....Apparently Pinocchio was not the story of a puppet who longed to be a boy and whose nose grew when he told a lie. Rather, according to this version, he is a puppet who longs to be a boy and turns into a donkey and is swallowed by a whale. The story is wordy and yet you feel like you are reading an abridged version and the illustrations are cheesy. I ordered this specific book because I thought of ""Golden Books"" as classics. Order another version."
2,Disappointed,Totally left out the part about Pinocchio's nose growing. Now my grandaughter wonders if I may have told a fib ....
1,Not the Pinocchio I remember...,"I bought this book for my 3 year old son, thinking it would be a good bedtime story for him. I'm VERY happy that before I read it to him, I quickly flipped through it just to preview what he'll see. I was shocked to see how many scary images (for a toddler) there were. But the worst of all was the actual story lines...talking about being kidnapped, never going to see your father again, being eaten by a whale and doomed to die of starvation. REALLY??? For a toddler???Now I'm sure this was the original story and that's just fine, but if you're buying this for your little one with the idea of reading a light-hearted story about a boy whose nose will grow when he tells a lie (this was not mentioned at all in this story), then you'd better stay away from this book."
3,Pinocchio,This is a classic story but I have seen other versions that have had better pictures. Still a great book.
1,No Long Nose!,I had great service but was hoping for the full story of the consequences of lying for my 6 year old grandson.....not a mention...:(
2,Disappointed,What happened to the part where Pinocchio's nose grows ? ( Not even mentioned in this version. ) Might leave my grandaughter wondering if I may have told a fib .....
1,Not one word about lying or nose growing.,Do not buy this product if you want to teach your child about lying. There isn't one word about lying and Pinocchio's nose doesn't grow at all in this book. Very disappointed in Little Golden Book. I think I'll stick to buying my books from the book store so I can screen them first.
2,Not the story I was looking for,"Book was excellent quality! However, I bought the book to teach my kids the importance of telling the truth. This was not the story of Pinocchio telling untruth, causing his nose to grow. I was disappointed. The description of the book should have described this."
1,fans beware!,"if you are a fan of pearl jam, don't buy this! it's a badly put together, poorly researched, out-of-date, one-eyed beat up. get kim neely's book out of the library if you must. it's pretty much the same material, with that nasty rolling stone article from '96 thrown in for good measure. you get the idea."
3,patchy but interesting,"Sure, the book jumps around a bit, is patchy when it comes to technical details and is fairly poorly referenced, but there's some interesting and inspiring ideas here. However, if you're from a country with a lousy exchange rate with the US (such as poor old Australia) then wait for the paperback edition!"
5,"Highly readable intro to fate, time, change, agency","Chapters cover the beginning of time; relational & substantival theories of time; tenseless time; identity of the agent seemingly travelling through time; fatalism; God, foreknowledge, time & freedom; determinism & responsibility; and spacetime models. Very readable and insightful. The authors are leading-edge philosophers. Recommended for all readers."
4,Well-balanced 1987 live set,"Woods 1987 quintet preserved and expanded the bop tradition harmonically and compositionally, successfully embracing unlikely source material as the ""Star Trek"" theme as an uptempo blowout. Five lengthy workouts feature Woods' alto and occasional clarinet, along with trumpeter Tom Harrell, pianist Hal Galper, bassist Steve Gilmore and drummer Bill Goodwin. Galper solos outstandingly on his own composition, the Latin-based ""Tune of the Unknown Samba""."
2,Not what I expected,This book was just not what I expected from the cover. Very few cute boys and there pets and more freaks and geeks taking poor quality pictures.
5,My vote for best album of 2001,To just get it out there first Aesop is amazing. The lyrics on the album are beautiful. He has so much to talk about like his views on life. Just sit down and listen to his dope lyrics and perfect beats. This album is tight right up there with my all time favorite record of all time 3rd Eye Vision. Get this and listen
5,Great Album for this mountain chica,This is great music.I throw this cd on while doing everything from having tea with my girlfriends to blasting over the (...) blaring (insert overplayed one hit wonder here) next door. And the riddles in the lyrics are great. It makes for a great listen over and over for sure.(...)
5,W3rd.,"I love this cd, it plays at my job atleast 3 or 4 times a week, I could listen to it more at home too and often do. Anyone into hip hop should own this cd."
5,ATTENTION,"Damn. This album is a masterwork. Of all my musical recordings that I own, I have never heard anything quite like this. Anyone who craves phat beats and has any appreciation for the English language should own this album. Ace Rock is a genius. This album moved my soul to a new level of musical appreciation. I am trying not to be too vague, but there are pretty much no words to use to describe it. So just buy it and listen closely!"
5,Best Yet From Ace Rock,"wow if this cat isn't one of the tops in the game right now. i can't think of many artists, let alone hip-hop rhymesayers that have had the kind of progression that aesop rock does, but this labor days album is the fruit of all his past hard work. this is tight. too tight. where else are you gonna find a sick beat with anti-employer-establishment lyrics as in the working-class-hero freakout ""9-5ers Anthem""? he even drops a long-needed story rap in ""No Regrets"", and i don't have the capacity in this review space to explain it to you, but it definitely works. in fact, every single cut on this chunk of plastic will definitely ruin your view on everything non-Def-Jux. if you have only two albums you can purchase this year, buy this and Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein. Alternate between the two dependent on mood, and I outright challenge you to get sick of either album."
3,i don't care what you say,"okay, i can sense the people flying with responses bitching me out, but sorry, i don't like this album. it's not crap, but it's pretty close. given he is a genius lyricists i'll give you that, there was just something about this album i wasn't feeling. it didn't give me the energy i wanted. to me, it felt like he had something to say, but he didn't get across to me anyways. many underground heads would like this, but honestly, and cheifly, i'm sick and tired of it. there comes a limit in this genre and i can't take too much of it. aesop rock is raw, rugged, and heavy, and maybe he's too heavy. his lyrics are dope, they are sick and tight. it's his flow that pisses me off. i see you smiling saying ""but that's what makes him good"" ok, fine, that may be the case, but it's not for me. sorry. i recommend you borrow this one before you buy it."
2,Lost Aesop verse found in Bible Code,"Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions"
2,The horse is dead,"He's not without charm or talent, and the music definitely has a unique feel. Unfortunately it feels more like a Merriam Webster plug than hip-hop. Lyrical talent is supplanted by mediocre indie pretension and dead-end allusions to classic children's literature.In lieu of rambling on about listener castes (e.g. 'pseud'?) I'd like to recommend Busdriver as a more substantial alternative to Aes Rock."
1,"wow, even more garbage.","skip this suburban crap and buy ""ready to die"", ""reasonable doubt"" and ""enter the 36 chambers instead. cause the beats and lyrics on this are sub par. listen to a real emcee like rakim or black thought."
4,good,"You can tell he didnt have much a budget, but who cares. Its the beginning stuff thats usually the best and you get to hear what got them noticed. I enjoyed this album thoroughly, the beats were strange and clever. I prefer it to Bazooka Tooth whole heartedly. If you want a mellow underground aesop cd to chill to, this is the album"
5,Better Than I Expected,"OK, I had not listened to an entire Aesop Rock album when I decided to listen to this, and was skeptical that with his unusual style Aesop Rock could make a whole album that was as good as ""Daylight."" I was mad wrong though. This CD is definitely now one of my favorites. The beats are calming and unlike any other rap I have heard. Aesop Rock did keep me into the CD with every song. Although I wish I could understand just what in the world this guy is talking about. A lot of it went right over my head. Get this CD if you know what Aesop Rock sounds like, because this is him at his finest."
4,Gabrielle's Ma,"I do love this company. And as any other neurotic new mother, I buy into the exceptional safety claims made by this company. I am not telling all new parents to purchase this stroller (because it is on the pricier end), but please do so if you want a lightwieght, easily-controlled alternative to the bigger, bulkier travel systems made by some other better known brand names. I love the styling and color of this product. The only con was the inaccessability of the undercarraige storage area. If you transport a lot of items, you may want to rethink this stroller.Note: The diaper bag can hang easily over the handle bars of the stroller."
3,Very limited space in the under carriage storage compartmet,The under carriage storage compartmet is very uncomfortable. I have a HARD time trying to put my medium size baby bag in the basket every time; So I just don't use it. I have to either carry the bag or hang it on the strollers handle.
3,Finding the BEST stroller.,"When I received this stroller after purchasing it online, I was quite thrilled with it. Then I raced back to the store to compare it to the Venezia. Since I wanted to get the best stroller for my needs I decided to return the Pliko and get the Venezia. For $60 more you get a larger cargo basket, you can change the handle bar so the baby faces you, and it comes with a boot that zips on to use when it's cold out (which is great for us since we spend a lot of time in the mountains, we know our baby will be kept extra warm if it's cold out or snowing.) It's also easier to push a stroller that has a bar as opposed to handles. So for the money and the extra 2lbs it weighs it was so worth it for me to get the venezia."
1,THERE SHOULD BE 0 STAR OPTION,"I WENT SHOPPING TO BUY MYSELF A NEW STROLLER. FIGURED THAT THIS IS NICE SINCE ITS HAS A 5-POINT HARNESS. WRONG!!!!!I PLACED MY DAUGHTER IN THIS STROLLER AT THE STORE AND WITH JUST ONE LITTLE MOVEMENT THE 5 POINT HARNESS DETACHES ITSELF FROM THE STROLLER. ASKED THE ASSOCIATE AT THE STORE AND HE STATED THAT THAT THIS STROLLER BASICALLY COMES WITH A 3-POINT AND THATS NOT EVEN SAFE. THE HARNESS IS ATTCHED BY A PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT YOU SLIDE INTO A PIECE OF CLOTH. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?MY DAUGHTER ALMOST FELL OVER!I DONT WHAT THE ABOVE REVIEWS ARE TALKING ABOUT, BUT LET ME TELL U, I DONT RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER AT ALL!!!!!!!GOING TO REPORT TO THE CONSUMER BUREAU.THIS IS WHY I BOUGHT MYSELF THE MACLAREN TECHNO XT! AND IT IS GREAT!"
3,Predictable story,"I figured for free why not give this Barbara Freethy novel a try. If you want a predictable loves story this is one for you. Lisa and Nick are a madly in love young couple, who have an infant daughter who dies of SIDS. After that tragedy they divorce and do not see each other for 8 years. There is an intertwining love story, of Nick's sister Maggie, which I found to draw away from the overall story of Lisa and Nick. I wish the magic theme would have been developed further. I would have loved to hear more about Lisa's family supernatural history."
3,tons of proofreading errors,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I've never read anything by B. Freethy, so I was kind-of hesitant because I am so picky with the books I read. I almost put the book down and deleted it because of so many grammar errors in the book. I definitely think she needs to invest in a new editor or get another proofreader. There were several pages I had to re-read to understand because of the errors. I would give a higher rating had there not been so many errors."
4,I loved this book!,"I really enjoyed reading this one... I can't imagine the feelings these two were going thru. I am still thinking about it, even days after finishing it. It is definitely a keeper for me, and will read again someday. I liked it so well, I am reading another by this author, Ryan's Return. I guess the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me, was I felt the story was drug out a few times, and I was so anxious to get to the end, I didn't need it to be so descriptive or repetitive... all in all, I did really love reading this... I was very emotional at times as well... You won't be disappointed with this read..."
5,sweet home alabama with a twist,Great heartwarming story. Reminded me a lot of Sweet home Alabama. I enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down!!! for sure recommend it!
5,Excellent Read,When I started reading it I could not put it down. Very intriguing. I loved the why that the robin came to visit when Liz came back. Heartbreaking the way the emotions of each character are described.
4,Very Sweet Story,"This is a fun summer time read - sweet and pretty simple love story that revolves around a love broken apart by tragedy and another love that blooms upon a chance meeting. The writing is easy to follow and I really enjoyed the characters. Overall a fun beach read.I took away one star because the story between Lisa and Nick reminded me SO much of the plot of Sweet Home Alabama. After the first few chapters and after she went back home I kept feeling like I had read this story before, until I remembered the movie and it hit me! Other than that I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone looking for an easy and light hearted read. :-)"
4,Great story,"I really liked this writers style. A lot of the free kindle books are rushed with no character building, errors and too plain vanilla. This is a wonderful story with believable characters, I couldn't put it down. She does an awesome job of mingling the storylines and demonstrating the characters conflicted feelings. I enjoyed this read and highly recommend it."
1,Good thing this one was free!,"It is a very good thing that this book was free! The story skips back and forth and is not connected particularly well. The editing and typos are enough to drive any serious reader insane. It actually says she ""FLEAS"" when I believe the author meant to say she ""FLEES."" ""Tittle"" for ""Little"" etc. etc. etc. If this was created for the electronic market, it does not look professional. Please remember that spell check will not catch something if, in fact, it is an actual word!"
5,Good quick read,"This is the first book that I've read from this author and I thought it was a nice, quick read. I enjoyed the multiple story lines and thought it was a good book for a Friday night. I also enjoyed the different layers of the character's struggles, hopes, and dreams while still keeping it light enough for the genre. Some of the topics covered were a little heavy but done with grace and understanding. I'd certainly read another from this author."
5,Amazing free book,"For this to be a free book, I was truly amazed, it is very well written and easy to read. One of the best books I have read in a long time, and the best things is, it' free...."
3,One True Love,Not badly written but at the end of the day totally unrealistic without humour to cover the fact. Very ordinary love story
3,Good beach read,It was simple and predictable. OTher reviews are correct with grammar and proofing errors. Not one of my great reads this summer but OK.
3,"Didn't wow me, but entertaining enough","Everything felt a bit contrived to me - the characters, the dialogue, the two separate plots. It was entertaining, but the entire time I was reading the book, I felt like I was reading a book. It didn't take me outside of that awareness like a stronger book generally does. I'm usually pretty oblivious about typos (my brain will auto correct them), but even I noticed a bunch of errors. It didn't feel as polished as most traditionally published books.The, ""I want to, but I shouldn't, but I want to"" got tired, and the book felt long. I did read the whole thing and don't regret the time. It was ok."
3,"Great story, but too much information","Good story with great characters. You really get caught between the pages. Too much foreplay for my taste, it is more about fondling than feelings. This is not your ""Jane Austen romance""."
2,Painfully predictable,"""And they lived happily ever after.""It would not have surprised me to read these words on the last page after enduring 200+ pages of this ploddingly predictable read. Characters' moods turn on a dime, mothers-of-three suddenly decide to run away with strangers they've met in parking lots, and grandmothers spout precisely crafted words of wisdom exactly on cue. Children are cuddly after bath time. Bodies are lean and hard. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea.I'd call this a beach read, but if you try that, you're likely to fall asleep and get a bad sunburn."
2,Didn't really grab me.,I like a book that really reaches out to me in the first few pages. This did not do it for me. I am striking out! Hopefully the next book I choose will be better.
1,I know why this book was free,This story was ridiculous. So predictable and not at all interesting to read. There was a straight line between the beginning and the end and nothing to make it interesting along the way. It really was not worth the time to read this book. I have read other books by this author that were mindless but interesting. This one was not.
1,Beware,"I have not read this book, but I read Ryan's return by the same author. Barbara Freethy is not a Christian author. Ryan's return had numerous swear words and used the Lord's name in vain."
3,Divan editor even read this for typos?,Story line is a decent summer read. However the numerous word errors are annoying. Gotta love spell check but one really should check that the appropriate word was put in the sentence.
3,An anti-hero,The title character of this novel is cast as a well-intentioned individual who ultimately ends up as an anti-hero. Turgenev writes well but is too quick to defuse tensions or fails to develop them at all. It is a fairly fast read but in the end does not satisfy.
1,we used this hose 3 tmes and then it quit working.,we purchased this hose for our ogrill. It worked great for 3 times. On the fourth try it would n;t work at all. We switched propane tanks to be sure it wasn't that. We then hooked up a portable tank directly to the Ogrill and it worked perfectly.
5,Coupling,"This product makes it so I can use a big tank instead of buying lots of little propane tanks, thus saving money in the long run."
3,Not designed for the purpose advertised,"My rating is about using it for the advertised purpose not the quality. This hose is recommended as an accompanying item often ordered with the Del Rio Firepit. It does not fit the Del Rio Firepit! The quality appeared good, but it is/was totally unusable with the firepit. I have returned it."
1,This shouldn't happen!,"I purchased this hose in June of 2011. By May, 2012 it no longer worked! With the number of similar complaints about this product, Amazon should stop selling it! As an earlier reviewer suggested, I purchased The Buddy Connection, 12ft Propane Hose Assembly from Tractor Supply Co., for $24.99 and it works GREAT with my gas grill!"
1,This doesn't FIT the fire pit,This doesn't fit the fire pit I got. It says that this is the one to buy with it but it is NOT THE RIGHT SIZE...........
1,There's a Theme Here...,"Used three times last year. Brought it out this year and the hose is bad. Just like other reviews, it will not allow propane to flow. Stay away, this isn't cool for a lightly used product."
1,Short lifespan,Hose stopped working after a few times hooked up between a 10 lb propane tank and a Magma grill. Determined it was the grill end of the hose's safety release. Not possible to fix.
5,These blues feel so good!,"I saw this group live in Montgomery, and the CD does a pretty good job of revisting their wonderful live show. Nothing could really capture that live feel, but there are some great songs on this cd, particularly ""Evil Memory,"" ""I'll Always Love You,"" and ""Different Name."" If you like blues, you'll love this cd."
5,Every professional Gemologist needs this book!,"I purchased this book shortly after graduating from the Gemological Institute of America. As a professional Gemologist and apprasier, I can't afford to make mistakes. This book is a priceless reference. I highly reccomend it to all gemolgy students and professionals."
1,You think it works...then you get a yellow stain! Don't buy it.,"I too ""thought"" this was great stuff for my carpet - then two days after I used it I noticed all these yellow stains in the places I had used it. I tried numerous things to remove the new YELLOW Stain that Wine Out left behind, but it never budged! I thought it was my carpet, so I gave it to some friends to try and they had the same ""yellow"" carpet experience. Don't buy it unless you want a permanent yellow stain on your carpet! Smells awful too."
5,"Out, out wine spot",I used it for the first time yesterday and it works great. I'm glad I ordered two bottles the first time. Thanks for a wonderful product.
3,Focuses mainly on Bach's Church music,"This DVD is nice, it does give an overview of Bach's life but focuses mainly on the Church music he has written and totally skips talking about works like Toccatta and Fugata or the Partitas, for example. This DVD is OK if you never heard/seen/read anything about Bach's life but it is sort of lacking a bit in some details if you already know a good deal about Bach."
2,It Depends On What You're Looking For,"If you want to hear Bach's music, this is not the disc for you. However, if you want the story of Bach, with some musical adornments, you might like it. The entire recording is about 60 minutes long. Out of this, there are about ten identified snatches of Bach's music, but only for seconds each, except at the very end. So, there can't be more than five minutes of music, probably less, in the entire recording. If you're looking for Bach's music rather than his biography, you'd be infinitely better off by downloading ""The 99 Most Essential Bach Masterpieces"" from the Amazon MP3 section. It costs only $5.99. How can you go wrong?Or, ""Bach--100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces: Rise of the Masters"" for $3.99. (Sorry, but I just saw it)"
1,Awful experience,"Item looked decent, not a bad looking blazer, but not the best buy for what it normally sells at, but good if you can get it on sale. My complaint is not the product but the service, or lack thereof by the merchant. They do not get in touch with you about concerns in a timely fashion, took over a few weeks for them to get in touch with me after I first got in touch with them. When I returned the product for a refund, then emailed them about the status of my refund, they responded to my message as if they didn't even read what I wrote to them, just randomly writing useless information to me. Now they are claiming to have never received my return, which upsets me because it's been more than 3 weeks since I sent it back. I hope theese guys get their act straight because I am waiting for my refund and I am not happy about the run around I've been put on.Wish I could rate this a -1, because a 1 is too high."
5,Must Read,One of the most important books about our culture written in the last couple decades. It is deep content but easy to read.
1,Same Old Arguments,For thousands of years supernaturalists have been using the same arguments. The IDers have followed in their footsteps. This book puts forward the same illogical and unscientific claims in an attempt to support ID. The author fails by all standarsds to make a case. The bottom line is that there is no evidence for any of the assumptions or conclusions reached in this book. The truth has slowly made its way to the front and no fanatic whinning will stop it.
2,"Long-Winded Diatribe, Easily Going Off-Topic for PAGES.","This book takes complete determination to finish. Having a degree biology, psychology, and a masters in education, I find this book to go off topic on the basis of explaining science for no real reason other than to dismiss it or criticize it.We all know the story about Darwin's theory about Finches' beaks, no? SHE GOES ON FOR SIX ENTIRE PAGES ABOUT THEIR BEAKS AND WHAT THIS RESEARCH WAS ABOUT. Holy cow.I feel this book was needlessly fluffed up for the sake of looking and sounding more professional.I'm not sure I'll ever read anything from this author again."
3,Interesting ideas,Had interesting concepts shared about being a Christian. Don't agree with everything the writer says but it is an interesting read nevertheless
5,Insightful research on a present-day dilemma,"As a Christian, I have found myself at odds with the Christian culture without fully understanding why. Nancy Pearcey has done the research and answered a lot of my intuitive questions. Rather than expressing a judgmental opinion, she has sought the facts to build understanding which can lead to a wise response. This is a right-on book for today."
4,Interesting,I needed it for a college course. It definitely provokes a lot of thought. Very interesting . I still own it!
1,Evangelical Drivel,"If you don't believe the Bible is the literal word of God, you won't want to read this evangelical rant. The author is touted as a Christian 'intellectual,' but she's really a propagandist. She cherry-picks the scientific data that supports her dogma and ignores the mountain of evidence that doesn't. A very slick, although verbose, political polemic."
1,Pseudo Science,This book is a desperate attempt by the Religious Right to discredit evolution. The fundamentalists know very well that with evolution there is no fall of mankind (Since it evolved maneas not born perfect) and therefore no need for redemption. The whole theological underpinnings of Christianity crumble. This book is not even worth a skim and should be tossed.
1,Total Truth: Stating Fact after Fact after Fact after Fact,"Nancy Pearcey relies heavily on her sources, attempting to put forth the ideas of Chesterton, Lewis, Schaeffer, and others, but only doing so half as well. She had me interested until she resorted to 150 pages of mere facts without philosophy. She criticizes Augustine for asserting the obvious, that man is a dual creature, spiritual and physical, and is thus divided in his understanding when nothing could be more obvious! Instead of reading this book, read Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton and Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis.OrthodoxyMere Christianity (C.S. Lewis Signature Classics)"
1,not happy,"I bought this for a gift. Was I surprised to find it was a 31 page pamphlet, with the first 12 pgs nothing but intro and history of euchre. I'm now making a trip to the bookstore to find a book. Don't feel this is worth the money at all."
5,Love it!,"This is a wonderful introduction to the opera for children! It covers everything from the plots of the best-known operas to the jobs of the stage manager and general director. The history of the opera is also included. My two-year-old loves the opera (I know, weird, right), and this is her favorite book! I've learned quite a lot, too. I highly recommend this book to anyone (young our old) who is beginning to learn and love opera!"
5,The essence of the kind of Jazz I love.,What caused me to purchase this album was more the fact that I was a Far Side fan. The cover picture was done after Gary Larson retired. He did this because of the countless hours he spent listening to Herb Ellis while creating his panel.I first heard about this album on NPR. The pieces reminded me of the music I would hear on the Pittsburgh channel; WDUQ. (At the time it was a Sun-up to Sun-down only Jazz station before themselves being bought by NPR). That station was a delightfull alternative to the heavy rock & roll that I preferred back in the halcyon days of my youth.Now that I live in another place that has no such jazz station; I had begun a small Jazz collection. This is one of my favorites. The samples that Amazon.com really provide you with the feel of this kind of Jazz.
3,Review of this LP,"I believe the only song I ever heard from this LP is ""Time Is Running Out"". The LP ""Lost In Space"" contains the hit's ""Pack Jam"", ""Space Is the Place"", and ""Space Cowboy"". I hope this will answer your question.Signing out,DJ Larry B"
3,A long search for an old album,"I've been searching for the first album done by jonzun crew back in the early 80's called, ""We Are the Jonzun Crew"". It also contains the smash hit, ""space cowboys"" and "" space is the place"", with it's title hit song, "" we are the jonzun crew""."
1,Terrible,Do not buy this prooduct very flimsy!! doesnt hit well. It is a big string! So mad I wasted the money!
5,The Ultimate Stoner's Soundtrack,"I picked up this disk last fall and I have to say it's provided me hours of enjoyment. A really wide range of music is represented here by some of Boston's finest artists including Tim Kelly, Nineteen, Caged Heat, & MAO Inhibitor. Head Candy!"
2,"It's not fantastic, that's for sure.","I've had this humidifier for a couple of years but I haven't used it much. I use it mostly when I'm sick or when the air just feels really dry.I've been sick for a few days now and it's been running nonstop. The other review that talks about the room being damp and I must have a completely different machine. The machine doesn't mist AT ALL, but it must release some water into the air because every once in awhile I notice that the tank is empty. I certainly do not notice a huge difference in the amount of moisture in the air.I haven't had any problems with the tank cracking or anything, but I think I'd prefer a humidifier that I didn't have to sit within 1 foot of for it to do any good."
1,Don't buy this garbage,"I bought this product thinking that it would suffice for my needs and boy was I wrong. All I wanted was a humidifier that would automatically keep the humidity of the room at optimal level. I brought this thing home filled it up at set it to run on high @ 40% humidity. (a common amount), If theory it was suppose to shut off when it reached that level, but insted it ran ALL night (for about 9 hours) non-stop! It never shut off once and when I woke up in the morning, I will admit that the room was humid... Everything was damp. It must have been at least 70% humidity in there, and the tank was bone dry as well. Only buy this if you plan on just leaving it run all the time or you are putting it in a completly sealed off room. (no heating vents). The automatatic shut off and humidity sensors are absolute crap! I am returning this hunk of junk today!"
2,About time for this once great band to give it up.,"Not a bad album overall, but compared to their great works of the late '70s and even their good work of the '80s, this album falls far short. Some good songs, but most are ruined by Paul Roberts, who sounds too much like Bowie and not enough like a real human being. His ""euro"" vocalization makes me cringe in places. About Time for this band to give it up."
3,title not indicative,"Although I didn't see anything that disagreed with scripture, this book didn't compare with some I've read on heaven that gave a real ""taste of heaven"" - Try ""My Dream of Heaven"" by Rebecca Springer."
4,A good intro into the mind and culture of the Zuni.,I first read this book while taking an introductory anthropology course at Cleveland State. Jim Frank was my teacher and this course and this book in particular started me down the road in seeking knowledge in the area of the social sciences. This book is an excellent starter for someone who knows very little about the native cultures of our great land.
2,Expurgated,"Beware this is an expurgated version. It doesn't say so until the last page. Evidently the translator thought the homosexually-tinged ""racy"" bits were not worth reading (though he had no trouble including the heterosexual racy bits). I prefer to read everything in a book, and decide for myself."
1,avoid this edition!,"This is one of those strange off-prints one finds occasionally on Amazon, which shouldn't provide such unscrupulous profit seekers a venue. There is absolutely no publication information of any kind on this oddly sized volume--no date, no city or country, and most offensively, no identification of the translator. The text is very poorly typeset, with countless run-on words and oddly spaced lines due to faulty justification of the margins. Paragraphs are not indented. These cheaply printed editions advertise themselves as preserving the world's great literature, as if works such as this one were in danger of disappearing! Do yourself the favor of avoiding the irritation of reading such a poorly produced text--which is only making money for some unscrupulous business--and order one of the other legitimate editions available here and elsewhere. And add your voice to those that would like Amazon to stop selling such inferior products!"
2,"Fun For Literary Snobs, I Guess","The book starts off beautifully, with a wonderful turn of phrase and a delightfully absurd main character. Too bad it dissolves into chapter after chapter of discourse on the main characters literary likes and dislikes (which often smacks of the author's taste bleeding through to the story) as an example of his internal character. Yes, the books reflect the man, but do I have to sit through a hundred pages of literary opinion? It's excessive past excessive when the point could have been made in one chapter, and dull to boot (considering these are mainly old Latin and French works with which most modern people would be unfamiliar).It picks up a little at the end, when the main character's eccentric behavior finally does him in, and the doctor orders a return to normal life as the only cure. A return to more popular literature is the only cure for this book."
4,"Life, Love and Laughter","Love, Life and Laughter is such an inspirational book! Fr. Jim Vlaun's use of real life expirences help the reader to better understand the Consciousness Examen. He explains each step of the examen so that the reader can fully understand and experience the Examen. He shows each of us how to live the Consciousness Examen and let God into our lives.There are five steps to the Consciousness Examen:A Prayer for EnlightenmentReflective ThanksgivingSurvey of ActionsContrition and SorrowResloution for FutureIf you read the book and follow each step of the Examen as Fr. Jim explains it and use in your daily life, you can truly be fulfilled because you have let God into your life.When St Ignatius came up with the Consciousness Examen, I don't think he thought that over a century later, a man like Fr. Jim would be writing a book to explain it so that people in the modern age could still be living it out."
1,one of the worst books ive ever read,"i didnt have a choice but to read this book, I didnt enjoy it very much, it seemed repetative. I enjoy reading, but this book didnt impress me, it was just a grade"
4,"Life, Love and Laughter - review","Life, Love and Laughter is a great book to read. It is about the Consiousness Examen. Father Vlaun explains the Consciousness Examen very well. He explains all 5 steps: 1: Prayer for Enlightment 2: Reflevtive Thanksgiving 3: Survey of Actions 4: Contrition and Sorrow and 5: Resolution for the Future.Father Jim's stories will just amaze you. He has some funny and unbelievable stories, about his travels, family, and food. Overall this book is a great book. Anyone who is interested should defintly read this book. It will not bore you. When you start reading it, you will want to read more. Father Jim did a great job with it. This book is a definite one to read."
4,Useful book,"I am developing a small item and I want to patent it. This book ""PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS & TRADEMARKS FOR DUMMIES"" helped me to understand the ""complexity"" of obtaining a patent right or a copyright for even a small item. The book is very informational and helpful and I do recommend it to anybody.On a funny note, the complexity and the financial burden of obtaining a patent it almost make me to ""give up"" on my invention!!!"
4,Great Information for Business Beginners,"When you think of a product you may be under the impression that I need to patent my invention, but don't have to do anything else. Nothing can be further from the truth. Henri Charmasson spells out clearly in this well written, humorous book how one must wisely go out and protect their intellectual property. He cleverly steers you through the unfriendly and confusing halls of the USPTO - the Patent and Trademark office, and guides you to seeking out the advice of an IP professional, (namely a patent attorney). It is a must read for new business owners, and many established businesses can use the help as well. But after going through the book, you will learn one thing - ""Do not to go about patenting and Trademarking by yourself. Get a professional to help you."""
2,"Sales pitch for lawyers, by lawyers","Not very useful if you are looking for DIY patent info, but goes into great depth on why you MUST hire a lawyer or all is lost."
2,Go to Nolo,"Let me sum up this book for you - hire an attorney. There, I saved you $20. If you really want to tackle writing your own patent, check out Nolo's books. They're very good."
2,Slightly Usefull,"I bought this book to learn how to draft a patent. Some parts are not writen for a layman and don't do a good job of explaining. And several times he says, ""Don't try this yourself, you will need a patent agent.""So then why even have the book?"
4,Early Dalziel & Pascoe - Mostly Dalziel,"""An April Shroud"" is one of Felony & Mayhem Publishing's reprints of excellent (mostly) mysteries from the 70s and before. In this very well written Reginald Hill story, Dalziel and Pascoe have become the formidable detective team they will be for years to come, but Pascoe marries Ellie in the first chapter and leaves on a honeymoon, leaving Dalziel to take some time off on his own after the wedding. Big Andy is soon embroiled with a bizaare menage that generates dead bodies on a regular basis.As always, the best part of ""An April Shroud"" are the highly original characters and witty dialogue that are hallmarks of author Hill (and pretty much unequalled by any other mystery or other genre writer in 20 years). The book's plot is unusually serpentine and the denouement both funny and a bit opaque. In any event, it's a fine piece of writing that any reader will enjoy. Recommended."
2,"Yada, Yada",Any early Hill effort which develops so slowly it is better as a sleep aid than a thriller.
5,Nick Carbo!,"I would never have purchased this book, nor would I have even become familiar with the (frickin' awesome!!!) work of Carbos without my needing the book for a class... some classes really are worthwhile!! I recommend (highly) ANYTHING by Nick Carbos."
5,Good memory card,"This memory card works a little better than the other cards for the Playstation. I was able to save an entire season on NHL 99. That's including my custom rosters (Gretzky, Messier, Lindros, and Jagr on Washington?). I highly recommend this to any sports gamers."
3,Mars Lander for the new millenium,"Back in the good ol' days, Estes offered the legendary Mars Lander, which has since become hands-down the most clamored for reissue of the entire back catalog. When the Outlander was announced, many took it as a sign that the original Lander might soon follow. So far it hasn't, but that hasn't stopped quite a few fliers from painting the Outlander like their old Mars Lander. The only problem is that the Outlander is too heavy to fly with any confidence with the 18mm motor mount that is included with the kit. Best bet is to go with a 24mm mount, which will enable you to fly it on D engines. Still in all, a pretty cool offering from Estes. Now about that Mars Lander....."
1,Massively Underpowered,"This is a nice looking rocket, and fun to build, provided that you enjoy lots of assembly (like I do). It sure was great looking on the shelf. Notice I said ""WAS"".If you have any plans to launch it--you may want to reconsider. Even with a C engine, this rocket is WAY underpowered. My first launch went ok--but it arcs over badly in any kind of wind. My second just didn't have enough power--it ejected about 10 feet off the ground, and all my hard work shattered into a million pieces.Don't waste your time on this product unless you are willing to put the effort into upgrading it to D engines--which isn't exactly trivial since it's a larger diameter engine casing.I don't believe Estes markets this rocket anymore--and for good reason. They know it's a marginal product."
5,Well worth the money,"Used it on my chopping axe, worked great. I could not find it's equal for the money on the net."
3,Needs oil for use,"This is a nice little sharpener, but it does need oil when used. Which then makes it a little hard to grasp and can lead to one cutting oneself if not careful.The need to use oil with it, makes it a little impractical to carry in the field.The Lansky Puck can be used dry, so it is suitable for carry in the woods."
1,the long trip down for burt,"this is yet one more atempt by burt to lose the ""good 'ole boy"" image he spent the 70's building up. and once again he just can't get past this problem of finding good scripts. this mess was written by william goldman(magic,all the presidents men),but it just lays there and never takes off.the action is really poor when you know that burt is able to do better.he looks lost and tired in most scenes and a scene early in the movie is really close to home,burt plays a thug so some guy who payed him can look good to a woman by beating burt up,see burt will do anything for money! mmmmmmmm could life and art be one and the same in this turkey? skip it!!!!"
1,Criminal,"This man, Brandon Yanvari stole $780.00 USD in 2005. Brandon Yanvari sold a fake Gibson Les Paul Studio. Do not purchase from him or support this group until he resolves it. An investigation will soon follow. Please contact: colbasia@hotmail.com if he stole monetary goods for you as well, it will be reported to the Local authorities of Washington State."
5,Perfect,It was just what my friend always wanted. She thanked me many times since she got it. It came on time and no delay. Thank you for the great product.
5,"Fly Fusion Pen meets all the needs, just buy another","The fly fusion pen is a great product. It allows you to transfer hand written notes to text word documents. As far as this ink goes, it's just price gougeing. These sellers know that Leapfrog no longer makes this product, and are trying to get rich off of it. Just buy another pen and take the ink out of that (it's half the price & you'll have a back up pen!) -- DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!! They are stealing from you!"
1,Dont buy from them. Their customer service stinks.,"Buy from Husky or somewhere else. Their ""exact fit"" is far from the truth and the customer service has been horrible. I told them I was having issues and instead of offering help they just said ""you can return them"" which i finally did. Four weeks later I am still waiting for my refund after numerous email requests. This company has no integrity so buy from someone else. I even copied the CEO of the company on my email regarding the frustration and got no response from anyone."
2,"Great product. Buy elsewhere, though","I bought Weathertech Extreme Duty floormats for my 2011 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab. I had been researching this product for a long time, and I saved money for a couple of months to buy the front and rear floorliners.The shipping through Amazon was lightning fast, but I received the front floor liners for a Buick SUV, and the rear liners for a GMC SUV. I know that I filled out the info correctly when ordering. I was really disappointed. Amazon customer service was awesome. I shipped back the floorliners the next morning.I ended up buying the floormats from Autoanything.As for the floormats themselves, I love them. My carpet is protected, the grip on the bottom of your shoes is really good, and I have no complaints. This is a very high quality product."
3,okay fit,"these are molded and fit well in my pickup, but they are just too short. they don't extend far enough forward. my feet still get mud on the carpet. i took some really cheap thin floor mats and stuffed underneath and protected the rest of the carpet."
3,weather tech floor mats,I really like the floor mats. all my friends have them and i really like the purchase that i have made.
5,Does What is Needed,"I'm a college teacher and I am very happy with this. It frees me up to wander around the room. Another reviewer characterized this as ""unreliable."" I haven't had that experience, although the transmitter is somewhat directional. Point it at the receiver and all is well."
5,Great product,"We've been using these at work the past few years. For our purposes (presentations, class lectures, events) this is perfect. No need for the laser pointer that later models come with, this clicker works great. You plug it in and use it, no need to have software or update drivers or anything, it's literally a plug-n-play device. Super easy to use, and (so far!) very reliable!"
2,Works but lacks laserpoint,"The laser pointer worked easily enough but it lacks a laser pointer an essential component for presentation tools. As a result I will hardly be using it.Bought the model with the laser pointer, it works very well. By the way it's used with a Mac Air which does not have much clearance for the USB transmitter, thus the slim USB transmitter is appreciated."
3,No Laser Pointer,A great presenter but does not include a laser pointer. I recommend a different model with a built in laser pointer.
3,Furious action - little depth.,"This series seems to be more in the style of Hornblower than the Aubrey set. Its is well phrased but the characters and their relationships are very poorly defined. Plenty of exciting and well detailed naval action but occaisonal apparent inconsistencies or perhaps just confusing descriptions are annoying. This second book in the series will be my last to read. After O'Brian's skill with situations and people, this is thin stuff that a lot of action does not suffice to float."
2,"Adequate action, unbelievable dialog","This series has a promising premise -- naval fiction based on the viewpoint of a China trader turned privateer during the Revolutionary war. However, the promise never materializes, largely due to the truly appalling dialog. People in the mid-1700's might have written in that odd, stilted, formal vernacular, but I can't believe that it was ever spoken. Certainly no one ever stood on a quarterdeck and emitted any of the pompous speeches that Geoffrey Frost is guilty of, if only because the battle would be over by the time they finished. The net effect is that Frost comes across as a self-righteous unlikeable prig."
5,Tyler at Ashley River Elm.,I like the book A pinky is a baby mouse. The funniest name is Beach Werner. In the back of the book there are 100 baby animals names. If you do not now all the baby animals hear is a good book to read. Pam Munoz Ryan wrote A pinky is a baby mouse. The illustration are good because the good deep color.
5,...,"I really liked A Pinkey is a Baby Mouse. I found out so many names for animal babies like a baby seal is a beach weaner, and a baby swan is a cygnet. There are a lot of interesting names. I think young kids would really enjoy this book."
5,Christopher From Ashley River Creative Arts Elmentary,A Pinky Is A Baby Mouse is a good book. I rate this book five stars. You should read this book because it tells you interesting names of many baby animals. There are a couple of very humorous baby animal names in this book. If you want to learn and laugh at the same time you should read this book!
5,...,"I like the book A Pinky is a Baby Mouse. My favorite baby animal is a seal and it is called a beach wiener. I like all of her books. Some of my favorite books are Doug Counts Down, Where is Porkchop, and A Pinky is a Baby Mouse. Those are all my favorite books."
5,...,A Pinky is a Baby Mouse is the best book ever. The reason is because I liked the way Pam Munoz Ryan wrote it. It is interesting because it is in the form of a poem. This book is about baby animal names. A seal is a Beachweiner.
5,Morgan at Ashley River Craetive Arts El.,A Pinky Is A Baby Mouse is a creative book. I liked the beach weaner because they were slippery. I liked the colors of the animals. The book had a lot of texture.
5,Hannah at Ashley River Creative Arts El.,A Pinky is a Baby Mouse was very interesting because it had so many different animals. The weirdest name in there was a baby seal's a Beach weaner. I liked the picture of a platypus. It was so cute but he had no name. I also liked the Bat because it has a name that sounds like it would be a dog. It's called a pup.
5,Good,"The Hierarchy descripted by her is wrong, but the Knowledge is very good! A scientific field very good information about ET's realities."
2,Too out there!,"This book is difficult to read, and most of the concepts are too far out in some of the new age concepts. It just seems like nutty babble most of the time, and reads more like science fiction."
5,Perfect Eyeliner,This eyeliner stays put all day. I love this eyeliner and will continue to buy it!!!!!!! Best Long lasting eyeliner.
2,Green Scene is No Dream,The color is way too light to show up on my eye lids and I'm fair complected. The product itself is good since I did use the other color I ordered.
2,False advertising,"The description says that this does not need sharpening, it does. This is not the twist eyeliner, it is a pencil. I used to order one that was a twist up but they no longer offer it. So instead I ordered this one and it is not the same thing"
4,Humidity proof,"This liner is fantastic. It stays on throughout the day, despite terrible heat and humidity, and even a bit of sweating. The only thing I can't figure out is that the pencil claims to never need sharpening, yet I see no obvious way of getting more pencil once it's worn down, without sharpening. Is this a false claim, or am I missing something?"
3,Not good for hooded eyes,Was looking for a pencil eyeliner that would work with hooded eyelids. It eventually smudged and did not stay on. It would be ok for those who do not have hooded eyelids.
2,The plastic case is awful,"This kit represents overall good value in terms of the contents, since a single digital thermometer costs ... It could include a scissor.However when we first opened the hard plastic case, half of the contents fell out, since they are not secured inside it. Additionally the case is difficult to carry by the handle (there's no hole) and is not securely closed. Not to mention its bulkyness.We returned it and bought Nursery and Bath Care Set by Summer Infant Products. For additional [money] you get a few more extra items, all secured in elastic loops in a compact pouch."
2,SUCKS!,"I registered for this thinking it would be great. Everything I need. RIIIIGHHHTTT.. haha.. The only things in it I can use are the nail clippers (but I cannot use the magnification because it distorts everything and I cannot see my sons nails), the hair brush which is nice, the comb which is nice, and the nail files which I dont like anyways because the chalkboard scrapping sound lol. The thermometer [stinks]! It doesn't beep so you dont know wen its done. You have to watch for it to blink or something like that and it only blinks a few times so if u miss it ur gonna sit there for a LOOOONNG time but hey it takes a long time to work anyways. The medicine dropper is TOO hard to pull out and push in. And the tweezers are very flimsy"
2,I don't know,This product has many flaws. The thermometer doesn't beep. It's hard to open everything falls when it is open.The medicine dropper is awkward. Etc.
3,"OK product, but there are better items","It is nice to have one of everything in case you need it. I found the thermometer to be good for my 7 month old. You do have to hold it there for a while, but it gets the job done. I was not satisfied with the nail clippers with magnifier.The nail clippers were not sharp enough and it was a hassle to try to deal with the magnifier. For some reason we had better luck with the nail clippers that we received that were bought separately by themselves. They are made by the same company but work 100% better.I use the brush, thermometer and the emory board the most out of this kit."
2,"Averge Products, Poor Casing","This was given to me as a gift, and although I have used it, it would not be my first choice in infant care. The nail clippers are mediocre at best, I understand they shouldn't be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son's nails. The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip. I have never used the brush, comb or toothbrush (I have others) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering! The case is cumbersome and of poor design. Everytime I open it - everything falls out!"
4,dad of a toddler and a newborn,this product is workin darn good for me. ya so what a couple things fall out of place you people act like your kids toy box stays organized. there are only 12 pieces in there its not that hard to sort through and put them back in their respective slots. and the handle issue.........grab it by the bottom....ur an adult you dont need a lunch pale anymore.....and the person crying about it not staying securely latched get creative and shove a little tape behind the clip...it will stay extended and lock in place....good product........good price......what more can you ask for..
2,Pass on this one,"You may want to pass on this one. At first when I registered for this it seemed like such a neat idea to have everything you need in a compact case but when I opened it up, everything fell out of the case. Nothing would stay in it's place....and when you have a sick baby at 2am you don't want to be picking up items off of the floor in the dark. Not to mention that the thermometer takes forever to read. Its a great idea but needs some more modifications before I would buy it. I ended up taking it back and just buying the items I didn't have separately and keeping them in a plastic zipper bag."
3,"Does the job, but not convenient","This set certainly gets the job done, as it has all of the essential items. But the case is impossible to open if you are holding baby. Additionally, some of the contents slide loose every time you open it and must be put back in place in order to close the case. The magnification on the clippers and tweezers seem like a good idea, but because they are low quality, the just got in our way. I do like the soft brush and used it during hair washing in order to avoid cradle cap... worked like a charm! Overall the hassles outweigh the nice features and you can save money by going with a set with less bells and whistles."
2,Sounds good but not really,"The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest. It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company."
2,Needs improvement,"I did a lot of research when I registered. Apparently I didn't research this particular choice very well. The case looks nice and I thought it had things that I needed. First, the case doesn't stay shut, so all the items fall out. Second, the items are not of the quality I would expect. Third, I don't even need half the items included. I would recommend buying baby care items individually instead of in a kit."
2,Lots of cheaply made products does not make a bargain!,"Being a parent to be I registered for this thinking it had all of the major items I needed. The tweezers and nail clippers come with a useless magnifying glass that is wobbly and gives you a very distored view of your baby's fingernails. Speaking of clippers...the pin that holds it together kept popping out (the ones that come with Lil' Tummy's gas drops free have been the best). The medicine dispenser is hard to pull up and doesn't dispense all of the medication in it. The thermometer didn't even give an accurate reading (scary thought). I gave this two stars because the brush, comb, nail file, and toothbrush are just fine."
2,Be practical,"I have seen this product( and others similar to it) . As an RN,we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the ""cuteness"" of items that are geared only to be sold, not to be useful. Although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful,and some essential, it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately. In this way, you can check for quality and longevity. Put together your own kit."
1,Waste of Money,"The screen protector is an overpriced and useless piece of plastic. It is impossible to eliminate all the bubbles, so it must be removed to watch anything on the screen. There must be something better out there.That said, the player itself is fantastic. I watch movies and TV while in waiting rooms and on the airplane, and listen to music in the car via a cassette tape adapter."
1,Junk,"I've used many screen protectors before and this one is the worst. As another reviewer pointed out, it's impossible to get the bubbles out when you apply it to the screen. You can view the screen with the protector in place, but the image is degraded significantly. I also agree that it's overpriced. I'm looking for another solution."
1,ZEN PROTECTOR,"No stars if that was possible...The same as the other rater,,,The person who gave it a 5 was reviewing A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ITEM>>>>>A ZUNETHIS ITEM IS JUNK"

4,Not too Bad,"Overall, I feel this CD features some catchy tunes, I understand why it wouldn't appeal to the musical snobs out there, it does have something infectiosly catchy about it. I feel all of the songs are addictive esp. the cover of the Mama's and Papa's 'It's Getting Better'. True fond college memories!"
1,It's A Bad Joke,"Fans of the band claim that the Popinjays are purposefully annoying, that the whole thing is just a big joke. That may be true, but the joke is on those that buy the albums. Don't be fooled."
3,Practical for basic knowledge...,This book contains practical (be is very basic) information for locating religious resources on the internet. One plus regarding this book is that it covers more than just the 8 'great religions' and also covers alternative religious sites as well. Recommended for the internet search engine challenged.
3,OK but,"This author belives that the Soka Gakkai is pure evil, and as a Soka Gakkai member I was deeply offended. But its still a OK book."

1,Cheap Phone Beware,I purchased this phone. It malfunctions often. Many of the number keys do not work. The sound quality is bad. Batery life is very short. If you do buy this phone make sure you have a backup phone; becaues it malfunctions often. The answerning machine recording quality is very poor. Your callers may not leave a message because they can not understand your message. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this phone from Columbia Telecommunication Group.
2,poor sound for a good artist,"I'm just a guy who likes to listen to music, preferably hip hop or rap. I listened to this album a little bit and thought it sounds real great. I don't want to make Speech look awful. I just want to say: If you are searching for music to listen to without paying attention to the lyrics, buy something else because then, this tape is a waste of money. But maybe (maybe) the lyrics are good."
2,Too Hip to Care?,"I am a Speech fan. I really am. But after listening to Hoopla I came away feeling a sense of wanting. Not for the lyrics - Speech is as conscious and political as he has ever been - but for the music. In his efforts to enlighten the unenlightened, he forgets (ignores?) the medium through which he is delivering this message. The music accompanying the message is uninspirational barring a few sweet tracks such as ""Real Love"" and ""Our Image"". There is a sameness to all the tracks that was so refreshing on his first album ""Speech"". But for the 16 songs, give or take, on Hoopla, it is repetitive and unimaginative. The reason why ""3 years, 4 months and 2 days"" and ""Speech"" were so well received is because the substance was accompanied by a burst of muscial fresh air. Sadly, Hoopla doesn't.Then again, maybe I didn't get Hoopla. But I think I did."
3,keepin' it ol' skool,"Im the biggest Arrested Development fan ever. It was sad when AD broke up in 1994 and Speech said that AD would last for about 11 to 12 years. AD lastest for 3 years, with there first album 3 years, 5 months and 2 days in the life of... was one of the grestest albums ever made in music history. The live Unplugged album was there 2nd album in 1993 and Zingalamaduni the last album AD ever made. AD's grestest hits were Tennessee, People EVeryday (Metamorphosis Mix), Rovlution, Mr. Wendal, Natural, Ease My Mind, And United Front. The Album Hoopla, it has one song that comes close to all of AD's hits and that is The Hey Song. Other then The Hey Song the album Hoopla lacks great hits. It has alot of so-so songs on it like Clock in Sync With Mine, Slave of It All, and If Life Is A River. I Like how Speech Keeps it ol' skool in all of his songs and to me its a good cd to have if you are a AD fan."
5,Ear candy that you can not get enough of.,"This is one of the most positive CDs I have heard in a long time. Yeah, Yeah has a nice groove that gets in your head and you just can't get it out. Mountian of lonely reminds me of The Artist (Prince)but with a more positive message. Its about marriage and spending you live with that person. Our Image makes you want to move something. The beats and the lyrics are tight. The mixture of jazz, hip-hop, rap, and R&B makes this a great CD. There is a little something for everyone. I highly recommend this CD you will not be disappointed.(Things that make you go Hum)- Real musicans do not have to use dirty words and sex to have a hit CD. Ya feel me!"
3,very wordy,The story started slowly. The characters took several pages to become engrossing. The plot advanced slowly. The ending seemed contrived. It was one of the very few choices I regret making.
1,I hate to do this but....,"In all my years of reading and all the stories I have read, I've never given a one star. I just did not get into this book. After the first 200 pages, I just couldn't read any more. The writing was sophmoric, very easy reading, with no depth. There was no suspence to talk about and I found nothing endearing about the characters. I'm sorry to be so harsh on a book, because I know the authors work so hard on their stories, but there was nothing I liked about this story."
4,Good performance,"very good performance by Tony.He really is a prodigy kid.If u r a tony royster fan then u will like the dvd. But education wise its not worth it.plus the content of this dvd is verrrryy less.If u want a good education dvd for hand technique, then 'Secret weapons for the modern drummer by Jo jo mayer' is by far the best option."
2,Tony's DVD Pure Energy,"I was so excited when I received it, but after watching it I was so dissappointed, nothing much to learn from the DVD. I only enjoyed his solo."
3,Average,"While Tony's playing is incredible, I was disappointed with the DVD. Not nearly long enough. He did break down some of his playing techniques, but I felt like I was left hanging. I guess you do you what you have to do your for endorser. Anyways, Tony is still amazing, nonetheless."
5,I thought it was Billy Gilman...,"I was absolutely positive ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" was sung by Billy Gilman, but a friend tipped me off. This tune made it worth buying this album, even though it was hard to find and not cheap to buy."
5,Discovery album,"We got the album basically for the "" All I Want for Christmas"" song which we got to love by hearing it on the all Xmas tune programs during the season. However,we thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the album."
4,VINCE VANCE VERY GOOD,I got this item in great condition. Packing CD is really important.The Cd is Great!!! All the tunes are right in line with the Holiday!Mike
3,one of my fave radio christmas faves,This song SOOOOOOO bloody rocks over that horrible version done by Mariah Carey. Unfortunately Mariah gets way more air time on our local Christmas radio station.So I went and bought the whole album for this one singular song!
5,All I want for Christmas Is You,I have had 3 copies of this cd if that tells you anything. Its the first cd I play at Christmas and my daughter and I sing to the top of our lungs. Its just a great memory maker for me. Not everybody's taste.
4,All I Want for Christmas Is You,I think the CD is great. It is wonderful to have it. I have looked in every store. Finally I thought well maybe I could find it on the internet and just order it. It is a wonderful CD to have at Christmas. Thanks Amazon.com for stocking it.
4,YAY!,"Well, for about 2 years, ever since I heard ""All I want for Christmas is you"" I've been looking for the singer. But NO! The freaky radio caster never said a thing. So one day (December 23, 2003) I found out that the singer was this women named Lisa. So I suddenly fell in love with the song. It's very beautiful."
2,All I Want for Christmas by Vince Vance CD,"All I Want for Christmas was the song I wanted and it's on there. It's kind of on the country side of Christmas music. Some of the songs on it were ""Christmas Time in Texas"", ""Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You"", I wanna be a Christmas Tree"" and ""Why Can't You Be Here for Christmas."" The quality of the cd was fine, but I just didn't care of the songs."
5,Love it,"I truly enjoyed this. I purchased for a friend and she was so exitied when I gave it too her, she played it immediately."
5,All I Want for Christmas Is You by Vince Vance & Valiants,"Thank you for having this CD, I heard this song on the radio, and it took them 2 years to give the name if the artist who recorded it. I have been looking for the last 2 years, and you have made me very happy Amazon.com is on the Internet. Have a Merry Christmas and wonderful New Year."
5,Best Christmas Album Ever,"Not being a lover of Christmas music in general, since most of it tends to be so dreary and/or dippy, this is my only Christmas album and I love it! I've had it for six or seven years years and have bought several copies for friends, who also love it. The title cut alone is worth the price, and I don't understand why Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You doesn't get air play. What a great song! Ditto their delightful, toe-tapping renditions of White Christmas, Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland, and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Makes you want to get on the dance floor. I'd highly recommend this album to anybody who likes upbeat, happy Christmas music. Now that it's close to Thanksgiving, I've already pulled it out and played it for the first time this year (2001)."
3,audio cd,this cd was a xmas present and it was a nice gift. the songs are good and it could only be found online. The first song is the favorite of all the songs on this cd.
4,Christmas Pleaser,This Christmas album was purchased because of the title track heard on local radio. I was really pleased to hear the whole album because it was fresh and fun.
1,Do not Waste Your Money. Buy Construction Paper Instead.,What a dissapointment! The text is a boring compilation of well known facts. There is no instructional leflet on creating collages as has been claimed in the book description. The art set includes only 6 sheets of construction paper. Get Ernest Ruboff or Mike Venezia books to introduce children to the greatest artists. Boutan's book has no originality to it and should have not ever been published. I have ordered most of the books in Boutan's series of 'activity' books and will be returning all of them. Get a set of construction paper at a dollar store and do not waste your money. There are better choices.
4,DANNY COMES THROUGH FIERCE as IF IT'S THE 420 FUNK MOB,"If there are any objections sustained on the standing up for the truth guidelines of Funk law and order, please be the first to fulfill the ignominy of such. Chief Sun Star Ali hears and feels the very essence of the far east coast connection, and somereel reel Mean Mugging. Prepare once again the sound system, forthe ""Deeper Prophecy is Clear!"" Flick the lights, for the 'Last Dance' is near.In it's day this album must not be overlooked!"
2,Damaged goods,"I bought this as a wedding gift. This bowl was dented all over when I got it. I received it in a box with some other purchases and some bagged air. It didn't have any packaging other than some tissue paper and a tag. If I hadn't waited until the last minute to order it, I would have returned it. Giving my friends a damaged gift was embarrassing."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"What a gimmick the advertisors did on this one. This is all my son wanted for Christmas. After opening it up and TRYING to play with it for a while, he gave up. It breaks apart with every move to transform it (even when my husband helped). And it is difficult to transform. Then, after all the effort...what does it do? Not much. Don't waste your money. Buy a laser tag set instead. He's spent hours playing with that gift!"
3,Good to Display,"Good to display, bad for the kiddies to try to play with. If your an adult collector that just wants to display MISB or loose go ahead. If your buying it for a child, buy something else as it will not hold up to a child."
3,COMPLEX FOR YOUNG KIDS,"SOME PIECES COME OFF EASILY, NOT EASY TO MANIPULATE. MY CHILD REALLY LOVES IT THOUGH, ONE OF HIS FAVORATE GIFTS ON HIS BIRTHDAY."
2,disappointed,This is an aesthetically pleasing toy.It is big and colorful and makes neat noises.but.....It is cumbersomeImpossible to transform in under and HOURNot much use to play with other than to transform it.Once transformed its parts wiggle so it doesn't stay transformed.It is made of plastic and VERY easily brokenthere are some small parts to choke onThis would be fine if all you want to do is use it as a decoration.
1,This Toy Is ...,"... It is very frustrating to try to get it to stand up and transforming it is impossible. Remember, don't buy this toy. Even if you love Beast Wars this toy isn't even close to worth buying. That's right people do not buy it. You would also give it all one stars if you did."
2,Transformer Cheeter/Cheetah,"This is a pretty cool looking toy at first. My son was thrilled with it to begin with but quickly became frustrated at the difficulty in ""transforming"" it and keeping the parts on. It falls apart very easily! It is currently still in pieces in his toy box."
2,Big Dissapointment,"First off let me say that Cheetor is one of my favorite TF charicters, but this one is too big!! First off in Robot mode he is nearly impossible to stand up without a back support, in beast mode he can stand on his own( but only with the feet in the right spots). The lights and sounds are the only saving feature. Yes He has two fireing missles(In one arm Making that side neadlessly heavy and un poseable) and an extending battle claw in the other arm(but you cannot use it when he is holding his sword). On a scale of 1-10 I give Supreme Cheetor a 4."
3,"Unwieldy, but fun.","My ratings of Supreme Cheetor don't really reflect how much I like him. I had to give him at most three playability stars, because he's just so big he's hard to play with. The only TFs he can face off with without hideous scale problems are my old G1 giants, Scorponok, Powermaster Optimus Prime, and Fortress Maximus (the only TF I can think of who's bigger than he is). In cheetah mode he's the size of a real house cat! Plus, his spindly back legs and the springy gimmicks in his forelegs make him hard to pose. But even with all that, I like him. He's not very playable, but he makes a dandy display piece, and quite a conversation starter in the office."
3,Don't try to pet this ---------------- KITTY!!!!!,"I'm so upset I didn't know Amazon was selling this kitty-kat for such a great price. Yep, I got my Supreme Cheetor somewhere else... for an unfair price...Supreme Cheetor is one helluva big feline. He's not your ordinary cat. What most attracted me about him was not his size but his beast mode electronic growl --- I LOVED IT!I shouldn't have bought this toy for one simple reason ----------I'm allergic to felines and you know what that means... I can't have cats but worst of all I can't marry a woman who loves cats! DARN! DARN! DARN!If you're gonna buy Cheetor then you must get it at Amazon 'cause you won't find a better price!"
2,Poor toy!,This toy looks all fun in the package but does not hold up well. All the parts fall off when being transformed and get lost TOO easily.
2,Cheetor - Electronic Supreme Cheetah,"Although the only Transformer bigger than this Cheetor is Fortress Maximus (from 1987), his size doesn't seem to help him in any way. He has little detail for a Supreme-sized toy. Plenty of gimmicks but, most of them get in the way. Overall, I think Tankor would have been a much better Supreme toy."
5,I AM TRANSFORMED!,"This toy is the best cheetor yet .He looks like a replicant of his C.G.I model. I should know , I have every BW and BM toy ever released and I have seen every episoide . anyway this toy is in a word PRIME! the majore fault is he to heavy and falls over too much. If you decied to buy this toy ,I would also recommend buying THRUST wich is another cool transformer.thanks for reading my review hope it helped you out. sincerly ROB T THRUST ..OVERDRIVE JETSTORM...AFTERBURN TANKOR ...PULVERIZE"
3,"Supreme Cheetor is finally here, but as a disappointment.","Cheetor's back and he's big. Real big. But bigger is not always better. There are many problems. Some big, some small. The one arm which fires the missle has an extremely limited amount of movement. And, although the feet are rubber, it doesn't always mean it will stand up. The sounds and light up features are excellent and give the figure a sense of life and the likeness between the figure and the show CGI model is very striking, but would you really shovel out $40.00 just because of his size? Judge for yourself on account of the sounds, the size, and the price. C+"
4,Too Easy To Transform,"The toy is okay and its durable. It looks a lot like the one on the show but its to easy to transform. They should have made another transformer ""supreme"" with sommeone else who is more difficult to transform. Overall, its easy to transform but it looks awsome."
2,Very disappointing,This toy is very disappointing. It just falls apart. You can't pick it up with a trail behind. Not worth even the discount
5,star product,This is a great book by a great author. Star Witness captures the deadly narcissism of Hollywood perfectly.Morley Winograd
1,As bad as they come...,"This is unquestionably the worst legal thriller I have yet to encounter. ""Star Witness"" is painfully boring, with a completely unrealistic storyline that ends with a terribly anti-climactic revelation of the killer's identity. This novel lacks suspense, drama, and every other characteristic necessary for a compelling read. It is nothing more than a windy, self-indulgent waste of paper that will leave even the most ardent of legal thriller fans struggling to finish. There is not a single character that you will care about or cheer for, and the Stanley Roth character is one of the most outrageously unbelievable cast members of any novel in recent memory. Save your time and money, and stay away from this listless attempt at suspenseful fiction."
3,Predictably Antonelli.,"I love D.W. Buffa's narrative, his style of foreshadowing events in the first chapter, his Joseph Antonelli character and his plot driven stories. Sadly, I found Star Witness to be too formulaic. Perhaps all the things I like about Buffa are getting worn, or, maybe the Hollywood who done it is the worn part. There was one section where Antonelli is interviewing a philosophy professor who is the victim's former spouse that the Buffa I love came through and I had to really pay attention to the dialog. The rest of the book is enjoyable if not great. Buck Schirner does a great job narrating the audio version."
1,worse kohler toilet out there,For a toilet that is more than $800 this thing should be a powerhouse. I order 4 of them from my plumbing supply (Kohler doesn't sell direct) and they were installed in my new house. I noticed that the flushing was extremely weak and had several plumbers look at them to see if they were installed incorrectly. I also called Kohler support for help.After a lot of review it seems they are working as designed- they just have an extremely weak flush.I called Kohler to try to get an authorized refund and they authorized me to get 4 replacement toilets (the same exact ones). I told them that was crazy and they should at least let me have other Kohler toilets and they said no.I am now in the process of writing Kohler upper management. From my perspective Kohler is awful and I will never buy their products again.Look at Toto toilets and other products. Kohler is overpriced and designed horribly. Looking nice means nothing if you can't flush things down.
1,Have never plunged a toilet as much as this one,"Purchased this toilet in 2005. After having to plunge this thing many times, I called Kohler and asked what was wrong. Since then, I've had to pull this toilet three times and this morning, I had to plunge it again and blew out the wax ring with water all over the floor. DO NOT purchase this model. The engineer that designed this should be fired - I will never buy Kohler again."
2,Wine rack,"After taking this item out of the box, it was damaged to start with. The work quality of this item was poor. Many joints were not solder correctly and there was a discoloration. It appears this item had been setting in a warehouse for a long period of time. Item was returned and a full refund came in about 2 weeks."
3,good value,"Good value for the $. Fits into our space well. Not sure about the ""copper"" description. Joints look like they are painted with gold paint. Arrived damaged but replaced promptly."
2,Is this regulator really 10 PSI??,I required a 10PSI regulator for my application so I purchased this regulator. I have found that I need to close the control valve on the regulator to allow my generator to run properly. The generator requires 10PSI of propane to operate properly and by having to close the control valve on the regulator either the valve is NOT outputting 10PSI or there is a problem with my brand new generator. At this time I am holding both in question hence the two stars for the regulator (generator got two stars as well). I will update this review once I find out which item is the culprit.1/16/2013 UPDATE.Well I've used the generator and regulator during a power outage and they both worked well. I did however still need to adjust the valve shut off slightly to achieve the 10PSI my generator required. I would recommend this regulator ONLY because the regulator has a shut off that can be used if the output pressure isn't as low as you might need it.
1,"Embarrassing, violent american junk","I saw this movie because of a friend. Unfortunately, it was just very boring and glaringly stupid. ""Since when did cops make things better?"". If you like chest-thumping action men in violent sellout films, enjoy. Otherwise give it a miss."
2,Just doesn't work...,"It is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action-comedy hybrid, however it just doesn't work. The action scenes seem tacked-on and the gags just don't work."
5,DA Bomb,"Dawg, let me tell you this. The movie was of tha hook. It was so tight seeing Steven Segal whip everyone's butt. The cars in the movie were so throwed and Ain't No Sunshine is the best song on the album. It bumps so hard to the subs in me drop top escalade. I will defenently buy the DVD when it comes out"
3,Stuff Blows Up Real Good - 3 and 1/2 Stars,"I saw this movie at the theatres and it was an entertaining, but forgettable piece of film fluff about a cop chopping up drug dealers and crooked cops in Detroit. Steven Segal stars as the strong silent type cop and rapper (*groan*) DMX (is'nt that also the name of a sneaker?) plays a role in this action fest as well. A word of caution: While watching this movie, do not use too much of your brain. The fight scenes and explosions are very good but no one in this film can act, but then again, they don't have to."
1,not that into it,I put this movie on so my husband and I can watch it together. I think it was boring. I kept finding something else to do. Which is weird because I usually like watching movies like this with my hubby.
2,A least favorite theatrical release of Seagal's,"I did not like exit wounds very much and storyline kind of bored me. The gun fights, car chases and strong language are ok to a certain point but they are too excessive here. Even though it did better at the box office then half past dead it could have been a DTV release in my opinion and thought some of Seagal's most recent DTV releases were much better. I guess though many people would disagree with me since it is played on the basic cable channels quite often.Peter J. Miller"
2,Suspension of Disbelief,"I felt that this is the first movie I have seenSteven Seagal in where he showed any talent atall for acting, which is why I gave it 2 stars.The mechanics of the police / protection sceneswere poorly written.First off, I have issues with the vice-presidentialscene. In a fire fight, the Secret Service aresworn to protect the VP or President. Somebodywalks up and tries to get the person being protectedaway from them will be given full body ventilationand a third eye.The Secret Service men here just nod andturn him over to an unidentified person.Not going to happen.Additionally, flash a badge to a SWAT team when theyare entering a building in a fire fight and theywill search you and cuff you to a fire hydrant keepyou out of their way until the building is secure."
1,this movie was HORRIBLE,dmx and steven segal ARE YOU KIDDING ME? that cast SUCKS. they dont have any CLUE as to how to act. i will tell you i started this movie and i very rarely stop a movie because it is bad. but i couldnt even CONSIDER watching this movie any longer then 30 minutes it was absolutly HORRIBLE. the action was completely unbeliveable the acting was CRAP. it was a downright stupid movie.
3,Get if if you like Segal or DMX,"This movie was typical Segal. No need to explain much more on that. It was a decent movie, with an okay plot, and enough humor thrown in to make it mildly entertaining, but that's about it.DMX plays an introspective thug that just doesn't cut it. The acting looks forced, and you don't believe his character.Tom Arnold is added into the flick for comic relief, and he does his normal stuff.Not much about the movie is original. All the action scenes are predictable, and the only plot twist comes so late in the movie you really don't care anymore.It's not a bad movie, it's just not a great movie. Segal has done better in some of his other flicks."
4,Kung Fu Grip Action,"This is definitely one of Seagal's best one's yet. If you like movies with plenty of action, then this movie is definitely worth a rent. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I was expecting the typical mind numbing butt kicking that Seagal usually puts out. This one actually had a decent story line. I definitely recommmend this one to those of you that are Martial Arts fans and even those who aren't."
2,bad,"Let's see... not only can seagal NOT act, but -as it seems- cannot express emotions (much like chuck norris) nor speak with any life.This movie contains a less than average general plot (with the exception of a few nice twists) and less than average acting.If you are a fan of seagal (why?!) then you might as well pick this one up... if you prefer real acting and a plot at all... look elsewhere."
2,Amazingly cliche,"Exit Wounds is a truly stunning movie -- stunning in that it is so completely without an original thought in its head. Seagal does his usual steely-faced, teeth-gritting, eyebrows narrowing ""acting"" (re: it's Seagal doing, well, Seagal). The most amazing aspect of Exit Wounds is the blatant rip-off of one-liners from other more notable movies. It is also incredibly violent, with a lot of blood for blood's sake. The movie is obviously geared towards the braindead teen- and 20-something and in that sense it succeeds in spades. Exit Wounds also happens to have every Cop Movie cliche in the book. It's quite amazing how they were able to fit in so many cliches in such a short period."
2,If you read the book don't buy the movie,"I read the book first and the movie is very disappointing, unless you are an avid Steven Seagal fan.The movie follows John Westermann's book (same name) in only a couple of areas; it is about the police and some of the character names reappear.The plot and characters in Westermann's book are far more interesting and entertaining than they are in this movie. Also, its humor is very good.If your interest is Westermann read the book. If your interest is Seagal watch the movie before you read the book; otherwise you will wish you had."
4,A great action film,Steven Segal makes a great action comeback in this movie. His last good movie was Under Siege was his last okay movie was The Glimmer Man. This movie is about dirty cops and Segal is trying to bring them down. DMX who is one of the best rapper/actors is also a good co-star. The only let down for me was the fact that Steven and Micheal Jai White didn't have a longer fight scene. All in All this is one of Segal's best and his late good film.
3,3 Stars for Anger Management,"Over weight and over the hill, Steven Seagal had certainly seen better days before EXIT WOUNDS. The film starts out with an interesting premise which it unfortunately does not pursue. The best scene in this entire movie is the anger management sequence where he destroys the desk. Wouldn't we all want to do that at some time?"
2,Not like the good old Seagal's movies...,"This film really disappointed me. I watched it expecting something like the excelent Glimmer Man or Under Siege series, Under Deadly Ground, Above the Law or Out For Justice. But unfortunatly what meant to be a good story, ended meeting Joe Silver, producer of The Matrix, which is an excellent movie. But I trully don't understand why Joe Silver keep insisting in his formula of impossible jumps. This might be the right thing to do when Keanu Reeves or someone else is running the show, but surely it isn't a good thing when Seagal is on the stage. Seagal does not need any ""turbo"" effects to make his fighting nice and thrilling. This film totally screwed up Seagal's talent and his reallistic fighting. The only nice thing in this movie is the end when the fat guy is in a talk show. I really hope that Steven Seagal also noticed this and his next movie will be free of ""Matrix kind"" special effects."
4,Great Movie,This Movie Has Alot Of action. Dmx Has A big Part in this movie unlike romeo must die. If your a dmx fan or a action movie fan i recommend this movie.
3,"Entertaining, but normal Seagal","The movie starts with Seagal's character Boyd, a police officer, rescues the Vice President of the USA from a very elaborate plot. His reward is to demote him to the worst precinct, 15th, in the city. We lose what looks like the beginning of a good plot.The 15th turns out to be a very seedy shop, with more corrupt cops than straight ones looks like our boy Boyd has arrived not a moment too soon. Isaiah Washington plays his awestruck partner, Jill Hennessy is his flinty boss, and hip-hop hero DMX is a mystery man who defeats Seagal in hand-to-hand combat. There is a lot of action, and Seagal fans will love it. The only extra on the DVD worth anything is the Music video; DMX's ""Ain't No Sunshine"""
5,steven Seagal and DMX in EXIT WOUNDS,"Steven Seagal and DMX, now there's a great team!!! EXIT WOUNDS has it all... Action, Adventure, suspence, cars and a lot of good laughs. Definetly one of my picks for movie of the year. This movie is intended for mature audiences and is definetly not meant for young children. Contains violence, cursing, and some nudity."
3,EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS,"A DETROIT COP [STEVEN SEAGAL] TAKES ON CORRUPT COPS. THIS WAS ACTUALLY OK. THE THING THAT HURTS THE MOVIE IS THE FIRST 30 MINUTES, WHICH ARE KINDA MEDIOCRE. BUT ONCE IT GETS PAST THAT, IT'S PRETTY ENTERTAINING. DMX ACTUALLY DID A GOOD ACTING JOB IN THIS. I WILL ADMIT THAT SEAGAL IS KINDA FAT AND I'LL ADMIT THAT HE DOESN'T LOOK AS COOL AS HE USED TO, BUT, IN THIS MOVIE, HE DID SOME PRETTY GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES. THIS MOVIE ALSO PROVES THAT MICHAEL JAI WHITE [WHO PLAYED SPAWN] DESERVES MORE ATTENTION THAN WHAT HE'S CURRENTLY GETTING. I'D SAY THAT THIS MOVIE IS WORTH A WATCH."
4,How 'bout that for Steven's comeback?,"The plot is just a weird, pseudo-intellegent cops-goin'-after-drug-dealers-and-bad-cops-and-kickin'-alotta-[butt]-as-they-go, but Steven Seagal is why you watch it. I particularly loved the scene where the gang is trying to break into his car, and he beats them all senseless. Don't see this film for the riveting ""story"", descent actin acting, or the ridiculously [messed] up soundtrack, headed by the king of bad music, DMX (who may want to consider giving up his day job, since his acting skills are actually exceptional), go to it for the action. After all, isn't that what it's about?"
5,cool and awesome movie!,"this movie is really good it has really cool scenes, seagal is as cool as ever.The action is unbeatable.It is in the top five seagal films.above the law,under siege, under siege 2,on deadly ground, and of course EXIT WOUNDS!"
3,"Good, cheesy fun!!!","Although he&#146;s always been the world&#146;s laziest action star, Steven Seagal shows his age in EXIT WOUNDS. Heck, Seagal even lets himself take some punches this time around.The director, Andrzej Bartkowiak (ROMEO MUST DIE), keeps the action mean and fast, staging fight scenes with lots of different types of weapons. In its cheesy fun way EXIT WOUNDS is efficient, exciting entertainment. Rapper DMX, cast as a drug kingpin who is not what he seems, shows true command. He&#146;s one of the major reasons that this film becomes as entertaining as it does."
5,Most Under-Rated Film of 2001,"If you like Seagal's earlier films from the late eighties and early ninties, and thought the work in recent years has slipped, buy this movie and see the man come swinging & kicking back. Complimented by a convicing DMX, funny Tom Arnold and a kick-[rear] soundtrack, this movie is no doubt the best action flick of 2001."
1,"Oh, well...",Couldn't get it to run in Windows 7. I've had trouble with this on older games. I may have to jump through some hoops to get it to work...LOL
3,Did not like smell,"That's pretty much it - I didn't like the smell and found the color to be a bit much. But this product really has a strong following, so it's really just my personal preference that the pine-like smell is not my thing. The bubbles were good enough, but I felt like I was bathing in floor cleaner due to the scent. I used it to fill the bathroom handsoap dispenser and it works well. But my hands have the lingering scent. This is a good thing if you like the scent, because it does a good job clinging to your skin unlike many bubble baths."
5,"Green, musky, utterly pleasant scent, very high quality soap","This product has been packaged and repackaged for years -- I use this ""Bubble Bath"" as shampoo, body wash, and to make bath salts and scrubs. Horse Chestnuts have a peculiar musky chlorophyl scent that is it's own thing. It isn't mint, or bay, or citrus -- it's musky. But not in a Brut aftershave way. It's subtle, and it combines with men's and women's scents differently. It's in the range of expensive patchouli, but much lighter. It won't make women in spandex spontaneously appear and want you, stupid. But it does smell good."
5,Heavenly,"This product is heavenly. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try, I was not disappointed. If you want a wonderful, relaxing, invigorating bath, give Badedas a try, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
4,Shipment smooth and arrived in good condition.,"Purchased four bottles of Vital Bath through Amazon from Parthenon Foods, Inc. in West Allis, WI.All went very smoothly and package arrived via FedEx in fine condition. I would certainly recommend purchasing products from this vendor. Badedas is not easy to find in the U.S. and once you've used it becomes quit additive!"
3,Badebas - Poor substitute for Vitabath,"I bought 2 bottles based on reviews here. I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Vitabath moisturizing bath & shower gelee. It smells about the same, but is better suited to a bubble bath than a shower gel. It is drying to the skin when used as a bath gel, which I believe is due to the propylene glycol. Most of the organics found in Vitabath seem to be missing.Vitabath Original Spring Green moisturizing bath & shower gel (partial list): Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Lanolin Oil.Badedas: Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, that's about it for the Badedas.In short, Badedas smells good, has cool German label, but I really miss the Vitabath. If I were using it in a bath rather than a shower, I'd probably be more pleased. I'm using it up, but hope to find a sale on Vitabath one day soon, and use this as a backup."
5,The Best,I have used this product for many years. A soaking in its suds is both refreshing and relaxing and I have not found its equal with any other bubble bath.
2,Definitely NOT Vitabath,"I purchased Badedas because I have loved Vitabath for many years and was assured that Badedas was virtually identical. As it costs signifcantly less, and there have been complaints about the quality of recent purchases of Vitabath, I thought it was worth a try. While both are thick green bath gels, the smell is very different. Vitabath has a light, clean, refreshing scent while Badedas has strong musky undertones that I can only describe as smelling like a combination of stale sweat and cheap perfume. I do realize what smells good or bad can be highly subjective, and many truly seem to like the scent of Badedas but it definitely does NOT smell like Vitabath and if you purchase it as a substitute you will most likely be disappointed. I find the smell unpleasant enough to render my purchase useless. (My husband concurs, so it's not just me!)"
5,What took me so long?!?,"I kept seeing this brand on Smallflower's website and on Amazon. I can't believe I didn't try it sooner. The whole family loves it! Not subtle, but not overpowering either. I will be recommending Badedas to family and friends. And I'll be buying more before this one runs out!"
1,Green bubbles....weird!,It smells way to much like intense chemicals and its green... witch is kind of weird but the smells is intense and its not very soothing or relaxing...not sure why it has alot of good reviews but it stinks ! I was itching alot afterward and smelled like it.going with an organic choice instead!
5,World's best shower gel,"This is the stuff....world's best shower gel. Nothing like it made in the USA. It's a common product in Germany, but nothing like it in U.S."
5,Have loved for years,"I love this bubble bath, and have found it increasingly hard to find at an affordable price. I was pleased to find it here and will continue to order."
4,Catchy - but not his best work.,"I enjoyed quite a few songs on this album. However, I prefer his earlier work (The American, Wonder Bar). This album seemed to have a bit more ""filler"" to it. I prefer his basic songs with an emphasis on vocals. My favorite songs on this album are ""Failure,"" and ""Still Think About You."" I would recommend this album to seasoned Sexton fans, not to a first-time Sexton buyer."
4,"Nice sound, live is better","I'm a great fan of Martin Sexton and for a long time he has been one of my favorite, if not my only favorite, musicians. I especially adore and cherish all the music on Live Wide Open and The American.This album I think is good, however I'm not as into the lyrics as on previous CDs. I don't think an artist can continue to write stupediously insightful and interesting lyrics all the time and my love of Martin surely makes this CD wonderful. I only wish that he had more songs where he plays solo, just guitar and his beautiful voice."
4,Typical Martin......,"Unlike everyone else who has written a post about this album, I have heard most of it live already (his first US tour stop in Philadelphia). In typical Martin Sexton fashion, some of this album is incredibly beautiful and played just the same in concert, while some of it played live almost ruins the studio version by being so awesome. Particularly, ""Failure"" and ""Will It Go Round In Circles"".I saw him live before hearing the album, but am almost glad that I did. I don't know that I ever want to hear another version of ""Still Think About You"" after hearing it on the album (he did not perform it live). I can't stop listening to it and think it is certainly one of the prettiest songs I've ever heard of his."
3,where's the voice?,"Martin Sexton has one of the most incredible voices i have ever heard; but not on this CD. if you want the best Martin Sexton out there, then get Live Wide Open, nothing else comes close. He is at his best when his vocals soar. Great artists showcase their talent. Martin's talent is his voice. It is unfortunate that this CD doesnt do his voice justice, it is just too reserved."
2,Catchy tunes but uninspired vocals,"After all those years of hearing Martin perform live (since 1989 in that church basement in Worcester, MA)...when you hear this recording you just want to grab him, shake him, and yell, ""SING!"" The performer who has blown us all away with that amazing, soaring voice, refuses to put his trademark energy into any of these tunes. I don't know why, and it's very frustrating. The tunes are catchy, and several lend themselves to be taken ""out"" a bit...you can feel it coming...then it doesn't happen. Those who have never seen Martin live may enjoy the music: it is not bad at all...it's just not Martin."
4,ShuQi,"First, she was a Beauty Queen in HongKong 20 years ago. She then made some movies. It is not popular for a Chinese Star to appearnaked even by today's standard. The video showed her beauty naked on a beach, not porn-type. Take her waistline: Above is clear.Below is blurry. The remaining two thirds were flash-backs dating from her lingerie-model career in Taiwan.Overall, this video is about a young and beautiful body. For her fans, it is a ""must"" collection. For other movie goers, it isworth the money."
4,focus on the mountain stages please,"Well, the coverage starts of rather monotonously by covering the sprint finishes in the early stages, and did justice to the fact that Cippolini broke the record. I'd liked to have seen more coverage of individual teams and explanations of the tactics as well used by them. Needless to say I've watched the set about three times already. Good buy."
4,TDF 99 - An American In Paris,"Good coverage of Armstrong's amazing time trials and in-depth footage of the mountain stages. The angles from the motorcycle cameras are up close and personal - simply amazing. It would have been nice if more information were available about the top teams, but nonetheless inspiring news coverage of this demanding tour and the unbelievable strength of the participating athletes. A valuable addition to the library of any cycling fan."
3,OK,"I'm terrible I bought this book because a friend recommended it to me and I just haven't been able to follow through it. But, I am also bad at reading fitness books. It has found a good use as a nice prop when sifling beer out."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This CD,"CDs of music from the real Military artists are available for free directly from the Office of the US Army Band at Fort Meyer, Virginia. The Military is prohibited from selling recordings, does not sanction this release and is required by Congress to make their recordings available to all Americans free of charge.So why waste your money on this 3rd rate recording? If you actually want to purchase a recording of patriotic music now, I would recomend ""The Spirit of Freedom"" by the Washington Men's Camerata on the Gothic label or Robert Shaw's Battle Cry of Freedom on the RCA label (""Battle Cry of Freedom"" is a nice recording but is dated and is not nearly as good as ""The Spirit of Freedom"" (which is featured in the new PBS series ""Freedom: A History of US"")"
4,good marching stuff,a good cd typical of the forces music brings back nostalgia toany retired service person
2,"For scholars, all for scholars and nothing but for scholars.","I tried and did my best in order to read the book. After reading 80 pages, I jumped till the end. I came to the conclusion that the author had effected an exhaustive review of the literature on the matter in order to defend that Western families, after all, had been not so different from other types of Eurasian families. But he did it in such a dry way that only if one is an expert or really cranky about the matter one may bear the book."
5,Stunning and amazing...,"Like an earlier reviewer, this is my first GBV album... and quite simply, I'm blown away by it. It's easily one of the best CDs I've heard this year. I doubt it matters whether or not I'm an indie ""guru"" or a connoisseur of modern music... all that matters to me is that I have found a truly amazing CD and group, and I intend to go listen to as many of their CDs as I can find. Thank you, Robert Pollard, for making such a great CD."
4,Continuing to evolve.,"It's only logical that as the band members constantly change so too will the sound of the band. Adding a legendary pop rock producer doesn't hurt either. Even though some of the endearing weirdness that was present on ""Mag Earwhig"" is gone this record is really solid and a credit to Robert Pollard's songwriting."
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"It's to to wake up and smell the vinyl, kids. Bob Pollard's latest aggregate of musicians continues to single handedly destroy the myth of what was once the greatest band in the land. Nowadays Pollard thinks he's writing epic sagas when in reality he's merely recycling old Uriah Heep songs (and doing a poor job at that). The classic Teenage FBI (from the Wish In One Hand EP) sounds as if it was an outtake from HeadEast's Flat As A Pancake. Who was the genuis who thought Ric Ocasek was a smart move? Pollard has lost the magic and it appears as long as Cobre Verde remains involved the magic will never come back. Sorry Bob, but this note ain't for me."
2,Disappointing,"After listening to ""Mag Earwhig!"" over and over for a few months, I was eager to hear more of Robert Pollard's songs. I wanted to hear the new stuff before I started to work my way backward into the catalogue. ""Do the Collapse"" came out just in time.This album is supposed to be a step up --- better sound, a real producer, etc. But GBV albums seem to stand or fall on the songwriting, not the production. On ""Do the Collapse,"" everything is slick and nothing sticks. The hooks are as sincere as a Backstreet Boys record. Every song is forgettable. If you're a HUGE fan of Robert Pollard, this will satisfy you. But if you're just looking for another great pop album, this ain't it."
5,"Bob, dude! You rule!","Although the Ric Ocasek keyboards on ""Teenage FBI"" sound sorta out of place, I think this ranks among the strongest of GVB's albums. If you liked Alien Lanes or UTBUTS you'll like this."
3,gbv hi-fi???,"wow, never thought i'd see the day...gbv hi-fi??? sounds like they have sold out, but they haven't...bob keeps us guessing...for all of us hardcore gbv fans, this is a new step...however, it is a step i am willing to take...this album is great...never doubt bob...I MISS TOBY"
3,"it's ok, but...","it really isn't as good as the other albums. all the stars on this page have been earned by the back catalogue and the live performances. it sounds like bob hasn't listened to the white album for years. he used to invent new forms of melody; now he recycles his own and other people's. his lyrics used to be weirdly involving; now they seem really impersonal, like the words have been picked out of some lotto machine. listen to chicken blows next to wrecking now or tractor rape chain next to surgical focus. there's no comparison. he's losing it, and it's sad. but gbv are still one of the top ten bands of all time."
4,hooky freaky,"I admit, I am largely unfamiliar with the works of GBV but if this is unlike their other stuff, then they must be getting really good. This CD is full of wacky word play which matters little to me. Lyrics generally just fill space anyway. They are secondary to the music, which is extremely whistle-able here. If only I could write slabs of hook laden guitar pop like this...ah. Get it."
4,Do The Collapse--GBV fully realized,"Get this record! I was quite skeptical when I heard that this album was produced by Ric Ocasek-I assumed it would be full of mediocre over-produced radio songs. However, it is what GBV does best--full of melodic, melancholy songs which are now fully developed. Alien Lanes stands as my favorite album--nothing can beat the emotional draw of songs like 'As We go Up We go Down"". And, I doubt they can ever top the stark intensity of ""Goldheart Mountaintop...."" from Bee Thousand, but Do The Collapse is fantastic--especially ""Dragons Awake."" If only Tobin Sprout would return....."
3,It's mediocre. But not because of Hi-Fi,"The reason this album is mediocre has NOTHING to do with the fact it's not Lo-Fi. Anyone who truly knows Pollard's work could tell you there's a much deeper problem here: the songs just aren't that great. There's just no magic to them. They don't make you sit up at night wondering how Bob does it. I know that's a pretty high standard - but older GBV did it in spades. Yes, I'm a GBV old schooler. But that's because the songs were incredible - not because they were recorded on a four track."
3,some of the songs on this cd are pretty good,"i am a new comer to the world of gbv.i probably would have never known the group if somebody hadnt pass me the buffy the vampire slayer CD on which was featured the cars influenced TEENAGE FBI.i liked the song right away and wanted to discover the group s other songs.i ve never been into weird song lyrics (i ve never heard their tractor rape chain or kicker of elves but those titles really don t inspire me)so if this album is more commercial and has less word weirdness,that s ok with me. i won t say that this album is a masterpiece but some of the songs(SURGICAL FOCUS,LIQUID INDIAN,MUSHROOM ART,ZOO PIE and HOLD ON HOPE)are very catchy and powerful.i hope that gbv keeps going in that direction for their next albums."
2,why did i buy this?,"well i just listened to this album and in between the meaningless lyrical nonsense and the poorly-done atonal experiments, i'm not sure if i remember any of the songs or if i enjoyed any of this album. i bought it because of ocasek / weezer and GBV / ponyoak connections, but I'll stick with weezer and ponyoak, this album is nonsense!"
4,Has GBV sold out? I don't care... this is a great album,"While accusation swirl about ""selling out"" they should fall on deaf ears, since those same ears should be listening to this album. I had written GBV off after the very lackluster ""Mag Earwig"" album which seemed to abandon the quirkyness of their previous material. ""Do the Collapse"" is a return to form of sorts, but stretches out their songs so that they play for more than 45 seconds and keeps the emotion intact. Take ""alien lanes"" and polish it up to a major label standard then you got this album right here. A good effort all around."
3,Buy Hold on Hope EP Instead,"This is an OK GbV album, but isn't anything too grand. I was expecting more from that Cars producer guy. Some of the things on here are unlistenable to me. Buy the Hold on Hope EP instead...there are no bad songs on that at all and they all rock and it's strange how they were from the same sessions and they turned out better than the LP. This major label debut is full of ""mehs"" and the awkward songs like the weird version of ""Teenage FBI""...but yeah...enough putting this record down.There are some awesome songs on here though like the awesome pop tune ""Surgical Focus"", ""Things I Will Keep"", ""Dragons Awake"", the short ""Mushroom Art"", the cool ""Unmarketed Product"", the obscure ""Zoo Pie"", ""Hold on Hope"" and etc.Heck this is still worth owning if you enjoy GbV, there's just some weird stuff on here and it just isn't that great. It's just ain't even Mag Earwhig or even close to the classic lo-fi. Plus the EP is better than the LP..that's just strange...3.25 stars."
3,"Pretty good songs, but it could be more consistent","OK - I admit, I'm new to the GBV thing, even though I have a Clevelend guitar connection to Doug Gillard (I think he replaced me in Suspect Device, after I left CLE). Anyway, I love one song on this CD. It is Surgical Focus. It is the perfect power pop song with great rhythm and lead guitar, a cool bass riff, and great vocals. Good job guys!"
4,Upon further review...,"As a long time GBV fan, I hated this when it came out in 1999. It wasn't the production that bothered me, I thought the songs were weak, especially when up against the brillant standard set by ""Bee Thousand and ""Alien Lanes"". I puleed it out tonight and I still don't like ""Teenage FBI"" and ""Zoo Pie"", which unfortunately open the album. They sound like filler to me, not album openers. However, there is not another clunker on the disc, and some absolute gems. Many have commented on ""Surgical Focus and ""Liquid Indian"", and I agree that those are two of the best. My favorite, however, is the final 1-2 punch of ""Picture me Big Time"" and ""An Unmarketed Product"". A gorgeous tune followed by 63 seconds of tuneful bedlam. Magnificent."
4,"Chunky, catchy rock","Having heard so many great things about Guided By Voices I finally stumbled across Do The Collapse in the USA. Foaming with anticipation, I was disappointed to find the album sounded like Foo Fighters or Sugar -- plenty of chunky guitar fuzz and strong tunes, but little variation in the sound. With Ric Ocasek producing, I realised their sound had been streamlined somewhat, but the tunes were incredibly strong and stuck in my head for days.I've now tracked the album down and my initial disappointment has given way to absolute addiction. This is a cracking rock record. 'Teenage FBI', 'Surgical Focus' and 'Hold On Hope' are impeccable singles, stuffed full of hooks and harmonies. Elsewhere even typically strange GBV song titles such as 'Much Better Mr Buckles' and 'Strumpet Eye' can't disguise the instinctively brilliant songwriting of Robert Pollard.Not as good a GBV album as some of their earlier stuff, but still worth checking out if you bow down the altar of the pop/rock song."
4,40% Great Hooks; 60% Interesting Weirdness,". . . in other words, a typical GBV album. Ocasek's production is fine with me: less murky, more rocking. Only geeks would complain about the sound quality.One point no one else has made: the best song is ""Surgical Focus."" It's so odd that none of these songs get played on the radio."
2,Disappointing,"I have owned the Brother MFC6800 for around 4 years now. Most of this time has been related to living with compromises. This machine has performed below my expectations over the long term. Here are some reasons why:1. Scanning is too slow. The scanner seems to scan inch by inch. For every inch it moves forward, it jumps back a half inch. The quality of the scan is great though.2. After the first toner and drum wore off, I have had a miserable time getting the replacements to work. I tried Brothers toner and drum and later, some from ABC ink. These are very expensive (high cost of ownership). Whatever I printed or copied had streaks or too much greys in them. Some forums I visited said that cheaper alternatives do not work with Brother's products.3. The machine makes a significant amount of noise when warming up to print.I am in the market for a laser MFC now and will be avoiding purchasing a Brother. Probably will lean towards a HP or a Canon."
1,Unhappy with this item,"1) Awesomely cumbersome software and operation, 2) poor quality copies with one edge always dark (new drum & cartridge did not fix this), 3) no envelope tray, 4) scans of photos come out distorted, 5) poor quality instructions and troubleshooting, 6) expensive drum replacement. Take my advice, buy something else."
5,A delightful new world,"With Merlin's Kin, Everett Coles took me into a world I once dreamed of, filled with strange and beautiful creatures,fair maidens and chivalrous deeds. But more than that he made me believe it.The story builds slowly as it tells how the teenagers got there, into Greensward, and how they have no idea how to leave or why they are there. It shows them making friends and enemies in equal measure until the group are separated and the story gathers pace.By the end I was quite breathless with the pace, with wonderfully worked plot changes and the power of the Ley lines bringing out its own sort of magic. So much more satifying than Harry Potter not as dark as Pullman when is the next one due?"
1,Bogus,"At the time of Elvis' death I was a firefighter on the Memphis Fire Department. The Paramedics who attended Elvis and transported him to Baptist Hospital were friends of mine. Another friend worked at Memphis Funeral Home and assisted in preparing Elvis' body, including embalming, bathing him and dressing him. I'd rather believe my friends over any attention-seeking-money-whore out there. Ladies and Gentlemen, Elvis is still in the grave at Graceland!"
5,Awesome! Loved it!,"My brother turned me on to this dvd and the cd. I have to say, I read a lot of articles about Elvis being dead and why it was ""impossible"" for him to be alive.Convinced he was dead, I told my brother I would keep and open mind watching the dvd and listening to the cd. I started out listening to the cd, and was pleasantly surprised. If this IS an imposter, it's the absoulte best I've heard! Awesome cd! Love it!!! Now on to the dvd. This dvd answers ALL of your questions about how this could even be possible that Elvis could be alive. There is too much to get into in detail, I would like to say, however, if you have any doubt that it's remotely possible for this to be true, get the cd and dvd, and keep an open mind. The music is great, the dvd informative and it gives us hope that the ""King"" may just come back one day! Enjoy! I did."
2,Elvis in the shadows,"If u are looking to see Elvis look again. This documentary has Elvis in the shadows, u never see his face. I like the documentary but was disapointed in not seeing his face so that I could judge for myself, the voice was his and he had a lot of knowledge about Elvis, but my conclusion is, still don't know."
3,Elvis Found Alive,I just don't know if I believe this story. It wasn't as stupid as I thoughtit was going to be. Interesting.
1,Don't waste your money,I'm a bis Elvis fan and this is one of the worst garbage I have ever seen.A complete total waste of time.
1,Elvis Found Alive??!,"What a total waste of time. I don't know how he can do a ""documentary"" stating that Elvis Presley is in it, when clearly he is not.I'm pretty sure Graceland won't appreciate it. They do hold the copyright on Elvis's name, image, and likeness. And they won't appreciate this pile of bol**cks.If you watch this you are seriously disturbed or just want to waste some of your time. You could be watching the real Elvis singing. Give me ""The 68 Comeback Special"", ""That's The Way It Is"", ""Aloha from Hawaii"" or ""Elvis on Tour"". Now those have the real king in them. Not cr*p fake rubbish like this DVD."
4,Has Elvis really left the building?,"Elvis fans unite! Has Elvis really left the building? You can be the judge and the conspiracy theorists' can be the jury! The beginning is a little off kilter and a bit slow to build. Love the antidote with ink-stained hands...Beyond the beginning is an intricately woven tale that wraps one in belief and disbelief. Fact or fiction? An all-American guy just living the dream? Illusions' sweet smoke screen? A government cover-up? Who's to know! Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the ride. Are you ready to drink the kool-aid?"
1,Give it a miss!!,This film is very misleading and is as fake as can be..it clearly states starring Elvis Presley which is a pack of lies..its not Elvis talking or singing..its a total fake..give it a miss and spend your extra money on popcorn..you will enjoy it more !!!!
1,Amazon is Misleading people!,"Amazon is misleading people and damaging and legacy of Elvis by putting Elvis as the one who is acting in this Movie. Elvis is not in this movie and should not be credited to him. It uses an Elvis imitator to mock Elvis and those people and events in his life. From a guy who made a silly movie in 2011 to 'prove' Paul McCartney is dead, the absurdity of this movie speaks for itself. Amazon need to remove the credit to Elvis and have the actor as unknown since this is a very controversial movie that will offend lots of people."
1,RIDICULOUS!!!!!,"This ridiculous movie is a total disgrace. There is absolutely no truth to ANY of it whatsoever! To label it as a ""documentary"" is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, just to lure in Elvis fans, and it is illegal. Anyone with a brain can tell that it is NOT Elvis singing or talking in this movie. Don't waste your time or money buying this dumb movie.Joel Gilbert, you are a disgrace to the film industry and Elvis fans everywhere to create such nonsense about the greatest entertainer and human being of all time. SHAME ON YOU!!"
1,elvis is dead,what how can they make a dvd like this......shame on you......why not make a dvd and tell us that dracula is for real.....talk about sick people......get a real job!!!!!
1,Elvis Presley Is Dead,Elvis Presley Is Dead Not Alive. The Person That Came Up With This Is Trying To Fool The Public. Don't Waste Your Money On This Tall Tale Video It Would Not Be Worth It.
1,WTF??????,The WUO threatening to kill Elvis? The Obama Administration is preventing him from resurfacing? What right wing conspiratorial trailer park nuts came up with this idea over a twelve pack of Budweiser??
4,Wierd and interesting,Could this be true? Who knows but some of the information revealed I NEVER HEARD BEFORE. So just for that reason I would watch it again.
2,Awfullllll,"Made my wife and I sit halfway through, what a waste of time. I truly think it is valuable loss of useful time to watch a second of this. We both love Elvis, he is from our generation,"
3,In answer to dvd Elvis found Alive.,there are a few things that didn't add up for instance his favorite food growing up was deep fried peanut butter banana sandwiches not mashed potatoes and sauerkraut mixed together no. two the reason he died his hair black was at that time most leading men had black hair and it is well known even from him that the reason he died his hair black was because his favorite actor tony curtis had black hair. that was just two reasons.
3,Stupid,wish i never bought this it was pretty stupid. the gentlemen that was to be Elvis they Never showed his face and nothing he told was not public knowlege. Dont buy it it is a waste of your money
1,Laughable!,"I am a huge Elvis fan and I love the man and miss his music dearly. But lets be realistic people and realise the fact that Elvis Presley[respectfully] died in 1977. Elvis has been gone nearly 35 years! Let the man rest in peace and lets just enjoy the music that he shared with us. Besides if he was found alive wouldnt it be the biggest news in this world since the invention of Television? People look up Wikipedia! Elvis did indeed passed away in August 16, 1977!"
3,okay,Not sure if this was supposed to be facts or fiction. I am an Elvis fan and did not believe what I was seeing. Appeared to be a repeat of Forrest Gump movie. Some of it was almost believable.
1,Bad Bad,"Just not that great, would not bother even if you are a devoted fan to the king of rock and roll"
3,The story of a great woman...,"""The Rich shall Inherit"" is the story of one remarkable woman, who rebuilt her life after it was shattered by the men of her life. Poppy Mallory is the center of this story, and we see what happens to her in flashback. Mike Preston is the award-winning journalist who finds himself intrigued by Poppy's story, and tries to find Poppy's heir. But first, he has to unravel decades-old secrets, and get to the root of who her illegitamate children were. There is a pleasant mix of characters, all with their own motivations to see who the true heir(s) are. Thick book, but you'll breeze through it."
4,Very good.,"Very good, intrguing, interesting. The plot, although complicated, was fun to follow. The author's writing style is easy to understand."
4,One of the best voices at all..,"As far as the quality of the music goes, this is a well produced, fun album (as opposed to brilliant). And this is the only reason I'm not giving the album 5 stars; However, most of the songs are very good.Giorgia however, is brilliant. Her voice rivals any singer you may think of. But the ""gist"" and the personality that comes through, and the way she uses her voice is unrivaled. The music is not in function of flaunting her vocal capabilities, as it appears in the later albums of Mariah Carrey or Whitney Houston. The music, the songs, and her voice make a balanced, harmonious ONE. This is Giorgia's music and she's ""in it"" voice, heart, and soul. If you understand italian, the lyrics are beautiful too, especially the song ""come saprei"" - a moving love song by a woman to a man. Hats off Giorgia!!"
4,a gem of a collection...,"this is a nice ""greatest hits"" compilation....the best track of all, and the hardest to find...until now...is the extended version of ""We Take Mystery To Bed""....this alone was worth the cd purchase....the sound quality is very nice as well...."
2,But for one track...,"Okay, yeah, we've heard it all before; for a musician with ""limited"" appeal, there sure are a hell of a lot of compilations out there, and every one of them has ""Cars"", ""Are 'Friends' Electric?"", ""Down In The Park"", blah blah blah. Most will be mastered better than this, although the remastering is not bad at all. The only reason why this should be noted, for completely mad die-hard Numan fans, is that the version of ""We Take Mystery (To Bed)"" is the 12"" version, which I have not been able to find anywhere else. Everything else is as you remember it, only not so much so. But for the mix of ""WTM(TB)"", you shouldn't care."
2,A Little Too Much,"This is a collection of non-fiction articles focused on environmental injustices that Carl Hiaasen wrote about over the past several years. As a Floridian, I lived through much of what he wrote about. Hiaasen's incredible wit paints a disturbing picture of the follies of the Politicians we Floridians have mindlessly voted into office. During the first few pages I laughed pretty hard. But then he kept reminding me time and time again about what we've allowed to happen to our state, to the point where the book got depressing. I supposed I took it too much to heart, and this became the first Hiaasen book I could not finish."
1,Short stories - be aware,"I was disappointed.. This book contains lots of short stories - somewhat funny, but not at all good reading compared to his earlier books. I'd stay away from this book if I'd known in advance"
3,"Witty and biting, but dated and geo-specific","I have read several of Hiaasen's novels and have enjoyed them immensely. From reading this collection of his columns, I now know where he gets many of his ideas for characters and ridiculous plotlines. Truth is truly stranger than fiction in South Florida! Developers run amok, politicians are on the take from everyone, criminals of all stripes don't even bother to hide what they're doing. Hiaasen exposes it all in his inimitably sarcastic way. I did enjoy many of the columns and appreciated Hiaasen's skill. However, most of the columns were from several years ago, with many of them being from the 80s. Also, not having spent a lot of time in South Florida, I couldn't always relate to the issues at hand. I would probably have been satisfied with a collection half as long. But I did enjoy reading about the madness that is life as usual in South Florida."
2,Not a novel,"This is a collection of columns from the Miami Herold. Some reflect the type of writing and humor in his novels, (I think I have red all of them.) but most are diatribes against local corruption. I place this book slightly above his book on trying to go back to golf, which was pretty tiresome. I love his novels, but this in not one of them."
2,Carl Hiaasen's Miami Herald gr. hits,"If you're expecting a novel from Carl in the style for which he has become known for, you're in for a big let down. But if you want to read a collection of someone's idea of what his best work has been at his regular job at the Miami Herald, then you're at the right place. Personally, I was not that gratified by this book, but then again, my expectations were completely different for what this was about. Carl Hiaasen is still one of my favorite authors and one of my favorite people. I love this guy."
1,Don't let a cancer patient read this one!!!,This book is dated in its information. Since this book was published there have been approved chemotherapy agents (Alimta) and the prognosis has gotten alot better. I am very sorry that I let my dad read this book. It took days to get over the depression.
4,Good product!,I use this to 'kick-up' my morning oatmeal and I like the product very much! I'll be reordering when this order runs low.Thanks!
3,why this book lost two stars,"I'd have given this book five stars, if not for the title's seriously fractured English. Calling its subjects ""autism heroes"" reeks of the same depersonalized nonsense we would produce if we called President Obama a ""blackness man"" or labeled Julie Andrews a ""musicality woman."""
5,Wonderful!,"Thank you, thank you, Jennifer Elder, for writing this book. It's a wonderful tribute to those who are ASD, no matter what area they might be in on the spectrum. I have a child who is high-functioning ASD, and he has an extremely good prognosis. I bought this book hoping that someday he might ask about other people who are a little bit different, just like him.My son's name? Quinn."
3,"Entertaining, yet a weak effort from Hamsun.","August is the 2nd of 3 books in the August series. This novel pretty much stands alone in the works of Knut Hamsun. The novel doesn't really say much or do much, merely reporting furthur antics of August. While entertaining & enjoyabe (and a favorite among Norweigens), August is a definate letdown from all other Hamsun works I have read (Cultural Life...) aside."
4,Impressive so far,"Happy with this product so far, I put it to the test on a few days with a few hours of burning and lightscribing."
5,Got it! Love it!! You gotta have it!!!,"Have been listening to Becks on YouTube and SoundCloud and loving her spunky, soulful, lyrics. Can sooo relate to this woman! Great listening for brightening up your day, chilling out with a good vino, or letting your hair down and enjoying an evening wearing out the floor boards whilst deafening your dogs, lol. I was blissed to find new tracks I'd never heard before as well as my favs. This album is timeless fun from the sensationally sassy, sweet tones of Beck's beautiful voice. Highly reccomend this album for any woman, any age, loved every minute of it!!!Big Trouble (Lots of Fun)"
3,Big Trouble (Lots of Fun),"I bought this CD for the Big Trouble (Lots of Fun)song. I couldn't find it anywhere else. So, for that it was a really great find. The sound quality of the CD was rather bad though."
3,???,"I purchased this cd as ""new"". When I received this it was previously opened and the title track ""Big Trouble"" was ""scratchy"" like you hear on an old record recording. Lots of pops and scratches. Is the the song ""Big Trouble"" originally recorded this way? Is there anyone who has a copy noticed this? Please let me know.Big TroubleThanks! -D"
5,"Big Trouble, Lots of Fun","Excellent vendor! Received product much sooner then expected. CD was just as described, brand new and in original packageing. I had trouble finding this CD and really only wanted one song off of it, but I found that I liked all the songs! Would definitely buy from this seller again."
3,silly fun,I liked it but I don't think I would pay more than 15 bucks for a copy. The part where his family are pretending to eat was hilarious. It's very silly but falls in line with the rest of Mr. Varney's work.
2,Not his best,"This has become an expensive collectors item, without cause, except that it is hard to find. It is a collection of 5 shorts,none great, 2 okay, one tolerable, and 2 that are terrible. Varney's video ""Your World as I see it"" is much funnier, and shows more diversity."
2,Forgettable,It hasn't been that long since I rented this movie and I have already forgotten the thing. That might provide a clue as to how good a movie this is. I streamed it via Roku after paying Amazon for the privilege and though I think I paid less than $3.00 to rent it I still feel a bit ripped off.I cannot recommend this movie in any way.
2,Poor Version of 28 Days Later,"This could have been a really good sci-fi movie, but it attempts to be ""Dawn of the Dead"" at the end. And fails miserably. It's more watchable than the Sci-Fi network's wreck of the week, but not by much. Good actors hamstrung by an awful script. Actually, I may have to take that Sci-Fi statement back. At least you know what's going on, (and probably know the whole movie), within the first few minutes. This piece of dreck doesn't seem to know where it's going or what's it's all about until half way through this slog. Confused about the first 2 minutes of the film? Don't worry. It ties back in somewhere toward the end. Assuming you want to wait that long to find out. Even if it was free, you're better off re-watching ""Night of the Living Dead"". You'll feel dead after watching this crap."
1,A good bedtime story,"If you are looking for a good movie to watch at bedtime about a bunch of doctors walking around a hospital, then this movie is for you. Thats basically all that happens in this movie; NOTHING.If you watch this movie, here is what you will get - Sleepy"
1,Aroberts,"Let me start off by saying I love horror movies...especially zombie flix. I have seen many good and even more bad horror movies, and often times I can appeiate the ones that are so great. There is usually some entertainment value. I have to say this is the worst zombie movie I have ever seen, and one of the worst movies. It was so boring; the acting was aweful; they threw things in that made no sense {random girl/girl kiss for example). I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. The only excitement was in the last few minuts, but it was so bad that you would just be excited it was almost over (that is if you made it this far). There was not even a minimal level of enjoyment...and I can usually find something to appreciate in most movies."
1,NOT GOOD - POOR ACTING - no zombies till last 15 mins.,"I have to believe the positive reviews on this are fake... poor acting - low budget (which can still work but, not in this case) no zombies till last 15 minutes... weak... and I love zombie flicks... but, certainly not this one..."
3,Next Yakuza Movie: Okinawa,A next movie of yakuza and some sexy hints while murdering and killing for a better life without job but on crime proceedings.It is not the best seen from this famous producer.
4,Sonatine,"Sonatine is a great film on all fronts. Quite different from many other Yakuza-genre films, Sonatine tends to take more of subtle and effecting itinerary than the more common violence blazing, action-oriented routes. This film is far from voided of any violence, but it uses it affectingly: in droves or dispersed, that's all the really matters. Takeshi Kitano is always excellent (from Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence to MXC :); he alone can make a film worth watching. He doesn't need to in this one though; an all a round outstanding film :)."
1,Sonatine ranks among the worst movies I have seen.,"There are reputable reviewers that give Sonatine high marks for subtlety, terse dialogue, and hypnotic scenes. A better way to say it is that the characters don't say much, they sit around waiting, they walk around like sticks until they briefly shoot at each other at close range. They seem like they are in a trance and don't seem to care whether they live or die. We get to feel like the characters - totally bored. (And, I had difficulty reading the sub-titles.)I don't get it. I am on another planet from those who rave about this film. Critics must have to go to a special film school that teaches you to see magic where there is nothing. There is so little here that the film becomes whatever you wish to project onto it. This movie is close to a zero."
2,The Hollow men,"Easily one of the most vaccuous movies in recent memory. Only for those fans who misjudge the empty silences between explicable action or dialogue as fraught with profound implications. This movie is nothing but a pretentious yakuza flick. The gunfights are cheesy (they go off like cap-guns), the acting is wooden (Kitano especially, who possibly has two expressions to choose from), and the characterization is completely arbitrary. And if I see one more movie glorifying another gangster, whether or not he has the heart of a poet, I'm doing something rash like joining the NRA."
1,Con by the reviewers,"Watch foreign films three to four times a week. Read the jacket review on Sonatine and selected for view. The worst acted, worst directed, worst edited foreign film I ever viewed. I generally fined merit in most reviews, these reviewers should be boycotted."
2,confusion......,"i did not realize my error until i retraced my order.i did not want, song of the marines.i thought i was ordering the music of the marines.the cd was part of a tribute to my marine corps vietnam veteran husband who is currently in a nursing home....due to agent orange.that is what i get for not double checking myself.the cd is fine it is just alot of music that he did not recognize.so sad as it was for an early acknowledgment of the marine corps birthday.he is fiercely proud of the corps and all his military brothers.thank you for this chance to state my view."
2,Meh,"I got this thing, and I must have miscalculated the measurements, because it's huge! It's almost as wide as my hallway! My puppy has no interest in it, and it's not very easy to clean the grate, so we just took the grate off. I really wanted this to work, too, because I don't like the idea of my puppy pooping and peeing on papers that leak onto my floor, but she seems to like that idea a lot more than using this thing."
2,"May work for other dogs, but not mine.",I researched this product and thought it would be the right product for my dog. Could be the move from a house to an apartment is a bit much. Maybe he would adjust to it soon.
3,only half a year,"I enjoyed the characters and the story in SOPHOMORE YEAR... Erik struggling with an absent military father and a passive mother... Isabelle thriving as her art is expanding... Both navigating the confusing waters of young love. The premise is a great one and I look forward to the rest of the series. In many ways, I feel that Miss Wallace is truly compassionate with her characters, she writes from a place of truth, either her own or her students. I know this. because this story is similar to my own coming out story. My biggest criticism of this novel is that it ends at New Year's Eve... It's an incredibly romantic scene, but am I going to miss out on the next six months until they go back to school? Kim, don't do that to me..."
5,One More of The Long Series of Tormé-Shearing Collaboration,"Another master CD on vocal performance and piano playing. One of the live dates by Tormé and Shearing for Concord Records. Please don't count on anyone serious to choose only one of these CDs. Buy all. This CD specially offers a sensational medley based on ""New York, New York"" where all songs are played backed by the same rhythm bars which opens ""New York ..."". Great, Intelligent, Creative."
5,Must buy for superior SACD Surround,I preface this with the notion that I have an excellent 6.1 system that is seldom provided recorded materialto totally dazzle a listener.Pounce on this for total enjoyment.Max YoungRichmond VA
4,READ THIS BOOK,"Five Years After tells the story of what happened to the welfare recipients who participated in the influential welfare-to-work experiments conducted by several states in the mid-1980s. The authors review the distinctive goals and procedures of evaluations performed in Arkansas, Baltimore, San Diego, and Virginia, and then examine five years of follow-up data to determine whether the initial positive impact on employment, earnings, and welfare costs held up over time. The results were surprisingly consistent. Low-cost programs that saved money by getting individuals into jobs quickly did little to reduce poverty in the long run. Only higher-cost educational programs enabled welfare recipients to hold down jobs successfully and stay off welfare."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"The movie Escape to Witch Mountain was a childhood favorite. I was thrilled to gain access to the book. Unfortunately, the book was not nearly as intriguing as the movie. I agree with most of the changes that the movie director made in order to progress the film and keep the audience's attention. I recommend the book only if you are a hardcore fan of the movie and want to read the book that inspired it."
4,interesting look at multidimensions,"To an extent simplified, but gives a good start. See Hugh Ross' ""Beyond the Cosmos"" for more on multidimensions and its implications for religion."
3,Math Lite,"In his latest book, Pickover treats his readers to a lightweight tour of hyperspace. Most of the book is taken up by fiction, speculation, and digression, which doesn't leave much space for solid information. This book is thinner than some of his others. All in all, ""Surfing Through Hyperspace"" is recommendable if you're a fan of Pickover, you're ok with a simplified introduction to the subject, and you don't mind ""cute"" writing. Otherwise, I'd give it a pass."
4,good reading for the curious,"""Surfing through hyperspace"" is a book for those who are curious but not serious about their scientific knowledge. The book is very readable and quite intriguing (although the x-files references are annoying)providing a comprehensive but not in depth knowledge of higher dimensional workings. It tells about the interesting phenomena that occur in the fourth dimension while providing minimal explanations in hardcore physics. So it's a weekend book for those who are interested but not planning to become theoretical physicists."
1,Disappointment,"I started reading this book and was bored after a couple of pages. I expected the book to be informational, but it seemed to be written for entertainment, and not the kind I like. Maybe I misunderstood something, but the author seemed to imply that there may be gods hiding in the 4th dimension. I wasted 3 bucks on this piece of literature."
5,Very Informative,"This is a great book with lots of info not only about bear attacks, but about their behavior in general. There are different circumstances in a bear attack depending of the type of bear, whether the bear is startled or looking for a meal. This book explains eveything for you, even how to recognize the tracks of the different bears. The author is careful not to make assumptions and speculations, but just to present known facts and conclusions. He won't say that a certain response to a bear attack will or will not always work, but just how it has worked in the past. I would be interested to know about Polar Bear attacks, which is not covered in the book."
1,Disappointed in revised edition.,"Just another of an old book you add a few lines to and call it revised edition. I thought he would go into recent attacks since the first edition. Many of the same stories. Many of the same pictures, illustrations and just the old book with a new cover. Might say a few more lines about pepper spray and a few things but that's it. Don't waste your money on it. Buy the older edition in hardback and save money. You are basically reading the same thing. The book is a great book but not the revised edition. Same as old. Very disappointed."
5,Required Reading For Backcountry Camping in Grizzly Country,"This is an outstanding book to prepare yourself for being in the backcountry with Grizzlies. It offers a great deal of information on both black and grizzly bears. It thoroughly covers everything to do with bears including their biology and life cycle, descriptions of previous attacks, and, of course, what to do when you encounter a bear. This book explains in detail why it is important to act differently towards bears in different situations.Some people have mentioned that the book goes into too great a detail regarding bear attacks. I disagree. I believe that this information is important if you are ever unlucky enough to be attacked by a bear. However, don't read this book while you are actually camping in grizzly territory. A group just before us sustained a bluff charge so we knew a grizzly was nearby. That incident combined with the reading of the book while camping combined for some really restless sleep."
5,Great book,"The best book on bears. Anyone going into bear country has to read this, it's that good!!"
1,didn't fit,Modified lid to fit coffee maker. workes but seemed to advertize as working with coffe maker so a bit disappointed
3,Cusinart 12 cup Coffee Carafe,"When I received this item, the first thing I noticed was that the red plastic was inferior to the original plastic. It seemed like a lighter quality. I was slightly disappointed."
5,Replacement Carafe,Works great as a replacement for my Hamilton Beach coffee maker. Arrived timely and as promised - excellent service! Maybe a little expensive but at least now I can use my coffee maker again.
2,"Wow, major disappointment","Being a sci-fi fan, I knew going into this movie that I was risking my money. At first all was good. Okay story, nice actors, and pretty cool visuals and aliens. Then the story just became more and more stupid with an ending unworthy of a trash heap. Talk about potential wasted."
3,"Crisp effects look great on blu-ray, but that's about it","2.7 starsWeak script, weak acting, weakness in general. But, wonderful special effects, especially the blue light things, and the CGI monsters.Highlight was the insanely annoying screaming woman getting jammed into a monster's giant slavering maw. Now that was true cinematic satisfaction! Too bad she had to be so irritating for five minutes to make it happen. The Brothers Strause clearly want to be the Wachowski Brothers in every way, yet lack the requisite talent and imagination. The monsters here are so much like the probes in The Matrix, they oughta be sued.Skyline is a b-movie with A-1 special effects. If you like eye candy (I do), you'll find plenty of fun here. If you hate bad acting, stay far away. Extra star for a truly hilariously stupid yet satisfyingly non-Hollywood ending. When nobody is ""good"" (or at least can act well), it's nice to see everyone get turned into alien monsters.Warning: spoiler in previous sentence."
3,Blue Lights in the Sky - Close Encounters of the Worst Kind,"There is not a lot to say about this film. It seems like everything in this movie has been done already. ""Been There, Done That"" keeps ringing in my head when I think about this film. There is nothing, absolutely nothing original about this film. It gives you that deja vu feeling, and your mind will drift off to other movies where the particular element was done before.Here are a list of films that this movie reminds me of:- independence day- close encounters- fire in the sky- starship troopersThe cinematics and special effects have been done pretty well, hence the three stars. Apart from that, the acting is that of a 'B' movie.The primary objective of a movie is to provide a unique and entertaining experience, however, if all that can be provided is very good graphics, most of the patrons will leave still feeling unfulfilled. My recommendation, is to pass on this one, unless are a sold-out sci-fi fan."
1,less than awful,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of enduring. The concept is interesting, but the special effects really are the only thing this movie has going for it, which is a real shame. The Asylum, who make the usually pretty dire SyFy Original Motion Pictures, do better than this... six or seven times out of ten. Poor writing, really rather dumb, unlikable characters, and writers/directors who really seemed more interested in making video games than movies make this one one to miss."
3,Skyline,"If you like science fiction (as I do), This isn't a bad movie. Not the best I'v ever seen, though. I don't like the ending at all. Don't really know how to describe this entity. Just failed to hold my interest, even though I watched the whole thing. Thought maybe it would get better and just didn't. Seems to end with a sequel in mind. I probably wouldn't get it."
1,Special Effects vs Plot,"(Beware, this review contain spoilers.) No plot but very well executed special effects. I think most everybody could have developed a plot like this one. It is easy to think of a story about humanity perishing under the attack of interplanetary aliens. Come on, that's really easy. The aliens come, shoot or burn or eat or disintegrate everybody, then end of story. No necessity for developing an ending where somebody saves the day, no matter how improbable. Just mankind disappearing. One of the worst movie ever."
3,Great concept...very poor ending,"Overall, I like this movie and the for the most part I would have rated it 4 stars...but the ending was so bad, I had to down grade it. I suggest you watch it and miss the last 5 min of the movie."
1,revolting,"Great special effects. Everything else was horrendous, not to mention revolting. Oh yeah, and the black guy was the first to go...who'd a thunk it?"
1,Skyline,"SkylineThis movie looked like it was going to be a really good movie and then it just ended, leaving the viewer to try and decide what happened. I don't like things that don't have either an ending or an implied sequel. I seriously doubt that they will have a sequel so it was just a dumb ending. I give all movies a 1 star that DVD manufacturer/producers have started making the consumer buy Blue Ray to view any of the extra features as seems to be popular with DVD movie makers today. Worse, they have a menu and sub-menus of extras. Each one taking you to a message that says you have to purchase Blue Ray to view. What? You weren't making enough millions on DVDs? I will NEVER purchase a Blue Ray system. DVD is just fine with me. I can't afford, nor will I let any producer shove formats down my throat. How possitively rude. By putting the extras 'tease' menus on the DVD that lead to no where but your pocket book, you guarantee me not buying your product. Boycot these fiends!"
1,More like SkyLAME,Donald Donald Donald.....didn't Bill Lawrence teach you that you are supposed to READ your scripts BEFORE you sign on to do a film?
1,Not worth the cellophane wrapping.,There is nothing that justifies dreck like this. Not one single thing to redeam itself. Too bad you can't actually get money back. Thinking of sending it to the pubisher so they can take responsibility for filling the landfill.
1,An utter waste of money,"I'll keep this brief. If I could give Skyline minus 5 stars I would. This was an absolute utter waste of money. I can sit through an alien movie with bad acting, but this had atrocious acting. It was down right off the scale bad. Aliens journey millions of light years to steal human brains? Seriously?!?! I'm glad I didn't waste the money on the Blu-Ray disk. If you're looking for a good alien sci-fi action movie, check out Battle: Los Angeles instead. Peace."
1,Almost the worst sci-fi movie ever,"Absolutely terrible. I loved Battle L.A. and District 9 for the record.This was almost as bad as that John Travolta ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""The Mist"" with the most depressing ending ever(which I believe came from the same director?!I dont even want to review this, and why I hated it ,because it will require me to think about it again. Go see Battle L.A for the same but done much, much better. Go see Avatar, or Aliens, for great Sci-fi."
1,"No Story, one basic plot. Boring as Hell","I watched this movie with no anticipation of it being good or bad, but went into it with an open mind. All I can say is I want my hour and a half back to spend else where. This is the plot/story. Aliens Invade, Human Die. The End. Its a constant bored. At one point I really thought it would get better, the last half hour would be awesome. I was wrong, it was worst than the beginning of the movie, it just kept getting more retarded by the minute. The CGI work was good, the acting was horrid along with everything else but the CGI. Don't waste you money on buying, or renting. Wait for it to hit cable tv, by that I mean the weekend night movie on TBS, or Fox, USA, Etc."
4,Very good sci-fi,"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. I guess you either love this or hate it. And I loved it. The one thing I will say is that the ending left me hanging. I had the feeling that I had just watched part 1 of a 2 part film. Other than that, this is one of the best alien invasion films ever."
1,The worst movie ever,"My title says it all. I can't believe I actually paid for this movie. No plot, no substance, and probably the worst ending of any movie I have ever seen."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"Unbelievably bad pointless, tasteless garbage. I'm so sorry I didn't know in advance that I would be wasting an hour and a half of my life on one of the worst films I have ever seen. If you like nihilism and dreck, this film's for you. NO redeeming features whatsoever."
1,Stupid,"Great special effects and creative aliens do not make up for a boring plot, bad acting, and a stupid ending."
4,Surprised,This movie had great affects and was action packed. The thought behind this at first made me think really? but as the movie played on it turned out to be a good movie.
4,I don't understand why people hate this movie,"I thought it was pretty cool. The action is pretty awesome and the concept was pretty interesting. I'm pretty picky when it comes to movies like this. The mixed reviews made me not want to buy this movie, but I'm glad I did. If you like Cloverfield, you'll definitely like this movie."
4,Not for people that expect a happy ending all the time,"People that can't appreciate an honest opinion of an alien invasion like this movie portrays seem to be the type that has to have everything wrapped up nicely with a bow on top of it. They are unable to see truth in anything and prefer to get the ""Safe version"" where it all turns out ok in the end. Well, sorry to inform them that life doesn't always turn out ok for everybody. This movie shows a small story of what is a huge invasion, it's not the entire story at all. If something like what this movie portrays really happened, the outcome would not be a good one. I'm confident enough in my opinion to believe that the lower the IQ, the more unhappy the individual will be with this movie. Specifically because they just can't understand it and need that reassuring message of hope that this movie does not give the viewer. Don't watch this movie if you're IQ is less than 100, you won't like it or understand it."
3,horrible ending,"It had me interested enough to watch it without any breaks. I won't give it away, but the ending was not so great. I thought that the movie was going to continue until my screen went blank & that was it. I felt there should have been more to the ending then a blank screen."
4,"Really good, Don't listen to these fools",This was a really good sci-fi movie & looks fantastic for a $10 million dollar budgetNo its not a james camron $2 billion dollar for all those spoiled..but its a good flick so watch it
1,don't even...,"easily the worst movie i have ever seen. barely any plot, barely any point, could have been so much better. huge dissapointment"
1,This movie deserved negative stars,"Forgot that I will never get the 3.99 I spent on this movie back.Forget that I will never get the one hour and forty minutes back.What I can't believe is that not only did someone think up this putrid debacle, but that a major Hollywood production company bankrolled, and made it. The plot was grotesque, the acting was even worse, and the storyline as a whole was non existent.Total letdown with no probative value whatsoever, special effects where meh, and the creatures themselves were so appallingly unbelievable that it was painful to watch. Whoever thought up this movie should never be given creative license over anything more important than a lost pet flier."
1,huge waste of 2 hours,"This movie starts out like a cliche ""party in Miami"" movie and doesn't really get much better. The actors were ok at acting, but the story just dragged. They pretty much sat in an apartment the entire time while aliens destroyed everybody and everything. Their efforts to escape were lame, and they didn't really try very hard. The ending was when the movie finally got interesting and grabbed my attention, but then the credits rolled and I was left wondering why I spent $10 to see it. It seemed open for a sequel, but they really should have gotten to what happened at the end much quicker and continued the movie from there. They would have had a much more interesting movie. I would recommend not buying this movie, definitely not at full price. Borrow it from netflix if you must see it, then make your purchase decision. I wish I could get my $10 back for seeing it in the theater, it was so not worth it."
1,Slightly Better than Getting Poked with a Sharp Stick,"That's being too kind really...I don't know what it was about Skyline that makes me hate it so much; it had a reasonable cast, great special effects, okay dialogue, and fairly original aliens. Sounds good right? It wasn't... Save your time for something fulfilling... Maybe counting sand or watching paint dry...I swear, Skyline starts with an interesting beginning, and a couple of minutes in immediately does everything it can to make you hate all the main characters and wish for their deaths. On that count, you will not be disappointed, pretty much everyone dies, but not in some redeeming or cathartic manner.Bleh..."
1,Don't waste your money!,This movie was so bad an with so many great actors I feel bad. To me it is a very bad re make of Independence day (Kinda like that movie) The ending was not good at all
1,One of those B-Grade Sci-Fi; Don't waste your time and money,"It's a B grade Sci-Fi movie with lower than average acting. Worst is, it doesn't have either a proper beginning or a logical/palatable ending. Go for it only if you want to waste your time and/or money. It isn't worth of spending more time writing a review for it than what I wrote above."
1,"they had me, but then lost me...","Some good actors, good concepts, good effects, but it felt like they started filming before they knew where they were going with this movie. I really wanted to like this movie...but as it moves on it feels like its missing something. The ending was just odd...not in a good way either. Skip this movie, or redbox it, or stream it for free....If you pay 25 bucks for it you will be pissed. Expect it to be in the 5 dollar bargin bin fast!"
1,Skip this one,"The movie starts with bright blue lights slowly falling from the sky, followed by bigger spaceships. When any person looks into the light, gets pulled into one of the spaceships. Why? Maybe perhaps the aliens want to use the humans as a power source to power the blue LED lights? We don't know until the very end.There are way too many holes in this film. When a nuclear bomb is detonated on one of the spaceships, it does not vaporize. It gets damaged, but somehow it proceeds to repair itself back to the original shape and form.Throughout the movie, they are trying to make it to the boat, because the aliens can not function over the water. What would prevent them? They seem to have advanced technology.Some of the special effects are cheezy, dialog terrible. Expect surprise ending!If you are a hardcore sci-fi fan, maybe you will like this movie. Otherwise I would skip this one and watch something else."
2,"Better than ""The Happening"" b/c it had aliens","Aliens were creative & done well. Actors, plot & thought processes weren't. I always feel some people bring too much logic to alien movies but Jeezuschristalmighty! One gesture between a couple, a la ""ditto"" from ""Ghost"", can't possibly tie together this many loose ends! The only movie I've been more upset with was ""The Happening"". C'mon, trees? TREES??!!Also, I know this has little to do with anything except common sense, but this blu-ray costs more than True Grit...just sayin'"
1,Aliens Coming for that Organ You Use the Least,"Pre-title credits, the movie begins with an attention-grabbing opener of the main character under control of an alien force outside a window, then it goes downhill from here. A group of irritating, partying stoner-types, whose lives you will never care about because the writers obviously didn't, are followed during an alien invasion. I've enjoyed Eric Balfour in Haven and other appearances, but this movie was not his friend. The character was shallow, more-so than the usual action-movie characters, and there didn't seem to be any coherent story line at all. I was angry at myself for having stuck through this movie to the end.Spoiler Alert:I'll never get those 94 minutes back, which is a more insidious brain theft than that of the aliens."
2,meh,"Our species has traveled through the void to collect the Universe's most precious resource...human brains... It was lucky that they were compatible!The movies is fun for a little, but not worth much overall. Mediocre action, bad dialogue and a stupid plot."
2,"idk wasn't to good, but maybe worth a try for you","not really that good, dont recommend , some cool effects and ideas but plot kinda sucks thought could go so many other ways. to make it so much better but sadly did not"
3,Seems like half a movie,"This movie ended too soon and without enough happening. There are movies that have sequels that end and leave you with a sense of gotten enough of a movie to feel satisfied and eager in anticipation for the next part. In my opinion, this movie needed a more complete plot; so far, all we have is ""powerful aliens attack stranded humans. credits roll."" Yes, I'd like to know what happens next (good), but I am left feeling like I've only seen half of a full movie (aww). Maybe had it been this + the sequel combined, I'd say 4 stars.BTW, I rented this for only a buck. Didn't buy it. Didn't pay movie theater price."
1,Not worth your time,The movie was so bad that had I spent more than $1 to see it I would have left...one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. Don't waste your time!
1,ughth YUCK!!!!,"Anyone who gives this movie a good review must have been high or something. Apparently graphics are more important than anything. This movie makes me think of thoughs Hot Women you see in night clubs all looks and no morals, personality or soul. This movie should have been on the scifi channel like all lame low budget alien films."
2,Great Effects - Shame It Can't Fix The Lack of Story,"The short and sweet of it......the effects and CGI were awesome, but the complete utter lack of anything I'd call a story leads to a one lousy movie. Save your money and don't spend more than a $1 at your local RedBox or Netflix."
3,really bad... but then...,"...I already heard it was that bad. However, I did watch the whooooole thing, and, well, I have to admit I enjoyed it (to a certain extent) with the realization that this was a really bad 'B' sci-fi movie. The acting was 'eye rolling' terrible, the effects were just below 'meh' (a total rip-off of Independance Day), the screen play a complete 'yawn', and the ending was laughable in the extreme. So, if you have ninety mintues to kill on a rainy afternoon (when this reaches the Neflix 'free instant' bin): go ahead. But be forwarned... this is a REALLY bad movie. Then, like me, you can roll your eyes, grimace at the acting, yawn at the plot, and laugh out loud at the end... you might enjoy it. ('might)."
4,What a Ride,Lots of action and if you paid attention you could definitely understand what was happening. Actually very sad and final in a way. Would loved to have had the ending go further.
2,...but the special effects were great,"How often have you heard that? Well, in this case it's true. The characters were totally unlikeable -- and not in a funny way. I kept thinking, ""If these are the last people on Earth, humanity is doomed."" And the story. Well, not unlike Cloverfield, we don't really know what's going on throughout the movie, except that there are some bad guys from outerspace messing up one of our big cities. And, OMG, the ending. Don't even get me started. What a crappy ending...but the special effects were great."
2,Skyline DVD,"I saw the trailer and was excited. The special effects were first rate . . . . everything else . . . not so much. To me, the movie broke solidly down the middle. The men actors I found lacking, while the women actors were pretty good (especially Scottie Thompson). I don't think an all star academy award winning cast would have saved this stinker. I watched, hoping it would get better but it didn't. The alien invasion was more believable than the characters and dialog.Wish I could have liked it."
1,Aliens Turned Zombie....BRAINS!!!!!,"This movie is an absolute joke....It starts out GREAT and after the first 40 mins it begins to BOMB FAST, It is worth a watch for a good laugh but do not get this film expecting a great story, there really is not one nor is there any sort of plot..... I would love to say some of the parts in the film but I do not want to give it away for those who are willing to spend money on this......all I can say is WOW what a CRAPPY ENDING!!!"
4,B picture but not boring,"This film kept my attention for an hour and a half which is why I gave it four stars. It's a remake of '50s aliens conquer the world sci-fi movies, which means you aren't going to get fine acting, script, or scientific credibility. As a kid I loved those films and this is an updated version of those works. If you can't stand getting your intelligence dissed a little than this film is not for you. But if you have a soft spot for monsters eat the world movies, then it's a good film in that narrow genre. One warning, it's much more grim and hopeless than Independence Day, and it has no where near the cast of the recent War of the Worlds. Good movie for people like me who in some ways never grow up."
1,A terrible movie,Just wanted to warn people thinking of buying this movie. It is just awful and you are better off saving your money for something else.
1,"B Movie, No plot, worst scifi film I've seen in a LONG time.","This was so horrible I was without words. Script, dialogue, acting were the lowest level you'll see in a Hollywood movie, you'll cring a lot, and the first 20 minutes are very hard to sit through without giving up on the film. Seriously its B-movie and even video games have better acting, plots and scripts than this, and so do Sci-Fi channel's movies are more entertaining. I'm not exagerating either, or a big movie ""buff"", this was plain awful. Theres no appeal to this, the aliens have no character or purpose, the scenes are unoriginal, characters non existant, boring. The fact that there is anybody who could give this 5 stars is amazing. Theres nothing interesting, nothing original except some nice 3D graphics (which are standard for movies anyways).WATCHING this movie is a bad idea, let alone BUYING it..."
2,That ending...,"A film about an alien invasion of the earth where the point seems to be harvesting human beings for some purpose. Set in Los Angeles, we follow a group of characters living their lives when the aliens invade with their motherships and eerie blue light that does strange things to people. We watch our heroes hiding and then trying to escape the invasion but to no avail: everyone dies or is captured. The air of the movie is bleak, the special effects are great, the whole movie has an air of hopelessness (on mankind's part) and is quite disturbing but then comes the ending of the film with our two remaining heroes (one of whom is pregnant) captured by an alien mothership and the aliens harvesting human brains... a bizarre ending to what up until that point was a not too bad film. I would have said avoid this film but apparently there's going to be a Skyline 2... maybe this will repair some of the damage of that God-awful ending?"
2,dissapointed,This movie left me hanging-- although graphics were good the storyline was terrible--just when the movie was getting good-it was over-
3,Underwhelmed,"I can sum my impression of this movie in one made up word......Meh. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. I am a huge lover of alien movies so I am bound to find something desirable about it. But that's as far as it goes. Nothing special here."
2,it was okay,"this movie was okay. if you have high expectations, you'll be sorely disappointed. but why you watching this movie if you have high expectations anyway? if you want to be mindlessly entertained for a little more than an hour, check it out."
3,Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!,"Okay, this is a strictly visual movie. Consider this suitable warning: Don't worry about the acting, editing, or plot.If you're a fan of Lovecraft Mythos horror, you'll absolutely see virtue in this extravaganza of alien planetary assault. They have attacked, don't care one bit for humanity except as a resource, and are seeking something quite specific that their advanced nano-technology apparently has some difficulty manufacturing. That's the only reason they've arrived, and it's nasty.None of the characters inspire particular affection, but that is just as well and doesn't detract from the fun. It's Los Angeles, after all.If you enjoy science fiction and don't mind watching a movie where the aliens win, this is an amusing diversion from daily existence."
1,Waste of digital film and money.,"Bad acting, plot sucks, no drama, no nothing. I would buy the rights to this piece of crap and burn the original copy."
1,Dont bother,"worst movie ever, when he changed into the alien in the end I couldnt believe I wasted 4 bucks on this."
2,yuck!!!,"This movies started off gtreat. Then the e3nd. The ending ruined the whole movie. It was almost like they got tired of wrikting and just wanted to end it. The end was cheap and poorly nwriten. It made no sense and would be equal to one of those old ""B"" movies. Daarn it that was unfair to the ""B"" movies because those movies had some thought. bPlease don't buy it is a waist of money. Wait till it's free."
1,only chose one star 'cause it won't let me rate it NO stars,"Pro: Very well done sfxCon: it's like they WANT you to dislike all the characters. there was no point, acting was not good, the aliens are here for our BRAINS!! when it's over you just feel like 'why did i bother?""Battle: L.A. is everything this movie is not, go see that, then go hug a MARINE"
2,HELL NO THIS MOVIE SUCKS,THE ONLY REASON I GIVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS IS THE FIRST 45 MINUTES ARE WELL DONE BUT THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST OF ALL TIME IN MOTION PICTURES HISTORY
1,Talk you to death,"Please end or start, I want my life back more so my forty dollars. Not worth rental cost from red box,The life of your dvd player and the electric to have the tv on,The rubber off your tires to go see it, The postage to buy it by mail, and The bag of bag of popcorn. Other than that it was ok."
1,Missable,"Let's start with the good parts of this movie: the invasion of space monsters has some great effects, including evil electro-squid that don't quite reach the level of 'hackneyed'. And who doesn't think that LA could use a certain amount of devastation?That's about it. The body-countdown, where the little band grows littler one horror at a time, hardly counts as a plot. And the reason for the alien invasion? Well, a viewer's suspension of disbelief requires a little help from the movie-makers, but we as viewers never get the help we need. If you can blot out all attempts to understand the action in any rational way, you might enjoy the mayhem and the effects. I need a bit more, even in an action/effects flick. The worst thing, though, might be that hint of sequel-bait suggesting that there might be another on the way- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
1,Worse Alien Film In History...........,"It starts of pretty well, and the effects are great, but it just gets more stupid the further along you happen to watch. It's so bad, you actually start to root for the aliens to finish the characters off, and end the movie that much quicker....LOL.......Don't waste your money on this crap....IMO."
1,Not bad for a script written in 30 minutes....,"Usually when I rent a movie my expectations are very low because of the minimal investment. I must say my expectations weren't set low enough. This has to be one of the worst scifi movies ever made, and I am trying to be polite. I gave it one star because of the decent special effects. Otherwise it would have been zero stars. I was not looking for academy award acting but something better than one line statements to be followed-up by a worse plot. The end of the movie will leaving you saying ""Are you freaking kidding me?"" That is what everyone said who watched the movie with me. I realize everyone is entitled to their opinion and I can respect it. However, those of you who gave this four and five stars must have watched a different movie."
1,skip this one,"This movie is just plain bad, the acting, special effects, story (or lack thereof), everything about it. I love the sci-fi genre, but this one was not enjoyable in any way."
2,"""Battle: Los Angeles"" had more explosions","Friendly advice from one sci-fi nerd to another: this is not the show you're looking for. Move along, move along. ""Skyline"" is an amalgam of plagiarized tidbits from similar movies, sprinkled with boring dialogue. The main characters are sleazebags, and it's not clear why they're included. It's hard to identify with anyone. Some SFX mistakes are noticeable, and some juicy potential shots are missed. The plot is hollow and predictable up to the very last scene, which delivers an ""Oh, BROTHER"" moment. The ending is a slap-in-the-face fizzle. Trying to understand this movie, I think the writers visualised the modern equivalent of a 1950s serial or ""B"" movie, but the charm or campiness is missing. Hope this helps."
1,Unoriginal and kind of boring.....,"This movie is about as unoriginal as they come. Produced by people with enough money to afford good SFXs but with no creativity. The space ships (another reviewer describes them as ""giant vacuum cleaners from space"") are copies from other movies, the alien creatures are uninspired copies from all the good 'alien' movies from the past and the plot is totally predictable. This movie is a combination of Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and various 'Alien' films that we have already seen. This film was a tremendous waste of money to make. What studio would have paid for this? It's not worth buying. See the other films instead."
4,Pretty good Sci-Fi,"Skyline is a victim of a poor title to start with. Yes, it's yet another alien invasion. The cast has no big names and we have probably seen most of them somewhere, but there is nothing wrong with the acting. Other than that, there is a solid story line and plot. There is just enough use of special effects to move the action along and what is seen is very well done. I like productions like this that set up the frame for the story and then get it done without a lot of thrashing around with side plots. This story is laser focused on the aliens and what happens to the people without getting lost in excessive character development. Unfortunately, the story is not very original until the very end. Part of the plot is a hyper-active clone of the 1998 British TV mini-series Invasion:Earth that somehow starred Fred Ward. Watch the credit roll at the end very carefully for a setup to a very weird sequel."
4,Skyline review,"I rented this movie on-line and my computer gave me problems. So I ordered it and watched it with my family. Eric Balfour is not a major star, but he held his own in this movie. There were a lot of familiar faces and the action started from frame one, which I loved! It was a great movie, my son said he was going to get it and watch it again. It's a movie that I would watch two or three times. Usually after seeing a movie once, I'm tired of it and I seldom collect and keep them. I will keep this one. Sci-fi fans will love it."
3,Not bad at all,So I heard the movie was bad so I went into it thinking the worst and expecting to get some laughs. I got some laughs and was pretty happy with it. Good action at times. Good suspense at times. It's the opposite of Independents Day. There's no fighting back. Just try to survive. The CG was good. Ending was about the lamest part.
1,Waste of time and Money,One of the worst films of the year.Plot was predictable (if you could call it that)Barely any dialogue.Film was pretty much special effects only.Aliens invade earth.Aliens turn humans into cyborg monsters.Flat and predictable.
3,The last 15 mins...Made me want to jump from a SKYLINE,Bad CAST - OK movie - thanks to the effects - the last 15 mins. just got retarded..I mean really?? I read in one review about the guy that worked in the building looked like he wanted to rape the blonde girl the first chance he got....I felt the same way..bad casting - Watched it on Vudu so glad I didn't buy it. For sure a one time watch...I few good moments but really BAD CASTING BAD ACTING - Skyline would have been a good short movie..like 15 mins.
1,WORST FILM OF 2010,"Prepare yourself. One of the WORST movies of all time. Universal should be paying people to suffer through this, instead of the other way around."
1,Skyline Review !!!SPOILER WARNING!!!,"I seen the trailer for this movie, looked REALLY goodi saw the movie in theaters, it was HORRIBLE!This movie was God awful horrible! there is virtually NO PLOT to this and the only good part of the movie was at the very ending when the real action started to kick up but just cuts off to the ending credit.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!"
3,It's a cool little action flick.,"It wasn't that bad! Geeeez! Did you really go to the theater expecting to see an oscar winning alien invasion movie? I knew it was going to be super-campy going in but I was pleasently surprised to find that it was only slightly campy. In fact I thought it was a more realistic invasion than any invasion flick I've seen in a long time.The only thing that I had a problem with was the hotel worker/owner/whatever. That dude was trippin. I was hoping he would get killed off quick. Or mabey die a really gruesome death. Sound cruel? Wait until you see that guy.The ending was perfect! By that I mean the way the aliens' technology works and the way they ran their military campaign. Im glad it didn't end in the typical American way with the ""good guys"" comming out on top with little or no damage to themselves. It was brutal and unforgiving and that's the way I like it."
1,Aliens... again?,Ok lets start out with the good things 1.graphicsIm a guy who doesnt care for graphics so the movie was exaggerated i laughed at it because it was sooooooooooo bad. ok so these aliens come and basically kill like 99 percent of LA and in the end... i must warn you if you wanna see this movie dont read on... ok back to the point in the end the 1 girl is basically the only survivor and judging by the way its going she is going to die also but as i said before the graphics are really good this one the second worst movie besides kung foo panda ok so ive said every thing except... DONT SEE IT
2,it's true...,"It's true, this movie is indeed really bad:* poor acting* poor storyline* poor directing* poor writing/dialog* poor ending* poor logic (some how they were able to watch the jet fights in close ups on TV, who is shooting it?)* poor use of law-of-physics (except the alien force)* poor use of RED camera (not film like, more like a reality tv show)Special effects were good but overall - piss poor."
2,Waste of Time,"I wish I could have the 90 minutes back that I wasted watching this film. I won't go into detail about what the film was about, a lot of other reviews have already explained it thoroughly. I just felt I had to put my 2 cents in here. I'm not sci-fi fan anymore, but I used to be a diehard sci-fi fan. This is one of the worst films I've seen. No plot, very weak story line. The best part was the closing credits. I give it 2 stars because I think the actors did a good job with what they had to work with. Don't waste your time."
1,Terrible movie.,"Cheezy special effects, ridiculous plot, bad acting - this movie has it all. If you only remember one thing let it be this - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE!"
1,BUYER BEWARE...,"OK.. not really going to comment on the quality of the movie as its really a matter of taste.. but i am going to comment on the bluray itself : Listed here is the Universal Studio edition of the disc, aka the USA version.. what you end up receiving is the canadian edition which is released by Alliance... Not impressed when i opened my parcel to find this out.. Different artwork (spoiled by french translations).. GRRR.. sorry, but i expect to get what i paid for and not an alternative especially when i wasn't even notified prior. Shame. :("
1,worst movie ever!,"and that is some statement, but it really is the most dire movie in movie history. No pace, no script, no direction, no story, no plot, no acting.........i actually pressed the speed forward button after 60 minutes as i couldnt take anymore but i thought id see what the conclusion was............and that was laughable!......how on earth do people get away with being able to make such a bad movie!.....hollywood is going from bad to worse. Please avoid this movie like the plague!!!!!!!!...you have been warned"
1,skyline disappointment,Skyline Review..I was not happy with the movie which was produced by the same people who produce many of the SyFy channel shows. The movie could have been shot in a one bedroom apartment. It certainly did not compare with Falling Skies or even Battle:Los Angeles.
2,Good CGI but Dismal Plot,"I watched this movie cold having no idea how it would end; the problem I found was it didn't end, just stopped. The computer effects were very well done so there's really no complaint from that department; the storyline was the familiar alien invasion by a technologically superior force.Most of the component elements of the story were pretty much of an ""off-the-shelf"" variety so there were few, if any surprises. The genre of this movie is a blend of sci-fi and horror with the horror part taking the lead most of the movie. Did I mention that there is no ending, the movie just picks a point and stops on a very downer note. I've seen other movies and books that did this and I must confess this approach is rather annoying to me.This is definitely one you want to watch before buying; some of the reviewers liked it but it's a very polarizing movie in my opinion."
1,A movie not worth it...,I watched this movie and this is what I think of the movie.The Acting in this movie was not even B grade and using the word Dude over and over and over realy was frustrating to watch. It was like with the Acting and script they attempted to go cirtian directions but ended up confusing me as to what this movie was all about.The special effects were Awesome. The plot line had potentional but I think they tryed to go sevral directions and failed to reach these directions and ended up with a hurry up and get it done movie.The ending or the last 10 mins of the movie were the best part for me. I did like the ending I think they were attempting to leave room for another movie but I am not sure.Over all I was disapointed with the movie and will stick to that.I know there are a few who enjoyed the movie and prolly seen things I did not but thats up to each of us and in my case I would recomend Avoiding this movie B/c this is a movie not worth it.....
4,A competent yet much maligned movie,"I have seen this movie beat down by negative reviews ever since it came out. Well, i'm here to tell you that the movie is not nearly as bad as you have heard. It doesn't earn the 4 stars I gave up, more like 3.5 stars. I don't know if I give it that high because I expected so little and was pleasantly surprised by what I got, or because it actually deserves to be that high. Bottom line, the movie held my interest and the acting was solid. I was entertained, and really, isn't that why we watch movies?"
1,Half Baked,"I was extremely disappointed by this film. I had very high expectations going into the show. However, I found it to be a half baked story line filled with poor acting, very long and drawn out 'ramp up', and it seemed the author had no idea how to end the movie. So, the story line and film was just ended. I am sure someone had some whacked out deeper meaning thing in mind that we're all supposed to get - some type of geopolitical statement about our present world and 'stolen resources', or something like that, which only the creative director of this film understands. I recommend staying away from this one - unless you like a good joke without the punch line."
1,Not worth a rental,I've always liked these types of movies but this is the WORST movie of this type I've seen. The movie should make me want to see the heroes attack and vanquish the big bad aliens. However I found the characters so unlikable that I was pulling for the aliens. They couldn't kill them fast enough to get them off the screen. It takes either real skill or complete incompetence to craft a movie with not one character with any redeeming qualities.
1,Horrible Movie,I'm glad I rented this movie before attempting to buy it. The acting/ characters sucks more than anything I have ever seen in any Sci-Fi movie. The special effects are the best part but the plot is awful. No comparison to Independence Day or Battle L.A. I totally agree with several other negative reviewers here. Don't even rent this garbage. You've been warned. P.S.- I saw Battle LA in theater the opening weekend and I thought it was a better movie than Independence Day. Plenty of action and awesome special effects from start to finish.
1,"Hey, I watched it for the haven dude... why did you?","what ever..No really.. thats my review. It is as complete as the movie was.Sigh, nope, I can't do it.. Special effects, sweeet. Afore mentioned haven dude, rarely out of a wife beater, heh..also nice. Sorry, thats the best I can do, and really in my opinion, the best they did. Previous viewers mentioned the whole, we rang.. ooops. Sorry, that did not work for me either.. Aliens were a bit too ""meaty"" for me to believe they were the new world, pfft. Wait for this one to be the free home view on netflix, not worth the rental bucks... sorry haven dude."
2,It was just...weird.,"The movie starts out as a good thriller movie. Then it stalls. Finally you realize there are only 15 min left and wonder where they plan on going with the film. By the end, I was thinking, ""That was it? Give me back the hour and a half of my life!"" Seriously, the preview is as good as it gets."
2,SOMEWHERE WITHIN THERE'S A BETTER STORY,Somewhere within there's a better story but it's in need of some revising. Tale focuses on some shallow LA types who are living it up when the city is attacked by a swarm of aliens. Think INDEPENDENCE DAY gone horribly wrong. There's some nice special effects here and there and moments when the story gets interesting but in lots of other parts it feels like they ran out of money or the people creating it got tired and decided to end the pain fast.The ending was somewhat lame. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C to C plus; STORY/PLOTTING: C; CGI: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: today (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: C plus.
4,Wesley Willis will eat your soul,"This music is not for the close minded. It's outsider, that's without question, but there is something to it. I can't stop listening. Anybody looking for something different, this is it."
1,holds up for a single listen,"I have a sense of humor, but Wesley Willis is an extremely overrated novelty act. His lack of skill and squealy vocals are pretty amusing the first time through, but the songs are identical, right down to the predictable choruses, which drastically cuts down on replay value. Borrow it from a friend but don't shell out money for this."
1,has the world gone mad?,"when i read these reviews proclaiming wesley willis as a genius i have serious doubts about the human race. The music is only listenable because it is so bad it is funny. It is quite possibly the worst music i have ever heard in my lifetime. it is highly amusing to listen to, strictly because it is so terrible, but for those of you who take it seriously, i am very very afraid. as much fun as that little casio keyboard is that we all got for christmas when we were 8, it makes for horrible music. Every chorus to the songs are identical, and the words are terrible. In summary there are no redeeming values to this music."
1,A dictonary would've been better,"I bought this book specifically for a trip to Spain based on the reviews and it did not come in handy at all! My Spanish is very basic and I still knew more than what this book contained. There were a variety of phrases (of which only a handful looked useful) but they were grouped in categories that made it weird to find quickly. The size of the book makes it very convenient for travel, but I could not find a lot of common nouns and verbs I needed to order or ask questions so it just became extra weight to carry around. If you know at least elementary spanish, I recommend to skip this book and just get a small dictionary. It will come in much more useful and be cheaper than this book."
2,Innovative but Flawed,"I purchased the Lasermax Unimax laser for my Beretta PX4 Storm in 9mm. After taking it to the range, I found that after only a couple shot the laser would switch off due to the recoil of the gun. The side to side switch wasn't stiff enough to withstand the recoil of the pistol. Also, dry firing at home would cause the laser to dim sometimes, only to brighten back up after a few more dry fires. I've sent it back into to Lasermax twice now and still have the same issues.The pulsing dot and the ability to mount more rail acessories under the laser are very innovative, and I think it'd be a fine product, but I'm afraid it has some design flaw that makes it inherently unreliable. This is completely unacceptable for a laser that retails for upwards of 180 dollars. I would steer clear of it and go for a cheaper, more reliable model."
5,Awesome laser sight!,"I have tried a few different sights on my HK P2000 and Glock 22, this one is the best! The switch is easy to use on four different guns I have tried it on. It works on the front rail of an AR, but a pistol is easier to use it on. It's small size even allows you to use an Uncle Mike's or similar non-Kydex holster with no trouble at all. It holds zero beter that any laser sight I have ever used!"
3,Great performance if you can hear it,"I have no problems with the musical performance, and was thrilled to be able to hear something performed by such a master. Although there is a disclaimer, as mentioned, I have to agree that the recording quality is awful. The popping and hissing is so bad in places that it is nearly impossible to hear the performance. I have since purchased other recordings so that I can hear the music without interruption. If you want this recording to be able to hear how Horowitz performs these pieces, I would recommend this CD. If you want this to be your only recording of these pieces, get another CD."
1,Horrendous Disappointment,"This recording includes a disclaimer [...] Although the manufacturer claims to have expended considerable technical effort in resurrecting this performance, the results are horrid. There are loud pops, whizzes, cracks, and snaps. At times, the pitch wavers monumentally. Horowitz is not even at his best in the Tschaikowsky--if you want to hear that, you need the Bruno Walter recording. Purchase this recording at your own risk--and then only if you are a die-hard Horowitz fanatic willing to suffer greatly for your devotion."
1,boring and more boring,"Yes, I bought this flick to see this ex-Bond chick Carole and, yes, she still looks good but her Greek charm was lost somewhere on a road to England where she married another ex-Bond character but another ex-Bond character want her too. Gee, life is so complicated when you have to chose bettween this and that.Hm, impression is the producer have to make living and these characters too so put them together, let them move and movie cooked to be consumed.Sure, England has other problems, real problems, but why bother when three celebrities move and movie cooked, right?"
5,Business Affair,I am very pleased with my purchase. The product arrived in the condition described by the seller within a reasonable time frame. Thank you.
3,good,i buyed the last version of Antonio Banderas eau de toilette but this version is not the same...shipping is fast and excellent price
4,these are nice but*,"These are nice but they cant go inthe microwave, or dishwasher !! thats a big bummer. but good for dishes if u have to take cold stuff or for leftovers"
3,"Adorable, However...","These bowls are just so attractive and really add to the beauty of my pink kitchen, but WHY NO DISHWASHER OR MICROWAVE USE? They're a great size, the lids fit snugly, beautiful porcelain-like finish, but what a chore to have to transfer hot food to another bowl for reheating, or to have to hand-wash each after a long dinner party! Wish I would have paid attention to that detail before ordering. I guess these are meant more for storage as opposed to heat n' serve. I noticed Kitchen-Aid makes similar ones that are dishwasher safe, had I known I probably would have purchased those instead. All the same, they're still super pretty, durable, and well-made."
4,Lots of ideas,"My 7 year old daughter was so excited when she opened up this book. We saved it until the day after Christmas because we thought she might be getting something similar from someone else-- but she didn't. I had taken her with me to go pick out floss and she didn't know why so when she opened that she was a little confused. I used to make a lot of friendship bracelets when I was a kid so I knew I could help her and it looks like this book is best used if there is someone around to show the basics of friendship bracelet making. Overall, it's a good book to learn how to do different designs and I am so happy that it doesn't come with the lame 'maker wheel' that some of the others come with."
3,I recommend the Cambridge Edition,"I just finished reading and comparing the introduction of this version of the text with the version published by Cambridge University Press. In the latter edition, I found the introduction to be less in the way of circumlocution, yet exceedingly lucid and pithy. Dr. Korsgaard is a pre-eminent scholar in Kantian Ethics, and her introduction alone is what renders the Cambridge edition worthy. The Oxford introduction, while insightful and generally helpful for the layperson, all to often digressed into different interpretations, none of which were too heavily detailed in their illustration. The Cambridge version is concise, as it contains all the information that is needed. It provided a clear map as to how different parts of Kant's conception connected , and thus engendered a synchronic understanding of the overall text."
2,Not a translation for a layperson,"Professor Wood has produced (so he claims -I don't know German) an extremely literal (faithful) translation of the original. His intent in doing do is ""to place the English reader, as far as possible, in the same interpretive position as the German reader of the original."" Whatever you think of that philosophy, it results in an extremely difficult text that is of little use to the uninitiated, even for a motivated layperson like myself.The accompanying essays were interesting, but ultimately not why I bought the book."
2,Never even took it out of the bag!,The shirt was advertised as having 1/4 inch pleats. The shirt that arrived had 1/8 inch pleats. I can't tell you anything about the quality of the shirt because I didn't even take it out of the plastic bag. I returned it the same day.
3,Expected a little bit better for the price...,"It did the job, but I honestly expected better. First, I'm a big Brooks Brothers fan - their shirts are a little more mone (not all that much more), but not by that much more. I was hoping for equivalent quality. First, the cloth is decent cotton, but not the finest. Not close to a brooks brothers or other similar national brand of shirt. Second, and to me the bigger disappointment, was the fact that the shirt has built in collar stays - and if you've worn shirts with built in stays, you know they don't have quite the same collar quality and stiffness as one with normal collar stays.Nonetheless, received complements all night - so paired with the tux and everything else, it did the trick. Just wish it was a little higher quality for the price."
4,Classy Comfort,"I'm a musician so I have to bring out the tux a lot. I really like this shirt because it's comfortable and looks nice. I would prefer that it have the wing tip collar, but this is still a great shirt. And it is a true tuxedo shirt because it has the French cuffs. I was able to use the studs and cuff links I already had with this shirt perfectly."
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the shirt with FRENCH CUFFS, but instead, received regular cuffs with the cheesy cuff-link button holes next to the button on each side. Very disappointed because I needed the shirt by Monday 1/14. Please look at the product offered and tell me if these are French Cuffs!"
3,Not the best quality but works,"Built-in collar stays...that's all I have to say. All night my wife kept saying ""something is wrong with that collar"". LOL!"
4,Decent Cotton Shirt - Fits Snug,"Decent shirt. Just fit me, but it would be too small if I put it in the dryer. Would recommend ordering an item slightly larger than your measured size."
5,Ordering Experience,"While this shirt has not been received yet due to being sent parcel post, when I contacted the company they went above and beyond to help us. I would highly recommend this company and would definitely order from them again."
2,"Vastly overrated, and you can use the stats to uncover the truth","I read this book about two years ago. It's well-written, and easy to read, but totally plays into the idea that bio/chem warfare is the way of the future for terrorists.NOTHING could be further from the truth. It is so mind-bogglingly stupid when you look at the actual facts.Here are the facts -- hundreds of millions of people have been killed by the true weapon of mass destruction -- the AK 47. Terrorists all over the world use high explosives -- because they work.A nation spun up because of straw men and false threats, which is really what bio and chem weapons are, is easy to control. That's the fact. It's not that death from these agents isn't terrible. It's just that it's hard. And it's dramatically easier to blow people up or shoot them. And that's what actually happens."
3,US CITIZENS USED AS LAB RATS,This is a straight reporting of biological warfare as it was tested on US citizens. It is the claim of this government that poisoning citizens is a valid form of defense. Read it and laugh/weep.
4,A Good Amount of Detail,"This book is a little dry and at this time somewhat dated. There is a renewed focus on this topic now so it is worth a review if you have the time. The book does not suffer from a lack of detail or facts, and it does seem to be well researched. What interested me the most was the scale of the governments ever increasing efforts to find new ways to kill the enemy. If you a looking for a historical overview of this topic, then this book fits the bill."
5,Hummingbird Smartcast,"I really like this product. The first time I used it I caught fish where I hadn't been sure there were any before that. Each time I've used it, it has lead me to the right place to catch fish."
1,Better for cats.,"When I purchased this cage I thought I had found a great cage for our 5 ferrets. It's very large and all 5 fit in there comfortably. The problem started when our youngest, smallest ferret almost immediately managed to sneak through the bars of the cage. Prevue says the bar spacing is 1"" but it's actually a bit more than that. Within 2 months of purchasing this cage, 3 of our 5 ferrets could get out of it either through climbing through the bars or pushing on the door so that with enough pressure, there is enough give in the metal to sneak out. A letter to Prevue asking them about the cage proved they don't stand behind their product - the claimed they used an ""industry standard"" of 1"" bar spacing and that my ferrets ""would get out of any cage"". Prevue advertises this model as a ferret/cat cage. If you are looking for a ferret cage, look to Superpet or Ferret Nation for a ferret cage and leave Prevue-Hendryx to modify their cages and their customer support."
5,Excellent Choice!,"Being an avid reader of dog books, and a Whippet fancier, I was excited to hear that this book was coming out. I bought it at the first opportunity! It is of special interest to those who are in the UK or who wish to use UK bloodlines in other parts of the world. However, there are excellent chapters on the breed in other lands. Also, the care information is practical and useful to new puppy owners and more experienced owners alike. The book is full of gorgeous photos and is written in an enjoyable to read style."
5,Great Florida Bluegrass,"This CD, originally put out in 2001, seems to have undergone a rebirth. That's great, because the music if first rate, and Scott is a wonderful guy. I was fortunate enough to get to see him occasionally in the late '90s in Gainesville, and he was a standout musician. He employed some top notch studio guys for this recording and does some fine original material. Great bluegrass."
2,This cd is just ok...,"I picked up Nakatomi Plaza's ""Private Property"" album which just blew my mind. What a great album from start to finishThis one....not nearly as good. The best songs on it are the ones I already heard on myspace and playlist.com, the rest of the songs are just mediocre at best.If you have to get 1 cd by Nakatomi Plaza, go get ""Private Property"""
1,Wrong color and Broken!,"I ordered a green lamp for my boyfriend. When I received it it was blue, which I might have been able to accept but the box had ""display"" written on it and when I set it up the liquid was so cloudy you could barely see the wax and even after leaving it on for 3 hours it hardly bubbled at all it just kind of made waves in the bottom pile of wax. Worst lava lamp I have ever bought!"
5,You won't be disappointed,"I was alittle hesitant on buying this lamp since it wasn't an old time lava brand. After taking the lamp out of the box, i noticed the liquid was alittle cloudy. But after the first use; it's as clear as can be! The flow of the lamp is great as well. Once you turn it on and use it more and more, the lamp will work better each time. Creative Motion did a great job creating this liquid metal lamp. A+"
4,metalic motion,"Acquiring a set of these, enjoy them a good bit. The only problem is the description says ""Metallic Green""--green as yet has not been the colour received. They are very soothing to watch, no matter what the colour. Always received promptly & in less time than expected. A fresh revisit of a classic favourite of mine."
3,Wow factor great... didn't last long,"This was exactly what the person I bought this for wanted and they still like it. However, the water often becomes very murky and just as often the ""lava"" doesn't flow up to the top, but just stays on the bottom in a big hill. But it's really awesome when it works correctly."
2,Wrong color,I ordered a green lava lamp for my son for Christmas that was from Santa. When I set it up I noticed it was red and not green. I looked at the order and it does say green and even the box says green. My son was disappointed that he asked Santa for a free lava lamp and received agreen one.
5,great book,"This book is not, and does not claim to be, the last word on all aspects of upholstery. But it is loaded with most of the basic information and step-by-step instructions that a home do-it-yourselfer would need. It is lavishly illustrated with numerous clear full-color illustrations and photos. I found it extremely helpful; excellent for the do-it-yourselfer as well as for the more serious student of upholstery who's looking for a place to start. (Its only shortcoming was not listing any sources for buying supplies.)"
2,Not For Beginners,"I found this book did not take you through the steps in a logical way. Rather the various stages were grouped for the various chairs and I found it difficult to follow each stage for my particular chair (a French Provincial or Louis XV). If however, you have a Wingback or Queen Anne chair to cover, this was given a great deal of consecutive coverage! I am doing a course at the moment in French and being not a good french speaker am keen to find a good reference book for understanding the positioning of springs for example (which we are doing in the lessons) and how to sew them in; but was informed in this book that this was too difficult and it was not covered. Certain points were done well but on the whole I found the small print and the sequencing of the information, confusing and a bit frustrating."
3,"Review of Sunset Books ""Simply Upholstery""","this book is excellent for people who already have a knowledge of upholstry, but I did not think it was the best choice for a beginner. It basically shows a step by step upholstry project (a wing back chair), that I thought was too hard for a beginner. However, for people with some upholstry projects behind them, I thought this book was great--it tackled a difficult project and used just about all the techniques you could ever want in an upholstry project."
4,Easy Upholstery,"This is a great book! It takes you through the process of reupholstery with a step-by-step explanation of tools, terminology and process. Then it provides great pictures of each step. It would appeal to a technical or visual learning style."
2,Somewhat Satisfied,"This book took way too long to get to me and wasn't in great condition. Overall, the book is okay and will be of some help."
1,"""Garbage"" w/male singer","""LA fan"" likes these guys based on seeing them live but for those of who have not seen them they sound more like ""Garbage"" with a male singer. If you like this style I suggest SKUNK ANASIE from UK."
1,Unimpressive debut,"Friend of mine turned me on to Portable, he really felt he discovered something but as I listened I figured I would not trust his opinion anymore. Portable seem to have all the elements it takes but seem to have got it just wrong. I agree with some of the other reviews, the main songwriter, Chance, seems to stuck in the past. His ""vision"" is clearly not 20/20. The band is outstanding though. Perhaps they should replace the singer..."
3,Real 60s British Invasion Style Music.,I didn't rate this album 5 or 4 star as some of the songs are kind of weak but the songs that are good are really good.For the sake of the few great songs on it the album is well worth buying.
4,Genesis - 'In The Beginning' (Black Box),"To make it a little bit more confusing, this band IS the UK band we all know for featuring Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, etc. Overall, the music here isn't bad, best described as psychedelic. Like the way this reissue expands to a 2-CD release, featuring a total of twenty-three tracks. Some of the tunes here I found to be somewhat inspiring were ""Where The Sour Turns To Sweet"", ""Serpent"", ""In Limbo"" and the demo for ""Try A Little Sadness"". Apparently, there was an American band by the same name that released a sole lp in the late '60's and vanished after that."
3,Germany? Are you on crack?,"Contrary to the description above, this Genesis was out of San Francisco, NOT Germany. This album is a fairly decent representation of the late 60's female fronted psychadelic sound common to the Haight-Asbury area...along the lines of Jefferson Airplane.Generally bohemian lyrics and some long jams, with good licks and hooks. Gloomy Sunday stands out as a song about suicide. Wonder whatever happened to this band and musicians?"
1,Different band-THE Trust,This is not the French rockers Trust but an American AOR outfit called The Trust! While its not offensive it is certainly not in the same league.
4,"Hard reading, but lots of history",I chose this book because I had some idea of what happened in Nanking and was curious about how it would be presented. It was difficult to read about the things that happened but you got a sense of families and what happened to them during this terrible time. It is hard to me to realize that life that that described can happen
4,This book is the same as Tokyo,"Beware - this book is exactly the same book as ""Tokyo"" by the same author. For some reason this book is out under both titles. So, buy either Tokyo or The Devil of Nanking...!!Whichever copy you read, it is excellent.!"
5,This book is a page turner...,"I actually randomly picked this book up at the library and thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise this book kept me up all night reading, which is hard to do, and I finished it in a few hours. This is one of the best and most capturing page turners I've read in a long time. It's suspenseful, dark, sinister, and the ending is something I was never expecting. The way Mo Hayder writes really brings you into the book and before you know it you're imagining all of the crazy characters in this story. I would highly recommend it for people who aren't afraid of the unordinary."
3,Overly long,"I liked the first two books (Birdman and The Treatment) a lot. I was really hoping for even better things in this book but found it a bit long and convoluted.The writer was aiming for a dark conclusion as is the norm with her work but this time I think went a bit into the realms of fantasy. The book didn't ring true to me.The story is really two stories in one that blend into one at the end of the book but the problem lies in both stories gradually unfolding and when one chapter ends, you start the other story for another chapter. I was continually left wanting to continue with one story or the other, and the conclusion was boredom."
4,Excellent Historical Mystery/Thriller,"The author did an excellent job writing a book that combines an excellent history of WWII China, the Rape of Nanking, and a look at modern Tokyo Nightlife. I was surprised that the writer was able to pull off combining all of these things, but she did and did it well. The book was hard to put down. I highly recommend it."
5,"If you are looking for a cozy mystery, this isn't it","Mo Hayder is one of the finest contemporary writers. Her books take you squirming and screaming to places you have never been. With a literary style, her damaged, but persevering, characters explore the depths of evil. The Devil of Nanking is an excellent novel. If it's possible, the book is even more gruesome than The Birdman and The Treatment. But this is an author who tackles the most difficult subjects. The Devil of Nanking is a fast-paced thriller into the exotic lands of Tokyo in the 1990s and Nanking during World War II."
3,So So,"The historic narrative was very interesting, but the parallel modern narrative was kind of illogical. Maybe some people do live the way the main character did in the story, but I doubt it."
4,Gripping yet disturbing,"Although the material is quite dark and disturbing, I found myself enthralled with the characters and plot. The story is told from the point of view of two people who could not be more different, but share similar dark secrets. Not for the faint of heart."
1,not at all as advertised!,"not at all as advertised. drags on, not connected and way out on the edge. assumed a book about atrocities in Nanking and good history but so far not even close."
3,"Not Her Best, But Still A Decent Read","The previous two novels that I read by Hayder were quite disturbing, so I expected something equally dark here. The book failed to live up to that same level as inBirdmanor evenPig Island. There were a few scenes that gave me chills and turned my stomach, and the plot had some very surprising twists, but ultimately, the pacing felt surprisingly slow. And by the last page, the book did not feel concluded. It ended on an unfinished, and rather unsatisfying note. The narrator's motivations were not properly explained, and Justin's role in particular was left hanging. I liked Hayder's distinctive style and her turn of phrase, but it just didn't meet my expectations for her work. I will, however, continue to keep an eye out for this talented author - but I wouldn't recommend introducing yourself to her work in this volume. It just wasn't her best."
5,gruesome,This is a compelling and terrifying book beautifully written and so visual in tone that it is cinematic! good read but not for the faint of heart
2,The heck,"Ugly, poor, bad, and strange, the other two novels by Mo Hayder were brilliant. Not this one! This is a bad crap, and not fascinating. Not recommended. The sample is enough."
4,4 1/2 stars,"With a great depth to the characters and a writing style that impresses, Mo Hayder has written a dark and sometime graphic novel that should impress all her fans.An overall good story taking place in both 90's Tokyo and Nanking of '37.Recommended."
1,What a piece of s**t,I've read both of Mo Hayders previous books and was deeply troubled by this latest one. First off I thought it read terribly and was just a piece of crap. It felt like it was a contrived effort of trying to write a novel built around her travels to Tokyo (she was a hostess like the main person in the novel). Worse off though I was deeply troubled by the book - I thought it was such a sick piece of work and really stuck in my mind for all the wrong reasons. If I could give it zero stars I would have..
4,The Devil of Nanking Review,The story had my complete attention and I couldn't put it down. It gave me nightmares after I finished the story.
2,It takes a lot of effort to read...,"If you can resist the temptation to drop it after reading a few pages, few chapters and manage to get captured you may end up liking it.It took me a lot of effort to reach the end. I found it slow, slow and slow...."
1,Pointless,"Very slow read...takes forever for the plot to develop and once it gets to the point, there is nothing there. Dull and uninteresting dialogue and events lead nowhere."
4,Horses of Today,"This is a great, easy to read book. Self gives lots of information about different breeds of horses, plus personal stories of horses she has known.An ""oldie but a goodie."""
5,A Must Read,"When I first read this book it helped clear up a good deal of confusion I had concerning God's current dealings with men today, and why we live under a silent Heaven.This book is very relevant today in view of all the terrible violence around the world, and will help believers young and old with such questions as ""Why does God allow suffering?"" and ""What has happened to miraculous interventions?""The chapter on Satan is especially informative.I strongly recommend this book."
3,"Dated language, wandering theme","Since the book was first published in 1907, the flowery style and references to long-forgotton period occurences is understandable.My biggest problem with the book is the long road that the author repeatedly takes to arrive at the points he wishes to make. The author doesn't complete his answer to the title issue (Silence) until near the end of the book and only after multiple side issues are investigated. I found a majority of these sideissues quite interesting, but I would have much rather he dealt with each of them from start to finish, prior to moving on to another topic.Further, I did not find his arguements for his positions on the subjects particularly well proven by either scripture or convention. Sorry, but thisbook was tedious for me to read, and at the end I felt I expended more effort than was necessary for the insights gained."
1,Fantasy as biography,"In a genre noted for confusing conjecture with biographical fact, Rowse must be counted among the most imaginative. Should carry a warning label."
2,What's the next step down from idiot?,"If an idiot's guide is hard to follow, what's the next step down? I found the format to be too 'busy' to follow easily, lots of information and small print. I'm not sure what could make it better, so I'm putting the blame on myself rather than the author or publisher."
2,Not all that,Very one sided. Wouldn't recomend this for anyone who was wanting to learn about the American Government.
2,I didn't think it was that good,"this book was alright. There are better books. Personally, I like Congress for Dummies a lot more. Besides, this book didn't help me on the CLEP test at all"
3,From Wild Man to Wise Man,"It's a good book on Male Spirituality. The chapters are helpful for a better understanding and appreciation of man's growth and development.I think there is an updated edition, which I thought I was buying. But it turned out to be the old edition. I wish it was listed a more specific."
5,Rohr is Spot On,"In American culture, there is simply a huge black hole of emptiness when it comes to Male spirituality. Richard Rohr makes an invaluable contribution to filling that hole. This book is no exception!"
4,excellent book for starting nature wildlife photo,"Many techniques, how-to details from a master... Don't miss this valuable informative book."
