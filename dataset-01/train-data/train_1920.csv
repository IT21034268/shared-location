4,May not be best program for novice,I like the program. It really throws you into the deep end of the pool. I just think it throws too much at you at the beggining which may discourage the novice. I reccomend Michel Thomas Spanish Deluxe for the complete beginner. After doing Michel Thomas Advance going to Assimil is probably a good next step.
4,Not worthy of bargain bin status!,"I purchased this CD when it originally came out and was pleasantly surprised by the content. It is a very underrated album, and in my opinion is by far the best of the three originals. If this album had been released in the mid to late 80's, I feel it would have sold much better than it has. The album has a more mature feel to it than the previous two. My favorite song is ""junkyard dog"" (tears on stone). For anyone who thinks Winger can't rock, listen to this one! Other notables include ""blind revolution mad"", ""down incognito"", ""spell I'm under"", and the accoustic ""who's the one."" If you enjoy accoustic guitar mixed in with screaming electric guitars, this album is for you! I highly recommend this album to hard rock fans, even if you are not a big Winger fan."
4,This should have been Winger's first album,"This is really a great bluesy based rock n roll album. Unfortunately it is all but forgotten. Kip should have waited for hair metal to die before introducing himself. Now the word 'Winger' is only recognized as the band on Stewart's shirt from Beavis and Butthead.In Cognito is my favorite song on the album, and it's a solid album. Maybe Winger should have stayed with Alice Cooper just a bit longer until Nirvana came along and crushed glam metal. Then he could have unleashed Pull onto the world giving rockers something to listen to besides whiny Seattle music. He'd probably be pretty popular today. But he's just know as 'That guy who sings Seventeen'."
2,Winger - 'Pull' (Atlantic),"Haven't really kept up with what's been happening in the Winger camp here lately.I remember not too long ago,Kip Winger did an in-store tour of Borders Books&Music.I also saw him play solo,while out on tour with Whitesnake and Warrant not that long ago.Kip was actually decent,that is for a one player act.About 'Pull',apparently his third and final 'actually' album(not counting compilations)is a let down.No where near as good as his first self-titled CD.""Down Incognito"" has a good hook,but I'm sorry to admit 'Pull' grows old awfully quick.Maybe it has something to do with the fact member Paul Taylor had exited the group.We'll never really know."
3,Solid 90's rock,"When you can find in an album two pearls like ""Spell I'm under"" and ""Down Incognito"", it's enough to get a great satisfaction. Kip gets good vocal performances also in ""In for the kill"", even if he reaches his maximun climax.Winger definitely close their hairy metal period of the precedents albums.""Pull"" is truly 90's hard rock."
3,In a heavier direction.,"This third album from Winger isn't as commercial as the previous ones. I wouldn't call Pull original, but it is much rougher and not as polished. It's not a bad album really. Reb Beach lays down some good riffs as usual. A few of the songs are forgettable, but I like a handful. ""Down Incognito,"" ""Junkyard Dog (Tears on Stone),"" and ""Spell I'm Under"" are listenable keepers. Pull has some good moments. An average listening experience."
3,It has its moments!,"This album is not in the same league as the first one, but it does rock. Check out the song ""Junkyard Dog"" It rocks harder than most anything Winger has ever done!! For the most part I would say check out Winger's first before anything else."
5,Here I go again!,"At age 57, I became a parent again to my two young grandchildren. I decided that I better do some reading to brush up on my parenting skills that I haven't had to use for a while. I honestly was relieved to find Dr. Metzger's book. His writing style was so easy to read. I found his ""What to Do"" and ""What Not to Do"" sections on each topic interesting and informative. But it's the Discussion section that I really like. To me understandng a problem or situation is really the key to being a good parent. By the end of the day with my grandkids I really don't have a lot of spare time to read. That's why I like this particular book. Whether I'm reading about anger or stealing or eating problems, Dr. Metzger gets right to the point.I highly recommend this book to all parents and grandparents or anyone who comes in contact with children or adolescents."
2,Small 8oz jar and no special taste,"I bought two jars of this blood orange marmalade based on the great review. However, this marmalade does tast great and in fact, is not one of the better blood orange marmalades on the market. The jar was a small 8 oz. for $9.50 plus shipping==$13.00 per 8oz jar...CRAZY----I did not see that jar was only that small when ordering. The taste of this marmalade is really not good..It does not have a good taste of citrus..The other reviewer must not have tasted SARABETH blood orange marmalade or JUNE TAYLOR blood orange marmalade..These two have the terrific citrus taste and SARBETH jar is 18oz FOR $11.00.."
1,Totally out of date.,"Work published in 1817, with the aim to 'examine' the relationship between polytheism and the Eleusian mysteries.Nearly the entire text is completely outdated by new archeological findings and research.The only sentences that were useful for me, were:""At the conclusion of the Mysteries of Eleusis the congregation was dismissed in these words: Conx, Om, Pax. These mysterious words are pure Sanscrit. They are Camsha, Om, Pacsha.Camsha signifies the object of our most ardent wishes. Om is the famous monosyllabic used at the conclusion of a prayer, like amen. Pacsha signifies change, course, duty, fortune.""Totally unimportant work."
3,What can I say.It's a knife.,"It's really sharp. Seems to hold an edge, and cuts stuff. It's kind of expensive though and I sometimes wonder if a considerably less expensive knife would have accomplished the same ends as effectively."
4,looking & comparing,i don't want to run this knife down & dont own one but it looks like the victorinox version which i do own it couldn't be any better than vic. & vic. is much cheaper in price w/ super quality. i look at all web sites you can find great deals if you look around.
4,Lower quality than the Classic series,"The Wusthof Gourmet knives are ""stamped"" out of a larger sheet of metal. The Wusthof Classic knives are ""forged"" and are therefore much stronger, more durable, and stay sharp longer. They also feel a bit heavier and thicker to me, which makes cutting easier. They're more expensive, but are worth it in my opinion. There is also a bolster (the thick metal portion joining the handle and the blade, which adds weight and balance and keeps the cook's hand from slipping) on the Classic Chef knife whereas this Gourmet Chef knife simply has a handle that curves into a finger guard, which is not quite as good."
3,Good Speakers for Average sound..,"I bought a pair of these speakers to use in my portable speaker box I carry around in my Blazer. They put out decent sound but they don't sound nearly as good a pair of kenwood or Pioneer speakers.If you want it loud, these will do. If your tastes are a little more refined, pony up the extra $$$ for a pair of Pioneer or Sony speakers."
5,Song list,"24 Songs: a white sport coat/the story of my life/I'm so lonesome I could cry/devil woman/begging to you/El Paso/are you sincere/I walk alone/my happiness/don't worry/ribbon of darkness/my woman,my woman, my wife/singing the blues/half as much/cool water/have I told you lately that I love you/to each his own/good hearted woman/love me tender/return to me/unchained melody/I don't know why, I just do/misty/can't help falling in love with you."
3,"Good Price, easy install, fogging inside 1 yr later","Look identical to the originals, easy to install, bulbs included a plus. Overall made car look new again, replaced yellowing fogged originals. I installed these a little over 1 year ago and I am starting to see fogging on the inner lens, hopefully this won't get worse."
3,OK Overall,"The headlight itself was/is good. The assembly kit is cheap, and didn't hold up well, so had to do some ""tweaking"" for it to hold. The kit just didn't hold it tight enough in place."
2,More like funeral classics,"If I wasn't looking for wedding music, I think this compilation would have been fine as a standard classical music compilation. However, many of the selections sound too dire, dramatic, and depressing to be played at a wedding in any setting. There are some wedding classics (like Pachelbel's Canon, etc.), but these are sung by choirs. If you are looking for a CD to play directly for your processional, recessional, etc., I would not recommend this one."
4,Truly a database....,"There is some things this book is not - it is not meant to explain and summarize each and every story. Its main focus is on the characters, mostly on Nero, Archie and those of the extended detective family. While it lists information about the different stories and events, the author refused to spoil it for you. If you want to know more you HAVE to read the books. The book also shows us the history of Nero Wolfe on the radio, on TV and even on the big screen. It has chapters on both his love of food and on his harem of flowers. It also has a small bio on Rex Stout and tries to trace the life, and loves, of Archie Goodwin. A wonderful book but no replacement for reading the mysteries. Enjoy it like a fine meal."
3,statistics,"While full of the sort of details and comparisons to Rex Stout himself, the book has a lot of statistics, e.g., how many times a particular character is mentioned within the 74 books/stories...for die-hard Stoutians only."
3,RAINBOW OF TALES,"In ""The Past Present"", Sylvia Petter chases a rainbow of tales that wander from the beaches and blue mountains of Australia to the hotel lobbies and conference halls of an international career. Lighthearted nonsense punctuates memories of war and uprisings, unhappy affairs and broken marriages or the enduring love for a child, a friend, an ageing man. Grim or tender, she speaks in many voices, adopts many guises. Convincingly."
4,Footnote in history makes for an exciting adventure.,"Telegraph operator George Kennan signs on to build a telegraph line across Siberia in late 1800s. Very good American example of understated adventure writing, a genre probably perfected by the British."
4,beautiful cover for Tent Life in Siberia,Too bad of Amazon to entice with a beautiful cover but neglect to mention that the many other paintings and illustrations mentioned in the preface are not in this edition. The space and title of the illustration is there - on a blank page.
2,COULD BE BETTER,This book is missing the theory and it's examples are horribly vague. It also needs more examples in certain areas such as spillways and sedimentation.
3,INTERESTING BUT NOT A CLASSICAL TEXTBOOK,"I'm an engineer involved in the design of large hydraulic structures.The reference textbooks ( ""the bible"" ) for open channel hydraulics is still the old ""Open Channel Hydraulics"" by Ven Te Chow.This book is interesting but lacks for charts, diagrams and/or formulas for designing the hydraulic structures.I suggest to buy it only after Ven Te Chow or Henderson's classical textbooks.However please consider it if you're involved in the design of stepped spillways."
4,You have to see this,"I will have to say this is a very good film,becase it will make you think before you step."
5,"Thrilling but moving, highly recommended.","Desert Claw is an exciting, high-octane action thriller. Following a complicated deal struck between the British Government and a Kuwaiti prince, a team of ex-Special Service agents are forced to retrieve a valuable painting from a hostile location. Be prepared for double-crossing, ambushes and hand-to-hand combat as the expedition takes a series of unexpected twists and turns. It is also important not to overlook the attention paid by the author to the human cost of war, especially in developing countries. Some particularly gruesome moments oscillate between exciting and appalling as the reader straddles a line between fiction and reality - especially in the context of an all-too-familiar conflict. All in all, a fantastic short book."
4,"Fun, Quick, and Entertaining Read","I believe that my title sums this book up pretty well.You will read this book/short story in one sitting - therefore the story is quick and full of excitement/action. Damien Lewis is a great author who knows how to write a compelling war/action story. I have read everything that he has put out thus far and am yet to be let wanting. Again, recommended.Note: this book is around 100 pages and is not his usual full-length. I was unaware of this when I bought it. Just an FYI."
5,"Awesom Price, Awesome Project!","So glad I could find this on Amazon. Saved more than $10.00 off of regular retail price at all of my local pet stores. My dog has been sick, in part due to regular name-brand dry foods. Too many additives and by-products hidden behind a ""healthy"" label. Wellness allows me to feed my dog food that will not make her sick. I can pronounce the ingredients and she loves the Healthy Weight Recipe, despite it being a ""diet"" formula. As a dog living with colitis, limiting fat and increasing fiber intake is vital to her IT health. This food makes it easy and she still regards it as a treat six months after starting to eat it in her bowl. She is a finicky eater, and I have spent hundreds of dollars on various ""diet"" foods from the vet and pet boutiques. This was the first formula she liked right out of the bag. What a relief! Five star product!"
5,Wellness Super5 Mix Healthy Weight Dog Food,"Excellent food with first ingredient being deboned chicken. My border collie loves it and is doing well on it. It was delivered quickly and Amazon's price was better than anywhere I had ever purchased from. I also didn't have to put it in a cart, push it to my car, transfer it from the car to the kitchen. Came right to my front door. Thanks Amazon for such great service."
2,Seems better for the owner rather than the dog,"We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight. The ingredients seemed great, but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5-7 times per day! The food did little to help with weight reduction (even with all the vomiting), and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian-prescribed food instead. (Note: Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem.) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food, his stool has become firmer and less frequent, and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis.As I stated above, the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious, but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else."
1,Made my dog sick,"I was feeding my dog the Complete Wellness but decided that she needed to watch her weight so I started feeding her this weight one. She started vomiting daily. I figured it was probably the food since it started happening right around the time we got her on the new one. I took her to the vet just in case and the vet agreed that I should stop feeding her this food and put her on a bland diet for 5 days. Once she stopped eating this food, she was fine. I'm going to be switching her to a new brand because I'm hearing some sketchy things about Wellness."
5,best,"i only feed my chihuhuas Wellness Super 5 mix. It is very healthy for them, their coats are so soft and shiny and both girls are healthy and i feel it is from this dog food. They can't get enough of it"
3,chow hound doesn't love it,"My dog has Cushings and will almost eat the wallpaper off the walls, but he is unenthusiastic about this food. Granted, the food he was on before was Orijen grain free, and with the significantly lower calorie count in the Wellness, it's bound not to taste as good."
4,Always a great product and great for weight loss,"Wellness was always my go to kibble, specially when one of my dogs had to lose weight. I have since switched to canned food which is much better for dogs' digestive system (and much more effective for weight management). However, as far as kibbles go, this particular Wellness worked very well."
5,Excellent dog food,"We have two collies, one 11 year old and one 3 1/2 years. We have to watch what we feed our senior, because he has a sensitive digestive system. We also have to watch the 3 1/2 year old because she has pancreatitis and a low fat food is good for her so that she keeps an even weight. We tried many different dog foods including premium holistic foods and prescription foods. We have used the Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight food for about 2 months. So far, both of them seem to be doing well. They like it well enough that we use the dry kibbles for their treats. I will update the review in another few months."
3,Good ideas but hard to apply,This is a good resource for anyone that works with children. However it is hard to apply many of the ideas to a math and science classroom. Quick read.... Probably worth your time even if you are not teaching English.
2,"small, but not small enough",I had high expectations for this book because of Johnston's work with Richard Allington...however I was under whelmed. This book could have been written on a one page handout - one side containing what things teachers should be saying to students and one side containing what things teachers should not be saying to students. A simple paragraph on each page would provide more than enough explanation.
2,Required Reading,"I was required to read this book for my grad work in Urban Education. This book reads like a manual for elementary through junior high school Arts teachers--I am a Secondary Math teacher so it didn't work quite so well for me. As far as direct content, very detailed examples (too detailed for me). A lot of picking apart the most basic phrases. Felt like only using the language discussed would be condescending to high school students and afraid that saying a million variations of ""good job"" would cause the praise to lose meaning."
5,Great condition and speedy delivery!,This book came in the condition it described and came before the expected date! Thanks!
1,Choice Words,"I did not recieve the book after a 2-wk wait. I originally gave a poor rating, then revoked it on This Old Firehouses's request & offer for a 1/2-price rate on my next purchase. I STILL NEED THE BOOK & am waiting for a reply to my email that asks HOW I make a 1/2 - price purchase. There are other cys available.Linda Miller"
4,Choice Words,Choice Words was a great read! The book provided applicable real-classroom strategies that could be used in any educational setting. I would especially recommend this book for any new teacher.
5,She's done it again!,"This is a wonderful book for children and grown-ups alike. Hannah is a girl who never seems to age, yet she cannot remember where she comes from. She can heal anything by just plucking the flowers and plants that sprout from her head with her hair, and using them with instructions that form in her mind. She will lead you through her world, where she is looked after by her animal friends, when she confronts the wizard that says he created her, when she falls in love, when she leaves Tanglewood and embarks on a quest to find her lovers queen, and finally when she returns home and descovers what really lays at the heart of Tanglewood. If you are a fan of Ms Pierce's work, I highly recomend this wonderful book."
4,Small TV stand,"The Allsop Camden TV stand is well designed - simple, streamlined, sturdy. I use it to raise a 32"" flat screen TV to provide space for a speaker in front of the TV and have sufficient clearance for the TV's electronic 'eye'."
4,SISQO RULZ !!!,"I have been a HUGE fan of Dru Hill ever since they first showed up. And simular to many of you , I now love Sisqo. I bought this single in anticipation of hearing how he would sound by himself. Well............... He sounds tight !!!! I love this cd. I love all the songs on it , and I suggest you all get it A.S.A.P. !!"
3,Great CD - not great value,"I love the CD, but there are only 6 tracks. With the multitude of Christmas songs to choose from, it should have been much more."
2,Michael Bublea,I thought this CD was OK but not the best one that MB has done. I really like his music and was kinda disappointed in this CD.
2,Michael Buble Christmas CD: Let it Snow,"This is my first Michael Buble CD & I wasn't blown away by it. There's only 5 songs, none of which are very impressive. Not a great Christmas album."
2,Micheal Buble Let It Snow,There were only six songs to begin with and the songs were not entertaining at all
2,nice - just not long enough,I like this CD a lot - the music is very nice - but the CD is over almost before I realize it's playing. I would like a much longer version!
4,Let It Snow,Great holiday music! Classic Michael Buble. My only complaint is that the CD should be twice as long. It is very lacking with only 6 cuts. Otherwise most enjoyable.
3,not enough songs,"I was disappointed by the number of songs on the CD, and two are repeats. I guess $1/song is still the same as iTunes, but I was nonetheless disappointed."
2,"Buble phones it in, but it's still Buble","The album or ""EP"" seems hastily contrived, missing those classy arrangements (except for the live cut) but its still Buble's impecible voice. I have to conclude that its mostly a holiday revenue generating effort on the part of MB and producers with not much heart in it."
3,Not much for the money,"I was a little disappointed with this CD. I expected more songs and a little different sound from this artist. It's a good CD, just not one ofhis better ones."
5,Michael Buble' Let It Snow Cd,"This Cd is a ""Must have""! It only has 6 tracks on it, but it is by far the best Christmas cd I own. I rotate it through the other cd's I have in my player because I love it so much! This man has the voice of melted butted, he's somewhat of a mix of Vic Damone, Andy Williams, and Mel Torme'. You will love this Cd, it will be a family favorite for years to come."
3,I Used to Really Like Him,Not so much anymore. Didn't care much for the album before this. One shouldn't mess with Christmas classics and he does. This is probably my last Buble album.
5,Michael Buble at Christmas...wish there were more songs!,"Even though I wish he had a few more Christmas songs in his repetoire, I am satisfied with this collection of holiday selections by Mr. Michael Buble. His voice is rich and resonating with the sounds of Christmas! Nice work and a nice price for this C.D.!!"
4,If My Dad Likes it Anyone Will...,"Love the music! So much talent, but I wish the CD was a little longer. It's only about 20 minutes long...I would definately recommend this holiday CD. Think Frank Sinatra, but with some modern flair. My dad is really particular about holiday music & even he liked it!"
4,Light and pleasing - nice mix of sound and style,"I picked this up in a Christmas shop and popped it in my car player. Out flowed a lovely, airy array of music porduced by well matched and well trained young voices. There were some classic Christmas themed songs, and a few funny songs, some well produced vocal/instrumental pieces, and an a capella piece or two. I paid a lot more for this impulse purchase than you would on Amazon, but it's worth adding to your winter music collection in any case. This is not your standard collection of Christmas classics, and can be enjoyed anytime you want to escape to a cooler frame of mind."
5,Great Holiday Music!,Let It Snow was the perfect background music to my holiday festivities. Michael Buble with his amazing voice brings new life to these classic holiday songs.
2,buble Christmas CD,"I was disappointed that the CD had very few songs recorded on it. The first song is repeated as the final song. That is a literary technique that can work well for the written word, but here it felt cheating."
2,disapointed,I was so excited when i got the cd in the mail... only tan to find it only had 6 songs! Its not that hard to come up with more than 6 christmas songs... disapointed!
3,I was expecting more than just a light flurry...,"Michael Buble has a terrific voice and these are very nice numbers, but there aren't many of them. This album has six tracks and two of them are ""Let it Snow!"" (studio and concert versions). At least they used the right title since that song is 1/3 of the total. I would have given it fewer stars but what's here is good. I'm a sucker for ""Grown Up Christmas List"" (no matter the artist). Buble fans will enjoy the sounds. The rest of you might feel let down."
3,Half An Album,"I guess that half an album is better than none but if you're only going to offer up a half dozen tracks why would you include the same song twice (a studio and a live version)? If you're a fan of Michael Buble, as I am, then there is no reason in the world why you wouldn't enjoy this seasonal CD. Everything you've come to expect from Michael is here - except there just isn't very much of it. Sure the CD is inexpensive but most people don't base their decision to purchase on price alone. It would have made so much more sense to have done an additional half dozen or so tracks which would have doubled the enjoyment. While I certainly wouldn't suggest that you not purchase this album I do think that it's important to know in advance that, although you might find it very enjoyable, you're not getting very much music regardless of the price."
5,Let it Snow Buble,"If you enjoy listening to any of Michael Buble' CDs, you will love his holiday music."
4,Worth it for The Christmas Song alone,"All the numbers on this CD are great, but it is worth buying for The Christmas Song alone. Combining Mel Torme's most famous composition, Michael Buble's voice, and a marvelous arrangement by Johnny Mandel produces a performance over the top. Mel must be pleased, wherever he may be."
1,Let it Snow - Michael Buble,"I would never have spent $10 on a CD that only had six songs - that is a waste of time and money...I feel ripped off! Even though I like Michael Buble, I'll probably never buy another one of his for this reason."
1,"""Let It Snow"" Michael Buble","Although I love Buble, I was VERY disappointed with this CD. Just when I was getting into the music, it was OVER. I thought my player stopped on its own, but Nope! I was shocked to discover that his CD only has 6 songs on it. In comparison, Groban has 13 songs on his new Christmas CD. Guess who I'm gonna be listening to?!"
1,Micheal Buble WHO?,"Okay this album is boring but what can your expect? I mean who is Micheal buble? I'll tell you a nobody, and will always be a nobody...Take my advice dont buy nobodies who wants to be somebody cause they songs always TRASH JUST LIKE MICHEAL BUBLE!"
3,Short Christmas CD,"Nice voice, good music but there are only 6 songs on this CD so it plays very quickly. Most CD's have twice that amount so I felt a bit short changed and should have noticed that before purchase."
5,Classic Bublé!,"Adding his personal mark to classic tunes, a smooth, grown up collection of holiday music."
4,Buble's Christmas treat,"Mr. Buble has a wonderful voice, and this CD doesn't disappoint, very nice addition to other Christmas music..."
4,Boy Crooner sings Christmas,"This CD could have held more songs, but the ones it does have are excellently done and a pleasure to listen to."
3,Holiday music,"As stated by another reviewer, this CD only contains 5 or 6 Christmas songs. I purchased it because I wanted some Christmas music by Michael Buble, a great performer. Thanksfully, through Amazon, it didn't cost me much."
5,Let It Snow and also Noel,"Both of these albums were great. I gave them to my daughter for her birthday and she loved them. There should be more great singers like these two people, not most of the ones that think they can sing nowadays but they just sound like pigs at a feeding trough, can't understand half of what they are saying."
4,"Michael Bublé's ""Let it Snow""","Michael's mellow voice and dynamic musical arrangements on many ""old standards"" gives a refreshing change to sometimes overplayed Christmas music. However, the arrangements are complimentary to each piece, not testing out his ability to alter the music so it is unrecognizable. Excellent renditions of traditional music PLUS several new songs that change up the selection. Well worth the money!"
3,Michael Buble's Christmas CD,"It's a good Christmas CD with Michael's take on the Christmas song. It is too short though, just 6 songs."
5,I wish....,...there were more songs on this 'EP'. Wish it were a full length seasonal CD. But I'll take what I can get of this wonderful singer.
2,a stocking of coal!,"This CD has 6 songs on it and actually Let it snow is repeated so really there is only 5 songs. 5 songs? I have had ""sampler"" CD's that were longer. Granted the songs were good...but still makes me wonder if next year there will be a longer more ""finished album"" Make sure you know what you are getting."
3,Michael Buble Christmas music,Always a fan of Michael Buble but this one is a little too short.It made an ok addition to our already large collection of x-mas music.
3,Like a good snow that melts the next day,"Buble is a musical genius. 'Let it Snow' doesn't show that much. While Buble's vocals are interesting & excellent (as usual), this CD doesn't display a lot of creativity in the music itself. It is fun to listen to a few times, but nothing to blow you away, as with his other CDs."
3,buble',I don't believe it's worth the money. You get only 6 songs for the regular price of a CD. He's good but not that good!
3,short and not so sweet,"There are only 7 songs on this CD and the last one skipped and jumped all over the place. The first six songs are gorgeous and Mr Buble sounds great, but the final song was damaged no matter what player we tried it on. Too bad."
2,Michel Buble,I was very disappointed in Let It Snow. Even though I am a huge fan of Michael Buble this was not up to his standard performance.
2,I feel screwed.,"What is this... the shortest CD I've ever purchased. How can one be led to believe you're getting a ""normal"" length CD only to be sold short. Shame on Buble. I'm not such a fan anymore."
2,Where's the rest of the CD?,"Hey Michael - where's the rest of your CD??? Just six (6) songs, a little more than 20 minutes of music, not all that thrilled with his selection of songs and his version of those songs. Felt sorta cheated, very dissappointing...LAM"
1,I expected more songs,I love Michael Buble! I was very disappointed to see once I got the CD it contained only six songs. I was expecting a larger collection of Christmas music.
4,Short but Sweet!,"The short album has nonregilious Christmas songs that are more reflective of the winter months than about the religious occasion. It's always nice to hear Buble`, but would like to hear more of Buble and more of Christmas too!"
2,6 songs?,"Though wonderful singing, this CD only has 6 songs, and two of them are the same! (one live and one recorded)"
2,IT OK,"For the price it is ok, but I expected more than 6 songs. I was disappointed to say the least."
2,not this time,"Michael Bubal'e falls way short here, I expected so much more...what was he thinking?His choices here do not rise to the holiday season of joy. His sad tone is mood busting."
1,ONLY 6 SONGS??,I love Michael Buble's music but was extremely disappointed that there were only 6 songs on this cd. I would not have bought it had I known that.I guess I should have read the reviews as others have stated the same disappointment.I thought with a 4+ star rating I didn't need to check the reviews!What's a Christmas musisc cd with only 6 songs???
3,love Michael Buble.....,I love Michael Buble but I was a bit disappointed that there were only 6 tracks and not many upbeat songs. I look forward to a complete holiday CD or maybe even DVD holiday special next year! Left me wanting more....
4,Love it but it's a bit short,"Although this album is beautiful and fun, there are only some 6 tracks on this CD and two of the songs are the same, one being a live version. I was hoping for at least 13 songs."
1,Poor quality and very uncomfortable,"I bought these for my daughter who developed terrible blisters inside of ONE HOUR wearing them. I put them on myself, and I am surprised she was able to last an hour wearing them. They are horrifically uncomfortable. Hard mesh=not good on your feet."
4,A great tabletop easel for a great price!,"My son is only 21 months old, so I wasn't sure how he would do with an art easel. I therefore didn't want to spend a lot of money on it--which makes this the perfect choice for me! I set it up for him yesterday, and he's been playing with it ever since. I prefer that he use crayons and paper at this age (rather than the messy chalk and dry erase markers), so I used a clip to attach some paper to the easel and he's been coloring away! Once he's a little bit older, I'll introduce the markers and the chalk. The easel seems durable, but I can't comment on that really, since its only been one day. Even if it doesn't last that long, it was a small price to pay for a good activity."
1,Mr. Crappy,"Do not waste your $30.00. I purchased this coffee maker 6 months ago & threw it out this past weekend. I purchased this because I thought I was buying a reliable coffee maker with a reliable brand name. It leaks all over the counter. When you poor your coffee it leaks from the carafe. It drips coffee all over the warming plate, then proceeds to sizzle and stinks your kitchen up with the smell of burning coffee. If you enjoy coffee all over your counters, then perhaps you will like this coffee maker. If not, then spend your money elsewhere."
2,Waste of Money,"Very disappointed in this coffeemaker. We had our old Mr. Coffee for 8 years and it was still working when we decided to get a new one. Since the previous Mr. Coffee had worked so well, we did not hesitate to buy another one. Replacing the new machine after only 2 months of use. Yes, ours did leak. It leaks when you try to fill the water reservoir and it leaks when you pour the brewed coffee. It has leaked grounds and overflowed on the counter and floor 3 times, for 3 different people. It happened to my husband last night and included some weird white substance that is proving very difficult to remove from the cupboards and drawers it spilled onto. At first, we thought it had stripped the finish off of the wood but it really appears to be a chalk-like stain that does not come off with normal cleaning of soap and water. Off to the store to buy a new coffeemaker - not Mr. Coffee."
3,A small pouch,"I really like this ""coin purse"". I wish that the dimensions were listed, though, so I would have had a better idea about what I was purchasing. It's about 4"" by 3"", so it's good for lip gloss and such, but not much else. The shape is nice and it appears to be of good quality. I hope this helps other who may wonder, ""Hmmm, how big is it?"""
2,Not one of the Hip's frontman finer moments,"First off I'm a huge fan of the Tragically Hip and Gordon Downie. After the 2001 ""Coke Machine Glow"" (Gordons first solo release) I was expecting more growth and better quality. Boy was I wrong! Words can't describe what is wrong with this CD. I truly hope that Gordon put this together in one day or was suffering from a mental breakdown. I reccomend that you don't purchase this album. But I did enjoy a few tracks and they we're ""Pascals Submarine"" and ""Christmastime in Toronto"" So if your looking for a Hip type sounding alubum this product doesn't do that so I suggest any Hip album out there. And also keep Gordon in your prayers so he doesn't make another solo album again."
2,Not Bloomfield's best,"After reading a great deal about Mike Bloomfield I was looking forward to hearing some great Gospel and Ragtime acoustic guitar, but I was disappointed. This was not his best. I'm sure he did better work with the Butterfield Blues band."
3,Good but boring,"I am a very big fan of AI, but this was one of the bad items. I mean if you really like the songs just buy a Karoke CD. The only thing I liked that you have the lyrics with the notes (unlike Karoke) and the sheet music so you can play on a piano."
1,Not what I thought it was,"I thought this book gave the secrets to get you in, but I could have written the pointers they gave and some of the suggested songs in the book are not really ideal songs to sing acapella. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great Book for Security Theory - Easier read than CISSP.,"I gave the book 4 stars as it covers the theories of security very well and was somewhat easier to read than the CISSP books. They cover roughly the same topics, but teach differently. If you can read and understand the CISSP books, then this will be a breeze."
3,disapointed,"this item looks as the picture shows. however, the sizing is off. it runs 1-2 sizes too big. other than that, it's a cute garment."
2,Cute but...,This item was adorable but who wants the extra work of stacking diapers in here & then taking out of here. The changing table shelf worked just as well & held more diapers. We loved the pattern but it's not worth the money...
3,This is not a 5 star album!,"3 stars just because they don't suck. They have a few good songs,but the rest are lacking.Kids in the way have amazing potential. If you have heard ""Fiction"" or the titled song ""Apparitions of Melody"" You would know it. like their debut album they have ""Love,Kids in the way, and phonix with a heartache"".Each a great song, and I mean it, 1 out of 10 they would all fall in between 8 to 10 ratings.They have a exellant singer who has a very different voice, very unique, rare voice. His screams I could tell from a hundred others. Once you hear it, you would know how unique it is.[...]They're only able to bring the magic on those songs. The rest are just plain. Ulimatly this is a fair cd. Some great songs but not a great cd."
1,Mondo Cane/Mondo Cane 2,"The quality of the video is worse than poor. I have tried the tape in multiple machines and get poor tracking. The program is very interesting, but the poor quality over rides the benefits. I will be returning it."
2,Becareful if you're Mexican,"I ordered this sauce because I love the smokey delicate taste that the Chipotle chile is known for. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. This sauce didn't have much to offer. For starters it wasn't very hot. It's flavor was saturated with way too much vinegar and its was to sweet making it difficult to mix well with any Mexican food. Now I grew up with at least 5 home-made sauces and salsa on the table at all times so I've had my sure of hot sauces and I place this sauce right below ""Tapatio"". Let this be a Warning to all Mexicans your moms sauce is probably better! Or If you want the real stuff gets some Chipotles and eat them right out of a can.... If you can handle it."
5,Husband Loves it,Purchased an assortment of hot sauces for my husband to spice up dinner-time foods. He was very happy with this sauce.
5,big fan,"I found this stuff at my Mexican market years ago. It has an awesome smoky flavor and a nice sweet finish. This is the next best thing to a can of chipotles in adobe and a lot easier to deal with when you need a little something in a recipe. I use it in all kinds of things to add depth of flavor: soups, roasts, greens, dressings, mashed potatoes, marinades, bloody Marys. I could go on for a long time but you get the idea. It's not that spicy. That's what makes it so versatile."
2,Terrible Tunes,"This radio is very very small.The stations do not come in good at all.The only thing I liked about it, is the flashing disco lights.I gave it to my 6 year old son, he likes it.Even though he can only get one station to come in somewhat clear."
4,Hot CD!,"Track Listing1)Unleash The Dragon - Album Version 2)Unleash The Dragon - Dreem Team Remix 3)Thong Song Uncensored feat. Foxy Brown 4)Thong Song - Jonathan Peters Bust Radio Remix 5)Got To Get It - Jonathan Peters 6)Thong Song (Enhanced Full Video)This is a really good single, it has remixes of his previous singles. The best track is track 4 (Thong Song - Jonathan Peters Bust Radio Remix). This track was previously unavailable. Also the good thing about this CD is it is uncensored, so it's in it's full version."
1,best of kitaro,"Once again pioneer are to blame for another poor quality DVD,im talking about picture quality it is simply inferior and not upto what is expected of the format,like an ""enchanted evening"" give it a miss until pioneer get their act together and produce a disc worthy of buying."
2,"very good sound, terrible video","While I'm quite pleased with the sound quality (4 stars) of this DVD, the video quality is pathetic and inexcusable. Even worse than an old movie made in the 1940s. Almost like looking through a haze. The color is so discolored, reddish, yellowish, whatever. It gets progressively worse. When I reached track No. 10, I had a headache and had to turn off the TV. Now, I can only use it as an audio CD. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
1,Disappointed,"This bra was well made, fabric very soft but the sizes were way off. Cup is cut to big, it would be difficult to wear a scoop, or v neck top , as the cup covers to much of chest area. Would not buy this brand again or style again, even for $7 each."
5,Finally!!!,"This is absolutely the most comfortable underwire bra I have ever worn! The support is excellent, the price is great and I will definately order more. Love it!"
4,"A fun, romping lesbian mystery!","This book is fun! Not exactly high literature, but that's more than okay. The highlights definitely are the hot yet playful sex scenes, and the dialogue in general is also quite good. The plot keeps you on your toes, though it is as much a romance as a mystery. The main character is simultaneously a trouble maker and quite endearing. For a light, fun read I highly recommend this book!"
4,Unknown Plot...,"This was an enjoyable read with very little distinct plot. The main character, Kelly, is involved in:- juggling two girlfriends (who happen to be best friends)- delivering mysterious packages for an ex-FBI agent (who may be a good guy or a bad guy)- playing bodyguard for one of her current girlfriend's exes- teaching karate and learning from her sensei- playing matchmaker for her live-in brother- saving money for college- worrying about lesbians in the Army- and more.To make matters worse, she's trying to keep most of these activities secret.There were many little plots, but there wasn't one overriding story. Even so, the book was interesting, funny in parts, and intriguing. Only about half of the ""mini plots"" had any closure at the end, leaving Clevenger open to a sequel. However, I think this would only be prolonging a mediocre storyline and would be a mistake. Good for weekend entertainment, but not a book that will stick with you for days after reading."
4,top secret,"TOP SECRETHi my name is London. I am reading Top Secret by John Reyndds. The reason I picked this book is because it's funny when he turns green. It's also sad because his teacher Miss. Green told him to do a project on lipstick. He got mad, so he went to his room and thought to do something else for a science project. It was human photosynthesis!My connections to this book are when he had a secret about a science project. For instance, my mom says not to shoot my gun, but I still do it. I recommend this book to my family because it's funny and interesting."
4,read Top Secret and you might turn into a plant too!,"This book is about a child named Allen Brewster that discovered the mystery of HUMAN PHOTOSYNTHESIS.Nobody believed Allen except for grandpop.Ms.Green, Allen's teacher won't let Allen do his science project on HUMAN PHOTOSYNTHESIS.Instead Ms.Green wants Allen to do his science project on lipstick.One day,Allen went to the library to do research on human photosynthesis. The next day, Allen wasn't allowed to go to the library because he was there too long. One day, Allen went to a hotel that was supposed to be in. When he got up to the room, he met the President's advisor, Mr. Kirby. Mr. Kirby told Allen that his discovery was Top Secret. So, Allen had to change back and the President sent Allen the project he was supposed to do. If you want to know what happens next, then you should read the book."
5,Fond memories,"I was trying to think of an interestig way to introduce photosynthesis to my students. I remembered Top Secret, which I read in elementary school myself. This book is so wonderful that twenty years later I still remember how much I liked it. I am so happy that I can share this book with my students!"
5,"""Avoiding Prison, Adventures in Romance & Danger""","I just finished reading this book and it was as much fun as a mini-vacation without having to endure airports/packing/customs. Her family, friends, and love interests are an amusing cast of characters, and the unusual places she visits give the book an exotic flavor of adventure, reminiscent of ""Romancing the Stone."" I especially enjoyed her South American escapades. Her descriptive writing gives a strong feeling of being there, and is delightfully witty and entertaining. Overall a fun summer read, but there are parts that draw you in poignantly to her problematic and romantic encounters. Highly recommended to anyone for an enjoyable travel/romance/zany read."
2,If you enjoy promiscuity and drunkeness then this is for you,"Although it had it's moments, this book is largely non-fiction beach trash. Wendy wastes most of her time in bed instead of our experiencing the rich cultures these countries offer."
2,Mediocre at best,"I read this book while vacationing at the Outer Banks. It is an easy read and does have some humerous moments. However, as a person from Latin America I found some of her commentaries offensive. She constantly refers to countries as being ""Third World"" countries and is very condescending about Latin American culture. I had a very hard time liking the author as she describes her adventures. I would not recommend this book to others."
1,Stupid Travel Tips,"The book is hardly about travel but more accurately about Wendy's dysfunctional life. While reading the book, all I could really feel was pity--not a sense of adventure. I only hope this was fiction and not a true rendition of Wendy's foreign travels."
5,Seize the Day!,"Wendy brings laughter and romance back into travel writing. Learn to bend the rules as you go with her to places no Americans are permitted to go. This book is for anyone who wonders if they're wasting their life inside an office cubicle, or for anyone troubled by crowded beaches and graffiti-worn tourist traps. Wendy strides headlong into foreign lands, ready to learn what it means to be a citizen of the world. Is she asking for trouble? Perhaps, but this coming-of-age account of a very brave young woman shows there's far more to life than worry over lost luggage."
3,an ok read,"The book starts off great, but half way through you realize that her experiences are mostly due to her parents quirks and not her own. If it wasn't such a short book I wouldn't have bothered to finish it. If you are looking for an interesting woman's travel tale this is not it."
2,Little Bo-Peep,"This book is a fluid and easy read yet I still found myself an avid reader, unable to finish it. The author talks about her little-bo-peep adventures like the hardships and interesting things she experiences have made her a wise sage. Her voice becomes redundant and obnoxious. While she seeks these hardships she can talk to no end about, she is a middle class white girl whose mundane life bores even her to death. I found no moral, lesson, or value from reading most of this book. The author appears bright and probably likable, but reading this book was like being on a bad date in which the person accross the table will not stop talking about how bright they are, tough they have had it, adventures they have had etc......"
4,A good film about wanting more,"A good ""coming of age"" type film here with hints of The Graduate and American Beauty. The acting and direction are enough to keep you interested despite the somewhat hollow storyline."
1,Complete waste of time!,This whole movie is someone's daydream that should have never been put on tape. Any amateur could have done a video of this quality. The producers should be sued for the time wasted to watch this garbage. There is no redeeming moment in this video. DVD is already in the garbage. I would not insult my friends by passing this on to them.
1,terrible movie,"Surprisingly bad performances by actors I previously thought better of. The plot could have been decent but all characters were unrealistic, over-the-top caricatures of stereotypes. Seriously. The dialog was also truly amiss. Overall, I really haven't seen a film as bad as this--and I've been streaming pretty bad free movies lately. This one I actually rented! I would only recommend this film to my worst enemies."
3,Testament - 'Return To The Apocalyptic City' (Atlantic),"Some fans would say that this isn't EVEN Testament anymore, with guitarist Alex Skolnick and drummer Louie Clemente having jumped ship. If anything, I thought by THIS point, the thrash band had maybe become more commercial. Plus at the same time had remained loyal to their long time fans. By today's standards, 'Return...' of course is an EP, with six cuts and a duration of thirty minutes. It's still decent, at least I thought so. Liked reliving the mosh goodies like ""So Many Lies"", ""Disciples Of The Watch"", ""Haunting"" and the semi-main streamish ""Return To Serenity"". Give this disc a shot. You might like it."
5,Love It!,"We hung this border in our daughter's room last weekend. We had no trouble getting the paste to stick, and we did not have the dripping paste problem that one of the other reviewers seemed to have. I think if you let the pasted paper ""book"" for two to three minutes it hangs beautifully. Just soak the paper in the tub for 1 minute and then fold it paste to paste and let it sit for 2-3 miutes. Of course, as you hang it , be wiping the paper (and the wall) with a damp sponge to keep air bubbles out and to keep it from lifting.The baby's room came out beautiful because of the border--we love it!"
3,"Almost, but not quite....","A good product but for one thing. It comes installed with Vista, but the video card is not quite powerful enough to handle the OS properly."
4,Just the essentials,"This book tells you only what you need to know about these bluegrass tunes. The structure of the song and the chord that goes with it. No melody or lyrics, just song structure. For what it is, it is well laid out and easy to understand."
1,Ridiculous,"Having read and enjoyed ""The Bestseller"" a few months back I was very disappointed with ""Young Wives."" It should have been entitled ""First Wives Club Part II"" because it has the same plot. I don't know how the author could have come up with ridiculous shemes for revenge. I will never again buy a book by Olivia Goldsmith."
1,"Concept fiction is good, but take this author's agenda away!","Olivia Goldsmith did a great job with _First Wives Club_, and her ""concept"" fiction -- that is, stuff built up around Hollywood (_Flavor of the Month_), fashion (_Fashionably Late_), or publishing (_The Bestseller_) -- was even better.But the problem is that when she attempts to construct a story without a theme, it ends up with a theme.Repeat after me: ""Men are bad. Men are evil. Men are pigs.""I'm as feminist as the next woman, but come freaking on. I can only tolerate so much drivel personifying Evil Comes In The Y Chromosome.It's really sad, because her earlier fiction is great. This stuff is pathetic."
1,Stop the Insanity,"I've really enjoyed this author's earlier works, but this novel left me flat. The storylines were painfully predictible. There were some jewels hidden in the mire, though it wasn't really worth the effort to find them. I found myself saying please finish and let the pain stop. The stories were contrived and generally unbelievable."
1,This book disgusted me,"It's not about the boring style and flat characters, but the fact that the 'heroes' show such a despicable behavior that I was upset in reading it. These women faces bad husbands, we agree, but they pay them back with such a disgusting behavior that shows how they are not a bit better than them. I couldn't help feeling bad for the children. This book should be a manual about how not to behave during divorce, no matter if you're wife or husband."
1,trash to the trash,"Based on the excellent, clever movie ""The First Wives Club"", I bought two of Olivia Goldsmith's books. Both went into the trash. ""Young Wives"" is disapponting and poorly written with a very preditable, stereotypical plot. I have never taken the time to review a book, but this one was such a waste of time and money, I feel obligated to warn other readers - beware."
4,This book is a riot!,"At first I thought ""Young Wives"" was boring and slow. I was wrong! After the first half of the book, Jada and Michelle meet Angela and their lives really take on a new twist! I think Angela was the saving point of this story. Jada and Michelle are suddenly single women with children and Angela has a problem of her own to deal with. I think Jada's decision regarding her children was a good move, however her drastic measures to get them from Clinton was a bit much. I would not recommend doing what she did to the house. As far as Michelle goes, she did some foolish things herself to protect her kids. This book is a riot, so hang in there through the first few chapters, and you'll find yourself in the middle of a great read!To the reader from Australia- Here are some great books to try !Handyman by Linda NicholsPlainsong by Ken HarufBittersweet Rain by Sandra BrownAnd, of course, anything from Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel!"
4,Good!,"I liked the book. It is not quite as good as The Bestseller or The Ex Wives Club, but a lot better than Marrying Mom! It is a revenge novel and the basic idea is pretty much like The Ex Wives Club, but darker and more sinister. More realistic also - the women are normal women, not New York socialites. I liked the scene when the heroines view a video tape of ""The Ex Wives Club"" film and decide that they, too, can take revenge on their husbands!"
4,"In the end, they all get what they deserve....","Starts off as a slow read (which is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars), laying out three lives that for the most part seem norm. As layer after layer is told, the three women in this book lives start to unravel. The story unfolded to the point of where I found myself not being able to put the book down. The paybacks on their former men go from simply funny, to extreme revenge. In the end, their former men get exactly what they deserve. Sorry for not giving too much away, however I thing this is a fantastic chick read!"
3,"revenge ok, setup phony","The revenge part of this book is fun, but the setup for it is totally phony, especially the courtroom scenes. This book had the greatest number of typographical and other errors I have ever encountered in a novel, especially by a well-known author."
3,For Man-Hater's Everywhere,"I like Olivia Goldsmith. I have read several of her books and enjoyed them. They're not literature, but they're usually funny and diverting. She did the revenge thing in the ""First Wives Club"" book. That book was funny in a wickedly, cartoonish way. This one is not. This one resurrects the same plot and then adds a cynical, hard-edged extra-dose of unfettered hatred against men. The irony, of course, is that each of her characters neatly lines up a newer man to share her life at the same time she is revenging and dumping the first man who done her wrong in the first place. What drivel...can't live with 'em, obviously Olivia can't live without 'em either. Oh, except if one becomes a lesbian. Silly. I might have forgiven the plot if the women were more accountable for the choices they made in the first place. They're all innocent victims. Baloney. I note there are 7 copies of this available used in the dollar range. Don't waste your money."
4,A GOOD READ,"I read this book from start to finish. It is a story about 3 women who are married to immature, unstable husbands. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a good book not great and it could have been a little shorter. Some parts were a little boring but I like this lady's style of writing and this is the first book that I read by her and I liked the story."
3,Young (First) Wives (Club),"I've heard of plots being reused, but this is ridiculous! This novel is virtually the 'First Wives Club' disguised as three of the most gullible women I have ever read about. All of the husbands are snakes and you just wish you could kick Angela, Michelle, and Jada for falling for their 'poor me' acts. When the three women come together, they form an alliance to rival Charlie's Angels. They do their detective work and come up with hilarious ways to do their exes in. The Super Glue incident is a work of art in itself. That and the fact that these women finally stand up for themselves is the reason I give this book 3 stars. One really annoying thing about this book is the acronyms that Jada uses throughout (LUMPS=Lying, Ugly Male Pigs, NUP=Natural Unit Preferences)...I had to keep going back to find out what they meant because she uses so many of them it gets confusing. Otherwise, this book is OK, just a rehashing of an already successful story."
2,Disappointed,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I'd read such good reviews of Olivia Goldsmith that I was expecting a really funny book. This book is about men that are the lowest of the low and the women who love them. I found the female characters to be fairly stupid and the male characters to be dispicable. This might be a fun read if you'd recently been with a guy who has done something horrible to you, but if you're not a man hater at the moment, you'll probably be unhappy with this choice."
3,Emmanuel Ax Chopin Concerto No 1 and Variations on La Ci Darem,"My main gripe with this CD is that Track 5 starts not at the beginning of the Variations on La Ci Darem La Mano, but halfway through. It's definitely a fault, but I don't know whther it just affects my CD or all CDs of this particular recording. I considered returning it, but would miss it too much, so I have to put up with the inconvenience of listening to the rather soporific rendition of Walz No 3 if I want to catch the beginning of the Variations. This beginning, is actually a bit of a snore itself, but then Ax gets going to produce some fireworks towards the end. On balance, I consider Nikolai Demidenko's performance of these Variations (without orchestral accompani,ment) to be far superior to Ax's.Another ""gripe"" is that the abovementioned Walz No 3 (or Op 34 No 2, to be precise) is erroneously called ""Grand Valse Brillante"" on the cover!"
2,Beware!,"I heard Emanuel Ax play the Chopin Concerto No. 1 in concert. It was stunning. I immediately bought this CD, hoping it would replicate the experience. I was dismayed that not only did this historic piano sound honky-tonk and tinny, but the high registers were out of tune as well. I didn't make it through an entire listening of the CD - it was simply too painful! I'm scared to give it another chance. I would NOT recommend this recording to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy the beauty of Chopin!!"
4,SUPER NATURAL FAIRY TALES,"Before Spooky tooth you had art, a 4 piece british psych group. Who released only one lp back in 1967.This cd collection features the original tracks,plus original art work,plus a brief history of the group with a photograph.The songs featured are a mixed bag, slow and fast and all sung by Mike Harrison whos voice is very suited to the songs.My two favourite tracks are, I think I am going weird,and super natural fairy tale which are both fast and very psychedelic.Buy as a prequel to Spooky tooth."
4,pre -spooky tooth,"this is spooky tooth without gary wright and comes from 1967, before spooky tooth was even formed, its not all that reminiscent of the later group. i'd really give this about a 3.25 rating if that was offered, but i always try to be generous in these reviews and nonprofessional- its not like we're all real reviewers for a magazine or something! supernatural fairy tales is a fine song, and some of the other cuts are pretty good too. this has some psychedelia, hard rock, soul and pop on it , plus some fine drumming during african thing and decent covers of buffalo sprinfield and the rascals. i read an interview once in which geezer butler of black sabbath said that art was a big influence on his band, and that is very apparent on the track i think i'm going weird, it sounds a lot like black sabbath. overall, this is hardly a great disc, but it does contain a few great tracks"
4,"Obscured by Beatles, Floyd, Doors, Velvets...","It must have been very hard to compete with ""Sgt. Pepper's"", ""Piper"", Doors's 1st album, ""VU & Nico"" and others. These records were all released in the magic year of 1967, just like ""Supernatural Fairy Tales"". The band was very, very psychedelic, but with a soul flavour. Hidden gems of psychedelia are presented here: the poignant ballad ""Flying Anchors"", the mad ""Alive Not Dead"", the exotic ""African Thing"" and the pure rock'n'roll ""What's That Sound (For What Is Worth)"". If you're a psych collector, you definitively MUST HAVE this one."
5,Great Recording,"I first heard the ""Old Medley"" on Pandora and was impressed with the old Genesis material. Just bought it for that song plus ""Home By The Sea"" and the dual drum solos. Excellent recording and well worth the $10 price."
3,A great deception,"What the hell is going on in the old medley...It start great with ""Dance on a volcano"" it is amazing in the ""Firth of Fifth"" extract and it finish with...""Follow you follow me and That's all"" which totally ruins the whole medley. A real deception here. Next you have the best of Invisible touch (Domino), the best of We can't dance (Driving the last spike and Fading light) and the best of the ""Genesis"" album, which is Home by the sea-Seond home by the sea. Conclusion, not enought space for old stuff, and the only place it had is ruined by extracts of some songs that should have been on ""The shorts"""
2,sadly mediocre,"It's such a shame that Genesis went commercial, not that it was all terrible, but that they never challenged their musical abilities once they did. Sure, the recording is great, but the songs get stale quickly, as the band makes no effort to do anything different than the album versions. The ending of the old medley is abominable, as phil tries to spurt out as many song choruses as he can in a terrible butchering. The best moment is the mid-section of Firth of Fifth, showing how elaborate their songs can be, but it also shows how fabulous guitarist Daryl Stuermer is criminally underused, playing bass while the terrible lead of Mike Rutherford wanders around. Firth of Fifth is Daryl's only chance to perform to his capabilities, and the same is true of the whole band. Hearing this fine moment followed by the dullness of the rest of the cd illustrates just how far this once proud band has fallen."
4,This Album,"This album is the second best live Genesis album and should be gotten in leu of the albums most of its songs are on, Invisible Touch, Genesis, We Cant Dance. Clearly The Longs captures the best material from that whole period, the creative Prog Rockers and not the pop garbage. The only drawback is the weak Old Medley, the songs that the band touch on from the Gabrial era are much better handled by Gabrial singing then Phil but the rest of the albums great especially the drum duet which closes the album."
4,Not fossilized yet,"The longs album is a much better idea, to me, than the shorts one. Not that I don't also love 'Invisible Touch,' etc., but those songs I feel are much better appreciated in the studio. These particular songs are better appreciated in a live context. ""Fading Lights"" and ""Home By the Sea"" are highlights, as well as parts of the 'Old Medley.'Actually, some parts of the 'Medley' are strangly boring, exemplified by my friend's comment during Musical Box: ""hey, didn't this song used to rock?"" Some other parts are very enjoyable, though, especially Firth of Fifth.Definitely not by any means essential, but still 70+ minutes of music performed by the last true version of a great band."
3,Too Long,"When these two live album came out I bought them together, because they went together, and because they were limited edition live albums, the Shorts and Longs the are called and while the Shorts turned out to be a good live album and song friendly, the Longs didn't have enough on it to excite me. The Shorts had live versions of songs like ""Invisible Touch"" and a very good version of ""Land Of Confusion"", while the Longs had nothing with the exception of ""Domino"" which was too long and ""Fading Lights"" which is probably the best on this album. I believe they tried releasing ""Home By Sea"" but didn't work, if I were picking which one to buy it would be the Shorts."
2,not so great,"this are branded SPL by Power Acoustic, so it's like a cheap class. They don't sound as great as a power acoustic should. They cannot handle too much power, they sound like they're gonna blast.If I only knew they could handle more power than a radio has, I would have never bought them"
5,Excellent guide to make a system program,"When you write some codes involved system features, you could get a good key or hint from this book.This book is explainning about the system architecture of Windows, how to block the shared resource(synchronization), the futher usage of Win32 APIs.If you are makinig the program handles a globally shared data like real-time stock data or cache mechnism, or if you are making the application is working with some other process, you will realize the true value of this book.And this book is providing a good hint for the performance improvement.But this book is not for the network feature, GUI related feature, Database, the APIs for handle file (descriptor level) which were handled in the same book in third edition ""Advanced Windows"", and the genuine computting logics.(The file handling APIs are explained in ""Programming Server-Side Applications for Windows 2000"" of the same author.)This book could be called ""A Excellent Practical Windows Programming Guide""."
3,Good topics but C++ Should Not Be Used,I am a kernel debugger. Richter's last volume was written in C. This makes sense because most of what he covers is OS/kernel based where C is still used today 99% of the time. This book uses C++ and objects. Most device drivers or OS system apps would not be written in C++. I know very little C++ because I spend 100% of my time reading C code. Why Richter introduces C++ objects and classes is beyond me. I prefer the prior volume. If people start writing low level system code in C++ Windows will be even more buggy. I own about 20 UNIX internals books similar to this one and everyone use C.
5,Flee the Darkness,"Having read all the ""Left Behind"" series up to the most recent one (""Assassins""), I did not expect to find another book that would challenge the amount of enjoyment and encouragement that I received from that series. Much to my delight and pleasure, this book far surpassed that series. It is extremely well written and much more entertaining than any of the ""Left Behind"" series. I am presently reading the sequel, ""By Dawn's Early Light"" and find that, it too, is an excellent book. These books are definitely written for believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and who are eagerly awaiting his return. If you enjoyed LaHaye and Jenkins books, you will most certainly enjoy this book."
3,"Decent, but far from great","Flee The Darkness is not a bad novel, but that's about as far as it goes. If, like me, you have a taste for Christian Endtime fiction, you'll probably enjoy this novel. There's nothing wrong with it but, like many other novels in this genre, there's nothing standout about it either. If you're interested in reading a truly exceptional novel about Revelations, I would suggest We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell. Caldwell uses Revelations, not just to imagine what it might be like, but to truly explore the nature of God an mankind. I read the novel three months ago, and I'm still thinking about it, God and myself. Flee is a good novel, it just doesn't come anywhere close to We All Fall Down."
2,It's ok if you're NOT looking for fun stuff.,"I bought this thinking it was going to have behind the scenes cuts or such. The whole thing is just not about Lucy. And is not fun to watch either. Most of the videos have long programs where Lucy, Desi, Vivian & Bill appear very slightly, the only one I remember they appear for the longest time is the Ed Sullivan show. The part where Lucy is awarded is nice to watch once or twice but not all the time. I mean I was expecting to see the part where she was in the program ""what's my line"". I expected cuts of all her TV appearances. There's no description for it here at Amazon so you don't have a clue of what you're getting. Although I bought it in a store and the description on the box is not good either. It doesn't tell you, you have to watch for hours and you're only going to see Lucy & Desi for only about 1/2 hour throughout the videos."
1,Doesnt fit 2005 Escalade,"I ordered this in June of 2010, They arrived and I forgot all about them till a few days ago. I decide to install them, little do I know that these are wayyy to short and will NOT work for a 2005 Escalade.Of course my return window is expired so im stuff with useless plug wires."
1,"They were labeled for a certaint truck, But did not fit!",ordered these wires OVERNIGHT for a 2005 cadillac escalade 6.0l v8 but they were for a different vehicle and did not fit. so they have something screwed up in there system.
4,Fahey Plus,"When I was in art school about half a million years ago, there used to be a saying, ""less is more."" In this case I'm tempted to say ""more is less"" -- except that the Fahey adjuncts do such a great job adding joy and life and fine musicianship to the sessions. However... to tell the truth, I'd rather just hear Fahey, or just Fahey and the other guitarist. The dixieland band, although first rate, drowns out Fahey and makes the CD sound almost like excerpts from two different CDs (which it is not). What gives it consistency is the overall mood, which is very enjoyable and not as dark as some of Fahey's playing can be -- which as a diehard Fahey fan I like alot, too."
2,Way Over-priced,"This is the only product I have purchased thru Amazon that I felt was a complete rip-off. A ""tiny"" sponge for a lot of $$ and instead of mailing it in a #10 envelope for 44 cents they sent it for $1.99!I wrote to them and only got back that they were sorry for the inconvenience. How silly is that sentence?Buyer beware on this ""sponge"" and company."
5,This book has kept me out of a job!!!!!,"Need I say more? It's been over a year now and i couldn't be happier. Ditch McDonald's, the Army, the Marines, your parents, the world. Go live on Tonga, write, nude, on your laptop and never come back! You can do it!'Nuff said."
3,not what i was looking for,"i've taken writing classes before,,, excellent, so i thought this book would teach me what i could get in a writing school without having to shell out the big bucks.. wrong!this author's audience is basically people who want to publish material without knowing how to write properly, i would like to be happy with my writing before i publish it.a lot of the book it seemed like he gave useless information, such as information about his life, if i wanted to know, i would have picked up his autobiography.Anyway he does offer some tips, but thats all they are, TIPS, i'll give him credit on a great title but not at all representative on what you will find inside the book."
4,A great overview of making a living at writing,"Takes you step by step through what it /really/ takes to be able to make a living at writing, unlike some other wtiting books I've read. I've already got 2 books started and well on thier way. Thank You Mr. Dean"
5,More Great Tips from Michael Dean...,"If you've ever heard Michael Dean speak, then you know you are getting the real deal in his book.$30 Writing School was very informative - I even picked up a couple of English language tips. I have been trying to write a book for some time now. Dean's book gave me some excellent ideas, tips and, most importantly, MOTIVATION!!!Thank you, Michael Dean!"
3,For 5th Grade Writers,"This book was a waste. If the author cut out the nonsense and got to the point, it'd be about 50 pages. I bought the book based on the reviews here....and WHY???? Listen, if you can operate Microsoft Word, you don't need this book. $30 worth of kindling for the fire is about all this is coughed up to be. I mean come on, do we really even need to know that you were lovers with one of your marketing contacts??? The entire book is written with foolishness and low class language. I expected much more professionalism from a so-called professional."
3,Outdoor speakers,Speakers sound good to be outdoors. Only problem was the mounting threads the you put your screws into. I had one push in to where I couldn't put my screw into to mount it. I was able to make something work.
1,Pyle PDWR33,"The speakers sound very good for the price, but it took awhile after purchasing the pair to install them. The mounting decorator screws were missing from the box! I couldn't mount the speakers to the wall. It took 2 weeks for their parts dept. in New York to send them to me. They also did not send the correct matching color. They only had light beige decorator screws in stock and not white. Very poor quality control."
5,Brilliant,"This CD is brilliant.Transcriptions for piano of Wagner excerpts, by a variety of composers (not just Liszt).The descending runs added to the Pilgrim's chorus in the Tannhaueser overture are quite remarkable: Liszt really managed to get a lot of detail into his transcriptions.The other transcriptions work very well too.The sound quality is excellent. Wonderful clarity and depth."
2,Not Up To Goldin Snuff,"If this collection of Goldin photographs demonstrates anything, it is fine wine, great paintings, loving relationships, and fine art education do not necessarily inspire, guarantee, or, in themselves, produce extraordinary photography. Whatever her experience might have been in Japan while making these photographs, the resulting images are, at the very most, photo album, vacation snap shots holding very little in substance and meaning to anyone except Nan Goldin. Goldin's effort here is one of self absorption which most artists bathe in on occasion. While the images in this edition, as boring and lacking in any form of specific or universal meaning as they are, can be 'blamed' on Goldin, the editorial decision to publish this book prove publishers continue to be a steady source for the 'bargain book' shelves at bookstores everywhere."
1,A DUMB PHOTO BOOK OF ORDINARY JAPANESE PEOPLE,Just an ordinary collection of young Japanese people in face or body shots wearing ordinary everyday street clothes. Very few nude or provocative shots. Was this someone's first intermediate school photo project? I am going to delete Nan Goldin's name from my hard drive.
3,Not Lacking in Ego,"In his autobiography, THE MAGIC LANTERN, Ingmar Bergman makes it clear that he is the most important person in his world. Bergman dismisses certain wives in a paragraph, much less marginally talented actors. He hates his pastor father and the God of the Bible, and seems to indict his mother for not having the nerve to leave what he considers a hapless marriage. And yet, his fame largely rests with the religiously oriented films that he made from The Seventh Seal through The Silence.As a person, Bergman recognizes his hedonistic ways and dominating personality. Very few sections do not have some comment where he realizes that he was impossible to live with and completely self-absorbed. But, he also gives the impression that he is a self-absorbed genius when it comes to film. He may be right in that regard, but watching his films is markedly more fun than reading his book."
5,Fun product / Great carrier,"Fun product, comes with a great carrier and storage case. Really reasonable price. This is a great item for entertaining as you can give each guest a personal salt and pepper shaker. Often these do not come with the case which is great for storage and management."
4,Cute little thing!,"I had been wanting a set of these mini salt and pepper shakers for a long time. While they aren't of the highest quality, they will work fine for the little bit of entertaining I do. It's not like we would use them every day."
3,Individual salt & pepper shakers,"I would have liked for the salt & pepper shakers to have been a little larger. My dining room table is very long and they served my purpose. Even though they are smaller than I had expected, it was nice for each guest to have their own and not have to ask, will you pass the salt and pepper. This item was received as promised by Amazon."
4,Unique Table Setting Accessory,"I purchased these after I saw them at a friend's house. The lids are silver colored and the shakers come with a metal tray, which is great for storage. My first package came completely broken. After calling the company, they immediately sent me another set. I used the shakers with my china for my first Thanksgiving dinner and my guests loved them! I am thinking about getting some as Christmas presents."
4,Perfect for Parties,Perfect for parties. I would have rated it a 5 but inadequate packing forced me to have to wait for replacement pieces. They came quickly and without mishap.
4,Great individual salt & pepper shakers.,The salt and pepper shakers were perfect for individual place settings. I have a small funnel so they were easy to fill. The metal carrier that comes with the shakers is very nice. Two of the bottles were broken on delivery.
4,Very good summary of Traditional Chinese Medicine,This book provides a good overview of the foundations of traditional Chinese medicine and how it differs from Western medicine. A good place to start if you're trying to gain some perspective and/or an entry into alternative medicine and healing. Western trained physicians can benefit tremendously by understanding a completely different approach to healing. Highly recommended.
2,Hmmmmmm,"I consider myself a fairly literate reader, but I don't get this book. The fundemental flaw of this book is that there are way too many characters for so short a book, and worse we are forced to rotate through a new point of view with each chapter. That might be interesting as an intellectual excercise, but as a practical matter it is confusing and distances the reader from the characters. There are some great moments, and some great imagery in this book, but overall it just didn't work for me."
1,Stinkfest,"I don't know how anyone could rate this book as 5 stars. There is no story or plot, but a series of incidents, unexplained, that happen to a group of undeveloped characters. There is no tension because there is no story or character development. Since the events are entirely unexplained, there is no reason to read this book. I cannot recommend this to anyone other than collectors of poorly written trash. Oh, and both an editor and a copywritter would have been helpful...they couldn't have turned this pig's ear into a silk purse, but it would have been slighlty less painful.Oh, and one side note: The praise above for the author (not reader reviews, the critics reviews) is not for this book, but for a different book. I'm surprised that Amazon does this as it could mislead you into thinking there had been positive critical reviews for this book, when there haven't been."
2,"tedium, not terror","Campbell has masterfully imported the tedium of corporate America, with its fake cheerfulness and its ruthless struggles for power. What's missing in all this is any sense of terror; most of us know this world too well to find it frightening, and Campbell doesn't give us the kind of pathology of place that makes, for instance, Shirley Jackson's sour spots -- especially Hill House -- so enthralling. As for the plot, skip any fifty pages after the first and see if it makes much difference."
2,Not very good,i have to disagree with the previous review of this book. i think Mr.Campbell is a great writer but i think this is one of the worst horror novel's he has ever written. the story centers around a book store obviously. apparently the store is haunted or some such it is never very clear what is going on.what happens through most of the book is the store's employee's bicker back and forth and there is always fog surrounding the building. apparently there are grey blobs that also play a part here too but i am not too sure what. this is literally what happens throughout the book. grey blobs run around the shelf pulling books down. the lift is probably the scariest thing in this book.don't get me wring there are some generally creepy moments in this book but they are few and far between. the story line is never really explained either except for a pitiful ending that tries to wrap everything up and make sense of it all. the book is just not very good...
1,I give up!,"I have been trying to get through this book since the day it came out and I give! UNCLE! Boring does not even begin to describe this dreadful piece of schlock...I normally read 3 or 4 books a month and really looked forward to this one, but I have had to break my cardinal rule and just skip from page 160 to the end. And the ending...big disappointment! I'm just glad I saved myself from reading the other pages in between or I'd really have felt cheated.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..."
4,Campbell always leaves me wanting more...in a good way!,"Ramsey Campbell is one of the most talented horror writers out there, hands down. Other novels of his I've read are 'The Darkest Park of the Woods' and 'The Long Lost', both of which left me wanting more - more information, more pages, more details. Campbell is the best of the 'show, don't tell' talents, but I always feel a little frustrated that he didn't show quite enough. For instance (and trying not to give anything away here), I would like to have learned more about the historical events whose residue were the basis of the trouble at the bookstore. There's never quite enough of that kind of detail, and I'm sure it's deliberate rather than an oversight (no way could a man this brilliant overlook anything) - a way to show the horror purely from the sufferers' perspective. Well done, but I'd still like the details, you know? Recommended."
1,Abyssmal,I'm really trying to finish this book simply because it's not so engrossing that I'd ever miss my stop on mny daily commute. There is nothing scary about this book besides the day-to-day horror of working in a bookstore (of which I can speak first-hand). It drags so much you wish something awful would hurry up and happen just so you don't have to deal with such boring characters and lack of storyline any longer.
5,"Great product, hard to find in local stores though",This is a nice pack for those of us with the Canon mini printer. I purchased from Amazon because I haven't had any luck finding these in local stores. Provides plenty of prints and the quality is excellent.
2,What a pity!,"Robertson's Marmalades WERE superb. Their ""chunky"" and ""original"" were both best of all marmalades made anywhere. Unfortunately the only one the new owners chose to save of Robertson's many types is the insipid ""Golden Shred"", not worth bothering the effort."
1,silly and unoriginal,"The title says it all. This is another typical ghost story in which a wealthy dead guy gathers together a bunch of strangers to his isolated, creepy old mansion. Ghosts appear, people get picked off, and then the evil ghost is defeated. One of the ghosts has a chopped off hand that crawls around and attacks people ala Thing in the Addams Family. If that were not ridiculous enough, the main ghost inhabits a statue carved out of wood and stumbles around like Frankenstein's monster carrying his head. The final straw is that the good guys are annoying and just not likeable. There is no vivid and mind capturing description of the mansion or its history. There is no sense of mystery or suspense. This book is just bad and I want my money back."
2,Scary...not so much,This was the first Nicholson Book I have read. I loved the setting and was ready for a good scare BUT it never really got there. The folk magic was fun.Over all it was just ok.I would be willing to try another of his books.
5,Good on so many different levels,"A sucker for horror I say I'll read anything and sadly have, but sometimes you run across an author and a book that justifies all the bad flesh eating overdone stuff that is out there. Scott Nicholson on the whole is always a guaranteed great read, its literary horror (Yes that DOES exist) and in The Manor he has created a hell of a book, with a glimpse of some hellish goings on as well. An artists and writers colony with every luxury but 21st century amenities. Of course its haunted, and cursed and populated by some of the most disturbing living personalities in fiction. From first to last, this is just a finely written terrifying novel and proves that Scott Nicholson is a consistent guaranteed great read."
2,Where's the Scare?,"Thought I would try a new author, and was very disappointed...a lot of build up to nothing...would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want to read something to keep you awake at night, try THE DEVIL IN GRAY by Grahamn Masterson or ETERNITY by Tamara Thorne. Great reads!"
1,My 1.5F capacitor was more like .4F,"It is pretty easy to measure how much energy is stored in a capacitior. Use the following equiation V=I*T/C. Since my PowerAcustik capacitor draws about .1A to run the display, all you need to do to check the capacitance is see how long it takes the voltage to drop once you disconnect it from the source of power. For example, in my case it took about 4 seconds for the voltage to drop from 13.5 down to 12.5. Rearranging the equation and solving for C....I come up with about .4F. Fortunaetly, .4F is still probably good enough to ride out one thump of the car stereo...so it propably doesn't matter at the end of the day...but I still want to get what I am paying for. F. H. (Rick) Smith"
4,look for version 6 now out,"Excellent software, very stable. Version 6 is now out, on the +DVD side, it's now version 3. The newer version fixes my only quibble with the software, it adds support for project playlists so you can put your video on the DVD and do scene selection menus without copying it on again."
5,"Intriguing, descriptive, and elaborate",Very nice book. Pages are all colorfully illustrated and well written. Focuses on every point of Ramesses's life possible. Very informative and would recommend to anyone who is a Egypt enthusiast or for reference.
4,Miraculous Images,"Dr Michael was my professor at Christie's Education in London, and believe me, he knows his stuff. The windows at Canterbury are incredibly beautiful and the photographs in the book are all top-notch. If you're a fan of stained glass and/or medieval English art, this is the book for you."
3,Hard-going,"I found the text of this book rather hard-going; it requires quite some concentration to read. No doubt the content of the book is very good, but it's too hard for me to read to really be able to say."
3,Not happy,"The book itself is OK I guess but I haven't read very far into it as it is a marked up and underlined copy, and as I recall, it was listed as a clean copy. Some people enjoy reading previous readers' comments. I don't."
2,Too Much Talk,"I was really motivated to change my housekeeping habits when I bought this book, but by the time I got to chapter 12 where they actually teach you some techniques I lost interest.I agree with a previous reviewer that there is too much ""why"" and not enough ""how"". It analyzes too much about what makes us messies tick, and only about half the book gets into strategies for changing your habits. I think that if you are buying this book you already KNOW you have issues, just get to the point already!"
4,music could last longer,"It is very lovely. I do enjoy the beauty of it, but for $40, it could play music longer than it does which I would say plays for about 3 minutes. I would like to see it be able to wind-up up to 10 minutes of musical play."
4,Beautiful!,"I love the mobile and so does my daughter. She can stare and coo at it for hours. She gets so excited to see me coming to turn it on. I will have to agree with another reviewer though, I wish the music would last longer. Other than that, it matches the entire Paloma decor beautifully and is a must have."
4,"great product, but not ""new crib"" friendly.","I got this as a baby gift and it is so beautiful and cute. It goes great with the bedding set! My only concern is that we have a fancy sleigh crib that has a ""headboard looking"" back part to it. It is one that converts later on. Well the mobile does not fit in the back of the crib so we had to put it on the front. I hate looking at that large plastic thing sticking out of the front of my crib. I wish they would make it more versitile for all the newer crib styles. My daughter is not born yet (3 more weeks) but I think I might have to remove it sooner than most because it is in the front of the crib and can posssibly get in the way when putting her down to sleep. I can't wait to try it though."
2,Beautiful but can not mount on the wall,"This item is truly beautiful as other reviewers have said, however, it lacks one very important thing. Unlike several other mobiles it can not be mounted on the wall once baby starts to pull-up in the crib. My daughter is so unhappy because we had to take it out of her crib."
5,A good practical book,"Pipeline transportation of liquids (even solids for that matter) has assumed unprecedented importance today owing to the increase in volumes of transport and distances along with inflation and escalating costs. An easy to refer document that helps pipeline transportation industry is desirable and the ""Liquid Pipeline Hydraulics"" book serves this purpose. Fluid mechanics for a field engineer is what Mr. Menon has provided in this book with examples to help field applications. I hope pipeline engineers, particularly in the field will find this book a valuable addition to their reference folder."
2,for die hard Bodett fans,"It was good to hear the piano music of JohnnyB again; it was good (as always) to hear Tom's voice. But...The story is taken from Tom's life. The particular episode involves climbing a power pole, being electrocuted (surprise!),and almost losing an arm.The story lacks the tale teller's humor of ""The End of the Road"" and is a bit self serving at times.If you are one of those people (like me) that reads EVERYTHING an author has ever done, then this is one for the collection. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,white noise,If you think really hard it sounds like surf but this is basically white noise without the thought process. Maybe the heavy thinking is what puts you to sleep.
4,Very Timely,Excellent read for those serious about understanding what has happened to our culture and how it will take a miracle to turn it around again.
1,Fun to read but is it worth the price?,"The worth of this book depends a lot on your needs. If you are looking into pinhole photography as something novel and aren't really serious about it, this is a fun book to read. However, if you are really interested in pinhole photography as an art form, there are better books on which to spend your money. You make the call. I sold my copy and bought Eric Renner's book."
3,Errors and Omissions,"My professor says this is the best around, but please be aware there are many errors in the plates and figures. Also, the online supplementary content is out-of-date--it refers to an earlier edition. Nor does it have the answers to all the review questions. If you buy this book used, you will have to buy a new keycode (available online) for $5.95 to access the online content."
3,Good but....,This is a good book and gets the points across very well. The content is very good however the cost of the book doesn't seem right. If this book was cheaper i would have given it 4 stars...so if you can get it cheaper used then do that. Its a good book with great content and covers the material well. If you have to buy it..then BUY IT USED
5,Very Good service all around,"This text was in very good shape, delivered well within reason, and all around very pleased with the service.Thanks,John M."
1,I can honestly say that I learned nothing from this book,Completely abstract without concrete examples. Full of verbiage. Impossible to grasp.I hated this book from day 1 and it was a waste of time. I wouldn't even know what to suggest for alternatives.
2,Not a good book!,"The book is extremely boring. I am using it in a class, so there is no choice of textbook. The book has a number of typos/errors and is often hard to follow. Look for a better one because this text is very far from the best. Pages don't have chapter number written on them, which is just another inconvenience."
1,Not for beginners...,I am taking a database class and this book is of very little help much like the teacher.
3,"Great Book, unless you got the Interntional Edition!!","Great text book, but like all students I was looking for the cheapest price tag. I got the international edition for half the price, however, I discovered that it was missing pages, though the cover claims that it has the exact same content as US Edition. It is also missing a CD. The US Edition comes with 2 CD's including the SQL Server CD, which the international edition doesn't come with.Unless you have a friend from whom you can copy the missing pages, hopefully if you discovered them early enough before an exam or homework, and the CD, you're better off paying the $120+ price tag for a US edition."
4,"Excellent contents, however, too much strain on the eyes.",The book covers all relevant topics in the database processing and management area. It is a good read if you know the subject area well. I found it too stressful for the eyes as the writing is so small.
5,great amp,"I dont actually have the a3000db, I have the A2400db. I have been using this amp for at least 2 years. Have had no problems. Pushes lots of power. If you are looking for an amp to push lots of power and are willing to sacrafice a little bit of sound quality, this is probably the best bang for the buck. At 1 ohm, ( yes they are 1 ohm stable ) the 2400 will push 1800 rms. Dont be fooled by the simple plain look. this amp is no PUNK! You will need either a cap or an alternator upgrade, or get a yellow top optima. Draws lots of current.Pros: cheap, powerfull, 1 ohm stable, digital circuitry, conservative,bridging sycronization( means you can hook two of these together and push twice the power with master and slave switches), very low response(15HZ-150Hz),Cons: dsitortion level high (0.5% THD)"
1,Never Received...,Obviously I can't review it since I never received it. I did however get a full refund so no complaints here.
1,101 Projects for your Corvette,"Book has many great ideas, but is lacking specific details. For instance: you can replace your weather stripping however there are no details as to how to do it."
2,Disappointed with the projects listed in the book,"The projects listed in this book could be found in any service manual. And a true service manual would have done a better, more professional job describing the required step to complete the task. I expected 101 unique projects not a book of normal routine maintanence items"
3,OK Book,This book is a bit aged but makes for some good reading. Not a substitute for the factory manual for these cars.
3,The most realisitic view of any car book out there,"This book gives you a good view of what you can do to the C4. It deals with the cars small issues, and gives you a good idea where to go and what to expect. It explains how hard it is to improve on GMs design here, as for suspention its tuff to out due it. But it spends little time on imporatant things like heads, cams, and intakes. More it spends much of the time talking about how the aftermarket is shadey, and what you can't improve on. So its info is great, but its drab. The author is just trying to get the truth across, but there still very little to excite you about. So if you own a C4, this is a good book for info but nothing else. And much of it I already knew. So for me this book was kind of worth it, but I could have lived without it."
5,One of Benedetti greatest stories,"La vecina orilla it's one of the greatest short stories I've ever read. Wonderful, amazing as everything that comes from Benedetti's mind!"
5,magic,the only songs u dont want to listen to is sky pup and the final 2 songseverything is awesome. you can tell from this album how much kurt cobain and nirvana took from the melvins.
3,Yee-ouch,"Sludgy, trudgy, sledgehammer slab of thud and ugh. Unique because its the only record I own where song lyrics are crafted from gibberish. You have records where you cant understand the lyrics because the music is too loud or the vocal style obfuscates the context...then you have this, a deconstructive dada attempt to not so much marginalize the value of a vocal, but rather marginalize meaning. Too high concept, or just stupid? Either way, musically, this is one of the heaviest things Ive bought. Has a Kiss cover, ""Goin' Blind"",if that sways your decision to purchase."
1,Cleverly disappearing talent,"1 1/2A bloated lightweight, pseudo-heavy, post-punk over-citation disguises its compositional inadequacies inside undercooked experimentation and wins due to such low relative expectation."
1,stupid,Can someone please tell me why people compare this to my favorite band Nivarna? Sometime's it's really fast like hardcore death metal like Slipknot and sometimes it's really slow like they got tired. what!!! make up your mind please. I guess it's funny when he's singing about goats but this isn't nearly as good as Nivarna.
5,Awesome album from the Melvins,"The Melvins are one of the greatest bands of all time. This is probably my favorite Melvins record. It's got sludge, it's got punk, it's got grunge... A varied range of styles. Favorite songs: Night Goat, Hooch, Honey Bucket, Copache, Set Me StraightNote: To you Nirvana fans skeptical to checking out the Melvins (Which is doubtful, considering Kurt loved these guys), he plays guitar on track 8."
5,Great Record,"There's already been enough reviews on how incredible this album is, so I'll leave it at that and rate it."
2,Battery Charger,I have used the charger numerous times and really liked it until the fan started making noises and then completely quit. I would not recommend.
1,Unreliable!!,"I really liked this charger but after having had 6 of these chargers now, it's over. They have all failed within a year. I have had failures of mostly fans but also push buttons & the display. Another just totally failed due to a safety feature lockout. Bummer!!!"
2,Bad Cooling Fan,"This unit has a very high failure rate. They are very good at replacing the failed unit but the replacement units also quickly fails even with light useage.I have had several fan failures and a control button failure. Otherwise, this is a great charger. It will put out full current as specified, except when the fan fails."
2,Good Charger For Autos,"This is a very good charger for automotive use, however I bought it because I wanted it for the purpose of charging smaller batteries like the ones used on motorcycles and riding lawnmowers. This charger will not work in that application. I was told by a person at Black and Decker that I need model VEC 1086A or VEC 1089A."
2,not authentic,"The one I received was not authentic so it would not stay on correctly (and I managed to get my full refund). I later bought another one from else where and it stays on and reads sto-fen on it. That said this one that does not stay on correctly, I was still able to use it but have to really work with it to get it correctly positioned. For that this imitation sto-fen gets 2 points. the real sto-fen, I would give a 5 as it definitely does what it is supposed to do and does not give a harsh shadow."
1,Sto-Fen SB5 for Nikon D300,"Do not purchase the Sto-Fen SB5 for the Nikon Speedflash, it does not fit properly like the factory model. THe Sto-Fen SB5 may scratch the sides of your speedflash trying to install and uninstall the diffuser. Also new Nikon Speedflash should include a new Omni-Bouce Diffuser."
4,Sto-Fen OMSB5 Omni-Bounce Diffuser review,It works fine and you can get great colors of your photos. The photo will have a smooth definition a brilliant colors. First you can take some pictures and adjust the flash for proper illumination and there you have it.
2,"Ok, I guess","This diffuser came nowhere near meeting my expectations. First, although it fits on the Pentax 540 flash, it doesn't exactly fit well. The flash has a rounded edge at the top and the Sto-Fen is straight edged, so it never really fully seats. This is more a cosmetic issue than functional, so I did some testing. The diffuser performed almost exactly as well as the internal diffuser on the flash (which we already own). I couldn't tell the photos apart. Bouncing the flash with the Sto-Fen diffuser created underexposed shots. The only situation where I would get ANY benefit from this device is if I were extremely close to the subject, I didn't want to point the flash directly at the subject, and I was in a location where I could not bounce a flash off a ceiling (like outdoors or some place with cathedral ceilings). So in other words, this product is more or less useless for me."
5,Great Insight,This book was written after numerous interviews with convicted rapists all over the country. It gives you a great insight into the way they see themselves and their situations instead of just getting the clicnical diagnose or the impression of the author. You get that too but the real core of this book is the insight into the mind and actions of these offenders.
1,Money maker,"Could we say that this woman is a consumer-savvy genius or just another greedy clever marketeer? She is making a mint with tips on how to pet your cat or dog, something most pet lovers have been doing since childhood. As an example of her pet massage tips, she appeared on Dave Letterman calling the sample cat ""henry benry."""
2,watch out,"This is the first time I am trying to write review since I hope one one will follow my mistake. This DVD does NOT have picture for almost all of the songs (only one song have movie to go with it). All it has is the lyrics showing on screen while the song is singing. It claims this feature will ""help kids learn spelling"". I find it is much less fun to play with and I do not like it at all. If you like this feature, then buy it. Otherwise, please do not."
4,"Well made, good price","These look great and are all very functional. I've had them for just a few days and I've already used every piece. Not too heavy, but durable and well constructed. They're a little shorter than I thought they would be but it's not much of a problem and makes for better handling.EDIT!: Docking a star because the flat spatula is a little thick and very inflexible, which makes it had to get under some things and flip. Quality wise though, no complaints."
5,Nice utensils for the price,"Not long ago we updated all of our kitchen cooking utensils to either wood (bamboo) or stainless steel. We purchased this set of items to add on to our collection. They are nice for the price. Easy to clean, work well, and match our other stainless steel utensils, pots, and pans just fine. I would definitely buy these again for the price and quality of items that you recieve."
2,ktchen utensils,I have used these utensils for about two months and the whisk has already broke. I think before it is over they all will break. The joint at the handle is weak.My recommendation is to buy another brand.
3,utensil set,"I suppose these utensils are o.k. for the price, but I was disappointed in the quality. The handles are hollowed out on the back side and are not very sturdy. The picture when ordering does not show this. I will use them till they wear out, but will not order this set again."
3,"Solid, but not amazing.","Perfectly functional, but a little less heavy duty than I was hoping for. Whisk is the weakest in the bunch. Spoons work great."
3,Golden Apples Of the Sun...,"The ten cuts on this CD are all good. Robert James Waller, author of the book BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY sings these songs with verve and feeling. He had performed in road houses, like Rodney Crowell, and has a way with the ballad. His renditions of 'Wabash Cannonball,' 'Tangerine,' and 'Idaho Rain' were fantastic.However, his narration of 'Golden Apples of the Sun' taken from Yeats poem, ""The Song of Wandering Aengus"" was the best on this collection. It can't be beat by anyone, even Orson Welles. I wanted to share it with Chuck Southcott on his birthday last month, but he didn't want it. Too Bad. He doesn't know what he missed. 'The Dutchman' and 'Girl From the North Country' are enigmatic and well-done.Waller is an all round good artist in music and writing. He has a new novel out and I can't wait to read it."
1,Does not work,"Read the positive and negative reviews and decided to try it myself. FIrst time, 30 minutes, still ice cold. Second time, one hour, still cool. I don't know about anyone else but i think an hour would get it at room temperature without this device. WOuld not recommend and I am wondering if those positive reviews are fake."
1,terrible,I've bought two of these because I thought the first one was broken. They do not heat a cold bottle at all. I've had a bottle in there for 45 min. and it was not even room temp. terrible
2,"Good idea, bad execution","This product does not work well. It takes more than 20 min to get a bottle warm enough for my baby to want it. Which wouldn't be as much a problem if we could schedule his eating time. But when he's hungry and the bottle is cold, you have to listen to a fussy baby for what seems like hours until the bottle is warm."
2,Not worth the $,I got this for a 12 hr car trip we took recently and I must say I don't care for it. The only thing it does is keep the bottle somewhat warm if the bottle was already warm to begin with. But warming up cold water...forget it!
1,DO NOT BUY,"We bought this item before going on a long trip. I figured that even though all the reviews were bad, it would be better than nothing. I was WRONG. We had the bottle in there for more than a half hour, and it was still cold. I took the bottle, and held it next to my skin for five minutes and it warmed up right away. So, if you have to choose between having nothing and buying this product, then choose nothing, and just use your body heat to warm it up."
2,Takes forever to warm a bottle,"We received this as a baby gift from our registry selection. The concept is great, but the execution is lacking. If you have a cold bottle, you can expect to wait 30-40 minutes before the bottle is barely warm enough for the baby. We drove to Huntsville last weekend and knew that our daughter needed to eat in an hour. Rather than waiting until she was ready to eat to start warming the bottle, we started warming it an hour ahead of time. It was warm enough by then. You definitely don't have to worry about the bottle getting too hot. You would have to drive 4 hours for that, although I've not confirmed it. =)We have a DC power inverter and I tried plugging in our regular bottle warmer but all it did was blow the fuse. Now I'm searching for a better alternative than the Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Warmer that I'm reviewing here."
2,Maintains warmth only,"It will keep an already-hot bottle warm, but it will not heat a bottle up, which was disappointing. I guess I can still use it to keep bottles warm for short trips."
1,Doesn't work.,"I've never written a product review before, but this product was such a disappointment, I wanted to spare other moms... As a previous poster noted, the heating wrap gets warm, but never warm enough to heat the contents of a bottle. After 45 minutes, our formula had inched its way up from cold to barely room temperature, and after that much time, I started to worry about food safety. Going through the Starbucks drive-through and asking for an extra cup of piping hot water to warm a bottle in is more practical than using this product."
1,I hate this bottle warmer!,"Before purchasing this bottle warmer from Target, I had the regular bottle warmer by Munchkin (not the deluxe one shown here). The original would heat a bottle pretty quickly to a pretty high temperature (which was great for long car rides!). This one, however, does not work. I can't even get it to keep a bottle warm after I have warmed the water in the microwave and then place the bottle in the warmer in the bag and plug it in. Maybe mine has a defect, but from my personal experience, the original munchkin car bottle warmer works MUCH better."
3,It's ok for a travel bottle warmer,"I use Adiri bottles which take too long to warm no matter what bottle warmer you use. I am happy with this travel bottle warmer; it takes about 25 min to warm 6oz of milk, and around 45 min if the milk is very cold. It keeps the bottle warm after you unplug it for some time but not too long. I use it every time I go out with my baby!"
1,Does not warm a bottle,"While the inside of this device does get warm to the touch it will not warm a bottle (even a room temperature bottle). Munchkin is usually a great brand, but this item was a disappointment."
1,Worst thing ever,I have never been able to warm even room temperature milk in this warmer. doesn't heat even a little bit. I would really like to give it 0 stars if there was such an option.
1,Horriable,We were never able to get the bottle past room temperature. Waited at least 30 min which for a crying and hungry baby is forever.
1,Not impressed!,"The bottle warmer said it would work with any type of bottles. I tried using it with Avent bottles. They fit inside the warmer, but they never warmed up. I could feel the warmer getting hot, but nothing ever happened to the formula. I even tried heating it up well in advance of my crying baby, but it still never heated. This is a complete waste. If I could find my receipt, I would return it."
1,Didn't work,I attempted to use this bottle warmer with Born Free bottles...I had the bottle inside (supposedly being warmed up) for nearly 30 minutes and nothing. The actual heating insulation arm would heat up but not the bottle. Very unimpressed and returned it.
1,Did not work,"This product did not work. Although the warming device seemed to be working, it did not heat a glass or plastic bottle up in any attempts up to 25 minutes."
1,IT STARTED SMOKING!,"We used this a couple times in the car to warm an already luke warm bottle. It takes a long time for it to get anywhere close to warm with it being in there for 30 minutes, but I assumed that was a safety precaution so things didn't get too hot too fast in the car.WELL, after using it for the 3rd time, my husband noticed it started smoking! At first he thought it was steam, but then he opened the warmer to check and a metal peice was burning through the plastic and started melting the bottle!DO NOT BUY THIS, it is a serious safety hazard...I also talked to my sister about it because she had one previously, and theirs also started smoking in the car so bad they had to throw it out the window into a snow bank.Do not risk it..."
1,Takes way to long to warm the bottle,Sadly i wasted my money on two of these. My daughter will not take a bottle unless it is body temp or warmer so i thought a car bottle warmer would be a great idea. I ended up having to leave the bottle in the warmer for about 40 min and it still was just lukewarm and she wouldn't take it. They take way to long to warm the bottle up. I do not recommend this product at all.
3,An amusing tale of morality in a 1800's Spanish community:,"The Three Cornered Hat is an amusing tale of mistaken identities and moral folkways in the Spain of early 1800's. Though the plot is not an entirely original one (the reader can recall similar stories such as Chaucer's Reeve's Tale), the story is written in an original way, describing the Andalucian countryside and colorful examples of local characters.Alarcón is an author unknown in most of the world outside of Spain, but I recommend the book as an easily readable and largely enjoyable example of his work."
3,"Good Read, Great Heroine","This is #9 in Rimmer's Bravo series, where we discover the fate of the Lost Bravo Baby (think Lindbergh Baby).I liked the hero, I liked the families on both sides, and mostly, I LOVED the heroine. Joleen is awesome!Standard plot for a Category Romance, the marriage of convenience to protect custody of a child. But the interactions between the characters make this book a stand out. Honorable mentions include the mother-daughter talks, the brothers talking by the pool and the grandmothers' friendship.Enjoy."
4,A fine read,"This is an excellent book, even though the least convincing part of it is the attempt to show similarites between the Talmud and the internet. It is really a meditation on what Judaism means to the author. The book consists of the author's reflections on many Jewish themes, with the essential theme being the acceptance of contradictions. Judaism can be viewed in many ways that may seem like opposites, but in reality create a profound way of thinking that reflects the contradictions in life. I give it four stars, not five, only because, at about 100 pages, it is really a long essay, not a book."
4,"The children of Rock and Roll never grow old, they just fade away.","This is a tribute album to the Rutles, the Beatles parody group. All 20 songs from the Rutlesfirst albumare covered here. Most of the cover versions here are pretty good. Long live Rock and Roll!"
2,picture quality!,"Hello support,I'm quite disappointed with the very very.. poor picture quality of the dvd! (all of them) I do like Tony Sanches yoga ( I've used it before and the picture quality was great).However, the picture quality of all the DVDies that I purchased are extremely poor, I'd like to receive a better quality DVD or refund.Regards,Shaun"
4,TRACK LISTING,1. Anytime (L-A's Feel Good Radio Mix) 3:392. Anytime (L-A's Feel Good Dance Mix) 5:013. Anytime (Trip Style Melody Mix) 3:504. Anytime (Definitive Mix) 6:115. Anytime (Euro Mix) 5:48
5,Mind-blowing aphorisms...,"This young lady's writings and personal story blow away most other 20th Century thinkers. These are mainly short blasts. Provocative. Accessible. Yet push you further than you've likely been. Lots of ancient Christian desert hermit influence (St. Theresa, St. John of the Cross, Philokalia) on this revolutionary, radical mind. Timeless. Challenging. Simple. Confounds modernism."
5,A startlingly authentic spirituality that doesn't shy away from suffering,"I admit that since I am a student of analytic philosophy the axiomatic format made it difficult to follow the author at times. It is just not the kind of writing to which I am accustom. If you like writtings which take a thoroughly explicit and systematic approach to religious questions this book is probably not for you. Still, I think it is impossible to read this book without being moved by the power the author's holiness. I found many of these sayings profoundly beautiful (I am especially enamored with the section on love) and some unsettling but always deeply moving. I believe this is one of those rare books which can change a person's life."
2,reject,"The one I received was evidently a return. The top screw was stripped, the rubber grip was split, and the rest of the screws were loose. As I had to have it, I was able to retap the screw hole, and make it work. Since I used it for a shoot, I will keep it, but this is something to watch for."
4,Party on!!!,"A great track that always gets me in that party mooood!! In fact, this is a dance classic, no matter what you may think :) Buy now, and get a friend to spill beer on you..."
1,disappointed,My husband opened yesterday morning for Christmas and most of the tracks skip! Very disappointed. I had rewrapped in Christmas paper after receiving several days ago so did not keep the original package or I would return.
3,Extra Material Lacking,"This review pertains only to the ""extra tracks"" version of this album. ""America"" has never been a favorite of mine, with the live version being slightly less plodding than the studio version, and it's certainly not representative of the best of Yes. Sadly, the ""early rough mix"" of ""Roundabout"" isn't much different than the album version. There are a few hiccups, and the mix is, indeed, rough, but it's the same track as the album version. A demo version or something like that would have been better, and there was certainly room to add a few more extras to this album."
4,Ahead of its time...?,"This album is undeniably brilliant. The amazing virtuosity displayed by each musician, coupled with the intricate arrangements, makes for an intense and exhilarating listen. It is amazing to think that this was released in 1972. It still sounds modern and ""avant-garde"" to me. But, the only gripe about this album is the slightly unpleasant aftertaste left by the five solo pieces. Although most of them are interesting enough, I can't seem to rid myself of the feeling that I'm listening to filler instead of actual songs. Nevertheless, Fragile is (ironically) a potent statement of advanced musicality."
5,A Classic!,I purchased this album after I bought THE VERY BEST OF YES and I Must say that this was a much better cd in that the songs were clearly outside of the pop-realm with the exception of roundabout. Cans and Brahms is a killer track for lack of a better term. I liked South Side of the Sky and Heart of the Sunrise. Those two songs make the cd in my opinion but the other songs are great. Any fan of YES should have this album!
1,more drop-outs. drop this,"hi there. i'm danish and a very big yes fan for more than 25 years. when i saw this special-edition was available, i couldn't resist. i bought it for a total of $$. i can't describe my dissapointment with all them drop-outs, specially on the ROUNDABOUT, i've always been told, that japanese were perfectionist. the japanese people who have made my copy must have had a very bad day. my advise is, go bye the RHINO remaster, it looks and sounds perfect. absolutely no drop-outs and the sleeve and booklets are better. AND IT ONLY COST YOU A THIRD"
5,Positive Name to a Positive group.,All you have to do is listen to the arrangements and the technical side to what YES play and you can see that they are professionals in what they do. They've taken the Idea of 20th Composition and turned it around into a style of rock that is so listenable to. There music live on for some time as turning point in the history of 70's Rock.
4,Great classic rock,"I love this album. I'm not a professional reviewer of music but I can tell you that if my kids like the music it seems like it's destined to be a classic. They have an uncanny sense of taste when it comes to music. This one was already a classic when they latched onto it. There's at least one song on here that my son recognized from the Wii game ""Rock Band III"" and also from the movie ""School of Rock"" which is one of our family favorites. He asks me to play this CD over and over in the car for him. Kid has good taste."
2,Progressive Rock or Progressive pop?,"I was really amazed to find so many rave reviews about this album and that is what prodded me to give this album a try.In fact this is the second Yes album I am listening to, the first being Big Generator.Rest assured I am a fan of other Progressive bands such as Tull,King Crimson,Gentle Giant etc.I think the major problem with yes is Jon anderson's vocals which I feel is more suitable for pop music.Also the music seems to be extremely pretentitious and artificial lacking any sense of direction or harmony.There is a mishmash of pop,classical and hard rock and these are blended incoherently, unlike other prog bands that I mentioned above,thus resulting in cacaphony.Now, I have come to believe that Yes is one of the most overrated bands in the prog rock circuit.Rest assured, this album is definitely a shade better than Big Generator."
4,"Not as good as it's made out to be, but still essential","Fragile is a good album. Not great, but good. It's one of those albums that you don't have to like, but you do have to ""appreciate"". Musically, this album leaves something to be desired. The true compositions (Roundabout, Heart of the Sunrise, and South Side of the Sky) are excellent, no doubt about it. But the solo pieces are average to poor, and really serve as no more than filler (as a matter of fact, this album was rush-released to pay for Wakeman's huge number of keyboards). However, as it is the genesis of Yes' finest era, it must be ""appreciated"". Just don't expect much beyond the first and last tracks."
5,The Yes breakthrough,"The introduction of keyboardist Rick Wakeman was the final link in the ""classic Yes"" band. Suddenly the group's sound becomes infinately more expansive with Wakeman's incredible arsenal of instruments. This album is considerably more moody than ""The Yes Album,"" with tight, aggressive instrumental playing and experimental production techniques. ""Roundabout,"" ""Long Distance Runaround,"" and ""Heart Of The Sunrise"" would all become staples of the Yes live set (AND FM radio), while the experimental solo tracks put the band far outside the pop mainstream (Wakeman's ""Cans And Brahms"" is getting out there into ""Switched On Bach"" territory). If you can only afford to buy one Yes album, this is IT."
5,Yes-Their Height of Songwriting and Creativity,"Most Yes fans will try to sell you facts about 'how long this song is' or 'how non-commercial this is'. I don't care if an album is comercial or not. I am not a progsnob. I don't like Frank Zappa or 'Discipline'. Simply enough, I like music, and this album is impressive musically. While retaining normal, earpleasing forms of songwriting, Yes creates an intelligent, deep, reflective album. Chris Squire's bass still kicks serious butt while not being too wiierd. Jon Anderson's vocals are strong, he doesn't sound like elf man yet, and original drummer Bill Bruford has not left yet, because Anderson's lyrics are not that trippy yet. Songs like 'Roundabout', 'South Side of the Sky', 'Mood For A Day', and 'The Fish' still remain among my favorites. If you like the lighter forms of prog, but this album."
1,severe chanel drop outs,"YES......THESE REPLICAS ARE ALMOST INCREDIBLE... TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE... THE PACKAGING IS EXCELLENT, BUT.....WELL, MY FRAGILE COPY HAS A TERRIBLE ONE CHANNEL MINI DROPOUT IN ROUNDABOUT, ON THE VERY BEGGINING,. THIS IS UNADMISSIBLE FOR A YES FAN THAT PAYS 30 DOLLARS FOR A CD!MY GOING FOR THE ONE DOES TOO, SO MY CLOSE TO THE EDGE REPLICAS. I HAVE CHEKED OUT AND THIS DROPOUTS ARE ALL OVER SEVERAL OF THESE MINIATURES.LITTLE DROPOUTS, BUT FOR THIS PRICE, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT ! I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS STUFF ! YOU BETTER GET THE OLD REMASTERS OR WAIT FOR RHINOYES RE-RELEASES. I HAVE HEARD ROUNDABOUT ON YES' NEW BOX SET AND SOUNDS GREAT, WITHOUT THE DISSAPOINTING SOUND DROPOUTS."
4,Art rock classic.,"Even with its filler tracks, like Rick Wakeman's Brahms excerpts or Bill Bruford's jazz percussion ditty, 'Fragile' remains an essential rock album. AOR staples since their debut, ""Roundabout"", ""Long Distance Runaround"", and ""Heart of the Sunrise"" are all archetypal art rock songs, blending classical stuctures and heavy 70's guitar rock perfectly. Pretentious and even dated as it may indeed be, 'Fragile' is one of the cornerstones of 70's rock and indeed of the now-deceased AOR format."
3,Not Mike's Best Work,"I'm a huge fan but this collection is not up to his talent. The arrangements are cheesy, lacking the lush orchestrations of previous work. I wish he'd explain the selection of some obscure cuts. The Streisand duet is awful due to Babs' not being able to find her key. I can't say any of the songs are anything special. Too bad."
4,Very Impressive,"W.O.M.B. is a sound I can't place. With 3 passionate vocals and musical theater-like execution- I can't help but be entertained. On top of this, the lyrics are charged with this political-playful-sexy verse. I wish I could pigeon-hole this group to describe the music, but I can't-they call it ""kinetic"". The songs shift from composed/produced tracks like ""Freakin'"" and ""Buried Alive"" to completely raw, one instrument, one-take songs like ""Ghostrider"" and ""No Signal"". They go from a song about sex (""Muse Oven"") to a song about Halloween (""Halloween"") to a song about the government assasinating our leaders (""Shoot Me"")- yet the whole compilation works together because it's not trying to be anything else. It's very peculiar and I find myself singing their songs."
5,Tips on prevention are particularly well done,Mold growth is a wide-ranging problem only recently receiving recognition in the process: turn to the The Mold Survival Guide For Your Home And For Your Health for significantly more depth and advice than any ordinary newspaper article could offer. Indoor air quality professional teams join a writing specialist to describe different types of molds and how to eradicate them while maintaining health. Tips on prevention are particularly well done.
4,Good for its Value,"The Lexmark X2250 All-In-One offers graphics that rate as good and photos that are very good. However, text quality is only fair, and it offers minimal features for an AIO, with print, copy, and scan functions; no built-in fax modem; and no automatic document feeder. However, I personally believe it's good for its Value."
4,Post-Traumatic Readers Unite,"Kirby Farrell narrates this book like a pop-culture icon, yet he remains objective enough to sustain credibility. Heavily influenced by the works of Ernest Becker, Farrell compares seemingly uncomaprable films and novels through a filter of humanities' fears of death and desires for immortality. Farrell makes several strong arguments, yet gets caught up in a bit too many tangents for the general going public. This book is for a scholar. I know this sounds elitest, but this novel is for those who are well read, well versed, and comfortable dealing with topics that will make them feel uncomfortable because of their validity. Farrell has succeeded in created a fine piece of work worthy of coffee tables around the world...that is if you take your coffee black."
3,Consider ordering 1/2 size up,"The actual padding is comfortable, it's the leather body that cuts into the sides of my feet. Ordering a 1/2 size up might remedy this. I'm too lazy to do this. I'm wearing them around the house until they're broken in."
3,"fleshy, yet funny","From the Back Cover:Mai's a super counselor with blazing sex appeal who specializes in solving her clients' bedroom problems - and male clients are preferred! Obsession, compulsion, and demonic possesion are no match for her special brand of shock treatment. Patients are always cured, at the risk of a broken heart!This two part anime actually contains four mini-episodes that have Mai, a young and beautiful conselor, solving her clients many problems. From helping one man with multiple personality disorder, to helping a rock star who is scared of women removing their clothes, Mai is willing and able to do whatever it takes. While funny throughout most of the series, it seems most of life's problems can be solved by Mai taking her clothes off.Rated 16+ for a lot of nudity, a little language and gore, and some very scary looking old people."
5,Beautiful doll,"When my granddaughter opened the box, she kissed the doll and said, ""Pretty."" This is the second Madame Alexander Asian doll I've bought her. She's now two, and I expect to buy her many more. Both of them have a lovely Asian look and are well made enough for collectors and yet make wonderful dolls for play."
4,Fun book to read,"This book is a fun book to read. I really enjoy reading this book however I do think her first book ""Belly laugh"" was funnier."
2,"Come Jenny, write something for us working mom's!!!","I deceided to get Jenny's book, since I had my son about four months ago and it got alot of good reviews. I found the book predictable and not very interesting. There were a few parts that made me laugh. However, all and all I found the book not very exciting. Also, I thought she tired to relate to us ""everyday"" women, but she lost me when she suggested getting a personal trainer to help lose the baby weight. I mean come on, give me something that is realistic. I don't have to time or the money for a personal trainer. I am mother who works full time and takes care of my son. I don't have my afternoon's free to give my son to the nanny and have a personal trainer come to my house. Plus, she talks all this talk about her wonderful hunsband and how they made it through everything together. Give me a break, she is now divorced."
3,Just ok... would probably borrow instead of buy,"This book was ok. I really enjoyed Jenny's voice, but as far as laugh out loud funny, that only happened maybe 3 times. I expected it to be funnier. It seemed more geared toward people who are still pregnant. I read it when my son was almost 4 months old so not much of the advice helped me. I did however relate to a lot of what she said, but like the title says I would definitely borrow this one."
4,"Jenny, I'm ready for book #3!","I've loved both her books so much it makes me want to send a thank you letter for the laughter. Of course, I enjoyed Belly Laughs more as my husband would make me leave the room I was laughing so hard but Baby Laughs came in a close 2nd.Thank you Jenny for telling it like it is! I hope you find another hubby, get pregnant again, and Oh yes breastfeed this time around. As a nursing mother, I think I'd enjoy your prespective on breastfeeding and would love to share the experience through your book with you ."
3,Short book,Quick and easy read. Nice sense of humor and a cute distraction for an expecting mom or a new mom.
5,Hilarious!,"I loved Jenny's Baby Laughs as well as the first book, Belly Laughs! She is hilarious, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Jenny has a great sense of humor, but unfortunately her style is still, even in today's society, offensive to some people. If you like Jenny McCarthy, you will love her books. I felt as though I could actually relate to her in some situations. You can laugh because you know you have or will experience some of those same scenarios, and it comforts you to know every woman with children has been through it all, just like you. For a small break from this crazy-amazing-beautiful-emotional-new time in your life read Jenny's Baby books."
3,good for a laugh,"not as good as belly laughs but still worth reading. Chapters are short which is nice for those moms who don't have time to read. I couldn't relate to everything in the book but some parts were really funny like the chapter on ""anorexic pets"". Too true."
5,Very cute & Funny!,"This is obviously not a book if you're in true need of some guidance, nor was the pregnancy one. They are written to make you not take something so serious, so seriously. The pregnancy one was my favoirte, I just felt like finally, someone was saying something real. No, it's not medical, it's not all that useful for anyhting other than helping you realize you're not morphing into a freak, you're just normal. And, it's not gross, it's funny. Jenny McCarthy has not ever been someone I particualry liked or knew anything about. But I appreciate her bluntness, and humor."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"After reading ""Belly Laughs"" I knew I had to read the follow up book. It was just as funny, actually even dare I say funnier. I was laughing so hard I couldn't stop. A must read for anyone pregnant or with kids. Actually, a must read for anyone who wants a good laugh!"
1,"Moments of truth, hours of baloney","It may be that it has been too long since I've had a newborn. (my youngest is 3.) I've always enjoyed Jenny McCarthy's acting and when I saw this book I picked it up. I agree with some of the other reviews that she comes across as a very uninformed parent all the while claiming she did oodles of research (e.g. breastfeeding, circumcision).Needless to say I didn't enjoy this book, I didn't find it funny - perhaps Jenny is more of a visual artist, not literary.The one thing she nailed on the head was the chapter on mommy competition. While she did not explore this topic in depth, she did relate some amusing tales about hearing and dealing with this issue.Overall, I give this book 1 star. Luckily, it is a quick read and I didn't waste too much time reading it and I checked it out of the library, which I suggest you do also!"
3,Not as good as the first,"I read Jenny's first book, Belly Laughs, while pregnant with my first baby, and literally laughed so hard I cried. My husband read it and enjoyed it too, and he's not a reader at all. Every pregnant woman I loaned Belly Laughs to loved it.So when Baby Laughs came out, I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, it's just not as good as the first book. While the tone is similar, the material and stories just aren't as funny this time around. Not enough sleep while writing this one maybe? If she writes another book about raising toddlers I'll still buy it - I can imagine what fun she'll have with the stories toddlers give you!"
5,Loved it,"I was given this book as a shower gift. I'd read it during my last month. It was so funny, and gave me a real life idea of what to expect. I reread it about 5 weeks after giving birth, and couldn't help laughing at each thing that I'd also experienced. She tells it just like it is. This is a great gift idea."
1,Sad Book,The book had it's funny moments (very few and far between)but over all it painted a horrible picture of motherhood. The book was really sad to me; I wanted to cry for her son.
1,Brutally stupid...,"Seems as though Jenny's silicone breats have leaked..into her brain.Written in her vapid, obnoxious tone...this book made me want to claw my eyes out.D-list book from a D-list celeb."
1,I don't find it funny at all,She circumsised her son because she wanted his penis to 'look pretty' (her words) That is not funny. It's sick mutilation.I can't believe the above person who thinks that infant male mutilation is beneficial or has long term health benefits. Clearly you are living in the dark ages.
4,Loved it,"My cousin recommended the First book ""Belly Laughs"" while I was pregnant. That book was so dead on and hysterical! I loved every minute of it. This one is pretty funny but not anywhere near as good as the first. Still it made those first few weeks a little easier, when I could sit for a few minutes and read something light and funny to ease the my new mommy stress. :)"
4,So Hysterical!!,"I recommend this book to any new mom! It's also great to give as a gift for a new mom. It is laugh out loud hysterical, but also very honest! Not your typical ""What to expect..."" book"
5,Most helpful pregnancy book!!,This is a no-holds-barred book that gives you the real information without all the pc crap. There were things in this book that were graphic and tough to read but in the end I was very happy because I now feel much more prepared for childbirth and the first year of mommyhood. All the Jenny McCarthy books are great and I recommend that you read them all!!
4,No Epiphanies Just Entertainment,"Gave this as a gift, but perused it beforehand, its a cute, simple book. Good enough to keep my pal entertained during recovery."
4,Nice springs and give the described lift,"You get one spring so order 2. I put these on a 2000 Ford F250 that needed 5"" of lift in the rear to level out the ford after doing front 7"" springs and they are a nice fit giving about 4-1/2"" of lift. Used them and removed the 4"" lifting blocks which are dangerous above 2"" so wanted a better safer set up.One problem is I purchased 2 springs at the same time but Amazon only sent one. They where good about getting the other spring out when I contacted them but it put my install back 2 weeks due to their mistake. I would recommend purchasing one then check out and then go back and purchase another so you get 2 orders placed. This way they won't mess up the order by not checking the quantity."
1,Incitement,"Sheer incitement to racial hatred, as can be seen from a couple of the reviews! Pits ""the African"" against ""the Caucasian"". States that Caucasians are mass-murderers. etc."
1,Don't Waste your money,"I bought this book because I thought it would point me in the right direction nutritionally. It seems to me this is just an outright attack on nutrition WITHOUT real solutions. This is the classic ""Tell you what's wrong without presenting realistic ways to make it right."" I was very disappointed and there are plenty of other books that actually outline nutritional solutions that you could buy."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This book is an all out assault against the intelligence of black people. I NEED FOOT NOTES! Some of his claims are so ridiculous, not to mention racist. I'm all for educating the black community but there should be proof to support his outrageous claims. I feel that 99% of this book are mainly his own thoughts and theories. I would like to wipe my ass with its pages, which will probably be an insult to my ass."
5,Another Ray Conniff Classic!,"It's been 45 years when this Concert in Rhythm Volume 2 hit the record stores and this version features the timeless sound of the Ray Conniff orchestra. I am hopeful there will be more C.D.'s with this selection of classic music a la Ray Conniff. Personal favorites include an uptempo version of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, and Liebestraum. Another classic that makes you want to dance is Poeme by Fibich. When this C.D. hits the market buy it! It's another quality work by Ray Conniff!"
5,Excellent Coverage,"I love the coverage of this foundation. I've been strictly a cream foundation person for a long time, but I wanted something that would give a nice soft glow for Spring and I'm really glad that I found this foundation. I'm too young to be using it for the ""age rewind"" part of the formula - so I can't attest to whether that works or not - but the finish is great. Like most liquid foundations you'll definitely need a setting powder, but once it's set you get a nice glow without that dewy/oily look."
2,alright,I really don't know what to think of this foundation. The coverage is okay. But every time I wear this foundation it makes my skin look pink.
1,Maybeline Instant Age Rewind Foundation,I received this product opened and used which is not fair. In addition the color was a bit lighter thanI expected
4,nice song,"pink is eve, toni braxton, tlc and lil kim all in 1. this song is one of my favorites, heard all over radio right now. who cant get enough of most girls??? when it gets played at the clubs people get up and dance just for the song and then sit back down. yes that is true. also the 3 remixes by skribble are pretty tight. worth buying."
1,False Advertising!,"The shakers pictured are awesome. However, these are not the shakers I received. The ones I received are shorter and bulbous at the bottom. The tops do not stay on well at all, and the cap that snaps shut is flimsy and has a difficult time staying snapped shut. Rubbermaid's new version of the shakers pictured do not hold a candle to the shakers pictured. If you can find the ones in the picture--double check before ordering--get them instead."
4,Great Book,Fantastic book detailing the events of this unique period in American History. I bought the book to try to get insight into our current economic situation. Maybe it didn't generate any profound insights on how to manage or position myself to avoid the Great Depression expereince but a great read nonetheless.
3,Subtle unsubstantiated bias,"The pictures are plentiful and very helpful in this unbalanced overview of the Great Depression, the research and writing are admirable, but the tone shows a subtle and insidious bias in favor of unions, socialists and minorities. No where near enough attention is paid to the everyday struggle of people to simply survive. Watkins pays little attention to organized crime, bootlegging and petty thievery that raise the level of fear of all citizens during that period. Watkins also ignores the efforts made by many small, medium and large businesses help their employees get by, choosing instead to paint businesses as manifestations of the evils of capitalism. Far too emotional for a scholarly work."
5,Wonderful a blessing to my spirit and soul,"My uncle sent this book to my sister for her High School graduation and I begin to glimpse through it--actually I couldn't put the book down! I found myself totally and completely absorbed by the comfort and knowledge Susan L. Taylor shared. This book is so full of truth, love, compassion, understanding (of self) and spiritual healing that I often smiled with joy from head to toe and bathed in all the happiness that was shared. I savored and sipped very slowly all of the passages and ""I WILL"" read it again and again. Susan L. Taylor is truly a kindred spirit and blessed individual! I plan to purchase this book as a christmas item for my girlfriends."
3,No size,"Great looking product but there was no size listed when I purchased this item. Therefore when I gave it as a gift to my sister's boyfriend, the inside piece was too small for his head. I think we'll be able to switch out the inner piece though."
3,Not Bad,"This title was only OK. I have just started getting into comics in the last year or so and I've been playing catch up to get in on some of the more important story lines. This might be my least favorite, it is worth a read for keeping up with the Marvel universe. The House of M spin off titles I do not recommend at all they were pretty weak."
2,Poor quality,"Read the good reviews and thought that this was the right one for me. It had enough slots for my needs. After receiving and during the process of putting in the knives, I noticed that my chef knife caught something while being put into the block. Took my flashlight and look inside. The bottom portion inside the slot had a wood sheet that split off from the rest and appeared to be the result of poor drilling/shaving. Very poor quality. Returning the item..."
4,Perfect for large knife collection,"I recently remodeled my kitchen and wanted a knife block that presents a tilted front. The angle of this knife block is perfect for my new granite countertops and now resides under our cabinet beside the stove. The block holds a lot of knives! 8 steak knives is just about perfect for most dinner parties, and there are ample slots for the range of cooking knives that I have. My only disappointment with this block is that my Wusthof meat fork does not fit in the slot intended for a fork... And expensive block for one that does not fit a wusthof product! This is the reason for docking the block one star. Aside from that this block fits my needs perfectly."
1,Misleading?,"I thought I was paying a premium price for German craftmanship by Wusthof, but this unit arrived with a Made In China sticker on the bottom.I don't have a problem with the unit itself, but I feel misled about the origin of the product and therefore will be returning it."
4,Nice Block!,"Nice knife block, looks exactly like the picture. Had a Henkle 17 slot block and needed something larger after getting additional knives for Christmas. Good finish, nice size. Glad I got it. Recommended!!"
5,Another Good Story by Sue-Ellen Welfonder,I loved this book....Sir Marmaduke Strongbow deserved to be loved ...even though it took awhile before Lady Catherine discovered that he was the soul mate for her. I like books that make me cry and make me smile...this book does it. Oh and I loved the sensual parts too. The only complaint I have is these books cannot be written fast enough for me....so I wait impatiently for the next book by Sue-Ellen Welfonder.
5,"Finally! The sequel to ""Devil In A Kilt!"" Sir Marmaduke Strongbow's story....","This is by far my favorite Welfonder novel. I fell in love with Sir Marmaduke Strongbow in ""Devil in a Kilt."" Sir Marmaduke is a horribly scarred, disfigured warrior with a beautiful heart longing to love again. Lady Caterine Keith, Linnet's sister btw, is a twice-widowed lady in need of a champion. Linnet and Duncan put her plight before Sir Marmaduke, and he cannot refuse to ride to her aid. Unknown to him, Lady Caterine hates Englishmen...and he is an Englishman...a dastardly Sassenach. Though English by birth, his heart beats for Scotland, and he determines he will slay the ""dragons"" in his lady's heart one by one and win her for himself. This is a beautiful story for a true hero with a beautiful heart. This is one that I couldn't put down after beginning to read it."
3,Not for me......,"First time I read a book by this author. I really liked Marmaduke Strongbow, who is out to woo his fair lady. The author gives you a side of the hero not normally found in romance books - she lets you see how vulnerable he feels about his scars and the use of his ""beauty cream"" in secret. Unfortunately I thought he should have wooed someone other than Caterine - I never warmed to her. I cared more for his first wife's ghost, Arabella, than Caterine. Only reason I gave this book 3 stars was because of Marmaduke."
1,Boring and lacking in true love,Call me old fashioned but this book was too much like the last one I read. I thought she might have change her format but I was wrong. I found myself forced to re-read lines because they were so sing-songy that they didn't make any sense. Not only that this book should definately have a rating on it! It isn't for teenagers under 18. The oral sex scenes are disgusting and so repetitive that I found myself shuddering. The plot could have been good but the lack of love between the two characters left me cold. Not only that I have a hard time believing that Caterine who was raped multiple times by soldiers doesn't have deep emotinal problems and she would need tenderness instead of constantly thinking about his groin.Marmaduke has the same problem and if I had a dollar for every time he thought about it I could buy another book. I won't be buying any more of this authors work.
1,major typo alert!,"Do not buy this book! Unless you don't mind your reading experience being totally ruined by typos. This WOULD be a great novel, if not for the fact every page (I mean it!) has at least one major gaffe on it, some of them revealing that English was not the proofreader's original language. I will never purchase a book from this publisher as I do not want to invest in behavior of this kind."
4,Very Gripping Love Novel!!,"I read the novel in Russian. Never read in English, but looking forward to it. I think it is one of the best George Sand's novels. It is full of mysterious and exciting moments. I hope the book in English is as fabulous as in Russian."
3,Buyer be aware....,"I just picked up the blue version of this spice jar.All is as described except there is no liner in the cap, so if you remove the sprinkle insert then it's bare metal on glass. This won't be an air tight seal which is what you want for your spices. I've been looking online but without much luck for cap liners. I've found new caps with liners that will fit these jars but they are of the baby food variety or have a metal rim like the Spice Islands jars which aren't quite as sharp-looking as these RSVP ones. May have to get the latter tho, to keep the spices fresh.Cheers,"
1,Turned it off after two songs,"This video was so hard to follow. But it was nice of Ms. Austin to put the instructions on how to do the line dances at THE END of the video...she didn't give any instruction during the exercise portion of the tape. I was confused so I just turned off the tape. My advice, don't waste your money."
4,I like it!,This Money clip is ideal. I recently turned 18 and i wanted a money clip so i can not only keep my bills crisp but look professional. And with the sale i got for them it wasnt that much. the only thing is the chrome chips but i think thats going to happen since it is in your back pocket all day.
2,Not high enough,Product arrived as specified. One thing to note is that this is a 'thin' money clip. I normally carry 5-7 credit cards and a few bills. Its not high enough to hold these and will require a lot of stretching.
4,Hole Problem,"I use this clip to hold credit cards and bills. Which means I have stretched it out a little, but it still works. Also the turned up portion of the clip has dug holes in a lot of my jeans. Overall I am happy with the clip but would warn people that this will dig a very square hole in your back pocket."
4,Fine,I enjoy this money clip. Nothing terribly special about it. It keeps my money clipped and that is what I wanted. Originally it was placed on back order by the vendor but he was very swift in sending it once it had come in.
2,Everything that glitters....,"I rated this product a 2 star because of the lack of resilience of the finish. Out of the box it has a brilliant luster, but after a few weeks parts of the finish chipped away leaving rusted areas."
5,Feel like Rain will touch your soul.,"It's great music when you want to just meditate, praise God or nod your head. The group has a refreshing sound to spiritually profound words."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Didn't listen to this one on Amazon.com first -- should have. Purchased it based on the strength of how much I enjoyed the first outing. In comparison, it's quite boring. It's like listening to any other artist out there. It won't be listened to very much."
1,not very good.,"all the songs were about religion! and they weren't even well performed. I'm not sure these guys practice enough, or have enough talent to be good. and they really need to start writing songs about more subjects. who the hell wants to listen to an hour of music about a mythical figure living up in the clouds? if they are going to write religious songs, couldn't they put one on here about buddha, or mohammed, or quexacoatl for that matter?"
5,GREAT PRODUCT,These latches were very easy to install and ease of operability while working with an animal makes life just that much easier too.
1,1621 A New Look At Thanksgiving,This book is very revisionist. It presents the idea of greedy Pilgrims vs. noble and enlightened savages. Very unbalanced in its depiction of history.
5,Purchase for the Great Photos,"I grew up before there was an Internet. Every single cliche about the first Thanksgiving shaped my mind's view of the event. I thought the Pilgrims wore large hats with buckles and that the Indians wore feathered war bonnets and trade blankets. I imagined some sort of a serious dinner around a large table. It turns out that almost all of the cliches I grew up with were wrong.The beauty of ""1621: A New Look at Thanksgiving"" is that it is filled with beautifully shot photographs of modern day reenactors. These reenactors are meticulous in their desire to carefully recreat the material culture of 1621. It is a real delight to look at their clothes and all their various possesions. I am so pleased that my children will grow up with a more realistic idea of what happened at the first Thanksgiving. This is a great book that will be enjoyed by both parent and child alike. Highly recommended."
2,Not good caramel.,"I was under the assumption they were Kraft caramels. Not even close. These have barely any flavor and a waxy, hard consistency. Total waste of money. Next time I will make sure what brand I'm purchasing."
3,Caramels,This is my husband's favorite. We used to be able to get them from a corner store. The ones I ordered do not compare with the stores and they do not have a brand name on them. These were hard and not as much flavor.
5,Excellent series,"Acorn Media does not disappoint with the programs they produce. This one was great, location scenery is beautiful. I would recommend"
5,"Stark and brutal, but very good.","This series, typical of the United Kingdom/Irish TV, has only a few episodes a season. The characters are very believable and the plots are often surprising. The series is very brutal in its honest depiction of the Irish country side. Has a slightly meloncholic tenor to it, much like Mankell's Wallander series."
3,Not so great,"Initially I enjoyed this series, but gradually grew tired of cars speeding down one road or another when the obvious goal was not as much to advance the story line as to show off scenery. It just isn't as good as some of the better BBC series; the action and acting doesn't draw one into the film in quite the same way."
3,"Good guide, but...","This book is certainly a good guide for people living in the US who have to face polluted drinking water in their homes, but if you are a scientist working for some time already in the field of water treatment I recommend that you keep your fingers off this book. This book is certainly written for the broad public and doesn't offer much news for the experienced reader. Especially if you live outside the US this book is not very suitable. It's just a shame that ""real"" engineering books are always so expensive."
3,"Useful, but not Mandatory","This book is a primer for those interested in obtaining better quality drinking water. If you've spent ten hours or more researching the subject, this book won't radically alter your worldview. However, what it does do well is fill in the cracks. It features pages of distributors and suppliers; it discusses in depth the various types of filters and why they work; it does feature some interesting tidbits (faucet-mounted filters are largely ineffective!). This book only confirmed the direction I was going in -- to get a three-step desktop filter, the best that you can do without moving up to a distillation system.On the negative side, occasionally the writer reveals a hypochondriac's fixation with germs and gives vent to his pro-regulatory biases. On the positive side, the book is short, eminently readable, and gives a solid overview of the subject with a few new nuggets of knowledge.In short, useful, but not mandatory."
2,Broadway Sweat....,I happen to like the other Broadway tapes from Richard Simmons much better! I enjoy the music and workout in the others much more. I really like the Broadway Blast Off and Tone Up on Broadway (uses the Richard Simmon's chest/arm stretch cord)tapes. I just did not enjoy this one.
3,this was interesting,this was really a bizarre story yet made believable by skillful direction and performances. Wife was a new kind of film for me as i have not experienced many japanese films beyond say guinea pig and naked blood type shockers. this was a nice change. this sort of thing deffinately appeals to the darker side of voyeurism. i admittedly got a kick out of the sadistic shenannigans. not so sure if i would watch this again any time soon but it is well worth a look. kind of wish i hadnt purchased the initial us release for $20 since a new proper release has recently become available for a couple dollars more. i do recall the picture being rather dark and muddy and hopefully the new release corrects this. i would consider upgrading.pretty odd little psycho sexual film. a better release would warrant 4 stars.
3,Wife to Be Sacrificed...,"More Bondage from Japan...it's okay otherwise, considering the time this flick was made...Three stars..."
2,"David Clarke ""Frenchie""",Lanuage barrier is difficult to master. Plot is way out and not the type of film I enjoy. Would not recommend it.
1,Cheap and wrong color,This bag is not worth buying. It's thin and cheaply made. Not even worth the postage to try to return it. It was sent in the wrong color. I won't purchase from this company again.
2,"Interesting subject, strange and odd treatment","Ehring's book is an interesting attempt (in part) to solve the question of what allows ordinary objects to persist through time. He defends a ""causal trope"" account to this end. His development criticizes (amongst others) the views of Donald Davidson on events, and does not do adequate justice to exploring them for his purposes. His references to this part of the metaphysics literature are woefully underdeveloped. The issues he raises are important and interesting, but appear to be muddled. Like much metaphysics these days, it fails to do much contact with science and technology which would (if done well) no doubt improve its content."
2,Starting to show its age,"As of the copy I bought this book is no longer really up to date with the latest techniques and the latest version of PS - CS2.As a senior Vfx artists there was some stuff of interest but it would be much better for a student than a practicing VFX artist.It is not a waste of time but it would be nice to see more on newer things like Smart objects, HDR, layer groups and alike. It would be worth checking out if there is a new edition."
4,"good, and useful","You will make nothing cool in this book as far as examples, tutorials go, but what it will do is concentrate on solid methods you can use to get the most out of photoshop. Most content is geared toward small tweaks, processes you can use to add quality to your work. For example, most people use the unsharp mask or sharpen tools to crispen images, in addition to this, she will show you some lesser-known features such as high-pass, which may give better sharpening results in many situations. This whole book is based on stuff like that. So if you are interested in exploring lesser-known ways of going about things, then you should get it. My guess is that intermediate artists would benefit the most from this. Even beginners will get something out of it. All in all this is a good title."
3,Good....But,"I'm surprised that, while most of the albums are showcased with two or more songs on this disc, there's only one song from one of their best albums - Double Vision. How can a Foreigner live album not have Hot Blooded on it?The addition of Hot Blooded and Blue Morning, Blue Day would have made this more apealing to me."
3,Foreigner Live CD,"I accidentaly purchased this thinking I was buying a DVD. Foreigner is one of those rare bands that manages to sound raw and polished all at the same time with their studion recordings. This allows you to close your eyes and imagine you're listening to a really fabulous LIVE performance. Consequently this live CD, without video, doesn't really add anything, and in fact loses the balance & audio quality of their studio work."
5,"Valdosta, GA The Sweetest Town in the World!!!","I think Valdosta, GA is the sweetest town in the world, maybethe very sweetest and I love everything it's got. I make a lottalove with the town. I think I would love to live near there."
5,Buy Now as it really works,"Being a LMT, I help a lot of my clients on pain relief. This book is a wonderful source honing my skill. It addresses a lot of common muscle pains bothering my clients. I vouch all the techniques covered in this book work well.Even though this book is a self-treatment guide, I personally believe massage therapists get the most benefit out of it. I recommend all the message therapists who are into deep tissue and trigger point to use this book as a reference."
5,A hint,"When you get your copy of this book, take it to Kinkos or your local equivalent, and have them cut the spine off, and spiral-bind it so that it will lay flat and stay together. It will cost you less than $5.Also, make about ten copies of the title page to hand out to others, so you give them purchasing info and do not feel obliged to lend it.This book is spreading like a chain letter, and deserves to. It is likely to be judged in the future the greatest contribution to public health of the decade. Knock-offs are beginning to appear; I do not find it credible that its imitators could improve on it one iota."
5,This is a must,This book is a must for therapeutic body work professionals. Also helpful to anyone who is motivated enough to do it to themselves. It is clear and specific. Very easy to read and understand.
5,APC Notebook surge protector,I had to go with a trustworthy brand name for this item considering the cost of my laptop. That and the $5000 replacement warranty if anything is damaged while using the unit made this a no-brainer. The weight is negligible and the in-line design is far more convenient that a multi plug surge adapter. I have no need for the phone line protection but its good to have just in case. At the price you can't possibly go wrong with this item. A definite must have for your notebook/laptop.
2,good only for two prong connections,"This device is excellent, if you have a laptop with a two prong connector. It, however, will not work, if your laptop has a three prong connector for the power adapter. There is nothing on Amazon's site or on J&R's site that indicates that this device is for the two pronged connectors. I would think that most new laptops, like my new one, has a three prong connector. J&R dragged its feet, when I asked for a refund."
1,For an Emotional trip - but terrible book,"I agree with Mark bennett ""Mark"" and wish I could have read it as fast as his four hours, I wasted 12 hours,"
3,"Liberal bias, anyone?","They lost the sale for me the minute I read in the synopsis that Barack Obama is America's best hope for restoring the world's faith in our government. Fraudulent nobel prize, failure in the Israel/Palestine deal that he never should have gotten involved in, escalation in Afganistan after promising withdrawal, loss of a longstanding ally (Egypt), failure to deal with nuclear proliferation in Iran, questionable actions in Libya and gross economic incompetence...this is our best hope? And to think that I generally look to BBC as the alternative to shoddy yellow American journalism. Sorry, no sale."
4,Good way to figure out what you like best,I have always liked to eat and really like spicey foods so that means I ususally have to cook for myself. This is a great way to try different flavors and levels of hotness to experiment on what you like best and how different hotness' go in different receipies that you are making
3,kind of disappointed,"I am kind of disappointed. I was thinking they would have been hotter. For me, it wasn’t hot enough however for other they might be too hot."
1,disaponted,Two of the bottles were broken because they were pack with the maltas. You have to be more carefull when packing bottles. If you advertise gift pack they should be pack together. Bottles were loose.
2,disappointed,"Buyer beware. This is NOT a gift-pack, as portrayed. The picture on Amazon clearly showed a pack of 4 bottles packaged together in a pack that was suitable for wrapping up as a gift. However, the bottles arrived separate, not in any type of pack, just the way you might get at the grocery. I chose this brand over another specifically for the packaging aspect. The seller 'Latin Products' answered my complaint, advising that in e-commerce business, whenever any 4 items are sent together, it is termed a gift-pack. What nonsense.I now note that the picture online has been changed to show 4 separate bottles. Too late for my purposes."
1,You get what you pay for,"What a piece of junk! This is what they call an ISO - instrument shaped object.It broke down the second day, I took it to the local woodwind repair shop and was told they can't get parts for SKY instruments - and even if they could, it wouldn't be worth fixing it.For the same money, but a brand name USED flute. Make sure it is approved by the National Association of Music Educators - MENC approved.Don't throw away your money on an instrument that only frustrates the student (and parent)!"
2,Overrated.. by the other two reviewers,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheap Suit Serenader records and the curated collections by Crumb- I love his taste and it expanded my interest in the music of America's past. This album does not connect for me. It is an Original Cast Recording- which in retrospect I've come to realize means that all this music is created by people who not only like, but also perform in musicals. Musicals lack sincerity almost by definition. After all, they are the inhuman, plastinated smile of music- which is the polar opposite of what I've come to love about the music Crumb and pals have introduced me to. Net result is that there is nothing substantive to hold onto at all on this album.Save your money and fill out your Cheap Suit Serenaders collection or go with ""That's what I call Sweet Music"" (an AMAZING collection) or R. Crumb's Heroes of Blues, Jazz, & Country.This album is hokey, really hokey and I was disappointed.I gave up on it when the Casio keyboard came in.."
4,not bad at all,"most of the time you get what you pay for. but in this case you get a little more. the price at first made me a little worried that these were too cheap but if youre on a budget and would like to even out the range of your highs to lows this system ist bad. i hadnt really screamed these speakers but so far the quality is good. im running a p-1 rocksford 12"" with 6.5 JL speakers in the front and these are running in the back. im impressed with how it sounds with my system."
4,"good book, fun to read",good book. Informative for someone getting started in robotics. Explains different basic programming techniques for robot behavior. I had it as a textbook in my robotics class
3,alright,"i'm not sure what i was expecting from this text, but paired with my class i wasn't impressed. although it's not difficult text, i was expecting something closer to an engineering text."
1,Horror of mistakes,"I bought this book in hopes to learn something about AI Robotics (as the title misleads you to believe). I found only mistakes. One after another. It is clear that this woman does not know much about robotics, and was just in a hurry to get a book published. STAY AWAY from this one."
1,What A Waste Of Energy At A High Price Too!,I EXCERCISED MY ARMI purchased this video and used it three (3) times. First was to review it. Second was to use it. The Third Time - I got my excercise in the arms by throwing it out in the garbage. This video was produced poorly and the sound quality reverberates and it is irritating to where you cannot take this serious. It sounds like porno music. If you have seen the commercials you can hear the music in the background although it is faint. Borrow one from a friend first and you can judge for yourself. Working out with that music and the speech echos is just too much for me to bear. Sorry John Basedow but your performance was good but the video is just terrible. Try again.Mark Piergallini
5,"Great tape, great results!","Basedow's Basics provides the tools to better fitness and health through innovative exercises that strenghten and tone from head-to-toe. John's simple, motivational approach has taught me that I too can achieve my fitness goals through persistance and dedication. I've been using this tape for nearly three months now, and not only do I look better but I feel better, too. The results are amazing."
5,awesome hour is fantastic,i have purchased the john basedow's awesome hour upper body workout it is by far one of the best upper body workouts i have seen. i have had great results with this program. it is easy to understand and follow. john really knows what he's talking about when it comes to fitness and getting in shape. i would recommend this video and all of john's other videos to anyone really serious about getting and staying in shape.
3,Nothing compelling ....,"...about this book from a 3 and 5 year-olds view(in my judgement). It has nice illustrations, yet there are so many books with ""nice"" illustrations. It is thin on grabbing the boys attention who are both book-lovers. Although there are redeeming qualities such as the positive messages conveyed under most of the entries, this book is something I would rather have checked out of the library. Once."
1,DVD has terrible picture and sound quality,"This DVD produced by a company called Ground-Zero (with ""Black Belt Theatre"" marking on the front cover) seems to have been made from a worn-out VHS tape. The picture was terribly grainy and the sound volume varies frequently. The voice dubbing was hilariously bad. The plot involves a villain named Chia-Siu (roast pork?) who tries to kill a Tibetan prince and ignite a war between the prince's faction and the Shaolin temple. The movie largely consists of fight after fight, tied together by a thin plot. The fighting was good, but not the best I've seen. Pay close attention to the scene where the prince visits a temple during a funeral ceremony, and you will see a couple of black-and-white photographs of the deceased people displayed prominently on the altar - photographs in ancient China?!!! Perhaps there were time travelers involved in the plot but I didn't catch it."
4,"Old ""Skool Kun Fu!!","I expected big things from this flick,,,but i felt it fell really short. Nontheless this i though it was entertaining. The drunken fights were amazing, and the old school kung fu really plentyful and consistant thoughout the flick!!"
2,worst ever,"this is the worst camcorder i've ever owned.the picture quality is the worst.i can't get a clear picture unless i focus at one distance.if i move a little,or something moves in the picture it goes out of focus.i haven't got one decent video with this piece of garbage yet. i recommend panasonic,it was the last camera i owned and every picture was crystal clear.it's my fault i didn't do my research before i bought this."
2,Terrible camera,"I won this camera in a contest and now I'm kinda wishing I never had. Practically everything I've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another. From the autofocus that can never decide what it wants to focus on, to the very poor image quality in slightly low lighting situations, to the camera recording glitches in the audio when I capture onto my computer. I know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right, but I really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a Canon camera that's not gonna cause you these problems."
3,It wasn`t what I was looking for....,"I bouth this CAM because three qualities:1. Wide screen. It promised me 2.7"" LCD screen, but just it has 1.5""x1.5"" (only in 16:9 wide mode it has 2.7""x1.5""). I have a Sansung i5 camera that really has a 2.5"" LCD screen, and I thouth in this case it was to be the same.2. The remote control. In the tecnical data it says: ""include remote control"". But when i wrote the manual, it said that the remote control is only for SC-D364 and SC-D366 CAM.3. Light for night vision. But light just cover a little distance, and the cuality of the image/video is not good in dart light condition.I`m not satisfy with this produt."
2,Low quality,The camcorder does not have remote control but there is a battery in the box with remote control written on it. You can not copy the recorded movies on the camputer. other than that it is easy to use abd sufficient.
1,"Unfortunately, it did not work.","We have a large ornamental pond with a pool type filtering system. We keep the water clear and chemically balanced and bought this foam insert to filter particulates that may drop in the water. Unfortunately, when we tried to rinse it a week after it was installed, it just simply fell apart. Maybe it will work in a different environment, but for us it was a waste of money - absolutely of no use at."
1,false advertising!,"This item is not the foam pad type filter, it is just the foam pad!! It doesn't say anywhere in the description that this is just filter media. it should be listed as filter media. not as a foam pad external filter."
5,Great reference for the expert or layman.,"Dr. Clark's book is an easy-to-read guide on how to design training according to the five types of content: procedures, factual information, concepts, processes and principles. She clearly defines each type and then explains to the reader how to design learning based on the ""remember level"" (memorization by learner) and the ""apply level"" (application by learner). Dr. Clark gives examples on how to assess each type of content and guides the reader through each chapter with a ""visual"" - a chart which she fills in as the reader progresses through the book.One of the instructional designers at our college is leaving to head the implementation of an online program at another college. I bought her this book as a going-away gift because it is an essential tool for every one who designs learning. This resource should be in every college's, instructional designer's and instructor's library. It is well worth the price."
5,Great Book!,"I know nothing about climbing or mountains, but I was recommended this book as a good read. I had no idea about the history of Everest or about Mallory and Irvine. What a great book! I loved the background and the story about these two great climbers. A great read. I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,Firstbrook and the BBC,"For an account of how Firstbrook and the BBC screwed over the people who put the 1999 expedition together, see the Hemmleb book. I liked the book by Conrad Anker best though."
5,Patriotic Hard Hat a winner,"Shipping took longer than I requested, but the finished product was fantastic. Everyone needs a hard hat like this. Dignitaries love them. We do a lot of ground breakings and ribbon cuttings and these work fantastically."
3,GUERRILLA WARRIOR-The Early Life Of John J. Pershing,"The book is written in a very unorganized manner. The author constantly throughout the book skips from one time period to another in Pershing's life, which leaves the reader the task of connecting the various points together.An historian reading this book will understand the material, and put it to use. A Non-historian will get lost in all the material,and the manner it was written."
5,love it! WELCOME BACK CARTER!,"This is a great CD, just the first track, makes this CD worth Listening to; Girl you left me for.... and it doesn't get worse from there, it only gets better, as she sings ""The story of her life"" to us, with such beauty and grace. One(of the many) things i really like about this album is the roughness in her voice. And she has lyrics and themes in her songs, that she preformes for us with such a hearfeltness... And the songs are lined up perfectly, the sound of each song fit together in the order they are played out, without floating into each other and becomming uninteresting and boring. ONE of the Best CDs so far this year(all though the year is young, i'm sure, the CD will stand out in my mind as one of the best STILL when the year is over.)HOPEFULLY people will give her and this album a chance and give it a try, cause this is an album you'll be sorry you missed."
2,"10 Good Tracks out of 11, Not Bad","I am a Deana Carter fan and I own a number of her albums. Deana has a voice that was not cut using the typical ""cookie cutter"" they use in country music today. BTW, there is very little new country music that I would call good.For the most part, the Deana albums I own are good and were worth the price I paid. But, for ""The Story of My Life"" album I cannot say that. I find 10 of the tracks ok but I do have a problem with track 9 ""Sunny Day"". Deana thanked God for her gift and the album but I do not think He gave her this song. The profanity is hard to take and ruins the song. I like to listen to songs over and over but this one I cannot take. When I copied the album to my iPod I had to unchecked track 9.Deana, you can do better than that!"
1,Not the Deanna Carter I know and love,"I only like two songs on this album, this album is just not Deana Carter, i miss her original stuff. I don't ever listen to this CD either. It sits collecting dust. But you be the judge."
2,Yeh Yeh Yeh...Give me a break!,"I honestly could not get past the annoying first track with that maddening ""yehyehyeh"" splattered throughout the song. I can't imagine anyone over 13 singing along to it. I've tried to like her music over the years, but I just can't get into it -too inconsistent and on this CD, she sounds like a Sheryl Crow wanna-be. If not mistaken, she came out with a CD ""Collection"" after 2 CDs. What's that all about - run out of material? Even her debut CD ""Did I shave my legs..."" was mediocre at best. I bought it for the gimmicky CD holographic cover and the intriguing title, but I don't believe I played that CD more than once."
2,"Loose ""plug in screw""",THis is the second time I ordered this product. I use this to attach a PC Camera to it. Very useful product but it seems to have quality problems? The end screw that bolts into a clamp is a bit loose causing the camera to rotate.
1,great material extremely bad sound quality,"I own more than 300 comedy cds. I am a Jeff Foxworthy fan. This is unfortunately the worst sounding comedy cd I have ever bought (ever worse that Rock's Bigger and Blacker). The sound level goes up and down so at some point you think you are listening to a golf game description and then think you are listening to someone using a megaphone at a protest rally. This happens track after track and deters from enjoying this cd. What I don't understand is if I can fix the problem with a little freeware program I found that copies the tracks and normalizes the sound, why can't the producer or warner brothers do it? And, believe it or not, the cd SKIPS!!! I suggest you either contact the producer of the cd or Warner Bros. and ask them when the correctly produced version of this cd will be re-released and buy it only then."
5,A must for all Foxworthy fans,"Who can resist Jeff Foxworthy and his red neck comedy? It's just good, CLEAN humor and laugh-out-loud fun So.many of us are downsizing and trying to reduce all the clutter in our homes. Foxworthy's CDs fill the bill for an inexpensive gift that's fun to listen to, fun to share, and fun to listen to again. They also don't require building more closets to store like unneeded clothing and ""knick-knacks"" do.WARNING! Do not listen to Foxworthy during the following... 1. Heavy traffic, 2. Dangerous driving conditions or, 3.If you will soon need to use the restroom."
1,Delivery S L O W,"I have no problem with the product, my dissatisfaction is due to the Amazon Prime promise. It took 10 days to receive the order, well after the event I ordered them for was over. I wouldn't pay one extra penny for the Amazon Prime status, and don't understand the benefits of an annual fee for something that takes longer than snail mail. I wasn't happy."
3,If you found this book too dull,"read Elizabeth Wayland Barber's ""Mummies of Urumchi"" instead. It's a great read. She foucses on what we can learn about these people based on (starting from) the textiles the mummies were wrapped in. The result is a fascinating look at a surprising culture. And if you enjoy that, try her earlier book ""Women's Work: the First 20,000 Years"" too."
3,musical talents as soap opera stars,"This is a pretty good biopic about Clara and Robert Schumann, who met when he was studying with her father and becoming a composer. Clara was a piano prodigy, whom Schumann wished to use to promote his music, at least in the eyes of her business manager father. They fall in love, or as much in love as the narcissitic Schumann could be, and blunder into a terrible conflict with Clara's father, who brings a law suit to prevent the marriage. The story is OK and the actors, in particular the wonderfully beautiful Kinski in her prime, are good, but the whole film is presented as a rather idiotic melodrama. By the end, we were practically laughing at it, it had so completely lost us. Still, the music is good, the evocation of the times is fun, and the facts are interesting to know.I would recommend renting this if you really want to see it, as you won't watch it much if you own it."
1,ripped off,I got ripped off .... there were no subtitles availiable or offered on my dvd copy ... shame on you amazon for not letting us knowWell the few minutes I saw looked good anyway
5,The Title Says it All - This Book is All About Hope,"This is one of those amazing books that you can't put down! And although it can easily be read in one sitting, the insights and inspirations will stay with you for a lifetime.In ""Hope"", Joel Rothschild describes his life (his struggles & his joys) since he was diagnosed with full blown AIDS - which was nearly 15 years before the writing of this book! In it, he shares what he's learned about the importance of living each day as if it's your last, as well as how your thoughts have a direct impact on your experiences - ""as a man thinketh, so he is..."".I would highly recommend this book to everyone - it is very uplifting, and has a lot to offer each & every one of us.Thank you Joel for taking the time to write this book!"
2,Not much bang for the buck,"There isn't much you can learn from the book that you can't figure out after playing with the user-friendly Palm for a morning. If you've never used a computer before, you might find this useful, otherwise, leave this one on the shelf."
4,Truly Elo's live presentation.,"GReat live perfomance, with Jeff leading the band, I would recommend this cd!"
4,better-than-average black metal,"Once you get past the disorganized drumming (typical of black metal) you get creative & mellodic all girl metal from Greece! Imagine a riot-grrl version of Borgnagar, early Sirenia and (very) early Moonspell. Here's hoping for a second CD from these lovely ladies!"
5,Train Smart and USE this Book,"After 2 months, I'm inches away from splits in all 3 directions and am confident that another month or 2 will do it. I'm a 36 year-old, long-time martial artist and athlete that has never had this kind of flexibility, not even as a competative gymnast many moons ago. My foot speed, grappling agility and explosiveness have also improved greatly as a direct result of this book's stretching methods.Reading is no substitute for training, but you can apply the information here easily, with little time and effort and make great gains. The book isn't organized perfectly, so I'd encourage you to read and re-read. I've gone over it several times, highlighted it, dog-eared it and still pick up new bits of info. on the next read. If you want to train smart, this is a great resource."
2,"Author knows his topic, but fails to convey content clearly","It is obvious once you are done reading this book that the author has a strong grasp of the science of stretching. There are good stretching techniques mentioned in the book, complete with exercise plans depending on your sport and an Question/Answer section.However, the book reads more like a technical thesis than something intended for a non-medical audience. For a book that is past its third revision, the pictures HAVE to be updated from grainy black-and-white and confusing stick figures. Finally, one can't help thinking less of the author when he peppers his writing with comments that show a lack of understanding of existing martial art stretching techniques.There is much that can be improved in this book. If you don't mind spending the money (it's more expensive than it should be) then you'll find some helpful ideas, but not much more."
2,Not Impressed,"This book explains some things about stretching , puts labels to some things that you might not have had a name for, and reminds you of some stretches that you may not have pulled out and dusted off in a while, but it isn't a great resource if you are looking for a a magic routine. stretching routines, like any other exercise routine, must tell you what to do and when to do it. This book is good for the what, but not so explicit on the when."
5,From a giant wimp to movin like a chimp,I was able to lift 10x the weight of my car and run faster than my house plant but I could never reach the cereal bowls in my kitchen cabinets. With this book I am still unable to reach the bowls and I have a massive debilitating tear in my lower back. This book ROCKS!!!!!
5,Tengo un amigo que reside en Irak,"desde hace cinco años... Yo le regalé este libro la Navidad pasada... y ahora ME DICE QUE DURANTE EL BOMBARDEO, él y su familia no hicieron otra cosa que invocar a estos ángeles...SE SALVARON TODOS, mientras que en la casa de sus vecinos murieron hasta unos visitantes !"
3,Rear wiper for Honda Odyssey...,The wiper is only getting 3 stars based on its fit on our minivan. I bought it based on other mentions and I ended up needing to remove the blade from the frame and install it back on the old blade frame. Performance is ok based on the modified install needed.
2,Poor Don,"Don Dohler, captured on film towards the end of his life, his enjoyment of making these films decades behind him, doing it purely because he needs the money. I feel sorry for him, and the air of sadness which lays across this entire film means it's probably not worth watching."
5,"Great hit, for Jeremy.... goob book for almost every player","OK, this work book is a nice work, Silmas gave some ilustration about some position, and then come the puzzles.Silamn is a International Master, not grand Master, but there are not many grand master who can write a book like Silman.The puzzle are nice, not very dificult, but some puzzles had nice drawback that you fell that this examples improve your skills.I read this book, i have to be honest, i didn't fell huge improve, this kind of book is to practice every day to keep practice chess. And keep active my brain. just for that.For beginer player will learn a lot, about postional skill, maybe this player will taste this book but for an advanced player, buy just for keep training your brain between free time."
2,Very difficult - for advanced players only.,"This workbook seems to be out of the niche that Amateur's mind was intended for. After attempting the first 16 problems and getting none of them right, I needed to have someone explain why my guesses were wrong. I feel like im not learning anything by thinking about a position for 15 min, coming up with my response, and BOOM, what a surprise, im wrong again. I recommend a book that explains the right answer, as well as why some other moves are inferior."
3,great collection of problems,"this book contains 131 complex problems. As i have stated i am not impressed with the main book, but i enjoyed the positions.This book is excellent cos it has so many problems to solve, or rather develop an openion on. The solutions is in my openinon though, not complete at all. The author leaves out many variations and "" roads not taken "". In the variations he does discuss his analysis is also incomplete, and sometime not entirely accurate. I`d give it 5/5 for the problems, but i have to give it 3 cos of the solutions. All in all however, i reccoment it highly to good players who enjoy problems."
3,Don't Let the Stars Fool You,"I'm a novice player and have an intrest in chess. I rate the book with 3 stars because it's a work book. This is a good book if you are willing to WORK. As I play more I find myself going to this book, sitting in front of my set and working thru some of the problems. Good book if you are serious. If you r unsure buy the book set it on the shelf. Play chess, get beat, and find yourself reaching for The Reassess Your Chess Workbook. If you want a quick fix to Chess this is NOT your book. If you want a real understanding of Chess by all means grab a copy!As I continue to learn this book will continue to gain STARS!"
4,The book is a germ,"First,this is the book that all players should own to improve their chess.I would give 5 stars for the contents.The book will teach you how to make plans.There are very rare books on this subjects.There are 400 pages in the book.But there are pictures of masters and grandmasters and the positions printed twice.However,that's not bad."
4,Great product....easy to learn,This remote is great. the instruction manual is very straight forward and tells you all you need to know. The device has most codes for devices already built in but my receiver was not listed. I simply chose the basic screen for a tuner and then let the device learn all of the keys. Very easy to use and definitely has cut down on the clutter on the coffee table.
4,LIKE WHOA!,"This cd is tight but it could be ALOT better. Of course the hit single "" whoa "" is off the chain but I was only feeling like two other songs. I guess I haven't brought a cd in a long time where every song was tight but damn... atleast half of the songs on the album could be decent. But overall this album is WHOA!"
1,NOT WHOA,"THS CD IS WACK, YOU WOULD EXPECT MORE FROM A BADBOY ARTIST. IN NO WAY DOES HE COMPARE TO BIGGIE, LIKE THEY WERE SAYING. ONLY CONTAINS ONE GOOD SONG AND THIS IS ""WHOA"""
1,Junk Machine!,"This answering machine is junk. The sound quality is so poor I am embarrassed to use this machine. When an incoming call is received, my recorded greeting will not activate-the phone will ring several times but the greeting will not answer the call. Yes, I have checked the settings or functions on the machine. Moreover, I bought this machine on the Panasonic name alone. It was a mistake. Look elsewhere for an answering machine, my fellow buyers."
3,Some good some bad,"Good: small, easy to set up, nice features.Bad: won't retain time/date after power failure and cannot be reset remotely, poor sound quality."
2,Once Again Voic Quality Poor,I keep seeking an answer machine with first rate sound quality. This one is not it.
4,Good Read!,"I read this book over the Christmas holiday of 2003. I loved the main character Scarlett, who is very similiar in personailty to her namesake from Gone with the Wind. The book follows Scarlett as she growns from a girl to a women. We follow her as she chases her dream of being a famous writer. I loved Scarlett's ambition, hutzhah (sp?) and fierceness. I didn't really feel that her relationship with the love of her life was persuasive enough for me to get into. Why did Scarlett love a woman who was hardly in her life for most of the book?? That's the reason why I'm only giving this book a 4 out of 5. I wish I would have gotten to know that mysterious love more so that their coming togehter would have been more heartfelt and real. I also would also have enjoyed a bit more love scenes.I do look forward to reading more from Ms. York."
3,Not as expected it,"Well let me tell you why I chose three stars for this novel. First of all I have been looking for lesbian novels and I found this one really interesting under the lesbian categories but sadly when I read it I found three different sexual encounters with men also so because of that I think it is not worth for us to read it unless you skip those pages: 34, 222-223, and 356. If the author did not include those encounters with men and that threesome in this book maybe it would have become one of the good ones. So in general is a good story tender and innocent at first and wild and sad at the end. It is well written and it involves you in a way that you actually want to know what is coming next."
1,Poor Customer Service,I had a question on this product and I couldn't contact the company. I emailed twice with no response and I called and waited on the phone for 40 minutes then was disconnected. I would only buy any product from Oregon Scientific if you are not going to care if it works or not because the customer service is non existent.
3,Light weight,"It's good book for someone with light to moderate fear issues, but doesn't seem to have enough substance to help those with deep set fear and anxiety."
4,A very useful and inspiring read,"This book is a good resource for those struggling with anxiety and depression. Another great resource for facilitating personal transformation and overcoming anxiety, anger and other forms of emotional stress is mindfulness. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
4,Very Good,"Great book and good way to understand how to manage your anxieties and fears. This book will not make your fears go away, but rather enable you to work with them. A pratical approach."
5,Amazing!!!,"This book is fantastic. She is funny, yet insighful. I honestly hat ""self help"" books. However, this is not one of those. She is smart, fun, and put your anxiety into something almost tangible to tackle."
5,Great Book,"Not a self help book in my opinion though. Its good for identifying different emotions so later on, when you are experiencing them, you know what it is that your feeling, and hopefully be better able to respond in spite of those negative emotions."
5,Corney Greatness,"I love both of these movies. Though the plot is lagging and the acting can sometimes be painful, these movies are classic! The only thing that saves North Shore is Turtle. The movie was priced just right and Came right on time!!!"
5,AWSOME DVD's for the fitness buffs and the bellydancers.,Repetition is the mother of PERFECTION....here Michelle offers different perspectives in movement and mechanics of dance for both types of audiences. This is the best DVD for people who like CLEAR and DETAILED instruction not like other teachers who are muddy in their technique....you FEEL like Michelle is in your living room giving you a private belly dance lesson. As a belly dance teacher myself for 9 and 1/2 years I would recommend this DVD for any beginning dancer in any dance field OR to ladies at home who want to firm up those flabby areas. ENJOY!
4,beginning bellydancing,I feel this is a great video for those just beginning to bellydance. The only downfall would be that you cant forward to different sections. You have to watch it virtually all the way through even if you only want to practice a certain move
4,Good Work Out,"This video was listed as a beginners...that should be clarified that it is for beginner belly dancers...the workout involved in the video was tough on this out-of-shape beginner, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Exercising should be fun and this is."
4,Perfect For Those With Two Left Feet!,"This video is great for those lacking coordination-the reason I state this is, the cuing is great and the moves are explained in detail. Also, what NOT to do is explained. I will use this video and improve coordination and tone up!!!"
2,"buy this one or Michelle's Basics, not both!","I bought this video because I had liked Michelle's other videos (Basic lesson and drum solo), however I was totally disappointed when I watched it. This video presents exactly the same material as in the other 2 but shortened! What a rip-off...I wish this had been mentioned, that's why I gave it only 2 stars. The material itself is quite good for serious learners of belly dance."
4,Worth the money,"At first Michelle is kind of intimidating, the warm up is a little fast to begin with but she definately knows what she's doing.You can tell she is also a personal trainer. I like the open dance studio look with a mirror behind her so her, you feel like your are at a lesson. The only 2 things I didn't like is in one part she's talking to the mirror and the cool down leaves quite a bit to be desired. All in all it was a great work out. I can feel my thighs and abs working the whole time and my heart got going. If you want a more toned down and informative video Amira's Bellydance 101 is also a great choice."
2,disappointed once again,"I have taken Belly Dance classes, which have been much more engaging, fun, and well-done than this DVD. The woman in this video seems to know what she is doing and is pleasant, she's just fine, but the moves and boring, lengthy repetition were quite disappointing. I was so excited to use this video, but I decided to pay for another class at the YMCA and won't be using this DVD.The very worst thing, that I find quite deceptive, is that a great deal of the footage on this DVD and the one titled ""Belly Dance Basics"" are exactly the same - they are the same footage. I feel ripped off with this."
1,Worst belly dance video ever!,"First of all, from the very start the video was chopped up and confusing. The workout segments wouldn't raise the heart rate of a 90 year old and the whole thing was a complete failure. What it really looks like is a bored house wife with very little belly dance expertise who wanted to make a video. I feel completely ripped off!"
1,SUCKS!,"I received a defective DVD - the thing was stuck on the intro and just played the same song, over and over. I returned it for exchange and received yet ANOTHER one, with the same problem. I attempted to play both of these on more than one machine and got the same (non)results. Retirned for refund and will not order from this seller again."
3,Very good!,"The class is actually very good, I felt it working in my belly right away, very easy, and my husband has no complains! ;)The only bad thing is that my copy skips quite a bit."
1,Better Belly Dance workouts available,"I find this dvd very boring. There is no flow to the exercise section, just individual segments. I usually end up forwarding through much of the dvd because I find the music annoying & I don't like how the instructor spends so much time breaking down the moves. That is fine when you are just learning but not when you have already watched it a couple of times & just want a good, fun workout. I don't really like her outfit as she seems to spend too much time adjusting her pants so we can see what her legs & feet are doing. I much prefer the video tape (yes, a tape) I have by Veena & Neena Bidasha. I have had that tape for years & still work out to it. I still get a burn in my shoulders & arms. I am going to purchase an actual dvd of their before my video tape dies..."
4,great for beginners,it is everything I learned in beginning belly dancing. The title says it all. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to start belly dancing
1,DVD wouldn't play,"As someone else has written about this product, the DVD wouldn't play. It would play the song over and over, but I was unable to click on any of any of the titles to get the workout started. I am overseas now so I can't return it."
2,Totally Unoriginal,"Having been on 23 cruises and very familiar with many of the cruiselines and ships reviewed, I have to say that the last few editions as well as the present publication of this guide book are very disappointing..The ship descriptions are often inaccurate or carbon copies of other reviews for similar ships in the same class..There is also a lot of bias in reviews of certain ships falsly attacking aspects of certain ships from their amenties to the personality of the crew...There is a definate lack of research apparant in many of the reviews.. The book seems to be written by a man who's attitude is quite pretentious and unrealisitic for any person experienced or inexperienced to cruising.. Therefore, I would not recommend this book as a guide for anyone who wants to try cruising as the opinions and the ratings are not trustworthy, and are written from a very negative and overly critical, often exagerated point of view."
1,Pretty Bad Book Overall.,"I got this one for my son before his first class. It is really awful. I enrolled him so he could learn to fight. To protect himself from bullies. He got nothing out of the reading and the concepts were not condusive for teaching a kid to protect himself. It really seemed more like a book on how to become and absolute wimp. I don't know what world this guy lives in, but it isn't this one, where signs of real qweakness just get you beat down. What a collosal waste of money that was."
5,"More, more, more...","Just finished the fourth of this magical saga of adventures and I cannot wait to purchase the next couple of tomes! Once again suspense crawls with a slow and patient pace, characters are resuscitated from Velázquez's canvases, the narrative borrows conspicuously Cervantine sketches, and the action episodes sprawl spontaneously with diminutely described fencing and brawling scenes. Do Pérez-Reverte's books get published in English? Such Spielbergesque epic is worth its circulation in one too many a tongue."
5,Variety is key,"Why do so many many people rave on and on about how good this soundtrack is? Because of the excellent songs and the amazing variety of talent. Heck you go from moshing with Pantera to falling asleep with Jane Siberry, add in my favorite Cure song (Burn) sprinkle a dab of violent Femmes (what a great song!), too many great songs to name 'em all. Listen there's at least something for every rock fan here and you'll discover some great music by bands you've probably never heard of before, for example: For Love not Lisa's Slip Slide Melting, you have got to hear it. So take my advice get this one now, perfect for any day of the week, rain or shine."
4,Graeme Revell at his best,"Like most of the people who took part in creating the Crow, Graeme Revell was also given carte blanche with his orchestration. A haunting, yet at times romantic score, Revell taps into the theme of The Crow at its very core. His transitions from dark to light, hope to despair are fluid and wondrous. Unfortunately Revell is yet to top the quality of this score with any of his more recent films, but I look forward to the next time he is given this type of freedom again"
4,Awesome,"I thought it was great. Nine Inch Nails is my favorite band and they have my favorite song on here. I was impressed Nine Inch Nails soundtrack song was good as some of their album songs. Unlike most bands, they didn't lower in quality for ""just a soundtrack"". The other songs were cool not to forget. Of course the movie was good too."
5,one for the goth side,I love this cd. I actually bought it before I saw the movie. I listen to it all the time and never get tired of it. It's a definite tribute to Brandon Lee and the the awesome movie.. a must have for any goth-songs ranging from sad and meloncholic to upbeat and powerful and never losing the true feeling..
2,hmmmm,"well in my oppinion the rock did not stand up to the expectations, not to mention that the main theme is completely missing. Save your money, if you ask me..."
3,Sounds of Crow,"The music on this CD are from the original movie titled, 'The Crow.' The music is dark and somewhat tells a story that seems to follow the mood of the movie rather closely. On the soundtrack, I found that I personally like some of the songs more than others. I do however, recommend this CD for anyone that enjoyed the movie, or that just likes a hint of darker sounding music."
5,innkredible,"this album is incredible, i got it years ago, it's always in heavy rotation with me. it has some of my fav bands (The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against The Machine, Pantera) i reccomend it to anyone who likes tha movie, and anyone who likes good music :)"
5,love it,"I already adore this movie, and I love the music. I got this CD for my significant other, and he loves it. I love it as well and we listen to it all the time. It has a great mix of songs from the film. If you are a Crow fan, you should own this CD."
3,Seriously...,"The ""Soundtrack"" for this movie is okay, because it's comprised of songs from the film...and isn't a soundtrack supposed to consist of MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE AND ONE OR TWO SONGS THAT PLAY OVER THE CREDITS? I really like the first track. I DO NOT like the rap tracks on this album, the heavy metal stuff is okay, but could have been cut. The only other track i really like is number 8."
2,Average Music Great Film,After watching The Film which I enjoyed Alot I Got this Disc&wasn't Nearly as Impressed.The Material for me didn't really go with the film.I Bet the Score is better?I Like The Violent Femmes Color me once the best.
4,A decent starter CD for Yes,"This is a decent collection of songs from Yes to give you a broad view of their sound from the early 70s to the 80s. Personally, I am a big fan of the prog rocking sound of Yes and believe that is where their true roots lie. Seeing as that their newer studio albums ""The Ladder"" and ""Magnification"" returns back to their older style, I don't see why so many people get up in arms when people bash their 80s material. Yes is really acknowledged for being one of the pioneering progressive rock groups. The fact that they made some 80s pop tunes was to survive during an extreme change in musical tastes. I recommend for people who want to hear more of the older Yes to spend a little extra on the 35th Anniversary Edition, since this collection doesn't even cover anything past Big Generator. But again, this is a nice little collection to get a basic idea of Yes' overall sound."
2,No,"There are a number of reasons why I do not like this album. First off, no Roger Dean cover art. Next, a peculiar song selection...their most commercially successful songs are not necessarily their best or conform to the Yes concept. Finally, too wide of a time frame covered. Their best period was the Fragile-Close To The Edge era. Buy those two instead for a much greater Yes experience. We don't have heaven, here."
2,Diluted,"This CD covers too long of a time span and glosses over some of their finest material. A more appropriate introduction would be Classic Yes, Yesyears, or the original albums Close to the Edge or Yessongs. Also, compared to the Roger Dean artwork, this cover is abrupt, to say the least."
3,???,"I wonder whose idea was 2 put Starship Trooper and Owner of a lonely heart onto 1 CD. Or I could say I've seen all good people and Leave It. Different music from different periods, only the group is the same. Yes should separate the work before 90125 and after, and a new best of CD should come up with hits from the Rabin-era. It is not easy 2 make a very best CD from their early material, where many of their best songs were 15-20 minutes long. Leave this very best and get their albums instead. Again: I give the 3 stars 4 the whole album, of course, every song on this is a 5."
2,Two Great Songs,"There are only two songs that are worth my time listening to: The funky-spunky ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" and the lesser known but driving glam-rock styled ""Rythm of Love."" I wish the rest of the songs on this CD approached the level of energy, intensity, and driving groove that these two songs have to offer. Maybe I'd have been better off buying one or two of their later albums. Strangly, I am glad I bought this CD, especially since I recorded a section of the guitar intro to ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" onto my Wakeyoo alarm clock to wake me up in the morning. However, this is not one of those albums I'll be reaching when I just want to listen to music. It's one of those specialty albums that I'll only occationally pull out when I have the craving to hear one of those two songs, and as a stylistic reference for my own musical creations."
1,"Yes, I regret it.","""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" is not a reason to buy this album. I did and regret it. The catchy tune from years gone by inticed me to buy the album. If you also like that song do yourself a favor and just download that one."
2,Not even a good starting point for Newcomers.,"I'm possibly the biggest Yes fan around, I enjoyed all their incarnations, and like Genesis, Yes were an ALBUM GROUP, THEREFORE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPILE THEM PROPERLY.I can't believe there's only 2 songs off 90125, why not include ""Hold on"", It Can Happen"", ""Changes"", ""Our Song"", ""City Of Love"" and the GRAMMY AWARD WINNING instrumental ""Cinema""?""The very best of Yes"" paints a WOEFULLY INCOMPLETE PICTURE of a prolific band. You'd be doing yourself a grave disservice by not picking up the individual albums, which I recommend instead."
1,PEOPLE BE REASONABLE,"I have nothing against greatest hit collections. However, a band like Yes is not a ""singles"" band. Yes, yes they did have hit singles but it wasn't something contrived or planned. Yes has CD's which take you on a musical journey. You can have favorite songs but to make a compilation of songs is like loping off a long distance runner's right foot because it is the dominant foot. Silly when you look at it that way isn't it. Like Jethro Tull, Yes was never a singles band. Buying this CD cuts you off from such beautiful musical landscapes that Yes created for you to hear in its entirety, not in bite sized pieces."
4,"A good introduction, or all the Yes the casual fan needs","If you love the bombastic Yes singles that you hear on the classic rock station, but just can't get into the extended compositions on the albums, then this collection ought to do the trick for you. The hits are here; the few obscurities are well-chosen; and the duds (like from off of _Tormato_) are avoided. This stripped-down setting portrays the band's truly amazing instrumental virtuosity to all the better effect. It also testifies to their durability, tracing their career from late '60s mysticism, high baroque art-rock, to MTV pop smarts. This is only a part of Yes' career, but if the singles are the part that interest you, this is the disk to get."
1,The pink color does not stay!,This fades in the sun or should I say darkens. It is now black flowers. Not very pretty anymore.
5,A Must Read For Mothers and Their Beautiful Daughters,"I was astonished to find a lot of answers to questions my six year old daughter asks in this book. I make the answers age appropriate; however, she truly gets a clear picture with the writers' stories and analogies. My little girl loves stories. I take daily lessons from each chapter I read and apply them to her character development. Girls are becoming more inquisitive at younger ages. With scriptures from the Bible readily available, I can teach my girls how to carry themselves as ladies, and how important it is not to follow the world's views on girlhood. It's never too early for parents with daughters to pick up this book and read it. It will prepare you for raising strong, thoughtful, courteous, and obedient girls."
5,A wonderful companion guide to complement Beautiful Girlhood,Beautiful Girlhood is such a sweet and innocent celebration of a girl's life inspiring girls and their moms as they begin to grow from girls to young women. The companion guide to Beautiful Girlhood is an added blessing to enhance the mother/daughter relationship as moms seek to encourage their daughters and teach them timeless values and character they so desire them to develop. The language is quaint and reminiscent of days gone by which adds to the charming appeal of the message. Biblical character and virtue are unchanging and so the themes of this book are timeless. The questions are thought provoking and provide a spring board for treasured conversation between moms and daughters. I highly recommend this guide to complement Beautiful Girlhood.
2,Not as good as it looks !,"I bought this item recently on March 2007, about a month later the pump stopped working.... To my opinion, this is not a good product .. Don't buy this, search other brands instead !"
2,corny!,"I really enjoyed Confederate Railroad's first CD and I couldn't wait for this to be released. When it finally was I rushed out to buy. That was my first mistake. I then listened to it and found it to be a huge disappointment. The witty, tongue-in-cheek southern humor was replaced by cheesy stupid songs like Elvis and Andy along with move over Madonna. Do yourself a favor and limit your CRR purchases to their 1st CD you won't be disappointed!"
2,A big dissapointment,"Boring presentation. This is not a guide you will return to. Just a guy creating projects and lots and lots of video of him using his saw. Sure to kill your desire to use your saw. Buy a book instead, any book would be better. There would be a long list of the things he does not cover and a very short list of the things he does, but I can't remember one."
4,A good book to challenge why you believe the way you do!,"Tony challenges the reader to critically analyze why they hold certain opinions. In doing so, he makes you think about aligning your faith with political/social belief systems."
5,A book for all.,Don't let the title keep you from buying this book. Only one chapter is on the title. Tony ask and answers questions that many are afraid to even look at. I recomend to all.
1,Who reads this stuff?,"Who would read this stupid book? Jesus is a deity. He isn't registered for any political party, and if he was you could just look him up and find out, and what about all of the other political parties, like socialist, Fascist, Communist, Liberal, Whig, Federalist, Nazi, Libertarian, and countless others. However he isn't registered for any of them either. I guess you could say that he's independent. However everyone knows that his ideals are more along the line of the extreme right wing."
5,My favorite paper for dye based printers,This is my go-to paper for dye-based canon printers such as the canon i9900. Great color reproduction with the free downloadable profiles from ilford's website.
1,Marketing on the Internet,"i seen that other people had good marks to say about this book, and one had adverse things to say about it, take my advise either borrow it from a friend, or look at a salvage book store, save your money, give it to charity!"
2,all aboard train journeys vol 1,"Not what I was looking for, but if you love trains and want to know the nuts and bolts of them, this is for you!"
2,Defective tape,"Unfortunately, one of the two tapes was defective and does not work. I did not return it as the postage cost would exceed the value of the tape."
5,You want to win more tennis matches? Read this book.,"A great, gritty, compelling look at what it really takes to play tennis. We're not just talking technique, we're talking about what it takes to be a winner -- before, during and after matches. Filled with great anecdotes and insights into the game's great players (and near-greats), Fox has crafted a book guaranteed to improve your appreciation and talent at this exceptionally mental game. Joel Drucker"
2,Clichés piled on clichés. An author in search of an editor,"This guy never met a metaphor or simile he didn't love to death. Seriously tortured, belabored, ridiculous, overwrought images get in the way of the story. Some truly ludicrous tough-guy patter that is at times simply nonsensical. Perhaps the worst use of a potentially colorful setting. Grew up near Detroit which in the 60s and 70s was truly on life support - a city dying right before ones eyes, but the author simply tags various intersections and adds a few over-the-top descriptions of the snow or rain or wind or whatever. A great mystery writer uses his setting effectively - it becomes a ""character"" in the book, and Detroit deserves better - esp. since it's the title ""character."" If I'd paid more than 99 cents, I'd feel cheated. At 99 cents, I just feel like I wasted some time."
2,Over hyped,"Bought some Diamond 8.2's a few months back. After listening to them with all different types of music and also playing them to friends and family the response was rather negative. These speakershave a really boomy bass, at some points it was hard to distinguish other sounds over it. I tried turning it up and at points the vocal became disorted and shrill, it also sound very flat and 2 dimensional.When played at low, easy listening levels the musical details are lost by the silk dome tweeter and its overly tame driver.I dont use these any more as i have bought myself some Bose but i would not recommend them to anyone except those on a very tight budget who are not so fussy about sound quality."
1,Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce,"I received this unit for Christmas along with a Sunpak 383 flash. So far I have not been able to use it because the black gizmo that holds the filter won't slide onto the flash unit. The plastic is too thick to fit into the groove in the flash. Hopefully, my husband will be able to cure this problem in the shop--however, a unit that was supposed to fit the flash should fit it when received."
4,The problem lies in that:,"After releasing and buying all of those albums and cd's they've cluttered up my life and they were better live than in the studio so who needs all 10 albums all over again. Stairway to Heaven was not in my opinion the greatest song ever revorded by them because they have so much material and it's been overplayed and gets tiring after awhile. Just my opinion, yours will be different. $65 bucks for 10 cd's that I've heard before?Yet I still love listening to them anyway."
5,allmusic.com review,"One of the most phenomenal music collections ever released. Listening to it in a relatively short period of time will ensure a breathtaking response and the recognition that what the Zep accomplished in less than a decade remains one of the greatest achievements in rock and roll history.After listening to this 10-CD set, I decided to see what allmusic.com had to say. Get this...they gave it 3 out of 5 stars, which is on par with, say a mediocre Barry Manilow record. I'll stick with Amazon reviewers who clearly know a supremely eminent recording when the hear one."
5,Worth It's Weight In Gold,"This set is perfect for everyone: if you are new to Led Zeppelin, you should buy the set if you don't exactly know how to start digesting the music because it will save you lots of money. Secondly, the remstr on these discs are fantastic.The only downside to the set is that there are no lyrics, something that can be rather tedious if you are a lyrics freak like myself...The set contains all ten of the band's releases from 1969 to 1982 (Coda) and a nice bit of liner notes written by Cameron Crowe. It is one heck if a set, a huge bargain and a must have for any fan, be you a veteran or novice."
5,led zep's definitive compilation,"this is as good as a box set can get.you get all the big hits of this great rock band like black dog,whole lotta love,dazed and confused,stairway to heaven,achilles last stand and trampled underfoot all in one compilation which is very well worth your money.i have had this compilation sice the last 3 months and still listen to this everyday.very highly recommended."
4,A really great Box Set,"I have to say I thought alot about getting this box set before the purchase. I have most Led Zeppelin on Vinyl or the original CD issues. This box set is well made and I love the design. The booklet included is cool and offers some insight but is mostly just a fun read. The cds played through my Rega Apollo Cd player sound pretty good... Although I have to say there is much distortion in the first 3 cds. I am not sure if this is from the remastering or if it is found on the original source tapes due to poor mic placement in the studio. Overall the box set is worth getting for the price and the ""cool"" factor."
5,Led Zeppelin Studio Recordings,"There are so many great songs, I am happy I bought the entire collection, they are one of the greatest groups ever. I recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,One of the Best BOx Sets in Rock History,"This is one of the best box sets I have ever purchased. It contains all of the studio recordings Led Zeppelin has put out over their thirty year career. I would recommend this to someone who is a hardcore fan that truly appreciates Led Zeppelin and their music. This ranks #2 in my book next to Pink Floyd's box set ""Oh by the way"". The other great feature about this box set is that has a book and an essay written about Led Zeppelin and their legacy. Great band, great box set, great buy!"
5,Reamstered sound is worth it,"Everyone knows that Led Zep's albums are classic and fans probably own all their cds. However, this box set is worth purchasing because of the remastered sound. The improved sound quality makes these songs jump out of your cd player! Buy it and enjoy a new Led Zeppelin experience."
5,Psychic Geography...,"Led Zeppelin -- Messers Page (producer, studio rat, tasteful axe virtuoso), Plant (siren-wailing diva, front man extrordinaire), Jones (bassist-arranger -- those suite-like song structures are his doing), and Bonham (Thor the thunder-god reincarnated as a drummer, irreplaceable): these four men, in the years 1968-1980, located a place familiar to blues aficionados: a crossroads. But it was a crossroads hitherto unknown. The place they led us to was the intersection of Marrakesch, Salisbury Plain (that's Stonhenge, y'all), and the Mississipi Delta. They took us to the place where the muezzin, the druid, and the bluesman lock horns, and dragged us down every step on their stairway to hell. ""When the Levee Breaks"" will take you there, as will ""Kashmir."" This is the stuff..."
5,Sorely tempted to buy this,"But I have a question: why aren't the bonus tracks listed? I was given to understand that ""Travellin' Riverside Blues"", ""Hey, Hey, What Can I Do"" and a previously unpublished track were included in the boxed set but they're not in the track listing. What gives? I think I'd need those extra tracks in the set in order to buy it."
5,Nothing short of staggering,"Jimmy Page...what more need one say? A powerful reminder of the butt-kicking impact and influence the mighty Led Zeppelin had on rock in general. Having seen Zeppelin a number of times between 1970 and 1975, there is no doubt in my mind that these guys are second to none. It has been said in the past that ""Clapton is God"", another artist I have seen many times; in truth and fact that title belongs to Jimmy Page. Buy this full boxed set--you will not be sorry."
4,Praise God,"First of all I truly thank God for Led Zeppelin because they have brought many a great evening of listening enjoyment. Second of all I really must admit that I would have honestly rather purchased all of these cds seperatley. It is an attractive set but it is rather annoying to have the cds slip into the artwork like they do. I don't believe anyone can compain about the selection of cds themselves at all. Not only do you get every studio album but you also receive several rare bonus tracks that did not come on their regular issue cds. In all seriousness though, if I had to do it all over again I would have purchased them all seperatly although it would have cost approximatly double the money to go that route. All the nice artwork and pics may sway you to go for this box set though. God bless you all!"
5,Christmas gift for my Dad,"This was a gift from my mom and I to my dad and he couldn't have been happier! He not only loved the total collection of music, but the mini book included."
5,Doesn't Get Better Than This!,"I was a Led Zeppelin fan since the vinyl LP days. I've been wanting to replace my collection with all new CDs - I finally did it - and with a single purchase. You don't get the live recordings, but every studio recording required by a true Zeppelin fan is here - including ""Hey Hey What Can I Do.""How could you not buy this? How could I have waited so long to get this? I would have given this a 10 Star, but 5 was max. on this scale!"
5,good good,"Ok, of course the box set is great. If you like Led Zeppelin you like the set. Just gotta wonder about those people who didn't give it 5 stars. If you don't like Led Zeppelin, don't buy a Led Zeppelin box set. I would've thought that to be obvious."
3,ZEPPELIN STUDIO SET GOES FLAT,"Only thing good about this box set is the packaging and design and so on. However the booklets the CDs come infall apart easly and some of the disc come pre-scratched as they fit too tight.As for the recordings, Jimmy said it well, they again are flat sounding.Too bad the Mothership wasn't a complete box set, tracks are clean and clear!"
2,"There are some noise in ""The house of the holy"" CD",The House of the holy CD in Led Zeppelin Boxset hasdefect in track no. 8(the ocean)It's innate noise because there is no scratch in the surface of CDThe noise last about 10 second.Another problem is that the glue of sleeve can damage the CD. And It's hard to take out CD from sleeve.
5,The Best Rock Band Ever.,Led Zeppelin was the greatest ever. If you're wondering why you should buy this album you are asking the wrong question. What you should be asking is: Why haven't I already bought this album.
5,Led Zeppelin for the win!,"Led Zeppelin, in my opinion: gods of rock. Complete studio recordings (and Coda with some different tracks) comes in a nice box with a little booklet as well. Not a lot to say other than incredible music. A must have for any fan who wants to each CD. Also, all original artwork which is a nice addition and definitely one of my favourite things about the box set."
2,A real snoozefest,"What the hell is so great about Stairway To Heaven? It's really only popular in North America, which kind of shows that it's actually more of a cultural phenomenon that a great song.On a related note, what the hell is so great about any of Led Zeppelin's stuff?.Sure, they inspired heavy rock to a degree, but later bands have done what Led Zeppelin did heavier , louder and better.I think that people (especially in North America) have been so conditioned into thinking that Led Zeppelin are good ,that actually coming to terms with the fact that they are actually quite mediocre would be more than their poor hearts could stand."
5,Led Zep One Stop,"The first album I ever purchased was Physical Graffiti, This collection is clearer, cleaner and a one stop shop to immerse yourself in Led Zep... Gone but not forgotten"
3,Second opinion please?,"I tried this on a whim, picked it up at my local supermarket, and I think it tastes almost exactly like Pei-Wei's ""blazing noodle sauce"". Maybe it needs Oyster sauce or black pepper, but it is very close, agreed?"
5,amazing song.....such a turning point in pop!,"i saw the video for ""Out Of Your Mind"" when I was on a summer trip in Ireland, and i was absolutely breathtaken. I was already aware of this song, from being a spice girls fan. I fell in love with the song, and the day it came out, I had to snatch up a copy ..., and I still listen to it non-stop, and now i am a huge fan of Truesteppers. It's a must have, I recommend it highly."
4,solid breakbeat/dance track from former spice girl.,"It's quite interesting how truesteppers cut the breaks on this track, and they do it rather fashionably (almost steps into the IDM subgenre of electronic music). However, the only thing I think is a bit overdone is the use of the vocoder and vocal effects. Victoria can sing, and it would be nice to hear her perform a solo without the interference. Although not as seemingly popular as a dance track as Mel C's I turn to you (which is an exceptional tune but was practically played to death on the airwaves), it stands apart from the overflowing amount of commercial dance garbage."
4,Posh spice - out on her own,Victoria happens to be the lead vocals of the new TrueStepper single 'Out Of Your Mind'. If your worried that is is just gonna be another Wannabe - don't panic.This is a dance / club track that features Dane Bowers from ex boyband 'Another Level'. You'd be surpirsed to hear how Posh sounds now.The remiexes on the single are incrediable. They are really dancey and have powerful beats. If you think tha Posh Spice never got sing a line on any of the Spice Girl singles/albums - shes been saving herself for this single.
2,I'm not too crazy about this book or author.,"This book wasn't so bad that I stopped reading, I just didn't enjoy it much. It was kind of stupid, for lack of a better term. I didn't care about the characters, I had it figured out early on, and I like characters to be somewhat smart. Jake does the dumbest things! You know someone with average intelligence wouldn't do those things and I can't handle a dumb man! Just saying! I deleted all Paul Levine books off my Kindle. They are just not worth my time."
5,Humorous and cleverly written,"One of the few books I've read recently that I felt compelled to continue, reading late into the night. Written in the first person, I was reminded of old gum-shoe noir books. Courtroom scenes are handled in a humorous manner, with judges that look to the press before making rulings or make horse-racing bets from the bench. Well worth the asking price of $2.99."
4,To Speak for the Dead......unusual killing methods.....enticing read,"To Speak for the Dead by Paul Levine is a Jake Lassiter novel. Jake Lassiter, a defense attorney, takes on the case of defending Roger Stanton, a noted surgeon, who is accused of killing his patient and friend, Phillip Corrigan. Phillip Carrigan is a multi-millionaire with a beautiful ""trophy"" wife named Melanie.In trying to defend Roger, Jake uncovers unusual ways how people, who were connected past and present with Melanie and Roger, were killed. Jake goes through civil and criminal trials defending Roger. The process of fact finding and getting to the bottom of who murdered whom held me in limbo to the conclusion of the novel.A good legal thriller that will keep you on edge. A good read."
1,bad news,after reading a few pages boredom set in as this book is not of the caliber of other jake books. it lacks any credulity and originality. same old same old stuff you eyeballs will be rolling back in your head after a couple of pages
1,"Sadly, not recommended","I say ""sadly"" because the author shows some flashes of greatness, with features of levity similar to Elmore Leonard and detail similar to Michael Connelly.However, for a non-fantasy book to be good it has to be at least somewhat believable and this one is so ridiculous at times on legal grounds, medical grounds, and martial arts grounds, not to mention just common sense, that it is more pitiful than even laughable.I find it inexplicable that the author does enough research to know what a rongeur is but not an aneurysm, and with many similar examples throughout the book.It really is a shame that the author didn't refine this into something much better."
2,Ludicrous.,"I gave this book a second star ONLY because I wanted to find out what happened enough to read to its end. And for Tyrone Hambone Washington.Otherwise, it was unbelievable, no matter what ""Lady Trial Lawyer"" claims. No prosecutor would go to trial based on merely the word of a woman who could have planted the alleged murder weapon and who had already sued the alleged murderer for malpractice. If he or she did, no competent lawyer would fail to ask when and where the accuser met the accused, i.e., when she was stripping and giving lap dances in a strip bar. Nor do judges wait until the middle of a trial to rule on whether certain evidence is admissable.It's also unbelievable that a person who hears the gruesome and painful details of a loved one's death from a ""friend"" would continue to consider that person a friend.Maybe that's just me. But the rest of it simply doesn't hold up. Not recommended for the well-informed."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING AND I'M NOT EVEN HALF WAY THROUGH,"It seems to be a little disappointing. They skipped views in the beginning of the book. It went from Katherine's point of vew to other people's point of view. Not my favorite way of reading books. I like to stay consistent all throughout the whole book. I don't know how the rest is going to turn out, but its not one of my favorites. I recommend John Edward's book called After Life: Answers From The Other Side. That was more touching to me than this one was. But everyone has a different opinion."
1,Terrible At Best,"If John Edward were not all ready somewhat of a celebrity this book would of never been published. It is BORING at best. It rambles at times. The plot is all over the place. Obviously he has a lot of devoted fans, as anyone with even a two digit IQ would describe this terrible at best."
5,Another Hit!,"This was a real page turner, I finished it in two sittings. John Edward is a wonderfully talented writer and this book tells a beautiful story."
1,"Do What You Do Best, John","It's funny how actors want to be singers and singers want to be actors. John is great at what he does. Natasha, I'm not so sure about. Ok, it's her fifth collaboration but that doesn't mean they were all good. I felt I was reading an 8th grader's book report: cliche's abound, settings are boring, dialog untrue to life and need I go on? Her blonde hair, neat name and green eyes might have helped if she could only write. John doesn't need any help; try his other books but skip this one."
1,"Please stick to non-fiction, John",Two of us read this book and we were both disappointed. Characters are depressing and annoying. The storyline is predictable. We both loved John's two last books but fiction is not his forte. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Disappointing,"As much as I hate to say this, because I love John Edward, this book was terrible from a literary standpoint. It had no character development, no plot that held up. The dialogue was really bad. I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. It probably would make an acceptable movie of the week, but that's about it. To be fair, I haven't read any of his earlier books, but maybe he should just stick to what he does on his tv show. And if the book was mainly written by Natasha Stoyoff, he should dump her. I really try to go by the saying, ""don't say anything if you can't say anything nice"", but I was really disapointed by this book. Even though, gotta love John Edward!"
3,"great book, his first was the best though","Good book. If you like this one I recomend John Edward's first novel, What if God were the Sun? It's even better than this one but very different. This book was very good and an interesting read."
2,Not very powerful,The battery life is about what you expect and mechanically the machine works well. The problem with this machine is the power. It really doesn't have enough power to adequatly till the ground unless the ground is pretty mushy in the first place.For two years I've tried to use this tiller and after a 1/2 hour or less I end up pushing it aside and just using my hand tiller or my shovel.I would strongly recomend anyone thinking of buying a tiller to spend a little more money and get something that will work more effectively.
3,MY rating,Batteries run out quickly and it takes 12 hrs to recharge. overall- the product worked well. would have been better if it came with one spare battery.
1,Total junk,"This thing is a total POS, Unless you beds are topspil straight from the bag dont waste your money. It will not remove any weeds at all, even the really small ones. I would give it 0 stars but they make me give it at least 1"
5,Makes gardening fun!!,"My husband had doubts about the power of a cordless cultivator but got one for me anyway to see if it worked. He was amazed (as I was too) that it worked just great and made short work of a long weeding job that was way overdue. I've been telling everyone who will listen how great this product is. Now I'm actually looking forward to finding some more weeds I can ""destroy"" with my new found weapon. It's just fantastic and I'm so glad we took a chance on it."
4,Easy on the back,"This cultivator was very easy to assemble. It reduces back strain because you use it standing up.Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Garden Cultivator #GC818Handles are comfortable, feels safe and stable in my hands. It works well in rather hard soil, and displaces the weeds making them easier to pick up. I have never run out the charger while using the device. It would help if the battery holder would show a green light when it is fully charged. Overall I like it"
1,NOT FOR UNDISTURBED SOIL,"I tried the machine in undisturbed soil the day after a heavy rain when the soil was softer. Trying to work at a depth of several inches, the machine was slow, the torque was insufficient, and the battery lasted about 20 minutes. Might be OK for an existing garden that previously required a gas tiller."
1,A simple hoe is much easier to use,"Bought this at Lowes after reading the reviews here. Completely useless for tilling or removing weeds, even in soft dirt. I don't understand the favorable ratings...this simply does not work effectively and a simple hoe would finish more quickly and with less physical effort."
3,Battery life is short,The battery only lasted about an hour after an 18 hour charge.I would recommend buying a second battery for backup.Our soil is very hard and rocky and this cuts through it.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Have to admit that I bought this on a whim. Wasn't sure what I was getting but, like I said, I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it. It had more power than I had originally given it credit. (If it had had just a little more power I would have rated it that fifth star.) The ease at which it churned up the dirt was wonderful. I wouldn't recommend this tool for large areas by any means, but for the small patches of ground I have in my yard it did well. It was easy to handle, seemed to hold it's charge the several hours I worked and overall made my time managing my garden that much more enjoyable. Definitely worth the money."
3,Black and Decker Garden Cultivator,This product did what it claimed....to an extent. It worked fine in garden soil that had been previously loosened by other means. But it really didn't perform too well in impacted soil. It would work fine in garden beds in which you only need to incorporate fertilizer or make a planting hole in loose soil.
1,Item Misrepresented,"Product FeaturesPrepares soil for planting and seedingPowered by an 18-volt battery (wouldnt you assume it comes with it)Adjustable telescoping shaft and soft grips for longterm comfortWeighs 8.0 pounds; 2-year warrantyPerfect for general weeding and soil aerationOk...where in this description does it say that it comes with no battery or charger????? I would of never ordered if it didnt! Even the picture shows the product with a battery attached!What a joke, customer service of no help and now wont answer my emails. I wouldnt buy from this company!"
1,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in this product. I read all the reviews and was convinced this was just the thing for my small garden. I spent an hour doing one row and much of that time I was pulling grass out of the blades. I was so impressed with the reviews that I purchased an extra battery and blades. Not sure what I'm doing different from those who wrote such glowing reviews.
3,BLACK n DECKER GC818 CULTIVATOR,"Received it last week and have kept it on a constant charge since.I have used it 4 times since and I am only getting about 30 minutes use before I can hear and see the machine slowing down due to battery losing its charge and then need to place the battery back on charge.But overall, it surely beats the heack out of wear n tear on my knees and is actually enjoyable to operate.I would recomend any serious gardener to purchase this itemBlack & Decker GC818 18-Volt Cordless Electric Garden Cultivator"
3,Meh - Underwhelming.,"I loved the 18-Volt Black & Decker drill, and I love the 18-Volt cordless electric weed-destroyer, but this one just falls short. There isn't really enough power to deal with any seriously hard/heavy soils. Yes, you do save some manual labor, but you certainly do not save any time since it does not accomplish the task very expediently. I can see a use for this in a small garden (and by small, I mean Square Foot Garden) prep, and some light weed removal, but that is about it. Overall, I wouldn't get it again if I had the choice. On the bright side, I got it at a fairly low price, so it was almost worth it for the batteries alone for my other tools."
5,Works great!,"Purchased one for myself after using my dad's! For small flower beds or gardens, this works perfectly. Easy to use."
5,Just what I needed!,"This little cultivator is perfect for tilling between flower beds, adding a row or two to a small vegetable patch, and weeding between plants. Lightweight, easy to use, it fits in tight spots, reducing the need to bend. It has enough power to dig in dry, packed soils, operates from a battery slid in place on the handle. No cord pulling, no electric wires trailing along behind. Battery recharges in a short time after each use, and lasts long enough to get the job done!"
3,It's OK.,"Easy to hold, does a fair job, as long as the ground is clear and easy to work, so what the advantage is I'm not sure.For years I had an electric hoe which was perfect for hard ground, and digging out weeds, so I expected the Black and Decker to be as tough. It isn't, But if you have cultivated ground, it's easy to use. I would recommend it."
4,Very good product.,"I purchased the Black & Decker GC818 garden cultivator to turn soil in a home garden about 12 x 18 feet in size. The soil had not been turned in several years and was somewhat compacted and full of roots. The thought of turning the soil by hand brought visions of an afternoon of hard labor and an evening of sore muscles. The Black & Decker unit made the job a snap. It churned the dirt to a depth of about 4 inches. The unit worked like a charm and let me do the entire job in about an hour -- about the length of time a full charge of its battery lasts. The motor appears to be strong and the blades are made of thick steel. For my purposes the cultivator was perfect. I think the unit might not work so well with dirt that is highly compacted, consists mostly of clay, or is full of large rocks. I am happy with the purchase and would not hesitate to do it again."
2,Great if you already have loose soil...,"I bought this because we have some garden beds with some gnarly weeds and I was wanting to start up a new vegetable garden... it works great if you already have loose soil... but if you have dense or compacted soil or even heavens forbid- clay, you're wasting your time and money. I live in Cincinnati where the earth is half clay, half dirt. I followed the directions and waited until the ground was plenty dry (a week after the last rain) and it was almost impossible to use. I'm seriously thinking of taking it back because I made more progress with a hoe in a half hour than I did with this cultivator in an hour which really disappoints me because I was eyeballing this for the longest time."
3,More fun than efficient,"The greatest appeal of this cultivator is that it makes a tedious job kind of fun. As other reviewers note, two batteries are needed. Nine hours of charging time is rediculous for any product manufactured today. This isn't the tool I hoped it would be but it does make my neighbors want to borrow it when they see it."
2,did not like it,"it did not work for my yard. there is so much of noise while operating this cultivator. i tried contacting the vendor and they in turn directly told me to contact the manufacturer. if your soil is hard or clay, pls. do not buy this unit. i saw so many review and bought this one. also the battery dies out so fast. i should have got the corded unit."
4,Does what it Claims,"A pragmatic, instrument well suited for the intended task. If you're thinking of a starting a small vegetable/flower garden, this is the tiller for you. To be used for an area of 200 square feet (+/-) one can till and cultivate the pebbles, small rocks, and dirt clumps to prepare a soil bed for personal growth. The battery power pack provides enough of a punch and time to get the job done."
3,Average product,"Not very powerful, in this case you get what you pay for. It can do a job (small) but don't expect a lot from it or you'll be disappointed."
4,Great for garden boxes,I used the cultivator in my vegetable garden boxes before spring planting. I spread out my compost and then used the cultivator to turn and mix the soil. It was much easier than using the shovel. I could walk around the boxes and the cultivator could easily reach everywhere without having to climb on top of the boxes. I also tried it in my flower beds and it had no problem turning the soil that has not been touched in years.
4,GREAT EASY TO USE PRODUCT,"I bought this tool as I was tired of seeing my wife doing her gardening with a hoe. I had reservations as the soil here in Oregon is NOT the best for this type of machine. Well I was mistaken when I showed ""Pre-Purchase"" concerns.After a thorough overnight battery charge, we both set about doing the front garden areas. WOW! What a workhorse! It took about 1 hour of time to complete the job, (about 40 minutes of running time) and the battery still had life left in it. The difference between job time and running time = rest time for us 67 year olds.FULLY RECOMMEND this unit (unless you are working in clay).PSThe extending handle is very ""back friendly"".JohnSpringfield, Oregon"
4,Good battery life and better than a rake,"I was suprised at how good the battery life was. I was able to work for about 20-30 minutes on a 25'x6' section of garden with one battery. As long the soil wasn't too hard, it did a nice job at dressing it up and breaking up small clods of soil. As another reviewer said, if the soil is impacted, this doesn't do much at all. It would be nice if the teeth on it could grab and dig a little better. It does have decent power/torque, and I think it would tear up the impacted soil if it could grab it. I debated returning it, but I am glad I didn't. It has proven useful."
5,garden culitver,"I ordered the cultiver to use in my garden. It is light weight and easy to handle. The batteries are nice. I don't have a cord to drag around.I have a big tiller, but it is heavy and hard to handle. It does a good job breaking up the dirt and weeds. I would recommend it to anyone to use.It isn't hard to handle and it doesn't hurt your muscles like the heavy ones do.Bonnie J M Peach"
3,What a Shame!,"The lyrics are beautiful and so is the music. But unfortunately, she is not a native speaker and in just listening to the demo's I noticed some mispronounciations and grammatical errors. Although, I'm sure non-native speakers won't notice. I'm still tempted to get it - since my daughter is a native spanish speaker I doubt she will repeat the errors."
1,Very Dull and Boring,This CD is terrible. The songs are boring and the melodies dull. There are much better choices available: UniVerse of Song by Maria Del Rey and El Doble de Amigos are two delightful CDs that are way better than this. No one in my family wants to listen to this insipid CD.
3,flying seeds,the flax seeds were nice but the bags were not sealed properly they were all over the card board box
4,Another satisfying excursion with the Coynes,"A very interesting plot line in this delightful addition to the saga of Dermott & Nuala is a history of cruise ships on the Great Lakes. I found myself humming o/~ the legend lives on from the Chippewa on down ... when the gales of November come early ... does anyone know where the love of God goes when the waves turn the minutes to hours?"""
2,Irish OverKill,"I have tried to read 3 novels of Greeley's Nuala Anne McGrail Series and quite frankly I did not get past 3 to 5 chapters before I could no longer take the ""Irish Overkill."" This fascination with the Irish goes way past ""normal"" fiction. One cannot reasonably cast the character within the boundaries of fiction. The Irish do not possess anything better or less than other cultures and perhaps Fr. Greeley could research the treasure of other cultures with as much enthusiam as he wishes the Irish possessed. Greeley is a fine novelist and wonderful story-teller, he does not need to fill page after page of abberated nonsense about a culture that in reality has alot of beauty but reading one of Greeley's McGrail novels will definitely turn one off of the Irish."
3,Did The Cover Artist Read This Book?,"Look, much is made of the fact that Fiona is pure white. So we have a charcoal Irish Wolfhound on the cover. Hunh? Can't be Fiona. OK, a small mistake, get over it. This story is about GRACE, and one significant part is the distinction of human parents and animal(read Fiona)parents. Get the dog right or pedants like me will miss the more important points. Father Greeley has said, 'read my memoirs to learn what has happened to me, read my novels to learn about me."" Let's get these details right or we will never learn about him. The little story that surrounds the grace part is not as compelling as some he has written. Still, the love of Nuala Anne, Dermot and now Mary Anne will keep readers coming back for more."
3,just a pouch,"Nothing to write home about....kinda thin, if you dropped on the ground, you had a 50/50 chance of damaging your GPS, as the GPS sticks out a bit..."
5,How did I cook without this?,"My hubby got me this for our anniversity and boy am I glad!! I was so tired of holding the hand mixer, having it bog down and then having to remix the dry ingredients that did not mix. I made some homemade icing and it was soooo creamy that my friends thought it was store bought!! It's easy, I don't mind the missing ""tilt back"" in other mixers, I can work in a smaller space. BTW, it's heavy so don't think you can just pick it up and move it. I hope everyone else who buys this has as much pleasure as I have had using it!!! Go KitchenAid Go!"
5,Kitchen Aid Mixer is Superior,This was a gift for my daughter. She has already used it and is thrilled with the performance of the mixer.
4,VERY different from hand-held beaters,"This product is a big transition for someone accustomed to using a hand-held beater. It's very sturdy and does not bog down with thicker batter. Mixes throughly and the splash guard is somewhat awkward, but works.However, I wish this either tilted back or had a way for you to spin as much of the batter off the beater as possible. Disconnecting the beater and removing it while the bowl is still in place leaves more batter than I like on the beater and trying to remove the bowl with the beater still attached is even worse. I spend too much time scraping batter off the beater. Maybe buyers who are not as cheap as I am won't be bothered by this, but I hate to waste anything."
5,Quite a different thing...,"These Argentinean band is mostly characterised by the programming and sounds they use, they make u feell in a completely electronic environment without being to noisy. The variety of sounds in each sonmg makes this record a great one...the web is www.popmiranda.com"
5,Great Music,This is just a beautiful c.d Rita has a perfect voice I just love her music. I have had the chance to see her live in concert here in Australia in the mid 80!s
4,Great toy!,"My son likes this toy very much. He can not only make castles with molds but also make little snowman and house by his little hands. This toy is really fun but somehow messy. However after give him some instructions, my son can handle it well."
2,"Messy, messy, messy!!!!","The title of this review says it all. This stuff is so messy- you better treat it just like regular sand and have your kids play with it outside.It will get everywhere, and if you can sweep most of it up and return it to the sandbox, it's not bad. But after doing this 50 times a day, you get tired of the stuff. And don't even try to vaccuum it- it will clog your vaccuum cleaner big time. It sticks to the floor, your socks, your clothes, anything it comes in contact with. you can brush it off, but then it's on the floor.it might be fun, but I think we're going back to play doh. At least it dries out where you can clean it up."
4,This is so much fun!,What is the problem here? It's messy? We do have kids right? They are messy little creatures. My 4 year old has not stopped playing with this. I do need to get out the vacuum and It doesn't come with enough sand. I'll happily buy more. Great winter craft. He takes his little star wars guys and playing with them with the sand. It's fun!
3,Fun but very messy...,"What child has not seen and asked for this product? It has been very heavily marketed on television. While my youngest has enjoyed it, even he has complained that it is ""too messy"". The inflatable plastic ""moat"" deflates quite quickly, leaving little barrier between the sand and (inevitably) the kitchen table and the floor. On a positive note, since the sand remains moist, it is relatively easy to remove it from a surface once it lands."
2,moon sand a waste of money,"my daughter wanted this so badly!she begged and begged. we finally agreed,not knowing exactly how it was going to be. do not waste your money! buy some nice play sand for a sand box instead. add water. buy some molds and cookie cutters. or go to the beach for free! this stuff was a mess! most of it ended up in the trash. my 6 yr. old is neat,but this was all over her! i asked her if it was worth it to her and she said it was fun,but she has not asked to use it again."
1,Moon Sand Nightmare!,"Imagine trillions of sand-sized particles of Post-it Notes glue. Now imagine giving a bucket of it to your four-year-old. My son played with it, very carefully, for ten minutes and then quoted the commercial. . .without the mess? He wanted to wash up and didn't even object when I told him it was going into the garbage. He begged for it for weeks and hated it within ten minutes!Avoid it at all costs! It sticks to everything like a gritty film."
1,MISLEADING!!,"Clean? Neat? Easy? These are the words used to promote this product. But there's nothing clean and neat about it! No way around it...it's sand...and it gets EVERYWHERE! Even if you have the inflatable sandbox. It sticks to their hands, their clothes and their hair. And if you drop it on the floor, it will not vacuum up w/the dustbuster! It is fun (as sand is always fun for kids), but it is NOT clean, NOT neat and NOT easy.They make it seem that it is magic play-doh like sand...that once it's squished a bit, it gets moldable and clay-like. Don't be fooled...it just stays...sand-like. And unlike playdoh, if you mix the colors - there's NO going back!Unless u're willing to take it OUTSIDE...I wouldn't bother."
2,"Kind of neat but very, very messy","Moon Sand works as advertised (molds kind of like wet sand, make sand objects inside the house without going to the beach). However, the fun is limited in that you don't really create anything (for example, molding clay into an animal). All you do is fill something with it and pop out the mold. Plus, most of the fun of building sand castles is wrecking them afterwards. You don't want to that with this product. It is extremely hard to clean up."
2,messy - too sticky,"Like many other reviewers, we also found the moonsand to be messy. Another issue we had was that you try to get the moonsand into the pieces in order to create your castle, but then the sand doesn't want to leave! You have to tap it really hard to force it out, or not compact the sand hard at all, in which case it just crumbles when it comes out."
2,Moon Sand not better then playdough!,"I got this Moon Sand for my kids for Christmas and I gave it to them as an early Christmas gift. Boy was that a mistake! It was more of an heasdach then playdough has ever been. The sand was EVERYWHERE! and yes you may be able to vacume it up but we lost 1/4 of the sand in the first play. Playdough you make sure there in the kitchen so when it falls it's no big deal, you pick up the big peices droped add them back to the mix, moon sand goes everywhere and aside from the fact that it doesn't come with very much sand to begin with so of course you need to buy more which works well for the manufacture because they have a continuing customer. Once this is done I will be happy to show it the garbage and save me another headach."
2,Not exactly what it says it is,"I purchased this for each of my 3 children ages 5, 8 & 10. I do not recommend it for any child over 8 years of age. The 10 year was so bored with it he poured all of the mixture in his youngest sibling's tray. They tried to build with it but ended up just squishing it. It seems fun to run your hands through and try to pack it, but it won't pack enough to build a castle like what is shown on the packaging. The mixture gets stuck inside the molds and when you try to get it out to make a castle it crumbles. The 5 year old wants to take the molds and blow up tray to the beach and play with them in the real sand. Come to think of it, real sand and water would work a lot better than this product."
2,Too Messy,What a huge mess. This stuff gets everywhere.. doesn't exactly mold well. If you have to buy it.. set it up outside.
3,Moon Sand fun but messy,"Since we love the beach and building sand castles etc...this was a fun product for my eight-year-old and I. However, the only caveat is that you do not get enough sand to build the castle they show on the box...bummer and you can't buy xtra packets of the moon sand, which i would do. We had no problem with getting the sand out of the molds, the secret is to pack it in tight and then turn over and tap the mold hard. It is stickier than regular sand, but it is messy. It wasnt too hard to clean up, but you lose a little everytime you play with it and so they really need to offer extra packets of sand for sale or provide more sand with the kits."
1,URGENT! STAY AWAY!,"This is the messiest children's product I have ever encountered. It ruins any fabric (including rugs and carpet) that it comes into contact with. If you intend to use this in your house, you would be much better off with a bag of playsand. At least real sand can be vacuumed and swept. This stuff sticks to everything and is nearly impossible to get up off of the floor. Yes... the kids do enjoy playing with this, but they are equally as happy with [..] worth of Play-doh."
1,Not like real sand,"In all fairness this is a really neat product in theory. My 8 year old, daughter bought the castle set with her own money and was very disappointed. It doesn't stay together like real sand would if making molds. It's almost like it needs to be a bit wetter. As far as clean up goes, a vacuum does a great job. I've had this stuff in my carpet, on my couch, on my hardwood floor you name it I've found it but it cleans up easy. Now every time my daughter sees a commercial for this she calls it a rip off. Says the commercial lies."
2,short lived messy fun,"After reading many reviews on this item, I caved due to my curiosity, plus I am an easy marketing target. I thought about how cool it would be for my two little ones (2 & 5) to play with during the winter since they love the sandbox - WRONG! It holds their attention for only 5-10 min., then they don't like the feel of it stuck on their hands, along with the rest of them, as it gets EVERYWHERE (as I know some reviews warned me...). I think we've had to vacuum up almost 1/4 of it in just 2 times playing with it. We bought 2 extra cartons of sand and only put 1 extra in at first. The 2nd one will NOT be going it, as this will be disappearing once the sand has dwindled to useless amounts. NOT worth the money...I'd rather go cheap and buy playdoh or splurge and get more magnatiles. THOSE are worth their weight in gold - NOT this product."
1,"Messy, expensive - just stick with playdough","My 6 yr old son saw the commercials and has been wanting this for months. Finally got it for Christmas and what a disappointment! The sand is fun to play with but there isn't enough of it and it makes a huge mess everywhere. No big deal with cheap, inexpensive playdough but with this, I was on my hands and knees trying to scrape up every last bit to save. I like that you can leave it out w/o it drying but what's the use? Just send them to the backyard sandbox. For inside, stick with playdough. It's wayyyyyy cheaper and honestly, more fun."
3,Moonsand,"I purchased this toy for my five year old son. Moonsand really helps with his textile sensitivity. While the moonsand blow-up storage helps minimize the mess, it doesn't get rid of the mess. The moonsand really sticks in the velcro and underneath the blow-up container."
1,"Simply too messy, but the kids loved it","As a parent, unless you like to be constantly using your mini-vacuum to clean up the mess this makes, you will not buy this again. This was bought for my young daughter. She loved to play with it, but kept losing sand every time to the vacuum cleaner when we had to clean up the mess. Sure we tried tossing what we could back in, but this toy was simply too frustrating to keep having to clean up after over and over again (especially five minutes after we had just cleaned it up). Playdoh isn't as messy as this. We limited our daughter to playing with it in the kitchen where our vinyl floor is. I would never allow the kids to play with this nor Playdoh on the carpet, as both are too messy. However, this one takes the cake as far as mess is concerned. Perhaps they should sell this with a mini-cordless vacuum instead of the mat - more ended up in that than in the play mat."
2,Not practical at all,"My daughter got this for her birthday and I am giving it 2 stars, because the concept of it is OK, but the product itself is too much of a hassle. There isn't enough sand and what little there is, ends up in the vaccum cleaner, because of the mess it makes. And the ""sand"" itself is useless with the molds that accompany it, since it sticks on the inside and doesn't come out."
2,Moon Sand Concerns,"I do believe Moon Sand lives up to it's claims of being an indoor sand alternative, but I also think it is my five year's first experience of being dissapointed by what he thought he was going to get as based on the TV ads. The amount of sand is deceiving, the molds are small and flimsy. My son has enjoyed playing with it a few times, but I've noticed after I've played with it to get the sand soft and moldable that my face becomes itchy. Reading the documentation about getting it into your eyes and the warning to wash your hands after playing with it gives me a few concerns. I wouldn't want a kid under five to play with it. I'm always warning my son not to touch his face."
5,Great gift idea,"We love the moon sand castle kit...definitely one of our favorite birthday toys this year! I have a 6 and 3 year old and they both love it.It really isn't that messy and my kids keep most of it inside the blow up base. It's not grainy like real sand and makes clean up easy. The blow up base is wonderful, when the kids are finished playing, we just fold it up(sand inside) and put it away until next time.It doesn't come with enough sand, but you can buy more. The sand does tend to get stuck in the molds, but so far that is my only complaint.I would definitely recommend."
5,Great Product!,"I purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter. She absolutely loves this product. I even found it hard to keep my hands out of it. It is a bit messy...but for the fun you have, well worth it. It cleans up easily and the mat helps to contain most of it. The only thing that I would say could make it better would be to have the option to just purchase the white sand which comes with it. I purchased all of the colors as well, which does come with one additional container of the white, but would have preferred to have all white sand. I would recommend this to anyone who has a kid that you have to drag away from the beach!"
1,Disappointed - what a mess!,"I only allowed my children to play with this outside, as it gets EVERYWHERE inside, it is difficult for young children to keep it within the play set. There isn't a whole lot of sand in the pack so children easily become annoyed when they can only build a few things and then they have to destroy them. It also manages to attract dirt, soil etc outside so after only playing with this a few times I had to throw the whole thing away. Complete waste of money. Get some real sand..."
1,Great Concept but falls short there.,I thought this would be the best gift for a little girl that LOVES the Beach. However this is not something that I love. It comes with very little sand and does not seem to puff up like it says it should once you open a package of it. The colors that you can purchase only mix together and become a colorful blob (yes basic common sense would know this). In addition it is very difficult to get the sand out of the molds once you mold it (impossible for a 4 year old). Probably due to the fact that you need to pack the sand in so hard to make it mold that it is very difficult to get out even after washing the molds in warm soapy water as suggested in the directions. Like I said in the tital great concept but falls short of being good. Stick with real sand.
1,Are you kidding?,"As a mother of 3 kids, I tend to rate a toy based on the following criteria: Is the hassle of it worth the enjoyment? Moon Sand is a definite NO. It's really, really messy. It does not stay in the blow up tray, and gets on your floor. Because it's coated to stick together, when it gets tracked over carpets you need to sweep it up with a brush because my central vac system couldn't do it. All this mess just to hear my kids complain that it's not as cool as on TV, and that the castles won't come out of their molds in one piece."
5,The sense of actually being there.,"Many of us have read quite a bit or talked to others about this time frame and the events in the pacific theater. I was especially interested in the island life and events as they unfolded caused by the Japanese invasion and control. I always wondered why I could not find a book on an individual's experiences from almost a daily basis on the Solomon Islands. What a delight to find. Martin Clemens has written not, a sensationalized version, instead, an experience making the reader think and feel like they were there. I burned through this book."
4,oiler pen,This tool is easy to use and allow precise application of oil in tight areas of various mechanical assemblies. Applying oil in an inverted location takes some finesse as it relies on gravity to feed out of the tube but is still none the less do-able.
2,"Oiler maybe, precision maybe not","Maybe it's a viscosity problem, but I bought this oiler for bicycle work, and when I use T9, I either get too little or no oil, or too much - usually too little.I don't think of T9 as a high-viscosity oil, so I was surprised at the lack of oiler performance. At least it doesn't leak."
1,leaky waste of money,"Don't waste your time with this oiler. I have 2 of them, and they both leak when stored on their side in my toolbox. If you store them upright you might be ok. The dispensing of oil is actually nice if you can keep oil in it."
2,Defective design: bad o-ring support.,"It is a defective design. The metal body where the o-ring resides does not provide a proper surface for the o- ring. Instead the o-ring resides on the male threads for the screw cap. The threads cut into the soft rubber o-ring and the o-ring can not sit straight.You can not see the threads under the o-ring in the sellers photo, so I am letting you know. The threads go all the way to the hilt.When you screw on the cap it does not seal properly to the o-ring and further presses and scrapes the o-ring on the sharp threads. This cuts the o-ring with use.When I received the oiler I was amazed such an obvious defect was not addressed in the design. It is rare that I am unhappy with an Amazon order."
2,Dated,"I checked this out after hearing Deep Forest's absolutely phenomenal remix of ""Liquid Cool"" on Sasha & John Digweed's Northern Exposure. Apollo 440 is a 90's techno act through and through, but create a little variety with their judicious infusion of guitars and jock rock motifs. I enjoyed the original version of ""Liquid Cool"" (though it doesn't even compare to the aforementioned remix), I really enjoyed ""Omega Point"" with it's gorgeous downtempo groove and trippy samples, but didn't care for much else on the album. High energy rock techno, super cheesy synth lines (think Nintendo 64 racing game cheesy and you'll get the idea), and bad vocoder vocals. ""Film Me & Finish Me Off"" and ""Pain Is A Close Up"" are bearable (the former actually being a decent techno tune), but this stuff is really too dated for contemporary electronic tastes to enjoy."
5,The Marvelous Land of Oz,"This is the second novel in the wonderful Oz series. It's about a young boy named Tip. Tip's guardian is a witch. Tip is threatened to be turned in to stone, so Tip tries to run away. He builds a Scarecrow that comes to life. Thus begins an awesome book. It's very funny, the chracters are great. This is a classic. just as good as the first."
2,Disappointed,"I'm slogging through this book with my 5 year old and it's got to be the most boring thing I've ever read. I realize he was writing for a different culture and time period, but that's no excuse for such bland, clunky prose. Interesting stuff happens - the Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse have marvelous potential, and General Jinjur and Baum's take on feminism should be a riot. Instead, their antics are described in such dry style that I have to re-read paragraphs to recognize the attempts at humor. I had high hopes for reading this series, but I think we're giving up and going back to Moomintroll."
5,Baum's second best Oz book,This book is Baum's second best. It has such strange creatures and it has every thing the Wonderful Wizard of Oz lacked. Baum is a genuis and this book proves it.
3,A Fabulous Followup,"The first sequel to The Wizard of Oz shows how the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman are inseperable... showing that a heart and brain need one another. The story is told of the discovery of the true ruler of the Land of Oz,and you'll be amazed when the discovery takes place."
1,Simply awful,"My cat won't even go near the stuff, probably because it smells like a mixture of soy sauce and pickle juice.. not to mention it's got the consistency of pine tar. It gets EVERYWHERE. She'll eventually lick it off her paw, but I can tell it's only because it's annoying her. To the people who said their cats love it, thanks for confirming that my cat is weird. Don't waste your money without some kind of trial, first. See if you can borrow some from a friend, or something. Don't dive in an purchase this stuff without knowing it will work."
1,Sentry HC Petromalt - Has Changed!,"We have been buying this product for years. This last time we received it, it was very soft and sticky. If you tried to put some on your finger it would run off. When our cats tried it they ran off too. This was a great product not sure why the manufacturer changed it...."
4,Petromalt change update,"Petromalt changed formulas late last year and cats around the globe (including my two, who are obsessed with it) were sad. I spoke to a pr person at Petromalt who told me they would be reintroducing the old formula this year. It can be distinguished from the new,disgusting formula by looking at the first ingredient. If it is ""mineral oil 44%"" it is the original, good formula of Petromalt. If it starts with corn syrup or anything else, it is the new bad formula. The tubes are indistinguishable and they are not going to change labeling. I have found 2 tubes of the original formula within the last month, mixed in at the pet store with about 10 tubes of the new stuff. Check the label before you buy."
1,Formula Change is for the worse,"The formula has been changed and the lead ingredient is now corn syrup. Although they adored the previous formula, my cats won't eat the new formula. I'll have to cruise the stores looking for old tubes I guess. I hope Sentry will make note of my and other complaints on their formula change."
1,Cats hate new formula,My cats loved the old formula...thought it was a treat. Now they refuse to eat this. Its runny and messy.
1,New Petromalt Formula,"The new formula is terrible. Corn syrup is now the main ingredient! My cat who used to go wild over the old stuff won't touch it!!!!!!!!!!! Is the company insane? Do they know anything about cats? Have they ever met a cat? If your cat likes something, you DO NOT change anything about it. Cats are the most finicky eaters on earth! They are also the most discerning. My cat smelled the stuff looked at me as if to say, ""you gotta be kidding, you think I'm gonna eat this crap!""I hear the company took a huge hit as other people and their cats have had the same experience and they will re-introduce the original sometime in the coming new year. They better!Dumbest company decision since New Coke!Sentry HC Petromalt Malt Flavored Cat Hairball Treatment, 4.4-Ounce"
1,Formula Change,"As many others have stated, they have recently changed the formula. I thought maybe it was runny because it was warmer, but checking ingredients against the old one shows the same problem. I can't understand how a company can be so greedy to try to save a few cents by switching ingredients and packaging, putting millions of pets at risk. It is truly unconscionable. I am going around to all the pet stores around today to see if I can find the original and buy them all up."
1,Cat hates new formula; it's a useless product,"This company ruined its product by changing the formula. It is absolutely useless to me now, and I won't buy it again. Sentry, if you're reading, I beg you: PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA!For years, my cat eagerly licked this gel off my fingers, even when pills were hidden inside. Now he won't have anything to do with it. It was truly my last option for hiding pills, since he rejects Pill Pockets, other hairball gels and even human food.Beyond the fact that the cat hates it, the new slimy consistency just makes a gooey mess of everything if you try to force into a cat's mouth. It's just awful."
2,"Works, but doesn't stick","I bought this when Petromalt was made by Virbac and it worked wonderfully! I had used Laxatone, however my cats usually threw that up. Since Seagents took this over the remedy does not slightly stick to my finger and when I try to place in the cats mouth or when he licks it, the ribbon now falls on the floor. Virbacs had some ""stick"" to it allowing me to place it in the feline's mouth, this does not and I have tried 3 lots from 3 stores. The search is on for a new remedy."
1,petromalt return of original formula,"I was quite surprised when I received a package in the mail from Sentry. I had an ""Original"" formula tube of Petromalt in it. Wow I thought this is great. I have been searching for tubes everywhere I go and horde the few I have.I read the ingredients and it differs from the original packaging of ingredients. After mineral oil, the next ingredient is petroleum. Petroleum isn't mentioned on the tubes I have. As I see it this is not the original formula. My vet said it's not recommended to use petroleum so I have thrown it away. Thanks Sentry for trying but no cigar."
2,"A disappointment, but ...","While this is a much inferior product when compared to the original Petromalt, it does still work for the intended purpose. The trick is handling the runny, sticky, gooey mess the new product has become and making it palatable to the cat. Unfortunately, I've found no suitable substitute, most competitive products being a similar mess.First, refrigerate the Petromalt. This will allow you to handle it more easily and appears to appeal more to the cat, since it attenuates the stickiness which seems to confound their efforts to eat it. Take a small plate or saucer and get a layer of cold water in it, which helps prevent the product sticking to the plate. Squeeze out some Petromalt and use a utensil, like a knife, to cut a portion off at the nozzle, into the plate. Shove a few kibble treats into the Petromalt and serve immediately, before it warms and becomes gooey.I make no excuses for the manufacturer, but I've found this technique at least makes the product usable."
1,Cat Won't Eat,"My Cat will not go near this stuff. I even put some on her favorite treats and she won't touch them. Also, even if she did like it, I wouldn't want to get this goup all over my hands everytime I feed it to her. It's messy stuff.If my Gram's cats don'l like this, I'll definitely be returning."
5,Outstanding,This is the only product of its find that my cats will use. They turn up there noses ay all the others I have tried. They eagerly eat this product without any coaxing.
1,They changed the formula,"I just bought the family size tube and it is now in a plastic tube, not metal. The ingredients are now different. My cats just sniffed and walked away when I gave it to them. Normally they love this stuff and I used to give it to them every morning and it seemed to really help with the hairballs. Now I have to try to find another product. Thanks Sentry for changing what worked :("
1,Darn it Sentry HC! Need the original back!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, I too have been searching for the origianl Petromalt as my kitty requires it daily. The original tube has a small cap, not the big plastic cap on their newer version. I too called Sentry and originally he said the ingrediants did not change, but a lot of consumers have been complaining about their pets suddenly ""turning their nose up"" to this newer type product. It's even runny and won't stay on my finger well like the original. He stated that Sentry is revising the product and should have it back on the market by the beginning of the year. Not sure if we'll know if it's the revised product if they don't note it on the packaging or alter their current packaging. Very frustrated!!!!!!"
2,Still not improved...,"Per comments from another reviewer I had hoped the manufacturer of Petromalt had returned - in early 2012 - to the recipe that had been popular for at least the last few years (which is the product I was familiar with), before the recent complaints started. I ordered 3 tubes from Amazon on Mar 12, 2012 and the product is as bad I have read in some recent reviews. The ingredients did not match what I saw online; corn syrup now being the main ingredient. The gel is not as solid as before and it comes out of the tube (which now has a larger opening) in a looser, stickier mess that it used to (when barley malt syrup was used, although I'm not sure if that's the only difference). Only one of our cats doesn't like the new recipe, but it's so much messier that I don't think I'll order it again."
1,New formula ... not as good,"My cat used to love that product but since the new formula (w/ a large plastic cap) it won't touch it. Not to mention how difficult it is to get it out, that sticky stuff is awful. I bought this product late in November and since I am looking for a similar product, no luck so far.."
2,Too thick,"My cat seems to like the flavor but it is much too thick and solid for my cat the lick easily. I will not buy this again, it might be better for dogs who will chew the ointment."
3,Not thrilled,"I have a long haired cat, constant hairballs. When I first started using this product, it seemed to work, now, not so much.They need to make it more appealing (tasty) when I mix it with his favorite wet food, he won't eat it until he is very, very, hungry. I do not care for the new plastic tube, the metal one was better and easy to get it all out. May try something else next time."
1,Changed Formula for the WORST,"I've been using Petromalt for years now and my two cats love it...or I should say USED to love it. Now, with the new tube and new formula they actually run from it. They knew before I did that something wasn't right...then I had an old tube lying around and compared the ingredients...totally different! My cats were smart enough to run! I'm going to return these two tubes I purchased and never buy Petromalt again!!! I'm on the lookout for a comparable brand out there to the old Petromalt ingredients...anyone that has any suggestions I'm all ears!"
3,Not as good as before,"The wording and box might be the same but the product is not. I used to get the same item from Petsmart but it came in a alum or whatever that material was but it was not the plastic tube this is in. My cats will only lick small amounts of this. Where as they would eat the other until i put it up. The consistency is different. This one is more stringy, messier. I even tried putting it in the fridge. They still do not like it as much."
1,Read Ingredients,"I purchased this in October 2011 and noticed it was very 'watery'. My cats used to love it and now would not eat it. I called the 800 number to complain. They asked if I would like a call back from someone at the company. I said yes and received a call in a couple of days. The company representative was very friendly and informative. She stated that her company had bought the company the owned Petromalt but they would not sell the recipe so they had to do the best they could. Over time they were finally able to get them to sell the recipe. She told me it could take some time to get this formula ready and distributed. At that time she did not know how long that would be, maybe a year. I have contacted them once again for an update. I will let you know when I hear something from them."
1,Why change an excellent product?,"I've been using Petromalt for a couple of years to hide one of my cat's medications in...nothing else worked. I just started a new tube, to find a completely different product in it. The formerly firm gel that could be easily formed around a pill is now something that becomes a runny gooey liquid in the time it takes to form it around the pill, which it then flows off of. It's like trying to wrap a pill in warm honey.It looks like the major change is the addition of corn syrup. Why should this be in a product for cats, who lack the sweet receptor, and thus can't taste sugar?"
4,bang for your buck,"bought these when amazon had 'em [on sale]--inexplicably they went back up in price... For [the amoutn I paid], i can't complain, they're great as the left and right fronts for my home theater system (using a Yamaha HTR-5550 receiver, energy s8.2 sub, 2 cheapie KLH's for rears and a wharfedale diamond center channel). the manual is very skimpy, if that matters to you. the grill is pretty cheap and flimsy, as stated by others.The sound is very rich, reproducing effective lows and highs. I'd highly recommend it..."
1,Flimsy,"In the advertisements this seemed like a video with a real detailed workout and nutrition plan because it claims to be for people of any fitness level, but it falls short in both areas. The video quality is terrible, but that aside anyone with a basic knowledge of fitness will find this a complete waste of time. Even beginners will be lost because not enough detail is included for the beginner. Also, without a gym membership this video does not work. All in all your money would be better spent somewhere else."
3,"Good Ab Exercise, but a Poorly Made Video","John Basedows commercials caught my attention, so I ordered the DVD 6 Pack Abs. Unfortunately, It took three DVDs and two months to finally get a DVD that didn't skip. Now I have the DVD that functions properly and I do think the abdominal workouts are good. One thing about this video: I believe the video was made in one take and there was little or no editing done. On almost every exercise, he messes his count up by at least ten reps, and I can hear the camera men moving around in the background. Sometimes his microphone even rubs up against his shirt and his voice is barely audible. I believe too much attention is given to us staring at his own abs, and I find myself having to fast forward through it to save five minutes."
1,notice the above ratings....,"i was looking into this video today... so when i got on amazon, and read the reviews (above) i noticed that 1 was VERY POOR, and gave and explaination as to why it was poor... all the others sounded more like a sales pitch....So... if you look at all the 5 star ratings... click the ""view all my ratings"" link next to their rating... and you will notice that all of them have ONLY COMMENTED ON THE FITNESS MADE SIMPLE VIDEOS...This would tell you that these are fake comments, put in by advertisers....---my personal thoughts..."
4,Nice tapes!,"These tapes worked nicely in my old JVC camcorder. They did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back, though. For some reason other tapes didn't do this. But it was a very faint sound, and I am happy."
2,Disappointed - but still good for the collector,"I have the album Cicero put out, as well as the CD singles that were attendant to it -- these were great. However, his post-Pet Shops Boys phase does not seem to have the same character of sound or integrity. Plus, I don't know who the woman is who does most if not all of the singing on this single. She isn't given major billing -- who is she? She's a good singer, but not quite what I ordered. So, buy it -- it's cheap! How can you go wrong. And fairly good. Just not what I thought of when I thought of Cicero."
5,It's Perfect,"After much searching for a TV riser that would fit my 32"" HDTV and accommodate my DVR box underneath, I finally found this one. It is perfect. It is the only riser I could find that was wide enough for the TV and tall enough to allow enough space above the DVR box so it doesn't get overheated. I would recommend it to anyone. I use it on my dresser so it is easier to watch TV in bed."
2,TV stand,"Sturdy product, good seller, very prompt, but the item itself is just not attractive enough to match our decor. Might have been better in the darker color, which was not available. Very strong, good product, but too industrial for our living room. Sellers very easy to deal with. They accepted the return without problem."
3,tv table,screws holding the table together had come undone and were rolling around in the box. box was damaged so maybe that was the cause. table works okay so I kept it.
4,Wool I Lie to You?,"Having determined that I have the requisite opposable thumbs for knitting, I stole a peak at my wife's copy of Knitting Pretty, and was immediately drawn in by the contemporary tone and aesthetic of the book. Two weeks later (with a little positive encouragement from my sweater half), I am on my way to knitting my very own, dyed-in-the-wool, scarf.Knitting Pretty has been an enjoyable introduction to a craft I am finding surprisingly mathematical and definitely relaxing. I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun new hobby."
5,Great book for kintting beginners and veterans alike.,"I learned to knit with this book. I started out with the small projects and knit several of them, then gradually worked my way up to more complicated patterns. The patterns are all very understandable for beginning knitters. The projects have all turned out great for me. I highly recommend this book. I still love all of the patterns, even with several years of knitting experience. I have also bought this book as gifts for my knitting friends. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Quite a few projects I would and could actually do!,"Unlike so many knitting books, I found at least 6 projects here that I could do and WOULD do! I loved the idea of the snake scarf, the headband and the tube top. They were simple but something that someone would actually like to receive as a present. The patterns were quite clear.A few things I didn't like---there were not pictures of every project. I really find it hard sometimes to think what a knit project will look like without a picture. Also, for a book that mainly features projects for beginners, there were WAY too many patterns that used double pointed needles. I have been teaching myself knitting for the past few years, and the one area I find impossible to master is using DPN. This might be just me, but I've heard others say the same thing. I don't think it's the kind of technique to use that much in book for early stage knitters!"
2,"Looks attractive, but does it knit up?","Even as an advanced kitter, I found this book very appealing to pick up and explore the projects. After trying two pieces, the poncho and the folk shawl, neither one turned out as was suggested in the patterns.The poncho required much fiddling with the wool/gauge to get the look in the picture, which attracted me in the first place.The folk shawl, which I relutantly finished, complete with fringe in the suggested yarn types (wool, cotton, mohair etc), was so disappointing, I am taking it apart and knitting a wrap of my own design. Though the yarns are beautiful together, the length-wise weight narrows the drape across the back too much for me. It's too skinny for shawl, considerably too skinny for a throw (a 54"" version would be stunning), and too fat for a scarf.After spending a respectable amount of time with this book, I believe there MANY better 'beginner' knitting books than this."
2,Where's the GAUGE???,"Ever other knitting book/magazine/pattern etc. has stressed the importance of knitting gauge. Unfortunately, the patterns in this book don't even offer a gauge! I knit the baby booties...they came out absolutely adorable but were better suited for a Barbie than a baby...they were sooo tiny! I changed to needles two sizes larger and still ended up with bitty baby booties.Without a knitting gauge, it is really hard to tell if you should change yarn, needles, or if you are knitting too tight or loose.I also agree with the other readers who commented on the lack of photos. Why would I spend hours and hours on a project with no idea of what it should even look like (imagine spending two months on a sweater that you absolutely hate!).There are sooo many other knitting books out there for beginners...skip this one and get Stitch n Bitch or Debbie Bliss ""How to Knit""."
1,things too simple to knit,"Not too interesting book on knitting, alot of mundane things to make - not too challenging. Pretty photography though, but if you are looking for a twist on simple knitting-this book doesn't quite make it."
3,Beginners book,"Truly for the unintiated beginner. Has very simple patterns like purse, scarf, simple pullover. It may be a bit boring for those who had already done the simple projects. Find that the other book Hip to Knit is also good for beginners but with more interesting projects and tips."
1,Sorely Lacking,"The book *looks* pretty, but how can you have a pattern for a sweater and not mention the gauge or the finished dimensions of the piece? What are we supposed to do? Knit it up and then hope that it fits? It's an attractive book, and it does make you want to pick up your needles, but the lack of photographs for every project and the lack of diagrams make it very frustrating."
4,Anti-intimidating for Beginner's,"I like this book because it's a clear marker on the journey of becoming more comfortable with knitting. I can tell I'll grow out of it pretty quickly. But even then I'll use it to compare other more sophisticated patterns to the ones here, to understand the differences and learn that way.It's so easy to get lured into a pattern, thinking it's manageable, all of a sudden something happens and I'm over my head. With this book, there's nothing over my head!And the patterns are all so cuddly and fun, very engaging.A very good intial step."
3,"Great ideas, but not for the beginning knitter","The patterns in this book are very nice and inspiring. However, having used three of the patterns so far, I have found errors in all three patterns. Additionally, there is no gauge information for any of the patterns. A beginning knitter would have a hard time knowing if they were on track due to the information that is missing in this book."
4,it taught me...,"how to knit in 10 minutes. I used to know how to knit when I was a little girl, then I forgot. My husband taught me to crochet in grad school, and I picked that up quite quickly. I tried teaching myself how to knit again - through using many books (I'm a librarian), and failed.This book worked for me.Some of the reviews by experienced knitters here sound rather elitist.As for the lack of the gauge - is this really important for knitting a scarf? She does mention gauge, just not for every pattern.And the paperweight cover? it's good practice. The beer cozy is a humorous touch to what some consider an old woman's hobby. Take it from one who deals with sterotypes on a daily basis - I know it isn't and you know it isn't, so appreciate the creative nature of this book.If you consider knitting a science and follow recipes with no alteration, skip this book. If you consider knitting an art and are not afraid to be creative once in a while, check this book out."
3,Pretty not bad,"I'm re-learning to knit for the third time and am quite addicted at the moment. This book is excellent for its descriptions of the stitches and how to execute them. It has some really fun patterns (I love the worm scarf!), but it doesn't have images for all of the projects, and sometimes it pairs two projects in the same photo but doesn't say which is which (easy enough to deal with when you know how to knit, but maybe not when you're just learning). I think the best part of the book is that it has some great suggestions in the back on where you can find more patterns and ideas."
3,Nice pair of boots.,"They are a nice pair of boots, i just don't like them. I got a size 10m and they felt like 10 narrow. I'll be donating them to the Salvation Army."
5,great purchase,"This pair of boots are really comfortable, they are not too tight, and they are very flexible. I really recommend them."
3,Tonya,The shoes look cute. However by using the name Naturalizer; I was assuming that these would be comfortable to wear. The toe section is narrow and the insole of the shoe is hard. Try to wear them on a 8 hour shift at work which is on my feet all day and I had to change shoes. I would only recommend wearing these a few hours at a time.
3,Not quite as comfy as others thought...,"I ordered a half size smaller since one reviewer said they ran big, but they don't run big enough for me. I should have stuck with my original size. The toe area is a little on the narrow side and the shoe bed could have a little more padding for comfort. Ok for an occasion that only requires wearing them for a few hours, but not a comfy enough shoe for all day walking and standing. Otherwise a very attractive boot and I love that the top is very fitted around my ankle."
3,leather boots,"The boots are very sporty. I ordered a half size larger for socks. Good thing I did, other than that they may have been to small. They fit a little more snugly than I would have liked them to. They will have to be broken in."
2,bed rail not described,"this bed rail cannot be attached to a regular bed. it was not made clear when purchased that it is some type of rail that has to be nailed in or screwed in. nothing was included with it to show you how to do it plus there was not anything to let you attach it.! very misleading, i returned it"
2,"Sturdy, but easy to break during installation","This rail is a long piece of wood that screws directly into the crib legs. The problem is that a thin piece of wood is designed to go around the legs on each side, to hold it more securely into place. The piece of wood is overly thin, though, and breaks off if you are not extremely careful during assembly and shipping."
3,Beautiful but big,This pendant ended up being a bit bigger than I thought it would be and I likely won't be wearing it. It is a beautiful piece and the quality and stying is excellent. My mistake for not realizing the size.
5,best animation artistically,"When I think of stream of conciousness and animation together as one, I think of Bill Plympton.Most particularly, I think of ""I Married A Strange Person""It is totally hysterical and there's always something that will surprise you when you think you've seen it all.Bill Plympton should get more recognition for his work, even if it is cruder than a children's animation."
3,Not Bad,I purchased this book as my first introduction to the Russian Language. I spend a lot of time rewinding the tape in order to try and understand what is being said. About 75% of the phrases on the cassette are written in the book in Russian along with the English translation. I wish 100% of the sentences on the cassette were written in the book. The book is good because you get a combination of grammar and conversational skills.I did some further research and for developing conversational skills possibly the Pimsleur approach is the best. I have ordered the Pimsleur introduction course which is audio only.
1,Didn't expect to get a gender-specific slipcover,"The ""bonus slipcover"" pictured is a green, gender-neutral pattern, but the slipcover that was shipped is a blue sports theme. Nowhere was it said that the pattern may vary, and had I known, I would have bought a plain boppy and chosen my own slipcover, instead of paying an extra $5 for a ""bonus"" I don't even want."
4,Card in good shape.,"I received the card very fast. It was in good condition (as the description described), not excellent. I would buy from this seller again. Thanks."
5,Best shredder Bar none,"I have had this shredder three years. Before getting this shredder I went through 4 shredders in a matter of a year. None of them lasted long enough to get my moneys worth. In the last three years, I started a job that required shredding sensitive information on a regular basis. It has withstood any hours of shredding paper, CD's. It has been amazing! Don't hestiate making this purchase! It is worth everything penny."
4,"It works as expected, but 'auto' already quit!","Just like every other stinkin shredder I've purchased, the 'Auto' option quit working. It gets hot if left on, so you have to do the manual ON and OFF.It shreds well."
4,The Dansing Star,"Kirby Jonas spun one hell of a yarn. I gave this review four starsbecause I am very ""picky"", and don't give the highest ratingeasily. But I have since bought three more of his books and have notbeen disappointed. I am amazed at his multiple talents as writer, photographer, artist and songwriter/singer. How many authors design their own book covers? Try Kirby Jonas, you'll like him."
3,"l""amour redux","this work clearly copies the formula and style of louis l'amour. i read it only because of the reviews that claimed it was better than l'amour.i cannot agree. it is generally entertaining but lacks the broad scope and diversity of characters common in l'amour works. it also lacks the feeling from l'amour works that he probably experienced events similar to those portrayed. if you disagree, ask yourself honestly if you really believe that jonas was not affected by l'amour. certain parts are repetitious and the action gets recycled. some parts are very cliche and sophomoric. there are subtle differences on moral codes. l'amour heros don't kill unarmed or unsuspecting opponents. jonas' attempt to introducevulnerabilities of the hero for assumed purposes of realism don't seem to work - they just make him look weak or compromising."
5,The best of Clannad,"Like other reviewers here, I first knew about this group through their 'I will find you' sound track. I went out and bought the CD, and glad I did. I then bought few more of Clannad's, but nothing matched this one. This is a unique album that was made with passion. As a whole, it is very romantic. There is something enigmatic about a song with lyrics I don't understand, yet the music tells it all. Those tracks with English words are simply beautiful, almost poetic. My favorite track is (8) Caide Sin Do'n Te Sin. I've worn out my CD copy like the other reviewer, and am in need to buy a new one."
2,A pointless cover mix,"Back in the late '90s, I was a big fan of No Doubt. I especially loved their ballad ""Don't Speak"" (before the song became a single and got played one gazillion too many times on the radio). I loved the song so much I even bought a dance remix by a cover group called Clueless. At the time I was a big fan of eurodance music too. I thought turning a ballad into a dance remix was completely pointless and extremely cheesy (like Savage Garden's ""Truly Madly Deeply"" and Leeann Rimes' ""How Do I Live""). I gotta hand it to Clueless though, Gina Pincosy who sings vocals on this song sounds exactly like Gwen Stefani. The remixes are nothing to write home about. They sounded like your paint by numbers eurodance song. Not very original, nor very good. I still don't like the original ""Don't Speak"" but I like this cover version even less so."
1,"Don't Seak,Cluless soundtrack single","fast shipping,but it wasn't what I expected. It is not sung by No Doubt. It is a cover"
4,Love them,These are cute little shakers. I would have giving them 5 stars but they where scratched when i got them.
4,Effective mask,"I use working outdoors for things like mulching leaves and doing other yard work. Use the mask because of allergies. Think this is the best disposable mask I have found. Only downside is the rubber straps are a little flimsy, but ergo ""disposable."" I would recommend these over others in this price range."
5,works very well,"These are much better than the cheap-o masks. I could breath just as well as wearing no mask at all. The fit is ok, not exactly right around my nose, but that's to be expected for a one size fits all product."
2,Straps paper thin will break very easily,"Mask seems to be good at stoppinmg dust etc but the straps when they break and they will rendewr respirater useless.I bought a box of ten and am through half of them in a week and all five that broke strap snapped.Ok if your really really delicate with it than it wont break but pull even a bit much and it snaps.A rubber band you can pull far harder than these strapsAnother useless,flawed product."
2,There are better dust mask out there,"The Moldex - 2300 N95 is an inferior product. Because there is no metal nose clip dust enters the mask, and your lungs, at the bridge of your nose. I had the annoying experience of at least 20% failure of the straps when pulling the mask over my head for the first time and further strap failures when trying to remove them for the first time. The straps are fastened with small loosely crimped staples.A much better product is the3M 8511 Particulate Sanding Respirator N95, Valve 10-Pack. Click on the link and read my review."
2,Not Individually Wrapped,These items do not come individually wrapped. If left in a contact room they would have to be thrown in the garbage. I recommend buying 3M.
3,Not bad but I expect more for $600,"I purchased and set up an HP 3100Cxi. Prints fine, scans OK, faxes well but NEVER try to use another device on the same parallel port (as even pointed out by HP) I expected better integration and sharing (with other HP printers). Oh, by the way Tech support took several weeks to get back to me and they did not answer my question well. I now use USB for my other two HP printers and Parallel with the 3100"
1,Terrible Tech Support,"On the positive side, the print quality is very good.There are a number of negatives, however: (1) The fax shares a phone line with my answering machine and is supposed to distinguish between a fax and a phone call. This works only about 75% of the time (i.e., I doesn't receive about 25% of the faxes which are sent). (2) The software hook-up to the computer is not seemless. I have it conected to a very good computer (Dell pentium, 128 mb ram) and I still get an error message that the printer is not hooked-up when I turn on the computer; I need to repeatedly hit retry to get the printer hooked-up everytime I turn on the computer. (3) Everytime it prints a page, multiple pieces of paper run through the machine (i.e., it does not feed 1 sheet at a time.) (4) There is no toll free number for customer support. I have spent a lot of money calling customer support and they have not been able to solve any of the aforementioned problems.In summary, I do not recommend this machine."
1,Watch out for paper jams--you may need a technician!,"I've had a tough time with my unit, which was delivered just days ago. Set-up was simple enough, but the first time I tried to send a fax, the paper jammed BEHIND and wrapped around a roller. I tried everything to pull it out, called HP tech support, etc. I ended up with lots of small pieces of torn paper, sore fingers, and no progress. The machine is designed in such a way that a simple paper jam can require a technician to take things apart! HP, I expected better!"
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this cord to be able to pay my iPod through my stereo at home. Almost immediately after purchasing, there was a short in the cord and you have to play with it to get it to pick up all portions of the sound. Purchase another brand if you can."
1,not worth your money,"I purchased this back in August to play my iPod through my car stereo. It worked great for the first week, then only intermittently would it work after that. Now when I do get it to work the sound is awful and I just threw it away and I'm searching for another brand to purchase."
5,"Quality Product, Sleek Looking, Great Price","I had an auxiliary audio cable that died on me. I was looking for a replacement that would allow me to hook into my car's stereo system from my SanDisk Sansa Fuse. This product works perfectly, is really sleek looking, and was pretty cheap...the quality of the connectors would indicate otherwise though. I was asked a few times how much I paid for this cable because it looks high end. Love the product, had a great experience with the seller. Would order another one of these if needed, and would do business with the same seller if given the chance :)"
1,"""breaks easily""","very hard to fit and stay in the flash and after only two times using it broken. Maybe it was a little small for my flash. Look for other option. It does not worth the money. Bought from Crossover enterprise, it was sent as promised and arrived on time."
5,Fulfilling a need,As an in home charger did not accompany the Magellan Maestro I purchased on line. It was prohibitive in price on their home site. I found that in todays market it was a great value through your site.
2,Great book; cheap edition,"The binding here just isn't strong enough; I wasn't the only one in my class to buy it, and several of us had chunks that would separate from the binding/fall out. I did appreciate the font size (relatively large) for a text this difficult, though."
2,Big Disappointment,"As previous critics have written, the printer does not feed paper correctly, which leads to *most* print jobs having to be redone. It is so frustrating to see the ""Paper Jam"" and ""Printer Out of Paper"" (when it's not) error messages pop up every time I want to print something.And as another critic mentioned, the printer uses a lot of ink. Since printjobs must be done over so often, so much ink gets wasted on half-printed pages that are torn up by this machine.The scanner and photocopier are a nice addition. I use those often. However, I am not sure I can use the fax machine... the directions aren't very clear, and it appears that you can SEND faxes with the device, but not receive them. It might have to do with your Internet connection, whether you have dialup or broadband. Tricky.Overall, I do not recommend this printer. I have come very close to throwing it out my window from frustration!"
3,Reference book or not - still boring,"The level of information in this book is outstanding. However it is delivered in a very monotonus way. I know the material presented and I utililized other reading and documentation to support the ACE book. With my education and background and supplemental information I would have still passed the exam. However if the ACE reference book was my first and only encounter with the subject matter the exam would have been a nightmare. The book is a good reference guide. As I have completed my graduate coursework in the kinesiology area, this book has been of great value."
3,"chemistry, anatomy, nutrition and more",I have never read a book that was so boring. It was like reading a college text book. It's a book you have to know if you want to pass the ace certifications and I don't envy the people taking the test. It is a big book with definitions you wished were more broken down.
1,good cutter until the screws fell out,"I was very happy with this cigar cutter at first -- smooth action,nice grip, it just felt solid and stable.Then after about 3 weeks of ordinary use, cutting a handful ofcigars per week, 2 of the tiny screws in the handle fell out.It's a real pity because it's a nice cutter if it holds together.To make matters worse, Amazon seller ""eLighters"" doesn't carryreplacement screws; they offered to send a replacement cutterat a reduced shipping/handling cost ($5), but I don't believein paying to replace a defective product. I may also try tocontact the manufacturer (Visol?) directly.Hopefully this cutter is a 1-time problem; I also have a VCUT-14and it provides the same smooth action and clean cut -- as longas the screws hold together."
5,Want a solid role model for leadership?,"Wow! What an amazing book. I picked it up to read with my co-chair partner for Impact Camp to strengthen our leadership skills, and little did I know that this book would completely revamp them. I gained so much from this book, not only in applicable leadership skills, but it drew me closer to Christ and my walk with Him. If youre wanting to get a good perspective of an ideal role model leader, pick up this book and see what Christ sets as our example."
1,Doesn't fit!,This filter does not fit a 2006 Mini Cooper base model as suggested by the guide. Wrong one! Annoying to have a car fit guide that is incorrect.
4,Simple fun,"The Thomas & Friends ""stories"" are a staple at our house to ""wind-down"" near bedtime. We have seen all of them lots of times."
3,End Of Season 8,finally this videowill be the end of season 8 hip hip horray!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the episodes are...Thomas Gets it RightEmily's New RoutePercy's Big MistakeAs Good As GordonJames Gets A New CoatThomas Emily and the Snowpluoghsongs:Engine Roll CallEmilyits the end hip hip horray im my word this dvd is ok but it good cause its the end of season 8 the worst season ever!!!!!!!!!hip hip horray end of season 8
2,I prefer the Genki series,"I took Japanese 1 using the Genki series, which I found to be much more comprehensive and easy to study from, with quick references to the lesson content in each chapter introduction, and the kanji learned in the corresponding sections in the back pages.I'm now in Japanese 2, and we're using Yookoso. Yookoso isn't nearly as nicely laid out, and does not work well for studying from. The workbook is actually necessary in order to get a good study session out of the series."
2,What an awful text...,"This is crap I don't know how this would help the beginner student and the grammar and vocabulary it covers are ridiculously simple and simplified, once a certain level of Japanese knowledge has been reached this book becomes useless. The ""Integrated Approach to Japanese"" by the Japan Times that is a much better text for beginning-intermediate to beginner-advanced level students. THAT text is arranged in a useful way to refer to even after the student increases familiarity with the language."
1,not shipping as told when ordered..,I wanted this in 3-5 business days upgraded to the Amazon premier and now I cant get it for 18 days!! that doesnt work for a college class that is going on NOW
4,I AM IN LOVE !!!!!,Wow this book is superb. It is fantasic. i thought it would be pants and retell all the basicss and deny any rumors but no. It gave me up to date facts and was very personal. from the mickeymouse club to boyband to solo !!!! my favourate part is the pictures they are the best and in perfect colour !!!!!!if u are a justin fan u should definatly buy this book !!!!!!!
4,What I thought?,The book ws interesting to me as i like Justin a lot and wanted to know more about him and his past. However the writer does not include all the info that I would have liked to write about. The book kept me interested as it had pictures and the text was simple and very easy to read. Although it was not written by Justin I still feel that what he would have said is something like what the author puts across.
3,Great Tomato,This book has been very informative and I have already employed many of the tips and ideas from this book to my own personal Tomato patch this year. So far my plants have grown tremendously and am now waiting for them to ripen.
5,How to Grow World Record Tomatoes,"This is a Superb book, great resource. This man has an amazing technique for growing vegetables. I checked it out at the library and then I wanted to buy it so I can have it as a resource for my own garden."
2,For ppl who have big calves this is not for you,"The boots look good. The designs might fall off since its glued on the boots. For ppl who have big calves, the width is not big enough even with the adjustment. It won't pull up at all."
4,Very Cute Boot,"These boots are just as they appear in the photograph: fun, cute, and protective...I mucked through the mud at my farm and no wet feet.The only issue I had with them was that my feet pressed against the top of the boot...to the point of loosing feeling! I took the insoles out and PROBLEM SOLVED! Maybe less comfortable but a thinner insole could be bought and inserted.Bottom Line: Definitely worth the adjustment for these cute boots"
3,Cute but defective,"I love these boots, very adorable, however they left dark rings around my calves even when I wore jeans inside the boots! Also, anytime I wore them in the snow my feet got wet even though snow never came over the top of the shoes!"
5,great remix of the original version!,"The original version of ""Come On Over"" on her debut album was pretty fun and catchy, but this new radio remix beats it any day. ""Come On Over Baby"" is groovy and laced with new sounds and rhythms, making it a song that makes you get up and dance your heart away. Christina Aguilera's powerful voice and vocal finesse is evident throughout the whole track and really displays her talent. ""Ven Conmigo"" will have you start to sing along in Spanish (if you can) and the ""I Turn To You"" remix works for the song as other remixes do not and gives the song an edgier feel when you prefer faster and upbeat to slow and sentimental. This cd is definitely worth purchasing."
4,A great addition for comic book collectors!,"I don't read comic books. I hadn't read a comic book until now. However, I promised the author that I'd give it a whirl. This is a very entertaining paranormal comic. The graphics are top notch (although I have no previous reference), the story is fun and kept me, a novice comic reader, interested from beginning to end. This would make a great addition to a comic book enthusiast's collection, which is why I'm sending it to my fifteen-year-old nephew. I'm sure he'll give Morbid Drive the word of mouth it deserves."
1,Same problem,"I also purchased this knife block and received a COMPLETELY different item than the one displayed here. It is a flat, rectangular shape with no staggering and only one knife size. It is OAK colored, as opposed to brown. It does not have a stand. I talked to customer service and then sent me what was suppose to be the ""right"" item for free... Instead, it is ANOTHER of the same wrong item!! The seller needs to change to picture or remove the listing."
3,"Not great...problems with fit, got what I paid for.","I purchased this for my 18 month old. He is 35 in tall and weighs 33 lbs. I bought it in size 3t-4t. The majority of this costume is one piece and the cape attaches with velcro.I had to make sure that he wore a white tshirt under the part that is supposed to be white because there was no closure for the front and his belly would have been showing. The back collar does not stand. It is a very strange, crushed velvet kind of material that shimmers a bit. I wasn't expecting much for the price but I was still disappointed."
2,Velco does not stay in place,I purchased this for my 2 year old son for Halloween 2011. The cape was constantly detaching from the velcro. The white part underneath the costume would not stay in place. This product is definitely not durable enough if you have an active son.
2,"Not very hot, not very flavorful.","This ""hot"" sauce is not particularly hot and not especially flavorful. I find myself using more than a tablespoon of this sauce to flavor a 112 ounce bottle of unflavored salsa. With a truly hot sauce it requires 4 - 6 drops to get the same degree of heat in the same amount of salsa. I live in the South and can find better hot sauce at half the price in my local high end supermarket.J.R. Wilt"
5,Fun and Exciting,I can't complain about this series. I enjoyed everyone of them several times. My mom even reads them. It is a great concept to have them work together. It would be fun to see a new tv series based on these books.
5,Targets,"Financed by Roger Corman, who lent real-life aging horror star Karloff to newcomer Bogdanovich for two days, ""Targets"" is a compelling thriller loosely based on Charles Whitman's 1966 murder spree at the University of Texas. Karloff, essentially playing himself, is marvelous in one of his last screen appearances, and Bogdanovich expertly juxtaposes cinematic and real-life horror, resolving the tension in an unforgettable finale that unfolds before a giant screen image. Shelved by Paramount, who felt the movie would not play well in the wake of the King and Kennedy assassinations, ""Targets"" was a brilliant debut for the future helmer of ""The Last Picture Show."""
3,"A FINAL APPEARANCE, A NEW BEGINNING, and MASS MURDER","'Targets' is wonderful movie which introduces a new Directing talent, Peter Bagdonovich, and also is the setting for the final appearance of Horror movie giant Boris Karloff. The movie is good although the weak plot. The cinematography is cheap but thats what makes it good. The film is about a young ""All American Boy"" who becomes a mass murderer by Sniping people at a drive in Theatre which is home to a premire of Boris Karloff's final movie. THe image of the sniper is compied after Charles Whitman, the individual who killed 14 people from the University of Texas Tower in Austin. The sets are cheap but the directing skill of Bagdonovich makes everything work well. See Targets for an interesting look at Karloff's final performance plus a wonderful Independant Film."
4,Do it. Cannot go wrong for the price.,"My apologies for my lack of confidence in rating any record, not just this one, which happens to be the first to compel me, and thus, I feel the need to urge all who might catch a glimpse of these reviews to try out this record, if only for the divine ""Champion Sound"", which my partner has mixed into sets unexpectedly, with great success. Sexy groove, it works if you can work it. I love it."

5,Wonderful 20th century Brasilian music,"As a non-pianist (but as an amateur classical guitarist) I will not comment on the technical performance of these waltzes, but musically the interpretation is wonderful. Francisco Mignone was an extremely interesting composer of many, many works and wrote several series of ""Brasilian"" waltzes (for piano, for solo guitar, for bassoon) that incorporate certain 20th century modernistic compositional techniques but are eminently listenable as beautiful and interesting music.I cannot get these tunes out of my head!"
5,Mick Alone,What an album! It's great to hear Mick Jagger doing his own thing. I bought this CD to replace an old tape and I enjoy it today as much as I did years ago. Primitive Cool and Party Doll being my favourites.
3,Not the greatest output!,"I also bought this album (CD) when it first came out in the late 1980s, starving for something from the Stones. I actually liked She`s the Boss and hoped that this one would be equal to it, but perhaps a little more up-to-date. Boy, was I wrong. I think that, apart from one or two tracks, most of it`s garbage. Listen to ""War Baby"" and I keep expecting to hear bombs go off and the sounds of sirens.I guess the thing is with Mick is that he was in a class of his own and did not have to produce this kind of stuff. I am sure he really does not like it, and he certainly did not need the cash. Pass on this one and buy Waundering Spirit instead."
2,Not his best by far.,"I love the Stones and have always been willing to check out the solo releases, but in the years since this arrived I have yet to be able to listen to it all in one sitting. The single ""Let's Work"" is a cheesey working class singalong, and ""War Baby"" has one of his most ridiculous lyrics, ""I was born in a war, so they call me a war baby."" Aside from ""Throwaway and ""Shoot off Your Mouth,"" this record lacks what every good Stones record or great rock and roll record has -- a good groove. Two many of these songs feel stiff, without the ability to swing. Get started with Wandering Spirit, where Mick successfully mixed rockers, blues stomps, ballads, and his own take on country to much better effect. Not to mention, this has to be one of the ten worst album covers of all time in ANY genre."
3,It would be better if Mick wasn't trying to sound like Bon Jovi,Although it's certainly better than many other 60s/70s artists attempts to do the same in the closing years of the 80s. That wasn't a good trend.
3,"Not very primitive, not very cool","Primitive Cool is Jagger's second solo album. If She's the Boss (1985)was a decent, though not great record, Primitive Cool turned out to be a major disappointment.The album as a whole was not very good and did not show any sign of improvement over She's the Boss.As to the songs. Let's Work - the first single released from this album - is really crap. And the other songs are not much better. Most songs are boring and the lyrics are often pathetic. On say you will Mick sings: ""cast all you fears aside, say you will, say will be mine"". The words in Throwaway are not much better (used to be a casanova, used to dance bossanova,..). This is ridiculous. Mick Jagger should remember he can do better than that!The only songs to be saved is Party Doll, which, when played acoustic, is a nice little thing."

2,fails,"Loved the game in my youth, had a scratch and will not go a certain mile on level 1cant progress with the game"
3,Poor Range-Few Features-Mediocre Sound Quality,"This item was highly rated by a consumer magazine that doesn't sell advertising, so I bought it, even with the lackluster reviews I found on this site. It stores only 10 numbers in memory, does not show the current time, does not have a ring volume control (only on/off), has poor range so I have to leave my living room to use it, unlike my last phone, and the mic is not very sensitive so you have to be very careful of how you hold it so that you are always speaking directly into the mic. 3 stars may be generous but it hasn't dropped calls or anything catastrophic like that."
5,A Rare Find!,This is one of the few phones that allow a headset. I work from home and it's so good I ordered a new set!
5,Makes life easier...,"We have VOIP for our phone, which is through the internet, so we don't have phone lines. Up until we got these, we had just one phone hooked to our computer in the living room and when the phone would ring, we'd have to run to get it before it went to voice mail. Now, we have 2 phones, one in the living room and one in the bedroom right next to the bed. Works great."
1,Low price Low reception,These telephone have low price and low reception too. I cann't use it more than 10m distance between telephone and base... it is rubbish... it is the same that a cord telephone with 10m wire...Next time I will buy wire instead of GE cordless telephone....
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I bought this phone because Consumer Reports rated it ""excellent"" for voice quality. Not! There was a lot of echo and a tinny quality, which changing channels only helped somewhat. I didn't have a problem with distance from the base, but I may have returned it too quickly to discover that."
1,This phone is horrible...very disappointed for a GE product,"This phone has terrible audio qualities, both in terms of being able to hear who you are talking to, and also their ability to hear you. The sounds in the phone are very muffled, and the strength of the signal fades in and out. Automatic call-back feature is difficult to program, as with many of the other features. Spent way too much on this phone...and I think Consumer Reports actually gives it a good rating. Don't be fooled, this phone is terrible."
3,GE Cordless Phone with 2 Handsets,"After talking for several minutes on second phone, must move closer to the base unit because my voice fades."
3,object oriented programming,"One of biggest complaints I have about asp.net is they do not start with the basics of object oriented programming. This book reviews classes, variables, arrays and ado.net sql programming. THIS BOOK STARTS WITH THIS, however please you Should have some background in object oriented programming before starting this book.!! This book provides a nice reference. Muti-architectural asp.net has many facets classes, controls,sql-ado.net etc. I have yet to see a perfect(ASP.Net book(I did search in columbia md and white flint mall) so this book is just one piece of a large piece of the asp.net puzzle. The other books should be in sql-ado.net, hashes, parse, controls, data grids etc"
1,a complete waste of money,"The guide provides a very brief, uninformative overview of the different game modes, an incomplete list of individual character moves, and a compendium of the capsules available that only vaguely points to how they can be obtained.Many questions that people will have about the game go completely ignored, such as:- how to specifically unlock various characters, locations, and the dragon arena mode- how the character stats function and how points added to a stat affect performance- how to perform certain moves and techniques like fusion- where to find the dragon balls, money, capsules, and events in Dragon Universe modeThis book should not be considered a ""game guide"", but rather a limited overview. Save your money and do a search for tips and guides on the internet instead."
2,"Yngwie yes, Ron no !","Ron Keel is nowhere near the great metal singers of the eighties.In my opinion he's just a squealer with little feeling for melody. Yngwie's just the opposite: this guy eats and breathes melody. So if you can live with the fact that a band is good and the singer isn't, give it a try. Young Yngwie gave it a try too ..."
5,Great album,"The CD is awesome and it became one of my son's favorite albums. The only problem I encounter was that at the time received the box came broken. we didn't know till we open it, couldn't sent it back.thank you,Sherry Guzman"
1,Oh Please!,"Touted as the best-selling independant CD of all-time. Nostalgia-wise, this CD is a must for all Yngwie fans. It is interesting to hear him play in a band where he is not the centerpoint. But only in it's nostalgia and oddity is this CD enjoyable. Ron Keel does most of the songwriting and the CD suffers for it. It also suffers from the fact that he sings. ""Serenade"" has to be simply the most awfully sung ballad I have ever heard. I find it hard to believe that all the reviewers giving this 5-stars would ever be caught dead blasting this CD in their car stereo where there is any threat of anyone else hearing it. Ron Keel's voice is awful and Yngwie sounds so out of place that it makes one cringe. I only own it so that it fills the nice empty slot I had before Yngwie's Rising Force CD on my shelf. It hasn't left that slot in a long, long time. I might just have to dust it off tonight and enjoy the nostalgia."
3,typical 80s rock....,"... and this is from a man who misses the 80s; the energy, the feeling, the message of get out and have a good time (not this cry-baby 'i hate my father' - 'life sucks' crap like Puddle of Mudd). Unfortunately, Yngwie's first US album was with this band, fronted by and named after Ron Keel. Good songs, but seem too simple for Yngwie's solos... kind of like a high performance engine placed in a Ford Escort Pony. Highlights are ""Cold Day In Hell"" and ""Seranade"", albeit Keel seems to be a poor-sounding Steve perry Wannabe.... this song reminds me of the Yngwie/Joe Lynn Turner ballad ""Dreaming""... of course without a great voice like JLT.If you want to know how good (or bad) this band was, just remember: Ron Keel later became ""Ronnie Lee Keel"" and was a country singer for a while....what a poseur"
1,Refund please.....,To suggest that this is an awesome album begs the question: Have you heard any other albums before? This is 80s LA metal at its most embarrassing. Do your self a favor and pass on this one.
4,INXS GET FUNKY AND IT WORKS!,"This is a brave and daring album from one of Australia's premier rock bands.It is as good if not better than their successful ""Kick"" album. This is a vibrant foray that covers all spectrums of music.It is funky, moody and rock n roll. The album showcases the musical maturity of the band along with the power,passion and versatility of Michael Hutchence. There are many standout tracks including the duet with Ray Charles on'Please',the down and dirty 'Full Moon'and the funky 'Make your Peace'to name a few. It is an album that should be in any INXS collection."
4,Underrated.,"For some reason, this album often gets overlooked in the INXS back catalog. This is quite a strong album, full of good guitar grooves. 'Days of rust' is a killer opening track. 'The Gift' is full on with a great video. 'Time' has some great guitar. The four songs from 'Please' to 'Kill the Pain' are as good a sequence as you will find on any INXS album.The album does suffer from inconsistency, a flaw that marked all of INXS's post Kick albums. By comparison to their previous albums, to me this album most resembles 'Shabooh Shabah,' perhaps due to the fact Mark Opitz is again producing (I think). An album worth a listen."
3,"Rushed, Half-Baked, Not Their Best","""Full Moon"" is full of great ideas, killer melodies, passionate lyrics, with a high energy level, but no great songs. INXS rushed back into the studio after ""Welcome..."" and it shows. They seem to really be brimming over with enthusiasm but they didn't take enough time to truly flesh out the songs. I can't give INXS any less than 3 stars because I love them even when they are not at their best. It's a shame but understandable that they lost popularity with this album. I miss them terribly."
5,"funky driven INXS ""the real one""","inxs who have shot to fame again with their talent show contest too find a new singer to replace the in-replaceable Michael hutchence..1993 one year after ""welcome to wherever you are"" a classic album up their with their early albums and their last under-rated ALBUM ""elagantly wasted""this album showcases the tender side to inxsi.e ""kill the pain"" a beautiful tear jerking anthem""time"" and the classic rockin' single ""the gift""inxs were always a band eager to try different music genre and this album shows them at their most experimentalmichael hutchance really shines on these songs and excuates the hooks perfectly.. classic INXS in their early nineties prime"
3,THEIR LAST TRUE INXS ALBUM,I bought this album when i was 16 back in 1993.I was really into INX back then.I had grown up listening to Kick and The Swing the bands two greatest albums.Had heard Welcome To Wherever You Are the year before and loved it and as soon as this came out i rushed out and bought it after having heard The Gift.I wasn't really blown away by the whole thing but definitely kept playing it a lot.There's a lot of dance elements on this one.Even more than on Welcome.All in all this is their last great album...
3,"For fanatics, but still decent.","Hmmm, looking a bit grungy on that cover guys. Full Moon, Dirty Hearts is what I would call the beginning of the end for INXS. The previous album ""Welcome To Wherever You Are"" is one of their best, but this and the one after it are just alright. Now this isn't bad, I actually like it, but I'd say it's for bigger fans only. The only hit from this is ""The Gift"", otherwise nothing sounds like single material. Two songs I really like are ""Freedom Deep"", and the title track, both are quality slow songs. But two disappointments are ""Messenger"", which is NOT Michael's Iggy Pop cover, and ""Please (you got that)"" with Ray Charles, I find it annoying. Overall a decent disc, I just don't really get much of a ""Kick"" out of it."
5,Necessary and Well Done,"Everyone who owns a gun should watch this video, which covers scene safety, triage, assessing the gravity of the wound (bleeding, breathing, movement) including entrance and exit wounds, controlling arterial bleeding, assessing and treating for shock, and stabilizing a person with a sucking chest wound among other things. Production values of this video are simple and low, but Klatt is clear and knowledgeable. Three examples are given, live models with fairly convincing mock up injuries (hand, leg, sucking chest wound).Then after you have watched the video, go buy a good blow out kit and keep in the house or car. Also, be sure to know the address where you are shooting so that you can provide it to emergency responders."
3,Works,"It does its' job, and is about the standard when it comes to oil filters for the '06+ Volkswagen GTI.NOTE: A few years ago, FRAM was still using German-made filters as each filter was stamped with 'Made in Germany', I'm sure there are still a few of these in stock but recent productions are all Chinese made, and the (lack of) quality shows."
5,A great read and food for thought,"I saw this book reviewed in the NYTBR. I thought it would be very interesting as a sort of ""how the other half lives"". Finnegan makes these characters truly memorable. I've always wanted to read about how inner-city youth *really* live, and here it is. Their lives of constant struggle and their fascinating but sad separation from the world at large really was touching, and not just because I'm their age. I really enjoyed this book. I had wondered if Finnegan would be able to pull it off having four different main characters--I thought that it would be disjointed. But each episode makes you want more. Fortunately each following episode completely draws you in. I wholeheartedly recommend you buy this book."
4,Great product but alright picture quality in dim lights,"This is an awesome camera. Bought it for my wife on her birthday more than 2 years back and we still have it working great. The smile shutter is the best thing beacuse usually we dont get volunteers to click for us.Picture quality can be a little grainy in dim lights otherwise in sunlight and good enough lights, they are good enough for us. This is a very reliable camera. We have taken it along on many hikes and the pictures never disappoints. Face detection is pretty flawless. I never used much of the other features, but for an average user, this is the best product.Zooming is a little moody, sometimes it decides to use the digital zoom, sometimes it decides to not even try. The optical zoom works every time, though.The accessories that came along with it, works great even now."
4,Granddaughter Loves it!,My 2 year old granddaughter loved the Aquadoodle. It's fun to play with and it is educational as well.
4,Darwin Owes Germans A Debt,"This is a dense,fascinating look at the influence of German romantic philosophers and poets on Darwin's theory of evolution. Kant can't be absorbed easily, and his followers/critics, e.g Fichte, don't make it any easier, but stay with it. The book is worth it."
4,Nice sheets,"These sheets are very nice and soft. Fabulous deal, although I'm not sure they would sell for the original price listed. I purchased the khaki color as the sage was unavailable. The khaki is NOT a khaki color (such as a tan like khaki pants). It is a golden yellow or brown mustard color. The picture they have now reflects the color better and I don't think it is the same one they had when I bought it. Other than the color issue, these sheets are definitely worth the money."
5,Always Enjoyable Plaidy,A very readable tale. I enjoyed the book immensely. Plaidy takes an unsympathetic woman much hated in her life-time who left behind few good works and was responsible for a great deal of horror and grief -- a woman nicknamed the Bitch of Anjou by Warwick the Kingmake-- and makes her sympathetic without distorting the history. An amazing feat. Plaidy knows how to tell a story.
5,A wakeup call,"Review: Farrell has written the definitive statement on the growing mens movement. He uses a combination of well substantiated research and clear reasoning to get his point across: that ""Patriarchy"" as feminists define it is a myth based on ""junk"" science and media control. The book deals with the realties of mens lives, showing that, where females have been considered possessions, men have been considered less than possessions, strictly disposable.This book is essential reading, especially for women."
3,"Some things right on, some absurd.","He makes some good points in this book, however he was WRONG when he said married women tend to vote Republican. Back in the 1930s-60, single mothers and divorced women were RARE. More women were married than single in those days, and from FDR to Kennedy, Democrats had the majority. Even Ike would be considered left wing by todays standards.Now we have more single women, far more single and divorced mothers, and America tends to go more and more right wing. So he's dead wrong on this one."
1,The Myth of Farrell Credibility,"This is simply another reaction to the gains of the feminist movement. While the right to critique any theory must be protected, Farrell deliberately misinforms those who read his book. The only purpose of such an endeavor is to perpetuate the gender division that forced women into the positions that feminism provides one way of explaining. Farrell is merely telling his readers what he wants them to hear -men are the victims and are powerless - but refuses to acknowledge the evidence against him like disproportionate representation of women in governments around the world. Farrell needs to learn that critique does not involve slanderous misinformation. There are critiques of feminism that are legitimate, informed, and less hostile to women than Farrel's. Try Enlightenment theorists as a start."
1,Definitely not my first reading choice.,It's just not my cup of tea. It's not something that I would read because it doesn't draw my attention well I'm into fiction and romance and paranormal.
5,couldn't stop reading once I started,"I first read this book when I was 13 yrs old for an advanced english class to complete a debate assignment on men's rights.This book was immensely helpful and also very absorbing. It gave me a lot to think about and was written in an ""easy-to-understand"" way. I realized that men's rights are just as important as women's rights. This book contained many facts and convincing information and introduced me to a new way of thinking. I recommend this book for everyone of all ages... even if you don't have the slightest interest in men's rights, this book will have you reading nonstop. :o) Right now, I am 17 yrs old (a girl) and I will gladly read it again."
5,Very interesting perspective on gender issues.,"I heard about this book a while ago, and I was looking for an excuse to buy it. Finally I was assigned an essay regarding gender and decided I could pull some quotes from here to help make a point. The thesis was that both feminism and masculism have a skewed view of gender issues and that neither one of these movements could make any significant progress when this is happening (IE: feminism tends to focus on the female half of gender inequality, and masculism tends to focus on the male half).While I don't particularly agree with the points made by Dr. Farrell and masculism any more than I do with feminism, this book was an excellent tool in pointing out the counterpart to feminism and how abolishing both these movements and taking a more collective approach will be more effective in reducing gender inequality."
1,"lies propganda, and projection of fears by the king who can't handle his rreign claims victim - seat set up for another","' men are better than women"" this sexism got humor points and got 4 stars on this sight Truth is..female is the norm to avoid. "" play like a girl, sissy extra"", the norm in movies to rap music. don't tell a woman to hit back and then cry faul play. Fact:: agenda to break down family and stir competition between genders started by crowledy who wanted women gone, so homosexuality could reign, the bohemian homesexual grove continues today, and satanis levy started the stereotype of the eye candy sex object, your slave exploiting you. Church of satan admits to producing media to cleanse society of christianity. N.w.orobot agenda,starts with dehumanizing women, sexualizing machines and get you used to adrogny. Adrogyny also serves to convery straight males. This book is reheteric. falsely blame women for the pressures males put on themselves, and fails to lookk at human relations."
5,Tom Henry's Grounding Workbook.,"Not a fancy book. Just plain good old practice questions. Like the kind of questions on an entry level placement test, a Journeyman's license exam, or whatever you want to prepare for. It's a fast and practical way to get a handle on what is going on in the field of electrical grounding. Tom Henry's books are very useful like that. Not fancy, just practical. Scotty/Sioux City"
5,Keyswhitedove taken to greater heights,"If you love adventure and the wilderness, then this book is for you! This is one of the best adventure books that I have ever read. Bonnie Traplin has a way of absorbing you right into the story and making you feel as if you were there. This book also gave me reflections of my own experiences that I had in the wilderness. You will feel every emotion known while reading her story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a true adventure."
2,The only Outlook 2003 book you need -- if you don't care to find out the answers to any of your questions,"I've been using this book for about two months now, and there is a constant theme: I have a question, and this book can't answer it. Sometimes I'm able to figure it out. More often, it turns out that Outlook 2003 simply doesn't support that feature. But even in the latter case, it would be useful for the book to SAY that you can't do it.I'm not talking about esoteric stuff, either. It's all config stuff like ""how can I setup Outlook to check both my local contact list **and** the global list on the server?"" (You can't.)So, this is a good book to tell you how it works, but for 1088 pages, it does a surprisingly poor job of answering day-to-day configuration questions."
3,"Long on instruction, short on troubleshooting","Yes, it has over 1000 pages of how-to instructions, and the instructions are probably good, but not a page is any good if the program fails to function properly. The book could use much, much more troubleshooting advice."
5,Nice!!!,I am delighted with my new leather wallet. It is very well made. I wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it is because it was such a cheap price. Who would have ever thought you could get such a nice wallet for $7.99? I may order more for gifts.
5,Perfect case,"First of i work at a 4 Diamond hotel and i needed a reliable case to carry my knifes that i use while i work in the kitchen. I found this case to be perfect its very durable from look and feel and its stitching and over all feel is superb, i would recommend anybody who is working in the kitchen as a job or as a culinary student should use this case."
3,Knife Case,"My wife works in the Diatery dept at a local Hospital and after having a cheap roll-up knife bag she need a better way of storing her knifes. We saw this case at a kitchen specialty shop and thought it would be a good upgrade. I started looking on line for it. I found it on line at Amazon and it was $10.00 cheaper. Well, it didn't turn out to be so. The picture showed to have a sholder strap with it and the produce we looked at the Kitchen shop had a strap but Amazon did not. I call Amazon, they gave be a return shiping label and when the second case came back, it did not have the sholder strap. I guess that is the price you pay for buying sight un seen."
4,Great Listening with songs you will know by heart!,"I really love this music! I heard ""Gulf War Song"" on the radio and just had to get the tape. Although not all accapella as I had thought, it is still GREAT! I recommend BJ Don't Cry, Gulf war song, the drinking song, river valley and more(?).. a song about a blue collar worker in a car plant!!! BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,"Great album, a little of everything!","My girlfriend, now wife, introduced me to MF over three years ago. At the time, I was ready for something different and more substantial than what was playing on the radio. These guys are great! They have accomplished near virtuosity on their instruments, they have solid vocal harmonies, and if that isn't enough, their albums are filled with interesting and humorous lyrics. You can't find another album that is as humorous, political, and legimate in the same breath. These guys are a little liberal at times in their political views, but I still find their lyrics interesting and appreciate their viewpoints. Bargainville is my favorite MF album by far. ""King of Spain"" is an absolute riot. I also enjoy ""...Authors"", ""BJ don't Cry"" and ""The Lazy Boy"". Now if I only lived in the NE I could see them live. I have not been disappointed by any of their albums. All of them are great!"
1,Somebody shoot me!,This album makes me want to vomit. A co-worker put it on at work and now I am mentally scarred for life. I would only recommend this CD to only my worst of enemies. I appreciate almost all kinds of music but I honestly can't stand any of this wussie garbage. If you want a nice frisbee for your dog: BUY THIS ALBUM!
5,Moxy WHAT....WHO?,"That was me 2 days ago. Then by some chance I cam aross a review on a Web Site. I bought the album yesterday and I could not belive it took me 23 years to find out about this group. This music is amazing! These guys voices are perfect. Although its a little too political for my taste (wait, that did sound a little too much like Pat Buchanan) the music element is superb. Do these guys sound this good live? Just in one day I memorized the first 4 songs. I dont care who you are BUY THIS ALBUM. I can't wait to get my hands on the other ones."
2,buy wandering spirit if you like rock n' roll,"she's the boss was the worst of the mick solo albums. had 1 good song (just another night). mick became a slave to that stupid 80's dance beat, forgot how to write provocative lyrics, and also forgot that a good song needs a rhythm guitar. bad writing, bad production, bad album. this one's unforgivable."
1,Pretty forgetable,this was a very 80's 3rd tier solo album by Mick Jagger.aside from Just another night this is a very forgettable album.the vibe just doesn't feel right.
2,"Okay, maybe worth three stars","Mick Jagger's first solo outing is now a very dated 80's relic. Not without its charms but difficult to take seriously.I sort of like Just Another Night and Lucky in Love but the production is so Miami Vice / Pastel / Cheery / Reaganesque that it is virtually unlistenable now. I can just see Keith and Ronnie giggling over this one. And Jeff Beck playing guitar? Why? I wonder if he was snickering as he picked up his paycheck.This record has its moments and in no way is it as bad as the follow up, Primitive Cool. That stinker killed any momentum and goodwill Mick had built for a solo career."
3,"Hey, It's Really Not That Bad!","""She's the Boss"" has been much maligned by fans and press alike. Especially since he has released some real gems after this like ""Wandering Spirit"" and ""Godess in the Doorway."" But ""She's the Boss"" (and for that matter, ""Primitive Cool"") show Mick tentatively stepping out and showcasing some of the dance experiments he has always been interested in (hey, since ""Hot Stuff"" Mick has tried these dance beats out with the Stones). But there are some real moments of inspired songwriting too, like ""Hard Woman,"" ""Secrets"" and ""1/2 a Loaf."" And vocally, there are some very nice moments all over the record. Sure, I could have done without a few of the ""filler"" songs, and I wouldn't begin your Mick Jagger collection here, but it's certainly not a waste of your money if you like some of his better releases."
2,So So,"This album is okay, but it shows why Mick needs Keith: to keep Mick from getting lost in slick-land. The guitars are all shiny, slick, fast-picking and soulless. Give me a sloppy Keith Richards rhythm any day. ""Just Another Night"" is a good song, a good composition, and played and sung well. It's the best on the album. ""Hard Woman"" is good, with good acoustic work by Pete Townshend. But Mick's vocal is so quavering, it mars an otherwise good song. ""She's the Boss"" is okay, but it's basically ONE CHORD. Was Mick trying to do a rap song, without it actually being rap?...who knows... The other songs are so so at best. No attitude, no grit, no personality. Keith's solo albums are TOO gritty and sloppy, so Keith needs Mick as much as Mick needs Keith. Thank God they kissed and made up, and made the great Stones albums they've made since."
3,Good work!,"It's not Primitive Cool and not even Wandering Spirit, but this CD has some great tracks like 1/2 a Loaf, Hard Woman or Lucky in Love. The three stars indicate that Mick had done better works afterwards. This album is strong, there R no fillers, it's a good selection. Any fan of then 80's should get this CD, U just simply cannot go wrong with it!"
3,Yawn,"I remember being very disapointed when I bought this in 1985. I recently picked it up on CD for a couple of songs I really liked (Secrets, Just Another Nite)but I still feel the same. Too slick musically for my taste, and lyrically it's relatively weak compared to pre and post Jagger standards."
2,"The LanRoverPro sucked, Customer service rocked!","Bought this for a huge backbone install at a new Motel. Right out of the box the thing didn't work. Tried new name brand batteries, etc. Nothing helped. Got ahold of Amazon and the seller, was given a 90 day window to return and got a full refund.In the end, buy something you know. Paladin, etc. However, I would purchase again from the seller."
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited when I first started to read this book. The first few chapters are great -- there is a lot of detail about what situations cause what weeds. However, most of the rest of the book deals with the evils of 2-4, D, chemical company conspiracies, and other rhetoric. I feel that the title is a bit misleading . . . very little reference to actually getting rid of the weeds. There is a nice compedium of weeds in the back--which might be useful if you don't already have one (I do.)Overall, I think this book focuses too much on the author's ideals and too little actual what we can do to improve our situation. Not to mention it contradicts other ACRES publications (ex. Hands On Agronomy is a proponet of deep tillage but WCWP is against.) I am still looking for a practical organic weed control manual if anyone has any suggestions."
4,American Weeds,A very good book extremely informative to bad it focusses on North America only. The author could have included an index of other continents for the species for the less educated of us.
5,Great ruler,This ruler has cut my cutting by hours. I can now cut a quote quickly. I love it. This should be a basic tool in everyones chest
2,OK but needs....,"More instruction. Instruction included was not sufficient for this new user. It would help if the manufacturer would ""assume"" no one knew how to use it and was willing to spend the extra few pennies to print simple instructions."
4,Good for fast cutting,"This is great for fast cutting of strips, etc. The guides can move when cutting, so I have to make sure that I am straight above the project or use the cutting line on the very end which does not move. The lines in the middle are only 1/2"" of plastic and they do move while cutting. For my most precise cuts, I use a template."
1,"bought as gifts, haven't been used yet","These were bought as gifts and haven't been given/used yet, so I CANNOT give an honest rating at this time. If I'm able to at a latter date, I will."
2,Poorly manufactured and will stop working on you - I Promise.,"Freeze ups in the middle of songs, constant resets with a paper clip, and finally the nasty ""upgrader"" message.. i.e means your up the creek without a paddle. Sending mine back for a replacement and hoping the problems are fixed.Not Happy."
5,AMAZING....THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD...BUY!,"This is the bes thing i have ever had...right when i got it. it worked...just like that. If you have Windows media player...you dont even need the softwear...Right when I got it I hooked it up to my computer, and where it say sync device..in my library. It put my entire libray on My Rio 2.5 GB CE2100...(the only reasion I say that is because the other review is for the 6GB. And just like that...its all done. I got it yesterday evening and I charged it allnight and the battery last...i dont know what the other person is saying, but this is the best thing Ive ever had...its 10 times better than an Ipod mini...even though its half the size...honastly...i love it. It came in 2 days..GET THIS, ITS AWSOME! its the best thing ive ever had...and i dont think you'd ever regret it. It really is the best-doug"
3,It's ok,"I have this rio player and i would say that its not my first choice, but its ok. I like the fact that it came with a program to use with the computer and to me its very easy to use. However, when i got it, in 3 days of proper use, it started to freeze up and start over right in the middle of playing songs. Another problem is, i dont think that the sound quality was all that great and the earphones it came with broke apart in 3 weeks. Well, on the brighter side, it has alot of nice features like big clear screen to veiw song details, a stopwatch, and costomized playlists. So overal, i would say that its an ok player."
1,RIO CE2100 2.5 GB sucks,"My friend and I purchased this mp3 player, I don't know if was coincidence or what but the volume button of both mp3 players broke, at the time, I my opninon about this product and about the Rio company has changed alot. I've tried to get in touch with the Service Support and they didn't give the rigth attention. I asked them to send my mail the component which broke (volume button), but they said it wasn't possible... I asked that because here in Brazil we don't have service support for Rio stuff.... Can you believe ??Another problem is related the Rio web site, It's poor and badly documented.I know I understand why Rio are losing customer and It 's beingmassacred by the concurrence.That's all...."
1,What a dud!!,"Got the player, tried to transfer a book on tape. Player had book listed but when trying to play, told me no file. After 5 emails with rio, was told firmware was scrambled but gave me no options that worked to unscramble it. Also had trouble with battery keeping a charge. What a dud - not impressed with it or the company."
1,Bad player and horrible customer service,"The player broke as soon as I began downloading songs. When I contacted Rio customer service, I initiated weeks of frustration--being put on hold, not having phone calls returned--that continues months later. First, the Rio people claimed they never got my faxed proof of purchase, then they told me that the player was refurbished (it wasn't) and hence not covered under warranty, etc...Spend the extra money and save yourself headaches and large phone bills."
4,Great camera for the price.,"I have been playing with this camera for about a month now, and it is great. The only problem I have noted is you can hear noise on the built in mic, but turning on the wind noise dampener or using an external mic eliminates it completely. The battery life leaves much to be desired at only about 45 minutes on a full charge, which is not enough to even use up a full tape. And the digital zoom becomes too shaky and pixelated (even on a tripod) to use past about 150x... Other than those minor things, it is a great camera for the price, and I would definitely recommend it to any starting out video enthusiasts."
5,A must for gm fuel filters,Purchased to replace the fuel filter in my daughters chevy lumina! Extra length is nice for extra leverage if filter had been on a long time and the fasteners are rusted. The open end is used to remove filter. Wrench is polished and well made.
2,Interesting but hard to follow,I found the story interesting but the book itself jumps around too much in time. One chapter is after her death and then it relates interviews with witnesses before her death etc. Just found it hard to follow.
2,written matter of factly and somewhat boring,"I didnt really enjoy this book that much. It was kind of straight forward writing that definately did not grab me.Maybe because the story just wasnt that unusual or fascinating, i dont know. Also the wife was kind of a slut so i had less sympathy for her than i had did for other victims in other crime books i have read. If you like this kind of book, then read ""She wanted it all"". Now that was a great book, maybe because the mother was so dispicable."
3,eh...,"Some of the CDs sounds more trance/rave than techno the further the discs progress. Hard to believe none of the pioneers (atkins, saunderson, mills...were included in this ""history of techno"" compilation)."
3,"Nice product, not a great value",The paper was fine. I used it with a basic origami book. My group of 7 kids went through it all in about an hour. It probably would have been a better value if I bought it at the local craft store.
3,Book Worm Mother,"Was disappointed with this book. There wasn't much story, just Good night this and good night that. If you are looking for a QUICK read to put you child to bed this will fit the bill. But if your child likes more of a story before bed, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I have some of the other books from this author and have enjoyed them, but this book fell short of my expectations. In the book you follow a small child saying Good Night to various toys and things the child did during the day, and then ending with Good Night God. But there is no story, just Good Night. Hope this review has helped you."
5,My son's favorite,My 21 month son absolutely LOVES this book. It is the only book that he brings to us every day to read to him. We read it every night and he cries if we don't read it twice. I highly recommend this book. It is a sweet read! A great baby shower gift idea.
4,Good Focus,I liked this book primarily because it helps to teach children about God. It also helps them to learn to be thankful for creation and for simple things. It's a good book to end the day with.
1,False Advertising,"The description of this product indicates ""Made in England"" and it is a Spode Collector Plate. Spode ceramics are usually beautifully finished. However, the plate was labeled ""Made in Malaysia"" and the glaze was uneven and splotched on the rim. I was quite disappointed and returned it."
4,Compact Keyboard,Love the small keyboard. Alot less fatique to my right arm because I don't have to reach over a numeric pad to get to my mouse.
1,letter transposition problem makes it unusable for normal typing,"like at least one other reviewer, i have a big issue with the keyboard transposing letters as i type. it is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, because i cannot type at my normal speed without continuously backing up to make corrections. in the few minutes or so it has taken me to type this review, i have had to stop and make about 12 corrections.i contacted adesso support, and their response was that ""it happens on all keyboards"". it doesn't. between work and home i have about 20 keyboards from a number of manufacturers, and guess what? none of those keyboards, or any other keyboard i have used since 1980 has had this problem. adesso offered to take it back and send a replacement, but that won't fix the problem. it is a design problem. so i give up. my money is down the drain and i will get another keyboard. it's too bad, because if it weren't for this problem, it would be a great little keyboard."
4,"Solid research, rich information","I grew up in Guizhou, and has always been very facinated by its history. The Miao people is certainly the center piece of its turbulent past. I have heard many stories about the rebellion described in this book, mostly from my grantparents who lived among the Miao people. This book certainly captured the main story line of that period. Eventhough the amount of data gathered by the author could have been more, the arguments and conclusions presented are well reasoned and mostly correct. The book also contains a great deal of hard-to-find information about Guizhou, such as its geography, climate, society, economy, etc. Surprisingly, most of these information are fairly accurate when judged against the present conditions of Guizhou province. The book would have been rated five stars if it had been updated with more recent findings of the subject. I guess that could be the reason for another book on the same topic."
1,One of my dumbest purchases,"I saw these and did a quick impulse buy, didn't really pay attention to the design. I thought the ring was to hold the end piece of food from falling off during grilling (which is a problem I often have), but it is to aid in pushing the food off the skewer. Traditional skewers don't have a big handle wasting precious real estate on the grill, these handles are very long, and quite useless when heated to grilling temperatures. You can't grab them to turn the kabob, you have to let them cool off, and by then you might as well have removed the kabob contents for serving. I think these would be fine for the little hibatchi or a tiny open grill where the handles can hang off the side away from heat. Oh well, live and learn."
4,"good skewers, turn with tongs!","I like these skewers, I own 3 sets, my weber tongs fit perfectly into the top handle opening which makes turning these skewers easy. They are stainless so they clean easily in the dishwasher."
1,Not worth it,"A lot of other books in the market like Lynch's and even the dummies book had more valuable advice than this one. When I was going through the material, I had a nagging sense that the only reason the section about the finding and choosing of a financial advisor or person to handle your money was written was so that the author would have the reader want to choose him. I would look somewhere else both for an advisor and also for an author who really has the reader in mind for learning about the area of mutual funds and where to put your money. Sorry, but this book really is not worth it."
1,Marketing ploy---book not helpful,"I found as an interested investor that the case studies and examples were tedious and not too real. I also found it interesting that Bold as I understand it is a fired ex-broker, so no wonder he has an attitude. I just thought the book read like an advertisement."
1,Not a good book,"There is nothing really newsworthy about this book. The examples to me were contrived, the book just a way to make the guy sound important, and the information on mutual funds rather useless. I'd pass on this one."
5,Mutual Fund Investor,"I loved the book. It was easy to understand, had real life & timely examples/case studies and had an excellent illustration on how to do mutual fund research on my own using Morningstar.No little wonder the competition hates this book. Adam's ""take no prisoners"" attitude toward brokers has to have them on the defensive. I for one got tired of my broker calling me with the ""IPO of the month"" and promoting variable annuities at every opportunity, so I went to online investing.This book will help me become a much better investor! I highly recommend it if you are serious about investing in mutual funds or if you are tired of your broker losing your money."
1,Information not complete,"Bold truth is a description of how you go about selecting mutual funds for your investments. I thought it was good that the author had a set of commandments persay that an investor should go by in choosing investments, but when I read the book's details (I was recommended by someone connected and knew the author)I really did not find the advice useful or really that informative at all. And as for that review below about Bold's questionable background, so what if he has a checkered past about investing people's money-no one is perfect."
1,Great ideas for case studies but...,"I thought it was a superb idea for the case studies in the Bold truth, as then someone who is new to the area of investing can relate to the cases. But the problem is that the way the book is written and the way it came across to me is that I am being lectured by a teacher at my school who is just interested in promoting their credentials."
1,Bold Truth about funds review,The section about the commandments to mutual funds really did not add anything to my knowledge of the mutual fund industry. I also thought the way the author described his case studies was not good either.
5,Gret Stuff-A little dab will do ya!,"I have used the supermarket/pharmacy brands. This Crew them hands down. Cheaper than the bargan brands, because you only use a small drop."
4,"Short, but sweet",This book will have the arduous task of guiding me throught the dark corridors of Management Information Systems. Having read it I find it informative and illustrative in plain English. A good friend to anyone involved in a course in Management Information systems.
4,Silicone egg poachers,"I rather like the silicone egg poachers. It allows my to put lots in a large pot and float them. You can use any pot or pan you have to accommodate how many you need. We had 8 for brunch, (16 eggs) so it was quicker than the usual pan with 4. I did use spray pam so they just fell out easily. Perfect."
4,"Short, but listenable","Krgovich shows his inner child on this album. Lack of P:ano's usual polish and orchestration is made up for by a very whimsical feel. He really does have a beautiful voice, and the lyrics on a lot of the songs make me smile. I do reccomend the disk, but I realize that it is not for everyone.This is not a full length disk. Keep the shorter 26 minute runtime in mind when buying."
4,WITTY & MELODIC ROCK,"Although they emerged in the punk era, the Boomtown Rats cannot simply be lumped together with the angry sounds of the Sex Pistols or early Clash. Some of the themes on this underrated album mirror the rebellion of punk, like Rat Trap or Don't Believe What You Read, but the clever lyrics and catchy tunes have more in common with the work of Elvis Costello or early Nick Lowe. Songs like Me And Howard Hughes, I Never Loved Eva Braun and Like Clockwork have melodic hooks and almost Stones-like vocals. Other tuneful and energetic rockers include Blind Date, Mary Of The 4th Form (a gorgeous teen romance) and the catchy She's So Modern, my favorite on the album. Joey's On The Street Again is an impressive rock epic with an almost Springsteenesque feel in its blasting sax, tempo changes and an impressive dramatic structure. On the strength of this album, it is inexplicable that the Boomtown Rats didn't go on to greater things. The talent and the enthusiasm certainly were there."
2,keyboard tray,"The keyboard tray works well, but it arrived damaged. The packaging wasn't very well done, and the product got slammed around a lot in shipping. Hey, it works but it would have been nice if corners weren't broken off."
2,osteo biflex is hard to swallow,The first pill I took I got choked on it. I've been cutting them in half but still having problems with swallowing them and it has a bad after taste. Only been taking them for 5 days and haven't seen a change in my pain yet. Please make these easier to swallow. They are too big.
1,OSTEO B- FLEX,IT GAVE ME THE RUNS...KEPT RUNNING TO THE BATHROOM...EVEN CAUSED SEEPAGE...IT GOT RID ON THE PAIN BUT DID NOT HELP MY INTESTINES. I HAD TO STOPP USING THIS PRODUCT.
2,not sure about osteo biflex,After only a few weeks I've noticed that it tears my colon tract. anyone else see something going on with bladder/colon/kidney/etc.?
5,Great Service,"Product arrived in a timely fashion and was what was advertised. Actually, I received more pills than ordered because the one bottle of 180 ct was replaced by 4 bottles of 50 ct. It was made clear to me that I would receive what I got. Great Job!"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This is really not a negative review but the product did not work for me as expected but perhaps my expectations may have been too high. I have a hip joint that is bad, a knee that is worn out and a knee replacement on the other knee. I expected to feel SOME relief within a week and it did not happen. I am going to continue taking the product but now I am not sure whether I wasted my money or at a later date the pain relief I expected may manifest. I think that taking the risk is worth it but I would not give it the raving reviews others have done. I am 62 years old and perhaps the others are alot younger."
5,Works very well,"I've been using triple-strength for several years. I initially started when I injured a knee. I had already noticed that my knees ""creaked"" as I went up/down stairs. I also found running or walking longer distances tended to get painful. I started taking the product and soon found my knees feeling much better. I now run several miles a day, my knees are much quieter going when using stairs (I guess some creakiness comes with getting older), and overall, I find I have many fewer instances of joint pain. I used to take Ibuprofin regularly to help with the joint pain. Now, I may take it on rare occasion for muscle pain but never for joint pain.For those old enough, to paraphrase Karl Malden, ""Don't leave home without [taking] it""."
5,my knee joints feel great.,"My joints, especially my knees have not bothered me since I have used it for over a year. Ease of movent has come back too."
5,Good service,The product is right and additional they gave me 30 caplets free for every bottle. The delivery was fast.
5,Earthway High Wheel Garden Cultivator with 24-Inch Steel Wheel and Wood Handle #6500W,"The shipping box was torn, but all the parts where in the box. It was easy to build once I related the parts to the picture. The cultivator functions as described. It quickly removes small weeds, turns the soft earth and I get the exercise my doctor recommends. I am satisfied with this product."
5,Push and Go - No Start-up Delay,"If you are ready to push, this cultivator is ready to cultivate. Just takes a bit of time to put it all together, but it works as good as the engine."
1,not dvd audio,I purchased this dvd to check out my new dvd audio setup and it turns out that this is just a DTS dvd with a video track of title listing. I was very dissapointed and misled.
5,Just what was needed,"A 25 pack of 8.5 X 11 B%W photo paper. This is Ilford Multigrade IV fiber paper, not the RC (Resin coated)that is more commonly used. If your buying for the first time for a class do double check what is required. I required it for my class as it's an Art photography class and we will be exhibiting final work. I use the fiber for my final enlargements and RC for my contact sheets.As the description says, fiber has a look all it's own and processing drying is not as easy as RC for the inexperienced.As with anything you order - take a few minutes to read exactly what your getting."
2,Wrong Order,"If you are taking a photography, double-check ALL of the photo enlarging paper specifications that the instructor provided BEFORE ordering this. I actually needed RC paper, but I didn't realize that this was fiber paper. I tried using it once and it was awful. The developing process took a half an hour longer, it never dries completely, and it curls up on the edges. Its technically supposed to be better quality, but its really intended for photographers who are NOT beginners, and aren't working on a deadline. Not great if you're new to the process, or have little patience."
5,"Run, don't walk to pick this one up","By the mid-nineties I had become completely disillusioned with rock music. The glory days of punk and new-wave seemed a distant memory, with nothing but derivative, unchalleging pablum dominating the scene. For Your Own Special Sweetheart changed all of that, giving me faith that indeed, there were still creative, driven, inspired musicians around.Get this album."
4,math-rock at it's best.,"I remember seeing these guys at the Capitol theatre in Olympia in 1993, and being blown away. It was pretty rare to see a band that tight, that smart, inspired etc... in that era in Oly. where sloppy, politically self-righteous hipsters had a tight grip on things. And we were fine with that. On ""For Your Own Special Sweetheart"" Jawbox adds something that they hadn't dabbled in before, tasteful production. Their past albums had been either poorly mixed, or way overproduced. They seem to have found the perfect middle ground for their hard hitting brand of smart-punk. These graduate degree having four tear it up as they always have; with amazing melodies, brilliant lyrics, and the typical west coast dirty-punk stops and starts. I think back to that show in Oly. whenever I hear them....andI'm an 18 year old all over again; pogo-ing, loving every punk rock minute."
4,"Despite the album cover, one of the better albums of the 90s.","This album was what got me into alternative music. I saw the video for ""Savory"" on MTV back when they played music, and I was hooked. The album cover is terrible, but there are tons of fantastic songs on this album in addition to ""Savory"": ""Reel"", ""Cooling Card"", ""Motorist"", etc. The mid- and early-90s were one of the best periods of music of the past few decades, and if you want a great example of an album from this period, get this one."
3,good,"Jawbox were one of those countless bands who made it big after Nirvana opened the floodgates for hard rock and punk.This band has their instincts in the right place: they create a blistering punk-funk that has dissonance at times recalling Beefheart. This stuff is loud enough to rock the building and terrorize the catThe audio is another matter. It has that flat digital sound that got pervasive in the 1990s. Even at pumped decibels, this stuff sounds a little tinny. Go back twenty years and throw this on a slab of good wax, or remaster it with 20-bit, and you would REALLY have something."
5,A wonderful find,This jazzy trio is truly lovely. This cd is beautifully composed. It made me and my four year old daughter dance and twirl. It was a great discovery and it will be played often. Well done.
5,If your child has been diagnosed autistic...,"If your child has been diagnosed autistic, this is THE book you should read first in learning what can be done to help your child. Autism IS treatable and even in some cases, curable. There are biomedical interventions (described in the book) which have produced stunning improvements in many children - my own grandchild included.(...)"
1,The Small Town America You Should Drive Through,"If moronic men and cruelty to animals is your cup of tea, than this book is for you. Many of the inhabitants of this small town are the type you hope not to have to cope with in real life. My advice - don't stop - keep on driving!"
5,Great guide,"We have a 300+ year old sugar maple in our back yard. For the past few years we have tapped it each spring and boiled down the sap for the best maple syrup! This wonderful little ""how-to guide"" has given us a lot of pointers and info we were not aware of before. Easy to read and understand too. Just a nice little reference book."
5,Backyard Sugaring - How to,A great book for the beginner. Gives ideas of what to do and how to doit in the cheapest way possible and end up with a yummy product.
3,Definitely done in the back yard,"This book is well... not my taste. Yes they show you how to do sugaring on budget and i mean a shoestring budget. The things they have in here is nothing i would personally use myself. I thought this book would actually teach a person more about the process of maple sugaring yet, the author only seems to worry about being cheap. Its a good book for the person who doesn't want to put much into their maple syrup operation but not for the person looking to make it into a business."
5,backyard sugarin,this is a great book even if your not a beginner talks very plain and simple takes you from a to z you'll be sugarin in no time
2,POOR QUALITY....USELESS JUNK,"I purchased this changing table from Amazon because it matched our crib. What a MISTAKE!!!! The worksmanship of this table is very poor. The 2 sides pieces are held together by wooden pegs and wood glue. Most of the pegs were already broken, therefore the table was ""wobbly"". The finish scratches off just by running anything against the wood. Save your money...don't purchase this table!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Falsely advertised and flimsy,"We got this table from our registry to match the Emily crib. Wish I'd read the reviews more closely. The product at the time I added it to our registry was advertised as solid wood. It is full of MDF/Pressed wood with very little actual solid wood. The product description still does not state this.The table had several flaws in the production (missing holes for screws, etc). Upon following instructions exactly, it ended up having four cracks in it by the time we put it together. Totally flimsy. My husband and I debated returning it, but we'd spent so long putting it together that we decided against it. My advice would be to think twice, though. Its hard to come by a good changing table that is solid wood in this price range, so I'd suggest looking at something made of another product. With this table, you'll get an Ikea-quality product."
4,DaVinci Emily Changing Table,"I have been pleased with this changing table so far. It was easy to assemble and matches our crib nicely (Graco Ashleigh 4-in-1 Dropside Crib). I assumed that since this is supposed to be a higher-end changing table that the shelves would be more substantial, but they are just like the cheap, reinforced cardboard on lower-end changing tables. The changing pad is also very flimsy, so I would recommend purchasing one separately for when your child gets older and weighs more. I do like the added feature of the built-in drawer for stashing diapers, lap pads, bum creams, etc. All-in-all, it's a nice changing table. And I was glad to get it cheaper on Amazon."
3,Disappointed,"For the price, I expected the table to be higher quality. You can see the cheap shelf panels from the side and the shelves are very thin and not sturdy. Also, the directions for putting it together are very confusing and not thorough."
2,Just OK,"I have the set of DaVinci Emily furniture (crib, dresser and changing table). The crib is the highest quality piece of the set-very sturdy and well made. The dresser is not bad-we had some trouble putting it together because of confusing directions, and a couple of the drawers don't fit as snugly as they could, but overall not a bad piece for a child's room. The changing table itself it decent and seems to be sturdy enough-although my child is only 7mos. and under 20lbs. at this point. The drawer is a joke-cheap materials and craftsmanship-it was a nightmare to assembly because the screws didn't line up with the drill holes. It never really worked, and eventually after coming apart so many times we just removed it. I do miss the drawer, but it can function well enough with just the two shelves."
5,Beautiful Buy,"I debated long and hard over this purchase, but there was no need for that! It's very pretty, and we think it's an excellent buy. We had no problem with the plastic pegs, and nothing was broken or scratched in the least on arrival. My husband got it together quickly. It's more sturdy and more elegant than I expected, and the shelves are plywood, but it doesn't show. We just set up the table, but we're pretty sure it will be great."
4,Great Addition to room,"We bought this changing table to match the DaVinci Kalani crib. The first one we received was stratched and broken. I returned it and received another in less than a week. The return was very easy, and the 2nd one we received was fine. My only complaints are when you tighten the screws too much it splits the wood on the inside and also the wooden pegs on the drawer did not line up very well. I had to squeeze them with pliers and forced them in to the holes, and it went together."
2,Vey Cheap material.,"Not Sturdy at all. Quality it's terrible. 2 of the shelfs are discolored, how can they sell something new and it look used. The design is beautiful, but I don't think it's going to be useful because the shelfs are thin as paper. Sorry I won't buy this product ever again."
4,"Quick shipping, Love the color, overall pleased","The item arrived in Manufacturer's packaging, each piece was adequately wrapped, but one piece still arrived damaged. I was able to repair it, so i am still happy with the product. I put it together in about an hour, the instructions were terrible, but I was able to figure them out. Overall the product seems sturdy enough, and for the included changing pad that people have complained about not being able to find a cover for, I used a king sized pillow sham and it fit perfectly!"
5,great,its a wonderful movie i love it her attitude is great its a very very very funny movie get this movie to watch
4,Not great at staying clean,The top part of broiler has so many edges/angles that it is hard to keep clean.when washed in dishwasher not everything comes off :o(
1,i agree with prank puller,now im only a kid and you people may think im pointless but thhe lead singers vioce gets to you of cource if your deaf then it would be okay.
3,Average,"Couldn't really get into this one...although car underwater is an awesome song. WTDWYAD is a concept album, and because of that, feels confined. Half of the songs open with ""now I'm in your basement"" or ""now I'm so and so"". Like I said, confined. I'm giving it a couple additional spins just to see if I missed anything, but I doubt it. Hopefully their next release will be more in the vein of ""dream to make believe"", an album without a concept."
5,i love this band!,i was highly anticipating this cd and hoping that it'd be as good as their first... even though i knew it would be. once i heard car underwater on purevolume i knew this was going to be an incredible album. contrary to the review that says the concept idea doesn't seem to work- it did. i love the story that this album tells and i love every song on here. buy this now!
4,AFS gets a little less melodic,"First off, I really enjoy the fact that their records revolve around themes. It makes for an interesting listen. I really enjoyed Dream to Make Believe and they are a energetic band live. I pre-ordered this cd and was very excited when it came in the mail the day it came out. Armor for Sleep's new album is a little less melodic, but nevertheless a pleasent listen. It lacked chorsuses that I could really get into. But there were exceptions. For instance, Car Underwater, The Truth About Heaven, and Basement Ghost Singing (My Favorite on the album). Overall, it is a good album and I would recommend it. Also the cover art is really awesome!"
5,fantabulous,one of the greatest cd's in my collection....definately worth a listenlike MCR?you'll love this
4,Good album - but nothing special,"This album like many rock/emo albums is good, but there is nothing innovative about it, some very catchy tunes, good singing, nice rhythm. Awesome to listen to. Worth the buy."
1,they fail,"armor for sleep fails to make a second cd, there first was amazing this is just disspionting"
3,it could have been better,This cd could have been better all songs sound the same. The singers voice is kind of whiney. The cd would have been better if all the songs didn't have the same sound to it. Hope this helps someone.
3,Trying too hard,"I really wanted to like this cd because I heard Armor for Sleep was a good band that and because I didn't want to know that I just wasted 20 bucks for a lame cd. All the songs are pretty good until you get to number 6 I don't even waste my time knowing the names of this cd. 5/11 is a pretty bad ratio, but I gave them 3 stars because the first 5 I really like and I can stand the other 6. They just don't make me want to beat somebody up or crash my car into a ditch then laugh about it like the other songs do. I you want to give this cd a try just have someone burn it for you and even if you have 20 bucks don't get it. Just steal it or wait for one of your friends to pick it up so you can mooch it off them."
4,"Good Stuff, No Matter What","When this CD first came out, I was strapped for cash, so I read all of the online reviews of it to decide whether I needed to purchase it or not. Seems like all the people that rushed out and bought it the first day were the ones that cried most over it. These are the people that loved Dream to Make Believe so damn much that they would have bought What to Do When You're Dead no matter what. It didn't live up to their expectations.Because of these comments, I put off on listening to it until someone offered me a trade and I ended up with it. On first listen, I wasn't too impressed, but then again... I never am the first time around. All I can say is that if you don't give this record a chance, then that's really too bad for you. No dissappointments here."
5,Pure Brilliance,"This, In my opinion is better than the first album Armor For Sleep came out with, Dream To Make Believe is awesome, But they have done it just as great as the first time around, This album is just awesome, It showcases someone who has passed on, And still leaving behind the Love of their life down on Earth, Very touching songs if you have or are going through that experience.. So I highly recommend this album.. Just check it out, You wont be dissapointed.."
4,Awesome cd,This cd is amaazing. from start to finish. its like going into another world. this one and their first one are both so good. GET 'EM!!
3,a little better that the first,"i love the music in this cd, like anberlin a great band but, anberlin has one thing armor for sleep dosent have a good singer. that like the last album is the major turn off in liking this one alright i know most emo freaks whont mind but it is just not nessesary to sound that badgo state!!"
3,Doesn't make me sleepy!,"I think this band is pretty good I especially like the first song it has good beat. Some of the songs are slower but still good songs. I was trying to think of someone to compare this band to but I really couldn't think of any. I think if you like this band you would like a band called Forgetting Paris they are a band from Charleston,Illinois look them up on there website forgettingparis.com."
2,nope!,I agree wih the kid. There last cd was tuly wonderful and this is a set back. i think they should work out a better approach to amaze us with there stuff. i hope they learn that they should try to make it more like there first wich was a steller rookie release.
3,Dammit!,"Why dammit you ask? Well im saying dammit because i bought this cd... you may wonder why thats so bad, its only $14... my policy is dont buy a cd unless that cd is really good, I took a big leap by buying this cd, guess i didnt leap high enough. I'm not particulary disappointed with this album but I'm just pissed that i wasted money on it when i could've bought a good metalcore cd or something. getting to the album now... if you like emo music this album is good if you dont like emo music its boring... but overall in my opinion its a good cd, not excellent but good... kinda mediocre actually. ok ok, this album is caught somewhere in between good and mediocre."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I don't know what's going on. But one day, the back of my throat just broke out in this horrendous rash which scared the %$#$ out of me. It wasn't tonsillitis which I've had before. Warm salt water usually does the trick in that case. This was different. Nothing worked. Antibiotics didn't work & this didn't work. Not only does this taste horrible. It did nothing for my throat. I'm still suffering. Hopefully, I can find something to take care of it."
1,Horrible taste. mouthful of licorice,"I had th throw away the content and use the spray with propolis tincture that does not have any addons, since the taste was unbearable. I suspect it is the licorice or maybe another one of the plants that changes the pleasant taste of propolis to this bitter stinging unbelievably unpleasant concoction.I can't comment on it's curative effects since I could not tolerate it beyond 2 applications."
3,disapointed in production quality,I was so looking forward to this since she was raised to sainthood this year and wanted to show this to school kids. As an adult I had a hard time staying focused due to the slow moving nature of the presentation. It will not work for children under 10 years-old. The costuming looks high schoolish and the dialog is very difficult to understand.
5,Well Done!,"This DVD is a wonderful attempt to explain the life of Kateri Tekakwitha. It is part acted and part documentary, very interesting to devotees of soon-to-be Saint Kateri. We need to know about the lives of heroic holy people to give us inspiration and encouragement to follow the way of Jesus Christ. Kateri fulfills this well."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to watching this DVD, but was very disappointed. The documentary appears to have been done on a very low budget, and is poorly written, poorly filmed, and poorly acted. The actors wear wigs, which look fake, and the actors don't appear to be even a little Native American. The scenery is beautiful at times, at other times it seems out of place (i.e. not quite the scenery that Kateri would have known). Native Americans are referred to as ""heathens,"" a disturbingly derogatory name by today's standards. I'm sure the producers meant well, but the DVD just isn't worth the money. The DVD gets two stars instead of one simply because it's about Saint Kateri."
4,Very good product,"I have owned numerous pairs of these safety glasses.They hold up well to abuse. The only issue I have had was with the packaging. The glasses had a small rub mark from the package on the lens from handling. It wasnt in my line of sight so it wasnt an issue. There needs to be some more distance or something added to the package to keep this from happening because it could of been worse,"
4,Review,The safety Bifocals were as expected. They are well made and the cost was low. I will purchase more in the future.
2,not as robust as I had hoped,"I ordered 2 pair, one arrived broken. The break was at the side of the top frame, where the shape changes."
2,not for me,I wanted something for general carpentry type work and 99% of the time I don't need magnifiers just safety glasses. These glasses put the magnifier too high so that they interfere with distance vision 99% of the time and are too strong when I do need them for the other 1%. May be perfect for some jobs and some other eyes but no good for me.
5,great for piddling around the garage,Good idea for us with presbyopia (old eyes). Don't have to constantly put on and take off my cheater glasses when needing safety goggles.
1,Don't bye,The glasses were not molded correctly they were bent so they would not sit on your face right good idea bad followtfollowthrough
4,EXTREMELY RARE! A MUST FOR TITANIC BUFFS!,Very good film on the Titanic unlike all those other titanic films! A MUST for Titanic buffs!
3,Keely and Scura's Disaster is a Disaster,"As with the Titanic Chronicles the cover art is a disaster. I could not tell one video from the other. Do yourself a favor and wait for the special edition VHS and DVD from Arrow Video, including a limited edition collectible cover."
3,A quick read,"Girl Talk is a sassy take on finding yourself amid the morass of middle-class America, and begs the question: Can you ever avoid becoming your mother? Lissy and her mom's characters are both plucky and vulnerable, yet all the characters in this book could stand to have a little more depth. Baggot is right on, though, with the sardonically, whimsical stripper, Kitty Hawk. You'll tear through this book if you identify with Lissy or if you're a child of the 70s, but you may walk away wishing it had been a little more weighty."
1,didn't hold my attention...,"I bought this book b/c I thought it would be the perfect summer read and I was going to be traveling alot. Something to read on a long flight, perhaps. This book really did disappoint me. The characters were shallow and two dimensional, and the plot was hackneyed and quite frankly, boring. In fact, I almost gave up half way through. The most annoying thing about this book is that it was trying so hard to be ""fun"" and ""deep"" at the same time. Frankly, it doesn't succeed too well at either. A pretty pink cover and a gimmicky title do not a good book make. Baggott seems to know how to market herself, but that's about all."
2,Didn't hold my attention....,"I wanted to like this book very much since I had heard such positive things about it. I bought this book to read on a long plane ride, since it's been touted as the perfect summer read.The book just didn't hold my attention. I found the characters to be mildly annoying and the plot predictable and cheesy. It reads as though she wrote it in a very short period of time and was trying to be ""fun"" and ""deep"" at the same time. Unfortunately it fails at both.I don't really like to write bad reviews, but it does annoy me when something has so much hype attached to it and the product turns out to be disappointing.If you insist on buying it, at least buy it used."
5,Beautifully written,"Gorgeous book, just beautifully written. Some of Ms. Baggott's images are so wonderful - I specifically loved the idea of Lissy's mother telling her her 'truths' like a mafia don opening up his violin case and displaying his gun.There are so many beautiful scenes in this book, and so many heart-wrenching moments it was hard for me to believe this is Ms. Baggott's first novel. You can, however, tell she is a poet as her fiction cries out like a poem.I can't say enough about this book. Lissy captured my heart from the very first chapter and I loved her and her crazy mother so much that I read the book in one sitting (just over 4 hours), because I was desperate to find out what happened.You will not be disappointed if you buy this book."
4,a great read,"Girl Talk is a very good book! Lissy is 30, single and pregnant which is the same position her mother was in once. In Girl Talk, Lissy tell the tale of the summer that never existed. It's the summer her father ran off with another woman for the summer. Lissy and her mom go and stay with the aunt and uncle of her mom's first love. Lissy does a lot of growing up over the summer. She finds out the truth about her father and her mother tells her her story. Although the book jumps from one story to another, it isn't hard to follow and had me laughing out loud at points."
2,Life's too short,"I felt totally ambivalent while I was reading this book. The characters didn't seem like real people to me, and I just thought the story wasn't interesing. I could have finished it without too much trouble, but I thought, what's the point? Don't waste your time on this book. Life is short. Spend it reading something really good."
4,-----_____----- (picture that),"Picture the book as that graph I made above. I'd say the beginning was great, the characters wonderful, deep, coming aware, interesting. Church and the protaganist were quite a dysfunctional match. The middle was very good (sorry if the graph depicts a bottom, but that is not the case). I view the middle as giving me too much repetitive information, in other words, it kind of slowed. Not to say that it was bad and I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression because I enjoyed this book immensely.The ending rocked! It was black and ironic, just the way I like it. I'd recommend the book."
1,Boring and dull,"I've read several of Baggott's novels, written under her alias Bridget Asher, and found them cute, quirky and a lot of fun. They were definitively chick lit. This book was, frankly, boring. I try to finish every book I start and the only good thing about this book was that it only took a few hours to read. The characters were dysfunctional, and not in the kind of way that makes you want them to succeed. I didn't care what happened to them, I just wanted it all to end. She also seems to have a strange fixation with ""Ivy league education,"" as that phrase came up repeatedly. The constant going back and forth in time annoyed me, and I usually love books that do that. This was a complete waste of time."
5,one to get happily lost in,"the narrative tone of this book takes me back to my infatuation with the series ""my so-called life."" the characters are alive and the author tells this story in a comforable, familiar way that makes me crave for more! bravo to baggott!!"
5,A great introduction to a great pioneer,"Jean Ritchie's story has an almost mythic quality about it.Raised in Appalachian Kentucky, she got her college degree andmoved to New York to help in the inner-city. There folks discovered her knowledge of the folk songs and mountain dulcimer music with which she was raised. She's often been credited with being the person who brought the mountain dulcimer to the attention of the broader public.This collection of songs chooses a broad selection, commencing from her very first album to her later work. The songs here emphasize vocals, not dulcimer, so that is not a ""Hendrix of the dulcimer"" approach to this music. The spare, two and four track productions have an enchanting ""live"" quality, and Ms. Ritchie's voice has an appealing sincerity.This CD is a very worthwhile introduction to her work. I highly recommend."
3,Puzzle,"This puzzle has turned out to be much more difficult than any other puzzle we have ever attempted other than a three D puzzle. But, we do like the challenge and it is coming along--if much slower than we expected."
5,The heart of France.,This is the best of Mathieu. It brings to one's heart the memories of France both past and present. To listen to it is to know France.
5,Just wonderful - a real dream!,"In 2012 a new release of the ""chante Piaf""-album which contains two absolutely new recorded songs (July 2012) by la Mathieu: ""A quoi ca sert l'amour"" and ""La goualante du pauvre Jean"". Extended with the 1985 recording of ""Les trois cloches"", you find on this product 16 songs par excellence. The voice of Miss Mathieu is one of the best ever in the world; she's absolutely popular in my country (Germany) as in the most countries of good old Europe and this has a reason: Her quality, her feeling for the music, her brillant voice which for me is the best ever(!) of all female artists.Listen to these songs, they all are so wonderful and joyful. This CD is a real gift!"
3,Very Traditional,"This is a collection of songs that Edith Piaf was famous for, redone with all the splendour of Mireille's studio team. I think her voice is better than Edith, but I find the strong French inflection she uses a little grating. She's tried too hard to sound like Piaf and not her usual self. Still, very nice."
1,At least she tried,"I'm sorry to say it but this album is just too much. For sure I don't have anything against Mme. Mathieu but to listen to this album makes me icredibley sad and for sure many other admireres of Piaf as well. Just to say that Mathieu did for sure her utmost to make this a ""good"" album. Many, especially outside of France think she sucseeded, me for sure I don't think so. For Mathieu Fans only - otherwise buy the original!"
5,Toujours formidable,"I may be biased as Mireille is my favorite singer, but the power and emotion does these songs justice. You cannot miss with this album."
1,Hyundia 2011 key,"This key doesnt work for the Hyundia Santa fa 2011. The web site told me wrong. I called and told them and they said it would work. It does not. I went to a locksmith, the locksmith said this is the wrong key they sold youThey made me pay for shipping to get it now, They also want me to pau for return shipping. I would not buy from this company. It was there mistake and I have to pay for it. The people on the phone spoke poor English. They didnt want to help me at all for there mistake."
5,¿te habías dadp cuenta de que no eres libre?,"¡Qué libro tan inteligente y lleno de calidad humana ! Nos permite darnos cuenta de que, SI DEPENDEMOS DE ALGO O DE ALGUIEN ¡NO SOMOS LIBRES ! Este dependencia puede ser con respecto a una persona o a una adicción...hay quienes no 'podemos tomar ni una decisión sencilla sin la opinión de mamá, de pa'pá, del esposo o la mujer.. Eso, amigos, NO ES SER LIBRE ! Otros, sentimos que nos volvemos locos si se nos acaban los cigarros...o muchas veces, el alcohol! El primer derecho del ser humano..es LA LIBERTAD !"
4,Needs a lid!,My daughter loves this set however it is terrible to store because it doesn't have a lid to hold all the pieces in.
3,disappointed,"My 4 year old and 21 month old received this as a Christmas present. I love the set, but am disappointed in the quality of the wood. Already some of the small wooden logs are chipped and the white coral pieces are either hard to put in the little holes, or are too easy and slip out, making it hard for the coral to stay together. There are pretty much only enough pieces to build the two buildings in the directions and not enough to build anything else, but we plan to buy more sets/pieces in the future. They look like they would be interchangeable with other lincoln log sets. As for the other review, we just put a cut piece of cardboard over the top as a lid. Eventually, we'll probably end up dumping them all into a different container anyway."
1,Hactch mix not easy,"OK it came fast but this product is not as easy as it claims. first it says ""just add water and wait. You have to add water and keep the water at at least 80 degrees and it recommend to keep Ph at a certain level. So in hence you need some kind of container that can do all of this, which i don't have. I put the eggs in a container and put the container in my 40gal tank then waited for 2days, I seen ""some"" eggs hatch but it was still mostly eggs after 3 days. So this product is not what it claims and i am not happy with the results. Unless you have all the tools it takes to do this then don't buy."
1,Dubious piece of historical revisionism,"Absolute crap. I seriously question whether the author was, as he says, a member of the waffen ss. His excuse for not having the customary tattoo under the armpit is that he was sick the day they gave those. His uniform is suspect. His claims of not hearing one single anti-semetic remark are rather interesting considering the other books on the Waffen SS I've read.His ridiculous holocaust denial nonsense is irritating. His claims that dead Jews (tens of thousands, historical fact) found sprawled around the grounds of concentration camps were, in fact, victims of allied bombing raids and starved by the allies!The author is persona non grata in Germany, and ranks up there with Ernst Zundel and other loonie Hitler admirerers.This book is peppered with his anti-Jewish sentiment. Sure, whatever.I want my money back!!!!By the way- the author saw only about 3 months of combat duty in total. Doubt he fired a single shot."
1,Long Day's Journey Into Night,"Dull and biased. For those interested in the harsh realities of soldiers in combat, this book is not for you. As a teenage recruit towards the end of the war, Hans' combat experience is limited to minutes, as he is wounded on two occasions just as the fighting commences. What is left then to fill a good part of the book is a long, unconvincing apologia for Nazism and rants against World Jewry and, if you can believe it, General Eisenhower. It is rather sad that he dismisses Nazi barbarity as exaggeration or misinformation while conveniently assigning malevolent intent to all those who opposed his beloved Reich."
5,Great Book,"Having read hundreds of books on WWII and spent my adult life studying this war, I found this book very interesting and unique. It tells what the war was like from the German perspective and also brings into question many of the things we have been taught. War history is written by the victors and always slanted in their favor. This book trys to explain that in this war, crimes and atrocities were committed by both sides. The author ties many of these ideas and themes into current events and tells how WWII continues to hold sway over things, even today. The author questions have caused him trouble in his homeland, Germany, where it is a crime to question many of the events that took place during the war."
5,J'Accuse,"Born in 1927 and, quite obviously, a well conditioned product of the National Socialist State, the author presents a clear and honest memoir of and insight into his wartime and post war experiences up to his emigration to the United States. Though one would and could question his view as pertaining to the Halocaust as being revisionist, the veracity of his presentation on the treatment of the German Military and Civilian population by the United States and the Allies is not. (...)Hans Schmidt's book is a sad comment on his time and on our own."
2,Tryin' to be objective,"I like to read memoirs and personal narratives from WW2 soldiers of all nations involved. I really enjoyed reading ""The Good Soldier"", 'Black Edelweiss"" and ""Five Years, four fronts"".This book, ""SS Panzergrenadier"" is simply a piece of crap. Because it cost me so much money I will keep it on the shelf but will only use it as a reference when someone askes me ""just how arrogant, self-serving and distorted were some SS soldiers during WW2""? Hans Schmidt, you are a zero."
3,A PERSPECTIVE,"The book is very well written , easy to read . Its strength lie in its vivid descriptions of the authors feelings, training and action at the end of WWII in Belguim , Hunagary and Austria. Whilst he raises legitimate concerns around the treatment of German POWs and other issues it is marred by some comments such as ""the so called holocaust"". If one is able to ignore such statements it is a good read , but it was a unfortunate imclusion and distraction for me. But then they are not my memiors"
2,A German viewpoint,"This is an autobiography of a young SS soldier during the last two years of the war. He tells his experience that is contrary to our perception of the Third Reich, and in particular how strict the German military was regarding either rape or looting. Both were capital crimes.It corresponds to what my cousins and acquaintences, veterans of the wehrmacht, told me on the same subject. They did not dare loot or rape as one cousin put it.You also get an idea on the ideals of that society."
4,Provocative,"The book is well written, I assume it is an autobiography. I am suprised that one of the well known Generals in Waffen SS was not mentioned; that is General Leon Degrelle, who faught on the Eastern Front. Also not mentioned was the bombing of Dresden that took over 170,000 lives. In addition there were many other nationalities that joined Waffen SS, some of my older countrymen in Slovakia have joined. At that time due to my age of 7, I was a member of Hlinka Youth. Would like to hear from the author by E-Mail."
2,Remember That College Textbook You Just Hated?,"I started out as a lit major, then switched to linguistics. I worked three years as a medical transcriptionist. I've never had trouble reading anything. But this book is so full of fourteen-letter words, acronyms, and other jargon, it's just plain unpleasant to read.The information is sound, and definitely interesting. But if you just want to understand the physiology of trauma, read the first section of Levine's ""Waking The Tiger"" instead (the rest of the book is rhetoric); it's a quick and easy read and presents the same basic information.And if you're a PTSD sufferer, this is definitely not the book for you! It's written by an M.D. for those interested in the physical aspects of trauma, but offers absolutely no help (or even resources) for trauma patients. Try one of the breathing books or tapes by Gay Hendricks. Hendricks addresses releasing trauma directly and clearly."
5,Great System!,"Bought it down at Walmart, not expecting much. But wow!!! Good sound, good bass, just good. Nothing amazing, but it is a very solid system for a very good price. Highly suggested."
1,rather unfortunate,"i was so interested in getting one because a colleague was using it and i liked the sound,but with the one i bought it really sounds bad,especially the hoofer.i kind of think i waisted my money.let me know if there's something i can do."
3,Came Up Short,This clamp is advertized as coming with a short stud. Mine arrived with no stud. I am unhappy about that.
3,It does not hold up well to occasional use!!!,Bought it to try it out and was pleased with the performance until I threw it about 10 times has some bad gashes on it mad it never hit anything but grass and the chains!!! Not durable at all!!!
4,Aerodynamics,"This is a wonderful disc, not so much for beginners because you REALLY need to get a good spin on it or it instantly turns over. If you get the snap right It goes mega straight until it slows down. The coolest part is that the air foils cause it to whistle if you throw it with a lot of power. I love it."
2,When colors are boring,I was so looking forward to receiving this book that when it arrived I immediately started to read. What a disappointment. It was full of fairly useless information and not at all entertaining or a joy to read which I'd expected it to be. I've given it a rating of 2 but had to think long and hard to even go that high.
1,"Beware, beware","Ditto to the previous one-star review. Not only do you get just one pen, you can't even choose the color!! Very misleading listing."
3,Need it or no?,"This book has a lot of good pointers, especially if you have never travelled on a motorcycle before. I have done quite a bit of traveling and was looking for help in foreign motorcycle travel. I live in the USA and will be travelling south of the border so this book didn't offer much help. It would be helpful if you were in Europe and planning to travel around Europe or into Africa by motorcycle. For New Worlders, however, this book is quite lacking. There are better books out there for travelling in Central and South America."
4,Really good book,It s really a good book. A lot of info important for your trip you can find all in one place. You can also find which bike to chose for your trip.I liked trick and tips for better ride but I wish it was more about it.Anyway really a good one. Thumb up!
3,half of the book are strories written by other riders,and one of them left bad taste... the guy was riding in Africa with the author of the book and a buddy and had tire problem (tubes he put in were getting punctured after some miles). He was simply left out by his partners to deal with his problem and had some hard time when run out of spares .. It makes me wonder if author consider this story is good for his book what are the other ones..there is some useful info in the book though... especially bike comparison
3,Display Disappointment,"I love the concept of preview and the option to select multiple prints. Yet, the display screen is much too small and impossible to see in sunlight. I was going to return the camera until I got my film developed and saw the wonderful pictures the camera did provide."
3,Needs more directions,I still do not know how to use the self-timer or where it even is after a year.Is there a remote that goes to this camera?Also the skin tones are too light sometimes.How can I avoid too light with the auto flash and could someone tell me how the autoflash works.Friends like it however.Too small a view finder.Why is it you can never get all the features you want in one camera?Why not a big view finder on all cameras?I lose shots trying to focus with the tiny view finder.
3,"Great concept, decent photos, but a few problems.","I bought this camera specifically for a recent vacation overseas. Overall, it's a decent Kodak product - the pictures came out well enough, it was very easy to load and the three-size option was great.BUT, I was disappointed when, on several occasions, the zoom lens got stuck and I had a hard time getting it to retract. Also, it's often hard to examine the image on screen when out in broad daylight (and indoors, it often looks very dark, even though the photos subsequently came out just fine).What it comes down to is, it's got some cool features, but had I known the problems I'd encounter, I would never have spent this much money."
3,Didn't meet expectations,"On several fronts, this didn't meet my expectations. The display quality is far inferior to what I expected - the pictures even on the box had to have been retouched because they were far clearer than anything I saw! I waited until I had developed two rolls of film using this camera, and was not impressed with the picture quality. For close-up pictures, it was not bad - about equal with any other point and shoot. For distance pictures, however, I found the quality poor."
4,The small problem with the preview camera,"The kodak preview camera is one of the most innovative camera's on the market. and when you are using it. you are sure to get many admirer's. My small problem with this camera is with the view finder, and that IS the problem. The viewfinder is VERY small. Myself and other's really had a hard time seeing through it. I'm hoping kodak will address this problem soon."
3,"Not a digital camera, but not bad APS.","This is a pretty good APS camera, but nothing extraordinary. The 'preview' screen allows you to see a small, low resolution image of the picture you have just taken. From that glimpse you can decide whether to encode the APS film with a 'do not print' instruction to the processor, you can order multiple prints and you can change the format (like from std to panoramic). [Please be aware, though, that not all film processors have the equipment to process this extra data, and in many cases it counts for naught] You cannot store the image (as on a SmartMedia or CompactFlash card) to view later or to download to your PC. You can only look at the last photo you've taken and then only on the tiny screen (there is no 'video out' that would allow you to preview it on a TV or PC screen). However, as the price has fallen, this extra digital trick has become a fairly justifiable and certainly an innovative addition to an APS camera."
3,Too Bulky,"I bought this camera because of its unique Preview feature that is usually only available on digital cameras. The feature was indeed very useful, although the screen is not of the best quality and you can't see many details. But you get the idea of what your picture will look like. The rest of the features are standard on all APS cameras.I didn't think that the quality of the pictures was very good. Some of them had a greenish tint to them, but they were in pretty good focus. One of the biggest reasons that I didn't keep this camera is that it's too bulky for this day and age. It's about double the size of the Canon Z3 APS camera, which has all of the features besides the preview.So, buy this camera only if the size is not important to you, but the Preview is and you don't want to get a digital."
1,Save your money,"I have found this camera more trouble than it is worth. This is primarily for 2 reasons: 1) the pictures are significantly grainier than a single lens camera, and 2) I have yet to find a developer who has the upgraded kodak equipment needed to develop the film properly and who has actually heard of the technology. I have gone to lengths to utilize the many features of the camera, only to have various kodak developers not be able to complete the job."
3,Okay Bumper Pool Table,"Solid wood means particle board, plywood and some kind on non-descript wood for the diagonal legs. The bumpers are not very lively and are made of plastic. Everything is covered in wood grain plastic wrap. The slate top is nice but it is covered with an odd fabric that is not felt. All in all the extra money may be justified for the Valley Tiger Cat or the All American tables."
1,My girlfriend got pregnant.,"Durex condoms kick ass, if you're Catholic and don't believe in contraception. Seriously, I would have been better off using a screen door as contraception than using these worthless latex sheaths. I'm a little bitter, but the fact remains that while I was wearing a Durex condom I got a girl pregnant.It's a boy."
4,Heritage apples,"When I decided to plant some apple trees, I wanted apples I couldn't buy at the local grocery store. Information on antique varieties was hard to find, but this little book was a treasure trove. I kept it beside me as I went through my catalogs, comparing those descriptions to Yepsen's text and beautiful illustrations of both antiques and some modern varieties. Very useful, and a pleasure for the eyes as well. The only improvement I could ask for is that it would cover more apples. Perhaps another volume?"
5,From bad to worse,"Whenever you think your life is bad, pick up a Zola novel.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a happy ending, but if you're the twisted sort who loves reading up on other people's misery (e.g. Dostoevsky, Kafka or Flannery O'Connor), then dig in.And if you've ever read Frank Norris's ""McTeague"" and liked it, then you should know that Zola was his biggest influence.You start off with a family hovering on the brink of ruin in the slums of Paris. Could it get worse? Oh yes, and how! Increase the levels of alcohol and poverty (the characters', that is, not yours), sit back and watch.I can't vouch for the translation, but you'll be reaching for the sequel (and God knows there were plenty) once you finish this sordid tale."
3,"A good book, but reads a little slow","The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane is a good book if you are willing to struggle through the slow parts. This book is not about the strategy and history of the Civil War from the view of the commanding generals. Instead, it is about the physiological effects of battle had on an ordinary soldier, Henry Flemming. Crane is able to talk describe the battles very well for someone who hadn't yet witnessed a war. The book can give you a feeling of the sheer horror of battle and total boredom of the time in camp. Unfortunately Crane drags out story and often repeats himself. Some parts of the story line are pretty weak. I think this book would interest someone more interested in the mental impacts of the Civil War."
2,Only good part in this book is at the end,"The only good part of this book is at the end when theres fighting. The rest of the book is very boring and its hard not to fall asleep when you're reading this novel. Besides the end, theres hardly any drama and theres no lessons that can really be learned from this book. If all you people want to go out and buy thats fine. However, Im just warning you that its a waste of money and not worth your time."
1,If you want to read a book about a bunch of guys marching...,"Stephen Crane takes a very interesting struggle with a young boys fears about battle and ruins it. The books begins very well but interest will soon be lost after the first actions taken by the boy. The book was incredibly hard to read, not due to difficulty of writing but to the lack of interest created."
1,No diving in shallow pages,"This was the longest 172 we have ever read. This book was boring and undescriptive. The main character's name is not even revealed until the sixth chapter of the book. And even then, the author never uses his name. If you have insomnia, this book might be your cure."
1,The worst book I ever read.,"If you are considering reading or buying this book...don't. I find wars very interesting, but this book has very little war and a lot of descriptive junk.Did you know that Stephen Crane wrote this book in 10 days? He really tried hard too (not).If you are looking for a good book on the Civil War, check out Across Five Aprils, you will like it."
2,trash,"This book is pretty bad. The first haplf of the book is very hard reading and it very hard to tell what is actually going on. In the second half, there was one good fight scene but that was about it. Henry was a coward. He wanted to be courageous but it is easier said than done. Crane wrote this book in 10 days. Did you know that? He must have been pretty dedicated to writing a classic war story (yeah right). If he actually had spent a little more time on it, than it would have been a lot better than it is. I know it. Thanks for reading!"
1,Horrible,Words cannot describe how terrible this video is. I want to burn every copy in existence. This is more like an amateur home video than a good kids' video.
1,it never arrived,"It never arrived and I still dont have an explanation, it is payed for and the adress is correct.I ordered it in september and we are in december, no one has even contacted me,"
5,Bi-Polar But Not A Parent,"I found this book to be extremly helpful and insightful. I am not a parent but do have a bi-polar mental illness.The book has shown me a way to better manage my illness. Most of the chapters deal with subjects such as how to put together a self-care plan,a crisis plan (such as going into the hospital),how to make better use of finances as well as the importance of keeping a balanced life.I believe very strongly that not only parents with a mental illness but parents without a mental illness and childless couples with or without an illness can also benefit from reading this book.This is a must read book for anyone who wants to improve any area of their life."
2,Why did it have to be like this?,"Eat Man is a great manga and I couldn't wait to see Eat Man 98. However, I was very dissapointed. Don't get me wrong, I love the entire concept of Eat Man. A guy who eats metal and turns it into a gun from his right hand is a very nice concept. And I love the woman-in-distress episodes of series (hey, it worked for City Hunter). But the artwork and action in this tape don't do Eat Man any justice is at all. Its like they took a great manga and sliced it up into crappy animation. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is for the terrific dub, though I dont think its worth buying it for. Either way, Eat Man flows the wrong way at every turn. I beg you to read the manga comic instead of waisting your money on a poorly done show like this. The character designs stink and the animation is almost impossable to bear. Avoid this one at all costs."
4,a joyride!,"If you've ever wanted to shimmy till your buns fell off, but just couldn't find the right sound to push you over that edge . . . Well, The Ghost of Tony Gold is IT. BUY THIS RECORD! Now. Your ears (and your hips) will thank you. This is happy music, party music, let-yourself-go-and-become-a-bond-girl music. I personally can't wait for their next release -- my booty's itchin to boogie in that very special ""Ghost""ly way.One star off for production. Not as good as their live show, but worth the eleven bucks nonetheless."
4,Nice book but...,I have spent a lot of money on this book which contains lots of information about bloody fighting in WW II only to realize that the author used MOSTLY american literature. It is a shame that he did not consider some japanese books also.
3,some good songs,This CD has some good takes on songs that are unavailabe any where else. For Example- No Way Jose!CD arrived Quickly.
5,An Ethical Divorce,"I found this book to be a thoughtful, reflective, highly ethical approach to divorce. This is a book that is clear and effective in assisting families in prioritizing the what and how of divorce while still maintaining integrity and personal dignity. The emphasis given on protecting children is a breath of fresh air. I feel that anyone even remotely contemplating divorce must read this book."
2,price to benefit ratio,"For the money you may want to look at other makes/models.I had a Saeco ""easy"" which I bot for 1/3 the price, it was kept on for 5 years before a small plastic piece broke.I decided to upgrade and bot this B 30, it does have more bells and whistles. If you want simple this may be it. But be aware that the beans must be tamped down almost every time for the grinder to get them.It has preset sizes only you cannot adjust the amount specifically (which the other automatic did - allowed by oz.First year it is okay, but really not for the coffee connoisseur. It just does not produce the high quality great taste I expected. Sorry Bosch it is close but no cigar."
5,Morning coffee,"I have had one of these machines for about 3 years and have now just bought a second one. I keep one in my condo in Florida and one at my home in New Mexico. The coffee grinder in the NEW one seems to allow the whole coffee beans to drop down in the grinder with no ""assistance"" from me. I tend to have to push the beans in the ""hopper"" with my fingers, forcing them in the grinder on the first machine. I didn't mind this because the end product is so delicious. I have five adult children and when we get together that thing is humming all day long. It is not the size of appliance that you haul around just anywhere, but when I travel by car, I put it in a large laundry basket and take it everywhere I go! That's how the first Bosh machine ended up in Florida . . . I drove there and flew back! I can't find a thing wrong with these devices . . . neither one of them ever skips a beat."
1,stainless steel? really?,"I'm sorry, but this item is not what I expected from the description and picture. It came boxed, but don't think it's new. There's scratches and its even bent in 2 places. Not silver stainless. Its a gold color. Can't give it as a gift so I'm stuck with it."
3,Not a whole lot of substance but a lot of fun.,"This video series is kind of a cross between ""Top Gun"" and your traditional anime love triangle. Overall the series is pretty silly but the animation is fairly good, especially the aviation scenes, and its a lot of fun if you check your brain at the door."
5,A TRUE 10 STAR BOOK & SERIES,Ms Welfonder is really a truly gifted author. I predicted withher first book that she would be an author to watch and she hasnot disappointed me. Have read all of her books so far and I amanxiously awaiting her next one to come out. If anyone likesScottish books then buy one of her books and you won't bedisappointed. I will buy all of her books.
2,Sorry to say - I was disappointed,"While I have truly enjoyed this series, I was disappointed in this book. It was 300 pages of the hero trying to fight off his feelings for the heroine while ... aroused. The story was inane and the villian was done away with in the last chapter of the book. I was literally so bored that I could barely get through the entire book.I kept waiting for the book to get better, but it didn't."
2,Couldn't finish,"Not this author's best book. Amazingly I couldn't finish this book and always, always finish every book I buy! I didn't care what happened to the characters and found the story silly. I love Highland romances and this one isn't worth reading."
4,Seems to be helping,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and it really does seem to help me breathe deeper. I have mild COPD and find adding this product to my daily supplements seems to improve my lung function. I was tempted to give it five stars, but since I've only been using it a short time I settled for four. Definitely worth trying for anyone with lung problems."
4,Compra Perfecta,"Es la compra perfecta al comparar calidad y precio, es un equipo configurado con una combinación de componentes de exelente rendimiento y reconocido desempeño, por un precio que vale la pena invertir, es una buena opción."
3,It's OK,"Not too sure about this product. The first time I didnt notice any changes really, mayeb cuzz I didnt use enough so the next time I had used ALOT, I did notice slight changes but nothing dramatic."
4,Excellent protector but OK for clearness,"Features:- Anti-Glare: Works good when screen is ON.- Fingerprint Free: You can't see them when the screen is ON but fingerprints are still there.- Dust Resistant: True for the outside (non-adhesive side). Only problem there is that the adhesive side keeps fingerprints and attracts dust so there's dust between the protector and the screen. But its not really noticable when the screen is ON.- Washable and Reusable: Seems to works.- Protects Screen from Scratches: DefinitlyWould recommand this product to everyone. Installation is fast exept if you're really maniac about the screen being fingerprint and dust free. But you won't notice both when the screen is ON.The package also includes a cleaning cloth and a ""Boxwave ClearTouch Applicator"" just a piece of ordinary cardboard that helps your remove air bubbles, not essential but helpful."
1,Terrible,This screen protector went on with a whole bunch of bubbles that would not press out. A total waste of money.
3,What you see is not what you get,"When I started reading this book, I was really hoping that it would help me shave off some of the exorbitant costs associated with weddings by allowing me to make some of my own flower arrangements. While this is a beautiful book, I can't say that it does what the title says. True, it shows a really nice and easy to make headband wreath, but that was the extent of the knowledge I got from this book. The pictures, at best, give you some ideas about flower arrangements, but some are unclear and often it seems that the scenery and the people in the pictures are the subject, instead the flowers. In a how-to flower guide I would assume that the flowers should take center stage. Overall, I would give it a C+."
2,dissapointing.,This is a very nice book with lovely pictures. However as a practical guide to creating boquets and arrangements it has little to offer.
4,'Come Fly The Unfriendly Skies...'!,"Rodney Stich is out of prison and that'sthe good news. Also, that this book atleast got circulation. All of Rodney'sbooks are worth getting, even if youmay not agree with all he says in them.Yes, some will probably always be unpr-ovable, but remember Gordon Kahl, VickyWeaver, Sam Weaver, the Waco church bunchand all those sacrificed at Pearl Harbour,Oklahoma City, and the two World TradeCentre bombings ('93 & '01)...And there'sno conspiracies, Rush Limbaugh?! I think youare wrong!"
4,An opinion,"The second part is very informative regarding the CIA informants. The first part, involving United Airlines accidents, is not completely accurate as to type of aircraft going into Lake Michigan in 1965. It was not a B720. It was a B727. The two DC8's at Detroit and Salt Lake City were freighters and the loss of life mentioned were three crew members in each case. But the CIA part certainly makes up for it with details on the October Surprise engineered by the Beagan-Bush team. Had read from other sources where G.W. Bush was involved directly in the negotiations and this confirms it."
1,Couldn't get the game to work!,We had to return the game due to it not being able to work. It'd freeze before we could get to play the game itself.
2,Not what I thought,A little disappointed with this one. I suppose the description did a good job explaining what the DVD contains but I was expecting a more refined picture and sound for a DVD. The DVD spends a lot of time showing what the Love festival is like but the sound quality and the jumpy editing detracts from the experience for me. Try the Tiesto in concert DVD if you want to focus on the music.
2,Poor quality,I was not satisfied with it. Amateur camcoders spread all-around the love parade... very shaky... novice editing work...stone-age effects... and the music is not great at all. It made me dissy. The good part of it is that there are some cute European girls in it... shaking it... right in front of the camera. Good clip if you want to see more about European culture.
5,Great!!!,"The Naruto Special Uncut Boxed Set Volume 2 is just as good as the first. This box set includes episodes 14 through 25 in their original format without suffering any cut-happy censorship and also gives the viewers the options of watching in either the original Japanese language, English dubbed or subtitles. You also can't beat the great picture and sound quality that this DVD set provides. Included within the box set is a sand village emblem bag with armband and necklace, which aren't that great but the actual DVD's themselves are worth the price. I can't wait for volume three to come out and I really hope the entire Naruto series is made into this special box edition."
4,"Rich biography, and a 1st rate study of machine politics.","Even if I wasn't a political junkie, this book would have held my attention because, politics aside, its a well-written, fascinating biography of a complicated man. AS a political junkie, I was richly rewarded reading this book. I've never read a more complete examination of the exercise of political power in America. Grondahl is a skillful, honest reporter and he has done a wonderful job with this story."
2,City desk view of Albany political machine,"Tough review of evils of political machine which did preserve peace, keep minimal governmental services going, keep taxes low and out preform the ""good"" governmental cities in the upstate NY. Hard to justify but it did work. His reporting is best contrasted with Wm. Kenedy's classic history Oh Albany."
5,Outstanding,"Paul Grondahl is a terrific writer, and his writing has never been better. This book is an extraordinarily well-researched, thorough and readable account of one of the more fascinating figures in American politics. It should be of interest to anyone fascinated by the fables and foibles of political life. John M. Caher"
1,Bad Shipment of ARTEC TEXTURE LINE MATERIAL,"I've used this styling product for years and ordered two 2 oz. jars of it on Amazon.com. The product shipped from a company called, ""Biva Beauty"". Both jars had some sort of gritty substance in them similar to a coarse sand. Totally dissatisfied with the product that was shipped."
5,Good stuff,"After trying many other products, my husband finally found this one and has been using it for about three years now. It's great for short hair, not sticky and doesn't give him that shiny look either."
4,Great for the synic at Christmas,This is an excellent CD. The songs are catchy and the quality of the music is first class. Bob Rivers may have an irreverant take on christmas but a healthy dose of synicism is always welcome. I would thouroughly recommend this ablum to anyone who wants to really laugh
4,Prepare to laugh... alot!,"If you enjoy the offbeat, this is a terrific CD. It lends quite a bit of humor to the otherwise normal songs. It's a great pick-me-up if you need one."
4,What's it to ya?,"This was Bob Rivers' second Christmas album, released seven years after his first one. The production values are better on this one and it's much longer, too. Most of the songs are quite funny. But there are some dated references to the likes of Murphy Brown, Ted Kennedy and Jacques Cousteau. Overall, though, there are quite a few laughs to be had here."
3,WALKING ROUND IN WOMENS UNDER WEAR,BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS PARTICULAR CD FOR YEARS IT IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. I AM SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND IT.
5,kicks @ss,"My aunt always complained because I didn't listen to Christmas music around the holidays. I Am Santa Claus is hilarious (first Christmas album I actually liked), and she can no longer b!tch at me. The band does a really good job of disguising the song as the original until the vocals come in too. Teddy the red nosed senator, had a very shiny car, and if you ever saw it, you were probably near a bar.... :)"
1,Disappointed,"Of all the Bob Rivers Christmas Cd's this was the worse of them. It has a one song ""Walking around in Women's underwear"" that made us laugh. The rest duds."
3,Its ok... I guess,"It was a good CD, it had some funny songs, but it wasn't as good as some of his other holiday cds"
1,Keep Looking,I just did not find that this was a state-of-the-art product. It has the navigation and feel of a late 1990's piece of software and failed to meet my expectations.
3,Questionable reviews,Two of these 5-star reviews were written by the same person over the course of two days. Another 5-star review was written on one of those days. Very suspicious -- much like the reviews for Palo Alto's Business Plan Pro software. It appears the business plans for these software companies did not include a section about ethics.
2,Not M. Forster's best,"Very long, depressing and repetitive. the author relates her father descent into old age and the character is not a nice person so it does make the reading depressing."
4,a bit of Americana,"interesting reading about something most of us eat. It is interesting to see how the companies started, the marketing and remember brands we used to eat that are now part of history."
1,Revisionist History,"Being familiar with the industry and its products through substantial research and review, I am confident in stating that much of what is written here is ""revisionist history"" and an effort to exploit Americans' understandably warm feelings toward comfortable things of their youth into an effort to glorify (if not deify) an industry that, at least indirectly, sucks government subsidies to add excessive sugar, salt, and fat to our diet than we really need. Good grief! Some of the origins of the firms are accurately reported, but short of that, this is ""Madison Avenue on steroids."""
2,Can buy these at any Dollar Tree,Just an FYI I purchased these same placemats for 1.00 esch at my local Dollar tree store.
3,Not Enough Fuzz,"I didn't love the lengthy, Eastern-esque noodling on various string instruments. If 30% of it had been replaced by distorted, fuzzed-out guitar I would give this set another star. There was plenty of music to enjoy, though, and at a price of roughly $4/disc I'm happy I bought it."
2,Packaging was in poor condition,"The doll itself was ok but the box (which is important for collectors) was bent up and in poor condition. Even had a small puncture in it. We weren't impressed, especially considering the price we paid."
1,HP ONLY!!!,"If you do not have a COLORED HP laser printer, then DO NOT purchase this product because it is for COLORED HP laser printers ONLY!! I gave it one star because it is ONLY for HP laser printers and cannot be used for other colored laser printers! It is NOT for monochrome HP laser printers! HP should invest technology so this product can be used with other brands of laser printers as they have done with their other paper product."
