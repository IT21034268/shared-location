1,the secret of being a successful stripper,"Be a zombie. Have skin rot off. Have body parts fall out. Eyes streaming down the cheeks. Break heads open. Pull legs and arms off. Fetid odors. Be the living dead. Cause in this movie, the men don't want to see beautiful young women getting naked. Those women are the castaways. Bring on the zombies--the men go crazy. It all makes such sense now.And it's on Blu-ray. Oh come on, all the great movies to pick from, and this is among the chosen. Lord, you'd think they would at least put ""Dude Where's My Car?"" on it too. Oh wait, they have. Sanity and high art seen at its finest. I'm waiting for ""Flight of the Living Dead"" personally.What is not funny is I feel so very sorry for Robert Englund. He has always deserved so much more."
3,Horrific!,"Enjoyed the humorously horrific film which keeps you laughing and horrified at the same time. For those who want to laugh and be somewhat disgusted at the same time, this movie is for them."
1,omg they made a zombie nation 2,"horrible plothorrible actingeven as a low budget exploit, totally suxonly other zombie worse then this was zombie nation.only thing worth seeing in this whole pile of zombie garbage is mr. krueger and the naked gals."
1,Please!!!,"I saw it once and maybe will not see it again... I have it because I collect zombie movies, but this one I really didn't need, you shouldn't need it either."
4,Unexpectedly Hilarious,"The sight of sweating, adult men crowding against each other while watching women strip on a tiny stage while wiggling grotesquely enhanced knockers can be less than pleasant, but the producers of this movie made it funny. Really funny. And a metaphor for learned preferences (such as one for grotesquely enhanced breasts!). If you are expecting an erotic movie which will really turn you on, you might want to skip this one unless you are a 13 year old boy. If you're ready for a film full of one liners about politics, the human condition, and, yes, zombie strippers, you'll be falling out of your seat laughing. This flick goes well with beer and adult friends of both genders who can tolerate a substantial amount of gore sprinkled amongst occasionally bad acting."
1,WTHeck!!!,all I can say is I started it and had to see how it ended. I cannot believe I wasted almost 2 hours watching this
1,Bad Bad Bad..... Did I say bad?,This movie sucked. I couldn't even watch this movie for the nudity. Maybe if you watch it with the sound off and fast forward through all the nude scenes.
3,Sexy Naked Zombies!!!,"It started out really good, with the military killing zombies, and one being bitten and accidentally goes to the strip club. There are some smokin' hot naked girls stripping and most of them get bitten and turn into 'Zombie Strippers' They like it because it inhances their performance. Soon, they must stop the flesh-eating strippers or everyone will die! I didn't like the idea of the zombie strippers talking, I like the quiet zombies. If you love zombies and naked women, you'll love ZOMBIE STRIPPERS!!!"
1,How did it get such good ratings??,"This movie is horrible!! I can't call this a B movie, it's more like an F movie! Bad acting, bad directing, bad story, unattractive women, it's missing it all!! The only good thing about this movie is Robert Englund, but not even he can save this bomb! Don't think I say this because I don't like B movies because I love B movies. This though isn't worth the time spent, let alone the money spent!"
2,ARE YOU FREAK'IN KIDDING ME !!!,"Lucky for me I only rented this movie, and I'm not sure it was even worth that! Anyone who gave this five or even four stars must be more brainless than the brain dead goofs in this crazy movie! If people actually thought this was good, I'd hate to see what you people think is a bad movie! I do have one thought for you guy's who liked this movie. rent if you didn't see it already, frankenhooker you'll love that one too!"
2,waste of time,This movie is a waste of time. Go see any other zombie movie. Not worth it at all. Low budget and plain bad.
2,Boobs and Blood - Little Else,"Nothing much beyond nudity and nonsense. Bloods and Boobs, little else. A little humor, production quality and special effects were redeeming, but really a waste of time."
3,So bad it's mildly entertaining,"This movie is deliberately bad. It's intended to be over the top silly, and it is. So, if the intent of a movie is to be bad, and it succeeds, is it a bad movie? Ummm...yes.If you want mindless entertainment, look no further. I did enjoy watching it, but all the while I was thinking to myself, ""Why am I watching this?"""
4,loved it,"If you're a dude, you can't go wrong with strippers and zombies.Plus Jenna Jameson is the iceing on the cake."
2,What A Joke!,"A real eye-opener at the lives of people whose idea of success is to become masturbatory material. I thought this might be cool in a ""cult film"" way, but it wasnt."
2,Strange Movie,"Watched this movie with my boyfriend, just for laughs. Movie was pretty bad, but seems like it was intentional. Lots of gore and girls showing their naked chests. Wouldn't necessarily recommend this movie unless you've got nothing better to watch."
1,I can't believe this is consider top 5 most popular,"this is possibly the worst and dumbest movie i've ever seen.the story doesn't make sense, very flawed, the girls are ugly after being turn into zombies, plus it is nothing close to a zombie movie.if your bore and you want to watch soft porn, skip past the first 10 minutes and watch some porn n shut it down. because it does not get any better.i am very disappointed at amazons movie selections."
2,needlessly political = unwatchable,"Looked funny. Looked campy. Figured to be good for a cheap gross-out and a laugh. Wrong.Needlessly political, RIGHT FROM THE SET-UP in the beginning! Politics should have nothing at all to do with a zombie-stripper movie UNLESS everyone you know in Hollywood hates the President (former), thinks him a fool and a war-monger. ... then it's funny I guess.I can see how this was made; how it was funded; and why I never heard of it before I saw a preview with another movie. Funny, the premise isn't mentioned in the preview... I wonder why?"
1,Stop watching half way through,I watched about the first 45 minutes and had to stop. The acting was horrible and horrible plot. It might be a good movie if you were drunk.
1,zombie strippers,"This movie follows most zombie flixs, but the acting is terrible. Robert England does a good job, but he can't carry the whole movie."
3,No reason to go out of your way...,"Although ""Zombie Strippers"" is certainly not the worst of the ""X vs. zombie"" films out there, it could have been much, much better than what it ended up being. I mean, there's a certain gusto you have to go for in films like this....PIRANHA 3D nailed it. You go balls out or you don't even bother. This could have been an AMAZING splatter flick in the hands of the demented geniuses over at TOKYOShock....but instead is just a largely boring, mundane American zombie flick."
2,Don't do it!,I would NOT buy this dvd. It's cut to hell. Try to get the uncut dvd. If not don't buy. PEACE!
1,this is a C movie,"the story is ok. only thing bad is all of the dialog. all of it. and the girls. not hot, but good for stripper quality i guess."
1,Way too much gore.,I would not suggest this flick again. Way to much gore. No plot to it at all.Sorry I made the choice to begin with.
1,Could not watch more than 5 minutes.,"Rented on whim. Wished I hadn't. Expected ""camp"", funny, b-grade SYFY but what I got was just terrible. Nothing good about this piece of crap."
1,There is nothing redeemable about this movie. Nothing.,"An attempt at creating a cult classic, except everything is terrible. And not in the good way. In the terrible way. There is nothing redeemable about this movie. Nothing."
3,"B-rated horror and softcore adult action, nothing more","People can say this movie is terrible, but nobody is watching this movie for Academy Award winning acting. No, people (such as myself) watched this movie just for entertainment and of course to see some pretty women with their clothes off. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is laughable, and the story is far-fetched. But again, this movie was made for entertainment purposes. I am a fan of Jenna Jameson and it was nice to see the world has not forgotten her, and that she still looks good. Plus Robert Englund did a good job with the lousy script he was given.If you want to see some B-rated horror violence and Jenna Jameson with her clothes off (shocker there), then watch the movie. If not, do not keep saying bad things about the flick because you obviously missed the point that the movie was supposed to be cheesy fun."
2,DON'T BE FOOLED!!!,"I didn't buy this movie expecting an Oscar-nominee, but I did at least expect something campy & fun. Unfortunately, it was neither. Very boring and repetitive script with some of the worse acting I have ever seen. The only saving grace was a few decent makeup effects here and there. If you're looking for something campy & fun along the same lines, try PLANET TERROR...much better!"
3,UM....WIERD,"Now this definately was a wierd movie, the only thing good was the strippers, other than that, it sucked."
3,Weird,This camera is really insane..These are five years old. The play MP3s for no reason.The camera has errors and you must have a steady hand or else you get fuzzy pictures.SHAKE THE CAMERA WHILE TAKING PICS.great results if you are interested in artsy type photos.Good luck. Buy it
1,Maybe the beginning of a legendary junk camera,"If you like the quirky pictures which a Holga, Diana, or other cameras produce; you will like this. I was originally angry at the poor quality of images as I wanted to use the camera for professional insurance work. But....I let it set in a drawer for six months and got it back out.I experimented with it and got some interesting surreal results which I made into works of art with PhotoShop. This toy camera may be the beginning of another legendary junk camera."
5,A Necessary Good,"This book was recommended by someone who already completed their theology studies. They indicated that this is the best synopsis available, and I'd have to agree. While it may not have the original Greek text, the price is right, and it's a great resource to have for study."
4,must have for bible teachers,"Well bound, sturdy, durable. This places the four canonical Gospels in parallel columns, arranged to correspond to each other when there is repetition. It is in English. Unfortunately it is in the RSV (ESV or even NIV would be preferable). A 'must-have' for any pastor's or Bible teachers' library."
3,"It's OK, But Not Everything I Would Have Liked To Have","I bought the Model DM100 Silver as a second option to my Seiko 100-88 (which I really like and still use). The DM100 is smaller and has fewer metronome features (fewer beat sound options, one instead of two independent metronomes, and a slightly less flexible set of rhythms), but is less expensive. Besides, the 100-88 is no longer available.The DM100 has a slot in the case for attaching to a music stand and a push-button power switch--very handy. The beat sound is not quite wood-block; it's a little bit electronic sounding and perhaps more tolerable to non-players in your presence when you are using it while practicing. My biggest disappointment is that the adjustable volume doesn't go loud enough for some playing situations, probably because it is powered by two AAA batteries, instead of a 9V battery. All-in-all I am satisfied with it, but it is a step down from the Seiko 100-88."
5,Folkmanis Goat Puppet Review,"My son received this a few days ago and has already had such amazing adventures with it! THE SALE PRICE IS AMAZING! He's 2 1/2, sometimes his Dad or myself are the puppeteers and sometimes he is! This little guy is SO SOFT and well made. Very snuggly! It was so easy to clean, not that it had to be, but I did hand wash it with some of my sons Dreft detergent. Dried fast and smells fantastic. This is a must have for your kids puppet collection. We just love the quality and size of Folkmanis puppets. We haven't been disappointed yet and we own 5! We are so in-love with this brand."
5,Borges,"This editions of Spanish Reader are excellent for my Spanish 4 classes and for my AP Spanish. Borges is presented in an accessible manner for the intermediate student and also challenging enough for AP students.I am quite happy with these Spanish Reader series. I bought already the Ana Maria Matute, Miguel de Unamuno, Federico Garcia Lorca and of course the Jorge Luis Borges volume."
3,"Fun, but could be better","I got this game for Christmas, as well as Loaded Questions. The two games are almost exactly alike, except that Loaded Questions is a board game. I was very disappointed to find out that these games are so much alike. Some of the questions make this game really fun, but some are a bit cheesy. It is a pretty good game, but if you buy this, don't buy Loaded Questions also."
4,the best review ever,I love that my son is having so(...) much fun.And i think he wil buy a another one
1,it is piece of bs,This toy i just got and it took on my driger g also engine gear and my driger destroyed it it fell apart like a freaking piece of crap.Someone would have to pay me to bye antoher one it completely is worthless.I woulda said no stars but i cant
4,Ok book to understand sexual addiction,I bought this book to help me understand sexual addiction. It works well for this particular form of the disease.
5,Absolultey on the mark,"I have only just recently begun to read this book. But already I am absolutely shocked by how on target everything it says is. As I read the pages, I find myself wondering if the author has not been observing me and taking notes. I have always held a strong fear of sexuality, and always feel guilty when I find myself watching pretty girls or getting aroused. The author's descriptions if an interior world of denial and self doubt are precisely on the mark. I have not begun to utilize any therapeutic tips offered within, but so far I am deeply impressed."
5,Necessary for couples who are unable to share intimacy,"This is a textbook about sexual anorexia, which is a condition that causes a person to fear intimacy to the point of incredible pain. It contains a plan for recovery, and certainly is a place to begin to grapple with such a sensitive and important part of life."
2,"Nice puzzle, for people who don't have anything better to do","What a joke. Unmarked parts, terrible instructions. Not done yet, but this review can only go lower. Would it have killed you to have spent an hour and 25 cents to provide adequate instructions and label the parts?Steel is flimsy too."
5,Excellent light-duty bench,"Since I don't tear down car engines, I needed only a light duty bench and wanted one like this for storage as well as workspace. There is a similarly configured model at Harbor Freight and on Ebay for about $120, and I was thinking about going that route. But I had a chance to look at that bench in person at my local Harbor Freight. For a little more money, this Gorilla Rack bench is light years ahead of that other bench in terms of engineering, quality of materials, fit and finish, and stability. It's also a foot longer which equals more workspace and storage. The only thing I would add would be a center support for the bottom shelf. But the screw holes are there, and it's therefore no problem to cut a piece of wood and screw it in place. This bench makes the cheaper one look like junk. I paid a little more and got a lot more."
3,Mediocre - Thy name is Gorilla Rack,"While I agree with other posters on here that ""you get what you pay for"", I did expect that I would at least get the hardware to fasten the work surface to the bench. Somewhere between that and the flimsy feel to the drawers (because they too need a little extra fastening) I am left feeling rather disappointed in this bench. The metal goes together pretty easily and the instructions are adequate. The wood however just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Like other reviewers, my particleboard and pegboard were damaged in shipping. I know it's a workbench, but really...why bother including the crappy wood, in lackluster packaging which will just have to be replaced upon opening? Why not pre-drill and include the hardware to hold the last bits together. All in all I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, and I won't recommend it here."
5,this rocks!,"great rock! i remember seeing paul collin's beat singing ""on the highway"" on mtv when they showed videos. was quite happy to find this cd. get it."
4,You should love rock and roll like this guy loves rock and roll,"Had the Nerves called themselves Collins, Case and Lee they might have had a chance during the ""me"" decade. Instead they chose a name that was punk (at that time)and played pop. All three went on to put out some amazing music with other groups and solo. The Beat predates The Plimsouls by just a hair. Both groups are amazing. ""Rock and Roll Girl"" and ""Don't Fit In"" are pretty close to perfect. Like other power pop 90% of the songs are about a girl (longing for, Loving, and breaking up). Whether you pay $10 bucks or $20 bucks for this double cd you aren't going to lose."
3,Ok not what I expected,"It was ok, but maybe on DVD is better as you can see his face expression which will probably make it funnier. I was disappointed as he is my favorite comedian."
3,"Good, but...","...two things come to mind when I think about this cd. Funny, but repetitive. I just started getting into George Lopez, and I think he is incredibaly funny and talented. I'm not Mexican, but I could still relate to some of the situations that he talked about. No offense to anyone, but his white pple impressions are really funny. I also liked the 7up bit and the uncle bit,(although i've heard it before.) I watched this show Live (on t.v.) and enjoyed it, but felt that some parts were a little repetitive-they came straight from his last album Right Now Right Now (which was really funny, by the way.) Also, I felt that he was holding back a little. Now I also watch his show George Lopez on ABC, and I know that he is much much more talented than what he portrayed onstage. I know I'll watch and enjoy his next act, but I hope he gives us a little more than he has been recently."
3,Classic Material,"As a fan of George Lopez I've heard or seen nearly all of his material in the last 5 years. The material was good, but I've heard about 2/3rds of it before. I liked the material the first time and was disappointed it was released as an album. I still look foward to this next one though"
5,Hilarious,This cd is absolutely hilarious. We listen to it at work all the time. George hits the latinos right on the spot with this cd.
4,ya its coo,"Ya i like this CD. This isn't his best work though i expected a lot more from george lopez. But it still makes me laugh but not out loud, it just kind of makes me smile and laugh inside, If you really wanna get some latin comedy buy "" the latin kings of comedy"" on dvd"
4,GREAT COMEDY HOUR.,"This is a great comedy CD. Sabes que I BARELY GOT IT. I heard it was very funny, but it didn't interest me that much. I finally bought it and thought it was very funny. It is a must have from George Lopez's fans. I can relate to many of the things he mentions, which makes everything even more hilarious. Recomended."
5,Well worth the wait!,"As a George Lopez fan for many years, long before his fantastic television series that has introduced him to millions of new fans, I waited anxiously for ""Team Leader"". His last album, ""Right Now, Right Now"" was simply suberb and this follows right in its class. George's comedy cuts across color and cultural lines to lampoon the goofy things that we all share. He laughs at himself and helps us do the same. I laughed myself to the point of tears while listening to this. I highly, highly recommend it!"
5,Great action movie,great actors and great plot. Read the subtitles in English. Two disc one for blueray and the other a regular dvd.
1,Its sucks,"There only three actions scenes in this 2 hour movie. its an hour, and 55 minutes of men crying. don't waste your money"
4,an unexpected action drama,"Looking at the title when I rented this, i expected mostly action thriller with gun blazing similar to other Hong Kong movies. It turned out the story encorporated within it made me feel for the character and their lives much more. The action was great but with a story that written well, I'd enjoyed it a lot more."
1,Defective! Do Not Waste Your Money,"Piece of CRAP! Unit shorted out 20 seconds after start up. Sub standard, PISS POOR engineered products like this should be permanently removed from sale on this, or any other, store front."
4,Great Burner for the price,"Installation couldn't be easier-just unplug the old one and plug the new one in. Win98 recognized it immediately, and the burning software (NERO) was very intuitive. Recommended."
2,Pretty but that's it,These are pretty little shoes but not very comfy and it just didn't fit right for my small foot. I gave them away.
1,Bubble levels are not accurate,The bubble levels are not aligned with the laser line. In fact they are way off. At least an inch over 10 feet. If you cant rely on a level it is worthless.
5,Love it!,My husband had this book when he was six and now our three year old loves it! I couldn't believe amazon had this. My husband was so excited when it arrived. My son flips through it all the time and spends hours with it. Thanks again!
2,HOW TO BUILD A DOOR?,"As a builder and craftsman, this book doesn't really help. It covers some history and tools in the construction of doors but doesn't help with the construction techniques or tools you might need to build a better modern door. I wouldn't have bought this book if I had been able to look at first."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"If you want to learn how to build doors, as the title suggests, do not buy this book. You will be sorely disappointed, and guaranteed that this book will not aid you in building a door. If on the other hand, you are simply looking for some black and white sketches of various types of doors, then this could be the book for you.A complete waste of money.Jeff"
1,Terrific source for building doors.,"I have been looking for a source for quite some time for directions for building ""board and batten"" doors and was glad to finally find this book. Not only did I find the particular door I was looking for but there were lots of illustrations for many different types of doors many of which are historical reproductions.I highly recommend this book.Stephanie Lish"
3,A Great Idea Book..... and that's all.,"If you are a woodworking book collector, like I, buy this book. It has some great ideas with historical data that is very interesting. I've had it for a month or so and it has yet to be shelved. I've used it for a few designs already and will do so for a long time. It's the little things you gain in its detail that are of value. It's well produced drawings show off the internal components of historically crafted doors. I'd buy this book again but if you are seeking a guide to building doors, pass this book by. It is strictly an idea/data guide. Find it cheap, buy it."
4,Good but Not GREAT!!,"Purchased this player because I love Audio Books....and I've found that this one only needs one thing to make it GREAT!! It needs to have a separate ""pause"" button/OR a Turn OFF button that will let you stop and start at the same place in the disc instead of having to completely start the disc over.Other than this very irritating problem, it is great!!"
2,Not much meat,This book gives an overview of ebay's creation and why it has been a success. It gives no insider insights however. It was fun to read but I did not learn much from it. This book does not have substance.
3,Sold!!,"This book basically delivers what it promises to. Lots of somewhat dry facts about how a small Internet business boomed into one of the hottest ""sites"" available.I am a big Ebay fan. I wanted to find out more about the people who created Ebay but also wanted to get a feel for the direction these people were hoping to guide the future of the site to.Although I thought the story was fairly interesting, this book was very dryly written. Not much was cited other than the absolute bare bones facts and the writing was not particularly interesting.While I realize this is a business book, I think there was much room for interesting tidbits, advice or funny stories. None here. Too bad..."
1,A poor read,"This book is basically a series of quoted and sited magazine articles hastily cobbled together into a book. The only ""real"" interviews done by the author are with a few eBay customers who use the site. The author admits no one with eBay granted him an interview or let him in the building. For a much better story of how eBay came to be, read eBoys by Robert Stross."
2,why not learn good design by looking at good design?,"Is Vincent Flanders actually Jakob Nielsen in comedy mood? Both seem to think that picking holes in other people's work makes them bigger men, as if stamping on the heads of pygmies were as worthwhile as standing on the shoulders of giants.Public humiliation of the underdog is the hallmark of the bully.At least Flanders doesn't only slate, but also offers constructive criticism.But I doubt that Paul Simon writes brilliant music by only ever listening to N-Sync and Britney Spears; I suspect that he listens and learns from other brilliant musicians.The the best way to learn good design is to look at good design."
3,3 short stories,"Death Times Three is not a complete novel, but rather a collection of 3 short stories, 'Bitter End', 'Frame-up For Murder' and 'Assault on a Brownstone'.The best is 'Bitter End' where Nero Wolfe is determined to find the culprit who has been tampering with his favorite brand of pate. If he solves a murder in the meantime that's just a bonus.Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories are an interesting mix of American and British mystery writing. Nero Wolf is an eccentric loner in the British tradition of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot. The stories are narrated by Wolfe's sidekick Archie Goodwin, similar to Poirot's Captain Hastings. However the character and narrative manner of Goodwin is more in the line of the American tradition of Phillip Marlowe, and the Continental-Op."
1,Beware Don't buy this for Streetpilot C series,"Amazon shows this as an accessory for the Garmin C340. I bought the C340 and this dash mount relying on Amazon's representations. The mount does not fit the C series gps. I tried to communicate the problem to Amazon and the third time they acknowledged indicating the proper department would be notified so the misleading representation could be reviewed. The return was a problem and I had to complain to get the amount of purchase credited. I'm out $8.00 return shipping plus the runaround, and it's Amazon's fault I got the wrong mount. Guess what? The page is still incorrect. Don't buy this dash mount for the C series, it takes a special mount and you will pay for Amazon's mistake."
4,Rocks for normal drivers,"I drive a company-supplied vehicle, so alterations to the dash are out-of-the question. As long as the cord is not interfering with gravity (run under the bean bag) this will hold up for all but the most extreme driving.I don't drive like an old lady, but I don't really take into consideration G-forces when I am on the road. Unless you drive like an &^%hole this will probably stay put pretty well. For the record, I drive a 2004 Ford Freestar (a real babe magnet, let me tell you.) and live in a pretty hilly twisty suburb of Philadelphia. The only time this thing fell off the dash was when I ran the wire to the power adapter underneath the bean bag."
2,"Don't buy this product, if u want to move your GPS from cars to cars","If u want to use your GPS on different cars, u should buy Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi and StreetPilot C Series (010-10908-00) instead. Garmin doesn't show this information on their website, Garmin just tries to confuse the users, so that users would end up buying both Garmin Automotive Mount for Nuvi (010-10723-04) & Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units (010-10306-00), while 010-10908-00 alone could serve the same purpose."
1,Garmin Beanbag for Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units,"I ordered the Garmin Beanbag assuming my Garmin NUVI 360 would attach to it. When I received the Beanbag I determined the GPS had no way of attaching the GPS unit. If YOUR COMPANY is going to sell the beanbag you should make everyone aware a ""special"" device is required. I had to contact Garmin with my problem and they had to research to find which ""mount"" was required and then they made me give my VISA card number so the could charge me .95 cents for the mount. It took another week to obtain the mount because it was shipped through UPS. All that could have been avoided had you told me initially that I needed a special mount in order to use the beanbag. I wouldn't be apprehensive in the future purchasing from you had you been more alert to my needs with the beanbag and sold me all necessary equipment first time around."
1,Nice but it doesn't work,"This product replaces the window mount for using a GPS in a car. I needed this because the window mount kept falling off. The description said that it would work with my GPS. (IQueM5) When it arrived, it was clear that additional parts were needed to make it usable for my GPS and probably for all others. I contacted the company that sold me the Mount and was told I would have to get the other parts from Garmin. The Garmin website said that the Mount was only part of what I would need and I should contact the Garmin dealer to get the other parts. I returned the Mount and got a refund.The design of the mount seems good but don't buy it unless you have the other parts you need to connect your GPS to it."
3,Works great but bulky.,"This mount works great and is a lifesaver if you don't want a permanent mount but live in a state where windshield mounts are illegal. If you travel a lot, it is bulky and heavy however. A suction mount is a better alternative for heavy travelers."
2,Garmin Fricton Mount,The Friction Mount for My Garmin Gps unit 010-10306-00Will not work with the Mount that came with the Garmin 350
1,be careful before you buy this,"This version does not come with the mounting arm. You have to buy the version that costs three dollars more to get the mounting arm. The other complaint I have is that I originally bought the C330 and the tri-pod friction mount. The C330 crapped out and, as a discontinued item, they replaced it with a Nuvi 260. The tri-pod friction mount has the capacity to slide in a new arm, but Garmin doesn't make or sell one. I may try to self fabricate one out of protest that they stranded my investment in what is now a useless friction mount.Do they even sell the arms for these things separately?"
1,I am so confused about the friction mounts,"I bought a GPS Street Pilot C340 and a garmin beanbag mount with a handle which does not fit. Now I have to return it but the problem is I want a friction beanbag mount for the dash but all this confusion about buying another parft??? can someone please help and advise the correct mount to buy for my unit. Do I need the beanbag with or without the handle or no handle and buy another part. This is very misleading. I bought mine from Bestbuy and the guy told me it was for all GPS units but clearly it is not as there is no hole in the back of my GPS for it to push through the handle on the beanbag?? So far, much to my surprise the suction mount works perfectly but its a pain having to take it on and off every time you leave the vehicle and in the dark it doersnt clip on very easily. Love the GPS, so far the beanbag is the problem??"
1,Buyer Beware,"This mount doesn't work with the ""C"" series of GPS units. There is provision for changing the mount, but it seems a lot easier to buy the 010-10908-00 the first time."
2,equipment was defective,The mount was missing a piece which holds the gps to the mount. We will be returning this for creditThank YouDarlene Shallcross
5,Garmin Beanbag better than window suction cup,"I formerly placed my Garmin Nuvi on my front window below my rear-view mirror. The suction cup would eventually break loose and my Garmin would fall to the floor.This beanbag is perfect for stability and ease-of-placement on my Prius' dashboard. My Nuvi is as solidly planted as if it were permanently placed there. Sudden stops or turns doesn't displace this beanbag.For a fantastic alternative to the suction cup, this beanbag is perfect.Make sure that you have the Garmin Automotive Mount for Nuvi (010-10723-04)."
2,Darn it!,"Well I bought this to go with my NUVI 260, I was assured it would do the job.I'm sure it would if I could attach the thing to my GPS.I was sold it and it doesn't have the correct fit.I guess I should have researched a bit more and not taken the sellers word."
2,Garmin friction mount for NUVI 660,"I suspect that this mount will work fine, once I get all the ""additional parts"" that I need for it. I bought a NUVI 660 here and wanted the dash friction mount for it. The Amazon advert said ""this is alll you will need"" however it isn't there is another mount part [Garmin Automotive Mount for Nuvi 660 (010-10823-02)] that is required. It's not that I have to pay for an additional part, it's just that I had to go through the entire process of ordering and such to get the other pieces I need. Seems sort of like buying a car and afterwards they tell you ""oh, you wanted tires with that?"""
1,The wrong Part,"This product,The Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units (010-10306-00, is only suited for some of the small GPS systems. It is lacking a part for any of the c5XX series and cannot be used. Until such time as Amazon carries the other friction base (It comes with the curved arm and ball used to hold the GPS unit) the correct part can be ordered directly from Garmin. It you intend to use this in more than one car the friction mount gives you an easy way to move the GPS system."
3,does not work for garmin streetpilot i5,"This friction mount does not work for garmin streetpilot i5 even though the description says it works for streetpilot model in general. I am giving it a 3 star because the product seems to be well built, but no field test though. I returned this and bought the other model of the friction mount."
3,Need another part,"I bought this for our Nuvi 350 after reading reviews on this site. However, when I received it I realized I needed another part (correct arm for mount) to make it fit. I believe this is a great mount but be sure and buy the exact version for the GPS you have. After a lot of searching, have located the part number and have ordered the solution, but way more trouble than necessary."
4,Great product,The friction mount allows me easy use when traveling in another person's car. I play tennis at many different locations and we take turns driving. All I have to do is set it on the dash and attach my 350 nuvi.
1,compatibility,This product was not compatible with my Garmin 350. They need to specify exactly which models can be used with this mount.
3,Slides!!!,"This mount is very convenient and easy to use, but it slides quite a bit.It can be distracting and dangerous as once the whole unit fell in my lap while driving."
1,Garmin Friction Mounting,"Garmin North America Auto Navigation Kit for Garmin Vista C and Legend C (010-10564-00)I returned my friction mount because I did not recieve all the necessary parts to use it. There was no adaptor to attach the phone to the mount, only the bean bag part arrived.I am certain that I did not recieve what I needed because a friend of mine has the same item. It was easier to return it than go through the hassle of trying to order the correct part...which is disappointing"
1,incomplete product,"I was very disappointed that I needed another piece to attach my GPS unit to this device. This piece did not come with the unit nor could I purchase the it from the company. Thus, this product was useless to me and needed to be sent back."
3,garmin beanbag,Beanbag is okay but it is a little light for the 7200. It would probably be great for the smaller GPS.
3,nice bean bag but no adapter,I thought it would be easy to find a goose neck adapter for this beanbag.My garmin nuvi 770 did not come with the adapter just the suction cup window mount. I found a tape down mount that comes with the goose neck I needed for about $20 so I now have the bean bag with the goose neck adapter and an extra tape down mount I don't realy need. The ad for the bean bag says the adapter comes with the Nuvi but It doesn't always.The suction cup mount won't work with the bean bag.
1,This beanbag mount is not complete,"Based on the product description and photos, I thought this beanbag would work with the suction cup mount that came with my Garmin GPS. It does not. The suction cup mount base is too thick and too big around. You need to buy the beanbag with the mount, unless you already have a beanbag mount and only need the beanbag."
2,Doesn't fit StreetPilot C530,The base of the c530 mount is 2.5 inches. The docking station of this beanbag is less than 2 inches. Doesn't fit. Now I notice that the description has changed...no longer mentions my garmin model.
1,Useless! Just the bean bag nothing to connect the GPS unit,Be very careful - this is just the bean bag (for those people who break into your car to steal the bean bag (leaving the mount and GPS unit behind?!?!)If you buy this Amazon will make you pay for shipping it back.Make sure you buy the unit with the mount included!!!!
3,"A different model is the one for a Nuvi, not this model","This is NOT the friction mount needed for a Nuvi.You want #10908, which doesn't require buying an extra part. They are about the same price.When it says ""for Garmin GPS units"" that is misleading. Buy the one that says ""for Nuvi & SP.""Maybe this one works for OTHER Garmin GPS units, but you don't want it for Nuvi."
1,Caution - no mounting arm!,"Be careful which item you order. This model does not include the mounting arm, and you cannot buy it separately. There's another model (10-10908-00) that includes the mounting arm.Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi, StreetPilot I Series & C530, C550 (010-10908-00)Hopefully this will save you the trouble of returning your order like me!"
1,Friction Mount,"This was the wrong item, it didn't have the mounting to attach the Navigational system."
2,I have the extra piece and it still doesn't work,"I have the arm mount (that goes on the window) that comes originally with the device. I guess the arm mount that fits into this bean bag, is a different size arm because the one I have does not fit or slide into place. It is really bad of the company to give a window mount that does not work but spend an extra thirty and Maybe the dash mount will work.... What you really need with this product is faith because you can not return the open package."
2,MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT,"Be sure you want only the beanbag without the mount-- Unless you've lost only the bag, this is not much use without the appropriate mount."
5,Awesome!,"Bought this for the Garmin 7200 (7-inch screen). The Garmin 7200 comes with the back support that slides into this beanbag and locks. I wondered if this item would be able to properly support the large size and weight of the 7200, but it works like a charm. Placed it on the dash of a Ford Explorer and had no problems driving from Delaware to Indiana and even through the curvy mountain roads of West Virginia."
2,Garmin Beanbag,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UK9X/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe vendor was ok, just was missing the clip that I needed to install it onto the beanbag. I made the mistake just ordering one piece ""assuming"" it came together."
2,"Mount not included,didn't know I couldn't find one separately.",I know that the add said mount not included.I just didn't know it would be almost impossible to find a mount for my 650 as of yet.So the bean bag sits here unused..Richard Garza
5,I'd buy another,I already have one and liked it so much I bought one for my husbands Garmin GPS also.
2,Before Ordering Understand what You Are Ordering,Made a mistake in ordering a REPLACEMENT beanbag portable friction mount for my Garmin GPS order went throught with no problems 17th St Photo shipped the item no problem However there was a minor problem a replacement beanag is just that beanbag only No Mount. I wanted the whole unit. So I returned the item and reordered the correct item. My mistake unit costed me an extra 20.00 postage and extra cost of the unit.!7th Street Photo treated me very fair and quickly.Other than that it works fine
1,NOT FOR USE WITH 550C STREET PILOT,"THIS IS A GOOD MOUNT, BUT IT DOES NOT ADAPT TO THE STREET PILOT. i SENT THE FIRST ONE BACK AND THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK, BUT IT DID NOT. I AM STILL WAITING ON A CREDIT. MY SON HAS THIS FOR HIS MARINE UNIT AND IT WORKS GREAT"
1,This mount doesn't work! Amazon do something!,I bought the mount for my c340 streepilot and it didn't work. Amazon please do something.
2,Do not buy - Incomplete,This item does not come with the mounting neck to attach your unit to the base. Order Portable friction mount (no installation required) Part Number: 010-10908-00. This comes with the neck.
1,Replacement Part Only - DO NOT BUY,"This is a replacement part only - it is not the complete friction mount as advertised. I bought this after its being offered as ""better together"" with a Nuvi 370 purchased at the same time. The correct part number is 010-10908-00 and it costs less than $1 more. Save yourself the double shipping time and order the correct part the first time!"
5,Mobility Enhancement,"I purchased a Nuvi for our delivery trucks. The included suction cup soon became useless after a few months from constant changing of vehicles. Thanks to a purchase suggestion from Amazon, I discovered the friction mount. It is perfect, if the Nuvi must be used frequently in several vehicles, or simply removed from a vehicle often to prevent theft."
1,Poor!,"The product was sent with missing mount, so I can't use this...great job in making a $30.00 paper weight!!!!"
1,Mount will not work - Amazon is recommending an incomplete product,Amazon recommended this mount for the Garmin 680 but it lacks a part to mount the GPS. I found out from Garmin that the mount is only a REPLACEMENT part and you cannot buy the other piece to mount the GPS. Amazon is recommending and selling a mount that does not work due to a missing part which you cannot buy separately. Found out from other reviews that they told Amazon and no results. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
2,It's incomplete,"The problem with this portable deal is that it does not inlcude the attachment piece that goes onto the c330 unit (or any other unit) that is then used to attach to the mount. So, if you don't already know that there is ""something else"" that needs to be purchased, it is useless. I ended up returning this one."
1,not compatable,This product is not compatible with the larger Garmin GPS and was not described correctly.
1,Garmin Bean Bag,"The bean bag does not work without the mount that should be packaged with it. We have a Nuvi 205 the mount that came with this Garmin does not fit onto the bean bag. Be sure you purchase this item with the mount included, it is worth the few extra dollars."
1,Slides after 6 months,"The ""friction"" foam slides after only 6 months. I don't use anything to clean the dash but windex. Poor design."
3,Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00,"I bought this friction mount for my NUVI 360 so I could move it between my cars and my work truck. I also have a problem with the windshield mount. In the Summer when the windshield gets hot it falls off.The friction mount works good in my wife's car and in my van. However, in my work truck (which havs a GVW of 24000 lbs) when I place it on the slanted dashboard it tends to slide when I hit bumps on the road. I had to construct a wire holder to hold it inplace so I don't have to keep retreiving it from the front of the dash after it slides. I think it is a little to light to hold my NUVI. But in my regular vehicles it does work quite well."
4,Friction Mount,"Mount works very well. Will slide with sharp turns or ""brake check"" stops, but overall, it sure beats the windshield mount that (after a while) tends to fall off at the least opportune times."
3,Looks well made,I ordered this holder but it didn't fit my Garmin. It was well made andand I suspect that it would have a long life. I returned itusing Amazon's return policy.
1,Very Upset Customer,"The product I was shipped is the wrong model and therefore incompatable with my GPS Unit.It took me several days to get through on the phone, only to be told to go to the web site for instructions on how to return the product.I did that, entered the information, and have been waiting for about a week for a reply/authorization.Can you help????"
2,Be Warned,"I got my brand new nuvi 670 and a matching sandbag by Garmin. Within the first mile I drove, they just flew off the dashboard when I started at a traffic light. I guess I should have accelerated REALYYYY slow."
1,"Careful, not for StreetPilot C550","Perhaps I'm just mixed up but I read the description to say it fits the StreetPilot so I bought it. But it doesn't. Either that or I'm a total dufus and can't figure it out.If I return it, I pay a 15% restocking fee. That's kind of a bummer. So what we did was modify our c550 suction mount to fit the portable mount. It's not perfect but it works. The suction of the c550 is a joke, even when using with the little stick on disk. It releases itself after a jolt or two. That's why I was so excited to see this portable thingamagig.Now, this thing can move around a bit also. So we put one small velcro circle on our dash (it's black like the dash) and the other side on the bottom of the portable thing. Keeps it from moving."
2,Not age appropriate.,"Even the ""easier"" cards were too difficult for my 4 year old. He became frustrated easily."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this game in hopes that it would help my Kindergartener learn his alphabet. When I opened the box I found the mat, which is the board game to have the alphabet in large cursive-like twirly writing. For example you can't tell the ""i"" for the ""l"". It's confusing for him and was a total waste of money."
4,A Nice Solid Phone,"This phone has a look and feel of quality, and it is one of few wall phones available with the keys on the body of the phone rather than on the handheld part. The only negative aspect of this phone is its ""single gong ringer,"" which is not very loud at full volume. Cortelco does offer another model with a double gong ringer though, which I assume would be louder."
1,POOR SOUND,"I bought the better of the two models (the one made in USA). I would have never guessed in this day and age a corded phone could sound so bad. So (unfortunately)I disposed of the box before really having a full conversation using this phone, and haven't asked about returning it. No knock on the seller - but rather the manufacturer.Incoming voices are muffled and unclear and the folks getting my calls can't understand me. Everyone of my wireless phones in the house is better than this phone. (Even our cell phones are clearer- and we live in a poor cell phone reception area)I'll replace it with a suitable cheap wall phone as soon as I can find a black one. THIS TIME I""LL SAVE THE BOX!"
4,Extremely good from start to finish,"This is the only adult CD written and sung by Ms. Fredericks who went on to write childrens' CDs. It is pop oriented and every track has engaging melodies and entertaining arrangements. The ""Reasons To Love"" track in particular is extraordinary. While probably not going to make anyone's must-have, desert island CD list, it does not deserve the oblivion it apparently has been consigned to. My rating of 4 means I like the album, still listen to it and recommend a purchase."
4,boat light,"The light works great and is perfect for what we need, however the clamp that secures it to the boat is flimsy so the light does not seem stable."
1,Rub-on tattoos,"Description was somewhat skimpy and if the price is too good to be true then it is. I expected sketches, not rub-on tatoos."
3,Somebody stole his picture...,"A Classic story with a modern twist:The Picture of Dorian Gray (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (Barnes & Noble Classics)is the story of a man who never grows old, but his picture does.In modern times( starting in New York) he has been sixty years the behind the scenes king.There are flashbacks to WW II and New York with a Chinese crime lord.A old time professional burglar comes out of retirement to do the 'David' Gray house.What he doesn't realize is that Gray is desperate to get his painting back,and willing to do what it takes to get it back: kidnapping andtorture included.The movie seems to be a very clever blending of old and newwithout seems to do major harm to either?Tattoos and the occult enter into it...and a wicked twist."
1,doesn't fit,I bought this and the etrex legend but the legend does not fit into this model. It looks like a fine product but not for this shape etrex.
3,works ok,"had for a couple years now.It has not broken. The only complaint I have is that it vibrates too much, but I would probably still buy it."
3,Dash Mount,"It's a great holder for my GPS.However, the temporary stick mount doesn't hold up well after a couple of uses.I don't always get the same van at work so I have to change the mount around."
3,it messed the peice to connect with etrex 20,"It messed the piece to connect with etrex 20. May Garmin send it to me as in the catalog included note ( if your etrex is not a C or CX version with color display screen, a separate battery cover with the Auxiliary mount adapter attached is provided for connection to the mounting cradle).Why they did not deliver it although I ordered the dash mount in the same order with the etrex 20. If yes contact me to take address."
4,etrex vista automotive mount (010-10274-00),Mount works good. I have it in my truck using the temporary mounting adhesive. It holds real well and I haven't tried taking it off of my dash. Will be interesting to see how the adhesive holds up in the winter when the temperatures dip down below 0 deg. F.
3,Not for Legend Cx,This unit will not fit the Legend Cx. The Legend Cx has the removable memory. The mounting bracket requires you to replace the battery cover in order to snap into the bracket. There is a notch on the back of the battery cover but this not does not exist on the automotive mounting bracket.
2,Doesn't stay stuck,"The design of the bracket is very nice, but the adhesuve doesn't stay stuck to the dash.It works for a while, but after a few hours in the sun, the adhesive becomes soft and gooey. Take a quick turn, and the GPS flies off into your lap.I'll have to try the windshield (suction cup) mount."
5,Been great so far!,"I bought this mount to use on my atv for hunting season.It fit perfectly on my gas tank and kept my gps close to me, also in this position, The handle bars keep it protected from tree limbs and mud.The gps can be quickly removed from the mount with the push of a little tab behind the unit,or you can remove the whole assembly leaving only the round base piece in place. I know this is not the ""intended"" use for this style mount,but so far it's held up great for me."
1,This book will screw you up,"Stay away from it at all costs. It's more of a big advertisement for Platz than a source of serious information. His ""Tom Platz extended-sets training strategy"" can be summed up as ""do whatever you think works best."" Oh boy, that's really helpful. Typical worthless training book from a pro who's just looking for something to hock. If you want to look at pictures of Platz, this book is okay. For real training information, it's worse than useless."
5,This Man Knows a Lot,"Very well written by someone who knows what they're talking about. I don't like to read about music unless it's going to give me some insight into the reason the music exists, why it's being played the way it is, or what influenced someone to push themselves to become a virtuoso. Music can transcend the mundane and allow you to communicate with the spirit; even if it's only momentary. At times, Nat Hentoff does that same thing in his book. He's a well known author on jazz and this book shows you why."
3,good guide but few practice songs,Good guide (text) but there are few sheet music items (especially full songs) for practice. Best if acquired with a regular songbook full of sheet music for practicing techniques.
5,"evey body need love, first motown album +feeling bluesy, two classics from Motown","two great classics Apart from the GreatSingles+Flips Many Cuts featuring Electic Harpsichord, Is Motown where the Fab 4 got the idea for lucy in the sky, Good Sound Quality, Smokeys , My Bed of Thorns, is so good. The Second Album on The Disc is also very good , A Great Pairing of two Classics. A Must If You Like The Group or Motown"
2,Unnatural skin tones with Canon printer,"I tried HP Photo Paper on my Canon Pixma printer and did not like the colors in the prints, in particular skin tones. I have tried several printer profiles for HP paper and still could not get the results that would be as good as Canon paper on Canon printer."
2,Tabs on Photos,Just wanted to let people know that the pictures come with removable tabs on the photo paper. Makes the pictures look cheap!
3,Becareful!! it has a tab...,I misunderstanded that it is 4X6 photopaper but it has a 'tab' and hard to cut off this tab. I cut all the tabs with knife. Becarefull!!
5,Gorgeous film and performance,"The filming of this amazing band at Seattle's historic Triple Door is beautiful. The band rocks and Vicci's original songs always keep me singing and dancing and the extras, including the behind-the-scenes, are a great insight into the band and Vicci's songs.Congratulations VMB!"
4,Good overall work out,"This is a great 30 minute, all over work out that especially works the lower body. There's no step and not much aerobic but a lot of squats, lunges and balance work. A little too much balance work for me but you will be sweating by the end."
2,Sorry: not good!,"I know I might get flamed for this (I've been in the past), but here I go. I've heard four Cusco albums in the course of this weekend, and this one is BY FAR the worst. With only three songs (""Serengeti,"" ""Africa-Afrika"" and ""Flying Condor"") worth listening, the majority of the album is super-basic: it lacks feeling for the most part. If you're looking for uplifting New Age music, you will not find it here. Look into Vangelis, Kitaro, Jean-Michel Jarre, Secret Garden or so many other decent acts that truly get to your soul. Not this, PLEASE! (the two stars are for the three songs mentioned above: the rest of the album is worthless)."
3,Too much oil,This product was a big dissapointment. My main issue is it's too oily for me. The second issue I found was it didn't keep my skin moist for long at all. I get really dry skin in the winter and I'm going to switch to something else for now.
4,okay read,"This book was okay, although at times it was just a little unbelievable. At times, I wanted to yell at some of the characters because of their stupid actions."
4,Good starter camera.,"This is a neat and easy to install webcam. The picture quality is not brilliant, but it is about what I expected. The base is not a great design, I have it mounted on top of the monitor, but I don't think it is very secure. The base should mould onto the monitor surface better.I got it for sending photos of the kids to my family. For that it is cheap and easy, and the kids love playing with it, and seeing their photos on screen.At that price it is hard to go wrong! But for real quality photos I know I will have to shell out for a proper digital camera."
1,Not a good buy,This camera is not a good buy. The picture quality is horrible and it's impossible to improve. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,OK but too expensive for what it is,The picture quality is horrible. It's all fuzzy and needs a hella lot of lighting. I have to turn on 2 lights to get an average video. Not good for a first buy.
2,Logitech can do better than this...,"Normally something Logitech rules the house! I spent about $... with a $... rebate on 2 of these...about $.../camera. I expected to get decent quality out of them. I have seen the x-10 cameras that have pretty good quality for under $20.Needless to say, Logitech has disappointed this time...a first! The pictures are really grainy at 320 and not so bad at 640. The camera is easy to setup.I recommend downloading the install from their website. If you use the CD, it is a few revisions behind AND throws a lot of unneeded stuff on your system, such as Real Player and Yahoo IM. If I want them, I will download them. However, I also understand marketing and profit margins.I may try the other Logitech cams or search for good reviews on other products.Bob"
1,Yeesh. Take this camera -- please.,"I like the color orange. I like it a lot. I also like red. It's just that, crazy me, I don't like every image that I take with this cam to be red and orage. I like dots, too, but I don't like my pictures to look like a collection of orange and red wads of gum stuck to a wall. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a camera that's rated better than this one. I am returning it. Oh, plus the software that comes with it is a joke. Feh."
3,Not worth the retail price.,I purchased this camera on sale with rebates and paid much less than retail. The camera operates fine for me but the quality of the picture is not very good. If you have bright lighting it works fine although it is tough to get it to look focused unless what you are capturing is very close to the camera. The software that comes with it allows you to take snapshots and video clips. It provides software to broadcast your webcame to the world but you will need to eventually pay for a spotlife account and this is the only option given by the software. If you are buying this to just let the kids mess around and make little video clips or just for instant messenger duty it will work fine. Just don't purchase for the retail price! FIY - I have mine hooked to a HP N5495 PIII 1.06 GHZ 512 MB Win XP Home laptop. For the price I paid I'm satisfied with the results of this average beginner webcam.
3,Basic webcam,"I have owned / used this item for 1 year. The price is great - and it works very well for online messaging & chatting. Downside - focus is sometimes fuzzy, the base doesn't hold the cam well on top of my computer - i have to set it on a flat surface. Also, its not good for snapshots - only for online viewing. Sometimes the tint is a little green. But overall, for the price, it works well for a basic webcam."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I've owned and used probably 4 or 5 webcams over the years, and this one has been one of the worst. I bought it at Wal-Mart, because it was so cheap ($29?), and felt like I had nothing to loose in trying it. Well, it performs like a $29 webcam. The picture is pretty bad except under full sunlight. And no amount of tweeking with software controls can make a lower-light picture look decent. Grainy, bad contrast, and color-shifted."
1,"Junk, complete and utter junk","Ive been using Quickcams for several years.. recently i was forced to replace my QuickCam VC because logitech cant figure out how to write a Win2000 driver for it. So i figured id get the QuickCam at the same price point that the VC was when I bought it. What a mistake.. the Express cam is junk.. total junk. The old VC cam had a crystal clear image. The Express' image is grainy, discolored, and unfocusable. Do not buy this cam. Its a complete waste of money. Im very surprised that Logitech even sells this thing as they have a reputation for quality products. Obviously they are going down hill."
5,This is one great book.,This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I think that the way that Barbara's character was written was so dead on and so perfectly pathetically snarky that it makes this book a work of genius. I alternated between feeling badly for the characters and also laughing out loud. It is truly a good book.
3,See Film then Read Book,"I saw the film two weeks ago and learned that it was an adaptation of this novel. The film was so good that I really had to read the book because the book usually has more insight into the characters. But this was not the case with this novel. The novel was good but left you with a feeling of incompleteness. The ending had to many dangling ends. The book did do a better job of defining Sheba than the film did and the novel was really much different in content that to see the film and to read the book are two different experiences. So, if you saw the film, by all means read this book."
3,"more interesting, more character depth than the movie","In this story with a first-person narrator (Barbara) recounting the scandal her friend (Sheba) has gotten herself into, I disagree with the reviewers who accepted the narrator's point of view at face value. I think Barbara's account of the scandal is deeply unreliable, even when she reports her own messy part in the story. But that's one of the exciting factors in reading this swiftly moving story, trying to figure out what actually happened versus Barbara's narrative of what happened. As for the very open-ended last page, it may be frustrating for those who like their ends all neatly tied up (and it's quite different from the movie), but it does leave the reader wondering whether Barbara really has everything as under control as she thinks she does."
3,enjoy long weekend with a book,"Nashville City Paper BookClub Column - May 27, 2004What Was She Thinking- Notes on a Scandal by Zo Heller (Henry Holt) will soon be out in paperback. The author of Everything You Want to Know manages to make her characters comical and creepy.Saralee Terry Woods is President of BookMan/BookWoman Books in Nashville, and Larry D. Woods is an attorney."
4,friendship turned obsessive...,"History teacher Barbara Covell doesn't have much of a life of her own. Although she'd never admit it, she is desperately lonely. But then relatively bohemian Sheba Hart joins the staff at her school and befriends her.But Sheba is not an innocent... she is found having an affair with one of her underage pupils. But even then Barbara is willing to accept that Sheba is simply nave and takes it upon herself to take control and stand up for her friend. She wants to be the ultimate friend in need ... why can't Sheba appreciate that? Why won't she simply let her take over and make everything right? Why is she once again being scorned?This is a story of hidden agendas, ulterior motives, malice and of `friendship' turning into obsession. It is dark, chilling, well-paced and hard to put down."
4,Sharp and Insightful,"This book is a cleverly crafted psychological study of several people, all of whom are unaware of just how loathsome they really are. Clear and dark portrait of the tendency to be self-delusional in the perception of one's own behavior. Very dark, very funny."
3,What WAS she thinking????,"I think I am in the minority here, but I didnt like this book. It is well written, but I found both characters terribly annoying, each for their own reasons. Barbara is weak and pathetic and lives her life through other people, but perhaps that is the reason she is Sheba's friend. And I found Sheba to be an unbelievable character, not because she has had an affair with a student, but because she just seems so clueless about life. I got very irritated with both women and found their whole relationship to be entirely false. Sure it is well written and witty, but I couldnt wait to finish it and start something else."
3,What was I thinking?,"Something about this book made it hard for me to like. I was an easy read and a good enough story but there wasn't one character I liked. All of them were irritating, especially the main characters! The book also lacked any excitement (although there were plenty of chances for exciting moments).I also couldn't get it out of my mind that I was reading a book about the Mary Kay L. scandal, although it is more of a story of the narrator's pathetic obsession than about the affair. Bottom line: OK story, OK read, not memorable."
2,"Great potential, but poor follow-through","Although the foreward was intriguing, I found it difficult to actually finish the book. As I continued reading, I kept hoping for some type of excitement - but the incessant drone of the narrator made this a perfect need-to-get-sleepy book.The conclusions that I drew about the main characters in the first quarter of the book were the same as at the end - they evolved very little and very little new information was learned that was beneficial to character development.Overall, I'm a bit disappointed. For a plot with so much potential (two obsessions intertwined), this book dodged every chance at excitement."
3,This book is creepy!,"""What was she thinking"" is the story of a secondary school teacher, Sheba, who has an affair with one of her students. It is narrated by her friend Barbara, also a teacher at the same school.I admired this book, but I didn't like it. Not one of the characters was appealling. Barbara who narrates the story is downright creepy, obsessed with her friend's life and determined to make Sheba dependent upon her. It felt a bit like seeing into the mind of a psychopath (minus the violent behaviour). Sheba is probably the most likeable character, but you feel like shaking her for making such a colossal mess of her life. Stephen, with whom she has the affair, is just an immature boy and it's hard to see why she becomes so enamored with him.The book is well written but it's quite slow and feels a bit predictable - although the ending brings it all together very well."
4,Witty and Sinister,"At first glance you may be inclined to include this novel in the Brit lit/Chick lit genre. It's anything but. Sixtysomething school teacher Barbara Covett's life appears to be a bitter, dull affair. She is contemptuous of both her colleagues and students, and appears to be little more than a lonley, friendless spinster. There is however a lot more going on with the mild mannered Barbara than may be evident at first glance. When she meets Sheba Hart, the new art teacher, Barbara develops what could only be described as an ""unusual"" attachment. The married forty year old Sheba has her own secrets as well. She's carrying on an illicit affair with one of her students. Barbara's growing attachment to Sheba is both fascinating and disturbing, and the novel is both scathingly funny and highly literate(you may well need to haul out the dictionary a time or two). Barbara may be a mousy ""old bag"" (as she describes herself), but for my money she's a force to be reckoned with."
3,Notes on mental illness untreated!,The plot is scandalous and there is no question about that but what really moved me beyond the lives of the two main characters (Barbara and Sheba) was the gentle reminder about how mental illness can become a real disaster if gone untreated. I agree with another reader that this book makes an excellent read for a book club. There are so many social issues that Barbara as unbalanced as she appears to be brings up and they all make great topics for some heated discussions. I guess it goes to show we all bleed the same regardless of our differences.There are probably so many women out there who could relate to both Barbara and Sheba and reading this book may push them to look at their lives from a different frame of mind.
5,Careless Love,"What a good book! Too bad it takes place in England. It seems to me there was a case similar in USA where the teacher was jailed, resumed affair upon release, became pregnant, was jailed again. The boy's mother was vexed but no one could keep them apart. Interesting is that all Heller's characters have their motivations revealed. However, they do seem rather shallow people all trying to put their own little goals into action, especially the main teacher-lover. But she is usually in a daze and becomes a stalker when she is dumped. The wisest one may be the angry daughter. Who wouldn''t be angry living in the midst of such oafs?"
2,Could have been better,"Although the topic of this book is interesting in itself, the authour missed an opportunity to do it any real justice. This book is easy to read and in parts very insightful, but at the end it isn't a very memorable or worthwhile read. I keep wondering why I even bothered."
3,Unmenmorable but an easy read,I have read better and I expected more from this book. It is weird and good but it doesn't leave you with anything special or any deep insights.
2,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this book because it was on the best sellers list. I said it was a true story about a teacher who has a romantic and sexual relationship with a 15yo boy and gets caught.. I was expecting to find out the teachers motives and possibly more about her sentence for doing the ""dirty deed"", but alas I was struck dumb when I read the book and found it to be written from a fellow teacher/friend point of view. It never got into any professional's point of view. It doesn't even go into the trial at all. It was mostly about this lonely teacher/friend who uses the teacher as her ""pet"" to fill her lonely days.. I did not like it, but if you just want a quick read about a sordid affair, go right ahead and order it..No problems (as usual) with the order or promptness in receiving it. I love to buy all my books on Amazon."
4,Play it for sport...or for blood,"This is such an original idea for a game, it can't help but be good. It also can't help but be hard. You HAVE to know your movies to even begin contemplating this thing. But if you do it's surprising fun.The joy here, though, doesn't have to be about accuracy so much as making up plausible defenses for your conclusions. There are more laughs getting the answer wrong than right.Yet, it certainly CAN be played ruthlessly, if the occasion arises. There's actually a little strategy to the game, and with a knowledgeable enough crowd, you could easily slip into cutthroat championships."
4,A really strong beyblade...,"This beyblade is really good. As soon as you lauch this beyblade its Egine Gear kicks in. I tested this beyblade out against Diger V . As soon as Driger G hit the stadium floor,its engine gear kicked in. When its Egine Gear activated it slammed into Driger V and it went flying. Overall this Beyblade is really good. you should buy it."
4,Driger G,"Driger Gatling or Driger G, is a must have Beyblade for serious players. Here are it's parts:Attack Ring- Triple TigerWeight Disk- 10 BalanceSpin Gear- Right Engine Gear Semi FlatBlade Base- Fast Clutch Driger GThe most useful part on this Beyblade is Triple Tiger, the attack ring. It is good for upper attack combinations and smash attack combinations. Just because this has an Engine Gear, doesn't make it good. If you wan't to win with an uncustomized Driger G, do not wind up the Engine.Ratings:Preformance Uncustomized 6/10Usefulness of Parts 8/10Overall 9/10"
3,"Driger G, Doesn't impess me (HaHaHaHaaaaa)","This blade is one of the most normal, plainest blades ever! Oh,it may look alright but its like any other blade because its gimmick doesn't work and has no real power. It was even deafeated by its so-called ancestor form, Driger S!"
1,"Poor, Even for a Statistics Book","I found this book to be poorly organized and poorly written. Within the chapters, the authors jump around between problems, text, definitions, etc. The text was poorly written and unhelpful from a layman's point of view. I found the book unhelpful for learning statistics, and wouldn't recommend it."
1,The Worst Book on the Planet,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!This by far the worst book I have come accross in my life.I am a mechanical engineer taking statistics for my MBA. Fortunately I have a very good intstructor so I dont even use the book.Its worthless. Seems like the author is talking to himself.
1,The worst one among intro statistics books.,"My MBA class (top 20 program)used this book. But even my instructor did not recommend us to read this book. Instead he just taught class with his own hand-out. We only used this book for exercise problems. There were students who had many years of research experience. But they even complained about this book and recommended me to read Anderson's "" Statistics for Business and Economics"". Anyway, I think if you have a good instructor it is O.K. Otherwise I am sure that it will be very painful. Gook luck."
1,wow,"You better hope you have a good teacher. Don't use it as a last resort to study, if you can even find where a certain topic starts, its nearly impossible to follow."
3,"Very Similar to ""Waiting for Nick""","Early Nora Roberts novel with similar plot to ""Waiting for Nick"" in the Stanislaski series, which was superior. Good book, but been there, done that.Excerpt from the back of the book:""How dare Brandon Carstairs walk into Raven Williams life after all these years! The mesmerizing musician had broken her heart; now, he was back with a passionate proposal. Were the benefits of a musical collaboration worth the risks that a reunion could entail? Raven had graduated from the school of hard knocks-but would she ever be able to forget Brandon's lessons in loving?"""
2,"nora roberts, whats going on","Honestly I cannot get past how promiscuous the hero was between him and the heroine. it seriously took away from my enjoyment of the book. the love story was alright, but nothing spectactular."
1,Worst Nora Ever,I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts and read her books religiously. I have loved almost every book of hers that I picked up but I did not like this one at all! It was cliche and Brand was an A-hole. You can skip this one.
5,As Described,"I looked at several different compatable batteries, but am glad I went with the JVC, not only was it the same name brand as my video camera but between the one that came with the camera and this additional that I bought I was able to take all the video I needed and was never without power."
5,Best battery for everio,"There are three choices for everio...VF808- Very small, but only lasts around 1 hr.VF815- Not to big, lasts around 2.5 hrs.VF823- Lasts between 3.5-4 hrs...., but it very big for this samll camcorder...In muy opinion, get two 815 for long recordings."
5,Just the right size for my compact Everio Camcorders:,"The battery life of the smaller version is too short, and the larger one would be too big for the compact camcorder. so this is just right."
3,good price,"below my expectation, one hour and half at the most. Probably because was a refurbished battery."
1,not compatible,"I bought this item becuase Amazon grouped together this battery, the JVC Everio GZ-MG330 30 GB Hard Disk Drive Camcorder with 35x Optical Zoom, and the camera bag at a discounted rate. Once I paid and received the items I noticed this battery does not accommodate the video camera. Just some FYI so you don't repeat the same mistake."
5,Being Born by Sheila Kitzinger,"A lovely, sensitive book for children about the process we all went through before and during birth. Black background highlights white print and awe-inspiring real photos of the developing baby. Written in the second person (at six months you did this), children imagine it as themselves. Conception is handled gently and can easily be skipped if your children aren't ready to hear this ... though you will probably find Kitzinger's treatment of this subject entirely inoffensive and non-threatening. When my daughters were little, it used to be one of their favorite library books. All I can say is, this is one of the most beautiful books I've ever seen!"
2,"Focused, but undisiplined","I believe this book makes a valid point for the pularity of companies today. There are just enough tidbits to make the read worthwhile. However, I found the book frustrating. The author suffers from disclipine. He makes poor use of analogies and the book, while chock full of examples, could many times be examples of the contra opionion: diversification. The author would benifit from application of scientific rigor that would add depth and credibility to his copious but superficial use of examples. Perhaps exploring a corporate strategy of diversification would of given him the credibility I needed to swallow all his claims. Without it he comes off as someone who makes up his mind what position he wants and then grasps anything possible to support his ideal. For those interested in the subject I relay the maxim, ""Concentrate when in control otherwise diversify."""
4,good metronome,"good size, good functions, good volume, the only complaint is the on/off button might get accidentally pressed and left on without notice."
3,Good Book,"I have to only give this book three stars. I am a beginner quilter, maybe an advanced beginner, and found this book to be repetitive. I actually bought the book for one certain quilt pattern, and for the price I was okay with that. Normally I like to get a little more bang for my buck. All in all though, out of 30 quilts I found three I plan to make. It does show how color choice and use can make a huge difference. The photos are awesome, the directions are clear and easy to follow. For that reason I would recommend this book. Not so sure it one I would want to keep on the reference shelf, but that is just my personal taste. I am sure that many quilter's would find this a must have book. I do not recommend this for a very new, just starting, quilter unless you have a friend or really helpful local quilt store to help you out from time to time."
4,Good book,This book gives you some good ideas to inspire you to create a beautiful quilt. I have used and lent it to people many times.
3,"Great patterns, lousy directions","This book has beautiful patterns, but the directions given on how to put the pieces together are definitely for an advanced quilter. I would have preferred a bit more specific instruction then just a picture when trying to figure out how to put all the triangles and squares together."
3,Not bad.,"Steppenwolf is the first of Herman Hesse's works I have read, and it won't be the last. Although the first 80 pages are fairly hard to get through, the rest of the book makes the trek well worth it. The ""Magic Theatre"" scene is one of the most imaginative pieces of literature I've ever read. However, as I said before, the first third of the book is very slow and boring, as most of those pages are just Harry Haller (the main character) reading the mysterious ""treatise,"" a strange type of analysis of Harry, which was given to him by an unknown person. The treatise is boring and hard to follow. The rest of the book is a fairly easy read and you will find yourself tearing through to the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who's into stories with a surreal edge to them. The only reason I didn't give Steppenwolf more than 3 stars was because of it's slow beginning."
2,A turgid mess,"Reading this ""novel"" is like wading through molasses. It's unbelievably slow and turgid -- and all about how the protagonist is a genius, but unrecognized in the world (and yet, what has Haller actually ever done? He's only special because Hesse tells us so). It's hard to believe that this is great literature when we have the likes of Joyce, who can draw us a character going through existential despair in a few pages, and leave you aching.Any story in ""Dubliners"" has more depth and feeling than the whole ""Treatise of the Steppenwolf"", and in fewer pages by far."
2,what a disappointment...,"The Version translated by Basil Creighton just does not work: as I go along, I can almost see the translator's efforts and getting stuck: as a native German speaker, I can certainly hear the German sentences and, frankly, I not only shall try and find a later translation (this one dates from 1929) - I am left with deep regret that I did not search out the German text. No doubt Hesse went through the text, but that does not always ensure a good translation, either. Beware when you read: this is not a good read for these reasons - unfortunately."
3,Better As A Satire,"Harry Haller is the spokesman for angsty teenagers and poseur Goths. Haller feels he is caught in a continuous battle between his baser and nobler desires, the wolf and the man within him, and the paths of happy mediocrity and agonizing transcendence. He searches for spiritual beauty; it's no wonder he can't find it, as he refuses to acknowledge in himself and others. He believes his self-imposed suffering makes him better than the ""bourgeois"" a.k.a. everyone else. He cuts himself off and wonders why he feels lonely. He whines continuously about how misunderstood he is.To me, this book is an excellent satire of the angsty artiste who revels in misery. I am not at all sure that Hesse meant it in this way, but literature is open to interpretation. The prose is beautiful and there are some fantastical and creative passages. I recommend it--but keep a critical eye open, and don't forget the grain of salt."
3,Steppenwolf,"The psychological journey that Herman Hesse leads you through in Steppenwolf is worth the read, yet, his various diversions and unorthodox writing style sometimes makes it a painful journey."
4,Truly for mad men only!,"When I first tried to read this in my early twenties, I had a dreadful time with it and abandoned it early on as I did not have the life experience to fully understand what Hermann Hesse was writing about. Now, almost twenty years later, I am transfixed and can identify with Harry Haller. Not an easy read and parts still went over my head but a must read none the less! We are all in some aspect The Steppenwolf. Hermann Hesse has created another brilliant novel."
3,Born To Be Wild?,"The second Hesse book I've read, and I quite liked it. I'm sure many could pick it apart and analyze at length. I simply enjoyed the writing and message as I took it: live life, carpe diem, laugh, etc.I'll admit 1/4 into the book I struggled to keep interest, but with the arrival of Hermine things really picked-up. I agree with the thought that all of us have many sides to ourselves. We all have an animal within. Why not let the beast free on occasion?Now I crave the touch of a woman, the taste of a cigar, and the sounds of Mozart."
3,My Review on Steppenwolf,"This novel was very well written, but I think it was too complicated for me. I consider myself a pretty good reader, but I was blown away by his far superior and obviously honed vocabulary skills but writing skills also. There was a lot of run-on sentences and it was hard to understand most of the time. This book is not for people who love lots of action, but someone who likes to analyze every bit and piece. That is why this book would be perfect for school reading material or an advanced reader unlike myself. I would never read this book for the shear fun of it and I don't think I will ever read it again. Don't get me wrong by thinking that I didn't enjoy this book because I enjoyed it! If it was more understandable for me, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more."
2,strictly for pre-teens,"I'm an admirer of Hesse's ""Glass Bead Game,"" which I see as a complex, mature work, deserving of a careful read. And Hesse's ""Siddhartha"" was also pleasing, though sharply limited in scope.But ""Steppenwolf""? ""I, the homeless, the Steppenwolf, the solitary, the hater of life's petty conventions . . . .""Oh, sheesh. What are you, 14?"
5,Shared Knowledge,My book was exactly as described. I'm glad that I was able to get inexpensive books as well as help a good cause!
4,Magnetic or Suction Mount Antenna,I use the Suctions Mount Antenna because I remove from sight whenever I leave my car which is idea for my purposes. The antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock. The only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up.
5,REMOTE ANTENNA,"My Garmin Nuvi 350 appears to work fine without the remote and we pick up the sat signals with just the built-in antenna. But we'll use it to keep the Nuvi out of the direct sunlight on the dash, and it allows my wife to have the Nuvi in her lap for easier programming and reading. If it's not there we just place it in the console and go by voice driving instructions. Works great and we don't need to rely on the windshield suction cup holders for the Nuvi."
1,Poor Equipment,"Actually, I should say the description was poor. With a better description of the C330 and mount, I would never have purchased it and be out shipping cost both ways."
5,Improved performance with 2610,I mainly bought this so I could install my 2610 GPS in my dash. It works better than the internal antenna.
3,ADD ON ANTENNA,NOT REALLY NEEDED AND CORD IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO REACH REAR OF CAR UNLESS YOU BUY AN EXTENTION UNITS INTERNAL ANTENNA SEEMS TO DO FINE ON ITS OWNEVEN UNDER STEEL ROOFS
2,antenna,I have tried to use this item inside and it has not proven to increase reception. Save your money.
5,Garmin Auto Antenna,I am very happy with this antenna. It does exactly what it says it will do and was easy to connect and attach to the car. The price was better than the Garmin website and it arrived pretty quickly.
3,Garmin remote antenna,After exhausting shopping for my Garmin the need for this antenna was somewhat uncertain. Since it was offered at a discount associated with my G 2730 I bought it. I don't need the antenna. The G 2730 has a built in antenna that even on WAAS does a supurb job on sitting on the slide-out cup holder from the dash of my F-150.
3,"Helpful, but not dramatic","I bought the additional antenna for around $60 to improve the signal for my Garmin iQue M3 combination PDA and GPS. The antenna seems to help a little, but not significant. I needed any help I could get as I use the M3 heavily for work with lots of multi-state driving, and hearing ""satellite signal lost"" just when you need to make a turn, etc. is very aggravating. I found that locating on driver side, near edge of windshield helped in areas of dense trees (overhanging from passenger side of road). I use suction cup mount, I don't know if magnetic would help (though someone else commented exterior mount was much better), but wasn't sure how to route/connect ""neatly"" outside of vehicle or if I wanted to do this way."
4,works fine for me,I also have the nuvi 660 and loke it I got bot of these together because I didn't want to have a problem with connecting to satswithout the antenna I get a 20-30 ft accuracy with it is always less than 10 ft most all the timeI use the magnet and have a 99 F-150 and put it on the roof just behind the center brake light I just took out the light and there is holes and you have to use a small rat tail file to make a U shape in the plastic on the light so the wire doesen't get pinched by it when back in placethe only problem with this is the type of wire used is low to med quality wire some high quality shieled wire there would be less leakage and a better signal
4,Helpful for Garmin 76CS GPS,"I own a Garmin 76CS GPS. Prior to purchasing this antenna, I would lose signal when driving in Boston- which is where I need it most! I now am able to keep signal almost all of the time (except in the tunnels of course.) Sometimes though the accuracy of the location goes to 80-100 feet and the GPS is unable to determine just where on the road I am currently located- but it doesn't completely lose signal.From what I've read, the newer Garmin 76CSx models have a much better/sensitive chip inside them- perhaps for those models this antenna won't improve the signal much. But for the older models when driving between tall buildings, I've found it a necessity."
3,Antenna Not Sensitive Enough,"This antenna ought to work through the windscreen; it does not. It works patchily when I place it directly under the moonroof on the sliding shade. It works perfectly only when I place it completely outside the vehicle. The windscreen mount was therefore a waste of time and money - I should have taken the advice I got from no less than a Garmin salesperson to purchase the cheaper antenna for $31.00. Whether this is all the fault of the antenna or that there is some peculiar unique ""firewall"" in my 2007 Toyota Camry windscreen (or the electroluminiscent rearview mirror) - I do not know, but it seems to me that paying big money for an item without caveat or exclusions for certian vehicles should secure just what the item promises: that it would work through the windscreen with or without a mount."
2,Inappropriate for Elementary,"Wow! How shocking it is to crack open the book for 1st grade and see nudity, then have to put the text out of reach due to evolution being clearly taught. I feel that to teach a love for learning, then color over and put the text out of reach is as much a contradiction as teaching my k and 1st graders evolution. It is not that I am opposed to the introduction of other ideas, but not at 1st grade!"
3,ok product,The product it self is okey. It works finely. But I did not see any special character than other detergents. And the detergent powder dispensing is not very convenient.
1,Be Aware! No Customer Service with Cowon Products,"The Cowon iAudio U3 is an excellent product while it works, just be advised that I have found it difficult, if not impossible to contact Cowon for warrenty service on my iAudio U3. The sound failed after about 3 months of use. My emails to Cowon, a company who lists no phone numbers or addresses, remain unanswered with later attempts returned as undeliverable."
1,Does hold anywhere near 4GB,"I have the iAudio U3 2GB player. I love it. So I bought the 4G version.The 4GB does not hold as much as the 2GB does. On the 4GB, there is over 2GB in 571 hidden files that can't be seen, accessed, deleted. That leave about 1.8GB for my use. As I said, I can get more on my 2GB unit.4,057,956,352 bytes total disk space.16,384 bytes in 1 hidden files.2,490,368 bytes in 152 folders.2,189,770,752 bytes in 521 files.1,865,662,464 bytes available on disk.16,384 bytes in each allocation unit.247,678 total allocation units on disk.113,871 allocation units available on disk.I have tried getting ahold of the iAudio folks, but haven't received any reply. If I don't get this fixed in the next day or two, I will be returning it."
2,Doesn't work to well,"I love this product, the software and sound is excellent/ even teh video is great; however, one of the channels stopped working and it comes out mono. After almost no use at all.Its a big disappointment that screams to me "" why didn't I just buy anipod!"""
4,Great Player,"I bought this audio player because I use Linux and I've loaded my music library in the ogg vorbis format, and the players from Cowon happen to support that format out of the box.I haven't had this player for too long but what I've seen so far is great. The audio playback quality is excellent. I can upload songs to it easily from Rhythmbox and it keeps track of things pretty intuitively.I normally keep it on shuffle for the entire library. I did find it a little difficult to remember how to navigate by folders (so I could just listen to one album) but I probably wouldn't have had such trouble if I had actually read any of the manual on it. That is really my only problem with the player at this point. Definitely worth purchasing."
5,One of the better episodes,Very high quality new information never seen before connected with this subject. Definately worth the price. Especially if you are about to visit some of these megaliths.
4,Great as entertainment,"This series is great for entertainment purposes, yet anyone who jumps to the conclusion that it must be aliens if something isn't understood should awaken one's inner sceptic. This makes them no different then the people that assume that if something isn't explainable then some divine being must be responsible. Not trying to encourage atheism, but skeptisism as they claim this is a theory, but yet I see no scientific fact. But I do like all the stories behind it, they do teach some facinating things about various cultures, I just take it at face value. This is entertainment, not a science."
2,I would rent this...,"Seasons 1 & 2 are fun to watch. Believe or don't believe, you will be entertained. Some of the theories are slippery slopes and tend to jump to conclusions...Season 3 details larger ideas presented in the previous seasons. The problem with S3 was that I wasn't interested in many of the topics (supernatural Halloween, American Old West, cults, American Founding Fathers). Some episodes were decent (Evil Places, Sacred Places). None were outstanding. It's time to evolve the series from Ancient Aliens to Modern Aliens and see some modern theories and types of alien species. Again, I welcome the benign and the ludicrous (but, if it's alluded that Jesus Christ was an alien hybrid again, I may stop watching...seems like every other episode they are saying this just to annoy any religious people)."
5,where not alone,"I just wish they had more answers, the show is very interesting and a lot of things are true.thank you"
4,You can't help but wonder,"First, let me say that I am a rational man that understands the truth about the Easter Bunny, the Toothe Fairy, and Santa Claus. Many of the arguements that they make on these episodes are REALLY good questions, that if listened too with a truly open mind expand your horizons. In the past all you heard about was Stonehenge and the Egyptian Pyramids, but until these shows I hadn't realized what an ancient civilization India had and what they add to the question of ancient aliens. Admittedly there are some suppositions that they make that I am not will to go along with, but when they ask why/how did the ancients build with huge blocks of stone that we would have difficulty with with modern machinery I say, that's a damn good question! Keep an open mind and take a look at these!"
2,now or eva,"i put off 2 many thangs in my lyf, it now tyme to act. 2marow ima buy a ANIMAl, maybe a cat, if wake up at all. ima goin 2 the mall, not for work thos tym(my dae off) but 2 buy ddis dvd. ima get rye bread, neva had it and dat guy at da deli always acts me. ima go to gamstop and trade in my gamcube, prolly get store cred."
1,The History Channel is Desperate for Viewers.,"Thanks to shows like this I have to deal with ignorant twits who think Alien visitors are real because it was on a presumably factual program how many times to I have to hear ""It was on the *blah blah* channel so its real !""My guess is that places like the History Channel and the discovery channel resort to junk programming for the same reason fast food restaurants don't sell salad - when it comes right down to it, people like junk."
4,"Good, but not season 1","The video was a repeat of some of the material found in the videos for season 1 and 2, but the new information was very helpful to understanding the Ancient Astronaut Theory. I felt that season 1 was the very best, as seasons 2 and 3 seemed to borrow extensively from that video."
2,Hmmm?,"I saw a few episodes of this program, interesting theory but doesn't really proves anything. The Ancient Astronauts theory maybe possible. Trillions of solar systems out there, I'm sure there are beings somewhere in the universe who are thousands or millions of times advance than us."
5,BdayGift,I got this as a gift and it was a perfect thought. It has been constantly viewed and put to good use. It arrived in a speedy manner and I truly appreciate it
5,Still Hooked,"That Georgios guy, who clearly is the money behind it all, is one Sagan-esque engaging erudite. Smart usually equals boring.But not here. I do not usually go for the ding dong stuff, space cadet fan boy stuff, or the History Channel. Not a hater. Used to be waaaaaayy into it.Just moved on to the HBO Rome, HBO Game of Thrones, Walking Dead level of trippy entertainment.But then a Joe Rogan podCast had dude on as a guest.Georgios, our Ancient Aliens host, was so cool it was not even funny.Give the guy a shot, check out his work, and dig the fine business of his efforts ...His comrades, colleagues, and contemporaries are also all rather superherb superb.Avoid the BlueRay.Who needs the PC hassles of chasing codecs or software, paying costs, and making us go to the blogs, threads, or TPB for solution suggestions?"
5,Ancient aliens dvd,Bought fOr my partner to complete his collection. Came very quickly great service. Great DVD also very interesting ad good to have the whole collection.
4,Ancient aliens is fantastic!,"I not only suggest season 3 of ancient aliens but also all the rest of them as well. This show states the facts, and then let's you decide what's you think is to be true. I'm in love with the show and look forward to many more! One of my favorite episodes would be aliens and the creation of man, on season 3."
4,Ancient Aliens,Really good stuff if you like the whole they were here and this is what we got from there visit.
4,Fun video,"This is a fun video if you don't take these things seriously. I love the way they use the term ""Ancient Alien Theorists"" as though it was some kind of established discipline. The conspiracy theorists have worked overtime on this one, neatly tying together the founding of America with visitations from aliens, wisdom of ancient cultures and the Freemasons. The narration is good, they have nice visuals and serious sounding articulate ""experts"". All in all a fun time."
5,"U GOT LOVE IT, U GOT HAVE IT IN YOUR COLLECTION","TOO MANY QUESTIONS, AND WHY TOO MANY ANSWER ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO HUMANITY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, BUT THE RESERCHES GAVE US GOOD EXPLANATIONS ABOUT WHAT COULD HAD HAVE HAPPEN. DEFENITIVE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE IN YOUR HOME. TOTALLY I RECOMEND THIS DOCUMENTARIES, TOTALLY AMAZING.Ancient Aliens: Season Three"
2,3rd season fell off a bit,"first season and second season of ancient aliens were GREAT. this one isn't terrible, but it's more modern cryptozoology than ancient aliens. a lot of the familiar authors are back, but it doesn't have the same bone-chilling impact as the first two seasons. understandably feels like all the best material was covered in season 1 & 2 and this was made not because of more compelling evidence, but rather to exploit the 'brand"" popularity with loose associations"
3,"Ancient Aliens, Season 3","This DVD is very much in the same foremat as the previous two. There is not too much new in the way of concepts or ideas. The proponents of alien visitation and their probable contribution to humanity is believable, but belabored. This didactic approach, I believe, takes away the need to think beyond the proposed ideas. Whether one believes in the idea of ETs is, however, emphasized. The whole program is to make it believable, but has the opposite effect. It is, nonetheless, an intriguing possibility we all should contemplate."
4,"better than cops &robbers, plenty of life left in genre series","with vast hours up watching docos on ufo's ancients, & this series , not over it yet ,area 51, never watch any crime waste of time ncis ect, future series could adress the link between mars faces/ spinx pyrmids &egypt/other worldwide ones , the photo's of mars translucent tubes ,50 pyramids on a plain ,remains of mega tree &possible scrub cyclic growth& die back , question if mars iorn core is gone , then is it possible that cities are inside there?with this small area alone many more programs to be filled, as well build on the past titles ,indians myths , nazi connection s von brawn,tesla 's lost notebooks , arthur c clarkes witness of ufo's &knowledge of face /pyramids on mars, I WANT TO SEE MORE , DON'T YOU ?GOOD STUFF KEEP IT UP .

5,GREAT DVD!,I bought this through e-bay and money well spent. It has the best picture quality to Date and the info is the SAME Thank you History Channel for such a Great Job!
1,"annoying, slow, needs to be babysat",Length:: 2:24 Minsa quick overview of how it should work and why you shouldn't buy it.
3,slow charger!,"While you can charge the ipod with a single AA, it's VERY slow. The battery gets hot while charging, and when its done, the ipod only gets about 25-35% charge (from empty). To get a fully charged ipod, you need to repeat 3-4 times. Useful but not convenient."
1,Didn't work and may have ruined my iPod,"Well, not only did it only work for like less than 10 minutes ... now my iPod mysteriously won't take any charge at all. I have it plugged in right now for charging and it keeps rebooting itself and won't take the charge. Special."
1,What a piece of junk,"What a piece of junk, this thing hardly works at all. I never write reviews but I felt compelled to do so for this horrible product, so no one else has to waste their money. I bought the iTurbo to use on an overseas trip, so I could use it on the airplane and bus rides and such. It only worked the first time I tried it. After that, it barely did any charging. I went through about 10 batteries just to get about a minute of play time on my iPod. I just ended up buying the Apple charger while in England at twice the cost as in the states. Do not waste your $ on this item!!!"
1,Terrible Product,This is a terrible product...do not buy!! it not only fails to charge my Ipod - it has actually drained the remaining charge. Tried to contact the company about the issue...no response.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I thought this would be a convenient product to use when I need to charge my Ipod, boy was I wrong. First off, you will only get a complete charge if your battery is more than half full. If your battery is almost dead dont waste your time using this charger. Secondly you will have to change the battery more than 5 times, and even then it may still not be completely charged. I went through 5 new batteries and my Ipod was still not completely charged.So if you have the time and the batteries then go for it, otherwise get a charger that you can plug into an outlet."
1,Eeek! Don't use a rechargeable!,It would have been helpful if the instructions had mentioned NOT to use a rechargeable AA -- mine is now stuck and the device is worthless before I even had a chance to use it. I am PISSED.
4,Another no-brainer.,"$50 bucks for a sexy, leather or carbon-fiber wrapped back up that has to be charged.$5 for a back-up that recharges instantly ... by inserting a new AA battery.No, you don't get weeks of back-up - just how far from home are you?This unit isn't much bigger or heavier than the AA battery inside.It will get you through a day or two or three - depending on your usage.Not as pretty as the $50 units ... but not as expensive either. And not a hard case, but seems durable.It's belt-buckle simple, does what it promises, and is refillable almost anywhere.And at $5, you can scatter them: car, brief case, office - then you've always got one handy.And though it says 'iPad / iPhone', iFound a stock USB cable with the same tip so the unit I have can run either iUnits or PC / USB items - cell phones, mp-players, etc. (4 stars because I had to find my own PC tip)Works good, price is very right, fast delivery - gets my vote."
1,BAD DO NOT BUY I REPEAT DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i was so stupid i looked at all the reviews and i still bought it is a lesson learned this is cheap for a reason because its not good at all i put this to charge on my iphone and my iphone says this item does not work with you phone not really wat it sed that but im explaining to what it said simliar because i forgot what it saifd but yes something will pop up in the screen saying it wont work yes at first it will work for only 10 seconds!!!!!! den after that will not werk or charge anything ever again so dont waist your money on something so cheap!!! this does not even deserve a one star
1,"poor customer service, no replacement cord","Product was working well as an emergency power supply. I needed a replacement cord which I was willing to purchase. I had already been supplied a special cord for my LG phone. After multiple telephone and email attempts to contact customer service, I finally got a reply. They stated that no replacement cord is available, even for a price. Since it is a detachable cord, it can easily be lost or damaged. Better to look for another power option with a better customer service dept."
5,GREAT SOFTWARE MORE THAN PERFECT,"I have been using this software since version 7, i was totally satisfied with it, but since i am using the CS for PC and MAC (i use both platform), this is more than a perfect software, i really think that after this one, Adobe Photoshop needs to fix some small buuuuugs maybe but a slight work. it happens to me once that it just damage the file while i was working on it, i had to rework on it, but it happened just on time. I have been a graphic-designer for almost 11 years, and in 2005 i have both the 2 cs version (MAC/PC). they are so far expensive, but i do not regret bying them, i recommend this 100%. there are some little problems but they are no harm for your work. GREAT, GOOD, PERFECT SOFTWARE.Designers, trust me that is worth the price eighter for Mac user nor PC."
5,Great witness movie for my 12 year old granddaughter!,I have watched Jefferson and Kelly Moore movies and bought Clancy. My granddaughter began watching it and loved it.I recommend all of their movies!
4,expect the unexpected,"Toatally different to the other ones but well done, once we worked out what the message was."
3,"""Clancy"" tries really hard!","I've only recently started watching modern Christian films. ""Clancy"" tries hard to be one of the better ones, but I think it falls short. The message is good, but the acting is somewhat clunky, the pacing is too slow, and some aspects of the film are a little too saccharine-sweet and not as believable. I still recommend it, but there are definitely better Christian movies available (""Courageous"", for example)."
2,They don't enunciate!,"I guess it's my own fault for buying a DVD when I didn't know anything about the characters, but I was REALLY disappointed when I heard how the Teletubbies talk. It's much worse than the baby-type-speech that Elmo uses, they're almost impossible to understand.Also, it's 80 minutes long, and I think that's just way too long for any kid to sit in front of the TV. I realize it's possible to turn the movie off in the middle, because I did, but I prefer for my child's DVDs to be about 30 minutes long.Honestly, we only watched half of it once, because I was pretty disturbed by how unintelligible they are, but my daughter did love it, especially the baby in the sun, and the repeated ""Big Hug."" She's been talking about the ""Tellies"" for two weeks now. I keep telling her the DVD is broken."
1,Trane would not be pleased!,"Grey's doctoral dissertation proves that PhDs are too easy to buy today. The writing and organization is sophomoric at best (average high school level). Highly opinionated (without any supporting facts and/or a logical presentation of such) and void of any educated exchanges of ideas, ""Dr."" Grey begins by a vicious attack upon other Coltrane biographers to justify his ramblings in pursuit of his letters. Grey simply uses Coltrane as an excuse to vent his racist anger pent up in a time warp from his socialist activities in the 60's. He is blinded by color -missing by light years the message Trane worked so hard to express. Coltrane would not be pleased. He rejected both underlying themes here - anger and racism. I see why this is a ""self"" published book. If you are a lover and fan of Coltrane -as I am - you will do much better by seeking truth and knowledge elsewhere."
2,"Amusing, but pointless","There were a lot of interesting and humorous moments in this novel, but as soon as I finished it, I thought to myself .. 'that's it?' I felt sorely dissapointed by how abruptly it ended. There seemed to be some themes that escalated, then dropped off without warning.I think the author is talented, but there's just something missing. I felt especially cheated that there was never a true resolution to the cherry nipples. If he were to write another book, though, I'd probably read it."
1,Sucky Movie,"I like a good Horror movie. This one got fairly good reviews. They lied, or were planted. The movie sucks. Very bad acting by unknown actors. Usually expected. But these people were the bottom of the barrel of Bad actors. The movie plot was very weak. But most annoying, was the overused sound effect of the startling loud banging of a large steel door, at the end of a long hallway sound, that ALL these elcheapo Horror movies use anymore, to surprise you, especially after a very quiet scene, where the actors are practically whispering to each other. Then, you already expect the loud BANG, noise to happen. And it does. Too often. I hate movies with no substance, and excessive annoying startling sound effects. GRINDhouse Road must be a gag title, the Movie Producer chose, because this garbage is rehashed Grind Garbage effects and acting and plot used in all the low budget trash. It isn't worth a second watching. The first was annoying enough."
5,Great Tool at a Bargain Price,Works great! I used it on my Porsche race car to tension the belts to factory specs. Much better than hand tensioning.
4,belt tensioners,The product it seems would be very versatile but it was unclear from the product description which of the two on offer would be best for my purpose of measuring tension on the main drive belt of a Can-Am Spyder. The belt being a Flat-toothed type.The model 91107 that I ordered suits my purpose but I cant tell if I got the model intended for this use. But all in all a very economical and easy way to check tensios when you know what they should be.Gates 91107 Belt Tension Tester
1,Total junk,"Don't be surprised if your belt snaps on you while you're trying to tension it to the spec using this junk. This tester consistently reads values that are like 1/2 what the actual tension is. Perhaps it works on that one exact belt they used to calibrate it, but I couldn't care less because it is not the belt my car uses. Too bad there is no 0-star rating, as this is exactly what this product earns. The price under $20 for a working tension gauge sounds too good to be true? Then it probably is."
2,I will give it a try,"As I don't have anything to compare it to, I am unsure of the accuracy. You push on a ""clicker"", like a child's toy and then read a scale. It is not a ""high resolution"" tool but it is not expensive and I will give it a try. Of course one can get a ballpark estimate by judging the distance pushed with a finger. I guess I like the idea of a second estimate... I would be curious what professional mechanics think but I guess they are used to estimating by ""feel""."
4,friends make me laugh,"I enjoyed the show the first time around and I'm now enjoying it again, and again. Maybe there is no big story line, maybe there is no 1st rate acting .... but the show and the characters make me laugh out loud!!! Life, work and just alot of day-to-day stuff are not funny and to have the ability to watch and literally laugh out loud - it is almost like medicine for my spirit .... laugh and the world laughs with you, etc ... I say a big ""thanks"" to the friends."
5,Just can't agree that terrible review!,"I'm not a guy seeing lots of TV, but I really like Friends. Once a time it was the only one I wanted to watch after work. It gave me so much relax. I think Friends really gave me what I wanted, some funny things that made me laugh, instead of consider the serious real world problems that already gave me too much headach.I never wrote review at amazon. I speak because the horrible review makes me feel that my favorite show was hurt, and I can do something to make the hurt less."
4,Tickle Bee Challenge,"I ordered Tickle Bee for my grandaughter because my children, now in their late 30s and early 40s loved this game when they were very young (about kindergarten to 3rd grade.) They literally wore it out trying to get the bee from start to finish without stopping him."
3,Poor Construction,My daughter is five years old & has hardly played with it. I think it's a cute concept which I've found myself playing with. I hope she grows into it... I was also disappointed in the quality. It is constructed of non durable materials.
4,A blast from the past !,Lots of fun to play at 5 or 50. There is a string to keep away from itty bitty kids and cats.
2,Tickle Bee,"My son had this game in the 1970's and it was played with over and over,, so I ordered 3 for my grandchildren. I was so disappointed when they arrived as they are cheaply made of flimsy plastic. The kids love the game but because of the poor quality, my daughters have placed them in the kids' quiet time boxes, so they can enjoy them sometimes, but can also be calm and quiet with them. I paid $11.85 each, and expected a higher quality item."
4,Great toy for 3 year old,"My grand-nephew likes this new toy and plays with it for hours. Unfortunately, my sister, his grandmother, likes it too."
3,Had One As A Child,Had this one in the 60's. Simple. Easy to play. My 4 year old grandson liked it for about 15 min which is about as good as it gets. Good car option. One player. No batteries. No lost parts.
3,not real exciting,"This is kind of fun, is an old toy from my childhood. compete against...tough for it to compete against video games."
2,"Eats batteries, Reads +5-7 if plugged into wall wart.","Tech Support response: ""Yeah they run hot if you plug the power supply in. Just run it on the batteries. ""If you don't plug it in, it doesn't project."
2,Less than expected,"I've had this unit for several years, can do some things effective -- outside/inside temp -- humidity, but have no way of verifying accuracy.Now the temp and humidity for outdoors and indoors have gone blank. I've replaced batteries still to no avail. There is no place in the manual to instruct where to remedy. There is no service telephone and their website has no contact option for issues such as mine.Unless I find a reasonable answer, this weather toy will go on the electronic trash heap."
4,Weather on the flip side,"This product is accurate and verbose, the projection is useless unless you are completely out of lightbulbs and sitting in the pitch black abyss of twilight. It measures barometry but does not articulate it in a numerical style. Overall this weather device lets me know when it is hot and cold. Kudos."
2,Batteries last about 1 week!,I am very disapointed in this product. The batteries last a very short time so most of the time I do not get any readings on the inside monitor. Alot of money for something that doesn't work!
3,Weather Channel WS-9031 TWC,This weather station gives yo a lot of information but the manual on how it operates is a little complicated. The inside temperature is clearly off about 2 degrees. The outside temperature and humidity is pretty accurate. Do not waste your time using the stick on tape for the remote as it will not hold very long.
2,Doesn't work as mentioned... AVOID this.,"The Digipower battery doesn't work as mentioned. It is much worse compared to the original Canon NB-1LH battery, charge lasts much lesser than original one. Pay some extra bucks and get the real one."
2,Not worth the money !,"Doesn't last as long as Canon one, also takes slightly longer to charge. I think its not worth buying this one, Canon one is much better."
1,Low quality Li-ion battery. Buyer be aware!,Stopped recharging within 6 months. Buy the original Canon battery. Waste of money
1,Disappointed in usage time,Don't expect to get the same amount of usage out of this battery as you do the original. My experience was to get about half of the shots with or without flash as I do with the original before the BP-CN1L quits and needs a recharge.
1,JUNK! Does not hold charge for more than 10 shots!,Bought this as a replacement for my original battery in my Canon S200 digital camera. Worked once for approx 3/4 the time that the OEM battery held charge. Now it wont hold a charge for more than 10 pictures. Waste of money and time.
2,Weak plug makes this cable too delicate,"I am on my third one of these cords for my Street Pilot. I am very careful when plugging and unplugging, but when it gets cold, the cord gets too stiff and puts strain on the connection where it hooks into the GPS. Then the battery connection is broken and you either buy lots of AA batts or a new cord."
3,missing in action,"I could not do without my garmin street pilot, however I have to replacespeaker and plug in, the unit has not been used enough have to replacedesign weakness."
2,More boring than relaxing.,"I bought this album on impulse after seeing it on sale in a used CD shop. Now I know why it was there to begin with! The music from start to finish has no hooks to draw one's attention or keep the listener engaged, and the lyrics had no real substance to them, only repeating the same lines and the same concepts without progressing to a definite point for one to follow. The leader of this group says he took five years to write the songs for this album. It should have taken him five HOURS. For a better example of relaxing music with vocals and lyrics, check out Deep Heart's Core by Kate Price."
1,Dissappointed,"Based on the other review of this game and from watching the show,had high hopes for this game. Actual game was not at all what I expected. Before you can ""pimp"" a car, you have to play another game to earn money. Played once and may not play again."
1,...,"This can't be serious... There's no point anymore. I don't know who on earth would think this would be a good idea, and I know I am gonna get a lot of hate for this... but.. *points gun at head*"
5,Focused venting!,"My kids (6 and 8) love this game! I love it becuase they can work out some extra energy without running all over the house. There are a few different games to play including a timed game and a memory game. Simple, take the hammer and whack the mole with the lighted miners cap. This thing keeps track of how many you hit and the sounds the moles make are so adorable. I was giggling watching my kids play. Loads of fun!"
5,Whacky for Whack-A-Mole,"I bought this for Christmas last year and my 2 boys, 2 and 5 still play with it. Isn't it true the more expensive toys either get broken or lose interest...not this one. Not only is it great for the kids, but the parents too. You don't have to be familiar with the characters or hip on the lingo. Just whack that mole. The only drawback is that there is no volume control and the music gets a little repetitious after playing awhile."
4,My 4 year old loves this game!,"I have a four year old boy who absolutely loves this game! Not only is it fun with the voices and sound effects, but he gets to pound on something and not get in trouble for it! I also think it is helping his eye/hand coordination. The most important thing is that he and his daddy have a lot of fun playing it together. There are only two problems; it's a little loud, and really not usuable in a bright room. We find that if we dim the lights in the evening we can play easily enough, but when it's bright it's too hard to see the lights."
4,Interesting and Different Game,"Whac-A-Mole is different than any other game I have seen on the market. I bought it for my 4 year old daughter's birthday and she loves it, except she gets angry because if she doesn't hit the moles directly in the center or if she doesn't hit them hard enough, then she doesn't get credit for the whac. My 6 year old son is better at the game and he really enjoys playing. I would recommend this game, but probably for ages 5 and up."
5,Therapy in a toy,"I got this toy for a friend for Christmas. She said it would only take her 15 minutes to break it (she has a lot of anger), but it's lasted almost a year now... We love it! We even named the different moles (it makes your score go down, but you get to act out against someone without doing anything stupid - ;)). Seriously, the toy is amusing and a great deal."
5,Best value toy,"I bought this for Christmas for my 20-month old. My 4-year old loves playing this. I was fearful that my boys would be bopping each other rather than the moles, but it turned out NOT to be the case...I am so thankful this product keeps them entertained. The one disadvantage is there is no volume control and the repetitive rhythm may drive you nuts if you are not actually involved in the playing. Great value from Amazon!"
3,broke after 20 minutes,Very disappointed in this product. Fun while it lasted. Broke after only 20 minutes on Christmas morning.
5,Super game for all ages.,"My family has always been a big fan of Wack-a-Mole at the arcades, this is a great home game version. The moles don't pop up, the top of their heads light up, and you wack them with the plastic mallets. There are 3 different types of games...solo, follow me (a memory type game) and head to head (2 player). The 2 player is a little frustrating for kids, and they often find their opponent blocking their mole, and some bruises can result. That's about the only complaint I would have though. The game is ready to play out of the box (after putting in batteries)...a nice change from so many toys these days that require assembly and stickers put on. Highly recommended!"
1,This is not the trance DJ Sasha,"I don't who's name came first, but this artist is not the same DJ Sasha that is so well known in the trance community. Don't be fooled!! Get Airdrawndagger, Involver, or any of the Global Underground releases instead."
1,Whew...what a terrible experience,"Thinking this would be ""Sasha,"" I am now incredibly dissapointed. Whoops. This is not ""sasha"" holding down the club, this sucks-and it is not ""easy listening."""
2,This guy should change his name,"I think is a very sad thing to take advantage of a well wnown name; this guy is not Shasha the DJ, is a new singer with a romantic-melancolic style... with this guy I remembres the pseudo artists that in the 70`s under the shadow of Bruce Lee, called themselves ""Bruce le"", or ""Bruce Lai"".Is a very decent work, thats why I give to it 2 stars, but, shame on this guy, honestly, he should change his artistic name."
3,Not your typical Sasha album,"This album takes a major detour from the usual Sasha album. No remixes here. Not at all like Airdrawndagger. His vocals, yeah that's right he's singing, his vocals are strong but odd since that is what you hear the most, instead of trance like house music. This album is easy listening music with a little pop. That is why I give it 3 stars since I was expecting more trance like music but got easy listening instead. NOT going to be listened to very often."
3,The VHS version was better,"This was several DVDs, but the VHS version was better of just the single DVD. The original did a good job of showing the moves necessary to get the motions. The DVDs are too artsie & sexy. Yes, the art of bellydancing is sensual, but I wanted a ""workout"" as the title mentions. I also wanted the DVD so I could give up my VHS player. Oh well, gave the DVDs to a friend."
3,Aerobic Bellydance,"If you are wanting to learn how to belly dance this is not what you are looking for as it does not teach you many key elements. Conversely, if you are looking for a belly dancing inspired workout dvd this would be perfect for you. I like using this dvd but believe that it is advertized wrong, thus my rating. In general it is a relaxing workout, but the lady can get annoying at times. Possibly a personal issue?"
1,Save Your Money,Thought it was a great deal. It looked decent and I was able to download music okay. The only thing is that it is always freezing up and then won't even turn off. I keep having to remove the battery to restart it. Don't bother with this piece of junk!!!
3,"For the younger kids, maybe.","I got one for my 8 year old and my 13 year old. I notice that my 13 year old is stopping at the end of certain songs, it wont go to the next song, and freezes up. She can't do anything but take the battery out and restart it. Also for some unknown reason it was making this loud squeeking noise. I notice when my son turned his on sometimes it only display half of the work COBY. I figure something at the low cost would be good for the kids but it seems to be giving them problems and they haven't dropped it or anything. They may have only had it for 4 days. Maybe I should had invested in a better quality mp3 player."
2,Wouldn't Recommend.,"I bought this Mp3 player as something cheap to use while skiing so I wouldn't have to use my expensive one and risk breaking it.I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody. 256MB is only about 50 songs, which you have to scroll through yourself. There is no menu to find certain songs you want to listen to. After a few weeks, mine started speaking giberish. If I went to the menu, it would look something like SJ#$#@^%(JFS.The battery time is only a few hours, and the USB connection is something I've never seen before. If you lose the cable, as I did, somehow, then there's no way to use it again. I've been trying to look online for something similar to it but I just can't find one."
3,works well,this mp3 player seems to hold together pretty well. some of the controls are a little strange though. sound quality is good and a little loud so it uses batteries quicker.
3,Decent beginner advice but too religious for my taste,"I'm not religious and I like a book to tell me it's a religious book before I've purchased it. You'll here a lot of religion in this particular finance book. Good, but very basic, instruction on cutting costs and budgeting. You are probably better off with ""A Mom's Guide to Family Finance,"" or a straight finance book. I gave this book away as it didn't really change any of my practices."
5,A pleasant scent in a nicely made jar that will last a long time!,"I've bought this candle over and over! In the jar, the candle will burn for a very long time. Unlike cheaper candles & knock-offs, the Yankee Candle company really delivers with their product. The scent is one that never grows old to me, and I don't mind if it lingers throughout my office or house. It's non-invasive and doesn't give me a headache like other heavy scents. The jars are so nice that I keep them and re-use them for DIY projects!"
3,Oversimplification,"Three points: 1. A beginning student absolutely should take a formal course in introductory Italian BEFORE buying this set of CD's. Otherwise the student will founder badly as the CD's progress! 2. The female student on the CD's is a HUGE aggravation for the listener. She consistently fails to ""think"" before speaking; she steps on the instructions of the tutor; she consistently offers so many multiple guesses to questions that the listener quickly forgets the original question. 3. The final two tapes deteriorate quickly in terms of the quality of teaching. They are hasty and offer incomplete explanations, almost as if the tutor has grown weary of the task."
1,Very bizarre recordings,"The method in this course could work for some. That is if you can get past the teachers disgusting cotton mouth, lip smacking, and thick accent from god knows where. Michel Thomas is not a native italian to my knowledge. The previous reviews have pointed out how frustrating it can be to hear the students grapple with their answers."
5,This software is excellent!,I have learnt more Italian that has stuck using the first four CDs of Michel Thomas' course than I learned in one year of 'two-hour-a-week' tertiary study! I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn Italian.
1,Find another program - Awful!,"Michel Thomas is terrible. I think his idea about teaching is good, but he is NOT a native Italian speaker and the CDs consist of two students mispronouncing and misstating Italian over and over again, then Michel Thomas in his heavily accented English, speaking Italian. Mr. Thomas has a German-sounding accent and constantly speaks over the students.Honestly, you are ready to explode. No one on these CDs speaks Italian with a native accent. The constant corrections of the students is annoying and not helpful at all.I am so glad I didn't purchase this program. What a WASTE of my time."
1,How to Learn Italian with an American Accent,"Terrible product.No native Italian speakers. Students on CD make frequent mistakes emprinting incorrect phrases on your brain.Lessons are disorganized, follow no pattern, and teach isolated impractical phrases."
4,Good language course,"I rate this good, not great. I've listened to this and the Pimsleur series both. If you can't afford the 30 lessons of the Pimsleur series then Michel Thomas is the one for you. They are well done and you get a lot out of it. I found the Pimsleur approach more thorough but both are good."
1,Profoundly irritating,"Eight profoundly irritating CDs of three way conversations out of left field (the first thing I need to learn in Italian would probably be ""where is the hotel?"", not ""it is not possible for me that way""). Each person on the CD has a different accent, adding to the confusion, and the intermittent beeps (you are instructed to hit the pause button and form an answer every time you hear this beep) is enough to make you want to tear your hair out."
4,Girl on the recording hinders the affect,"The course is great, but the girl in the class annoys me with her accent."
4,"Episodes 17, 18, and 19 are artful and well written.","Well, they are. Even if Quatre looks really weird in a couple scenes. I really love it when Wufei comes busting into the fight scene ((again)) and saving Duo and Quatre's tails. At the end of one of the episodes Heero delivers this really crushing monologue, condemning human kind's activities in space. Its cool how you hear him talking for... three minutes, I guess, then you get to see over his shoulder that the notepad he's reading out of is completely blank. Duo's dark humour when he's captured is really just a perfect piece of chracterization. That scene displays Duo just as he is. Overall, these aren't THE greatest Gundam Wing episodes ((they get progressively better)) but they sure are good."
5,A really cool story,"I can't exactly tell what episodes this is yet, but I can tell you that you'll like it nomatter which ones there are. Gundam Wing is about giant robots who wage war against each other, but that's not all. Political divisions pop up everywhere, and top-notch animation makes the story even better. I recommend this to anyone."
2,Not for all hair types,"After doing tons of research I decided to try this since my hair had some color damage. Bad idea I was finally getting my hair back to being healthy and this just made me take about 10 steps back :'( . I have curly, fine hair. I followed directions exactly and after rinsing out step 1 my hair felt kind of soft but then once I did step two and my hair was still wet I thought ok this seems good. I styled my hair and for a while it looked shiny but after a while my hair got extremely dry and frizzy. I looked like a cotton ball on my head. I was freaking out to say the least. The next day on my way to Sally's I scratched my head and felt I huge piece of skin that flaked off my scalp. I mean it was the size of my thumb nail. Worse thing ever! I bought a packet of silk elements and coconut oil and thank God that worked wonders. Be careful when using this. I'm sure it is a good product, but like I said before its not for everyone."
3,Not for my hair type,"I used this in conjunction with the recommended same brand shampoo/conditioner and used a hand-dryer to harden. My hair is usually very frizzy, breaks very easily, sheds constantly and has split ends. After using this my hair was more tangly and got creases from my flat-iron and seemed more brittle, though after I washed it again it has seemed to calm down. I don't know if my less than stellar results are because of my hair type since it is also very dry or the hand-dryer. I do like the other products by this brand however I think next I will try a keratin treatment instead and see what those effects will be.As to the smell, it wasn't horrible and reminded me of old-school Sun-In that you'd blow-dry into your hair to get blonde (orange) highlights"
2,The stench!,"Bought from Sally's. I used it as instructed exactly on the package.While it did seem to make a difference in making my hair look and feel more smooth, the stench is overwhelming and lasts for days.Sorry, but no results are worth the odor from this stuff for me."
4,ApHogee Two Step,"I've only used this product once. So far, I can't tell a difference. My hair still has breakage. It may have been too far gone for the product to help. I will use it again in about 6 weeks and see what happens."
3,Too harsh,"This product is too strong. After using this product, my hair was breaking in tiny pieces whenever I comb or shake my head. I have used Jamaican Black Castor Oil Protein treatment and I received greater results."
4,The hard part is the longest,"I use this probably every 4-6 weeks to give my hair a little extra strength and smoothness. I also use the second step and although, I dont really care for how sticky it is, it does seem to improve the texture of my hair. Basically, you wash your hair and coat it with this product (it is sticky and a little gross) Make sure that you get ALL of your hair, especially the top of the back. You then sit under a dryer or use a hand dryer (DO NO AGITATE HAIR) until it is rock hard. I mean literally like a pack of egg noodles, which can take 30+ minutes. after that you rinse it out and apply step 2. Step 2 then softens the hair and leaves it silky smooth. In my opinion, it really is a 2 step process. I thought the price on amazon was great and I tried it because 4 different people told me about it. I would recommend it.Ps. I am african american with bra strap length, wavy/curly hair that is dyed."
2,Not happy :(,"Well I don't know what went wrong, but this did not seem to work. Instead my hair broke off in smaller ringlets. I followed directions to the ""T"", and tried to rinse as thoroughly as possible, but an hour of rinsing it out in the shower was still not enough - because my hair was DRY DRY DRY... I knew this would happen based on other reviews so I armed myself by applying the Aphogee balancing moisturizing conditoner along with Shea Moisture leave in and Avocado butter, but the dryness was a little too powerful. I am literally afraid to use this stuff again... oh, and why didn't anyone warn me about the rank smell... All I could think was, ""This $#&@ stinks to high heaven!""Oh well. the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I would never have found out about Aphogee Balancing Moisturizing conditioner had I not went in search for the protien treatment."
3,Too much of a good thing,"I have very long hair (mid-back), unprocessed, but plenty of split ends and dryness at the ends. This product (applied, then followed by the balancing moisturizer as instructed) did make the hair heavier and shinier, but also stiffer and drier, such that it tangles and catches a lot, resulting in even more split ends. I compensate by using a deep conditioner after washing and a lot of Citrishine, which is a leave-in conditioner. Prior to Aphogee treatment, one spray of Citrishine on my palms rubbed together then rubbed over my hair was plenty; more made it greasy. Now I need five or six sprays to keep the hair soft. So I'd say this product performs as promised, but it is not the best treatment for long hair with split ends. From now on I'll stick to lots of moisturizing conditioner, and only the lightest of protein treatments."
5,Great Hair Treatment,"I have used this product for years and highly recommend it. Several years ago I grew my hair long and this was the key to keeping it healthly during the transition. I had stopped using it for awhile when I started wearing my hair short, but starting having issues with my hair breaking and shedding. I started using it again a few months ago and my hair is healthy once again and growing nicely. It is very important to follow the directions with this product. I follow up with the recommended Aphogee balancing moisturizer, but I follow that with a second moisturizing conditioner. Although the Protein conditioner is great, I don't think the Aphogee moisture works great on my hair (that's why I follow up with a second one). I now use this every 5 weeks and couldn't be happier with the results."
1,NOT the Two Step Treatment,I received the Two Minute Reconstructor...which is not the same product at all. Very disappointed because I have used the Two Step Treatment and love it.
3,confused,"i used this product yesterday. i'm aware thats its a heavy duty protein product, thats why i'm confused as to why it left my hair silky soft but not stronger. my hair is still breaking the same amount while it is wet. I used a clarifying and moisturizing shampoo, put the treatment, did exactly what the instructions say. use the balancing moisturizer , my deep conditioner and the rinse that came with it. could it be that my hair needs more protein? 6 weeks from now i will try this product again to see if the issue is my hair or the product."
3,Stinks,"The smell is so bad, worse than rotten food! Does leave hair soft! I won't buy again due to the smell."
2,Did not notice much of a difference after an ordeal to apply,This is a nuisance to apply and afterwards I did not notice much of a difference in my hair quality.
1,Animal Protein?!? Terrible.,"This product contains animal protein, as in it's not animal-friendly. There are plenty of vegetable or synthetic protein products out there. Try Dieci by La Brasiliana. You can get it for a great price on Amazon ~$14, and the texture feels great on the hair. The bottle is a good size too, 8.8 oz. Plus, it's no 2-step process, so simpler than this.The seller should post the ingredients; I only found them out from another websie. It's not worth killing an animal, taking any life, just so we can look good."
5,aphogee 2 step protein treatment really works miracles,"Aphogee Two-step Treatment Protein for Damaged Hair 16 oz.This product really does work, follow directions exactly and your hair will be repaired. My daughter had completely fried hair after a bad high lighting, the hair was so damaged she was going to cut it all off. We tried the aphogee 2 step treatment and her hair was repaired to the point that she loved it. I highly recommend this product."
5,Quality Product,I purchased this on amazon because it was so much cheaper than Mitsu. Product worked just as good for alot less money.
5,Soulful,Moss' voice takes you on a journey. She has a unique ability to transport you to a different place. A voice that you won't forget soon.
1,What a sorry piece of equipment,"Again trying to cook at mom's. I wanted to nuke some vegies. The dial on this microwave is hard to grab, especially with wet hands. I can overlook the goofy appearance of this item, but the fact that the setup of the low knob being hard to use makes this a real dog. Please mom enough already. I know you love Rachael, but your going overboard.I got a great microwave at sears for $50 bucks. Sure it doesn't have Rachael's groovey lable, but I can live with that."
2,Just a 6,"ProsMicro wave.Grill.Retro design and color scheme.ConsHeight.Slow warming heat bulb.Cumbersome Menu system.Just Cumbersome to use.--------------------------I give it about a 6 it would be a 5 without the grill, it is about 100$ which I feel the RR name added 30$ to the cost of it,but if you don't mind the clunky menu system and the quirky way it works its not bad,but you will find better for the same price.."
4,RRR (Rachel Ray Rocks!),"Oh my, this Rachel Ray microwave is the best appliance in my kitchen, well next to my pink Kitchen Aid. The knob controls is so simple and easy to use, even my wife can figure this one out!My only complaint is that it doesn't come in orange, to match the cookware set....Rachael Ray 10-Piece Stainless-Steel Cookware Set"
3,Informative,"If you are looking to learn a bit about Mormon history, this book will teach you a great deal. The early chapters are devoted to the early days of the LDS Church under founder Joseph Smith. There is a fair amount of material contained in these relatively short and easy-to-read chapters.One thing that bothered me a bit about this book was the almost sarcastic tone that seemed to pervade the entire work. Granted, a Christian will want to point out the dangers of false doctrine in the strongest terms possible, but this can be done with an evangelical tone. Mark Cares' book ""Speaking the Truth in Love to Mormons"" does just that.Other than that, ""Saints of Another God"" gives a good short history of Mormonism. Other than the sarcasm, it's a very quick and informative read."
2,it's a lemon,"I was ready to really love this pda. It's nice and thin, feels good in the hand and was the cheapest PDA with wireless. I mainly needed it to check my email when i'm out and about.But I have to admit that it's a lemon. It freezes all the time, I have to pull the battery out to reset it at least once a day, sometimes 3 or 4 times. I haven't installed anything on it but what came out of the box. Also, just too little on-board RAM, and if you save your applications on the SD card instead they are SO slow.HP's firmware and ROM updates from their websites actually made it worst. It's more stable with just the 1.00.00 firmware version out of the box. My only hope is that it's a Windows Mobile 5.0 problem and there will be an update soon. I don't know if it's Microsoft's problem or HPs, but now it's definitely my problem."
5,Best Anniversary Present,"I bought this for my husband on our Anniversary. He loved it has really come in handy from him as he needs a lot of phone numbers to be stored for work and a calendar to keep his ever changing work schedule in. Also, allows him to access wireless internet if he needs to."
1,once the warranty is over....,My ipaq rx1900 worked a little more than a year during which it needed reseting many times. After the warranty expired one day I couldnt turned it on anymore. I contacted hp and it was impossible to find a physical address to take it or mail it to get it fixed. it seems that after the warranty is over HP expect you to toss your device and buy a new one.
3,Great Pocket PC for basic use,"The style is great and very easy to handle. It is easy to personalize, to an extent. The battery life is very good. I can use it at different points of the day, and still not have to plug in power for about 4 days before the battery life is down to below 30%. The only quirk that I have experienced with it, and it's a very annoying quirk at that, is that when you check a mail account on a POP server with Outlook, it will freeze up the majority of the time. When it does freeze up, you have to take the battery out to reset it. This also happens when using Pocket MSN for the services it offers. Beyond those two things, everything has worked flawlessly. I would recommend this product for basic mobility, but not for heavy productivity."
2,"Nice Features, But LOTS of Bugs!","I ""upgraded"" to the rx1950 after being very satisfied with the earlier rz1715, which used Windows Mobile 2003. The rx1950 uses Windows Mobile 5.0, which I now realize has many bugs that have yet to be worked out. The problems mentioned by other reviewers- they are REAL! After spending HOURS on the phone with HP technical service and performing multiple software upgrades and hard resets, some of the problems seem to be fixed, but others persist. One in particular- the unit will not effectively sync with my desktop Windows Media Player. Licensed media files will not play. I'm very disappointed that HP released a product with so many faults."
2,Skip this product,"I have owned several PDA's ever since the first Palm Pilot hit the market back in the mid 90's (which, btw, still works fine). The OS on the HP locks up too much for me. I am not used to having my PDAs lock up. I can't say my Pilot or my current Palm Treo never lock up... but I can't remember the last time they did. The HP Wi-Fi and bluetooth work well, I give them that. However, the SD card slot broke just after the warrantee expired and now its useless. There are too many other good PDAs on the market to waste your time with this one."
2,Wait until the bugs are out,"I purchased my rx1955 about two weeks ago and I've been having a lot of similar problems as the other reviews, namely the on/off button doesn't work half the time and I have to do a ""soft reset"". I've called HP and they will be sending me a new one, but after reading the other reviews I'm not too confident that the next one won't do the exact same thing. Also, since it has Windows Mobile 5.0 there are a few things that I've tried to download (mainly readers) that aren't compatible. The battery runs down very quickly with an SD card. So, all-in-all, I wouldn't purchase this thing again until they work all the bugs out."
2,Ipaq Rx1955 needs reset to turn on; poor battery; slow,"I would have given the ipaq rx1955 4 stars if I can turn it on using the power button, and if it had a decent battery. Most of the time I'd have to reset the rx1955 to turn it on. Some people suggested a few fixes: leaving it out of the case, removing the SD card, and/or charging it with the SD removed. Not sure if any of these will work consistently. The CPU is underpower, but that's to expect with a low-end PDA from HP. Other than that, it's compact size and bright screen are perfect for my use. No issues yet with the O.S. and the Activesync software. Warranty is a pathetic 90 days by HP (online purchase) so that's how much confidence HP has with their iPaq Rx1955."
3,On/Off problem,"It may be coincidental but ever since I quit using my personal photo for the background, I have not seen the problem of needing to soft-reset to turn on or off the device."
1,"Flimsy hardware, abysmal customer service","i got one of these pieces of crap for my wife for xmas. She was unplugging the cable when the plug came apart and spat bits and pieces all over the place. HP sent a new cable, telling us that they've had a real problem with the plug coming apart. Well, the damage didn't end there. When the plug came apart, the receptacle on the PDA got damaged. HP is refusing to repair it under warranty, despite the fact that they've acknowledged the cable problem. They want $210 plus shipping to repair it, and are claiming that the damage was our fault. The whole plug/receptacle assembly is one of the cheapest and most fragile designs I've ever seen in consumer electronics. It will be a durability problem for pretty much anybody. HP is being a bunch of (...)about the whole thing, and I'd think twice about getting ANY HP PDA. Maybe try the Del Axim."
2,Ditto Ditto Ditto,"I have to agree with the other reviewerss. The rx1955 is not a great success in terms of handhelds. I found that the SD does not necessarily drain the battery, because if you remove it and replace it the unit comes on with the battery with power. This is real convenient.I am generally a big HP fan, but on this item."
2,Don't Bother,From Palm to Poc PC to Palm. I previously had an HP2215 which was ok if you don't mind having your XL formatting changed. The 1955 was not as good as the 2215. I am back with palm and am happy.
2,Same power on/off problem,"As most of the other reviewers I had the same problem. When the unit turned itself off, the only way to get it back on was to do a reset. The unit worked great when it did turn on, the wireless was a snap. The memory was less but it was not a deal breaker for me.I could live with that much memory but Unfortunately, the power on/off problem is not something that I could live with so I had to return it."
2,rx1955 is not the iPAQ to get,"The rx1955 will drain your battery to nothing in a matter of two or three days if an SD card is installed. Further, the Samsung 300mhz processor is inadequate. It is not fast enough to run Skype, and handles many simple tasks in slugish fashion. I parted out my rx1955 to repair the broken screen on my iPAQ 4155. The 4155 is a much better unit. Too bad they stopped making them."
1,Buyer beware,"At the moment I am in the middle of a 3-day ordeal sorting out Outlook 2002, which comes with the ipaq. Outlook 2002 has many many many known bugs (which only now I find out) and I can't for the life of me figure out why HP would ship it with their hardware. DO NOT INSTALL OUTLOOK 2002 on your machine.The ipaq itself may be OK, but if this is a foreshadowing of the fun to come..."
4,Pretty Good Book.,"This is an excellent book for anyone taking the series 7 exam. However, it doesn't have enough quizzes and tests to prepare you for the exam. The material in the book is enough to pass the exam. Every registered rep should (and probably does) have this book in their arsenal. A Definate buy!"
2,Payed too much and was left deflated...,"I was not extremely impressed with this text. For the price, I expected more reading. It was a book I could fit into my front pocket. I read it in its entirety in two settings. I thought it would be a little more humorous. I was expecting sarcasm but found it bordering cynanical."
3,What could have been...,"A nice little collection of quotations, but the author seems to rushed through the book, or was hindered by a tight page count. He could have added so many additional quotations, or tightened things up and added more of higher quality. He seems to stretch for quotations in the latter categories. Nevertheless, it's a nice read."
1,"These are not 18/10; stay far away, these are a complete waste of money and most likely hazardous to your health","I purchased this set about 5 months ago and already many, many pieces are discolored permanently and at least one has a spot that somehow lost its outermost layer of metal and has a 'hole' in it with a rusty center. It's shocking how low quality this flatware is. There is no way it is made of the metals claimed. Silverware is not supposed to rot and discolor within 6 months. It probably contains lead.The flatware looks nice and is heavy but it is ultra low quality and probably hazardous to your health.This product is made in China, I have probably been eating lead.My goal with my flatware purchase was to protect myself and not buy Chinese made flatware but I figured this set might be decent.It was an $80 miscalculation.DO NOT BUY CHINESE MADE FLATWARE!!!! PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY!!!"
1,Bloatware at its best,"Adobe is a big company and has tons of money, so why are they charging us an arm and a leg for bloatware that runs very slow? Launching the program takes half a minute on my 6-month-old PC with 512 mb RAM. A lot of things are hard to understand, which means you'll need to shell out more cash for a learning book, and Adobe wants you to buy their expensive books! Get jasc or other better products from independent software publishers. There's even a decent open-source (and free) image editing program."
5,Upgrades Not the way to go.,"I purchased the old version of Photoshop CS because I had upgraded my computer from the original photoshop 3 with upgrades. After having my computer crash from an automatic upgrade they had to reinstall the operating system. My photoshop upgrade would not work. A big mess.I recommend buying stand alone programs, not upgrades after this. Needless to say I like Photoshop CS."
3,their best record,"Other than the much earlier (and hard to get) ""Fables"", this is the best of Dan and John's recordings. It feels more like an album than the preceding ""Night Are Forever"" which sounds like it was thrown together. The first side is flawless; unlike another reviewer here I think ""Love is the One Thing We Hide"" is a great song, one of the best that Dan wrote. Side two starts out with 3 fairly weak tunes, but somehow they still work, maybe because the last two songs on the side are so strong. Great production and very good musicianship from all the players, especially the drumming of Larry Londin who can never get enough credit as far as I'm concerned."
1,Painful,"Yes, painful.The author drained the beauty and life out of Ephesians. I have studied four or five books of the Bible through this series of commentaries and have loved them all except this one. After 100 pages or so my study partner and I felt we could not continue. It was soooo boring. Excruciating!! Like the driest Prof. you have ever experienced. We switched to the Life Application commentary and love it. So save your money."
3,Very cool- too short.,"Great product for the price. Worked well after soaking in water for a loooooong time to saturate all beads. They are not long enough for an average adult's neck but perfect for a child (with supervision, of course)."
4,These really work!,"I work at Outdoor Living Museum and it has been one of the hottest summers on record. I needed something to help since I couldn't get to the AC. These did the trick. They really do work. I found that the fabric would dry out before the end of an 8 hour day,but the beads remained ""puffy"" so when I could, I just rewet the fabric. The beads stay up and keep you cool for days...really!!"
2,disappointed,"I had hoped for more from these bandanas. They cool your neck, and make you feel slightly cooler overall, but not very much. Perhaps because they are long and thin, so don't contact much of the neck? The concept is great, but I would not buy them again."
2,Works well but beware...,"I was quite excited to find these for such a good price since playing golf in 90+ weather could use some help cooling down. They work well especially if dunked in ice water BUT the color runs! I ruined 2 golf shirts (2 because I tried both colors) and the color transferred even after 'washing' them. If you have no shirt collar to worry about, they work great but don't use them with a polo shirt!"
1,not too cool!,"The transaction from the seller was fine, but the product doesn't really work... too bad, a good idea but not worth the money!"
1,cooling bandanas,"I thought this would be good to use in Disney World. Unfortunately, it did not perform as described. I was very disappointed (and hot)."
3,The answer to keeping your cool?,It is similar to keeping a wet cloth around your neck. Cold at first but then you must keep turning it over for coolness. Major advantage over a damp cloth: You can tie it around your neck. Major disadvantage: Storage after use. I wash them by hand and hang them on the shower rod when not needed.
2,Evercool Bandanas,"Good idea, are certainly cooling but I received red bandanas---- they run red dye when wet - I thought I ordered black or green or blue, anything but red, and you cannot use them unless you have dark clothing on because whatever the red touches is stained red. Definitely would not recommend them because of the dye running."
1,didn't make sense to begin with,"The seller delivered promptly. The product, however, doesn't work at all. It's not defective; it simply does not work. Wishful thinking made me believe in the unbelievable. A cold wet rag, on its own, will not remain cool in the heat. It will become hot. These chilled bandanas warm up quick so one might as well just use regular headbands."
4,Best personal cooling system for under $100!,"We purchased a 3-pack for $10. We used it on our recent trip to Disney World (Florida) where the temp. was in the low 90's & humidity was 75%+ daily. We were amazed at how well this item worked. We soaked them in water, inside a zip-loc, inside our room refrigerator overnight & the next day they kept us cool over 10+ hours in the parks.The only downside was the green one bled onto my white shirt, but it kept me comfortable. If I had known I would have hand-washed before using."
5,Keeping Cooler Now....................,"I purchased these items because I thought it would be easy to stay cool when I get hot flashes. They are portable, stay cool for a long time and saves on electricity. They work wonderfully and I would recommend this to others in the same menopausal state.I received the item extrememly quickly and had no problems with the ordering process. It was very easy.Thanks."
2,cooler bandanas,Absorbs liquid and is wet but didn't really make me feel cooler just damp. I won't even be using the others in the package. Save your money and buy a personal portable fan.
2,didn't really beat the heat,Bought these hoping they would help me beat the heat while running.We had several 90 degree days recently and I used them. Unfortunately they didn't stay cool for very long even after I putthem in the refrigerator for a day or too. They are fine for a shorttime but wouldn't say they really helped any more than using a wash cloth or other wet item.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this item to be used as a wrist wrap. I have pain in my wrist and arm daily. I figured this item would be great to wrap around my wrist. The beads are not throughout the bandana, so it wasn't going to work for me. It also doesn't stay cool for very long. I have a cooling bandana for my dog which uses the same material or technology, and it works better than this item. It would have been nice if the seller noted how big or long the beaded area is. Also, the colors that were shown in the image did not match up with what I received from them."
3,not enough gel,"Received quickly, smooth transaction. Disappointed in the amount of gel when the product is activated...there is not enough to be cooling for long."
4,Loved it...read it five times.,"This book gives an accurate history of the beginning of movie ""stars."" It also tells a romantic tale that intrigues young girls. All of the Sunfire books tell history in an interesting manner, but this was my favorite."
1,The only Sunfire book I didn't like.,I hated this book! It was the only Sunfire book I didn't like! It was soooo boring and lame! I couldn't stand this book!
1,False Advertising,"Like the previous review said, the version of ""The Lou Gehrig Story"" that is on this DVD is not the one that is advertised on the box. And the quality is absolutely horrible, as the movies look like fifth or sixth generation copies. Not even worth the dollar I paid for it, and it's unethical that the product is not what was advertised on the box."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I question the claim that the product is 18/10 stainless steel!! It is flimsier than other 18/10 SS I have. The tines of some of the forks are not smooth. It definitely is an inferior product, and for the price, I should have known better! Maybe now if something seems too good to be true, I will assume it is. DO NOT believe the 18/10 weight!!"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"2ND SET , ADDING TO SERVICE FOR 4 PRIOR, AND LOVE THE FEEL, THE WEIGHT, THE SIZE, THE CLEAN, SLEEK LOOK THAT IS EASY TO CLEAN AND HOLD. HAVE BEEN USING FOR 8+ YEARS NOW AND DEF WILL KEEP ADDING TO SET!"
2,Not what I thought it was,"Yes, it holds a Garmin. Not really the gadget that was expected. Barely able to ""stick"" it to the unit. Thought it would be better."
2,GPS bean bag Review,"Part was not exactly as I had expected. It does not secure my GPS securely. I will probably have to obtain a different type of mounting to secure my GPS to the dash. The picture online seem to indicate support on two side of the unit, but was not the case."
1,Totally dissatisfied,This product was a total waste of money for me. The pictures do not adequately portray the construction or use for this product. Don't waste your time or money on this product.
2,Garmin Bean Bag Mount for GPS,"I gave this product two stars instead of only one because I evidently misunderstood what I was ordering. I own a Nuvi 350 and this beanbag simply won't hold it in place. I change cars frequently and wanted a very portable mounting system to keep the GPS safe during use. I found that if I made a sudden stop, the Nuvi flew off the bag and clunked into the windshield. Save your money; do not buy this product if you want to use it with the Nuvi 350. Perhaps it's designed for use with some other Garmin GPS."
4,Good to have,Garmin Bean Bag Mount for GPS V (010-10195-00)This is not as sturdy or as easy to use as the windshield mount but it is easy to put up and down for short drives around town. This is important as with the rise of popularity of portable GPS systems they have become a favorite target of thieves. It is reported they look for not only the GPS itself but the tell-tale ring-smudge on the windshield. Then they break your window looking for the system somewhere in the inside of the car.
2,Not for GPSMap 76CSx!,"I went ahead and put the velcro strips on the back of my GPS unit and installed this in the car. It is just a holder now. I cannot see the screen. This is made for a triangular shaped GPS. The paper inside the box says it's for GPSII, GPSII Plus, GPS III, GPS III Pilot, GPS III Plus.If you have one of these I am sure you will love this mount."
5,Love it!,I really like the quality and color of this item. It was shipped fast and safely. I would buy again.
1,It would not play,I could not play the dvd. There is something wrong with it. I reviewed it before and the seller responded that he would only refund my money if I took back the bad review. I won't do that until my money is refunded!
2,Disappointing,"This book provides an interesting perspective on C.S. Lewis that you won't get in other books.However, I was disappointed by the writing style and the content of the book. It seems to be targeted towards a juvenile audience. Much of the book is simply a retelling of other Lewis biographies. There are many typographical errors. I was also surprised at the way Gresham constantly maligned others in Lewis' life.Another disappointing thing about the book is that only the last few chapters are dedicated to the time period that Gresham actually knew Lewis. He speaks with great authority on Lewis' entire life, interpreting events before he was born as if he was there.If you are expecting a well-written and enjoyable book about C.S. Lewis, this book is not for you. I found the book tiresome and hard to follow."
3,Not nearly the best biography on Lewis,"C. S. Lewis's step-son, Douglas Gresham, has now written a biography of Lewis which is intimate and personal, but not nearly the best biography on Lewis. Gresham presents Lewis with much warmth and obvious admiration, and I felt that Lewis's personal devotion to Christ shined through perhaps even better than in other biographies. But Gresham's writing style leaves much to be desired and the book is full of typos. More than that, Gresham's writing is marked by an over-abundance of pontification - an almost ""preachy"" tone, so that one feels like Gresham is talking down to his readers. So, the only reason I'd recommend this biography is to fill out a few details that may not be found in the other, better biographies. If you are only going to read one, get the one by George Sayer, called Jack."
2,Hmmmm,This book is written as if the reader is a child (Douglas Gresham is constantly defining terms he uses as he writes). I really wanted to like the book and find it helpful insight into the life of C.S. Lewis but it wasn't.
4,Best out of three,"Only recently (March 2003) did I take the opportunity to listen to Shostakovich's 10th.I've listened to this recording, a recording by Previn/London Philharmonic, and a live concert at Carnegie Hall with Jarvi/Cincinnati.Without question the Jansons recording of the 10th is the most enjoyable. It takes one a while to feel comfortable with this symphony because of some lack of structure and theme.But I agree with the review by ""kph37"" that this is an excellent recording. I can only rate it 4 stars since I've only heard three renditions.I must say that I now listen to the 10th FREQUENTLY. I enjoy it's energy and unpredictability"
3,"Good identifying key issues, patchy on solving them","This book has something to offer those searching to trust again in identifying factors that negate trust (i.e. fear). Lee does well at identifying what keeps us from trusting. However, he seems to offer abstract, cloud-like solutions for trusting that seems to be based on his personal experience in meditation and martial arts. He walks a slippery slope in bringing borderline religious verbage to describe the dynamics of trust. I wish I had an online version of the book to keep what seems appropriate and throw away the rest--however the book isn't all that expensive and does well at qualifying the factors that contribute to a lack of trust."
3,keys are flimsy,"I baught these knowing that the cables are shorter than expected. They add a little bit of protection to my computer monitors (on a movable arm system), computer, xbox 360s, etc. The items I do not plan to move. My only complaint was that the part of the key you use to turn is a very light and weak plastic. I ordered 4 cables and one of them was broken off inside during shipping"
3,great locka t great price only snugness is an issue,"i bought this for my new sony vaio but when i tried to use it for my laptop, it fit too loose but the lock is a strong lock though"
3,lock steel cable,"good for low price, watch out it's a short cable, won't be able to turn around a table."
2,You get what you pay for,"First the key broke. So I desperate tried to break the lock to get rid of it, and it broke too!!! What kind of security would it provide my laptop if I can break the lock with a jerk? Well I paid only $3 for it and got this piece of junk."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this for school and being a frugal person thought I was getting a deal. Unfortunately I was not, the cable though sturdy could not be unlocked from its initial position to allow for me to use it. The key would not release the cable. So I got what I paid for I guess. Addiitionally, the cable smells terrible, I just went and threw it away because it was giving off a terribly noxious odor that permeated through my apartment.Overall: DON'T BUY (at least not this product)"
3,Cheap,It was 55 cents plus shipping so I didn't expect much. the smell everyone complains about is easly removed with a quick wipe of the lock with a rag. I bought this to keep my room mate from stealing my laptop. Holds good lock is a little loose but isn't coming out and won't. only thing is that it's cheap but what do you expect. Nothing beats a Kennsington laptop lock though.
5,Solid security for the lowest price,"I bought several of these to secure a laptop, LCD projector and VCR to an AV cart. Well made, quality material, works great for what I needed. For high theft areas you may need a heavier cable, but for ordinary security this is perfect."
3,3 computer security locks,"they are great, cheap and work really well! the only problem with them is that they SMELL TERRIBLE"
2,Do not get this if you have a Mac,"I ordered this lock online, under the premise that it would fit my ibook G4, and it didn't. It seemed to work on my friend's PC laptop. Also the construction is no as good as other lock brands, but it looks like it will do the job."
3,Can't beat the price,"As others have mentioned, there is a strong smell about this. Not the sturdiest fit but I'm hoping for basic deterant in the event someone even thinks about picking up my laptop and heading off with it. I did try to air it some, helped a little. I see someone else said they used alcohol on the line, I may try that. I have to figure out what in my house I can loop it to and then lock...hard to complain for the price and free shipping. If you have more to spend, you may want to go with a full five star rating."
3,Ghastly chemical smell that won't go away,"It's also a bit short, but if you don't need something longer and can put up will the smell of the thing, it should work."
5,laptop lock works for college,this lock works perfect for my college dorm room. it can wrap around the leg of my desk and is long enough for it to go where i need it. and the lock is pretty strong.
3,Good enough to deter potential theft,"The cable is about 1/2 thickness of Kensington's. It may not provide the same cut resistance. However, the thin cable is very manageable than thick, stiff cable.The 3.5ft length limits the distance to a stationary object under a desk to wrap the cable around. I drove a large screw at the eye of the cable because the cable was short to wrap around. The screw may be able to be unscrewed by theft, but it is good enough to deter potential theft in my office. I recommend anything over 5ft cable to effectively wrap around desk leg or a secure hasp.One more thing, this lock does not provide selectable adhesive spacer to keep the lock snug to the object to be locked. Not a big deal considering the price."
2,Quality=Price,"Very poor quality, I wouldn't count on it to protect your computer. It didn't fit my HP notebook and then broke in my hands within ten minutes of opening. May be a waste of your five bucks (plus shipping)."
1,Wasted Money,I might has well have burned my money. Can't lock a Dell Inspiron 600m. Can't do anything that will keep the lock in the laptop. Any twist and out it comes. One star is one too many.
1,Unbearable stench,"These cables have such an overwhelming chemical stench that they give me a headache from several feet away. I even ran one through the dishwasher, it barely helped. I could use them if I wanted to lock a laptop outside perhaps?I called to return them, assuming it will be cheaper to toss them in the trash. The companies phone number does not work, the voice mailbox is full. Buyer beware."
1,Warning,Bought this product and the first time i used it it broke into about 15 pieces at the part the is suppose to lock into your computer. I will not buy again.
1,"this item does not work, frankly fraudulent","this laptop lock is so poorly made, it cannot be used. it did not fit into 2 laptops that i tried it on, and actually produced a metal splinter in my friend's thumb. this should not be sold on amazon. completely terrible."
3,smells like solvents,"works okay and the price was right, but whew what a disgusting smell, i've washed my hands 2 times and it still stinks."
1,Smells Like Death,"All I needed this lock for was as a simple deterrent for a classroom laptop, so it seemed like the perfect fit. Upon opening the package, however, I was overpowered by a strong, toxic smell. It literally stunk up my whole apartment. I left it on the balcony to air out for a day. I even washed it in the sink with sponge and soap. 3 days later, it still smells horrible and I'm considering just throwing it away. I think it might be a health hazard. Perhaps the smell is part of the deterrent factor (it's definitely stronger than the cable itself), but for me it's just not worth it."
2,Not worth $5,"This this did not fit in my 2010 iMac kensington lock slot. The main problem was the smell though. Its a very strong chemical smell. I know some plastics off-gas, but it was bad. I may have left it in the yard for a week to get rid of the smell, but no point, it didnt fit. Just printed my return label."
3,fine for what it's for,"Good for keeping on your laptop when you're at the library so you don't have to take your computer every time you get up. If you want real security, get something better."
4,Functional and A Good Value,"This is a good generic lock for notebook computers that costs less than five dollars, including shipping. It does have a petroleum solvent oder, so I wiped the entire lock with paper towel and left it in the airy garage for a few days. It is okay now.The diameter of the lock casing is about 3/4 inch. If you have one of those very thin notebook or netbook computers, you may have to buy one from Kensington that costs $30-40.Kensington 64343 MicroSaver DS Notebook Computer Lock with Keys (PC/Mac)Kensington MicroSaver DS Keyed Ultra-Thin Notebook LockFor normal thickness notebooks, this lock works fine and is very reasonably priced."
2,Not suitable for MacBook,"It looks weak, but would be ok if it would fit my MacBook Pro, as the product description said. I was really disappointed."
3,Its OK,Item does what it is suppose too - After modification... Item would not fit my Macbook Pro slot. Had to squeeze the ends together to fit. Once that was done item slides in and locks. As mentioned the length is a little short and the cable itself is a little thin compared to others available. At this price point what are you truly expecting.?.?.?
1,WARNING:you get what you pay for!,"I bought this product for my college bound daughter who has a laptop. When I opened the package, a small piece of the mechanism fell out. I then tried the key and the key became stuck and became inoperable.In essence, I threw money away for something that never worked.Save your pennies and purchase from a known manufacturer, like Kensington."
1,Worst product ever,"This product is absolutely the worst I've seen. It is poor in quality. The lock itself isn't sturdy. The key's jacket (the black part) nearly comes off when you attempt to take the key out of the lock. This item looks (and smells) as if it came from a small street vendor in China. It has a very strong chemical odor similar to the odor in China-made shoes. The product was probably intended for the Chinese market as it has Chinese characters in the back of the package. Take it from the other reviewers, this product is not worth your money. It also does not fit two of my laptops. I have an Acer netbook and Hp 6730b. So this cable is basically useless to me. Do not get fooled by the low price. This item is not worth it. Spend a little bit more and get a decent product for more money."
5,Lock it up!,"Ever since a student walked off with my classroom projector while I was off campus and had a sub, I lock everything up that I need. This works well. Keeps my laptop on my desk in class."
3,I'd rate it higher if...,"I'd probably have rated it higher if it had been what I received. Unfortunately, what I received was the cables with a combination lock. Those, I would give 5 stars, because they may not be expensive, but they're very well made."
1,Do not Buy,Bought this product and the first time i used it it broke into about 15 pieces at the part the is suppose to lock into your computer. I will not buy again.
1,Terrible just terrible,"The lock itself just crumbled the first time I tried to use it. It also broke the locking mechanism in my laptop ant now my laptop cannot be locked at all. I bought because it was cheap, now I know better."
2,"Cheap, short cable that smells bad",I ordered 17 of these cable locks for my company thinking I was getting a great deal. The cable itself was much thinner than other cable locks I've used. The lock itself felt loose and had a rubber gasket that didn't fit and fell out. But the worst thing is that these locks had a very strong chemical or machine oil type smell that made people in my office feel sick to their stomach. I wasn't willing to wash each of them off with solvent so I returned them.
2,This is not the product you're looking for,"We were looking for a basic lock to provide minor theft deterrent on a device. We went cheap because we were planning to install it once and not move it around.As others have said, the product comes covered in some type of oil - which has a very strong smell. After 2 days we were forced to remove the product and throw it away - it stank up the whole office."
5,Product is Perfect,"I have lots of tapes that I enjoy listening to, but my old cassette recorder was no longer working. I wasn't even sure I would be able to find another tape recorder, but happily, Amazon had exactly the cassette recorder I wanted and it was very reasonable."
5,a comprehensive and thorough guide to properties nationally,The level of information is extremely high for all parts of the country and gives great information on the specifics of individual properties. Reviewed it at an inn in New Heaven and sent away for it immediately. I compared entries to actual experiences and found it exquisitely accurate.
2,boring,"This album sounds like Oasis trying to cover Dead Meadow. Gone is the reverb ladden heavy gutairs. They are replaced by sparkly brit pop twang. And what happened to the vocal effects? Whereas Dead Meadow's previous albums rivaled the first two Blue Cheer albums, this album fails to transcend Black Sabbath during the Dio years. Buy the new Om album or the new Earth album instead."
5,Don't worry: Activation is easy and flexible.,"I wasn't planning to add a review here, but I do feel the need to clear up some misinformation. Adobe's standard license agreement does allow you to install on two computer systems simultaneously, provided that you're not using both at the same time. This is specifically to allow the scenario that several other people here have mentioned: using Photoshop on both a laptop and a desktop computer. You are permitted multiple activations to allow for this, and, if you do run out of activations, Adobe's customer service department will be quite reasonable in granting extensions. If you purchase software with activation and it causes problems, don't hesitate to let the company know so that they can fix it. But don't stay away from the software based on misinformed rumors about how activation works. If you'd rather not trust me or anyone else writing reviews here, contact Adobe and find out for yourself prior to purchasing."
1,Adobe Photoshop CS Upgrade,"My finger was on the button, ready to order this latest Adobe upgrade and then I read the reveiws. I bought Photoshop 4.0 and have upgraded at each step through Photoshop 7.0. Each of the CS reveiws either appologizes or complains about the registration and /or securiity traps that are now built into Photoshop CS. I have been there and done that with Microsoft XP Pro. This is where I part company with Adobe. I am not going to buy a product and have to beg the manufacturer for permission to use it. Adios Adobe"
1,Activation didn't work for me!,"I have read that Adobe will allow activation on two computers. However, when I tried to activate the software a second time on my laptop it wouldn't go through. My computer kept freezing up on me. I'm running Windows XP on my main machine as well as my laptop, so I wouldn't think there would be an issue. This proves that Adobe's activation process isn't as painless as they would like you to believe."
2,"""Picture Man 5"" needs a U.S. importer.","I'm awarding 2 stars on the strength of the negative reviews in this space and that Adobe has adopted the use of ""activation"".* I've been searching hard for an honest-gosh 48 bit graphics program, but Photoshop --even ""CS"", appears to be 24 bits with 48 bit features. I can get by with the basic 48 bit histogram editing capability of Photoshop-5, after which I convert to selected 24 bit content and switch to another brand (Jasc PSP-8 or Mgfx PPub in versions 3.1 and 8). It would be nice to be able to do it all in one program, however, converting to 24 bits at the end (if needed for the output).Check it out: Picture Man 5 from ""Stoik"" sounds great, but I don't want to risk my credit card or depend on an outfit in Moscow (Russia) for support. (My e-mail to them bounced.)Craig"
3,If you need help- ask a friend,"I purchased the upgrade specifically for the RAW import feature. After installation, I was not able to import files from my Nikon D70 camera (.nef files), although the website claims to support this camera.I could not find any help on the Adobe website, so I finally called support. The representive was not helpful (in fact rude) and wanted to charge me to get my program working as advertised.Make sure you have an expert friend before buying- Adobe will not help you."
2,"Great Product Enhancements, but Activation Required","This would be a fantastic upgrade if it weren't for the activation requirement. I work from several locations on three computers (including my mom's -- she has no clue how to use it), and I'd like to install the product on all three computers, including a laptop. Activation, of course, prevents this.Keep version 7 if you have it. The enhancements for the most part (except for text) won't be missed.I will say that Adobe's activation policy is many times better than Quark's, and they do have a good customer service team that might cut you some slack. This version is the best ever, but my advice is to just say no to activation."
1,Keep your existing version,"The one-star rating here reflects my answer to the question ""Should you pay the money to upgrade to this product if you have an earlier version of PhotoShop""?My answer is no, unless you need direct RAW support, which is about the only major feature that might worth the price. Otherwise, the new features are nothing really indispensible. (At first look, you probably won't notice ANY new features.)And then there is the Nazi-esque product activation scheme. Just say no to software that does this! It's a hassle and it is completely unnecessary. Consider the fact that ""cracked"" versions of PhotoShop CS appeared worldwide on P2P networks even before the product hit the shelves, and you've got a draconian activation scheme that only causes a lot of hassle for the honest people. All that money spent on development of a pain-in-the-butt scheme that was immediately cracked anyway. It's futile and pointless."
1,Faith Hill Video,I was looking for a Faith Hill music video this isn't a music video its just loads of people talking about Faith.....
1,Where's the Faith?,Oh Boy - This had to be one of the worst videos(if you want to even call it that) I have ever watched. I had to forward most of the video to get about 5 good minutes of Faith. A lot of unknowns talking about nonsense. This was really a bad video - Listen to the other reviews and wait for the Authorized Video. If you buy this you will know why this was UNAUTHORIZED!
1,READ THE REVIEWS,"I learned a valueable lesson about ordering from Amazon. ALWAYS read the reviews! This DVD is terrible. Everyone of the reviews are right on. No one had anything good to say about this product and I failed to check that BEFORE I ordered it. DO NOT buy this Faith Hill dvd, you'll be very disappionted!"
2,"Put a little faith in it, watch it sell","If your actually looking for background on Faith Hill, don't buy this. If you want to get a few minutes of Faith Hill in her early years, you'll get that. But what you'll also get is a lot of BS; a radio DJ and many extras who say nothing profound. In fact, you will be glad that this was only ten dollars. My recommendation is that you wait for an ""authorized version"" as this is not sanctioned by Faith Hill. Duped: I was. Thanks"
1,FAITHFULLY----NOT!!!!!!!!! NO KIDDING!!,I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WORST VIDEO. A ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR A RATING. HOW ABOUT NO STARS! IT'S OLD FOOTAGE BEFORE SHE EVEN GOT WITH TIM MCGRAW. THERE IS NO CONCERT FOOTAGE. JUST PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER. AND IT DOES NOT SHOW A WHOLE LOT OF HER. I RETURNED THIS AND GOT MY MONEY BACK. DON'T BOTHER. FOR GOD'S SAKE DONT BOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Faithfully Yours DVD,What a poor excuse for a DVD...not even worth the package it came in and the person I gave it to as a Birthday gift watched it and said it was horrible. I asked for it back and send then a gift certificate to Best Buy. I can't believe that I waited for this DVD. The content and quality are terrible. I will certainly question other items...and wish I has saved my receipt for a refund!
1,Faith Hill?,"what a total waste of money. Wish I had read the reviews before buying this so-called music DVD. The company who printed to cover, should be sued for misrepresentaion"
1,Faith Hills Faithfully yours VHS,"I am a big fan of Faith Hill.... There is noway she could have authorized such a horrible tape that had little to do with her. The sound was terrible and I find it offensive towards Faith. Especially when the title is Faithfully Yours, all about Faith Hill.. Let me tell you it's not."
1,No faith in this DVD!,"I was hoping to get here in time to save people from wasting their money, but by the looks of things, everyone else feels the same way that I do. First of all, don't expect any Faith Hill music. There is none! This DVD is 50 minutes long and if you take out everything that is non-Faith related, you could easily cut the time in half. It would appear that it was not even professionally made! If audio is as important to you as it is to me, this is another good reason NOT to buy it! The audio is CENTER CHANNEL ONLY!! What a waste! There was not a ""no star"" rating, so consider my 1 star a MINUS 1 star! Shame on any retailer that sells this DVD!"
2,"""Danny,do you have trouble reading?""","This is what Elizabeth asked Danny,a funny,fast-runner at school.This sent him into a rage,because if people know he cannot read they will think he is stupid.It turns out he has a condition..dyslexia."
5,Absolutely amazing!,I have tasted many similar garbanzo bean soups (including in my travels in Spain) and I found this Vigo mix to be superb and among the best! The instructions recommend drizzling some olive oil over the top and this was an excellent suggestion. I have found many dry soup mixes to be lacking in taste (too much or too little salt) but this mix was just perfect.
3,Picasso poster catalogue,The book came in a light weight cardboard box and was wrapped in a thin plastic. Presumably due to mishandling and the unusual snow we had recently the book was damaged. The cover was wet and bent at the corner. I was very disappointed. Beyond that the book is full of great posters by the master.
1,"Totally CHEAP, but not in a good way!","I thought this mask was horrible. Doesen't cover your face as it leaves your chin exposed. It is simlply a $15 dollar mask, you get what you pay for: Cheap plastic a band that says rental and lens prone to fogging up. If your looking for something cheap... this is it. My advice save your money and buy a better mask."
2,dont waste ur money,"dont waste ur money buying a cheap mask, this mask will fog up on u as soon as u breathe with it on, i bought it and after the first round i had to get one of the rentals, because i couldnt see nothing with it... soo just just save some extra money and buy a better mask"
4,One of my favorites...,"I enjoy Vicky Leandros' music very much. The lyrics often tell a story, and are not so typically romantic or of the traditional German style. The music itself is very moving and artistically done, and of course, Vicky's voice is beautiful. One of my favorite songs, ""Dann Kammst Du"" happens to be sung in French (Apres Toi)in this collection. Also, I'm not particularly fond of the English songs (5 of them including Love Me Tender, Separate Tables, Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart, Don't Break My Heart and LOVE). If I had to choose again, I'd select an album sung primarily in German, however, this collection does contain 33 songs! You're sure to find many to your liking. Some of my favorites include: Ich Liebe Das Leben, Tango D'Amour, Verlorenes Paradies, Ich Hab Die Liebe Gesehen, Die Bouzouki Klang, and Rot ist Die Liebe."
4,"Lots of fun, brace yourself for a learning curve","This game is not for everyone. If you need to play a game where you know what you are doing after playing it for a few hours, this might not be for you. If you enjoy a game that has a tremendous amount of depth, a steep learning curve, and a good AI this is worth it."
3,Just wait on buying this game,"This game is a slightly improved version of EU2. However the best part of EU2 was the user created mod packs (such as EEP and AGC which could be downloaded at the paradox forums). As these mod packs take quite a few months to take shape and EU3 is still pretty new, I would suggest any prospective buyer to wait until a year or so after the initial release to really be able to enjoy this game fully. Otherwise as the game stands it is only good for 2 or 3 lost weekends."
2,Not fun,"I was disappointed with this game. The graphics, while improved, really got in the way of gameplay. Also, the gameplay has changed to the point where I have to go through tedious tutorials to learn how to play. I figured it out, but there's just not engaging like the first two games were. Also, I highly recommend the game Victoria. While I think Paradox is a great game company, nobody's perfect. They have unfortunately fallen short with this one."
2,Europa III Not So Good,"This Game IS a bad one i must say, Its more like old school way with taking turns. Its a ok game when your bored but its very complex to play. You must play for hours to get the hang of it. The graphics aint bad."
1,FLOP,"What a let down, after installation I had to endure one game program problem after another.Game will not respond to commands.Game will not stay centered on my computer screen thus denying me access to some command selections.World view stayed blurry,and other visual problems.Yes my computer has been upgraded with all the max memory etc.All my other comp. games play well.I do not recommend purchasing this game !!!!"
4,Good game but terrible costumer service from the developer,I really like this game but the copy I got was not working properly. I contacted the developer and they told I needed an update to play the game. Why I was not informed when I bought the game in the first place? Good game but terrible costumer service.
1,this is b***s**t,"I've now been rooked for $30 on various websites claiming to sell this test. It's just an encyclopedia entry, about 100 words, describing the test. In fact, to save you money, here it is:The Kohs block test, or Kohs block design test, is a cognitive test for children or adults with a mental age between 3 and 19. It is mainly used to test persons with language or hearing handicaps but also given to disadvantaged and non-English-speaking children. The child is shown 17 cards with a variety of colored designs and asked to reproduce them using a set of colored blocks. Performance is based not just on the accuracy of the drawings but also on the examiner's observation of the child's behavior during the test, including such factors as attention level, self-criticism, and adaptive behavior (such as self-help, communication, and social skills). The Kohs block test is sometimes included in other tests, such as the Merrill-Palmer and Arthur Performance scales."
4,America's next top DVD boxset?,"Being a huge fan of the tv series, I was practically first in line at the store to buy this one. (I couldn't wait to have it shipped to my house.) It's great to watch your favorite episodes without the interruptions of commercials. So two thumbs up for that. I was a bit disappointed by the bonus features. The boxset's final disc (all nine episodes and bonus features are provided on three discs) shows merely a few moments of inital castings and how the girls were chosen. It also shows a few interviews with Jay Manuel (the make-up artist) and Jay Alexander (the runway coach). I was hoping for more footage of the girls' catfights and behind the scene footage of the judging sessions. All in all the first season on DVD is great but I hope UPN provides us with a bit more when the second season comes out."
5,the best season? oh yeah.,"Watching this made me angry all over again that Elyse was eliminated. She was obviously the best, but putting all that aside this show is so awesome. It's probably the stupidest concept ever but the show works. I love that it shows the true cattiness of girls and sometimes impossible demands of a slowly being choked to death on it's own vomit industry. Watch for Tyra's overdubbing throughout. Hilarious."
2,I'm really more interested in Cycle 5,"Cycle 5 is by far the most fun to watch...especially Jade! That whole season was about her. Too bad she was 2nd runner up. I'm going to have to wait for Cycles 2 - 4 to come out first. Hurry up and release these, so I can get Cycle 5."
2,Mediocre Reality Series,"As far as reality shows go, there have been better. I must admit ANTM is just as addicting as other reality series but just isn't as good. Lots of the drama exhibited during the episodes is obviously staged and the contestants just come off as ditzy and dumb. No one wants to spends 45 min of their time watching sickly thin girls complain about being fat anyways."
5,Good,This show is fun to watch because it gives you an inside look at how difficult it is to break into the modeling industry and the great lengths that people will go to in order to become a part of the fashion industry.
4,A great gift!,My friend loved this season and talked about it since our freshman year in college. It was a great birthday gift for her.
4,Nice little prism,"I bought this prism as sun catcher. Its right at 3 inches in length and about 1 3/4 inches at its widest point. Its a chunky piece with some weight. Glass is nice and clear and it refracts very well. Its has a prism crown on both sides so won't lay flat...its made to be hung. This chandelier pendant is pretty and sparkly and is well balanced for hanging and throws nice rainbows. The diagram is very specific about the number of bevels and its true to form. The one I have feels a little rough around the drill hole and one of the edges could have used a bit more grinding to make is smooth as glass as it were. Overall none of the minor imperfections will impact is intended use as a sun catcher, provided the the drill hole doesn't fracture. I would have given this 5 stars if it hadn't been for the minor imperfections nobody but me will notice while its hanging."
5,Great for brining in the light,"Wow, the sun just makes beautiful reflections all over the room! The price is great and they make great gifts!"
2,too salty,Convenient but too much sodium... 810 per serving. I'll go back to making it the old fashion way.....lots of stirring but worth it.
5,Very Good,This is a fine complement to any meal. Great flavor and easy to cook. If you like rice and even for one I know that hates rice! This is a fine meal!
1,not as i expected,"here is what my 7-year old son has to say about this toy: ""it didn't spin as i expected it. it spins too short. it's no match for the electronic dragoon g because this is too small. however if you play with dragoon v2 by itself and not against another beyblade, it's entertaining. the only cool thing that i like about this is that it stands straight. it is made in china and not japan as i initialy thought by looking at the ad."""
2,Hanes SL00 Silver t-shirts,"Ordered and was sent the three t's I selected - delivery was prompt, the t's were about $7.00 each. They are not generously cut and I'm afraid that a trip through the drier will make them one size smaller. Also, they are not soft and stretchy but rather stiff. I wasn't disappointed enough to return them but wouldn't order again."
5,The best,I've tried other shampoos on my daughter's hair and they only lasted momentarily. This shampoo does wonders and makes her hair last longer. GREAT product.
4,Wow! A Good Remix Album?! Really??,"I am a sucker for remix albums. I always buy them with great expectations. That remixers will somehow improve on my old favorites. They rarely do, of course, and I am usually left disappointed at the end. However, ""Meltdown"" is an exception to the rule. Filled with mostly excellent reworkings of Icehouse classics. Track 1 is worthy of repeated listening...just hit the repeat button and get swept away in the remixes moody musical landscape. The only real disappointing track is the remix for ""Hey Little Girl"", which is rather uninspired and dull, though not bad to listen to. Overall, an excellent effort though!"
1,"Meltdown, exactly what has happened here..........","Anybody who loves the real thing that Icehouse can do will be very disappointed with this mishmash of great songs that have been put through the dance beat mill and mixed to produce puremeltdown,no pun intended. Some of the songs are so heavily 'beat up' that they cannot be recognized as Icehouse songs.I hated it and cannot play it knowing how good the original songs are !I bought this in Paris because I desperately needed some Icehouse in my blood and totally missed my favourite albumGreat Southern Land, now gone but never forgotten.Buy only if you need the total collection or you like chucking money down the drain !"
1,Icehouse - Meltdown,"I am a huge Icehouse fan, but, whoever came up with the idea for this project and allowed it to happen should be executed. All of the great Icehouse songs have been so severely screwed up they are barely recognizable. It is a travesty of incredible magnitude."
4,Still refreshing after all these years,"I've had a copy of this book in my library since 1979. The fact that my original copy has all but disintegrated from use led me to recently purchase a collectable copy. This book is a unique, refreshing and strange pastiche of capsule reviews of influential science fiction works juxtaposed with its own engrossing future history told by way of the picture captions. And, oh, those pictures! This book is overflowing with the best and most glorious SF art of the early 1970s. They are the biggest single reason to buy the book, but the majority of the text stands the test of time. This book would make a great companion for anyone just beginning to explore the literary wonders of SF, as it was for me thirty years ago.My only caveat is that although some have recommended the book for young children (and believe me, they would love it), some of the text contains mature themes and sexual content."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Bigarse spaceships.That is what we want, or hugearse spaceships, even, and this is absolutely what this book gives you, in rather nice, artistic detail.As in, 'mum, where can I buy one of these babies'?Throw in some background and details, and you don't need to say any more about it, really."
1,Mixed approach mixed results,I had seen this book while shopping for the Terran Trade Authorities and Galactic Encounter books from my childhood. I vaguely remember this one from my childhood as well. So I brought it sight unseen.This book is two things. The main text is a history of science-fiction. The captions are written as a future-history narrative. The artwork is a grab-bag from the 60s-70s.The end result is rather jarring and not particularly satisfying. It would have been more effective if the author chose one route or the other rather than trying to combine both approaches.
2,Maybe something else,"It has very interesting content, yet it's repeditive. The writing is very assuming and it leads to speculation as to whether the content is true or just based on rumour. I think there are better books out there to buy if you are interested in the life of Dave."
2,The women's magazine version,"Reading this book is similiar to browsing through a women's magazine like Hello. For those who don't know anything about the life of Letterman it is in some ways informative but the writing is repetative and somtimes downright insulting to some people it referes to,for examble Lettermans girlfriend Regina."
3,"Good stories, terrible writing","If you want to know what Letterman is like offstage, this is a very good book that containsmany stories and little known facts, but thewriting is tabloid news level. It followsLetterman's career and personal life from whenhe was in high school to when he had The LateShow. 16 pages of photos.The writing is very blend, veryrepetitive both in contents and in format, andjust very boring in general, not unlikethis review. :)-- Ed Lee, Santa Barbara."
1,Nothing works for this film,"This is a really hard to watch movie. It has no redeeming qualities. Nothing works in this film. The best thing going for it is the length... only 89 minutes,"
1,Obviously needed cash,"I am a huge James Caan fan. I mean, I could watch the man do nothing but sit in a chair and stare at a wall and I would love it. However, there is no doubt in my mind he was facing starvation when he made this film. How else can you describe a man with his talents acting in something so despicable? Jimmy, if you're short on cash give me a call. Don't ever stoop this low again. The writing is uninteresting at best, the entire movie seems to have been overdubbed as no one's voice matches his mouth, and Christopher Lambert makes Sophia Coppola's turn on Godfather III look like an Oscar nominated performance. I'm still mad I wasted 90 minutes on this drivel. If you insist on watching this picture do it with the sound off, it's the only way you'll make it through it with your self-respect."
5,An absolute must for any writer,"This is the best thesaurus available. Not only does each entry have ample synonymes, but the words are accompanied by detailed information regarding the words etymology and common use. This is an absolute must have for any writer, be you a poet, novelist, or essayist."
4,Wise and Worthwhile,"I found this to be a wise and healing book. In many ways I think it is a 5 star book. It is full of beautiful images, great metaphors,fine humor, and a vast amount of emotional truth. Perhaps the emotional truths house the author's intent and purpose. The rats were great in this book!"
5,ANOTHER GEM,"You've read the basic story line of this book so I won't waste your time writing it again. I will simply say that Rivers is an author that writes for women. Men could never understand the emotion she put into her stories that ring so true to women. She will make us laugh and make uscry, make us cheer and make us groan..... and in the end we crave more.For me, her stories are never long enough and she can't write fast enough to rid me of this craving for her wonderful, heartwarming stories. Take a chance. Buy the book and get ready for a good old fashioned, well written story that will take you away from your world and float you off into the one she so generously created for you."
2,This was two books -- one good and one bad,"I've enjoyed other books by this author but I thought much of Fault Lines was a waste of time. It was as though she had ideas for two books and thought she could get away with combining them. The story line about her mother-in-law, daughter, husband and sister was warm, funny and moving (book one). But she interrupted the story with (book two) a melodramatic, romance-novel, Bridges-of-Madison-County interlude that inspired me to roll my eyes and flip pages until I could find a plot again. The only reason I bothered to finish the story was because I cared about the original characters. If you like romance novels, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't invest the time in it (or just skip the pages with the romance in it -- you won't miss much.)"
5,Better than pictured,"When I received these, months ago, I was so pleased at their appearance. The grey is rich and deep they look like you would have paid $100's for them. They are substantial but super light and comfortable."
3,Nice but busy,"These earrings are nicely made and sturdy for the price. However, just as stated in previous reviews I've read, the color of the pearls is very light. I also feel the earrings are a little too ""busy"" for lack of a better word; I would not have included the additional silver/beads on both the top and bottom of the pearl; overdone just a tad bit, but a nice pair of earrings nonetheless...especially for the price."
2,Color is not like the picture,The color of these earrings is very light gray not as dark as picture. Very disappointed.
2,mmmm,they are good but the real color looks nothing like the picture its a clear gray so if you want them because they are dark dont buy them
3,Doesn't topple Tokyo Gore Police,"Yoshiro wasn't amazing for his story with his other heroin-driven bloodfest, Tokyo Gore Police, but imo, twas def. less negatively-ridiculous; i.e. antlers, megazord, etc.) and more entertaining than this. I will admit Helldriver had a few scenes that were cool, namely the epic katana/m16 scene (no intention of spoiling) but overall, I don't think it was put together too well and although in awe at it's level of absurdity, I never felt twas too special a film. Something to go alongside the collection of Machine Girl and others, I suppose.Vampire Girl Vs Frankenstein Girl surpasses this by far, as does the triple director threat: Mutant Girls Squad."
2,If Yoko Ono made a zombie movie for Troma....,"This is a definitely a case of ""you either get it or you don't."" I didn't get it. Reviews on this film were so good, i figured it was a sure thing. But it made little sense from the start, with the narrative flopping back and forth for the sake of squirting blood and flying heads. It made no sense at all to me, even on a cartoon level. I'd say this is one for people with a special taste for squirting blood."
4,A wild ride,I found this film through searching movies at amazon.com it is one of the gonzo type films where the imagination has no limits. My opinion is if you like way out titles this is worth a look but be warned there is lots of gore though i don't think of this film as horror but as fantasy.
2,Interesting But Not good.,"I like Toyko Gore Police, and this is kinda like that. More insane ideas, just low budget as hell and the intro is so bad I almost turned it off. Just isnt as good. In the long run, dont buy rent if you can find it somewhere but dont waste your money on buying. Could have been 10 times better. I feel the director got lazy. Feels like it was on a budget of 10 dollars. Buy Toyko Gore Police instead."
4,zombie antler high?!,"Another Sushi Typhoon production, fun with over the top (and freakin crazy)special effects! I waited for this one to come out and wasn't disappointed, this film has so much craziness I couln't begin to scratch the surface! Zombies with antlers & people get high off of the antlers!!!who could even think this stuff up? All in all a fun film, up there with Meatball Machine & Samurai Princess as far as the special effects go.I'd recommend this to those cinephiles with a taste for this niche Japanese horromedy films."
4,Great gore,LOTS O BLOOD! Constant blood splatter fest. For fans of this theme you won't be disappointed. A little on the low budget side but well done anyway.
2,OK FOR A NEW PLAYER,IT IS AN OK HOPPER FOR FIRST TIME PLAYERS BUT THE PAINTBALLS GET STUCK AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT CAREFULLY MY ADVISE DON'T GET THIS HOPPER IF YOU ARE A FAST SHOOTER
5,ALLOWED TRANSFERRING ALL WORKS DATA TO WINDOWS 8,ALL MY MICROSOFT WORKS FILES WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED IN WINDOWS 8 ON MY NEW COMPUTER IF THIS OLD PROGRAM WERE NOT AVAILABLE
3,8.0 - 8.5 Microsoft Works,I bought the Microsoft Works as my calendar would not work on the works. Everything else works. I loaded it and it still didn't work. Took it to a computer whiz and he couldn't get it to load either. Don't know if Software is bad or what.
2,Microsoft Works 8.5,Not too happy with the software. There are some parts that do not perform. I have re-installed it and same thing.
4,software,This was a gift for my son. He said it's great. He's enjoying having it. The seller did a great job getting it to us quickly also. Thanks!
5,Microsoft Works 8.0 (old version),"Because I needed a data base for this computer, I wanted a program that was reliable and 8.0 filled the bill. I'm not sorry I purchased this version."
5,Just What I needed,I used it again the other day and everything is fine.I had deleted my old one by mistake and had to do a document.
4,Easy for transitioning,"I started using these for my daughter when she was about 18 months old. At that time they were a bit big (they start at size five). She is just about 2 now and they are fitting her better, but still big. I like them because I have the option of putting them on like a diaper or having her step into them. They are just as absorbent as regular diapers."
2,Pinched and not comfy for my daughter,My daughter had a rough time with these. They either pinched her and made her crabby or gaped and made her clothes wet. I don't recommend these. Save your money.
3,Give or take,This is one of those purchases where you can take it or leave it. They are more absorbent than regular training pants but get kids used to the idea of how big kid underwear goes on and off. In my opinion they are easiest to use as a diaper because they aren't as stretchy in the waist as training pants. I would recommend these for overnight use during the potty training stage because they are more absorbent than training pants and produce a lot fewer leaks and soak throughs.
2,bonito pero...,"tiene un buen diseño aunque un poco ancho lo que se evidencia aun mas por la correa plastica que lo cubre.Por cierto, luego de un año la correa plastica se ha empezado a despegar del metal, presumo por temperaturas altas (se ha inchado y despegado)con respecto a la iluminacion nocturna es muy pobre.espero les sea de utilidad mi comentarioel precio actual muy bueno yo pague $67 aprox."
5,"Lucid, logical, lovely!","I got half-way into this book before it was time to take my vacation in Italy. Would a (relatively) sane person take a finance book to Tuscany? Yes, if this is the book!It beautifully connects the dots on various key financial concepts, making them ACCESSABLE and USEFUL. Managing By The Numbers goes beyond good writing, which it has aplenty, to good thinking: it introduces a way to think about money that is as compelling as it is elegant.Thank you, dear authors, for dispelling the fog and, at least for this business owner, handing over some dandy tools."
2,I have seen worse much worse,I thought this movie was promising at first but it was a bit dissappointing. It is not the worst film I've seen though. The film kept you thinking there was much more to come. But it did not deliver. The Main charater I thought was lacking as he did not show any confidence even after he was taught by his master. Try other films before you buy this one. As a comprison it was better than Enter the 36th chamber of shoalin. But Buddhist fist and mystery of chess boxing were much better. This text refers to the DVD version of the film.
2,The Best part is Sadly the at the End,"This is not one of Joseph Kuo's Best Movies,Yet if you like chracters who are Funny(ALa Jackie Chan) then you'll like this Movie. 88 minutes of this movie is comical then Jack Long Enters and then the Acton begins.Pick it up it's worth having in your Collection Especially if you like Jack and Mark(Ghost Face Killer) Long"
4,"Very cool name, but I expected more","With a name like ""The 36 Deadly Styles"" and the accompanying box art, your mouth starts to water. Yet you will likely be somewhat disappointed. The fighting in the first and middle reels is good, but not great. I found myself fast-forwarding through most the film --- a bad sign. The plot is passable. Things get rockin' in the final reel and really rockin' in the last few minutes. Is that enough to buy the film? Add fan-favorite Jack Long to the mix, and you'll probably want this one."
5,Great kayak fishing instruction,"Dennis Spike's Kayak Fishing Video gives the entering kayakfisherman a valuable set of nuts and bolts to put together their own entry into the sport of kayak fishing. Great ""hands on"" demonstration and basic instruction of how to get out there and do it, especially in the surf."
5,Exciting Overview,"Never tried kayak fishing, but I'm now ready to go. Exceptionally well done and comprehensive. Great narrator! I also bought a book on kayak fishing, but seeing the ""real deal"" on video is much more stimulating."
1,Not as expected,"I am very disappointed in this DVD. I did not see anything in the advertisement that said it was salt water reel fishing only. I was specifically looking for a general DVD on flyfishing and kayaking.Naturally, I can't return it under Amazon policy. Shame on you Amazon for false advertising."
4,A real page turner,"This was the first book I've read from this author but I will be ordering more of his work. the characters are realistic, sometimes weak and unsure of themselves, but the plot moves quickly and keeps your interest. If you love mysteries, you must read this one. Or even if you don't usually buy mysteries, this one will fascinate you."
5,Another Great One!,"I have now completed all of his books and I'm looking forward to the his next. The Pardon was a quick read, easy to follow with not too many characters. He made his characters believable throughout his story. Couldn't put this one down."
5,I'm glad I chose James Grippando!,"I have a habit of choosing an author and reading their books from the beginning. Our library didn't have his first four books, so I bought them, I will read them and donate to the library. The first book was so captivating I had a hard time putting it down. Excellent writer!!"
3,Decent but not great,First half to 3/4 of book is interesting but author seemed to paint himself into a corner and the ending was pretty weakAll in all a good enjoyable easy read but not gripping to the end
5,"If I could give this a 5+, I would","I consider this to be one of the best novels I've ever read. This one had it all, (suspense, mystery, action, and drama). I was flipping through the pages wondering what would happen next. Talk about being ""on the edge of my seat"".I've read off of his novels, and in my opinion, one cannot go wrong with a Grippando novel. And I believe this one ranks up there with his best. Read it and see for yourself. It'll be worth every minute and penny invested."
5,Captivating,"I am not a mystery buff. I generally read non-fiction, and it takes a great novel to excite me. I especially liked the psychological component added into the suspenseful and complicated plot. It rivaled ""The Firm"" for enticing the reader's interest and attachment to the characters, and championing the humanistic outcome. I love books in which I can't predict the ending! Grippano was definitely ""gripping"" throughout the book."
4,Jack Swyteck Series,I thought it was an exciting book. Believe the Jack Swyteck is going to be a good series. Would buy next volume.
2,Too unbeliveable,"I know it is fiction, but come on, who would believe that a.) the Governor of a major State, would be traveling by himself and jogging by himself seemingly constantly and b,) someone charged with first degree capital murder would be let out on bail. Jeez. Those things had to happen for the story to progress, but it was such a stretch I kept thinking about. It ruined what might have been a good read."
2,12 year olds wouldn't be so stupid...,"I was really disenchanted from the beginning. Young children would be too intelligent to do some of the things Jack and his father Harry do in this novel.1. Jack goes into a former client's apartment2. with a gun and3. ends up prying open a window with a knife to get out,4. leaving his blood and5. the knife6. (complete with his fingerprints) in the apartment.Come on now. Though this is the least reasonable part of the plot I can immediately remember, these two are constantly doing the most outrageous things one can imagine. Did I mention Jack is a lawyer? No reason to think he'd know better. I finished it because I'm anal that way but I feel like I wasted 4 hours of my life.If you don't mind the book's heroes being total idiots (and apparently a lot of folks don't) then this one is for you but I'll NEVER buy another Grippando novel."
4,A good first book !!!!!!!,"Jack Swyteck is more like Mryon Boliter, authored by Harlen Coben. He despise his father and when he wants him to sign a warrant to stop the execution of his innocent client, his father paves him off as he is the governor and had promised the people that he will get rid of the criminals.Sometime later, Jack is accused of a murder and his father is threatened by a serial killer. Will Jack's father sign his deatj warrant. These are some of the questions that arises when you read the novel.The book is a good attempt at attorney-based novels. The plot is good and the characters are at ease. Jack Swyteck is good as a lead and shows the emotional content of a lawyer.Though, the book drags at some places, you can easily skip forward and get to the climax. Its worth a read."
5,A great book by a great guy,"I know the author personally; he was my senior english teacher. This is a great book by a great guy. The quotes and tidbits are funny and interesting. If you love baseball or just love reading quotes, I suggest this book!! Mr. Nathan you rock, even though you teach at St. John's now."
5,Mr. Nahan is the best by far,"This the best book ever. You must read it now. This is my English teacher in ninth grade, he is so cool. You must buy this book now."
2,I am a kid (my advice is what your children will most likely think about this book.,"OK book but it seemed that the only good short story in it was baseball in april. The rest of them seemed like gary soto put in less effort, still if you are Latino or you like seeing how the other side lives than you should get this book"
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book.The first page almost stopped me from reading. I was going crazy trying to figure out what ""fs"" meant. I found out on the second page and started the book over.I was looking forward to learning about the characters and understanding the choices they made and hearing their voices. They were not strongly written.I just could not get into Shepard's writing. It was like he was forcing himself to write from a teenage point of view. I agree there can be much manipulation among friends, however, I didn't click with the main character or understand all of his hidden anger and anxiety.I believe this is an incredible subject to write about; not one easy to put on paper. However, I feel there are other authors who tell this type of story better."
4,A topic that every school faces,"This topc is a must have for all parents and staff of a school community: adolescents who are NOT popular - and the serious ramifications of the social isolation from their peers and distracted parents is un-nerving.The story grips and is not a hard read.The emotions of these young men is captured by the author and it is heartwrenching - the hurt, anger and finally, rage - the lack of trust.School bullying and harrassment is a systemic issue that all sides must be aware of, look out for and respond to. Mr. Shepard does an excellent job of relating the adolescents view - and what can happen to the disenfranchised youth."
3,Problem with capital K's,"For some reason in this kindle book, all words that start with a ""K"" are capitalized. Like ""Kids"" and ""Know."" It's very distracting. I imagine that its a problem with scanning the physical novel. Can't amazon get a digital text from the publisher?"
1,I don't get it,The kid had a loving family. He had kids that would be friends with him if his one friend wouldn't of been such a creep to them. He didn't have to be so antisocial. He could of just been normal. I don't get why he would want to kill everyone. The other kid maybe. Not this kid. He's just an idiot. I didn't feel for either of the kids. I think they both chose their own fates by being antisocial. They most definitely could of changed.
1,"Tediuous, repetitive, and altogether poorly written","Sheppard's attempt to capture the ""American youth angst"" failed miserably. Instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through. I never developed any connection or understanding of the characters. Each chapter seemed to stumble into the next, with the end as predictable as the next expletive Sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge. You'd do better saving your money, driving to the nearest mall, and find the kid in the Anarchy T-shirt looking sullen, because it appears that is all Sheppard did in this work. Phew Stinker-rooney!"
1,Not deserving of an award...,"Anyone who works with today's youth will likely see that Shepard had a hard time connecting with the teen mind when he wrote this novel. The situations patchworked into the storyline to drive along the plot feel almost completely unbelievable. More so, the dialog used by the teens in this novel is so contrived and so incredibly awful. As you read, it feels like an adult desperately trying to write like a teenager but without have the background research of how one thinks.I can't help but think this book gets more credit than it deserves mainly for the fact that it tackles such an incredibly difficult subject matter."
4,Scar-ry!,"This little book is all kinds of scary: 1) Jim Shepard's effortless ability to crawl inside the head of a middle-school boy... second only to, 2) the jarring -- and awfully sad -- ending of Project X. I can't say for sure that humanizing a Columbine-esque tragedy (and extending the tragedy not only to the victims, but to those holding the guns as well) is an entirely admirable goal in writing a novel. But I can say that the book made me think, and then it think yet more; and perhaps coming away with a measure of discomfort is just the point."
3,Good read but very abrupt ending,"This was a very compelling read, that brought back uncomfortable memories of childhood. One can feel the despair and frustration of the characters, and their feeling of helplessness. My only complaint about the book is the very abrupt ending. I don't think its a spoiler to say that a Columbine-ish book is a story leading up to the big event..or not. The story gets to that final decision point...and then ends. All of three or four sentences are devoted to discussing what just happened."
3,Seeks to understand through fiction the Columbine school massacre,"Published in the wake of the Columbine school massacre, this book seeks to explore, through fiction, what could set in motion such events. I had no idea what to expect from this book, and was truly shocked by the ending, which might make his point: that we can't really anticipate what might trigger a Columbine-type shooting; those who say after-the-fact they would've recognized the warning signs, are fooling themselves."
2,for gen X,"I really tried to read this book. Restarted 2 0r 3 times, just couldn't keep my interest. In fact, it was so ""painful"" that I just stopped reading it. I am sure it has an audience, but, I think that it is very limited. Would not recommend for anyone over the age of gen x ers. Written in short sentences and chapters didnt fully fledge out the characters."
5,Horrible but completely realistic,"Constantly tormented by their peers, and getting little or no help from their parents and teachers, Edwin and Flick feel tortured and misunderstood. Their only friends each other, they are picked on, beaten up, bullied, and stolen from. Finally, in desperation, Flick comes up with a plan to take his father's guns to school and use them- and Edwin joins him.This book, although very mature (there is swearing on almost every page, and the subject matter itself isn't a light topic), grabs your attention immediately. It puts you into the minds of two students who decided to fight back in the only way they knew how, even if it cost them their future."
4,"Very well done, couldn't put it down","I picked up PROJECT X based on the subject matter and could not put it down. I've read books that attempt to approximate the real language of adolescents, but this one was seamless; the author is really talented to be able to do it so flawlessly. It was very accessible, at times funny and heartbreaking, and I really wanted to see what happened.Edwin's affection for his kid brother, and his ambivalence toward everything, was touching. So many times, he wanted to reach out, but this really shows the situation he was mired in. I read it all in one sitting and really enjoyed it. The only thing I wasn't sure I liked was the ending, but I could understand the point of it - I can live with it. To be able to pull this off, the author is clearly very talented. It was the first book of his I've read, but I'll check out the others."
3,Good but not great,"Project X is a look inside the world of an eighth grade boy, Edwin. Edwin is not accepted socially, and he and his best friend Flake decide to seek revenge on their tormentors.This book was a page-turner for me. I cared about the characters, and I wanted to see how it turned out. I think the author's style fit the subject matter perfectly. The language of the teens is accurate. The angst is spot on. The social situations are common.But ultimately I found the book unsatisfying. It did not really attempt to answer the big ""why"" questions that we ask in the wake of real-life school violence.I've read two other novels that deal with similar situations: Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult and His Mother's Son by Cai Emmons. I'd highly recommend either of them."
5,Ma Chevre,"""That means my goat in French."" As the narrator outright admits, The IHOP Papers has surprisingly little to do with IHOP and much more to do with being in love and in pain and not necessarily in that order. This book is also about being gay, being afraid of being gay, San Franciso, and goats, yes, goats most of all. Ali Liebegott has a true gift for creating witty, realistic, likeably imperfect characters. She is also an author who can find the absurd humor in even the most tragic of situations and make you laugh out loud even when you feel deep down like you should be crying. Reading this novel was an experience in the best of senses and the world will be a better place when Ali writes another.P.S. If you liked The IHOP Papers you owe it to yourself to read Ali Liebegott's The Beautifully Worthless, which is equally satisfying."
3,....,I enjoy reading but this book had no plot whatsoever. Don't buy this book. If you want to read it read it online or sample it first using Google Books.
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"If books came with a guarantee, I'd get my money back on this one. And I had really looked forward to reading it. I found it profound in many ways, but I totally couldn't relate to the angst or the characters.It was a chore for me to finish it. I realize it has won an award and it IS well written, but the main character was just too quirky and needy for me to relate to her. I'm glad some readers were able to laugh out loud, I felt sad in many ways, at the self-destructiveness, the isolation , the loneliness of the main character. And Irene left me cold as did most of the characters. May be I'm just too old for this type of fiction??"
5,A great read!,"Funny, dark and complex, this book was a very enjoyable read. I was lucky enough to get to see parts of it read aloud by the author, which I recommend, if you get the opportunity. Her deadpan delivery adds even further layers to the book's creepy humor."
1,illerate writer,"This man knows nothing about Islam or the fact Islam has been at war with El Quada for 170 years. El Quada is a Turkish Ottoman drug cult that seeks to destroy Islam because of Christ. Mohammid is the messanger, Christ our older brother is the teacher, Allah has 1000 names known by man, we are all brothers in the faith and no man is the leader only God/Allah etc."
1,Packaging stinks!,I Bought this set brand new I opened it and noticed my disc were scratched from the stupid cardboard They should of made this like the digipacks instead of slapping pics on cardboard and then gluing it together. I tore this case apart and trimmed it to fit in regulad DVD Cases. i hope Genius Produts don't mess up like this again.
1,LA INK,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS. ORDERED FOR A FRIEND SO REALLY CAN'T GIVE A FAIR REVIEW AS I CAN'T STAND THIS SHOW. HOWEVER MIAMI INK IS GREAT
4,Not really the whole Season 1,"The item I received did not have the same wording as the advertised cover. Instead of saying Season 1 at the top, it said Volume 1. I found that to be misleading, anyone purchasing this item should note it is not season one of LA INK but volume one of Season One."
3,amusing,For those who find themselves agonizingly bored... I strongly recomend...............Overall a great program with profound insight into the tattoo industry and the emotionality of it all......
1,Tacky! tacky! tacky!,"I received the Antique Brass Birdbath yesterday and, greatly disappointed, I am returning it.It's not an ""antique brass"" bowl; it's a metal plate that's been painted a brass color - and rather sloppily at that. It looks cheap. The paint will surely wear off with time and immersion in water. I wasn't expecting an antique, but I did expect a bowl that looked brass. ""Antique brass construction"" must mean they 'constructed' it to look 'brass.' But it doesn't.Once the cost of the support pole is added in, the birdbath will be far from a bargain. If I'd seen it in a retail setting, I would never have paid more than a third of the asking price. And to be honest, I doubt that I've have purchased it at all.Major disappointment. The bright spot is Amazon's easy return."
4,Great Book for PATRIOTS FANS,"This book will not have mass appeal. If you LOVE the patriots and care to understand the inner-workings of their organization, you will like this book.Michael Holley has all-access to an otherwise extremely tight-lipped organization. For curious Pats fans, this is a treat. It is very detailed thougH - surely to the point of boredom if you are not a Patriots fan.If you find yourself wondering why the Patriots let certain player leave, why they pass up on others in the draft, or why they have been so successful in a league that promotes ""parity"" at every turn... you will enjoy this inside account of how things work in a well-run football organization."
1,"A poorly written, shallow book on the Patriots","I have very little in the way of positive feedback on this book. I would say that there are a few insights here and there that are interesting.Otherwise, this book was subpar in every fashion. The writing was very, very poor. It was simple, contained some errors, and was frequently very confusing. The writer jumps back and forth in time and leaves out critical details that constantly distract. About 1/5 of the book is comprised of very dull descriptions of a few football games. Another 1/5 of the book is repeating many of the same things about Belichick that we already knew.The only people I can see enjoying this book are people who either know very little about football, or fans of the Patriots."
2,Lack of Depth and Lack of Structure,"As a longtime Patriots fan living outside of New England, I was hoping that this book would provide me with inside information that I was missing out on without the local media focus. It was inspiring reliving the first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis, but overall it was dissapointing. There were a lot of interesting specific antecdotes (most notably the Tom Jackson exchange), but nothing that really surprised me and no real in-depth analysis of their winning ways.The structure and grammar of the book are also quite poor. Although the book was short, it was not that easy to read as I had to continuously re-read passages to understand who the author was talking about or when the event was occuring."
4,Great book for the serious Patriot fan,"If you love the Patriots, tou should read this book. Very good insight into their system, and organization."
3,"Interesting, but left open.","I thought it was a good read and provided some insight into how and why teams draft well or poorly. It was especially enlightening when the key figures chose to ignore their own system and drafted players who looked good but proved to be busts. My key problem is that the book was a little dated and didn't really give any insight into Scott Pioli's failures in KC, or Bilichec's draft problems of late in New England."
1,Two years and this is it?,"Writer spends two years with the team yet offers about as much ""inside"" information as a guy who sells cars down the street at Rodmans. Obviously aimed at the masses, but a book like this has a much narrower audience and the authour fails miserably. Lazy writing, factual errors, you name it.Where's Michael Lewis - Moneyball when you need him? THERE was a book that was so in depth, so appealingly detailed it ATTRACTED the masses. Holley was a lazy hack with the Globe, he's a lazy hack here, and he's now a lazy hack on the radio.Somebody petition his editors for his notes so maybe we can learn some information we don't know besides Charlie Weis saying Patrick Pass can't play. Save the money, send me an email and I'll give you the book for free."
2,More Hyperbole Than Substance,"In purchasing Patriot Reign, I was hoping for a thoughtful insight into modern-day, post salary-cap NFL, a la Moneyball. All in all I found the book to lack in insight. The book provided more of a description of, rather than my sought after Belicheckian rationalizations for, the ingenious roster moves and overall management of the Patriots.Further, Patriot Reign was directed at a mass market audience, both in its writing style and its editing; the book jumped from thought to thought, and lacked Holley's regularly-displayed cogent thought process prominent in the author's Dale and Holley sports radio show."
5,Side of Belichick you never knew,"The book brought out a side of the coach you never knew about. All we see is the man on Sundays, on the sidelines. This book gets you up close and personal in the locker room, strategy meetings and players opinions. Also, interesting facts of his father's influence."
2,"Okay book, but are you using all these languages?","This book is okay, but is your development team really using all these languages? If you need to learn XML with a certain technology, get Professional PHP4 XML or Manning's new Java and XML book and many others. Not only do these books cover the same material as this one, they cover some really advanced topics such as architecture and design issues as well as giving you heads up on the latest versions such as php 4.3.0. This book also doesn't nearly tell you about all the potential problems that you can have with working with PHP where Professional PHP4 XML will answer just about every question you ever had plus everything else you didn't think of."
5,"Births, Deaths, and Marriages","In the UK this book was published as Births, Deaths and Marriages, a title I happen to like better than the rather bland ""A Death in the Family"". The American title seems to place too much emphasis on the murder, whereas the British title suggests that it is the overall situation that should be examined.I have to agree that this is not the book for the rank newcomer to the Hill/Lloyd saga but for those of us who have been following the ups and downs of DCI Hill and Lloyd and Their bedeviled police force, this is a good read.While the mystery is not all that impenetrable, the characters are well drawn-- I always find myself jolted by the realization that the British aren't Americans with funny accents-- and the plot, while ultimately relying on concidence, turns on the issues raised by the above mentioned births, deaths and marriages.Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
3,not the volume for new readers to start with,"anyone not familiar with this series should choose another title from it to start with.i guessed the killer just from reading the endpapers, which was a great disappointment. usually, the plots in this series are wonderfully twisty and unpredictable, without being psychologically impossible. still, there was some interest in discovering how the crime was committed.as with many other series, the point of reading each volume is not just the plot, its also the development of the characters' history.although i wasn't thrilled with this installment, i will definitely read the next volume."
5,Absolutely perfect,"I am a student nurse. This is the best investment I have ever made. Porter's Pocket Guide goes with me to clinical and answers my questions about drugs, lab values, ABGs, assessments and more. You'll love this book that really fits in your pocket!"
1,Has never been a help for my nursing needs on the job,"This was a poor purchase. As a nurse getting back into the field, I required a handy pocket-sized book to carry with me to have lab values and other valuable handy information at a moment's notice. This was not the help I looked to receive. The labs, nothing highly unusual, were not available here. Any other information presented was not worth a purchase price plus shipping. The cheaply bound spiral paper tore from the binding immediately. It is better to carry a small notepad and jot some needed information from a med-surg book and whatever needed info you can find on the 'Net. Conciseness was a priority, but this did not provide some basic info I require on the job."
1,NOT funny!,"I kept waiting for the funny stuff. It is really stupid. They attempt to do skits, that are not funny. It's dryer than British humor, yet there is no humor. The worst part of this is that the video quality is very very poor. Like it was recorded when computers first came out or something. Very pixelated! I should of took a hint by how the picture quality on the cover of the DVD looked. It is like that, but worse. I don't know what to do with this lousy DVD, can't return it, it's useless. I think I'm just gonna toss it. It is definately Not worth the buy no matter the price!"
5,I really like this book,"I initially got this book out of the town library and was subsequently glad to find a used/like new paperback version of it on Amazon for a very reasonable price. I'm an advanced amateur woodworker and I found the diagrahms easy to follow. I also liked that the author gave hints about ventilation, not using materials that would conduct heat into the houses, materials to use and the suggested thicknesses, cutting grooves into the inside front of the house so the babies have something to grab onto when they try to exit. If somebody else didn't like the book because the pages fell out, well, that's on the seller and not the book itself."
1,Ripped because of cheap shipping!!!,Today I went to my mailbox and found a bright orange plastic envelope from thrift books with this book in it. I open the envelope and see this book was at one time owned by a library and had stickers all over it which wasn't what made me give it a 1 star review. What made me give the 1 star review was that from the first page to page 14 was ripped out and just sitting in the book. I plan to return the item to thrift books for this reason I do not recommend buying books from thrift books unless things like these are listed in the product description. Despite that it looked like they're were some good designs in it and a variety of them.
1,birdhouses and feeders,"I have not received this book. I have received two of the three books I ordered. I ordered all the books at one time but was charged two separate shipping fees, I believe on my credit card."
4,"Nice-looking pad, and works with PC?","Looks pretty solid. Got all that you'd need, 4 action buttons, 4 shoulder buttons, start and slect, two analog sticks and a tried and true ""cross"" d-pad (not like the painful 4 slivers of plastic the stock PS1&2 pads have) It's got turbo as well and a mapping button, it's PC compatible so that is an added bonus. There aren't many solid PC gamepads out there, and so far the only way I knew of to get console quality but on your PC was the Lik-Sang ""Smart Joy"" adapter. Good work, Thrustmaster."
1,RunLog is only 24 weeks long,"I just thought I would warn others that are like me. I didn't realize it until months after I bought it, it's only 24 weeks long! This book doesn't work if you are looking for a full-year runners diary, which unfortunately I thought I was buying to begin with. Apparently not all runners logs are created equal. I thought I would be adventurous this year and buy a diary I hadn't bought before (I've owned all of them). Lesson learned ;)Happy trails."
3,Its a decent book,"This is a pretty decent book. However, for the most part it had nothing new or original to offer that I hadn't already seen in other animation books. Nice artwork thought and it's definitely pretty to look at so I guess in a way it's useful in providing inspirational material. But you're not really going to gain anything new by reading it."
2,UGH,It was ok as far as content. The info is too stinkin general for me. I would like alot more specifics in an informative book.
5,Leaking Pool,"I set this up for my granddaughter on a rainy day. We were indoors and what a mistake. While I was assembling the pool she couldn't wait to fill it with water. When the moment arrived to add the water, surprise -- it had a leak! What a mess! Now where can I get a replacement pool liner?"
5,Ivy queen is the best female raper,ivy queen is the best. I love her two cds En mi imperio and this one. I have never heard a girl to have such talent like la queen. She makes me move my hips with her music
2,Not dis Album! Sorry!!!,"Don't get this album, It's Dry! Da thing wiv reggaeton is its still in its early stages dats why deres only a few tunes dat sound HEAVY, like Guayando by Daddy Yankee, most of Mexicano 777, TNB, Tego Calderon...but Ivy Queen flopped on dis one! Demphra is way betta! BUT check out her new upcoming album Diva it's TIGHT bruv, I must say she's smack'd it wiv dat one especially 'subelo', finally Reggaeton is becoming respectable...BARE RATINGS Ivy Queen, even thou u flopped at da beginning u definitely turnin it around!!! Big up to all da guiales!"
2,Through confused eyes,The writer seems like a confused soul. He is restless to boot. He feels threatened by the western social system and its racial undertones yet feels attracted by its orderliness and economic prosperity. He comes back to Orissa in India only to be exasperated by its corruption and lack of order. But he is very appreciative of India's family and social mores. In the end he draws a picture of fraustration and confusion.
5,Good Times DVD Package,"I received this package not long ago and have looked at quite a few of the DVDs. They are of fine quality. I really like the header page where you can pick the episode you want to view or pick ""view all"" and they will play consecutively. There hasn't been a skip or jump in any of them. I would definitely purchase similar DVDs again. Also, on the outside of the packaging, there are the names of all the episodes in the series so you can pick one easily."
4,Great,"I think that this show is great, I'm turning 21 soon and I love it! I would give the series 5 stars because it's funny, entertaining and takes me back to a time when I wasn't even born! I give this particular set 4 stars mostly because of the packaging (the box the dvd's are stored in). All of the dvd's are stacked on top of one another with nothing to divide them which means you have to treat them very well in order to keep them safe and clean. The disc are stacked on top of one another and if you watch disc one, finish it and want to watch disc 5 then you have to remove disc 1 through 4 to get to five. The show is great if you like sit coms about African American families scratchin and survivin! Overall I am pleased with the set and would recommend it if you really love the show and want it at an affordable price."
5,"Good Times, Still Dyn-o-mite After All These Years","I was a bit worried about buying this complete series box set as I thought it might have dated but rest assured it is just as current today as it was back then, maybe even more so.The Evans family are warm wonderful people and it's that charm that makes this series a true winner.I loved this entire box and found the episodes carried some right on topics and it was a nice surprise seeing baby Janet Jackson as Penny.Jimmie Walker aside as J.J. I felt it was the entire cast that made this show from John Amos stern but strong father figure to spiritually strong Mom, Ester Rolle.There are some interesting cameos of future stars too from Carl Weathers (Rocky), Louis Gossett Jr (Enemy Mine) to past stars Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard (Our Gang aka The Little Rascals).Good Times is good entertainment that is funny but also hammers home strong messages about life too, so right on, buy it."
3,Goods Times or Good Memories?,"A great value package offering every episode of this show for a relatively low price. Impossible to complain about the value for money on offer. The only reason for the lower review is the show itself. My memories of the show were as a young child and looking back now it's not as funny as I remembered it. There is still a long way to go before I get to watch all the episodes - if I make it that far, so hopefully the later series mature a bit. It must have been cutting edge stuff for its day raising issues that previously may have been considered taboo. Interesting but not hilarious."
2,Dissapointed in packaging,"The packaging is total crap. Discs will be scratched in no time. If I could buy it again, I would buy each season individually. It might cost more but it would be worth it."
4,Good Times Complete Series Package,Excellent service - I waited in no time at all. I was surprised and very pleased to receive my package in such a short time from US.Thank you.
1,Poverty pack inside,I was very dissapointed in this package when I opened it up to pull out a very cheap plastic disc holder which contains all discs but nothing else not even a piece of paper with disc number and an eposode guide...nothing very cheaply done if I had of known I would not have bought it. I would have bought each season indavidually.Beware when buying this complete series all you get is the cardboard cover and disc's nothing else no packaging inside or anything.
5,"""GETTING UP THE RENT""","EXCELLENT SHOW I PURCHASED ALL OF THE SEASONS SEPERATELY. THE PACKAGING IS STURDY WITH LOTS OF VERY GLOSSY SCENE PICTURES. I FIRST BOUGHT THE SEASONS WITH JAMES AS I THOUGHT I WOULD NOT LIKE THE SHOW WITHOUT HIM. I BOUGHT THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ""PRETTY GOOD"" THEY MADE IT WORK WITHOUT JAMES. A FEW OF MY FAVORITESWAS WHEN JAMES BUY'S A GUN, THELMA DATING THE OLD MAN, JAMES FINDS A BAG OF MONEY, FLORIDA'S NEIGHBOR EAT'S DOG FOOD, THELMA'S WEDDING, WILONA CONFRONT'SPENNY'S ABUSIVE MOTHER."
5,Wife wanted this,She asked for this for Christmas and now she has our daughter hooked on it. So it was a hit!
5,Fabulous!,I love the slim packaging and the inside guide that comes with it. I could not have asked for more!
5,Good times w/GOOD TIMES!!,"Good Times is my all-time FAVORITE show. This collection is a must have for me. I got really tired of trying to find re-runs on TV, lol and didn't want to pay what it would have cost to purchase each season separately. These DVDs are high quality in both picture and sound. If you love this show, purchase this collection right away. You will NOT be disappointed!!!! The price and delivery time are DYN-O-MITE!!! (Sorry, I couldn't resist :D)"
4,Tiny,"I thought that this was a beautiful piece for my 10 yr old foster-daughter's baptism, and it is, but I need to learn to consult a ruler prior to purchase, as I'm terrible at visualizing dimensions. This is definitely more appropriate for a smaller child."
2,"Thought-provoking, but lacking accuracy at times","This book immediately caught my eye because of the clear printing and fascinating photographs taken about a century ago in and around U.S. schools (juxtaposed with modern photographs, in color, of school scenes). Unfortunately, the author was sloppy with facts. Specifically, the book states ""Thomas Edison invented electricity in 1879"". Aside from the fact that electricity is a natural phenomenon studied by Ben Franklin and many others a century earlier, the author does not correctly note that Edison invented the electric LIGHT bulb."
1,Inaccurate and overly brief,"This book is filled with inaccurate or misleading information. In the first 3 chapters alone I have found over 11 errors. It is clear that the author is not an expert on this subject and that the book was not edited or proofread by someone knowledgeable in the area of security. Additionally, the information given is anemic. Sometimes giving only a few sentences to important topics and failing to make points regarding information on the exam.I find it hard to believe that the author passed the CISSP test, and if she did, then that might speak to the reputation of the certification."
1,Is the author really CISSP?,"I come from the network engineering background with experience of 8 years, and i can safely say that the author doesn't know anything about networking beyond memorizing dry theoretical material without understanding it. In addition to errors and wrong descriptions relating to network security, the author omits enough information covered on the CISSP exam, for you to safely fail it. If you want a comprehensive CISSP book, get the CISSP PREP book."
2,Exam Cram? Don't you believe it ...,CISSP exam cram? Not by a mile. I was very disappointed at how it glossed over most topics and how simple the practice questions are in comparison with those on the exam. The book is a decent intro to ISS (the only reason I gave it two stars) but doesn't come close to preparing you for the exam. The sad thing is that it gives the reader a false sense of preparedness. Don't think that by correctly answering all of the practice exam questions you're ready for the real thing. If so you'll realize your out money thirty minutes into the test.
2,I hope she did better on the Exam...,"I know that Mandy has her CISSP but I certainly hope that this book is not indicative of the exam's content quality or requirements.There are numerous errors including giving incorrect solutions to sample questions - e.g. Question 44 in the sample exam:Attacks that are targeted at individuals and companies who have done something that the attacker doesn't like are known asa. Military and intelligence attacksb. Business attacksc. Grudge attacksd. ""Fun"" attacksIn the answer explanation d is given as the answer and ""...Answer c is incorrect because grudge attacks are targeted at individuals and companies who have done something the attacker doesn't like."" !?!?The InfoSec information described in the text is overly simplistic (with additional errors) and I give it a 2 star rating only as it may be of interest (value?) to school students looking for an introduction the topic (which isn't a bad thing as the subject is often omitted in existing computing curricula)."
2,Not a good choice as a study tool.,"In a word...disappointing. I purchased Exam Cram--CISSP after having been through a review of the ten domains and after reading three other books in preparartion for the CISSP test. I found the material to be fairly shallow (as compared to the level of knowledge required to take the CISSP test) and the review questions were extremely simple. This book is best suited for someone that is considering a CISSP certification and would like to learn a little more about what's required. As a study tool, this book is a bust."
3,Some chapters are worth reading,"Though lacking of details required for the CISSP exam, this book still has got a couple of chapters worth reading through. I perosnally will recommend the chapters on cryptography (chapter 6) and physical security (chapter 11). These 2 chapters do contain a lot of info needed for the exam. On the other hand, I find chapter 3 was not too informative, you definitely will not understand what a firewall and a proxy server is, just by reading this chapter if you are a newbie in this."
2,Too Limited and Basic,"I found the ""Exam Cram"" books work great for one hour tests (such as the CompTIA ones), but the CISSP exam covers so much material in so much detail, something this limited is not of much help in studying. I used this as my first study guide for the exam, and was able to breeze through it in a couple hours and score a 49/50 on the practice test at the end of the book (well technically 48/50, but there's an obvious error in the answer key!). The sample questions from other books and websites were much more detailed and tricky, and you'll need plenty of time reviewing those in order to have a shot at passing the exam. While I did find this well organized, nicely written, and technically correct, it ultimately is not worth the time spent reading. I found Mike Meyer's CISSP Passport offered a much better level of detail, and proved much more helpful in my studying."
2,"Weak material, no added value","As other review have stated, this book does little more than simply state the basic facets of the CBK. IT does not go into good detail and the practice questions are horribly simplistic. So much so that they add nothing and provide no measure of your preparedness, which is supposed to be the whole point of practice questions. Typically, the EXAM CRAM books have been good (at least for the MCSE they were), but this one was dissapointing at best. Buy the all-in-one study guide instead."
2,Little effort put into this book,"Practice questions are duplicative and not realistic. Several items are skimmed. Definitely not worth [it]. Coriolis' Exam Crams have lost my trust.I highly recommend 'The CISSP Prep Guide'...I recommend that Coriolis revise and come out with a realistic Exam Cram.I also recommend the CISSP 'All in one' It is truly an ""All in one""."
3,"Covers the topics, but...","This book covers topics in each of the ten domains of the CISSP KBA. The problem is that the text on each topic in many cases do not contain the important points about that topic with respect to security. In many cases the paragraph misses the important security point entirely. It's as if the author made an outline and then looked up the definition of each term or topic in the outline and then just typed in definitions without regard to security context. Many of the definitions are just plain wrong or contain very strange statements - obviously taken out of context from other documents.One good thing about the book is that it contains lists of study questions and their answers. Consider this book to be roadmap of the topics that you must study for the CISSP exam, but it is not a good source of information about the topics themselves. You will have to do additional research to get to what is important about each topic."
1,Waste of time and money,"The content and especially the questions are very low level. I refuse to believe this is representative of the actual exam. After reading it I can say I've learned a couple new acronyms but that's about it. This is my 1st book on the subject, hope the others are better."
5,train,nice looking addition to your train set. arrived quickly for the holiday gift giving season. husband liked it. that is all.
1,Bad idea,Using this is worse than using a regular pair of pointy scissors. It's too uncomfortable to operate. You're better off with a regular seam ripper.
5,F1 photography doesn't get any better than this,"Rainer Schlegelmilch has covered Grand Prix racing since the early sixties and probably now has one of the biggest photo archives on the sport available. What distinguishes him from many of his colleagues is that he has always striven to capture the passion and the human side of a sport that is by nature highly technical. The Monaco Grand Prix is the last true road race that is left in the current Grand Prix calendar and its location, history and flair give it an air and mystique like no other race in the world. Schlegelmilch captures past and present, triumph and tragedy that make up the story of this most famous race in Formula One. The quality of the printed photos is outstanding and the book has a good balance of black and white and color images. The accompanying 3-language captions are short but informative. The book also includes full race statistics of all races up to 1998."
1,Boring text!,No I didn't buy this book becourse of the boring text. Where are the emotions for a so emotionally place and racing!!! The photos are very nice.
3,Only photos,"Iy you like to read about MOnaco GP, this is not the book. If you wanna see great photos about Monaco GP, this is the book. There is one unforgivable flaw in this book: if it is a book about Monaco GP only, why the author didn't include absolutely nothing about the traditional Monaco F-3 Grand Prix also?"
2,How Could You Do That,I actually don't remember purchasing this item. I will have to do some research to see when it was purchased
3,Hypocrite,"One minute she's posing nude and later, later becomes Orthodox yetis severly impolite to so many on her radio program. Why can't she admit how dysfunctional she was and still is no doubt. Yet the content of her book is in the best tradition of good. Too bad she wrote it."
1,too bad it only goes down to 1 star,"I was given this book as a gag gift. I regret the day that I actually read it. Here's the basic message ""Be good."", it's nice that so many adults are willing to be maniuplated by a statement that has haunted them since Kindergarten. If you need a solution merely ""Being good"" is not a solution. Change something within yourself. Don't avoid the actual problem. And most of all DON'T preach about this book to other people, they might sucker-punch you, I know I would."
3,Plays better on radio.,"A 2007 Summer mini reviewI have been listening to Dr. Laura on and off for several years. I do not always agree with her stances or advice but more often than not I have. I listen to her on on and off, because I can not always stomach her crassness and bluntness. I decided to read her book and see if this would be a happier medium for us.What I found is that the majority of the book is based on transcripts of calls and correspondence from her radio program. While I expected this, I did not expect that those would be the best and most coherent parts of the book. I agree with the premise of her book stated clearly in the title. The overall impact of this message was greatly diminished by the disjointedness between the callers faxes and radio transcripts and her overall writing style. If this book is any indication, she has a better ""voice"" for radio."
3,OK,The book was common sense and OK. Have you heard her talk show? I used to like her but don't care to listen to her anymore. There is no need to be rude and hang up or put a caller down. There are better ways of handling things and she does not do well! Some of her values are fine yet others I do not agree with. She acts as if she is perfect and I am sure she has made several mistakes in her life! She is a waste of air time!
2,Laura talks better than she writes,"The best parts of this book are the the transcripts from the radio show. Why? Because when Dr. Schlessinger is behind the mike, she's focussed, clear, chatty, and intriguing. But her writing hits the page with a thud. There's simply no life in it.Her topic is an interesting one, but this book does not succeed in making its point. I would be hard-put to find a reader who enjoyed the book who didn't already listen her show AND was a rabid fan. I'm not discussing whether or not I agree with her position, but how she communicated it.I suspect that she's trying to write a book that has already been written, and she fails in comparison. Spend your money on M. Scott Peck's _People of the Lie_ instead, and listen to the Dr. Laura radio show for the same information. There really isn't anything in the book that she hasn't covered in the show.I read her first book as well and was also disappointed in how poorly the writing compares to her on-air style."
2,Will the Boomers ever go away?,"Once again a 'reformed' baby-boomer has stepped up to the mike to tell the rest of us she was wrong all along. Give me a break. I suppose it's OK for an entire generation to smoke, drink, and fornicate through their twenties and then blame their children for the state of society. Let us learn our own lessons, Doc. You had your chance."
5,Classic Dr. Laura,"She's witty, entertaining, and so full of good advice. And this book is right there. Even though it's almost a decade old, it sounds like the same old Dr. Laura. Don't shack up. Have some character. Do the right thing. I guess these are the types of things that should never go out of vogue. I was entertained, though you can get the gist of what she says here from her radio show. But then you get to skip the commercials here. I think if more people would only listen to the good doctor, perhaps they wouldn't screw them up so much."
4,COOL,"me,a diehard pokefan,love these!seviper,bieng my fav,looks cool along with treecko i reccomend these to ant poke fan!"
5,Simply THE best!,"I was 16 when this album was released and worked in a family owned record retail business. All in the shop grew to love this album and, through our continual playing of the LP in the shop, we were told by the wholesalers that we sold more copies than all other record shops in Northern Ireland put together!My poor wife will testify to the fact that I spent a lot of time during my honeymoon (a 'round the world' trip) trying to source the album (and others by ED&JFC;) without success. Imagine my surprise and elation when I saw that Amazon had got hold of it!The album was a classic of its time and that time, in my opinion, was the best time for good music. When balanced against other classic albums of that period such as Fleetwood Mac - Rumours, it is quite simply the best.If you like easy listening/west coast pop/country rock this is THE album for you. Buy it; you'll never regret it!"
2,Not happy with this blade,Coming from Bosch I expected this blade to be good to go right out of the box but was very disappointed. I actually bought this and one of the red coated Freud Combo blades at the same time. The Freud was sharper and cut 5 times better than this one did. Sent it out to be sharpened and it came back cutting a little better than when new but overall don't waste your money. The Freud is cheaper too. BTW I have owned a cabinet shop for 37 years.
5,Great Performance for the Price!,"I've used both Epson and HP's. Epson's high end printers do great photo's but are horrible with text, and HP's text is great but lacks photo quality. This is a great middle of the road printer. The speed is incredible w/4MB of onboard memory it takes the load of your computer. It automatically shuts itself off when not in use, and as soon as you hit Print it comes back online. For the price it easily out does Epson's or HP's in the same price range, Easy to set-up, out of the box ready to go in less than 15 min. Seperate ink tanks, only pay for what you use! Epson's new machines won't let you refill the cartridges or use any other brand but Epson print cartridges in them. Great color reproduction, doesn't soak the peice of paper with ink either. Would totally recommend for anybody, for the price."
1,"Skimpy Handful of ""Practice"" Problems","This solutions manual is really NOT A SOLUTIONS MANUAL AT ALL. It is a skimpy 100-page handful of 100 or so ""practice"" problems. BEWARE, this book does NOT have the solutions to all of the problems in the back of the ""Engineering Fluid Mechanics"" textbook (Crowe/Elger/Roberson 8th). Granted, the authors do show you, step by step, how to solve these few representative example problems. However, I don't believe that this little bit of extra help is worth the price tag. Don't waste your money on this POS (like I did)."
1,Listen to the first review!,Same thing as said prior. This does not have any solutions for the problems in the book. It only covers some sample problems and shows you how to do those. A measly 100 page book that is not worth the money. Dont make the same mistake I did.
1,Do not purchase this item!,This is not a student solutions manual at all. It is a book that contains a few additional example problems and solutions for each chapter in the text book. It is a complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT!
1,"Wrong question, wrong answers","This book is a bad attempt at resolving the famous nature vs nurture debate regarding some of the most intricate human behaviors. While the case studies presented and the molecular information might be well-documented, what the authors have ignored is that the genetic/environmental dichotomy is one that the unified work of biologists and philosophers of science have tried to do away with. I believe the questions posed in this book are the wrong ones, so the answers are inevitably misleading. You'd be better off reading Susan Oyama's The Ontogeny of Information."
1,Give some real facts or get off the pot,"There is not a single gene or group of genes or approximate loci of a chromosome that has been consistently demonstrated to influence human behavior. This is a simple fact. When you have discovered one and it stands up to any kind of scrutiny, let us know and come out with a real book. Study all the paramecium and little worms you want, but don't try to relate that to human nature. Human nature is not even remotely understood, yet we are trying to attach simplistic eugenic explanations to it. Let me offer the hypothesis that 0% of our behavior is related to any gene or group of genes. All you have to do is prove me wrong once. Good luck."
5,Kung Fu vs Yoga,An instant classic. Typically cheesy plot but funny and entertaining. Mind-bending yoga at the end of the movie. I recommend it to any fan of the genre.
4,This film freaked me out !!!!!,I found this film highly entertaining.I have never before seen the art of yoga used like that to deliver blows.Definately a unique film.
4,fun twist on Jenga like toy,"This toy is fun and very cute. It needs to be played on just the right surface or the based pieces slide around. Otherwise, this toy is worth the money."
4,Immitation sent.,"One of the sellers sent me an Immitation, it was not Cellet. Appears to be fine though, no issues yet."
5,A classic,This is a great book that provides a `how to' guide to create your own Lute. The pictures are easy to follow on the text is informative. For those with the skills well worth a look at - if you can find a copy these days!
2,Beautiful but Flawed,"No voice in music is as clear and distinctive as Melanie's. If you only know ""Brand New Key"" this album will amaze you. ""Leftover Wine"" is the most plaintive song I've ever heard and the price I paid is well-returned by this one track alone.I love the music but the disc is flawed. Amazon prints on demand and they screwed it up. From Track Ten on the audio skips and stutters. Until they solve their manufacturing process, I cannot recommend."
4,Beautiful People: The Greatest Hits of Melanie,This is an excellent CD. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed her music during my young adult life. I would highly recommend this album to Boomers and those who wish to get 'a dose' of good music from forty years ( ugh ) ago.
4,Beautiful People: The GreatestHits of Melanie,This is excellent music for my outdated generation! Melanie's music has a lot of depth.
5,However....,"I give this a 5 star rating for the 7 minute ""Lay Down"" and the beautifully remastered sound...HOWEVER....Where is ""BITTER BAD""???? :("
4,Melanie by Fripp? Well all right!,"Robert Fripp helped give the Roches their unique sound on their first and third releases. To put him in charge of a remastering of Melanie's work was plain brilliance. It's great to hear pristine versions of ""Ring the Living Bell,"" ""Brand New Key"" ---when and how can ""Gather Me"" be reissued?--- ""Together Alone,"" the live ""Physcotherapy"" (still fun), ""Ruby Tuesday"" (a fave) and ""Peace Will Come"" (I'm still waiting). ""Leftover Wine"" and ""Bobo's Party"" show how Melanie could rock with just her own guitar and voice. There are two problem tracks: The penny-whistles on ""The Good Book"" are mixed far too high and are abrasive; the mix for the eight-minute ""Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)"" is a mess. I mean a mess. Get yourself the vinyl release on ""The Four Sides of Melanie,"" it rocks."
3,"Please pass the munchies, we're back in the 60s!","I was a huge Melanie fan ""back in the day"" and was considering attending one of her live concerts but my wife and friends had never even heard of her! Bought this album to acquaint them with her music (and reaquaint myself) and was surprised to find that I didn't enjoy her music nearly as much as I had back in the 60s and 70s. Guess that our tastes really do change sometimes as we get older. However, there are a couple of songs here that I thoroughly enjoyed but I'll probably not be adding this album to iTunes and it will join hundreds of other CDs that I only listen to very sporadically. Bottom line: a decent enough grouping of her best stuff and probably a must have for any true Melanie fan but only okay recording quality. by the way, my wife and friends weren't enthralled with her music so we're not going to attend her concert."
2,Hi Ho The Derry Oh,"Melanie is one of those musicians who wasn't particularly popular even when she was popular, if you know what I mean.There were three magic moments for Melanie, and they are all here in fine remastered condition.""Lay Down (Candles In The Rain)"" is as captivating today as it was more than 30 years ago, vibrating between the soaring Edwin Hawkins Singers and the mumbling/shouting witch act Melanie never created again.""What Have They Done To My Song, Ma?"" was a quirky little thing, much like ""Those Were The Days,"" which came out about the same time.""Brand New Key,"" another novelty, but somehow sexy and catchy. I have a personal attachment to it, and the upper register parts are some of the best singing Melanie ever recorded.And then there's the rest of this CD. I suppose there are people who like this kind of wandering, meandering, clumsy songwriting--but I've never been one of them."
5,Incredible Voice,"I remember listening to a great rock station in Atlanta in the late '60s. It played several of her songs and I am still in love with that raspy voice that's so unique. I do recall one song that I don't see listed on any on these releases. She did a version of the Who's ""We're Not Going To Take It"" and I wish I could hear it again. Maybe it's under a different title. But anyway, her voice stands out among the rest of female vocalist. She's captured my heart."
4,GREAT RE-MASTERING......BUT!......,"""BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE"" IS THE ONE AVAILABLE CD OF MELANIE'S TO BUY,....BUT ONLY UNTIL A DEFINITIVE BOX-SET COMES ALONG! (I HOPE BUDDHA RECORDS IS LISTENING)...IT IS A TREAT TO HEAR HER SONGS FINALLY COME ALIVE THROUGH FRIPP'S GREAT RE-MASTERING....THE FULL 7 MINUTE VERSI0N OF ""LAY DOWN"" IS A REVELATION AND A JOY....AS IS ""RING THE LIVING BELL"". ULTIMATELY THOUGH, ""BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE"" IS A WELL-DONE, BUT MOSTLY REDUNDANT RE-DOING OF OTHER MELANIE'S ""GREATEST HITS"" CD'S...HOPEFULLY A ""BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE #2-GREATEST HITS"" IS IN THE WORKS! ...ONE THAT WOULD INCLUDE ""RAINBOW RACE"",""CYCLONE"",""RUNNING AFTER LOVE"",ETC...RE-ISSUING ""GATHER ME"" AND ""STONEGROUND WORDS"" IS ALSO LONG OVERDUE...MELANIE'S VOICE NEARLY RIVALED JANIS JOPLIN'S..WITHOUT THE DESPAIR AND THE SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS."
1,Too small and basic,"Despite the price, this book is tiny. It is only 41 pages and has an insultingly large typreace. This would be a great book for about $.... It is more like a children's coloring book.For anyone who has ever used audio software, bypass this book. The information is very basic. Opening a plug-in and playing with different parameters will provide more information and knowledge than is offered in this book. Quoted directly from page 21, ""If the bass isn't loud enough, boost the low frequencies."" Or from page 24, ""Compare your work with something that sounds great, and come as close as you can."" Thanks for the insight.This is a perfect example of he perils of buying a product via the internet. If I had seen the book in a retail store, I could have passed and found a book more suitable fo me.This may be a good introduction for someone who's never done any audio work but it doesn't justify a $... pricetag. It should be a low priced pocketbook, at best."
1,Missed the Target,"It's basic. No, I mean *really* basic. I'm not sure who the target audience for this book is. Maybe folks who might be mastering an audio project, but who don't know what the audio spectrum is, or how parametric equalization works, or exactly what a compressor is. To be fair, it does bill itself as ""Theabsolute beginners guide..."", but frankly I have a hard time understanding how anyone could get to the point where they have a CD to master without a better understanding of audio concepts than this book gives. I read the whole thing (48 pages) in one sitting, without straining, and did get a few tidbits that will help me, but in my opinion it largely missed the mark. The whole book might make a good basis for a chapter in an absolute beginner's guide to digital recording. I know Craig Anderton can do better than this.Wishing I'd bought something else..."
1,Where is the beef?,"This book from cover to cover is no more than what an introduction would be. I did not find anything in this book that taught me one thing beyond the most basic information there is. I find it insulting the author thinks he has offered something useful to the readers. I use it as a place mat, it is the most valuable use for it."
1,"Prof. Emritus, Religious Studies","One does not have to go too far to form an opinion of the scholastic value of this book. On p. xxii, footnote 5, the author gives the acronym for the Jewish Bible as Tanach (correct in English), but with wrong Hebrew letters: It is 'tav', not 'tet', for 'Torah'; and it is 'final chaf', not 'chet' for 'Ketuvim'."
4,Simmel: a German intellectual,"A good collection of Simmel's important essays, especially the parts from Philosophy of Money are useful, but it also carries the weaknesses of its original author. Whether you call it impressionistic sociology or whatever, it lacks explanatory vigour, and in so far as philosophical insight is concerned it is not good enough for a devoted philosopher. We know that Simmel's interests span a wide range of domains, and if this is a strength it is also a major source of weakness in his case."
5,Exceptional cutters,"Yes they're just cutters, but they make other cutters look like junk. I've had a pair now for a number of years, and they're still ridiculously sharp and cut everything I throw at them, from wire to zip ties."
1,Problems with HDMI with JVC HMDH5U,The HDMI on this unit would not work out of the box. Playback problems are frequent. The unit will shut off and restart after 20 seconds. I use it mainly for playback of recordings from the 169time processor. I have used the JVC 30000U and never had any problems. I have purchased two JVC 40000U units and neither one worked out of the box. Received error message 201.. calibrating. I called JVC and they told me to send the units to a service center.
4,A Great HD VCR!,"This is an awsome VCR.Should you buy one now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray is to be release?I say not! Yes the picture quality on a D-theater tape blows DVD away! I have ""Passion of The Christ"" On DVHS and the picture and sound is awsome,pure 1080i video.I been looking for some other titles and must are no longer availible.FOX still have some movies avalible on there website,but the thing is must of those movies will be on HD Disc real soon,and for those that are lucky will be able to watch 1080p,sorry my TV only goes up to 1080i,but I'm sure it will still look great.Well any way this JVC DVHS is a great VCR.It will tied me over untill HD DVD and Blu-Ray."
5,Surprised,"I bought this unit 2 months ago and at first was disappointed because as mentioned in the manual, the only way to record HD was through the I-Link input. My Direct-TV Sat system doesn't have one. I called JVC and they confirmed that so I thought I was up the creek. I then hooked up the component video from my HD Sat system to this recorder and played with it for a while and found out that in the HS (high speed) mode. It recorded HD without the I-Link connection and the picture is beautiful on my 65"" Mitts Diamond. What a nice surprise. I love my new D-VHS recorder and would buy it again. The tapes are hard to find and a little expensive at $10, but how can one put a price on beauty."
4,Yellow Wings,"Got your attention? This isn't about cowardly action, not with Flynn and MacMurray and Bellamy, but it does have those fantastic shots of pre-war naval planes with those yellow wings. For those who model the era this is a great movie. Video transfer is good and so is the sound. If you're into avaiation films you need to add this one to your collection."
4,Flynn! Curtiz! Airplanes! Technicolor!,"Who could ask for anything more? This film is a throwback to the great buddy films of yore. What it lacks in drama and intrigue, it more than makes up in in a good story that addresses flight surgeons and research -- not your usual pro-military propaganda film. As entertainment, it really does work. Flynn and McMurray head up a very good cast. Curtiz amazes me in the number of genres he handled so well. The aerial photography is brilliant -- Technicolor at its best!The other reviews here do a much better job of describing the film's content. I just want to add, if you like classic airplanes and a good story, watch this movie! It really is a good film."
4,"great story, fun to watch",This movie was such a fun watch. it tied in the history of airplanes in with great actors and a fun plot.this movie helped to show the real struggles that were taking place during this era. i would recommend that anyone who wants to learn about history and also watch a good movie buy this one!
3,A little balance?,"If this were a documentary it would deserve a 5. Not only are the (barely) pre-War airplanes the stars of the show, but the gorgeous color photography of the San Diego area in '40-'41 is well worth the price of the DVD. But... it's supposed to be a movie, with characters, plot and all that good stuff, and this one doesn't rise much above the soap opera level on that score. Even at the documentary level there were some rather heavy duty security restrictions in place - one is free to doubt that, contrary to what the characters say, dive attacks were being made from 50,000 feet! Still, watching all those Vindicator dive bombers and pilots, knowing the sad fate which lay in store for these very people at Midway a little over a year later, makes it a very special memorial."
3,Dive Bomber-the rest of the story,"This film is based on the work of a Navy flight surgeon, a Cdr. Poppen, who developed the first pneumatic anti-G garment for dive bomber pilots. Insofar as that's concerned the movie is accurate. However the other developments; a pressure suit for high altitude flight and a successful pressurized twin engined Lockheed type 10 aircraft were both done at Wright Field in Dayton, OH. Poppen's ""anti-G belt"" was not very good but was basically on the right track but overtaken by the development of better liquid and later compressed air filled suits ca. 1940."
3,Golden Wings are the Star,"""Dive Bomber"" has become somewhat of a cult film for aviation history buffs. The Hollywood quality color filming of Navy aircraft during the last days of golden wing schemes and some aircraft in pre-WWII gray make this DVD well worth it as a documentary. Now, if you are more inclined for film history and great past performances, I doubt thus will ever rate as a must see classic. Flynn's role as a dedicated Doctor with little other interest in wild adventure or women certainly makes an interesting footnote to casting, but otherwise, the aircraft have the most solid performance. That cigarettes play such a part in virtually every non-flying scene - no wonder these guys were passing out. Well worth it for aviation history but perhaps ""Citizen Lame"" for a classic film."
5,Just as expected,This wall plate was exactly what I wanted and expected. It's quality is high and I recommend it to everyone. I have used variations of all of these keystone jack wall plates.
5,Book Purchase Review,This book arrived quickly and was as described in the listing. I am very pleased with my purchase and would purchase from this seller again.
3,too short,"thought they would be full episodes, they we two or three short skits basically. Still, it was entertaining if you like Batman."
1,Low Grade,"Not what I expected. At a minimum, I the animation should move; this doesn't move. Everything is flat and the story surrounds the pictures; much like a power point."
1,Not worth it,"If you are a Batman and want to see an animated version of this story, watch the the ""Batman: the animated series"" version. The voice acting in that series is amazing. This ""Mad Love"" stop animation version is pretty low budget and the voice acting is terrible. Also, they don't give you much content per episode. Not even worth $.99."
2,Skip this one and get the BTAS version,I don't know why this was made when Batman: The Animated Series did an amazing job with this comic story already. It is word for word as the animated series version.As a big Batman fan I would say skip this and buy the animated series version. It is so much better with the Original voice talents and the animation is classic.
2,disappointing,"There were sharp edges on 'cut-off' labels of the gloves and the scarf was very thin. I wouldn't recommend the product. I bought white, and it's not actually white. It's off-white."
4,Good quality and price,"I purchased 2 of these sets for gifts at Christmas. When they arrived, I inspected them, and was very pleased with the quality. For the price, you sometimes are not sure of what your going to get, but these are top quality. Both receipents seemed very pleased with them, and they are also very functional, especially where I live in the snow."
1,Sizing info is misleading,"I have a big head have been searching for a hat/heatband that fits and looks good. I ordered the L/XL set, thinking I'll finally have warm ears but it's not to be. The head band is clearly marked OS (one size) and is too small. Even my normal skulled husband said he felt his brains squished when he tried it on. The gloves are great, they are sized. The prairie rose color is very pretty, exactly what I was looking for. Bummer. I'm returning the set."
2,"Good Story, But Narration Is HARD To Understand","I love most of the Rabbit Ears videos and use them often in my middle school classroom. I was excited to find this video, as we were studying African tales and I thought this would work well with the other ""How The. . . "" stories we had been studying. The music is great, the pictures are lovely, but Danny Glover's voice is almost impossible to understand. It's not the talented Glover's fault, the music or bass somehow overshadows his voice on the tape. At first, I thought it was my old VCR's fault, but no, I tried it on a new one with the same results. My students were really annoyed by the fact that they could not understand the narrator's words, so this video goes back on the shelf."
5,"Hear Me Tonight, ""This song is TIGHT!""","This song is really great! It is the first I have heard of them, and I was really blown away by this song. It's the type of song that will make you move when your in the club. Modjo sounds exactly like Stardust(""Music Sounds Better With U""). The lyrics are very catchy, easy to learn, and make you want to sing right along with them as you getcha groove on. It is one of those trax that as soon as you hear it, you will like it. The remixes are all good. I highly recommend checking this one out. If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
2,Don't buy product.,I used this product for about 1 week and I did not see any reduced in redness. When i applied the product my face became super dried. The price for the product is not worth it. Do not buy.
2,okay,"Evans oozes vanity and egomania. Men I admire like Mario Puzo and producer David Brown counted him a great friend, so he must not be as bad as I think. I know someone connected with one part of this book, who said that it's garbage the bit she knows about. So It makes me wonder how much else in this book is fabricated. But on its own terms, it's not a bad Hollywood read. But I'm not surprised to see that it's out of print (in book form), either."
4,Gotta Love Bob...,"He was kicked many times when he was down, at one point only a few of his loyalists remained, but he didn't skewer his fellow ""peers.""The guy is a survivor, a legend in his time, and perhaps in his own mind.His is a story about not giving up regardless of the hand you are dealt.The title is appripo....."
5,Best Biography I've Read,"A true Horatio Alger! Easily one of the most interesting books I've read. Even if your not interested in the genre of Movies & Entertainment. Evans spares nobody, including himself for how he made it, lost it and made it again. An inspirational book for anyone who enjoys biographies."
5,A Tycoon's odd lesson of life,"Bob Evans lived it all, saw it all, had them all and lost it all. This book is a strange life lesson from one of the most unique man you'll ever read about. Move aside Jackie Collins, Evans give us the real thing with a capital ""T"". The glamour of his life and the tragedy of his losses are funny and poignant at the same time. A must read!"
3,"A savage look at Hollywood and ""the industry""","This is a well-written stream-of-thought autobiography. However, his hip, Hollywood way of expressing himself was akin to being in a betting parlour listening in on a bookie's conversation, or a mob boss speaking. His life is one I would not want to be a part of with no rules, back-stabbers galore, people who don't keep their word and have no loyalties (for the most part). His life is a life that he seems to love, with all its highs and lows, women coming and going, nothing long-term and never wanting something lasting. He is a crass, mostly unfeeling individual who lives among sharks, and is one of them. It was a very telling book on the creeps that live in his world.......in my opinion."
5,the kid stays in the picture,"author writes in a fast-moving, highly entertaining, staccato, vulnerable, style, giving a broad and personal view of movie actors and moguls associated with the author."
4,Entertaining,"An inside look at a major player during the 70's, 80's, and 90's. You have to admire Robert Evans' chutzpah, and I think it was his egomania that got him back up each time he was down for the count. It's a delicious and dishy look at hollywood during a very exciting era. I can't say that the book will stay with you long after you've read it, but while you are reading it you won't be able to put it down."
4,the Education of the heart,"this book, the Education of the Heart, is translated in Chinese. When I read this book, I am enjoyed. it is not book than can read at once, but you could read it every time. In this book, the greatest man ask me what is the soul,and how to care of it. sometimes, I feel so tire that can't do anything, and by reading this book, I could gain the power for my life. Well, I like this book. I hope you like it too."
4,Trabajo interesante,"Como he comentado en otras oportunidades considero a Philip Glass como un extraordinario compositor. Sin embargo, siento que en sus trabajos de sountrack no termina de desarrollar buenas ideas en sus piezas.Este trabajo mantiene ese sin sabor... al menos a mi, al final de cada pieza siento que se hubiera podido desarrollar aun mas lo que comenzó.Sin embargo, en general, es un muy buen trabajo, que te lleva y con la sola música ya te habla de la película"
5,Another favorite Arch Book,"I grew up with Arch books, and have always loved them. So this review may be biased, but here goes anyway. This particular one, When God Laid Down the Law, is about Moses, and the Ten Commandments. On the cover it says, ""Learning Bible Stories is fun, with Arch books"". This is very true. They often rhyme, and this one is no exception. This older style Illustration, is the one I grew up with.These books are great for how they place a particular story into it's context. It takes the reader back, to remembering what God has done for his people before. It ends with how He will come again (in the New Testament), and die on the cross. In between, it gives the Ten Commandments in a fun way that is easily understandable."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"Please, if you are thinking of buying a beyblade like this one, STOP now! Beyblades are suppose to spin, these kind do not spin because of the weighted animal at the top. I did buy another kind like this, it sort of looks like an armadillo. The armadillo one spins faster than this one. My six-year old was upset when he saw that this one didn't spin. Please spare yourself the grief of having to listen to your child whinning!"
5,Johnny Crawford CD,This is a fantastic CD with many of Johnny Crawfords best songs. I listen to it all the time. Brings back so many memories from days gone by. I remember watching the Rifleman when Johnny sang Cindy's Birthday live on TV.
3,It's too difficult to decide!,"I agree with Dave, ""Missing person"".~When comparing my BEST OF cd with compilations such as THE VERY BEST OF, and ESSENTIALS V. 1, I find I have about 75% of the songs already. Which leads me back to reviewing the track lists for the individual 4 albums listed as Atlantic recordings. There are so many songs that I never tired of listening to because they DIDN'T get airplay. But I like more bang for my buck, so until I can find a boxed set of these 4 albums at a reasonable price,($30)(It's been done with James Taylor albums) or a special ""2fer"" offer, or a lower NEW price, I will just have to miss out on some really great music. I wonder if my turntable still works..."
2,Almost a good purchase.,"The fabric was a little thinner that thought it would be. Ladies need to wear an undershirt. The front looked fresh clean and new, but there was a round stain on the back. It wasn't damaged during shipping because the packaging was in good condition. The washer did not get out the stain but did lighten it. It's still wearable, but I was a bit disappointed. The shirt is cute, but poor quality control."
1,Terrible,"I had purchased a dvd from buynowlv as a gift for my sister, hoping it would reach her before her birthday. Not only did they not send it, but upon request ""resent"" the dvd. As the ""recent"" version of the dvd was the wrong product entirely, they have yet to correct this issue. Three months later still haven't received the correct product. I wouldn't trust this seller if they can't even send the right item the first time."
5,What Did You Do In The War Daddy?,"This movie was made in the 1960's, and I remembered seeing it then, and thought it was one of the funniest movies ever. I had always wanted to see it again, so I was elated to be able to get the video. When I watched it again it was as funny, if not more so then I remembered. Harry Morgan, is hysterical, and Dick Shawn and James Coburn are great. It is really, as they say, a laugh riot. It is well worth watching, and I reccomend it highly."
3,Did Somebody Order a Laugh Exorcist?,"This one-joke movie about the Italian Army's intestinal fortitude in engaging the war is tough going particularly when you consider the film's nearly two hour running time. It's certainly watchable but doesn't deliver the chuckles one would expect. It's nothing more than an extended episode of ""McHale's Navy"" with less laughs. I'd say ""Hogan's Heroes"" but that show was repugnant. Lone saving graces are a charming, not to say voluptuous, Giovanna Ralli and an all too brief turn by Carroll O'Connor as a gruff general. Mildly shocking when you consider the involvement of director Blake Edwards and screenwriter William Peter Blatty (""The Exorcist"")."
4,COMEDY SPOOF ON WW2 IN ITALY,THIS A COMEDY ON THE ARMY DURING WWII ABOUT A TOWN READY TO SURRENDER AND THE GERMAN'S WHO WANT THE TOWN BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN WANT TO PARTY. COL POTTER (HARRY MORGAN)FROM MASH IS ALSO MAJ POTTER IN THIS MOVIE.
1,what did you do during the war daddy?,I was unaware the video was coming from Belgium. It will not play on my DVD or Blue Ray players. The disc is worthless. It was supposed to be new but there was no seal on the disc case.
2,"For the Afternoon only, Not a whole War",This is an amusing time killer with James Coburn playing James Coburn. Great if you like that character. He is simply not trying too much here. This movie feels like its as long as the campaign in Italy. The comedy feels forced. I just cannot fully recomend this if you looking for a James Coburn movie. Dick Shawn is not up to his usual caliber either and the part with Henry Morgan (of Col. Potter fame from MASH TV) is wasted as is Carol O'Conner. Try and catch it on TV unless a Coburn fan.
4,Humor in WWII Sicily,"The gentle, absurdist comedy in this Blake Edwards film portraying American soldiers in Sicily during WWII prefigures in some ways his later ""Pink Panther"" series. One would have to be humorless to object to his stereotypes of the sultry local seductress, Italian troops more interested in village festivals, music, wine and women than fighting, and the evil Nazis who contrast to the bumbling but eventually victorious Americans. James Coburn plays the resourceful American sergeant and Harry Morgan, later Colonel Potter of M*A*S*H fame, his confused commanding officer lost in the catacombs of the small but festive village caught in the crossfire. A dialog-filled initial exposition, while crucial to understanding character, may be off-putting to viewers raised on more instant-action gratification."
3,COMIDY SPOOF ON WW2 IN ITALY,THIS A COMIDY ON THE ARMY DURING WWII ABOUT A TOWN READY TO SURRENDER AND THE GERMAN'S WHO WANT THE TOWN BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN WANT TO PARTY. COL POTTER FROM MASH IS ALSO MAJ POTTER IN THIS MOVIE.
1,Until now!,"I would really love to type something better about this product, but it is impossible. I have bought recently this DVD, but here in Brazil it isn't working (region 4). I don't know the codes to unlock my DVD Player and it has being impossible to find some information on the Internet. Could you help me?"
4,Thoughtful argument for both sides to consider,"Michael Lind, iconoclast in many fields, has written a fascinating book about the causes of the Vietnam War. Specifically, he asks why the war was fought and whether it was necessary. Although many of his specifics are questionable, his overriding thesis--that the war was an integral and necessary part of the Cold War, much like the Korean War--is difficult to question. While those who question the value of the Cold War as a whole may not be convinced, anyone trying to maintain that Vietnam is ""different"" from other foreign interventions needs to read this book."
1,For the love of God and all that is good in this world... don't... just don't.,"If you read this book you will never be able to get back those precious hours of your life. They will have been sucked away forever! The book strings together unsubstantiated political propaganda without regard for fact, detail, or evidence. The worst part is that it done without any attempt at the elegance or subtly of finely crafted propaganda. It is almost as if the author was being paid to create a book for a viewpoint he didn't agree with and couldn't even be bothered to make a convincing argument. The point trying to be conveyed could be done better by never opening the book, but rather beating disbelievers over the head with the closed hardcover text and refusing to abate until they agreed to reconsidered their more sensible beliefs."
4,Much Better than the Usual Sports-Erotica Compilation,"At first I was thinking to myself, ""yeah, yeah, this is going to be just another sports-erotica compilation"". Imagine my surprise when I sat down to read this book and discovered that no, it is much better than the usual sports-erotica compilation! I especially like the wrestling stuff.Greg Herren is a true man of letters."
4,allsport,"Slightly unfair review by the previous reviewer, when they say the book doesn't have all the great photos of the last 50 years. It is made fairly clear by the tag line of the book that it IS a collection of photos from the Allsport and Hulton-Getty. Anyway, for me, it was enlightening to see a lot of extraordinary photos that I had never seen before. I've already seen the really famous ones !!"
5,202 pages of superbly detailed black and white art,"The second of a project seven volume graphic novel ""Age of Bronze"" series by Eric Shanower, Sacrifice continues the story of Homer's Illiad with 202 pages of superbly detailed black and white art. This outstanding graphic novel makes this legendary Hellenic myth come alive in an impressive ""theatre of the mind"" experience for the reader. Enhanced with a full color dust jacket, color endsheets, maps, genealogical charts, bibliography, and pronunciation glossary, Sacrifice is enthusiastically recommended reading, and the ""Age of Bronze"" series an appropriate and welcome addition to any school or community library collection. Indeed, the only drawback is an impatient waiting for the next volume to see how this deftly crafted retelling of this fascinating story unfolds."
5,My favorite toy of all time.,"My owner's girlfriend gave me this caterpillar and it almost immediately became my favorite toy. I agree that it's colossal -- it's the only toy I have that's bigger than I am. It's also well-made, and has -- get this -- two different squeeky sounds: one when I bite the caterpillar's head and a different-sounding one when I bite its tail. When I bite the middle and shake my head violently from side to side, it's so much fun that I lose track of what the people around me are doing. Whatever it is, it can't be as much fun as biting and shaking a giant caterpillar!Written by: Othello, Age: 17 months."
5,BEST CD of 1999!,"Glad to see that Amazon is now carrying the latest release from this Aussie supergroup. Spiderbait take an AMAZING leap forward with this offering - they have melded the best elements of their songwriting ability, and ambitiously added some jam and folk music amdist the most solidly crafted power pop I have ever heard. Practically all of the songs hook you right away - a very 'up' CD, and everyone that has heard it (thanks to me) thinks it is awesome too. This will please fans of post-punk as well as today's alternative crowd, and I think if this CD gets promoted it would explode here in the US.Simply put, this is one export worth a try - one of the highest rated bands right now in Australia (take it from someone who lived there awhile), however not too 'commercial' like some Aussie exports over the past 10 years (eg Savage Garden, Silverchair). Enjoy!"
4,A Good Philosophical Exercise,"More intriguing and more encompassing but in the same line as her Cyborg work, this short text is an interesting philosophical exercise for thinking through the human relationship with dogs--and other 'Others' as well, as the title suggests. As a means of opening up the parameters for what constitutes 'Companion Species', Haraway thinks through our relationship with our dogs but insists on incorporating other species. It is a fun experiment that makes evident Haraway's true love for dogs, and her own dog especially. It is a bit self-indulgent and a little messy, but I like the messiness of it if not the former part. It is nevertheless an interesting read."
1,WASTE OF TIME,This book is the definition of pure dogscat. One star overrates this psychotic piece of pamphlet. I recommend watching the wind blow opposed to reading this nonsense.
4,Another Great Gift,"This was a gift for one individual, but everyone has learned and enjoyed its content. Very enriching!"
5,Out of the head and into the heart!,"I have read many books on energy, taken classes, been to healers, and done energy work myself. This book is amazing. It creates foundation and experience. If you are interested in being a healer or learning more about energy work, start here and make it a foundation in what ever sort of work you do. You won't find complicated techniques, ego, initiations, or celebrity endorsements. It is loving, gentle and perfectly directed from the heart and not the head. Thank you for a refreshing return to basic effective healing."
1,"Huxley (Patinkin) ain't ""Mine"" when I buy this CD",They left out the best song from the movie (Make it Mine by Mandy Patinkin)I want that song! mine! mine! Buaaaaaaahahaha
1,Terrible taste,"I saw reviews elsewhere that said these tasted good, unfortunately I do not feel that way at all! These are chalky tasting and just plain gross. If you want real chocolaty tasting calcium supplements get the Adora milk or dark chocolate disks (I purchased them at whole foods) - they taste exactly like chocolate!"
2,Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The performances are not the full performances disappointing!!!!!!!!!! Was expecting a DVD for the show not a highlight reel...for someone that was at the show its sad...
5,"Funny, sweet and true to life","This is a wonderful film. A refreshing, bright and approachable tale about how a young woman's life after college. It shows life from Sarabeth's point of view; she's not always right, she's sometimes annoying and she makes mistakes. But she is real.This is a great story that hasn't been seen before but still feels familiar. A gem! :)"
5,Great indie movie!,"What a gem of a flick!! Great characters (and actors!), dialogue, and NYC scenery. The story has spirit and appeal to young artists striking out on their own as well as serve as family film. The writer has plenty of heart - I'm glad a special story like this one, bubbling with original characters and insightful humor, made it to film. Looking forward to the next work from this writer."
4,Straight and true,"These are great replacement handles. I've had problems in the past with crooked handles, but these are great.Will purchase more in the future."
2,"Nicely made, but not a great toy","I got this because it was on sale, and I thought it would help my son learn to sort shapes. It is very nicely made, sturdy, and cute. But as far as helping him learn, it's worthless. Half the shapes fit into other holes than the one it is intended for. How does this help him really learn what goes where when he can just throw any shape in any hole? I guess it would be okay for babies who just want to put things in and take things out of boxes, but for a toddler teaching toy, it's pointless."
1,Not the greatest toy,"My 1-year-old daughter received this toy for her birthday and has hardly played with it at all. As a shape sorter, I'm not pleased with this toy. The lid easily comes off, making it very hard to actually put a shape in any side other than the top. It's also difficult to fit the shapes into its designated hole. When my daughter does play with this (she's 1 1/2 now) she usually just plays with the box. Also, the wood is coated with a shiny substance, which makes me nervous if she starts chewing on the pieces. I wouldn't recommend this toy. Personally, I think the best shape sorter toy is the classic red and blue one made by Tupperware."
2,Sturdy but lid comes of too easy,Very sturdy toy. Seems like it wasn't designed very well or something. The lid is also used as one of the holes to put one of the shapes in. Also some of the shapes are small enough to come out of other holes. Confusing? Yes.
3,No English subtitles Disc 3!!!!!!,Unfortunately I cannot give 4*s but only 3*s since Disc 3 is dysfunctional. I now have received two replacements from Amazon that still do not work. Very frustrated. Would love to see the end of this telenovella. I have become a telenovella junkie.
4,Good purchase,"I liked this series very much. I never saw it before, did not know anything about it but sounded intriguing. I was not disapointed. Sometimes there were some jumps in the sequence and had to imagine what happened in the story, but not too bad. I was pleased. The quality was also very good. A good purchase."
4,"Just the right size for a camera body, 1 lens, and small accessories","I purchased this for our office Canon DSLR. We have the body, one lens, a strap, a battery charger, and the cable for uploading images. Everything fit nice and neat in all the little pockets. One con: the dividers for the main compartment are a bit tricky to move around because of some very strong velcro. Once everything's in place, though, you're good to go!"
4,Very Nice Bag,"Excellent quality and finish , cool desing and the perfect size for a high zoom camera and his accesories.very nice materials and a unique colors ."
3,Camera Bag Review,"The bag is very attractive but just too small to hold my camera and two lenses. Perfect for a little digital camera but not the Canon Rebel. Should have purchased the bigger one, for sure."
4,"great bag, tight fit","This is a very nicely made camera bag. I like it because it is not so obviously a camera bag. It's has several ""pockets"" for storing small accessories. Overall, it's a good camera bag. My one complaint would be the size. I did not realize quite how small it would be. I had to remove all of the velcro-attached dividers in order to get my D3000 in with a lens on. Even then, I have to put the camera in with the lens pointing up. If I take the lens off and leave one divider in, I can get the camera in with some room leftover, but not enough room to put the lens in too. If you had a smaller camera, or were just looking to carry the body and a few small accessories, this is a great bag. It works for me, as I don't mind storing my camera with the lens on and ""backed in"" to the bag, but if you have a larger camera or need room for more stuff, maybe try one of their larger models."
2,Boring,"This book has extremely long chapters that are extremely boring. Summaries of long-winded legal historical documents would be welcome. If I was not required to have bought this for a class, I would not have."
2,A Police Report,"I was disappointed in this book. I have never been to the Adirondacks but have always wanted to visit. This book may have captured the surroundings but the people dont seem real. As a 20-year veteran of law enforcement I was expecting a good mystery. What I read was a story where there was too little mystery and far too much detail. It reads like a police report. Short choppy sentences and no mundane details left out. Who wants to read about every time he feeds his dog and a description of every meal he eats? One of the characters is kidnapped and held captive but there is never a motivation for the suspects' actions. Police reports contain facts but not feelings, emotions, opinions or conclusions. This reader was left without emotion at the conclusion of this book. How disappointing!"
4,Adirondack Detective,"Private Investigator Jason Black makes his appearance in this novel by John H. Briant. Although a work of fiction, the author has woven his own persona into his hero giving Jason real life image. Jason is retired from the NYSP and trying to live the carefree, good life of the mountains,but, it is necessary to supplement his meager retirement income working as a P.I. The author provides a wonderful portrayal of the beauty of the Adirondacks, while spinning the exciting adventures of Jason. A sit in front of the fireplace, feet on the coffee table, relaxing, enjoyable read. (Wayne E. Beyea, author of ""Fatal Impeachment."")"
3,More Adirondacks - Less Food,"I thought overall this was a pretty good book. I'm very familiar with the Adirondacks and, if anything, I think that Briant could have spent more of his descriptive ink on the Adirondacks than on his and his dog's food. I can visualize where he's talking about because I've been there but I wonder about someone who hasn't.The characters are fairly interesting. The story lines are adequate.I think overall that Briant has done a decent job. I've already ordered the second and third. Perhaps a few of the shortcomings I've noted have been improved?!?"
2,Ho Hum!,"I'm a bit familiar with the settings described, but there is very little ""mystery"" involved... but a lot of description of what he had for breakfast. The author seems fascinated by waitresses, too. And why doesn't he take his dog with him? The diagogue seems unreal, too... it reads like I would expect a police report to be! No name.. he might sic his law buddies on me!"
5,Great Insight,As a resident of the Adirondacks it is clear that the Author has great insight to the workings of the area and its people. He makes it very easy to relate to the times and the surroundings. A superb Murder Mystery.
4,Sage Advice,This book is like having an experienced gardener walk with you throughout the year. Advice on where and when to plant is combined with recipes and projects to make this a very useful book.
3,"Good idea, but like other books.","I like it, but I also got the similar idea from other book as well."
5,Get this book!,"After a few years of marriage I had run out of ideas to try and make things fresh and exciting between me and my wife. I got this book and WOW ... there are hundreds of ideas to keep me going for a long time. I am even combining some ideas and that works great too. I also learned much more about my wife than she had never revealed. When I asked her about some of the things that other wives had spoken of in this book she admitted that some of those things had been on her mind for a while but she didn't know how to talk to me about them without hurting my feelings or making me angry. Thank you Mr. Cronin for helping me. If you are a husband, get this and skim through it. Don't tell your wife you have it and try some of the ideas and see what she says about the new you. If you are a wife. get this for your husband or have someone else give it to him as a gift. Hopefully he will open it and make both of you happier."
4,Caught my Husbands Interest!,My Husband had this on his wish list so I got it for him for him for Christmas. So far it seems to have his interest.
5,Love the questions,"This is not your grandmother's activity/history book. It asks students to look deeper and challenges all of us to question our assumptions; disagree civilly and make a case for ourselves; and aim for objectivity overall. It also invites the reader to be a participant along with the authors, taking their own journey, as it were, to discover the truth. Best of all, it doesn't talk down to kids - it talks to them and with them. If you have kids, teach kids or know kids - I recommend this book."
5,Pure Prairie League -All in good time,Fans of country rock rejoice because this is your Disc! A must own to anyone whos been through the old eight tracks then scratched your old records only to go buy their music on CD! This band may sound better than ever and Craig Fuller and Curtis Wrights vocals shine through on every track. Its beyond me why this has not hit mainstream Country charts because its better than anything out there! A must add to your collection if you call yourself a country-rock fan.
5,Where has Craig Fuller been??,"If you miss Craig Fuller and/or Pure Prairie League, this CD is a must. Craig Fuller's talents are more than exceptional, and it has been way too long since we've heard from him."
2,Frankly disappointing,"Yes, I was a big Craig Fuller fan all through the 70's, from PPL through American Flyer and his great album with Eric Kaz. I was excited to find and buy this recently - Craig reunited with his old PPL buddies! - but the actual music is really disappointing, slick, stereotypical Nashville country. From songwriting to arrangements. Especially the songwriting. OK, and the arrangements. Blech. Bustin' Out it ain't.The only song I like is the only one that rebels a little against the formula, ""The Price of Doing Business"". Even it repeats the chorus once too often.On the other hand, Craig's voice hasn't changed a bit."
3,FUN,"This is a great set I guess I'll call it because it's not really a toy. Is fun because it has clothes for any time of the day. I boght one for my best friends birthday and she loved it- mainly because it has platform shoes ofr the one I boght did. It's really fun for girls 8 and under I would think because I'm just getting way to old for it I think""?"
3,barbie suv,"all that my daughter has been asking for. loves putting barbie in the suv and hitting the ""rough terrain"". glad to see a more duable toy like this for girls"
4,"Great ""Family"" Car!","I'm 13, I still play with Barbies *your not alone girls* I admit there definitly not as much fun as they use to be but they have there bright points, I bought this car for my little barbie family I created, it fits some of the smaller barbie's in back, like the kids, and to adults in the front, the little picnic in back is adorable, The one things that I'd change is the seat belts though, they get in the way."
3,"Cute Car, But..........",This car is cute but the only thing I have against it is that is very hard to put and take out the Barbie dolls. Other than that my daughter loves driving this toy around the house.
1,Neither Art nor Science,"It's a truly wonderful concept: How do the Arts and the Sciences relate? Unfortunately, Shlain gets it wrong. His Physics is so often incorrect, especially concerning Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, that his entire line of reasoning falls apart. And as for his claim that artists lead the vision of discovery (for example, it was artists who envisioned the concepts of Relativity such as in ""Nude Descending a Staircase""), he neglects the fact that Science is more methodical than Art. While a new style of painting is created and justified the first time an artist makes a piece, a new theory of physics is developed over a lifetime and must be rigorously justified. The questions and thoughts that gave rise to Relativity were created long before (it goes back to Galileo) the Cubist style of painting was invented."
3,Good historical review if you ignore the flaws,Having a good background in physics and not so in the arts I found the commentary on the artwork quite interesting without getting bogged down in nebulous descriptions of things. The physics is sometimes flawed and I found the whole attempt to connect art and science interesting but ultimately like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The book really doesn't address why this connection exists. Rather he focuses on how his interpretation of what an artist was doing preceded what his interpretation of what a scientific principle was illustrating. My friends and I saw just as many things that weren't similar. Ignore that and just enjoy the art history
4,An informative and interesting book,"When I decieded to write an essay comparing physics and art for my physics class last year, I bought this book. Although when I began reading it, I had no idea of what specific topics I wanted to discuss, after reading it, I had a clear idea. In short, ""Art and Physics"" is a comprehensive book that will convince you of the parallels between the seemingly different disciplines of art and physics."
2,Fuzzy Thinking,"I was hoping this book would be at the level of Louis Menand's ""The Metaphysical Club."" It's not. The core ideas grab the reader, but the writing is fuzzy and sometimes plain wrong. For example, on page 180-81 what begins as a fascinating insight into the ""primitive"" color words, black / white / red, quickly bogs down in error. Shlain claims that ""only in the most mature languages... does a separate word for the color blue make an appearance..."" Possibly technically correct, but conceptually wrong. ""Indigo"" has been around since at least Herodotus (450 BC.) I suspect Dr. Shlain is a delightful generalist who has written a book far beyond his knowledge."
1,Dissapointing and contrived,"It seems that a lot of the past reviews are duplicated and this has resulted in a star rating that is not representative of the general view.I am very interested in art and science (I am an artist who reads science) and I collect books that explore the meeting point between the two fields. This is by far the worst of the bunch.Shlain consistently miss-represents the facts and draws farcical comparisons that remind me of the kind of thinking that astrologers are prone to. This book goes down with the ""bible code"" and those interpretations of ancient predictions that only ever get deciphered after the thing that they are prediction happens.I wanted to finish it before writing a review but this would have been a waste of my time.""Art & Physics"" gives the art-science crossover a bad name and should be taken out of print."
3,Disappointing,"The author barely scratches the surface of what should be a fascinating topic. His knowledge of physics and art, as displayed in the book, are not even at an educated layman's level. Also, he simply does not make the connections between art and physics intuitive; at best they are coincidental and have no resonance. This book is okay for people with little experience with art or physics, but should be skipped by people with previous knowledge and experience of the fields."
4,"Worth the money, saved my back and feet.","Great product. They don't say it's two in a package so i ended up with twice as many as i needed. No matter, i'll use them somewhere or help out another with them.Stephen"
4,Turn your hard-earned dollars into art!,"Origami With Dollar Bills is a spiral bound book that will help you beat inflation by using the dollar bills in your wallet for something useful and decorative that will amaze your family and friends. If it had a few more designs, I would have added another star, but what the hey -- it's a cheap book and not a bad value at all.So, even though the dollar bills won't get you much at the gas pump or supermarket, it can now become a bunny rabbit, vampire bat, shark, dragon and more. There are 15 objets to fold in all.Now, that's getting your money's worth!"
3,Origami,"Not as good as I thought it would be. Too difficult for a beginner. Thought it would be a good gift for children, but more for adults."
3,"SOME GOOD, SOME BAD...A MIXED REVIEW","This is not what you would call a ""bad"" book, it is just one that did not live up to my expectations. The author gives us around 15 folding projects with a single dollar, a number of projects with multiple bills. I was looking for a book with only single bill folds. Some of the designs are cute, some not so cute. The directions are easy to follow though which is a plus and it is quite easy to teach the young ones the more simple folds. I must admit that the children were much more fascinated with this book than I was. The cost of the book though is reasonable and you probably will not be wasting your money in the purchase. Overall, an okay book, but I would have appreciated a bit more."
3,Middle of the road...,"As another reviewer noted, the spiral binding format is nice, but the models aren't very exciting. Instructions on many of the models are ambiguous to downright confusing, and could have been much clearer with just an extra sentence or two to explain how a particular fold is made.This book is far from the worst that I've seen, and I'll probably purchase other dollar bill origami publications from this author, but I wish he had an experienced origami folder editing his models for clarity."
2,save your money,"some of the designs looked really fun, however, after 2 hours and the brains of 2 college graduates, we gave up. not all of the diagrams are accurate. nor are all of the techniques explained. they will explain a simple technicue in the beginning of the book and then use an advanced variation of the same fold later on. they never tell you how to properly advance beyond the beginning fold. there are also terms/techniques not covered in the intro that are then used later on. leaving you trying to interpret the illustrations. overall, what i thought would be a fun way to dress up a simple gift left me with a headache and some terribly crumpled money."
1,Impossible diagrams!,This book would be fun except the diagrams are very unclear. I have spent upwards of two hours trying to figure out a fold based on a poorly drawn picture and an even poorer direction. Do not buy! You will give yourself a headache.
4,Dollar Bill fun,Not as many designs as I thought but very detailed and fun. Easy to understand instructions with pics and fun.
3,A necessary addition,I waited a long time for the price on this item to go down. It is not worth as much as it started out. All it has is 20 new animals and it also has a FEW new objects--not even any new foliage. Includes new jeeps and buildings and some of the same stuff as Endangered Species Expansion. When I got it I was satisfied with it. Most of the animals are very different from previous animals and have improved in looks (compare white rhino to black rhino). The variety is good. What I like best about this expansion is that it has allowed me to be able to choose from a wider variety of animals. Buy it if you want more animals; but don't expect too much more.
4,A peppy collection of first gay love stories!,"Wow, I've never seen this before: a collection of short films presented like MTV music videos (with two VJ-like hosts giving a humorous intro and outro to each one). The films -- six in all -- range from sexy to funny to jarring. My fave was Stanley, Beloved, from Hong Kong. I also liked Absolution of Anthony, which is about a boy who is obsessed with his priest, but who ultimately scores with the neighborhood basketball hunk. Oh, yes, and then there's Piglets, which should be required viewing at every gay party. What a hoot!"
3,"Some Plot, Some Not, all Vivid","I guess you don't need blazingly-clear resolutions to the plot, or happy or unhappy endings, to enjoy films today. Four of the six shorts here give just-enough resolution. A boy struggles against his sexuality by making heavy-breathing phone calls and ogling jocks, until.....A boy in Hong Kong covertly loves his friend, but he has to go abroad to school, so.....A boy overtly lusts with his friend, but then the friend's girlfriend comes over, and the three just go out together, and.....A gay guy brings his partner home to rejecting parents, and the two on the train back....aha. You'll see. For dessert, two of the six are a one-minute French farce-fooler, and a five-minute utterly wry, wacky, suave, cool German vignette of a family scene. If you can take less-than-neat endings, you can enjoy these."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Very disappointing! Not one of the short stories was enjoyable. I don't understand how people can call this art. ""The Absolution of Anthony"" was the best of the lot. ""Smear"" was stupid. ""Front Room"" billed as ""the two most erotic minutes ever filmed"" was not only not erotic at all but the biggest ""nothing"" I have ever seen. ""Fairy Tale"" was at least an attempt at some sort of a storey, but failed miserably at creating any sympathetic characters. ""Piglets"" was a nonsensical mess. ""Stanley beloved"" was just very poor."
2,Boys Briefs,I started with this DVD expecting something a lot different than the short films. Some of the short films are not even worth buying the DVD on any of this series.
1,Miserable,"What amazes me is that there was a demand for more Boys Briefs movies after this one. Every single ""brief"" was a complete failure. The first brief, The Absolution of Anthony (as if there was any absolution) featured a young Hispanic on the verge of coming out, who had a very odd ""hobby"" of calling random people out of the phone book and asking them to tell him that they wanted to *blank* him. It ended with what was a hint of an encounter with a (likely) heterosexual. The most ambitious, Fairy Tale, was miserably unbelievable. A guy goes home for his birthday bringing his partner of three and half years, and is so upset by his mother's coldness that he runs into the woods and has sex with a stranger. There's a terrible attempt at symbolism, with a red hat and a forest, and Little Red Riding Hood - it just doesn't work.I had very low expectations, but I thought that at least one would be good. I was very wrong."
5,An excellent tool for autodidacts,"If you're studying on your own, there's no better tool for learning Ancient Greek than this comprehensive and clear introduction. Unlike so many primers, it's full of interesting, real passages to read. It's truly a ""Complete Course""."
2,Too tough for me!,"Retired, wanting to pass a little time, I opted for Ancient Greek. No wish to earn my living by it, just for fun.I started with Peter Jones (very light-hearted), moved on to JACT (great), struggled with Betts (I have to agree against the Lunate sigma, hell, it's difficult enough without such complications) and have Mastronarde in reserve for a rainy day. But Betts is a bit too much me. I'll keep trying though. Promise!"
4,Kennel Fan,This fan works great and attaches to the kennel effortlessly. It is quiet and has helped us get a good night sleep without our dog whining because she is uncomfortable.
2,dog cage fan,This fan is small and without much power. It works fairly sufficiently to cool my pets cage however it is very noisy. My dog becomes restless from having it on and I have found a small desk fan works just as effectively without the loud buzzing sound. Save your money on this product.
5,"A modern, yet mystical, trip to Ireland","""What the Irish Goddess Told Me"" introduces a new novelist who has a terrific ear for warm, realistic dialogue and an eye for brilliantly describing the many wonders of the Ireland that she so obviously loves. Be prepared to become caught up in Michelle's quest to discover her Irish roots, wherever the journey leads, and to fall in love with, as I did,the people and landscape of Ireland."
4,Very funny,"Very funny. While the visual humor is frequently obvious, this is a movie you must also listen to to really appreciate."
2,2 1/2 stars for an art snob satire,"Sometimes even if you don't get what a filmmaker is trying to do, you like the result. And then sometimes you do get it, but don't like it. This film has half a dozen totally unlikeable characters, all narcissistic artists - is that redundant? The beautiful but way quirky gallery owner has one brother (Eion Bailey) whose art is very commercial but it keeps her financially flush. She doesn't like him or his art all that much, instead she likes the bizzarro artists of modern style. You know the type. Stick a cigarette on the wall, give it a name and call it art. Well the gallerist (Marley Shelton), does like the brother of her bread winner (Adam Goldberg) who's as nutso about his music as the guy sticking the ciggy on the wall is about art. I understand how this is a satire about art snobs, but I found the whole thing rather tedious if not odious."
5,One of the most underrated comedies I have ever seen ..For the intelligent person.,"I am not much a fan of comedies because I feel like people try to hard. But I am a fan of comedies with dysfunctional, weird characters or odd occurrences. This is a movie of people that are truly unhinged, odd , artistic in a amusing /entertaining in a interesting way. If you are not a intelligent person and don't catch on to dry humor ? Please do not waste your time on this you will be confused and bored. I love this movie I laughed until I couldn't laugh anymore this was so hilarious to me ! All of these people had terrible taste and bad judgment and they took there art and themselves way to seriously. If you like Punch drunk love, Or Very Bad things or Hard Candy ? This movie may be for you and in a genre you would like very much. The film is oddly entertaining with quirky characters and the cinematography is very well done."
4,Poke fun and be poignant...,"This film does not take itself or the art world seriously, but along the way helps question what is art, who determines what we value to be art, and why do we allow others to tell us what art is. Great acting and a humorous script make this independent gem a good time. You will not look at dead cows the same, nor question the music-making process after seeing this film."
1,use it for iPod mini not the nano,"The item was purchased for my husband's iPod nano, but we ended up using it for my older model iPod mini instead. It was extremely difficult to connect the iPod nano to the transmiitter properly. 5 stars for the mini, 1 star for the nano."
4,Works great for 2nd Generation Apple Ipod,This FM transmitter works very well with my 2nd generation Ipod. It gets 5 stars in that area but when I was trying to remove my Ipod one of the clips on the side broke off. It is a two part plastic unit. The ipod sits in the lower half and the top half snaps on over the ipod. Even though the clip that holds the top half on snapped off the transmitter still works fine and I use it all the time. You don't have to have the top half on for it to work. I love it.
3,"make sure your city has vacant frequencies, or it will suck","I bought this and got terrible reception. It's nearly unusable on my commute to work. A word to the wise, check this site before buying ANY transmitter type device for your ipod:http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/vacantIf it says no vacant frequencies, believe it.On the positive side, if I lived in a city with fewer radio stations, this is a well designed, useful device."
5,Podfreq Fm Transmitter,THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT EXCELLENT BEST ONE I'VED USED LOCKS ON RIGHT AWAY NO FADING IN AND OUT.
5,PodFreq + Anycom FIPO = bluetooth to FM carkit,"Get Anycom FIPO and you can stream your MP3s from any bluetooth enabled device to your car stereo.I have now noticed the following problem, there a high frequency din being produced along with the misic. I tried several stations with the same results. It is especially noticeable when the music volume is reduced.Ok, I now know what seems to be the problem, the firewire power input seemsto be picking up some interference. When I started powering from the mini-USB port the problem went away."
1,"NIrvana, where are you????","This much I'll say, at least Ryan Cabrerra can write his own songs and is a musician. But thats where the compliments end. Unless he was prevented by his label for some reason from releasing his better songs, then maybe that could excuse it. Stick to the underground, Fiona Apple, Nirvana, Corinna Fugate and accept no less! Nirvana, come back around, we need you, Kurt!"
1,talentless,"i went to highschool with this hack and he sucked then and he sucks even worse now. it would be nice if was thinking about something other than making money, o thats right sometimes music can actually be an expressive thing, as opposed to a money making gimic. this is a one hit wonder that should have never even had a hit much less a second album. how long before nobody even remembers his name?"
5,Awesome songs!,"I listened to this album on The Leak [...], so I knew it was an absolute great album then. But when I got the CD yesterday, and actually listened to it, I love everyone of the songs. It is a great great buy.My favorite song is Photo #5.Buy this album, it's great!Good job Ryan."
1,"Wow, sweet picture","What a cool pose. From a poser. how appropriate. where can I get the instructional video on ""how to be a tool""?"
5,"Once again, WONDERFUL ALBUM FROM RYAN!","Ryan Cabrera's new album, You Stand Watching, is without a doubt, one of the best albums I own!! Ryan's first album Take It All Away, which is also amazing! You Stand Watching's songs cling to you. Strong tracks are ""It's You"" ""With You Gone"" ""Last Night"" and the current single ""Shine On"" Trust me, you won't be disappointed with this cd! This is a must have!"
3,Disappointing,"I bought Ryan's first CD when it came out a few years ago, and absolutely loved it. So when I heard his new CD was coming out, I was really excited... that is, until I listened to it in it's entirety.His first single from ""You Stand Watching,"" 'Shine On', is upbeat with a catchy chorus that gets you hooked on it instantly. I really liked ""Photo"" and ""Last Night"", two more fast-paced songs, but after I had the CD for about a month, they kind of got old and the melodies weren't as addictive. And the rest of the songs seemed to be just filler.If you really want to get a sense of Ryan's talent, buy his first CD ""Take it All Away"", or download ""It's You,"" which in my opinion is the only song here really worth listening to for an extended period of time. Hopefully on Ryan's next CD, he'll branch out a little more and have more originality in his music."
4,Pleasant music to chill out,"I don't care if many think this music was made just for selling or if most 15 year old girls are mad about Ryan Cabrera, I think we wouldn't be fair if we criticied his work just for that. I bought this record because I loved ""true"" and ""on the way down"" from his previous album, and actually I don't regret it at all. Overall it's a serious record with no bad songs, maybe too mellow, but enjoyable after all.1-From the start (3/5)2- Hit me with your light (5/5) awesome beat. Should have been his second single3- Shine on (4.5/5) First single. Catchy but overplayed4- find your way (4/5)5- Photo (4.5/5) Second single. Nice, but doesn't reach track #26- Our Story (3/5)7- Fall baby fall (4.5/5) Sweet8- Last night (5/5) Impressive upbeat. Cool guitar riff9- Walking on water (2.5/5) weakest10- With you gone (4.5/5) Getting better11- It's you (5/5) Ending with his best written song. Slow, beautiful...This is a certain future single. Leaves a great taste"
1,Not Very Impressed,"I was really excited when I heard Ryan was coming out with a new CD. I fell in love with his debut. I thought every single song was amazing. So I got You Stand Watching.....this cd is really not worth the money. The only songs worth mentioning are ""Shine On"", ""Photo"" and ""Fall Baby Fall"". The others are very boring and you will find yourself skipping over them after 30 seconds. Ryan proved with his debut he could sing and make very entertaining music. Why he failed to do it this time around is beyond my reasoning."
4,I'd give him some credit,"I am 15 years old right now and I bought this CD like within a week right after it came out. I loved the seeing the music video to ""Shine On"" and loved it on the radio. I didnt think the song was alright before, but the song started to get stuck in my head. So Im like, ""I gotta get the CD!"". So I went ahead and bought it. Even though there were a few songs I loved the most that is why I rate this a 4 stars and not a 3. Because of the song ""Find Your Way"" and ""From the start"". Those are my two favorite songs and those songs are why it made 4 stars on my vote. The other songs arent really that good but ""Shine On"" and ""Fall baby fall"" are okay.I wont say I love this CD he could have done better but he is a talented singer. But I prefer you guys buy the songs on iTunes or Napster or something. Anyway 4 stars becuz hes cool and stuff...I suggest everyone listen to ""Find Your Way"" ITS SOOOOO AMAZING. ~tony, 15, maryand."
3,60s text book fun,"The first third of the book is devoted to design principles and history of fashion. The rest is technique, with slopers. Many many b+w illustration, mainly line drawings. I like the sections where good and poor designs are compared side by side, especially the chapter ""elements of good taste.""For someone with an iterest in sewing or collecting 60s fashion, this is an enjoyable find."
5,Swarvoski Crystal earrings,"Very Beautiful, reflective. Looka great deal more expensive than theywere."
5,sparkle,I love the sparkle of these earrings. The crystal is very good at picking up colors that are nearby and reflecting it into ever-changing glitter. They go with everything and stay put thanks to the leverback. You can't beat the price either. Definitely a great gift idea. Amy
5,Sparkly!,These match a pendant I have and are very pretty. They catch the light in many different ways.
3,earrings,The process time for the order for these earrings was great- received them within 4 days. I was rather disappointed by the color- it was not as pictured and did not go with the other pieces I ordered to wear with them. They actually are yellow.
4,Great value,These swarovski earrings are very pretty and sparkle with color in the light. I like the lever backs. A great value for the price.
2,Thin crystal,"Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin! I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial. They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice. The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint. Not what I expected."
4,nice!!,the earrings are nice. perfect if you like a little bling but not too much attention. it looks classic and you could wear them from day to night. i hope they last because i just got them :) the real thing does not have the blue sparkle that the picture has.
2,cheap,"Light weight, very cheap. I was underwhelmed. They are NOT sterling silver, only plated. Have already started to bother my ears. Never buying earrings from Amazon again."
3,bit larger than we expected,"These earrings were a bit larger than we expected. They look just like the picture with a nice depth to the strong, clear color. This item is a gift that the recipient wills definitely be able to wear everyday."
2,Disappointing.,"I have some genuine Swarovski earrings that a friend who is a jewelry maker gave to me. These look like glass in comparison. They do not pick up or reflect any colors whatsoever. The facets all line up, but they are definitely NOT the real thing."
2,disillusioned,I was mislead by the Swarovski name these are not Swarovski standard. I also planned on giving them as a gift but have decided I would be embarrassed to do so.The earring actually fell apart when I removed it from the bag.
5,Gorgeous earrings.,These go perfectly together with the matching pendant I previously reviewed. These things sparkle so brilliantly when the light hits them. I can't wait to buy several more pairs of these in different colours so my girlfriend can glow everyday.I am now officially a fan of Swarovski crystal.
3,Good!!!,"The packing was nice, the earings were nice too, except they look more yellowish than the blue as in the picture, but all-in-all its a good buy."
5,I feel so pretty....!,"Very cute earrings, great price, and I always feel a little more ""dressed up"" when I wear them. Love them!"
5,WOW - I'm blind by the Sparkle,"These earrings are so beautiful. When I opened the box, the sparkle jumped out to me. I literally said ""OH YES!!!!"" I work in a uniform that is all black and wanted something to stand out from that - well this is IT!!!!Don't pass up these up.Maggie - Racine, WI"
4,Pleased with product and service,"The product was as advertised, high quality and the delivery service was prompt. Would recommend this seller."
2,Don't care for these.,They lost their luster soon after purchasing them and the size is a little too big. I never wear them anymore.
4,Good value for the price,"These are very pretty, wear anytime earrings. They reflect a variety of colors, primarily yellow due to the ""gold"" plated backside. This gives them more of a citrine color; not the blue seen in the photo.Overall, I think they are a good value for the money, and fun to wear!"
3,too yellow,"These were quite yellow in color when I received them. I wanted clear with colors these were disappointing due to the yellow/gold coloring, Some may like it."
5,Clear AB Crysstal earrings,My daughter had lost a pair of earring that appeared to look like these in the picture. They were perfect and well made. The price was good.
2,"It says it is Swarovski, but no proof of it","I bought these earrings along with the pair for my daughter (SCER168 Butterfly Lavender Swarovski Crystal Sterling Silver 1"" Long Post Drop Earrings) because it says they are Swarovski. But when I received them, they look cheap and I really doubt that they are authentic Swarovski. Kind of felt being cheated. If the seller can approve they are authentic, I am willing to take back this review."
1,Not what I expected,"Expected these to be blue in color, they are yellow. Look like they came from a gumball machine."
1,Not like the picture,I was really disappointed in these earrings. I bought two pairs for gifts and now I don't even know if I should give them. They are so yellow looking and seem cheap. I am regretting my purchase.
5,Beautiful Earrings!,"I bought two pairs, one as a gift for a sister-in-law and the other pair for myself (otherwise I would regret it!) Now my sister keeps complementing how beautuiful the earrings are- I bought another pair as a gift for her! The earrings are absolutely beautiful, the colors that reflect in the light are truly gorgeous. I recommend these for anyone that loves Swarovski crystal."
3,Not as eye catching as one would hope,"Item arrived before the due date and well, it was described accurately. However, I would say pictures in HD would be a welcome addition to get a better idea what they look like. It had slipped my mind that they were Sterling Silver, I took them to a ""silver shop"" to get them replaced - they handed them back saying they were made of silver. Tough, they look cheap. Perhaps I'm too picky. I also ordered this lovely pendant which is much more elegant than the earrings[...]. They both look about the same shape, the blue is fantastic."
3,ok,"they look good, but are very different from the picture. ok, but expected much more for a 25$ value item"
3,"catches the light ever so prettily,",and changes color like a kaleidoscope. i wish i had bought these for all my sisters. I purchased 6 earrings in different colors. The clear crystals were by far the best crystals... i like it!
4,nice earrings,"These earrings are gorgeous. However, in dim light they look orange and yellow. They are the blue and purple when the light is brighter."
2,GOOD AND BAD,"THE EARRINGS ARE VERY PRETTY AND I LOVED THE SIZE. HOWEVER, I WAS TRYING TO MATCH THEM TO A NECKLACE. THESE HAD A ORANGY TONE TO THEM AND WOULD NOT MATCH. HAD TO SEND THEM BACK."
4,Beautiful,I love these earrings but I only gave 4 stars because the color is not as shown in the picture. They have an amber glow to them more than a blue. I still wear them all the time.
2,did not like,Was the wrong color I had imagined from site.....it was yellow and i had invisioned more clear crystal color. Could be in the description and I did not read correcrly.
4,Great size and quality,"With so much yellow on the back you don't get any of the blue, like in the picture, unless in direct sunlight."
2,Yellow tint,It had a yellow tint to it that I wasn't expecting. Also looks a little cheap. Probably won't wear it much.
3,coleen,"Not real happy with these will give out as a gift. Looks plain,with a pretty stone not a show stopper. Hope my sister likes them better than I did."
1,look cheap,I opened the box and was very disappointed. These earrings look VERY cheap. I did purchase other swarovski crystal earrings and they look nice.... go with ones with multiple crystals (the single crystal looks too cheap and ugly)
4,Outlaw Machine,"This was published in 1999, the year beforeWild Ride, by Tom Reynolds. The two books fit well together, and both discuss the role of the outlaw biker in the cultural image and the self-image of non-outlaw riders of H-D motorcycles. Yates spends some time on the topic of how the association of Harley-Davidson motorcycles with the outlaw biker has led to pervasive playacting among Harley riders. This book includes a history of the Harley-Davidson Motor Company (which Reynolds' book doesn't have). The telling of that history is not about the bikes as much as it is about the business-end of it and of how H-D eventually accepted the background influence of the outlaw bikers upon the popularity of their motorcycles."
2,Throwaway Book from a Good Writer,"Yates is a fine writer who took an inherently fascinating topic - a social and corporate history of H-D, its near death in the 70's, and its revival in the '80s and '90s - and phoned it in. Numerous factual errors, poor research and over-the-top psychological profiling are thrown together with minimal organization to prove a point that's never quite defined. Pity, could have been much better."
1,Another author cashing in on us,"I would have thought that someone with the credentials of Mr. Yates would have done better. Instead, he serves up a book that is full of errors that should have been corrected with entry-level research. When something as basic as the correct year for the 50th anniversary of Sturgis is mis-stated, the complete lack of any interest in factual information is evident. I would dare say that Mr. Yates would never tolerate repeated mis-statements of fact without researching the subject in his magazine. He should be ashamed of this. Unfortunately, what he have is just another author whipping up a book without regard to content in the sole search for profit. Please don't waste your money as I did."
4,Good Introduction to Bike History,"Having started with a minibike at age 5, and eventually moving up through dirt bikes, Japanese bikes and eventually to Harley's by the time I was 30, I wanted to know a bit of motorcycle history.I picked up the book on a whim thinking it would have a good bit of history without taking the rest of my life to read, and wasn't disappointed. The book, though not a detailed account of every facet of motorcycling, served its purpose well. It's a good and entertaining introduction into the history of the Harley Davidson.Several of its points rang true. For instance the fact that Japanese bikes, though undoubtedly technologically superior, just don't have the soul of a Harley sums up the reasons I eventually abandoned the former bikes for the American brand (the difference in price tags had a bit to do with buying one later in life as well, come to think of it).I truly enjoyed the book, and would suggest it to anyone who is looking for an introduction into Harley history."
1,still cannot rate it,"I received this product and waited about 2 weeks to open it. Once I opened it, I was dismayed to find that several key pieces were damaged during shipping. My husband is going to try and fix it himself because I didn't discover it until the entire thing was unpacked and, with so many pieces, I cannot imagine how I would even begin to repack it in a way that would get it back. I just get frustrated when you buy a product and have to return it, which seems to happen about 25% of the time these days."
1,Crazy Croc Set by Hot Wheels,"My son had wanted this set since he first saw the commercial on TV. I told him that none of the Hot Wheels sets ever did what they said they would do on TV, but he still got this toy as a present. So sure enough...it doesn't do what it's supposed to do. He probably has way over 300 cars and we haven't been able to find one yet that works with it. I know it says ""not for use with some cars"", but that is ridiculous. So now my son has a toy that doesn't work, but that he won't let me return because he's convinced that someday he will find a car that works. People shouldn't market toys that don't do as shown on TV. This is very misleading to both children and adults. I am not impressed with this set at all."
1,Very Disappointed,"Ho Ho Ho!!My 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it. He's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it. We've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work. The only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again (if you know how to turn the sound off, let me know. I'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire).Do not buy this toy. You'll be very disappointed in it."
1,Hot Wheels Crazy Croc of Crap,My son had some birthday money and could pick any toy in the store. We just assembled it and attempted to play with it and my 6 year old is completely disappointed and I am as well. Do toy makers not test this stuff before they put it out on the public?? I wanted to spare you from making the same mistake..make another toy choice. Makes me feel like I need to go to the toy store with a preapproved list of researched toys.
2,workes sometimes...,"Most of the other reviews for this toy are correct. when it works my kids love it. and it is pretty cool when it works. but it doesn't work very well very often. you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly. and even then the car crashes a lot. we have found one car (out of about 200) that works somewhat well. but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so, read the reviews and make your own judgements. personally, i'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it. my kids will still play with and enjoy it, but not as much as they would if it worked better."
3,To This Day ~Chapter 1: Between Bridges~,"If Every Time I Die and Hatebreed (circa Under the Knife/Satisfaction is the Death of Desire) got married and had children, they would name it To This Day. Trashy riffing, sludgey breakdowns mixed with a tough guy hardcore edge pretty much sums up this album. Nothing earth shattering here but if you dig tough guy hardcore, you'll need this album.For fans of: Throwdown, Hatebreed, Every Time I Die"
2,Wood Bed Risers,"These were very good quality but did not work for what I needed them for. They need to be used on a sturdy base (i.e. hardwoods, tile, etc). We just installed thick carpet with 1/2 inch foam base and because of that, our couches were sunken in and needed to be lifted by a inch or so. And with these wood risers, they were too steep and would knock over way too easily and were a little higher than 1/2 inch."
4,Serving its purpose,"I bought these to help support a sectional couch that was recently purchased. My sectional couch looks as though it is missing two legs, which it isnt. Since I felt that it needs additional legs or support, I bought these bed risers to put under the visible portions of the couch. The brown wood matches the legs on the couch, so it works perfectly. Now my furniture is supported and I feel comfortable sitting in that area now. The packaging was perfect, no damage to the package or the contents. It was worth paying the extra freight fee to receive in 2 days. I would recommend this item."
5,easy!!!,"I needed bed risers to raise the head of my bed 3"" for a medical problem. So I only used two of the four provided, but they worked really well. They are solid and do not slide about and I feel perfectly comfortable with them. The legs of my current bed fit in perfectly."
5,Good Product,Product was as advertised. I chose this item because other items of this type were made of plastic and I had concerns about their durability and even their ability to safely perform the required task. This item is solid and will work for a number of applications where increasing the height of an item of furniture is needed. I use it with a folding chair built to hold 1000 pounds. I don't weigh that much but these risers give me the height I need and a steady seating platform. A great low tech solution. They work.
4,Great for a couch,"These work really great with a burgandy couch we have. They were the perfect height at 4 inches, 6 was way too much. We bought these to raise the couch high enough for a computer stand to roll up underneath. The coloring matches well and it is not obvious that only one couch has these lifters while our loveseat and chair that sit right next to it does not."
3,Wood Bed Risers,"Although these risers work well and look pretty decent when used without stacking, they do not work when stacked. We ordered two sets to stack under a bed, but if you lean even slightly on the bed, the bed will fall over."
3,The price was right!,"This product brought my bed frame to the height needed for me to comfortably get out of bed in the morning and make it. I would suggest a bed skirt to hide them as they aren't the ""prettiest"" to look at."
1,Wood Bed risers,I should have listened to the other reviews. Several of these were cracked in the structure of the wood. I returned them because I was afraid they would crack entirely if used under a bed as a riser.WOOD Bed RISERS lift Table furniture lifts STORAGE
3,These do the job but can be dangerous.,"I wanted to find something to lift my bed up a bit. These, being solid wood and with a wide base seemed like the best. However, they aren't as stable as they appear. If you even accidentally push the bed they can all fall. If you have kids or pets this could be really dangerous for them if they happen to be near/under the bed when that happens. Getting this all into place and with all the lifts in the right place was tricky and the bed fell off them several times as we tried to get it all lined up correctly (actually broke off a corner of one lift too). This is just a full size bed as well. A larger bed would have been worse. They are pretty good for the price and not sure other lifts are any better/steadier, but be forwarned and be careful."
4,Almost...,"This was only thing I could find that will give me enough lift for my couch without raising it too much so I can put storage bin underneath. Looks nice, solid, no cracks and everything else fit the base of the couch except one. Hole is just bit too small that it won't fit. Nothing a sand paper can't fix that's why 4 star not 5"
1,WTF?,Don't buy these. They are cheaply made and the countersunk holes are too small for 2 of my bed legs. I have har t crazy glue 2 of the whatchamacallems back to the thingy. Go buy some bricks or old books or anything but these pieces of junk.
4,Better Than Plastic,The color of the ones I received are redder than the color in the picture. Still feel cheap but a lot better than the plastic ones.
4,Good choice from Amazon- Looks good and works well but...,"I chose these blocks to raise my den couch because of a)the real wood look and b)because they were stackable (in case I wanted to raise my couch more than one block high). I ended up using on;y one block per leg, and what I did not realize ws that sionce they were going on a stone flor, there would be some unevenness. The only issue I have not silved is that the blocks that fit loosely tend to move or swivel if you touch them while cleaning."
4,Decent bed risers,"When I took them out of the box, one bed riser top corner part was off loose in the box, but I glued it back on. Otherwise they are good bed risers - sturdy."
4,space savers,"these worked great. got 4 suitcases under my bed without a problem. more than that, i cant ask for. these are hidden with a dust ruffle and you create tons of space for yourself."
5,Perfect,"Perfect for our purpose which was to secure storage space for our on-board luggage and small packpacks. One block provided this space quite adequately. Be forewarned that some King-sized bed frames may require 6 blocks to accommodate center supports. We wish that the company had anticipated this and offered a King-sized 6-pack kit. Fortunately, we had bought an exra kit in anticipation of needing two blocks on each leg. We avoided the inconvenience of reordering, but still bear the expense of the extra kit."
5,Gave my bed a needed (and stylish) lift.,"These are truly worth every penny; I'm so glad I didn't get something cheaper. Although you can't see much of them under a bed skirt, it's much nicer seeing wood than plastic."
1,trash pure trash,"trust me. pure trash. I TRIED to make these risers function for almost 3 months before I finally gave-up. They broke, cracked, slipped and cause several ""accidents"" in general use. TRASH pure TRASH."
3,Wood bed risers,"Bed risers worked ok, but what I didn't like was the raised pieces are held on by a staple. We used them on a bed thats footprint was 6""x2"" and wanted the edges of the bed risers to help stabalize the bed while being suspended. It worked ok, but I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Solid and nice looking,We got these risers for my 3 year old's bed so he could have more room to play under his bed. They worked great and don't move an inch when he jumps all over the bed everyday. I'm glad they are so sturdy and they look nice too...I don't think the plastic ones would do as well.
3,Check your dimensions,"Don't be fooled by the dimensions of these bedrisers. They do not raise your bed 4 inches as noted in the very UNDETAILED detail of the product. The box claims they raise the bed 3.5 inches. BUT,when the bed posts are inserted into the holes, the bed is only raised 2 3/4 inches. Which makes a big difference if you are making or buying a bedskirt. and, no where in the product description does it confirm that you are in fact receiving 4 risers. I called Amazon prior to ordering and was unable to receive ANY detail such as the info above. Maybe the plastic risers would have been truer to their claims."
4,So far so good,"These do the job but I'm not sure how stable they would be if your bed frame has wheels and you expect to indulge in any exuberant hanky panky. The well is large but not very deep. I stacked them all at the head of my bed to help with acid reflux. They recommend an 8"" angle so these are perfect. I love how they look which is oh so much better then the big clunky black ones, which I've used in the past very successfully. I would use these to raise the height of my bed for underbed storage. Be sure to get the right length bed skirt."
4,great product-bad smell,"I got these for my nine year old son,who had broken the plastic bed lifters by jumping on the bed. The wood bed lifters are great,I do not think he will crack them. They do have a very strong smell. I had to set them outside for two days to let them air out and that helped a lot."
2,Not With my Son-Repeat,"This book was not worth the time it took me to read, if you read the first part...don't waste your time reading this. It is the first book with words rearranged. Although there are little twists in the book it is not very good. I definitely will not be reading the final book!!"
4,this is a text for grad school,I usually sell off my text books but felt this will be useful for future courses. Thorough and explains well.
5,Read the book twice!,"I am completing a masters in Social Work and for the purposes of school I took research in Social Work (second time I am taking research; the first time it was in college) and I read this book twice from cover to cover. It could be a bit dense at the time but hey, it is not a book about butterflies it is a book about research. I liked the book a lot because it clearly explains all the important terminology. I ended up with an A in the class."
3,Aphex Twin's twin,"Like most RDJ fans, I have resorted to picking up any scrap he chooses to release in this anxious post-aphex phase, but owning all the analord recordings may be a little too much. That's not to say that resorting to this compilation will satiate all of your analog needs, but hearing 10+ volumes, especially consecutively, can prove how limited in scope, arrangement, and materials this set is despite many pleasant surprises."
2,cure for insomnia,"this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic ""development"" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release ""young man's disease"" which is better than anything else i've heard this year."
3,A Step Up From Drukqs But...,"Listen to a tune like Ghostman or Goneja from Skinny Puppy's latest CD, The Greater Wrong of the Right, and see how Aphex Twin has been left in their dust. Sorry, but you've been outdone by the best as far as your last two CDs are concerned. I actually like this a lot more than Druqs, though, but he's made considerably better records in the past. But I've also heard something else about this release. Some people believe that he didn't choose the best songs from those vinyl records. I've heard about several other songs from the Analord releases they believe he should have chosen instead of these. But since I don't have a record play I'll never really know. All I can do is decide based on what he chose for this record which was pretty good. It's just that his Ambient Works and RDJ cds were better than this one."
4,A Tour de Force,I wasn't sure what to expect with Richard D. James next album but i'm glad I picked this up. Even though its a sampling from his latest work based on the Analord Series its still a respectable release. More acid oriented harking back to his earlier work it drips with style and tension. Better than Drukqs in many ways its a step in the right direction.Notable tracks include:ReunionCrying in Yur FaceBoxing DayCilonenPWSteal.Ldpinch.DXMD 5a
3,good in a pinch,"I didn't realize I would need a cloth to filter the water -- this is for dirty water than I was aware of. Probably really good for themilitary, or someone hiking in the woods"
5,Billie's best single to date!,"British teen pop sensation Billie Piper has done it again! The smooth, sophisticated ""Something Deep Inside"" is quite possibly her best single to date, following on from such singles as ""Because We Want To"", ""Honey to the B"" and, more recently, ""Day and Night"". Piper is slowly emerging as a more mature and serious pop artist, who is prepared to explore different avenues in music and progress from her earlier, slightly 'younger' approach. This is evident in the lyrics, sound and video clip of ""Something Deep Inside"". If this single is a reflection of the standard of work present in the tracks of her latest album, this is definitely one CD to purchase!"
5,Pure Black Label Society !!!!!,"This DVD is really pure BLS my friends!I love the other BLS DVD ""Boozed Broozed & Broken-Boned"" and the ""Live Brewtality CD""... both are essential for the BLS fans but this ""DOOM TROOPIN' LIVE"" is the best one in my opinion in matter of sound quality and band performance !!!Real good gigs and bonuses on both Discs, the sound and video are fantastic!!!No more words !!!"
5,HEAVY Metal!!!!,"Great concert of really Heavy Metal, and an interlude of great acoustic work. Psychedelic effects with some of the photography went well with the music. Zakk's playing and singing are superb! The musicians with him are also top notch. The only thing I didn't like, and he doesn't do anymore, was all the beer drinking on stage."
3,i was there,"i was stationed in landstuhl germany when the tour came to paris so i went. All i can say is that the sound tech did an amazing job on the dvd because at the show it sounded like zakks mic was just about dead and zakks guitar smothered what everyone else was doing. the only reason i bought the dvd was because i saw a clip and could actually hear everyone elses instrument and hear the vocals.............really wish it sounded that way live, it would have been awesome. im beginning to wonder when zakks ego will deflate and stop taking advantage of his fans. oh well the 3 stars is for the set list and the dvd sound techs, good job guys keep making a big egoed wanna be biker sound awesome."
2,Stop with the Fx,"Not sure why the producers, editors, or whoever feel compelled to use these irritating visual effect in concert vids. It's painfully annoying and you never get the sense you're watching a concert. It's like watching a cheesy video on Mtelevision. The audio is ok but far from great. The extras and London show are nice."
5,Zack Wylde does it again,"If you like heavy metal hard rock and roll, this is the DVD for you. The band is tight and Zack shows why he is one of the leading guitar players out there today. Lot's of shredders are fast, but he is fast and melodic with outstanding tone. The mumerous audience shots during the concert show about 3 women out there, the rest are head banging hard core rockers, so that alone will tell you what your getting with this DVD."
3,"GREAT SET, BUT WHY ALL THE SPECIAL EFFECTS?","ZAKK WYLDE IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BEST GUITARIST'S AND THE BAND PLAYS A GREAT SET, BUT THE EDITING AND SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE VERY DISTRACTING TO VIEW ON THIS DVD. WHY DO VIDEO EDITING PEOPLE THINK THAT WE CAN'T JUST WATCH THE BAND LIVE. THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO ADD SPLIT SCREENS AND DUMB VIDEO EFFECTS. THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE EFFECTS FOR FILMS, NOT CONCERT DVD'S. THE SECOND DVD IS GREAT AND SHOWS 3 VIDEOS AND HAS SOME GREAT BACKSTAGE FOOTAGE. I TAKE AWAY 1 STAR FOR THE EDITING AND 1 FOR THE SOUND. IF YOU ARE A BIG BLS FAN YOU MAY WANT THIS IN YOUR COLLECTION. IF NOT, I RECOMMEND THE BOOZED, BROZED AND BROKEN BONES DVD."
5,Jan Eliot never disappoints!,"As always, I immensely enjoyed this collection of Stone Soup comic strips. It covers a lot of demographic ground, from toddlers to teens, and from middle-agers to golden-agers. The characters are endearing, the writing is lively and funny, and the situations are eerily familiar. In short, what's not to love?"
5,Great Book!,This was an enjoyable and great book for my Dad! He loves it! I am going to buy more Stone Soup books!
4,A great coming of age story.,"I first read this book about 20 years ago. I recently found it and re-read it. I'm keeping it in my sons room for when he's old enough to read. It's a great story that teaches right from wrong, good versus evil, and about life and death. It does contain a couple hunting sequences."
2,"This book looked hilarious, but one mustn't judge a book by its cover","The illustrations were great, and I found that the one page of text was addictive (the author originally published these in their newspaper column) but apart from one or two vignettes, it didn't have the ""laugh out loud"" factor that I thought I was promised by the cover. I skipped through most of it because it was too tiresome to read.Obviously I am here in New Zealand and unaware of the situation in Britain where these social stereotypes apparently exist. But this book isn't by the British version of Dorothy Parker, from what I can tell."
2,Why I left England,"Ah, England. A country full of lovely people...with the depressing, lethal trait of wanting to feel socially superior to someone else. Enter this book of 200-word character portraits of such archetypes as the Politically Correct Vicar (pastor) or the Uninvited Weekend Guest, collected from the pages of the Telegraph newspaper.You have to ask yourself, what is the point? Who would read this, and why? I think the answer is, people who want to feel part of a superior social group but are not. You can be sure that the real toffs feel no need to read this drivel, and the Telegraph is rarely read by what one would call 'blue-collar' workers, so that leaves a swathe of middle-class people who think that by snickering at these portraits they are somehow superior. OK, so I know it's a little bit of fun, but it just utterly depressed me.I'm awarding this book two stars solely because of the excellent illustrations, by Sue Macartney-Snape. Otherwise, drivel."
2,Makes good points but has an agenda,"I loved the concept of this book and had such hopes for it. However, the author's whole point is this: men should share equally in all the parenting duties (what a brilliant idea that no woman ever thought of before!), and corporations need to accommodate working moms and be genuinely flexible about it (another fabulously original notion), and no woman should ever be a stay-at-home mom because of all the things it deprives her of and deprives her child of a lot of things to (excuse me? what about personal choice? just because I plan to continue to work in an office doesn't mean I'm going to tell other women what to do). She makes these points in the first two chapters, which otherwise make some pretty good points except for the obvious agenda. After that it becomes kind of a storybook about all of her friends."
5,Extension to KidCo PlayDen,Well worth the purchase. We bought the KidCo PlayDen and then bought 4 of these extensions. Our daughter is 1 year and has more then enough room to play in and is safe. It is really easy to assemble as well.
5,Very Funny Movie!,"I wasn't expecting much from this DVD when I got it as a gift from a big Ron Jeremy Fan. Let me tell you this was HIRLARIOUS. Andy Dick plays Ron's porn acting coach and is great! The movie is packed with extras including Ron's complete stand-up comedy act that he actually performs on the road and a segment that had me laughing non-stop called ""Inside The Porn Actors Studio"" where Ron goes into graphic details in front of a captive audience on everything you've always wanted to know about his life and career in porn. There is a special section on the DVD called ""Backstage with The Porn Stars"" where there is tons of nudity by some of the porn worlds hottest women inluding Gauge, Marey Carey, Kendra jade, Teri Weigel, Kira Eggers and much more!"
1,I hate it,I gave this book this rating because I think that it is boring. It tries to go into detail about Paul and his Prison letters but this book just does not do it in an intriguing way.
5,Letters of Paul Book,The book was as advertised. Excellent condition and arrived promptly. Very pleased with the seller.
4,A must read!,This book is an eye opener. It not only gives a well rounded perspective on marketing for legal firms but explores the causes of why firms function the way they do. The deep insights presented in the book from an insiders viewpoint provide the basis for the compelling arguments Henry makes.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I believe my business will benefit from what I have learned from it - and I'm not in the law business. Indeed Henry's ideas have a very broad application although the examples center around the law business.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to improve the way their organizations function.
5,Insightful and Practical,"This is a great book. Dahut's analysis of the mindset of the lawyer as he goes about marketing and managing his practice is frighteningly accurate - the way we think as lawyers clearly restricts our ability to be good enterprise builders. Dahut's discussion on law firm branding and leadership building was right on the money. I would recommend this book highly to other lawyers - in fact, it should be required reading in law schools. Finally, while the book is a little on the pricey side, I got my money's worth and then some.I give this book five stars."
5,Good product,"Just what I needed for my calligraphy. High quality,, even though it is a little smaller than I would have liked."
2,Give Frank another chance--he is much better than this,"Frank Morgan is an extraordinary ballad player, and he can cook with the best of the best. I don't care to hear Frank using organ and congas in his rhythm section as is the case here. He is much mellower with just piano accompaniment. A glimmer of the true Frank Morgan can be heard on this album in ""My Old Flame"". Has anyone ever played a more melancholy alto sax? If you must buy this album, go ahead, no one ever came up short listening to Frank Morgan. If you are not turned on by this album, give his ""Yardbird Suite"" or ""You Must Believe In Spring"" albums an ear. Frank Morgan is truly a national musical treasure."
4,Does what it's supposed to and does it well,"My wife sometimes had trouble opening the entrance door of our house and this product solved the problem. I was considering installing lever door knobs but these grips seemed like they would be a much easier, cheaper solution. They installed easily in seconds. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is they are a bit unsightly."
4,Good Grippers,Make turning knobs easier. Easy to install. Last longer inside than outside. Have bought several at different times. Work well.
1,OOOver Priced !!!!!!! this book is available for 12.95 everywhere,This book sis available at most online stores and Pilots shops for 12.95.I'm surprised it is listed at Amazon for 149 dollars...!!!!!!!This is sad. I buy so much many products from amazon. Now I dont know if I should trust the prices on Amason and buy.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Prepare to be annoyed!,Illustrator is a good program but CS is junk. There are a slight few reasons to use CS over 10 but for those few features you have to deal with the program crashing about 3-5 times a day (and note I work in Illustrator from 9-5). And if that wasn't bad enough most of the time it crashed it while you're trying to save as if to make you as mad as possible. Also you can't save for previous versions which is a serious flaw considering not everyone is dumb enough to shell out the $500 for the CS.I'm glad that I got to try this out at work where I didn't pay for it and that I still have my Illustrator 10 at home.I hope Adobe clues in to everyone writing bad reviews and decides to actually check their program before releasing it. Until then SAVE YOUR MONEY!
3,Decent Product. HORRIBLE support.,"This may be one of the better vector graphic programs, but does not appear to have been tested. I will update this review more as I use the program more. But today is day one, and it has one MAJOR bug already.You know how much Photoshop CS costs. And you know how much Illustrator CS costs.So imagine buying the full Illustrator CS. You install it. And it will not open ANY JPEG pictures taken by certain SONY DIGITAL CAMERAS. The program just bombs out every time. To work around this bug you have to open the pix in any other program, like Photoshop CS, and resave them. Nor will it load TIFFs from these SONY cameras. But every other program will including Adobe Photoshop. So when I call support, with a product that is only 1 hour old, they want a credit card number in case they decide to charge me $39.I dunno. I hope these CS products last me a long time. Because I don't think I'll buy more Adobe. They charge way too much money to treat customers like this."
3,Major Bugs Remain,"I have been using Illustrator professionally since version 6 was cutting edge. I like the product and understand how to use the various tools, how to place images, and basically WHY the thing costs $500. This is a marginal upgrade over 10 in many areas, a downgrade in terms of back-compatability, and a major upgrade in terms of additional filters and effects. Overall, about what you would expect for a version upgrade. Not nearly as major as the difference between 8 and 9, but substantial enough to warrant the upgrade price.But there are some major bugs that have been in place for months now. They have been noted in the Adobe forums, with no response from Adobe or indication that they have any intention of repairing them. I recommend that you don't buy this product until Adobe releases their next upgrade."
5,This Is A Must-Have,"This set includes 5 music CD's plus 1 preaching CD. All six are good ones and each individual CD is put together according to a single theme; salvation, judgement, etc. I listen to this over and over again and I never tire of it. Maybe this is a bit pricy, but still it's worth every cent."
5,Buy this!,"This a very valuable collection of gospel music. Be aware that is all gospel. Is is nearly all old time gospel, and it gives us a rich history of the passion that goes into this form of music. If you are a lover of folk music you should own this set.The performers are now saved for all time! The one drawback is the insanley stupid packaging-a wooden box that does not work! I threw mine away. What were they thinking??"
3,"Venom is scary, even in toy form","This pumped up plush action figure (to call it a doll would really upset my son) is soft enough to cuddle but not too soft. His head is made of plastic and I love the details of his face. The only problem is that after only a week, his white stuffing is visable, as it poke through his skin, here and there."
4,Lift Log:Diary and Guide for Strength Training,"I think this is an excellent book to carry around the gym as you work out. It has a bit of warm-up and stretching exercises, nutrition, anatomy, and basic suggestions for organizing workouts, and how to use the book. There are also worksheets for body measurements and progressions. The diary itself is set up very simply to allow you to keep track in your own way. The only negative thing that I can see is the pictures of the women -- they are more like ""cheesecake"" than actual bodybuilders. I can't believe that anyone could lift weights in a thong!"
5,Best log book / planner for the weight room,"The freedom to fill in your work out routine in your own style, make changes from day to day and the easy to use format, make this book tops in the world of workout log books. And, better than a ""I have an ap for that"", it never goes bad from being dropped or other mis-use and will be there next year when you do your yearly progress review....nice low tech solution that just plain works. Hope they go back into print."
2,not that great,limited flexibility for those who liftI don't find the 14 day review sections useful.Only has space for 4 sets of exercises. Joe Oliver's log is much better
2,So - So,"This is in no way compared to the Acura part. The number of pleats are way less and weighs less compared to the acura OEM, meaning less surface area, thus reducing the capacity to filter and possible air flow. I dont have any numbers to validate this but, I am not going to get this again. I have not seen any power difference but I dont think this will last as long as the OEM. This fits well and the product did not have any damage."
3,R Lundsten?,R Lundsten is quite a legend in Sweden. Some kind of studio wiz who has released I do not know how many records. Of varying quality.
5,good knife,"pros: solid constructionhawkbill curved bladecomfortable to holdgreat liner lockthumb stud for quick-flick openingsharp as sin out of the box, and easy to sharpen with one of those cheapo $10 hand sharpenerscons: well i'd hate to use a whetstone on something like this! the curve makes it really weird to sharpen on the stone like my other knivesbut i have a cheapo $10 sharpener that i used to put a bit more edge on it after some heavy use.considering the metal its made of is only 440 steel i believe, it holds an edge great, and is a great value for what you get out of it.i carry this thing every day and use it every day, hawkbill knives are the best for cutting in my opinion.also makes a good gift because it doesn't look half bad and the functionality of it is outstanding for the price."
4,"Jazzy Jewelry : Power Beads, Crystals, Chokers, & Illusion a","Excellent book. My 12 year loved the book, easy instuctions."
3,Zildjian Gong,"Beautiful gong sounds nice but the stand pictured is not the stand you get. I ended up getting a square stand. Also, it did not come with a mallet so I had to go to the music store to buy a mallet, and guess what? They don't sell single mallets. I had to buy a pair, cut it shorter and drill a hole so I can hang it from the stand like it's supposed to be. Oh well, at least I have an extra mallet."
3,groove fizzled out!,"...GC seems to have some what lost their jazz sensibilities with this one. Altough, most of the trax smoke, the groove is fizzled. They had it real tight upto ""dance of the drunken master"", but now they seem to be banking on the dance/hip-hop audience (ignoring fellow boppers). BUT, they still churn out some of the best jazz-funk music today.Check out the cuban funk of ""Sabrosona"" or the jazzed-up,heavy-improv of Lennon-McCartney's ""Martha my dear"""
3,Bad Batch,My Mother has to use this product the last ones that I received from you seem to repel the liquid not soak it up. Maybe it was a bad batch? All others have been great. This is the best idea since I do not know when.
3,Mixed feelings,"I am a big fan of the show. I was pleased to get the boxed set. I was however disappponted to see how poorly packaged it was.Unlike most boxed sets, with each disc packaged separately, the set comes in a stacked container..definitely not the best forrepeated handling. Cost cutting at its best."
4,Great Writing,"This series was just a great, entertaining little sitcom. Very familiar with some of the situations, as I used to work in the broadcast news biz. The show tanked a bit after Phil Hartman died, but I'm not blaming anyone for it. Definitely worth the purchase."
2,"Good Show, Bad Packaging.","This show was under the radar in terms of everything, in my opinion. When you talk about Newsradio, people remember it, but they don't remember watching it. The series was cancelled after Phil Hartman died and Jon Lovitz stepped in.The series was great and had it's moments, but this DVD package is utterly horrible. This is a review of the DVD, not just the show, which is why I had to give it such a low rating. This is a product review and the packaging for this product stinks.The dvd case is the type of plastic the halloween masks are made out of and the dvd are piled ontop of one another like a blank DVD case pack. Prone to easy scratches and difficult to get to the certain disc you want. Why the hell they couldn't put together a normal DVD package is beyond me.The show was good, but this DVD package is more ghetto than the streets.Be warned."
4,"Great Show , unexpected packaging","First off, this is a great show and I love it. But when I ordered it and it said ""slim packaging"" I was expecting maybe 3 dvd cases that held 4 dvd's in each. What I got was a small spindle with all 12 dvd's just stacked up on each other.The reason for my 4 stars rather than 5 is most likely an issolated incident. When I opened my copy to make sure everything was there, I was missing Season 1 Disc 1. Which was easily replaceable."
4,Fantastic series ... shame about the box,"The series is 5-star. I was a little worried it would have aged since I saw this in the 90s, but it really hasn't. I buy a lot of DVDs, some of which sit on the shelf a very long time before; but not this - I've been watching an episode of two most nights since it arrived. An exemplar of how an office sitcom is supposed to work.Great special features, but the worst box in the history of box sets. The set is cheap, and you get what you pay for, I guess, but I'd have happily paid an extra couple of bucks for something sturdier and less prone to dvd damage."
5,GREAT,"This show is probably better then we even know. This is a part of history from the 90s. Although I like married with children better then this, this comes right after it. Its really sad what happened to Phil Hartman. He was such a funny guy and then to have his life end at what some call his peak in such a tragic way. Season 5 tried but I really feel that it just didn't work, but it was still funny none the less. Oh and I just don't understand that Andy Dick what the heck is wrong with him... you always see him on some stupid reality TV show about rehab or something it is so freaking lame he is in his 40's, while I'm 20 and more mature then him..."
1,"Thanks Reviewers,",I wouldn't buy this poorly packaged product after reading the reviews. I vote with my wallet. Make whoever made the decision to package it poorly eat them.
2,"Great show, TERRIBLE PACKAGING","The other reviews are right... TERRIBLE PACKAGING! The DVDs are just stacked on top of each other on a spindle. No paper separators, nothing to keep the discs from scratching, and you have to pull out all the DVDs above the one you want to get to. Pathetic. But, a brilliantly done show."
1,Same old stuff with a new cover,"When I saw the gorgeous bike on the cover I had to buy this. A sculptured frame and single sided rear plus the title ""Techno-chop"" gives the impression that you are about to see some unusual, technically challenging artistic and creative bikes.BUT.........Sadly when you read and look at the pictures it's the same old stuff that we have all seen before. Mediocre pictures wrapped up in excessive jounalistic mumbo jumbo. Reading it will send you to sleep. Some parts were boring enough to skip altogether. It appears to me that someone was offered $xxxx to write 5000? words on custom motorcycles and sat down and did it.If you are looking for inspiration to do something yourself and fancy the type of bike on the cover, then like me you will be disappointed. I couldn't even find out who made that bike - there is no credit that I can find in the book. You could probably get better information but searching on Google.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!"
5,A GOOD READ,I enjoyed this book thoroughly. If you like Richard Brautigan then you like Harlan Ellison then you will probably like Charles Parkinson. He has the same twisted skew. He writes the Pacific North west so well you can almost feel the rain in your face. I recommend it.
1,no DVD?,"Why on earth is Season 1 NOT out on DVD yet?? It's the best, and my most favorite season, and the only form in which I can find it is video-on-demand. I hate that."
1,Amazon video is crap,"I rarely ever purchase videos online when I can find them on Hulu or Sidereel for free, but I really wanted to watch this episode of Top Chef (and couldn't find it elsewhere), so I decided to splurge on a fancy 99 cent Amazon tv show. And boy, was I astounded by how terrible the quality was. The loading time is absolutely terrible, this show has been buffering for over half an hour but still won't play. I'm getting a ""very poor signal"" despite having a strong WiFi connection that readily loads other videos while this one slogs along and intermittently freezes. One would think that the Amazon version of the video would be of superior quality than that of a pirated version on Megavideo, but clearly that is not the case. Do not waste money on crappy Amazon shows when you can find faster-loading, higher-quality versions for free elsewhere."
2,Trashy,"My family, including my wife and 2 pre-teen daughters, love cooking shows. We enjoy Chopped, Next Food Network Star, etc. So we decided to try Top Chef Season 1.Big mistake. It is trashy.Every other word is the F-bomb. Episodes include an overtly spicy S&M;/bondage party. It is simply a show that could have been so much more.It would have been a 5 star show without all the nonsense."
4,Great Start to a Terrific Show,"I started watching Top Chef in season 3, so it was fun to go back and watch seasons 1 and 2. It's enjoyable to see how Top Chef has developed since the first season. The first couple of episodes are a little slow, but the show definitely gets better as it goes along, and the final five or six chefs could stand up against the chefs from any of the other seasons. Although it has its moments, Season 1 is less focused on personality conflicts than Season 2. I'd recommend it to any Top Chef fan!"
3,Rough Start to a good series,It's fun to go back and watch the old episodes of top chef. The whole show feels only like a reality TV show while the newer ones are more than that.
4,A must-have for beaded bag fans,"This is a really great book for anyone interested in learning how to make beaded bags, without knitting. The designs are incredible. There are projects for all levels, ie. the Sequin covered bag is perfect for the beginner while the Stained Glass or Japanese Bags are ideal for those wanting more challenge. Her technique explanations are so clearly written, you'll be able to pick up your needle and start right away. I liked most of the colours used for the bags, but you can use what you like. There's a lot of work involved to complete a project, but the results are stunning. In my opinion, the only thing lacking was a Supplier List at the back of the book, specifically for purse frames which can be tricky to find."
1,CMT glass panel retainer is junk,"I purchased Sommerfeld's Glass Panel router bit set from Sommerfeld's Tools for Wood online and CMT glass panel retainer from a local wood working store. Sommerfeld's slot cutter, which is exactly the same as CMT's slot cutter, cuts a 1/8"" slot to accept the retainer, but upon trying to install it I found it nearly impossible. It also busted out the wood on the back of the frame in a couple spots. After an hours time and bruised finger tips, I ended up siliconing the glass into the frames and trashing the retainer. I am a wood worker and know what I'm doing. This stuff is a waste of time and money. Stay away!"
4,Unique Insight Into Froebel's Surreal Kindergarten,"Not only did Froebel's ideas somewhat baffled early/mid 19th Century Germany, but they feared his somewhat oddball approach to children by allowing them to ""work"" with peculiar, open-ended objects. Some in Switzerland even labeled him a heretic to the church. Enlightening ideas like these turn Brosterman's (not even an early childhood professional)book into a wealth of information.One of the amazing ideas that I uncovered came in the form of how many different Gifts existed. I thought Froebel only made ten, but TWENTY existed.Please read this book over at least so that you can take a gander at the wonderfully valuable pictures of the original classroom and the original Milton Bradley-made gifts."
3,Clean Cotton,"This fragrance doesn't fill the room as other Yankee Candles. I will go back to peach, vanilla, or rose scents."
4,Nice smell but it does leave residue.,First off this candle will burn a long time so it's worth the extra money. The smell is very clean and takes over a medium to large size room. I'd give it a 5 but they are a little overpriced and the candle does leave residue in the air.
1,25 Dollars and Can't even smell it!,I cannot believe i spent [...] bucks on this candle and you can't smell it at all.. VERY DISAPPOINTED.. I thought Yankee Candles were supposed to be the best.. Never again will i waste my money on them. :(
3,okay but not great,"Although I am a big fan of Chinaberry and all that that complany does this book was disappointing.Misleading title too. As one reviewer noted, the range and titles of books is limited to picture books and even those aren't the best of the best, but some real ho-hum choices. Why wasn't this mentioned as this is why I bought the book?? I wanted a guide for good books that span parenting.This book is okay but not great. I think Anne and Patti could have done a lot better"
5,The Other World,"This book was given to me by my husband.-Mary Mock I was raised in a family that was reasonably close to ""Father Knows Best"". I had classmates from the ""Other World"" but knew little about their homes/lives. Nel opened up that world and its inhabitants with her well integrated characterizations and descriptions of Tiny, the birds of the flyway, the sheriff, inner termoil, fears, disappointments, and finally understanding. I truly look forward to her next book but wouldn't mind a bit if she wrote a sequal to this one."
3,"So Near, Yet So Far","I am so ambivalent about this book. It adheres to the genre that I really, really like: Romantic, erotic, paranormal fantasy. The story lines are exactly that. BUT I felt the stories, especially ""Beauty Ravished,"" seemed hurried and the plots skeletal frameworks for the erotic scenes. I kept wanting all the stories to be more fully fleshed out; each had the potential to be a solo book. The erotic scenes are great. The endings, for the most part, are way too abrupt. When I finished ""Beauty Ravished,"" my jaw just dropped. I couldn't believe that was the end! I kept saying to myself, ""And then what?"" Finally, unlike previous reviewers, I found the numerous misspellings, missing words, incorrect words, and grammatical faux pas to be really jarring. To sum up: a great idea for an anthology, great plot outlines, but everything seemed careless, rushed, and skimpy."
4,Very nice,"I've been wearing these shoes for about 2 weeks now and I really like them. They fit great from the first wearing, which is rare for me. They may not be the most attractive shoes, but they feel good. I wear them with jeans, dress pants, and skirts with dark tights."
5,For the wife,"My wife found EARTH shoes a few years ago....she swears by them! They have improved her posture tremendously! She has a pair that she's worn for over 3 years, except for the scuffs on the top you would never know that she wore them daily for the past 3 years! Great shoes! She loves them!!!"
5,Found the Earth Shoes I wore in the 70's,"I wore Earth shoes as a teenager in the 70's because they felt soooo good. At that time, I just picked them up in the mall. Not only are they comfortable, I will purchase from any company that manufactures in the USA. 2 excellent reasons to utilize this company and give them your business."
2,not as comfortable as I had hoped.,"I have worn Earth sandals and loved them, but the new line of dress shoes do not lend themselves to the same comfort level as the sandals. These shoes caused blister at the heal."
4,Very stylish and great for the long waisted,I like the suit very much. I need the long waisted style and the blouson will hide the tire I was getting. I have recently lost 15 pounds so hope this will still fit....
5,Modern Latin Jazz at it's best,"This music is perhaps the real future of Jazz. It is so creative, it is modern and it contains many different elements, from cuban music to jazz and also some funk grooves. There is a lot of place for great improvisations too. From the rythmical point of view, it is very very impressive. The musicians are of course at the top level. The drummer Dafnis Prieto is performing here some of the greatets drumming I've ever heard. The leader Yosvany Terry Cabrera has surely true composition skills. For me, it's a must buy if you are into modern latin jazz."
1,League of heroes from classical literature soiled by Alan Moore,"Definitely a title NOT intended for children, the second volume of League of Extraordinary Heroes features more of Moore's dark and subversive story-telling. And not being good enough to create his own characters, he's taken otherwise wholesome (and PUBLIC DOMAIN) characters from classic literature and warped and perverted these characters into violent, disgusting anti-heroes.It's almost like Moore has an adgenda here: take popular characters from classics and find a way to soil them in a violent, disinteresting (and ultimately forgettable) book. The art is fairly bad too."
4,Well crafted but not as good as the original,A great read and well worth the money but not as good as the original
5,"Review of Moore's Gentlemen, Volume 2","Another volume of masterful play--Moore does an excellent job develop his characters in new and interesting ways. The entrance of extraterrestrial invaders seems a little odd, but it's handled really well by the author. If you're really fond of any characters, consider skipping this title: they suffer odd and unexpected fates."
5,The League at it's best!,"I loved volume 1 and volume 2 was even better. I thoroughly enjoyed the Almanac section of the book and the cool board game and other little ""quips"" that were added by Moore and O'Neill. There is a little more sexual content in this volume, but it doesn't detract from the book at all. If you are an Allan Moore fan don't pass this book up and Kevin O'Neill's artistry has a superb fit with Alan's writing especially with the time period that The League is portrayed in. It's well worth the money and I can't wait to get the next in the series, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier!"
2,Nothing. Happens.,"The dialog is good, some of the characteriziation is good but in order to make a story stand out you need... a story. Martians invade, Quartermain and Miss harker go out of town and with no resistance pick up a box. Hyde fights for 3 panels. The end. The characters aren't DOING enough and excpet for Hyde aren't even remotely clever or engaging. One of your characters is a super genius, one is a superb tactician.. have them at least TRY something more brilliant than blow up the bridge and wait."
5,Alan Moore does it again,"Anyone who is a true comic book geek knows that Alan Moore is one of the best writers ever, with awesome story, detailed research when it comes to From Hell(check it out), and imagination combined with amazing knowledge of whatever he writes about he really brings story to life, to reality. So its no surprise that this work of art is awesome read, and Kevin O'Neill 's art is truly beautiful and fits into this story so well, great layout of panels, and don't freak out regarding first few text balloons you didn't get some weirdly translated comic book just keep on reading :) , also read Vol1, don't let the movie ruin the really awesome comic book or should I say graphic novel. BTW this graphic novel actually has last 20pages or so actual mini novel sort of."
2,Very Weak Kindle Version,"This is not a review for the work, which, being Alan Moore, I'm sure is excellent. But the Kindle interactivity is very poor. There are pop ups of individual panels, but they are barely any bigger than the full page view. You can't pinch-zoom in or out or move within the smallish versions that to pop out. Nor can you turn the Kindle for a wider landscape view. All of these perks are available in almost all digital comics these days, and they've been available in most graphic novels I've bought digitally. Here, I'm very unsatisfied and wish I had my money back."
3,Fun series but not my favorite,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a good series, but in my opinion not great. Despite Alan's Moore's genius, there's better series out there than this one."
2,Not as solid as the First,"Unless you are a die-hard Moore fan, pick up volume 1 and leave #2 on the shelf.The two stars is for the consistent quality of the artwork and thats about it. I like Moore, but this story falls way short of the first LXG and tends to cover it's lack of plot with a pointless romance and ridiculous traitor sub-plot.The fact that it was released as a harccover with an over inflated pricetag doesn't help matters either. After reading the first LXG I was entertained and delighted with my purchase. After finishing this installment I shook my head in anger at the money and time wasted."
1,very boring,"Allan Moore has no new ideas. long boring dialogues about nothing and Mina having sex doesnt have shock value he intended to.the comic book story is only about half of the book there comes only printed text. What a rip off.after reading League, Tom Stromg, Promethea i am afraid Watchmen was one hit wonder."
3,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Vol. 2 aka It's alright","Almost everybody has their assumptions before they read something, having only seen the movie based off of Vol 1 & Vol 2, you can imagine my impressions. I will be short and to the point however. Having not read The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Vol. 1, I read Vol. 2 and thought it was, OK. I won't say great or fantastic cause I just can't do it. I read to the end of the illustrations more or less and just didn't feel like putting in that much effort to read the loads of ""journal-type entries"" after the story. I skimmed over them to see if I could find more about the characters of Mina and Quartermain but, after a point said, to heck with this. This is a book I am glad I checked out of the library instead of bought, as I would have regretted spending the money on it. This book by no means was bad, it just wasn't really my cuppa tea."
2,"Tedious, Not Moore's Best","I particularly found the insertion of long blocks of ""newsprint"" boring and only barely finished this book. As a Moore fan I really feel this is not his best work."
3,Angry and Disconected,"Although the art continues to be as impresive as in the first volume, the story feels broken trying to tie too many things together without keeping the big picture in mind, so no themes are developted and they are loosely stiched together. It was also my impresion that Moore feels angry and some scenes feeled pushed into the story just to show them and generate some sort of reaction from the reader, with no relevance or importance in the story (it could be said that it is part of character development, but they feel crude and forced in the story)."
2,Not the Best of Poetry,"This collection is badly designed, with the indexes in the middle of the book, and no Table of Contents. The choices of poems are quite random, leaving out the most important poetry one would want to turn to. The print is ugly and the paper cheap. I was quite disappointed and misled by the cover picture. [...]"
4,many original papers,"For students of the history of maths, Smith provides you with a very convenient reference. He has gone back to many of the original papers by Newton, Pascal and others, and gathered 125 of these into this book. You can search for insight into how those luminaries made their important discoveries. As an added utility, the papers have been translated into English.An amazing time saver. For he lets you access the papers without any intermediary. The alternative would be to spend months searching in some large research library. And also probably having to order copies made from other libraries. At non-trivial cost in time and money."
4,Must-have book for drama teachers!,"I've purchased several copies of this book over the years because my teaching artist friends like to borrow it and never return it! It's packed full of great set-ups for scene work, leaving the leader free to side-coach the players rather than cook up yet another scenario!"
4,All ready knew the answer,Just revealed what I already knew! Public education should be controled by the individual states not the FEDERAL GOVENMENT. Self-esteem is something you earn through hard work. It is not an entitlement. Rk from Mo.
2,Unarmed Combatives 7,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, vastly improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and much cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all."
2,WHAT????,"I saw this in a bin for $2. It looked so corny, that I bought it just for kicks. Track two has a catchy beat and flow to it. Thats it. Everything else sucks. Rhymes, beats, flows, messages, etc. It all sucks. If you actually find one of these somewhere, dont buy it. These guys are so old, I dont think anyone will ever even read this review anyway. I wonder where they are today?"
2,A bit dull by anyone's standards,"I only liked maybe two or three stories in this entire collection. The rest were pretty timid and uneventful, as though Updike were afraid of getting his hands dirty and immersing himself in the flesh and bone realities of life and narrative. This hesitation to actually ""go for it"" is a hallmark of all of Updike's fiction in my opinion, which leaves all of his stories devoid of what you might call narrative vitality, or realness. It is this distance between Updike and what he's writing about that leads the reader to believe that Updike is not writing a story but merely philosophizing about one. Updike's pompous abstractions inevitably deprive these stories of a vigour that they might otherwise have."
3,"Yes, but.....",I had this last year and really loved it....until the racoons found it and totally destroyed it. (The tube is plastic) It's too expensive to just throw away.
3,An 'ok' read,"This is not one of Balogh's best books by a long chalk, but what is an average attempt for her, is brilliant for a lot of the authors. Not a keeper for me, but still a respectable read."
2,Training vs. Demo,This video is well made however it is not designed to be a educational training tool. The video only shows the dummy form. It does not show any applications. If you want to just see the dummy form then the video does its job. If you are wishing to learn applications or finer points of the dummy this video is not for you.
4,Great Band Strikes Again,"I saw these guys in my hometown several months ago and was completely blown away. I bought Echo Echo and my friend got thier live double CD and they both were in heavy rotation on my car stereo. This album sounds more mature and a little darker than some of their other stuff. However, I really enjoy it and it seems to get better every time I hear it. It takes more than one listen to capture some of the brilliant hooks and melodies. I completely recommend this album to anyone who likes intelligent music you can sing along to. I also recommend their live show which is amazing."
4,Original sound worth a listen,"Carbonleaf grabbed my attention last year with their song ""The Boxer,"" a melodic rock song that incorporated cascading drums, harmonizing voices, acoustic and electric guitars, and of all things, a flute. I thought that it was one of the most original songs that I had heard. With my purchase of ""Indian Summer,"" Carbonleaf proves that originally is their specialty.Imagine the vocal arrangements of The Crash Test Dummies, the musical technique of Dave Matthews, and the lyrical poignancy of Five for Fighting - throw in a Celtic rhythm and a strong bass line and you have Carbonleaf. Their most recent single, ""Life Less Ordinary,"" is a beautiful song about unreciprocated but unapologetic love. While I could have done without a song or two (Raise the Roof and This is My Song), the rest of the songs demand to be replayed, and replayed often."
5,"Carbon Leaf's ""Indian Summer"" is amazing","I absolutely love this album. There just that 'something' about this album that makes it worth listening over and over again. My two favorite tracks are ""What About Everything?"" and ""Changeless"".Would definitely recommend this to others. :)"
2,Misleading Quality Rating,"This item is rated at ""Used - Very Good."" The CD case was fine, but the actual disc was in very poor shape, covered almost entirely in scratches."
2,Boring,"Many albums, including this one, have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks. The use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music. ""What About Everything"" and ""Life Less Ordinary"" are good songs. The rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep."
2,yawn,"I just bought this album since I enjoyed Echo Echo a lot. Unfortunately Carbon Leaf seems to have succumbed to that horrible disease that strikes just after a successful album. Indian Summer is totally derivative of, well, Echo Echo. Same rhythms, same melodies, same pacing, same songs. Every song on this album has a twin on Echo Echo and I'm bored silly on the first listen. Buy Echo Echo and you'll get to hear Indian Summer too!"
5,Replay!,"When I heard ""A Life Less Ordinary"" for the first time on the radio, the phrasing of the lines,""You blew away my storm and strifeAnd it shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me.""was like nothing I had ever heard before. After finding cuts online (especially The Boxer and On Any Given Day), I bought Indian Summer.The last time I listened to an album over and over and over like this was Counting Crows' August and Everything After. Previous to that, it had been 10,000 Maniacs' In My Tribe. So I don't flip for an album very often. I have for this one, though.Beautifully produced and well-written, this is an amazing album on so many levels."
5,A Most Pleasant Suprise,"Music Lovers, you will love this record!! This is one of the very few records that I have not been able to pick the hit, my favorite, on the first listen. I have been trying now, after 3 in a row on the , listening, that is, on the job, on the road, trying to pay more attention to the traffic than the volume, but play it loud .These are all great songs, and they get even better with each play.Enjoy!!!"
5,This is one of the best in my CD collection!,"Saw this band play in Lincoln, NE, last summer. Found the music pretty catchy and purchased some of their earlier music. Got hooked and couldn't wait for their newest album, Indian Summer. It's absolutely the best yet! Every single song on the album is catchy, with my favorite being ""What About Everything."" The band manages to be both upbeat and thoughtful at the same time. Totally recommended!!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I was looking for a book that would detail remedies first-century Jews used for various maladies. For example, Paul wrote Timothy to use wine for his stomach. What did they use for pregnancy? Fever? Colds? I was expecting an encyclopedia of maladies and their remedies.This is an encyclopedia of maladies and their Jewish viewpoints. For example, ?all? the references on fevers up to the Middle Ages, as I recall. I didn't find it very useful, so I returned it and ordered 'Miracle Bible Cures' or something. This is useless also. Now I'm trying Medicine, Miracle and Magic by Howard Clark Kee. Hopefully that will work!It appeared to be well researched, but not very useful.Later note: I found the book by Howard Clark Kee, mentioned above, fairly useful. You can see my review of it under that product."
4,Which Jesus Is Your Jesus?,"Prothero's book is an utterly interesting read about Jesus, His effect on American culture, and American culture's effects on Him. The book spares no expense in research or in clear writing to bring you a clear and concise look at how America has seen Jesus, has changed Jesus to its liking, and sees Jesus today.It's a quick read for the 300 some odd pages that you plow through like the latest best-seller novel. Prothero's writing is not only informative, but entertaining - dropping hints here and there about his ulterior motive - to show that the Jesus of Christianity is the Jesus of the Bible, and that the Jesus of America is...well..oftentimes just the Jesus of America.This book will get you thinking about your favorite motif for Jesus: effeminate androgyny, masculine prize fighter, black moses, white mormon elder brother, or hippie love freak. It will also get you to thinking about how all of your motifs combined still can't measure up to the Man-God."
4,Very interesting book.,"A little depressing for me, given that I am an Orthodox Christian, but an important study nonetheless. Well-written and well-researched."
5,Jesus For The Rest Of Us,"Smart, funny, irreverent. Finally a religion book that doesn't assume its readers are all religious!"
5,"So clever that Barnes & Noble picks as a ""future bestseller""","This book is classy, and informative. I was surprised that Warren Buffett, Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Michael Armstrong, and Sam Donaldson each gave the book ""five stars"" and lavish praise. I had never seen them give a book any blurb, let alone ones so effusive. Miramax, producer of ""Shakespeare in Love,"" won seven Oscars for that movie. Now that it published ""Shakespeare in Charge,"" it deserves seven similar awards for this book. I agree with B&N. This is headed for the bestseller list, and really should be there."
5,Moog Control Arms,"As expected, Moog quality still rocks!!! I wouldn't use anything else. Quality bushings, quality, heavy duty boot, and a zerk fitting for servicing. The best!"
4,At her peak!,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# 70710-88054-2, Playing Time: 60:54The KBFH treats us this time with another great concert! This weekly radio show covered a lot of ground (both musically and geographically) to bring great music to radio listeners.As usual, the recording quality is superb. Pat and her band were recorded during the fall of 1981 in support of the ""Precious Time"" album. The versions are interesting, and you can hear a 10-minute rendition of ""In The Heat Of The Night"".The line-up at the time still included Scott Sheets as a second guitarist, so that Pat's hubby Neil can stretch out. Pat's voice is in top shape, and the track selection couldn't be better.This is a GREAT live album; all her others, though generally good, pale in comparison. A great mixture of power and feeling!"
3,Another boring textbook,It's like nearly every textbook I've had to purchase - boring - puts me to sleep trying to read it - costs WAY too much - at least the chapters are short.
2,boring,"This is a horribly hard book to labor through in my opinion. It was required for a graduate level class in my M.S. Instructional Design and Technology class and it was horrible to read. It is boring, written terribly, and a labor to get through. I fell asleep over and over trying to get through it. There was little to no creativity applied to the transference of this information. It is not even very well organized. I actually read the whole thing, as a requirement, but I got almost nothing from it. I cannot recommend this book in good faith to anyone."
4,quick delviery,this a great reference book regarding design and instructional technology. I constantly use it with other books as a refresher when applying new design theories.
3,Has Some Great Education References but Hard to Find Topics in the Index,"I kept this book because it has some great educational references that I will be able to use in my doctoral program, but I am currently writing an instructional design assessment paper & can't easily find any subject matter topics in the index. That makes for some real frustation. Would I buy the book again? Yes, because I will be able to use it for theory courses, but as a general reference text no.Carol P. Doctoral Student"
4,Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology,My order was here before I knew it and in great shape for less than half the price in the college book store.
5,I was hooked to this book,Being a German Jew it really showed me how lucky I am to be here it really made me think. When you are reading it seems so real and like you are one of the characters. It also made me aware of how people can have amazing careers after having such a tough childhood. This is such a great book I can not wait tell I read the squel to it.
4,This book is great,this book is great! the only part I did not like was the change of languages after the move to france. (they did not write the rest of the book in French but simple words like:oui.)I think everyone interested in the Holocaust should read this book.
5,"I loved this book, and couldn't put it down!!!","I listened to the sound recording of When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, and found it wonderfully funny, exhausting, sad, happy, anxious, and cheering all at once. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with knowledge of WW2, and even people who don't. I can't belive the children learnt French so quickly. I wish there was a sequel, I would dearly love to find out what happens to them in England"
4,Anna wanted a difficult childhood,"I read this book when I was barely older than Anna, and read it again when my boys were her age. Anna wants to be a writer, and has heard that a writer must have a difficult childhood. Early on, she and her brother are allowed to choose one toy apiece to leave home with. Instead of her beloved Pink Rabbit, she chooses a brand-new stuffed toy. This decision is deeply regretted because the new one has no personality, and she deeply misses the comfort of her battered old toy. In the end, the plot is as predictable as one of her brother's language exercises, but much more satisfying.I think Lee Child must have read this book too, because remembering Pink Rabbit made the adumbrations in one of his Reacher books starkly obvious."
3,When hitler stol pink rabbit,I read the book for a history class.It was a purty good book it din't have mutch to do whit the hallucost. It was mostly about the little girland her family and how she was up sat becuse she dint gate to grow up like se wanted to in gurrmany and whit her pink rabbit and her freands.So i found it guit boring.
3,A THUMB UP,I think that the book was not a real intrest to me. The book didn't talk much about the war it mostly talked about how Anna and her family ecscaped form Hitler to other countries. There wasen't much talk about the war.
2,Pink Rabbit,"The book When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is a book about a little girl that had to move because she was a Jew when Hitler came to power. This book is kind of a boring book, but interesting all the same. I would reccomend it to people 10-12 years old."
4,This is NOT an adult book,"I was so surprised to see adults giving this book a two or one star judgement because they found it under their level that I simply have to state clearly: this book is not an adult book and was never meant to be. It describes the Horrors of Nazi Germany in the eyes of a child written for children.Anna experiences her deportation as more of an adventure than a real tragedy, however, the awful reality is always present. With this true story, children in terms suitable for 10 to 12 year olds can learn about awful times which are ... unfortunatley .. repeated manifold all over the world nowadays.I am a 41 year old German, when I was 10 this was mandatory reading for us. Never did I imagine it was meant for adults, never did I imagine the Holocaust less horrible than it was just because this book takes the topic on gently."
3,The best/only book I'v read that I didn't want to.,"I'm brad and I though that the story was very well and I think it help todays society in alot of ways. It teaches us how predust can ruin a perfectly good society. It also tells us how a country can be totaly turned against itself. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in the second world war. But I warn you don't read it all in one day, Then the next day you will miss the emotions that came rushing out of the page."
1,"Yes, this book exists........and most tabs are terrible","Being a HUGE Black Crowes fan, and a hobby guitar player, I went on a determined hunt for this tab book. I found it on eBay & was delighted to win.......that is, until I started sitting down to learn the songs only to quickly determine that the tabs are poorly written, in the wrong tuning, and even capoed at the wrong fret. Sting Me, for example is tabbed out with both guitar parts for one guitar. Remedy is supposed to be played in Open G, but the book tabs the song in standard E tuning. Thorn in my Pride is supposed to be capoed at the 4th fret, but the book scores the song with the capo at the 2nd fret. This book is going back on eBay! Better, more accurate tablature is available on the internet, and live performances on YouTube help to back up the tabs."
4,Little black [crowes] book,"I didn't really know that this was available commercially, and I still have my doubts if you can really get your hands on this unless otherwise recieved as a promo like I did. Here's what it's all about, in case you never get your hands on one of these. It comprises of commentary from both Robinson brothers (though mostly from Chris) about topics of ""SOuthern HArmony and Musical Companion"" LP such as the Black Crowes,recording the album, touring, overnight success, and the brothers themselves. Also wraps up with mini transcription for nine of the original songs on the album. Good luck trying to locate via Amazon. Best bet is to check out record shops. I have no idea how many were made or how much one is worth, but it is some damn fine memoribilia, printed in apparently Chris Robinson's handwriting. Not a MUST HAVE, it seems more like a promotional type of material."
3,satisfied,"Ordered a2 Jumbo but still thought it was little small for my long, thick hair. I slept with the rollers on and my hair looked naturally curly in the morning. I slept comfortably with them all over my hair. Might not be the sturdy ones that lasts long, but it works ."
2,cheap,"They're not good for sleeping. They fall out easy and like others said, you have to keep snapping them back together when you're setting your hair. I wouldn't buy this brand again."
4,enchanting!,"This book was fun, lightly suspenseful and magical. I could really relate to the characters. Very nice!"
4,Horns galore!!! By Ashlie,"The magic has drawn you to this book! In this book Song of the Unicorns, by Rachel Roberts, there are three girls who have magical gems and powers. Adrian is fearless and brave. Emily is happy-going and caring. Kara is the drama-queen.The book starts out in New Mexico. In this book the three mages find baby unicorns. The unicorns grow their horns and become more magical. But an evil warrior comes to steal the unicorns' newly attained magic. The unicorns, helpless with out their magic, will surly not survive, or will they? Read the book to find out. In my opinion this book is thrilling. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is full of magical action. If you like fantasy, you will love this book. I myself think this book is perfect. The book is absolutely thrilling!"
5,Best book yet in the series!!!,This book is Awesome!! This book totally deserves 100 stars. Emily invites her friends with her Colrado to visit her dad thouh she tries to get along with her step mother. Anyways she then finds these baby unicorns and quickly has to send them to Dalrida before somebody else will capture them first. U must read this book it is awesome and you won't regret it.
3,Plastic face,This was high on my son's Christmas list but unfortunately the plastic face scratched the very first week making it hard to read. A much more durable face is needed to be considered a sports watch. He was not even playing a sport when it was easily scratched.
4,A Nice Nike Watch,I am so happy to get purchase this beautiful watch! There is only something wrong! the band material is veryyyy fragil so you have to take care of it everytime!
5,Excellent continuation...,"I bought Dan Woog's Jocks a few years ago, and after a few of the reads posted a 5-star review of it. And I give this book the same review. It is an excellent insight into the competitive world of sport, and how so many athletes suffer.Being someone who loves more of the less-known sports, I found the inclusion of those kinds of sports very welcome. They give me valuable insight into how those sports have a slightly different view of things, but still have the same problems.A definite thumbs up."
4,Last of the Breed,"I was never a great Ray Price fan, however after watching him Willie and Merle on this great concert DVD I have to say that at 80+ his voice is as strong as ever. Great opportunity to see these three true legends of country music and terrific backing from Asleep at the Wheel."
3,Gave as gift,I gave this item as a gift. Got no feedback from recipient. I know it was a good concert. I saw excerpts on Youtube. I just don't know about the quality of this video since I've not seen it. Not sure how to rate it. Went in the middle. Could be a 5 star.
5,the last of the breed,this is the best you get 3 great singer on one DVD Merle Haggard. Willie Nelson and Ray price
5,Classic,This is a three-in-one classic performance. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys any one of the three performers.
4,Liked it,"Good quality, good sound, was a gift for my husband and he loves it. The CD is also good quality."
5,Perdition House,"Kathryn Wall is destined to become one of the great mystery writers of our time. I've gotten so I can hardly wait for the next Bay Tanner adventure to hit the stands. Unlike some popular female sleuths, Bay is no ditz, no wilting violet looking up beneath her lashes to glean her clues from some macho male. She's sexy, funny, gutsy, and savvy--the kind of woman you'd love to have as a best friend. Bay Tanner makes me laugh out loud, a rare and delightful treat. And Wall's skilled plotting and scintillating prose keeps me turning pages. I think her latest episode with her arrant ""distant cousin,"" Mercer Prescott,is her best work yet."
5,Southern Author,"I recently discovered this author and am enjoying very much her mystery books!As both some of my paternal AND my maternal ancestors were originally fromthe Carolinas, I am really enjoying the opportunity to read the books bythis native of South Carolina.I am looking forward to reading more books by the author.And I have one other comment and that is the struggle, the main character,Bay is having breaking her smoking habit as I, too, am trying very hardto end the nasty habit!!! Never thougth I would find a book writtenso recently in which the major character would be constantly trying tobreak that habit!!!"
4,This was an excellent reader,"I was appropriately brutal in my review of ""Judas Island"" and after reading that one, I let ""Perdition House"" lie around for a few months. I was pleasantly suprised at this book. It was exactly what I look for in crime mysteries. It was complicated with mysterious characters and our lead character was focused. There was merely a smattering of that simpering murdered husband blues routine (that was like a Dr. Phil miniseries in Judas), and the tedium of romantic, foreign pursuits was held to a minumum. Bravo, this was a solid crime novel. Very well orchestrated plot, crime, bad guys, and the mysterious victims added a nice flavor to the composition."
3,"Handler taking a different, more serious turn","Did David Handler tire of Stewart Hoag, wry bon vivant and tireless investigator? Or is he just trying to expand the number of franchises? Whatever the reason for abandoning Hoag and picking up a new detective duo -- film critic Mitch Berger and trooper Des Mitry -- this introduction leaves us all a little sorry not to have Stewart swaggering around New York and its smart spots. Setting is important to mysteries and while the Connecticut coast serves, it doesn't sizzle the way Handler's earlier books do; no matter how tepid the plot the characters were always wonderfully eccentric. ""Blue Blood"" makes me curious about the second Berger mystery, but also hopeful that Hoag is only on hiatus, not abandoned."
