5,Love this book,"This is a wonderful book. Being a fan of Carole's it's a fresh breath of air knowing that no matter where you came from or where you end up, we all go through hard times. She's one tough cookie. I'm forever a fan."
4,Touching memoir,"Carole Radziwill is a gifted writer. I must admit I ordered the book because of her appearance on Bravo'sReal Housewives. I knew it would be interesting; I did not expect it to be moving, insightful and ""soul baring."" I am looking forward to the publication of her novel. And it confirmed what I expected, Carole is someone I would like to have as a friend."
4,best written book I think I have ever read!!,"This is such an amazing tale of love & loss. Carole writes so well, and so descriptively, that you feel you are there with her; during her childhood of fun-filled summer vacations, when her husband gets diagnosed, and the way she tells of the night that John & Carolyn's plane goes down, it just broke my heart. I think Carole is a strong woman, surviving that summer. Fully recommend this book."
4,Nicely Written,"The book is more of a tragedy than anything. It explains Carole R.'s hardship in losing a husband and then a friend at nearly the same time. It would be interesting if she continued the book, explaining how she made it through this time and back on her own."
3,Cashing in on the Kennedy name it seems,"A good read but not a great one. Frankly, I liked reading about the author's early somewhat unorthodox upbringing than her link with the Kennedy clan. But then again, I never was a big fan of any of the Kennedys."
2,Just okay!,It is okay when you are looking for something to read. It really didnt hold my attention. Started and stopped multiple times.
1,Depressing,"I received this book for Christmas. While the author is good with ""words"", the book was the most depressing thing I think I have ever read. It was so hard to get thru the book. I am still trying to figure out what the title ""What Remains "" really means. Very little is said of the impact it had on her mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Once she marries ""the prince,"" (and what was he prince of?) very little, if any, is written about her own family. It's all about her and Carolyn Bessette. Carole is very caught up with the monied set of The Hamptons and all the glitz and glamour that goes with it.When she married the Prince, she knew he had cancer. She made that choice. But while reading the book, I got the feeling his health issues were a tremendous burden on her. That she would rather be shopping and hanging out with Carolyn.Don't waste your money on this book. This was written by a very selfish, self-centered gal."
2,depressing and boring,"There was nothing remaining at the end. The book just ended. It this hadn't been about John Kennedy, Jr., no one would have read it. You would think Carole didn't actually live these events because she opened up about nothing. What took her so long to write such a boring book?Oh, I just saw a video no Bravo where Carole admits that smoking pot is her hobby. That's why it took her so long to write such a dull book."
1,Could not get through the first few pages. Uugghh.,"The author is so self-absorbed one wonders how this book managed to get published. It is vacuous blither-blather. Read it if you like to feel nauseated. This woman is deceptive in her role on Real Housewives of New York City, always playing: ""Miss Switzerland, Ms. Whatever, nothing bothers me."" BS. She is calculating, attention seeking and dangerously ANOREXIC. Nice role model you are putting out there for the the many woman, young and old, who watch the show. I enjoy it when Countess LuAnn, calls you out on your nonsense. Let poor Russ go and find a whole woman. Go get a bleach-blonde, anorexic, social climbing, lesbian, ice-queen since that appears that is what you are really into. Oh, and George Clooney, ha ha. Funny. What you call ""dating"" he calls getting a little here and there. Get an authentic life and quit riding on people's coat-tails. You should be ashamed of yourself. You need a spiritual spanking."
2,way too depressing,"I had to stop reading this book about mid way through. I know of her tragedies, but then she talked about someone's head being chopped off as a child, then more tragedy. I was hoping to find some light somewhere, but it just got darker and darker."
3,Scattered and depressing,"Was hoping that even though a sad story that there would be a point, something to draw from. Never happened. The story is about tragedy from beginning to end and nothing to shed light on lessons learned, just her story. Almost as if te book was written just as her diary. She often speaks of her growing tired of her sick husband and that only turned me off to the whole book."
2,Disappointed,"From all the hype of the positive reviews I was expecting so much more. I have sympathy for the writer's loss of both spouse and friends. The book lost my attention quite a bit. I felt she did take some veiled swipes at Caroline Kennedy and also Daryl Hannah and that it was unnecessary. I didn't come away marveling at any deep relationships or any lessons learned. If there were any depth to the people she was writing about, unfortunately, I didn't see it in this book."
3,is a good book,"Is a good book, a little boring some times but in general I was expecting to know more about her feelings of having a husband so young and going to die and the fact that she didn't say much about losing her friend either."
1,"Yawn,","The story of a shrewd climber at work and through marriage, this memoir lacks true emotion. What the book does provide are small poorly-written stories about what it's like inside this famous family. Unflattering depictions of many family members seem more the point, while the author depicts her marriage in hollow, non-verbal, love-less terms. If any emotion is conveyed it arises when she describes the ""complete"" JFK Jr. It sounds like her marriage lacked depth and passion and she more valued her access to Carolyn B. and JFK Jr. An example of the bratiness inherent in these two women who married powerful but distant men is seen in their ""game"" of imagining their ""townhouse"" life far away from the men they married and the controlled situation they chose over true love and happiness. Sad book in that the family members she skewers are still alive to read it."
2,Um...its okay...I guess...,I had read an excert from this book in a magazine and was cativated by the story enough to get the whole book. I should have stuck with the magazine. The writing seems to drift around pointlessly sometimes and there seems to be a lack of strong emotion in such an emotional story. The glaring name/status dropping is kind of funny but over all it was kind of dull and simply an okay read. Check it out from the library but don't buy it.
1,written too soon??,"I found most of this book to be poorly written. The beginning chapters review her life in elaborate, pointless detail. The memoir picks up somewhat as we are introduced to her life as a married woman and her friendship with Carolyn Bisset/John Kennedy. I believe this may have been hastily written as it lacks insight and merely reports events. This reader doesn't sense she has made peace with these tragedies and or grown as an individual."
2,Its chilly for a memoir,"After reading the not so warm reviews on this book I decided to give it a try. Who wouldn't be more in tune to write a deep recount of the relations between four public faces then the most public relations expert of them all? I found the book colder then the ice water I was sipping. How shallow and unemotional this was. One of the tabloids could've written a more emotional recount then Ms. Radziwill. I cried at the scene when she recounts her husband's death but it wasn't tears over her words, yet lack of them. ""I laid with him for days and then his heart stopped"" gets to the point but not to the heart (no pun intended). If you want a quick, short facts on what occurred between these two couples then this is your book. If you want an emotional read that makes you feel as if you were part of some in depth, public moments you will not be fulfilled by this selfish journal."
4,The strength in what remains behind,"The lives and personalities of JFK, Jr. and Carolyn, his seemingly aloof and proper wife, are unveiled in this memoir by the young wife of Anthony Radziwell, John's cousin and good friend. That someone in such a unique position, who also is a talented writer and journalist in her own right, opens this door into such well-guarded and intimate histories was enough to pique my interest in the first place. That this is also the chronicle of Anthony Radziwell's slow decline in health beginning with the ""bump"" that Carole detects under the skin of her robust and fun-loving groom as they lie on a beach enjoying their honeymoon gives this book a double focus amid the sort of slow-grinding coincidence that happens in life but could not be tolerated in good fiction. This was as fascinating read, the best recent memoir I have read, and a candid and touching look into the lives of these four vibrant cousins."
4,A story of love and friendship,It was well written and provided insights to some very famous people who died tragic deaths. It was respectful of the deceased vs a sensational tell-all type book.
5,Touching memoir,"What Remains surprised me by its depth, sensitivity and the feeling that she (the author) had no problem protecting the privacy and memories of Anthony, John Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. If you want a ""tell all"", don't buy this. But if you want a memoir of the lives and deaths of her beloved husband and friends, buy it for sure. Carole Radziwill could have told a lot about Jackie Kennedy's life and death, of her mother-in-law Lee and Caroline Kennedy and her family. Carole is a classy woman and this is a wonderful book.K. Collins"
1,what Remainscancellrd Review,Unable to review as this book is not in my Kindle. I really thought I had canceled this one after I ordered it. Nancy Gilliam
1,Selling the last shopworn flyblown stuff in the (back) window,"Here's some sentimental celebrity-mongering for you. Forty years later, in a different world, we STILL get to hear about this family, or rather, some random person's tenuous connections this family. Plenty of stuff about merely personal rubbish, blown into the realm of the heroic and mythic by its association with the grinning prince who rode into the Presidency on the basis of his association with Joe McCarthy and by calling Richard Milhous Nixon soft on Communism, the same shouting and posturing dude who nearly got us all blown up over Cuba. Hasn't this rich clown been totally de-constructed yet?Well, the romantic element can still claim its own: the bigger and more rip-roaring the man the greater his appeal for certain types. And then we have the nostalgia element.Hey, do you know anybody who knows anybody who saw this guy in a parade, or went drinking with someone who was related to someone who married into the family?"
5,Real Politik.u is not true,"Carolyn Bessette Kennedy is ballet. She is swan u. This is something very serious about her. The only man ever in bed with her is her engagee, the King of Sweden, France and Lithuania. He is also JFK jr, who is her older third cousin. This book is many dilettant.u industrialu. The book is part of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's Sorbonne degru. The dates that you see surrounding her and John Kennedy Stie are skein. They are cyclu. They are also both still alive. The plane crashed, but he knows how to fly. The sky divides. This is her ""water lie."" They are amazing and disturbing and you listen to much wallowing. This book was actually stolen out of my purse."
1,Halloween Fright Night a ...,"The Real Deal is called ""Halloween Night"", and ""Halloween Night-Haunted House"". ... but not the quality of the real deal. Don't be fooled, get ""Halloween Night"" and turn your home into a Haunted House this Halloween."
2,A good start,This book offers simple solutions that may help parents of children with straightforward eating problems. It does not reflect the potential complexity of these problems and is unlikely to offer support to those with the most serious problems
3,Not really helpful for young children,"This book mostly provides an overview of different reasons your child may have food aversions to help you understand the child better. Towards the end of the book, it provides lots of activities and games to play with your child, however, these are only for pre-school and school aged children, not for a 2-year old child. So, the book is a good overview of the various possible reasons why a child may have food aversions, but if you have a really young child, the suggested activities are way too early for a 2-year old to engage in."
3,Disappointed with the book.,"This book is probably an excellent resource for children with various medical and developmental issues; however, I found it disappointing for my situation. My son is a healthy, normally developing 6 year old child in every aspect except eating. I was disappointed that the book did not offer ideas for expanding his foods beyond providing new foods with ones he likes at mealtime."
5,A terrific solutions guide for helping kids with food aversions and challenging eating behaviors,"This book came highly recommended to me by a friend who works with children who have a variety of different special needs. She pointed out that it picks up where a lot of books about eating challenges and ""picky eating"" behaviors leave off, dealing with the child whose food repertoire may consist of two or three foods; and who may be facing significant physical/behavioral or other challenges that interfere with the process of eating.I was immediately impressed by the book because it was so detailed and solutions-oriented. Not only do the authors present practical tips, ideas, and solutions that apply to specific situations: they include case studies that show how families can apply them. The book also includes helpful illustrations designed to help parents understand the postural control and other body exercises that are explained in the text. Highly recommended."
2,Disorganized but some good information,"This book has good information, but the format is very hard to follow. With the help of a good editor, I think the authors have valuable things to share that could benefit parents and professionals working with children who have feeding difficulties. The format alone made me close the book after 20 minutes and return it to Amazon. Too bad, because the authors have a lot of experience with putting these ideas into practice with real-life children."
4,Great quality and wonderful value!,"I decided to remodel my bathroom not too long ago. When it came to purchasing new towel racks I had no idea that there were so many manufacturers to choose from, but I knew that I did not want my bathroom accessories costing more than my bathtub! I ended up going with Gatco because they make quality products that don't cost an arm and a leg. I highly recommend this."
3,you get what you pay for,got this towel rack at a great price... easy to install and looks great. very lightweight and i wouldn't advise letting kids pull on it.
3,Sport Seat Review,I felt like the seat was a little different then what was pictured and I not sure about the weight capacity. I weigh 225 lbs and the seat has more fluctuation than I would like to see. I will report back to let you know how long it lasted under normal usage.
3,False Advertising,"This chair is what it appears to be, an ordinary portable seat. The claim that it holds 1200 lbs is bogus. It is clearly marked on the bottom of the seat that it is rated at 250lbs... same as most other portable chairs. I weigh over 300lbs, and while I can sit on this thing, it's very rickety, and feels like it will break at any moment. You might get a 1200lb block to sit on this thing, but in the real world it wouldn't last a day."
2,Old maps,I bought the Garmin 2720 after returning my Tom Tom 910 in the year 2006.This should serve as a caution to most new buyersIt has very old set of maps.. maps that maybe date back to the year 2001.I stay in central new jersey and there has been a lot of new construction around but the maps dont reflect thoseI would believe that the latest update is available for download on their website and it costs about $75. but i think this is a rip off because if you buy this product in 2006 then you should get the latest maps with itOtherwise the product is good.I would prefer a faster startup time.Takes some time to get the satellite connection as does the Tom Tom 910
1,Rather use a Map - horrible design flaws,Looks and functions really well until the mount sporadically fails to connect / charge the unit.The connections are on the mount and the unit to mount connections are awful.There are much better GPS on the market - I went with the Garmin 2820 unit after a month of conversations with TomTom. Talk about BAD service and support - save yourself A Lot of trouble.
3,TomTom GO 910 GPS,"The GO 910 is amazing- it seems to operate perfectly. However, it's hard to discern the performance, as the documentation is, to be charitable, sorely lacking. It is also next to impossible to get in touch with anyone at TomTom by telephone.The TomTom Home software caused serious problems on my MacIntosh, and I had to remove it. In addition to a serious conflict with iTunes, the program insisted on opening at every startup, and this could not be corrected with preferences.In short, what seems to be an excellent product is hampered by lousy support."
3,Needs improvement for the price!!!,"Other than having to use the reset button after charging and the very flimsy windshield mount, it does very well. The windshield mount is in big...big...need of replacement with a much improved mount that actually will allow you to charge with the car plug."
1,Not good,I bought a used one in July from ExpressMedia. It's really bad. It often starts up by itself and draws out battery. Sometime it can not start at all and need reset. This is my first GPS but it gave me really bad experience.
1,TomTom 910,"This is my forth GPS. The mapping has many errors and I've sent corrections back to the company. But they want more money to get updated software. The routing is poor, such as making a left turn, drive up a hill, then turn right to go down the hill whereas the best route is to turn right on level ground then left to get to the same point and on better streets. There are better units at a lower cost."
1,Was that DumbDumb or TomTom?!,"I purchased my DumbDumb 910(a.k.a. TomTom)in Aug. 2006 for way too much money. This is the biggest, clunkiest, most expensive-yet worthless, piece of crap I've ever bought. Do not waste your money on a frustrating piece of junk that has you literally driving in circles, freezes up, does not start up, takes forever to acquire a signal, and just shuts down for no reason at all. I am going to purchase one that costs much less and will be reliable! It would be satisfying to smash this thing."
2,Short battery life,"I've had my 910 for just over two years. Some time ago I noticed the battery charge wasn't lasting as long as when it was new. Pretty soon it wouldn't hold a charge at all and then wouldn't even operate when plugged into a power source. When I called the customer support, they seemed to know immediately the battery was shot. I will have to send it in for a repair. BTW, they won't ship to an APO address even though the unit was purchased from an APO address. I'll look at Garmin for my next navigator."
2,Disposable?,"I got a Tom Tom 910 for Christmas. I used it when I traveled out of town. I really loved it, but I put it away and didn't use it for a few months because I didn't go anywhere.When I needed it it wouldn't start. I reset it. I charged it. I reset it again. Called Tom Tom customer service. They made me reset and recharge and then told me the battery was dead. They said that I could return it for repair, and I asked how much would that cost. Answer - more than a new unit! I asked if I could buy a battery and they said the battery COULD NOT BE CHANGED!!!!!!!! So basically I used it a couple of dozen times and then threw it out.I won't buy another GPS that has a permanent battery."
3,"Basics Work, shame about the other ""Features""","Well, I love the product basically, as it seems to do what you want it to do, although the directions occasionally send you in a funny direction. But I seem to lose favourites, cannot create POIs, cannot change the opening wallpaper, and all the other bits which appear to be available but are not working. In all fairness to Tomtom support, who have been in regular contact with me, I have yet to get the damn things to work, so keep losing all the regular destinations I want to go to. Arrrrrrgghhhh. But the basics work really well, so altogether I am pleased with the purchase."
1,Nothing but a piece of garbage !,"The experience I had with TomTom 910 is nothing but frustrating. The first unit I had to return as it was dead on me. The second one, I am struggling to get it worked. It does not hold the time. Every time you turn it on it gives a different time from the last one. You need to set up the time always. They say there is a fix and I can not get one !. The Customer service of TomTom is one of the most inefficient one. Call them and you will be lucky to get a call back from their Level-2 in 3 to 4 days time. This is not waht you want when you spent $799.00. A $2.00 toy seems to be more relibale. They have a battery problem. Once over charged, it can even explode accoring to their Level-1 customer service. Never turns off when the ingnition key is turned off. Need to mannualy shut it off, which is not the way it should be !.In conclusion, this is a piece of JUNK to me so far. And not the one to spend $799.00 and get insulted !!!"
3,TomTom 910 - Packed with features but not user friendly,TomTom 910 is a nice GPS packed with features like MP3 and connetion to phone using bluetooth but not user friendly compared to Garmin.
1,are you kidding?,"What a junk!Can even start this thing.Don't buy it. Don't even consider this.Stay away from Tom Tom.It took me three hours to figure out, but failed to do so.So I'm returning it."
1,Works well but does not last long,"Works quite well but not durable at all. My tomtom died after 1 year and 1 month. Reset does not work. It just died.For the price, its not worth it.Never going to buy another tomtom again."
1,Poor Maps for the US,"US Maps woefully out of date with no updates forthcoming. They get all the interstates right....Secondary? HaHa....When they have updates, you get to buy them, then you find out what's on them. No way to tell ahead of time....be careful.....be very careful...The routing leaves a lot to be desired as well. Unit tends to favor main roads which are not always the ""shortest"" or the ""fastest"" route."
1,NEVER BUY A TOM TOM,"If you want a good product stay away from Tom Tom products. I have used 3 different products from tom tom and maybe I'm a slow learner or tom tom has bad products, just stay away from tom tom so many better gps units to buy that are better. Never plan to use an update. Takes 10 hours to download and if it is the right download goodluck. I bought a europe update and got a guam update and they stated NO REFUNDS. NEVER BUY A TOM TOM!!!"
1,buy a Garmin - save some money and frustration,"I got one of these pieces of junk for my birthday a year ago - I think it has worked a total of once. First, the mounting arm does not keep the product at an angle where it can be viewed. I contacted TomTom and they told me that my mounting arm was not part of a recall of mounting arms - so I had to buy a new one. I did - twice - neither worked. I called TomTom again and they told me that the mounting arm frequently malfunctioned when the temperature was over 80 degrees - I live in Texas - the temperature is over 80 degrees 6 months of the year.Next, I had to constantly restart the TomTom - it seemed to not like to work for more than a couple of hours at a time. Then, yesterday, I tried to restart it and nothing happened so I boxed the whole thing up (3 docking arms and all) and mailed it back to TomTom. Save your money - get a Garmin!"
1,Continuos lockups make this otherwise good product useless,No firmware upgrade but locks up every 2-3 uses. The reset feature is where it shines: they decided to make it hell forcing you to have a small paper clip at hand and start hoping this thing revives after a series of second counting and button pressing in the right sequence. TOTAL MADNESS in my opinion. I am today a happy owner of a NON TOM TOM navigator and will never go back to this brand. I had it. And pls don't get fooled by otherwise positive comments. This small problem makes the product a true nightmare.
1,Tomtom 910 is BAD,"Mine died when I was locally traveling. Imagine if I had relied on it when traveling out of state as I did in 2007! I will never go out of town without a Mapquest printout! It's scary to rely on this thing! It wont boot wont charge, nothing. I am just reading the other reviews and realizing how stupidly I have been relying on this for more than 6 months now!"
3,Do you like off-road routes?,"Overall the prodct is good. Beware of setting ""shortest distance"" if in the mountains. I was guided from the Interstate to a local highway, which turned into a gravel raod. The road deteriorated until it was fit only for off-road vehicles! True, it was the shortest route. I prefer staying on pavement!"
1,USB Issues (PC BIOS corruption) Made Me Too Leery,"Every time the TomTom 910 is connected (USB) to my PC it corrupts my PC's BIOS. Spent quite some time understanding what was happening (w/Dell Tech Support). Subsequently, I then spent >1 hr. with TomTom Customer Service only to be told that I need to call back on Monday for Tech Support.I had read the comments relative to problems buyers were having with this unit, but it is the only unit I am aware of that comes preloaded with maps of Europe (I'm traveling to Germany in a month). So I decided to give it a try, but this experience left me very leery relative to the reliability of this product. Guess I'll be using a map in Germany."
2,Great potential.,This was a very nice unit until I updated the software. That seems to have caused the TomTom to freeze. I couldn't turn off the unit unless I used the reset button. Turning it back on only brought me to the title page. I did get an RA # from First Street Photo and the gps is on its way back for replacement. I don't know if I'll ever update my TomTom again. The AC recharger cord pops out too easily also.
3,TomTom 910 Support,"The TomTom 810 works as advertised. Although the screen size is small by comparison to built-ins it's usually easy to find a spot where it will be easily seen. The windshield mount is clumsy and of little use in places such as California where it's against the law to have windshield mounted devices. There has to be a better way to mount this unit without erecting a complicated permanent structure. Support for the TomTom is from the Netherlands and I've been waiting over 6 weeks for updated maps ordered from the TomTom store. If they are going to do business in the USA they need to provide a better product/accessory delivery system. Also, many of the software mapping features, such as radar camera sites, are not available in the U.S. which emphasizes that TomTom is a European company first with the USA being a source of revenue without thought or expense."
1,Not up to the hype,"I have never owned a GPS before so I did hours of research before choosing the Tom Tom 910. I guess I just thought I'd get lucky and avoid one with a bad bracket. Unfortunately, by about the 4th day it was tilting down as predicted. Also, as a first time user, I did not find the product to be particularly easy to learn and found many of the much anticipated features required a subscription or other unexpected expense."
1,Let me down badly (Garbage),"I bought the 910 last May. I was traveling in MA when the tom tom quit working. No mattter what I did it simply decided not to work. My trip was ruined to the lack of navigation. So do not trust Tom Tom 910. Called their service, very poor answers and now they want me to send the machine to the east coast at my expense for a turn around time of one month. Buyer beaware!!!"
3,Mixed Review,"This is probably one of the finest units on the market today. That said it has serious problems with freezing up and the instruction manuals that come with the unit are worthless at best! If you are into GPS as I am, it is a unit that you want to love but just have mixed feelings in that the it has some really bothersome problems."
1,TOM TOM is a NO NO,"I've owned this product a mere two weeks and after just 2 uses it fell apart. The screen froze and couldn't be turned off, causing it to overheat which than caused the screen to crack when touched. To make matters worse the company refused to replace or fix a clearly defective model and wanted to charge an ADDITIONAL $500 to fix. So if you've got the money to throw away and want to invest in a product that even its own producers won't stand by, by all means purchase it."
1,TomTom GO 910,I did not like this device at all. The device got me lost 3 days in a row and could not recalculate properly. After I returned this device I purchased a Garmin 660 and it ROCKs! I would not recommend the GPS to anyone who needs a reliable device.
4,Tomtom Go,"Love our Tomtom. Unfortunately, have lost our owner's manual. Anybody know how we can get one? Thanks."
1,Fraud,"One day and the windshield mount kit broke. Not all the features announced were included in my unit and I am still waiting for an answer from the dealer or TomTom. And finally, the best: after 15 days it switched off and it is still in a coma. No way to come it back to life again. I cannot remember a similar experience in my life as a consumer. Try it if you have the guts!"
3,the Tom Tom Go 910 is good but it needs work,"After two weeks of experience in Idaho and Florida a navigation device like this is a wonderful assistant to have in the car. As a navigation aid it is hard to imagine anything better. BUT, the instructions are poor, the software that comes with the instrument (I'm talking of the OSMac software) is extremely slow. And finally there is a complete reset sequence together with another Tom Tom Clear software product that is necessary when the machine freezes. This has happened to me four times in two weeks - which seems excessive. Phone customer service is good: email customer service was very slow in responding."
4,Good for those who are lost all the time...,"If you need to get someone something that will help them find their way and their not so good at reading a Mapsco then this is the right choice. It comes with several handy features like bluetooth speakerphone, it reads the name of the next street not just how far, it can hold music and pictures, and it works well at night. the only draw backs I have found so far is that the day display can get glare from the sun preventing clear view, the plug in to the cd/radio to have the sound come thru the car speakers is a little difficult or non-existant depending on your car stereo, the extended microphone doesn't really help unless it's next to your mouth, and after a few bumps the gps likes to start facing downward."
5,wonderful in Europe,"We used TomTom Go910 in England, Belgium and France. It was wonderful!!! Wouldn't travel without it."
4,Much better than expected,"I was pleasently surprised after using this unit. I read some horror stories from some reviewers after I had already orderded it and even thought about cancelling.All you have to do is read the manual (which is short and concise) before you start and you should have absoloutly no problems.I read some reviews which complained of shoddy construction. Not true!The maps that shipped with the unit are working great although they are shipping the newest maps to me for free.For anyone that does any travelling in Europe, this GPS comes pre-loaded with all of the European maps as well as Canada and the US."
5,"Great, Just great...!","I have been using this device for 2 nearly 2 months now and have travelled accross several states. This is a ""no brainer"" and gives you a secure & relax driving. I also travelled to Europe (Brussels, Toulouse, French Riviera and places in the middle of nowhere...) My Tom Tom got me there. I just had to select a European MAP and wait for the satellites to locate me. Just wished the satellites could find me faster. It takes approx. 20 mins before you can start driving! Else this is really worth the expense!"
1,DON'T BUY IT !!,"I ordered it from Pavilion Electronics through Amazon.It was shipped on time and I did recieve it in just a few days.Straight out of the box the Tom Tom had software problems.Tom Tom support did get it running after several phone calls and a couple of downloads. However, I soon discovered the maps were old and had lots and lots of errors. Support told me that new maps for 2007 might be available by December or January 2008 and I would have to pay for the update.This thing was junk, and there is no way I would by another Tom Tom, and after signing on to Tom Tom for possible updates and such, I now get TONS OF JUNK E-MAIL from everyone.I sent it back to Pavilion Electronics and did get a refund for the Tom Tom, but I had to pay for all the shipping costs."
4,Tom Tom works works,Tom Tom is fun and easy to use. I like that it can be used in USA and Europe. It would be better if there was an easy out button when you want to make changes.
1,TomTom,"I have a TomTom 910 that I bought in Belgium. I had it for about a week before it took a hard crash and had to be reloaded by the manufacturer. That repair took 7 weeks. After coming back to the U.S. and trying to use my navigator, it went berserk trying to figure out where in Europe we were. During the reload process all of the U.S. maps were deleted by the manufacturer and never re installed. I would not recommend buying a TomTom. Get a Garmin or a smartphone with Google maps."
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,"Please be very aware. If you buy this product and it has been sitting on the shelves of the vendors for over 6-7 months, then good luck. TomTom Customer service refused to provide me with map updates for Northern America (or even my local area) and I just had this product for 9 months only. They insisted that I need to buy the $150 map update.I highly do not recommend this at all. If I had known this is going to happen, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Problems with GO 910 from day 2,"Unit worked beautifully until I tried to download mp3 files to it. Without any error messages on either on the computer or on the unit, my GO 910 froze and remains frozen, showing nothing but the image of the unit on the screen when I turn it. I cannot shut it off, unless I hit the tiny reset button on the back. TomTom customer service tried, but was unable to help (mediocre service quality and product knowledge). Required to mail it back to retailer after receipt of RMA and wait (for weeks?) for new unit.Summary: Go 910 has losts of functions but its software appears to be very fickle. Wall charger connector is too loose and it requires patience to keep the green power light.Think twice about getting this unit."
2,Maps are terrible,"I own this unit plus a Magellan 700 updated to a 760 (with the latest maps) I put the two side by side and tested it from Georgia to Michigan. The TomTom maps are Ok, but they took me miles out of my way and did not have streets on it that have been in existence for about 5 years.I tested it locally in North Georgia, same thing routes took me miles out of my way and they were about 200 yards off at my final destination. The Magellan was spot on to 3 or 4 feet. I really like the 3d view that TomTom has plus the Audio Books that you can download and listen to. But if you cant trust the maps what good are they?Bottom line is I am selling my TomTom 910 and getting a Magellan 6000T. I know I will take a bath on it but it is worth it in my opinion."
3,TomTom GO 910,"Started having display problems from day 2....flashing and cycling between day and night. Need to use it for the time being, but will have to return it for replacement. Maps are a little out dated but lots of freeway construction in the Houston area. Haven't had any tracking problems and the re-route feature is great. Had to fool the unit into letting me use an alternate route to get to my lake house. Added favoties to navigate to. Not all addresses are defined with the correct cities. Post office info should be a requirement for map builders. Found it hard to communicate mapping problems to manufacturer."
5,TomTom Rocks,"I have to say I was concerened about buying this unit with all of the issues I have read about the mount problems. So far I have not had any issues and the Navigation part of the unit is wonderful. In california it is illegal to mount the unit to the windshield so I am waiting for an alternative mount to be available , so far on yet. But honestly I am very happy with the product and compared to my buddy's NUvi and other Garmin handhel this is a better unit for what I wanted. Its also nice that you get everything ( remote, mount , cheesy bag, and all power cords)"
1,If only it worked.....,"I bought this with high expectations, and from the referral of a friend. It was GREAT for the first 3 or 4 uses, but now, it's stuck on the first screen, and ""locked up"" so to speak. I was on my way to Poland and it literally would not work no matter what I did. Being in Germany, I HAVE to have something reliable, and especially on my way to a 3rd world country, driving alone, and not speaking their language. Therefore, unable to stop and ask for directions. Thankfully, I was close to a base and able to buy another GPS... one that worked. I am returning the TomTom and have already replaced it with the Navigon. It has yet to fail me. Maybe I got a dud, or maybe that is the extent of the TomTom quality. By the way, Polish pottery shopping was great, thanks to the Navigon!"
2,Poor mount and customer service,"I live overseas in the Netherlands and have to have a GPS to get around. I puchased a Tom Tom 910, paid top dollar, and was expecting to get the best. 3 months later the mount breaks, so I took it back to the shop I bought it at and had it replaced (1yr warranty). 6 months later the new mount breaks. Took it back to the shop and they told me Tom Tom will not replace the mount because Tom Tom said I am taking it off the windshield incorrectly. They don't even know how I take it off the windshield, BUT I have consumer reports stating how defective there mounts are. This is an example of how a company is trying to save money when they built a crappy product. I would not suggest Tom Tom for this reason."
4,Good value for your money,This GPS has lots of features. 20GB hard drive is the best of all. This is the best GPS that's available on the market for this price. Reason for giving 4 star is coz of two reasons. Mounting is not that good. And the charging cable design is poor. It doesn't connect good. Falls of frequently.
3,It's so.. so..,"Eventhough I like the product, it lacked few options I would have liked such as voice recognition.Also, after about 2 weeks it broke down and I had to send it to get it repaired.I received a refurbished one from the factory since they could not fix the problem.other than that, I'm fine so i give it a so-so rating."
1,Product BAD straight out of box,"Bought as a birthday gift for girl friend and started to set up with her home address, then display went blank and now I have an expensive GPS unit that will not turn off and just displays a blue screen. Use cation when purchasing. I hope the customer service is better than the product."
4,Never get lost,"Easy, functional and a great helper.Never fight with your wife about directions, great mapping as well in as Europe,"
1,A bad choice,"I received this item in the mail today, and within 5 minutes of practice it broke from being swung in the air. It seems like it's also made of cheap wood instead of actual bamboo, so I don't know what these other guys got but I sure as heck got ripped off!"
4,Martial Arts Bo,"This bo was of a good quality and was delivered promply. Althouth I expected some variation, I was supprised that it looked nothing like the picture shown in the advertisement. The burn marks looked like a clover pattern burned over and over again on the bo. There were carvings on the bo like the pictured advertisement; however, it is difficult to see them past the burns, and there are no colored markings like it shows on the picture. Overall, it's still priced very well for it's quality."
3,Not a clear book to understand.,The explainations are lenghty. Need better organization of contents!
1,Typical Monson-Haefelian,"Warning: this book is only a rumination on the J2EE web services specification, fat on ""theory"" and with absolutely no real code examples you can run and play with to learn. Unless you are someone who can learn playing tennis looking at people playing it, or become a musician by listening to music, I doubt you can become a web services developer by just reading words and code snippets.As the author says: ""this book doesn't attempt to cover installation, configuration, or deployment except in terms of standard J2EE requirements"". I do believe that a decent tech book must have running code to support its explanations and support its value and usefulness. With this text Monson-Haefel is well on his way to win the ""Most useless java book of the year"" award."
2,Disappointing examples.,It's been enduring pain when I tested the code examples and it did'nt work on JBoss. The content looks a bit old and needs an update.
2,"Topic Well Covered, But Something's Missing","This is a very technical book, written by very technical people for other very technical people. It would never be considered light reading or adorn many coffee tables.The authors handle the various and diffuse material reasonably well, given that they are very technical people &c;, but at some point it begins to resemble a conclave of monks arguing about angels and needles, and the whole structure begins to resemble something by Rube Goldberg instead of a work well though out.It is a reasonably thorough book on this very technical subject, some 800+ pages of heavy lifting. From the vantage point of a company making investments that utilize technology, what the book is about strongly goes against Ockham's Razor. But if the simpler approach cannot or will not be adopted for any reason then this is a useful reference book that most, perhaps all, of the implementation consultants should have in their libraries."
2,No value for the money,"This book is not very promising for those want to build a real-world Web services architecture. This book repeats the tutorial of Sun's Java web services. The book completely forgot about how to make all components work together and lack content how to implement Web services from legacy J2EE components, Interoperability with .NET or other Web services solutions etc. I found the first 3 chapters and last 2 chapters does not make sense. Besides, the book is more typical and spends more content like the free Java tutorial download from Sun site. Where is the value ?"
3,Good coverage of individual topics but...,this really doesnt seem to help with real world implementation. I also found it boring just like some manual. When is HeadStart book on Webservices due!
5,Outstanding,J2EE Web Services by Richard Monson-Haefel ISBN: 0321146182: It is a very professional technical book that you can read serially (low page flipping factor). It is written in such a form that answers the questions as they come up as if the author had read your mind. No detail is left apart. It is one of those books that you read with passion longing for the next reading session.
5,starts fom the Basics...good guide for beginners,"just started reading it.easy to read ,has a good flow,clear explanation.i think it will be a good resource for my current web services project and if i take the certification exam too."
5,Great coverage of core J2EE Web Service technologies,"I find this book a great reference for the technologies central to developing Web Services on a J2EE platform. It focuses on the central technologies such as JAX-RPC and SAAJ. It does a great job in explaining how these work and how you can use them. You get answers to questions like how to handle SOAP attachments and SOAP headers in your applications, how MIME types are mapped to Java types etc.This book gives you the details."
5,Informative and Accurate,"This is a highly informative and accurate book. It presents the data in a clear and graphic form, with a minimum of statistical manipulation. The studies cited by the previous reviewer, Lloyd Rowsey, are based on econometric modeling. Since the one he mentions, two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results. One is by Ted Joyce, the other by John Lott and John Whitney. Econometric modeling can prove anything. If you want to understand crime in America in the 1990s, buy The Crime Drop."
3,Not a bad book,"This was a pretty good book. I enjoyed the story line and the characters. The leading man in this story is a bit over-the-top-caveman, but if you can overlook that, then you're probably not going to hate this book."
4,Nice start to a series,"I enjoyed this book and the characters in it, the challenges that they faced. To have one of the main characters face such struggles of belief, while at the same time fighting a murder case & an attraction stronger than he's ever dealt with, lets just say it draws you in to see where his attitude leads next. Trace is the typical Alpha male, in all ways, and it was quite fun watching him battle that tendency at times, with being loving & (trying) to be understanding of something he (had) no belief in. The book seemed fairly balanced in terms of story & character development, romance and all the challenges they faced along the way. At times it seemed as though the story hit slow points, where I kind of lost a bit of excitement in continuing, but on the whole it did not damage my enjoyment of the story. I look forward to reading the next in the series, as I have a feeling from reading this one that the characters to come will be even more exciting."
1,AWFUL,"After trudging more than halfway through this book, I am going to try and return it to Amazon. Or burn it.Let me tell you about the ""book"" so far -The copMe big stupid screw everything in sight jerk. Me want chick. Get chick. Is weird because want to screw her more than once.The chickHuh? OK.That about sums it up. UGH! BLAH! GAGGING...I have actually read a post about a dude and his blow up doll that was way better than this. Seriously. At least it was funny!I can't believe the books I bought as a gag gift for myself turned out to be not half bad (Jet Mykles), and the ones I picked up based on recommendations and reviews were HORRID. I truly am wishing for both main characters in this piece of crap to be attacked and eaten by zombies. Better yet, someone please send the zombies to the author."
3,Too quick!,Realionship very fast and not really timed well. Some of her books are much better paced.
2,oh no. A weak book.,"I didn't even read it all. I started with enthusiasm, but as I kept reading farther and farther, the book became more and more boring. I had to skip 1/3 of it and go right to the conclusion. Sorry, but I won't buy any of Ms Strong's books."
2,Get what you pay for-- which is not much.,Cheaply made-cheaply sold. 1.The shoe bed is extremely narrow. 2.The thong( the thingy that goes into webbing between the big and next toe) is made out of clear plastic of the same material as a drinking straw and chaffs terribly.Quality zori make the thong of the same velvety material as the straps. Not this product. Avoid.
2,copy of the original,"If you are looking for the original Japanese zori, this product is not for you. This zori is a product from China or Thailand, meaning poor quality, doesn't fit your feet, wears out in a week and risks your injury by slipping out of the widened/stretched out zori.8/17/2012To my great surprise, at least what I see posted, this is a real Japanese zori.My prior comment was based on the Thai slippers I received two years ago.For this kind of zori Five Stars is a mark and usual cost is about $ 40-50."
5,Good set of sandals,I enjoyed wearing these sandals and found them comfortable and plan on using them again and again. Make sure that you check the size so you get a good fit.
3,An interesting collection of 'why's',An interesting collection of 'why's'. The author presents some phenomenom such as why a barmaid can remember all the drink orders of a large table and why moths fly towards a light then suddenly turn away.
1,Defective BGM-E2,"The item pictured is defective and will show a low battery alert when used with a BG-E2N power grip and fresh AA batteries, possibly some earlier grips also.There is a Canon product advisory out on certain power grips but I suspect the problem is the TWO different types of BGM-E2 battery magazines that are being sold. You can't tell until you open the box.The item pictured with silver contacts is the OLD design.The NEW design has gold contacts and is included with the BG-E2N grip.I had a big problem explaining this to Canon service.They finally allowed me a courtesy exchange for the NEW model.The NEW design with gold contacts works perfectly.The OLD design didn't work.Make sure you get the one with gold contacts."
5,A Treat From the Front Cover to the Last Word!!,"I received ""Paris in 3D"" for Christmas and what a wonderful surprise! This book is exciting before you even open the front cover. The front of the book has a beautiful lenticular of the Eiffel Tower. But the wonder does not stop there. Each page reveals beautiful 3-D images which can be viewed with the viewers enclosed in the book. The paper is high quality and the reproductions are gorgeous! As if this weren't enough, the book is engrossing and full of interesting information. I have been interested in 3-D photography for six years. This is the kind of book that I would be comfortable recommending to anyone who loves beautiful, well produced books, regardless of their knowledge or interest in 3-D photography. It is truly a collector's item that the whole family would enjoy viewing."
2,A Definite Step Back,"Maybe I was expecting way too much. I would easily give EOE and NFB 5 stars each. This album is just way too bland. Even the hooks don't get me. Hard to explain - it's just very average, very mundane stuff, certainly not up to the other two albums. I listened to it about five times and probably could not hum one tune if you asked me. Nothing stands out, although the title cut is decent.I hope this was just a minor setback and Pete will come back strong with the next one."
5,not just homocidal aesthetics,"The implications of this book and the works it discusses are grand and engrossing. While most of the work discussed does in one way or another deal with a literal 'crime', this does not limit the arguments developed from associating the 'forensic aesthetic' to our expanded post-modern reality and the way in which signification and meaning do not necessarily correspond neatly, ESPECIALLY when space is involved. The 'investigative' positivism of a passed era is elucidated in light of artworks that even today challenge our comfort with Truth, History, Memory, and Documentation, by pointing out the 'contingent' and shifting role of Evidence."
4,Harold is 'The Man',"Check this book out! You won't regret it. As an experienced 15 year professional I believe this book has you re-exploring the craft of acting. There are two invaluable chapters. The only thing I wish could be explained in more depth is the breathing excercise in Film and Tv chapter. The exercise is described generally, but its mechanics remain a little unclear to me. Maybe I gotta take a workshop with him to learn this interesting technique."
5,If you appreciate congas at all...,...you'll just laugh out loud. Paoli Mejias & Richie Flores are gods of the quinto.
4,Emergency towing,"Looks like it will do the job for emergencies, which is why I bought this one.... for more frequent heavy towing jobs, would suggest a thicker material tow rope."
3,An experiment for the true fan,"A willful experiment, this song cycle often seems neither fish nor fowl -- not ECs best songwriting, none of his pop-song sensibility, nor an inspired piece of classical music. ECs other collaborations with pop greats like Bacharach or McCartney are much better marriages."
5,Delicious!,"This tea is absolutely delicious! It has become my new favorite tea, the flavor is fantastic. Very delicate and mild with a beautiful floral scent perfect paired with honey. I highly recommend this tea! I bought a pack of six and it went fast, everyone in my family loves it!"
5,Best tea ever!,I love black tea. A month or so ago I bought Choice organic black tea to try - I purchased one box at a local natural food store so you can imagine it was pretty pricey. So along my web travels I found it on Amazon for a great price for a pack of 6 boxes. Wonderful news for me as I drink it often. This tea is not like anything else I've ever tried. LOVE IT!!I encourage you to try it!
4,tastes like..,"everyone has their opinions and mine is this tea is tasty. I started as an avid tea drinker a few months ago so I don't know much about what good tea should taste like. all I know is I really like this tea, enough to order six boxes of it. and I would recommend it to anyone, you don't even need to like green tea to be a fan. it tastes like toasted sesame seeds.. or maybe some other kind of toasted seed or nut."
1,English decaf - No flavor,First time I've had such flavorless tea from this brand. Trying to figure out what to do with the rest of it.
1,"Indistinct, stale.","Reading the other reviews, I wonder whether I got a stale box! My tea tasted bland and even dusty. I couldn't taste the slightest bergamot. It was like something you would drink when you're camping in the boonies and it's raining and you have no other way to heat up. Like something out of one of those giant yellow Igloo dispensers you see at tailgate parties on foggy November mornings. I would rather drink hot water. After I tried this, I dumped out my mug and threw the box and its 15 remaining organic tannin packets into the compost! Ashes to ashes."
2,"Not bad, but a little weak for us","My spouse is the one who drinks this most often, as even a decaf Earl Grey affects my sleep. I'm told that this isn't bad, but it's not strong enough. Perhaps it's because it's organic, although I don't know that for sure. Bigelow's is better.Addendum: After a few months of trying four boxes of this tea, we decided its flavor is inferior to Bigelow's Earl Grey Decaf. Not only is it a bit weaker, but too floral, in a perfumy way. We won't be buying it again."
2,Not really earl grey...,"I wouldn't call this a true, delicately subtle floral Earl Grey. The tea, no matter how long or which style it is brewed in, is overly tannic, like a cheap supermarket brand of black tea. It is lovely to smell, disappointing to drink - very little citrus tones (as in, none I could detect) with just the slightest tang of bergamot oil. Extremely disappointing. A good buy if you do not enjoy earl grey but love the smell."
3,Smooth and drinkable but not outstanding,"I am glad it is organic, and it looks as though they have put a lot into making their packaging materials healthy and earth-friendly.The flavor is mild and the amount of caffeine is very low. This is probably because there is very little green tea in this mixture. The flavor mostly comes from the toasted brown rice. This is a nice enough flavor, but it is not really like a more traditional genmaicha which has the flavors of both the toasted rice plus the green tea.I prefer either the Yamamotoyama or the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company versions of genmaicha for commercially available sources. The best tea would come from specialty importers, but that would be quite a bit more expensive."
3,"Not bad, but also not really to my type of taste","I'm looking for organic teas to add to my home tea selection, and I saw this at a local store for a discounted price. I drink my tea hot and without any added sugar or cream. I didn't dislike this tea, but the taste was so non-distinctive that it's not something I'd ever find myself eagerly looking forward to drinking. I probably won't buy it again.This tea is described as a black tea with a ""brisk, bright character that invigorates."" Ingredients: Organic Orange Pekoe Black Tea. (""Orange Pekoe"" is a black tea grade indicating ""a basic, medium-grade black tea consisting of many whole tea leaves of a specific size."" It is not a flavoring.) The directions were ""Boil fresh water, steep tea bag in 8 oz water for 4-5 minutes."" I steeped the tea for 4 minutes.This tea came as 16 individually wrapped tea bags, and the bags are unbleached, natural fiber, and staple-free. The tea is USDA certified organic tea. Fair Trade certified. Non-GMO Project certified."
3,Drinkable but not delicious,"I became a regular green tea drinker during the years I lived in Japan, and although I prefer loose-leaf tea I wanted some tea bags that I could drink at work. Genmai tea is one of my favorites, and I tried this ""Choice Organic Genmai"" thinking it might be an affordable, convenient way to brew up some of that delicious roasted rice flavor.Like many, I found these tea bags to be drinkable but weak. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the loose-leaf tea I buy, but I also wasn't expecting it to be so watery. You can get a decent cup of tea out of it if you make a small cup, but I really wish it was more robust.I will keep drinking my way through the box I bought, but I don't think I will go back for seconds. There are probably better tea bag Genmais out there."
3,A bit woody tasting,"It's not awful but it does not have the smooth green tea taste that untoasted tea has. I love strong teas and often use 2 bags per cup, but this one is too woody tasting for that. I'll drink it but won't buy again. Mixing with cranberry juice helps a lot."
5,Ban-cha Tea....ymmmm,Love this tea. Don't know why it's so difficult to find in the store but thankfully Amazon carries it.
1,not a book but rather a collection of media release reports,"Single stock futures are a very essential addition to the market.they have been put on hold by legistrators. but now they are finnally here in the US market. as an experienced trader and investor I have been awaiting this addition for a while. I read all the reports on the internet and I eagerly baught the first book on this sunject- the one I am reviewing-. I think you will be be tter off reading internet reports and press releases because this is what the author did ...he gathered them then claimed that he wrote a book. for all of you real traders and investors out there ...this is a waste of money..offers tno trafing insights...it seems like a book wriitten by a historian rather than by a proffesional.MHS, Detroit, MI"
4,MEGA TRAY,"I'M A BIG BIG WOMAN OF COURSE WITH SEVERE PROBLEMS, I LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE MEGA TRAY BUT THINK I NEED A THINNER TRAY & MAYBE NOT SO WOODEN. LET ME IN ON SOME MORE TRAYS, PLEASE. THANKS....."
4,A Creepy Character,"Peter Lorre's bald, creepy looks as ""Dr. Gogol"" are memorable in this film. Just look at the cover of this VHS!The story is fairly interesting with a few twists, although a bit far-fetched and a little corny in spots. Then again, it is 70 years old.The black-and-white cinematography is very good in parts. I really liked the closeups on Lorre and the shadows in the hallway. Frances Drake is a pretty woman except for those weird eyebrows, the style of the day, unfortunately.I saw this on a fair-to-poor quality tape. I imagine this looks pretty good on DVD and I'd like to see it again now that it's out on that format."
1,Cheap ... looks used,"Even though item is ""new"" it looks like it has been around a long time. Rough edges and surface of cube has abrasions. Your suppose to turn it on/off by pressing down -- NOT. I have to pick it up and push -- it doesn't sit level on the table. I'd return but not worth the postage."
4,fun!,"I bought this so that my 4 yr old daughter would have something to fidget/play with in bed before falling asleep. She loves it. Doesn't use it every night, but definitely enjoys playing with it. The light is pretty much what I expected, easy to use, and the colors are fun to switch back and forth for a little kid."
1,Just horrible,Don't waste your money on this CD. My mother-in-law bought it for me as a gift on return from honeymooning in Hawaii. I wish I had never opened it so that she could return it. It sounds like something Ross from Friends would invent on his Casio keyboard. I've tried to listen to it three times and have never been able to bear listening to the entire CD. Anyone want to buy it?
2,Hideous,"I have to agree with the other reviewers - this album is an assault to the ears. Please consider something else if you are looking for Hawaiian music. I'd recommend ""Hawaiian Melodies"" by the Voyager Series on Amazon."
2,Music too slow,I didn't care for this CD. The CD says Party music. Yes it Luau music but it just wasn't what I was looking for. It only had the most 2 up-beat temple. The rest was too slow to use for a party.
1,poor quality sofa,"This sofa looked terrific in the photos and it was described as being of top quality leather. When it arrived, the frame was sturdy and well-made, but the leather of the sofa was paper-thin and it didn't smell of leather. I emailed ModernLine Furniture for more information about it and they did reply right away; they said it was premium-grade fine leather and that the back and sides were ""leather-match"", i.e. vinyl. But I can't tell the difference between the ""real' leather and the vinyl. They don't look or smell any different. My cats immediately sank their claws into the leather and ripped it. Because it is paper-thin, there are now holes. I expected tough, resistant leather. This is not. The sofa is not comfortable, but rather hard. This is a very cheap product. It looks good, but it is cheaply made, in China. This is a rip-off, and I would absolutely not recommend this product. I'm afarid you get what you pay for with sofas."
2,very disappointing,"Taking on the general contractor role is a huge task, and there is a lot at stake. I was looking for a realistic guide, but failed to get it from this author. He does not mention any downsides, instead claiming it is easy to do the work without interfering with one's existing job and not even necessary to make more than a couple site visits. This defies common sense and the experience of anyone I have talked to. Look elsewhere for practical advice."
4,Be Your Own House Contractor: Save 25% without Lifting a Hammer by,"Be Your Own House Contractor: Save 25% without Lifting a Hammer. A well written, laid out book about building construction information, where to go what to do and how to help you build your home. Short cuts to learning what you need in planning, paperwork permits and some general engineering information concerning the construction of a house."
5,Great book... arrived quickly,"The cd was broken in the book when I received it. But, when I contacted Amazon, they shipped a new one out right away and I received it the next day! What great service!"
1,No,"Am very disappointed with this kit. I am an experienced do-it-yourself mechanic, having built my first two cars. Have also performed nearly all maintenance on another 12 or so cars - far past 100k miles. Kit was purchased from big-box auto parts store this afternoon. The nebulous instructions were somewhat convoluted; however, was able to deduce the requirements after reading (separate) service manual. The ""quick"" connection fitting was great for blowing refrigerant and oil all over the engine compartment. The gauge and gasket at the refill bottle fitting both failed during initial use. Using this has left me in far worse state. Save yourself the $, effort and frustration - pass this one by."
2,"Worked first time, but hose leaked when reused","This kit worked great the first time, but the reusable hose leaked on each use thereafter. Not a quality kit if you buy it with the intent of being able to reuse the recharge hose."
5,r,product worked great. easy instructions and fast delivery. charged my system in 20 minutes. everything you need to recharge your system in one box. saved close to $150.
4,How High Indeed,These two artists were as good as you get and paved the way for most of todays electronic based music. This album is a perfect tribute to both as it has taken tracks only found on vinyl albums and through some excellent production work has transformed them to the more modern medium of CD. This will give today's generation an opportunity to have a listen to how good these two were even compared with today's artists. It will also help us oldies who now rely on our trusty CD player to revisit another time when things were just a bit different. A very good listen.
4,if you are into early electric guitar,"This is pure Les Paul & Mary Ford.It's old electric guitar and reverb from the '50's.If you are looking for their music, you will enjoy it.If you don't know their work, listen to some sound clips before buying. - Their style is unique, and there is an awful lot of it in this album."
2,Not realistic,"As a licensed and practicing private investigator, I can tell you that this book does not describe the experiences shared by 90% of real life PIs. Much of what is written appears to have been embellished by either the authors or the consultant to be more dramatic and exciting. For example, Mr. Blythe describes how local law enforcement would encourage private citizens with problems to go directly to his home, no matter what time of day or night. Come on! No officer whom I have ever met would do such a thing! Mr. Blythe describes how easily PIs can obtain a full credit report on someone. Very illegal in 99% of the cases!!! This is a great book if you are looking for ideas of how to get your PI in legal hot water. Other than that, check out Greg Fallis' book in this same series for reliable info."
4,"As the title states, this is a valuable guide for writers.","Very few of us get the opportunity to experience the actual day to day environment of the ""cops and robbers'"" world. ""Private Eyes"" does a very good job of showing us what goes on in the everyday life of the private investigator, as well as the police detective. Written jointly by two professors of creative writing and an ex-policeman turned private investigator, this book offers an interesting and helpful insight into the profession of crime investigation. Writers need to be factual in their descriptions. After reading this book I found myself editing some of the relevant data I had erroneously included in my novel. It pays to do good research, and this book worked well for me."
1,Disappointing,"I have to say that I was really disappointed with this book. For the most part, the book is nothing more than stories of the personal experiences of a real PI. While real life stories can certainly help a writer, I would have perferred a little more facts regarding the legal aspects of private investigating and a little more information on private investigating in general instead of just mostly reading about one PI. I came away from this book not knowing much more than before I read it. I really wouldn't recommend buying it. I'd suggest purchasing JUST THE FACTS, MA'AM instead. I found it to be much more informative than this one."
1,NOT HAPPY,"Just not as good in person as the picture..very small, frail looking. already scuffing and it has not even been worn yet"
1,Better records of Paganini out there,I do not want you to waste your money on this CD when there are others like the Perlman or Rabin recordings which are far superior.
5,"Been there, felt that","Who hasn't gotten up feeling grumpy, grumpier, grumpiest?The little girl in The Three Grumpies is having a bad day, followed around from home to school and back by a trio of so-ugly-they're-cute critters. The story is clever and real, and the illustrations are just a hoot, with charming details like the little dog and the frazzled mom."
5,Compelling and Beautiful,"Some years ago, the San Jose Museum of Art (San Jose, California) hosted a showing of Register's work, and this book was featured. How I wish I had bought the book then, as it so accurately captures the very essence of these moving and memorable paintings. Conrad has created his own kind of masterpiece, worth owning because of its authenticity and beauty."
1,not worth the price--nothing that I did'nt know,I wanted to learn more about the technical recruiting field but did not. The only reference to technical was in describing the history of computers and computer responsibilities. Wanted more of an approach or process that I could follow when recruiting however the book is more of a novel versus a learning tool. I have bought other books that are less in price and have received more information.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this directly from VIE and was told it was for all level of recruiters. I explained that I had been a recruiter for 12 years and wasn't sure if I would get anything out of this. I was assured I would. I DIDN'T. For me, it was a waste of money. I would recommend it though for the entry level recruiter or someone who wants to get into the industry."
2,Good Effort...,Solid if unspectacular Uk low-budget action film. My biggest problem with this film was it's lack of scope. For a short film (it's only just 60 mins long) it has a cast of less than 5 or 6 and often looks like it was shot in the film makers bedroom.This isn't to say that it has it's moments. Steve Lawson's fight with Wyndham and Chris Jones is pretty good but the whole thing just feels pretty small.
1,To much money for nothing.,This is just a very short speech and not worth what I had to pay for it. To top it off the speech wasn't very good.
4,McCullough Always Delivers,David McCullough always comes through with a wonderful book about whatever subject he chooses. He brings everything to the reader and allows the reader to participate in The Course of Human Events.
2,"A great speach, but not a book.","I love David McCullough and thought this was a great price on what I thought was a book. I should have read the reviews. It was a great speach, but I wouldn't have bought it at that price if I had known what it was. I will read reviews in the future."
3,Pleasant but read reviews first,"I didn't read the reviews of this product first which was entirely my fault. I thought it was going to be about the making of the Declaration of Independence based on the cover. It is, as mentioned about McCullough's life and career as a historian. Still very interesting, just not what I expected. Still worth having if you are a student of history like me."
5,Captivating. Picturesque. Vibrant.,"To say that David McCullough has a way with words is like describing Mozart as having a way with music. McCullough has an ear for language and the spoken word the same way a wonderful photographer has an eye for a picture- it is just perfect.McCullough gives us a precious gift with THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS as he describes his career and its subjects. He reminds us that we can only live in the present even while we study ""other people's present"". This CD is worth listening to and listening to again as we catch the rythmn of his words and a picture of our nation speeding by into the past."
1,Don't Buy This!,Simon and Schuster is getting a bit greedy here. The McCullough lecture for $8.99? Come on. It is available online for free at the National Endowment for History website. NEH.gov under the Jefferson Lecture. Amazon needs to be more stern with these publishers and stop this kind of thievery.
3,NOT a good idea for custom screen protectors,"I bought these with the impression that I could cut them out and paste them onto my PSP as a screen protector.That didn't work. The glue it uses to stick to the screen creates an annoying effect, and when you take them off they leave a sticky residue that is a pain to get off.I didn't actually try them out for their use as paper laminates, but I imagine that they would work well for that purpose. Just not screen protectors."
1,Not what I expected,"This cd has a lot of good songs on it but BEWARE they are NOT sung by the country artists that made them famous. They just used studio singers. While their voices are nice it's just not the same. The whole reason I bought this was to have Kenny Roger's version of ""Buy Me A Rose"" so I was disappointed. In general it's an okay cd since I do like the songs but it's just not what I expected."
4,Helpful Resource,"This book is very helpful for psychologists, therapists, etc. who are encountering transference/countertransference issues with their clients. The author provides detailed case illustrations with word by word plays of candid countertransference thoughts and fantasies that occur in each session. Following the case examples is a theoretical framework for utilizing countertransference as a therapeutic tool. One piece that this reviewer found scarce in the book was actual statements or interventions utilized in session, as the author focused more on private thoughts not shared with the client. However, the point may have been to think more and say less while working with countertransference."
3,A thoughtful if somewhat long-winded interpretation.,"Barenboim plays the variations thoughtfully and with plenty of ornamentation to satisfy most purists, but his insistence on observing all repeats and his slower-than-usual tempi make this a real time committment for the listener and at times may cause drowsiness. The live Erato recording lets in more coughing and crowd noise than we have come to expect from most of today's live concert recordings. Also the pedal has a distinct squeak, audible through headphones. Despite these drawbacks, this is a good 3rd choice (after Gould 1955 and 1981) for those who like their Goldbergs on piano."
3,LITE Hammer - hope I never have to use it,"I must admit that I was a little disappointed when I received my LITE Hammer. They make it look like it's metal - it's not. The hammer handle is plastic with metal pointed tips and an embedded razor blade for cutting belts. The silver version is painted to look like metal, mine had a pretty nasty paint job. Also, the light is very cheap; it has an inconvenient swinging on/off switch that is small and would, I assume, be hard to use in an emergency situation. One last con, they don't give you anything you can use to mount it to your car - they just give you some dumb suggestions (double-sided tape - like that will hold). All in all, I think the product would perform just fine if required, but this is not a high-quality tool by any means."
4,"It was a fast moving, entertaining story","I enjoyed reading Phyllis Richman's first murder mystery- so much so I hope she continues to write more. Having lived in the Washington area, I have enjoyed her restaurant reviews. I also like cooking. Combine murder mysteries with cooking and I'm hooked. The plot to ""The Butter Did It"" is well constructed and it has plenty of suspects. You learn a lot about the main character, food critic Chas Wheatley. She is not perfect, though. I have a hard time believing she loves to walk in Washington D.C. Traffic, construction and pollution make that difficult. Never mind, it's a good read."
5,There is alot of drooling even if you eat before reading,Death of a great chef. Cause heart attack. But Chas Wheatly feels it is more than that. We get to read about great foods and life of a food critic. Keeps you guessing. Just when you think you might have it a curveball is thrown in. Hard to put down. Love the recipe at the end. Easy for us who are not chefs.
5,This is a book you can't put down!!!,"What a great first novel from Phyllis Richman! It pulled me in on page one and held my attention through the last page, and I honestly hated to see it end. It not only held my interest as a mystery, but was informative into the workings of the restaurant industry. I hope this is just the beginning of a series of ""Chas"" mysteries."
4,Delicious fluff!,"For gastronomic mystery buffs, this is a must read. It's a light confection, but perfectly delicious on a rainy afternoon. Enjoy!"
5,unsettling and incredible,This is serious stuff. Truly incredible accounts and expert analysis/theories attempting to explain them. It's only one of if not the biggest question in life after all isn't it? Life after death? Well watch and be enthralled; unsettled and amazed all in one. Highly recommended.
5,This is wonderful stuff!,"Autumn (no relation to the rock group of today) was an instrumental progressive rock outfit formed in the late seventies by two former members of the Enid (Nick Magnus and Robbie Dobson), one future member of Steve Hackett's band, and a former member of Hawkwind. Suffice it to say that if you like plenty of bombast, complex time signatures, dynamic instrumental passages and the like, this CD would undoubtedly be an invaluable addition to your collection. Having said that, this CD was recorded right before the era when progressive rock when soon become taboo, due to the advent of punk music. Therefore, it did not get the push deserved, and is now out of print. Let's hope that enough people express interest to get it re-released, because it would be a shame if a gem like this sits for another twenty years."
1,Lousy shipping,"The box was left on my back porch in the rain with no bag over it. The entire thing fell apart when I tried to move it. This was after I happened to look out and see it, as no notice was left at the front door alerting me to its presence. There comes a point at which free shipping is not worth it.And, did you know that the plastic they use to individually wrap the rolls isn't waterproof? I DO.I'm cancelling my regular order immediately. What a kick in the teeth."
2,Not as thick or strong as the White version,"I tried both the bleached white and the brown natural versions of these towels and I BY FAR prefer the white; not because of the color, but because you get more for your money.The white towels are not as soft feeling as your grocery store preferred brands. They actually feel rather rough; but they are quite strong and lint free. Both versions are the same size towel, about 1/3rd smaller than your standard papertowel. The brown version feels much thinner and is not nearly as strong. I can't even dry my hands with one towel, they rip to pieces. On both, the perforations are not cut very well and it's nearly impossible to tear off a single sheet, especially the white. I can use the white towel and hang it on my kitchen faucet to dry and use it again; not so with the brown version. The brown towels are in pieces after drying one coffee cup.I wish they would tear off the roll easier but I'd buy the white towel again, but I wouldn't buy the brown natural towel."
4,Good product at a decent price,"These are good paper towels, good absorbency and stand up relatively well when wet."
4,"Good for price, quality and earth","Because I'm a little bonkers, I did the math on a few of the green paper towel options on Amazon and compared them to Costco's Kirkland brand. I went with these because both the quality and price stack up:Price:7th Generation (Natural): .023 per square foot (100% recycled material)Scott Naturals: .025 per square foot (60% recycled)Green Forest: .034 per square foot (100% recycled -- Cost/sq ft is approximate.)Costco/Kirkland: .015 per square foot in the Washington, DC area (Ick. Fluffy and white and sadly killing trees.)Quality:You probably won't want to blow your nose in these, but for regular cleaning they hold up just great and so does your conscience."
1,No Go on These!,"These papers towels are just slightly better than toilet paper in terms of absorbency and disintegration. For years I used to use Target brand paper towels, and comparing to these Target paper towels are superb. I am not even going to bring up Bounty. I just canceled my subscription and would not recommend them to anyone. The only good thing about them that they are made from 100% recycled paper."
2,Not worth it,"These paper towels are comparable to the ones you would find from a dispenser at the movies or other public restrooms. They are not strong, not even close. They are very thin and you would need at least 2 to do the same job as a better paper towel- ie. bounty. And the roll itself is actual smaller than a regular paper towel roll. I got a roll for free and I would personally never waste my money on these paper towels. And this may be a minor gripe, but the actual brown color of the towel is very tacky and cheap-looking. It actually looks as if you took it from a public restroom. Besides it being 'green' I find nothing redeaming about this particular paper towel."
4,Green over style,"Brown paper towels? Of course, non bleached paper is a start in the right direction. Nonchlorine bleached or decolorized paper is just a vanity product. I have some questions though. What about newsprint? US Army medical films used to recommend new newsprint as a sterile drape when conventional materials were not available. Now that the harsh printing inks are gone, how sterile is new newsprint? And, along that regard how can newsprint be treated as to enhance its absorptive capacity?"
4,Decent Paper Towel,"Not the best, but not the worst either. I would put these pretty much in the middle with my experience with paper towel performance variables (absorbency, strength, etc.). There is some room for improvement, but being made 100% from recycled paper, it makes for a good trade-off."
5,I like em',"After reading several reviews about paper towels that used recycled paper, I was hesitant to make the switch from Bounty to a natural brand. I first tried the white Seventh Generation paper towels and was disappointed. The paper seemed to disintegrate when it came into contact with water. I didn't have much hope for the the unbleached version, but was pleasantly surprised to learn that the product is a little stronger. Yes, the paper is rough, but not like the cheap paper towels in restrooms. No, it's not as absorbent as Bounty, but it is more absorbent than generic brands. You may not be able to scrub the counter with these paper towels or suspend items with it, but you will be able to wipe your hands and mouth during meals, or dampen the towels to cover food to be heated in the microwave. You can even clean up light spills and wipe down mirrors. For heavier jobs, use a dish towel and save a tree. It's not always convenient when going green."
2,Not Absorbent Enough,"These paper towels at first sounded like a great idea, but I have found that they are not that absorbent. More paper towels are used for a clean-up job than what would have to be used on a standard Scott's or Bounty towel. When these towels get wet they become very waterlogged and so their capacity to pick up spilled liquids is very limited.I was initially intriqued by the thought of helping to spare the environment by using recycled paper towels, but the benefit is probably eliminated when more of the towels have to be used for the same job. Perhaps if this company made the towels in a higher ply this concern could be addressed."
3,Score it in the middle,"I really wish Seventh Generation Paper Towels were scored down the middle of the 9"" X 11"" sheets like the Brawney ""Pick-a-Size"" towels are. I can see huge benefits to the environment if people could easily pull off just half sheets at a time which is really all we usually need."
2,Not Absorbent,"7th Generation Paper Towels, Natural / B000E44BRUI really wanted to make these work, but my husband has specifically asked me to never buy these towels again. They're just not very absorbent at all. I find that in order to wipe up any spills with them, I have to use several towels - much more than is ""usual"" with other brands (including the 7th Generation towels we had before these!). I don't really know which is ""greener"": getting these towels and using 2 or 3 times as many squares per spill, or getting more absorbent towels and using fewer squares, but I *do* know that we won't be buying this lot any more. I really appreciate all the work 7th Generation is going to to make green products (I love their toilet paper!) but these towels just don't work.~ Ana Mardoll"
2,Eco-friendly but inefficient,"These paper towels are just not very absorbent. I don't mind that they are not white, that they don't have little food related drawings all over them, that they don't tear off in single 1/2 use sized strips or that there are not as many sheets to the roll as some others. What I mind is that, in order to clean up, dry up, whatever, I need to use more than I would if I purchased some that were less Eco-friendly. I'm going to try the white version next and see if they work better."
2,These will rip every time,"Pros:- Fairly cheap.- Environmentally friendlyCons:- Poor quality. I have gone through at least 50 rolls of these things and never once pulled a sheet off the roll without ripping it (unless I hold the perforation with one hand while ripping carefully with the other). These are not strong paper towels at all. For the price, I'm okay with that and will continue to purchase them, but make sure you're aware before ordering."
2,"Good intentionnot economic,needs improvement","Unfortunately,this product does not absorb water or other liquids as good as other brands. I end up using more sheets for a single spot,therefore,I finish a roll much faster than if using other brands (Bownty is my brand of choice). And it doesn''t clean as well either. I welcome and support 7th generation products,but this one needs to improve."
3,less absorbent than regular paper towel,"It is quite less absorbent than regular paper towel. However, ist being environmentally friendly and chemical-free compansates for it. I do my own wipes for my toddler son using paper towel and a recipe for homemade wipes. These are not good for wipes, however, other than that they work ok."
3,Its Green but not so good,"Well the only reason I bought it and will always be buying it again when I see it, is because its a ""Green Product"". If I would compare this to leading brands I would give it a 3 out of 10. But hey, Earth comes first!"
1,WORST paper towels,"I ordered these because I appreciate the idea of using recycled paper, however, these are the absolutely worst paper towels I've ever tried. They are not very absorbent, so you wind up using a lot more than you would with any other brand. And you feel like you are just moving water around. And they are rough.I was trying to be environmentally friendly, but it is not good for the environment that I had to use three to four paper towels in the place of one."
1,answering machine is useless,The answering machine is so muffled that I can't understand the majority of most messages left on the machine. Major disappointment. Battery died pretty quickly on the handset too because I left it on the hook for a month. Careful of that.
4,Another good one from Stark,"Another tough crime caper from Stark/Westlake. Like all the Parker novels this one has a unique approach. The heist really doesn't come off until close to the end, after all the complications (some having nothing to do with the actual crime) have been taken care of. It's fun to see how it will all turn out. And, another interesting character is introduced into Parker's world (Larry Lloyd). I look forward to more and more from Richard Stark. My one question: How old is Parker by now, anyway?"
5,Informative and Easy Read,"Though I believe this was written as a textbook, it has been a great, informative, and easy read on the history of photography. There have been times I have even regretted having to put it down!"
4,Formal gloves,"Perfect for my formal occasion (a new years eve party). These gloves are not for ""high brow"" social occasions, but work well with a formal gown (such as prom, party, etc.); not the opera. The gloves are ""pull-on"" and do not have buttons, but are a great deal for the price."
4,Be aware of size,"Well made steel construction. I use file holders of this type in my office to hold manilla, letter sized files. These file holders get a lot of use, and the plastic ones I have always used break on a regular basis. I thought these metal ones would be perfect, however they were much smaller than I thought they would be from the pictures, and they are not big enough or stable enough to be effective for my use. Would be perfect for home to hold outgoing or incoming mail, or some other use of this type."
2,"A little thick, but worked well enough","I ordered and received the correct version for my non-color 4G ipod. The thickness was a bit more than the original battery, which interfered with the click wheel. I actually had to cut out a portion of the foam to allow for this thickness. After that, it worked fine. Since then (about 6 months), the battery life seems to have degraded somewhat, so I'm shopping for a different replacement."
4,Cheaper by far,"I'm ordering my second replacement battery for my 4G ipod. The first one lasted just over two years before it's battery life fell below three hours. The installation required a bit more force than I thought but I did find their video helpful. All in all, my ipod is fine and this is far cheaper than buying a new one."
2,Cyclin Sara and Sam (Sadness),"We had to jump through hoops to get this item for our year old daughter. The item could not be found in Canada, so we had to have it delivered to NY to a relative who would be visiting Canada for Christmas.We were first disappointed because Sara does not actually sit on the bicycle seat and then slumps down (bum towards bike bars) when the bicycle was moving. Only one day after Christmas, Sara's feet no longer stayed on the peddles. We attempted to adjust the clips on the bike to which her feet attached, but that was only a temporary fix. For the short time Sara's feet remain on the peddles, she no longer peddles!!! Can you believe that? One day after opening the box the dolls whose forte is to peddle her bicycle, no longer peddles. My four year old is truly frustrated dealing with this toy and so are we. We feel cheated."
2,Not what I expected,"Having used the ""You Read to Me, I'll Read to You"" books with early readers, I thought this book also would have sections for the child to read and alternating sections for the adult to read. Descriptions should clearly point out the difference in this book and the ""You Read..."" series. Since this book is definitely not for early readers to read on their own and because my library includes many of the books that are included in this collection of stories, I feel this book will not get much use."
2,Not what I thought it was,"Although as a teacher I appreciate the literature included, I was under the impression (from the title) that this book would have sections for children to read, and complimenting sections for parents to read. I bought it for my young readers, and it is basically a read aloud book."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book to take on vacation for our 3 year old son, hoping that it would eliminated the need to pack 20 or so books. The selections are excellent however the pictures with the stories are small and it seems that many of the pictures have been deleted. And much of the joy of reading these stories comes from looking at the pictures.My recommendation is to print out the table of contents and then go check the individual books out at the library."
3,"Good quality, stable printer, but expensive ink","I also have the E250dn (network attach model) and use it to print about 150 pages per month. I have had only two paper jams in that time (both my fault for not carefully stacking the paper) and they were easy to clear. Print quality is quite good. My chief complaint is that the cartridges are priced sky-high ($100+) and non-Lexmark branded ""compatible"" cartridges may not work due to the electronic chip-matching circuits required in the cartridge. The manufacture has placed this function (which adds cost) to prevent, or inhibit, use of non-Lexmark brand (i.e., expensive) print cartridges. I guess the cost of ink appears to be the only way the printer vendors make any profit."
4,a good soho laser printer,"i bought this to replace a lexmark e232 which quit after two years.. and then i learned that the e232 paper feed roller was substandard. while this printer is fine right now, who knows what will happen in 2 year? i found out later that folks on ebay sell repair kits for these printers.. so no doubt that will be an option two years from now."
5,Works!,"'Nuff said!Here in Texas, getting tomato blooms to turn into tomatoes can be challenging, and this bloom set really helped. Even as daytime temperatures creeped up, this helped me keep probably 25 - 30% more of the blooms intact, and helped me get about a bushel of tomatoes from my 5 plants."
4,Really good product!,"Good product...I have sprayed the blossoms on almost all my veggies and tomatoes with great success.I only gave it four start due to the fact that a lot of my blossoms are shriveling up and dying this year.I realize that I have had the same bottle for two years and I am not sure if it looses its potency over time.I was very pleased the first year as the year before I didn't use it and I got a very small crop.Last year was better then the year before but this year is not starting off so well.I've had a ton of blossoms but very little fruit to show for it..Haha.Over all I am pleased and am going to get another bottle for this year to see if it does indeed help to buy a new bottle every year.I am not sure if it is helping my butternuts or my eggplant though,as we have had 103 temps and I suspect that the heat has had something to do with my fruit not setting....but I am keeping my fingers crossed!"
1,Blossom set spray,"I was getting no tomatoesbut after spraying with this product, my plant isloaded with tomatoes. Great product!!"
4,Interesting stuff,"Finding Carissimi is never easy at a music store. However, I tried this particular CD right before a classical store went out of business. Interesting music from a period that is often ignored, music of the mid to late 1600's.Carissimi had his sphere of influence, most notably with Marc Antoine Charpentier who would produce many of the most profound works from the French Baroque. Carissimi's works are fresh and interesting, most effective when at their most serene.The last chorus of the Jepthe really made this album for me. One of the most relaxing and serene pieces of music I have ever listened to. I recommend this album if you can find it."
5,Perfect fit,This is a well made simple to install cargo liner. It took me all of ten minutes to install it and much of that was used in cleaning out the cargo space. It is a shade stiff when cold (20s-low 30s) but is still easily lifted should one need to get into the storage area.
5,"Great liner, fits perfect.","I had a set of WeatherTechs floor liners in my Tacoma and figured they would work great in a Rav4, so I ordered some of these. They arrived very quickly and were easy to put in. They are rolled up in a box for shipping, but laid out flat in just a little while with the car heater on. If you ever actually use your SUV to haul something messy, you should be very happy with these."
4,narrow mindedness is a crime,"It is fine to say that witchcraft is not geared towards money... indeed it is not... what it IS geared towards however is the betterment of your life and the lives of those around you. If that means monetary wealth, happiness, and the various other things countless wiccan writers have listed as spell genres, than blessed be. THe only real crime is that of close mindedness. It is unfair to give the book a bad review simply for it's spell genres and it is unfair to say that anyone who uses these spells is abusing the powers of wicca. There are altruistic ways to use money spells!!!"
2,The thought.,I think it's like all the other books on spelz. I give it a two because it's the thought that counts isn't it? Spelz come from each individual. Even though I will keep it in my collection of spelz books I wouldn't recomemd it as anything real or anything. Just an okay book for people who collect these kinds of books.
1,Deleted Reviews?,Hmmmm Most interesting! Wonder who is deleting some of the reviews. Myself and others keep up with these kinds of books and have been reading Amazon reviews. Looks like someone is not happy with what some of the reviewers have been saying. Isn't that the point of having this review site in here???
2,Save your pennies,"OK, if you're really in a pinch and need money, I suggest you save the 6 or whatever dollars they will charge you for this book and invest them in something more useful. Otherwise it's a spellbook for prosperity, just as the title says. I personally think it's more of a Debtor's Anonymous clear-up-yer-debt handbook than anything witchy. But OK, if you feel you can't make up your own money spells, it's wonderful..."
1,Lighten UP,"Hey Ms. For the Record. Why so hostile? There's only 4 reviews in here that I can see and you are the forth one posted under ""FOR THE RECORD"" talking about everyone being ""OUT OF THE LOOP"" . What's up with all this? I can't see anyone saying anything bad about your so called ""MOST SOUGHT AFTER"" writer. So here's one star for a book that is'nt anything special in my view. Is that all right with you? Lighten UP!"
3,Greed takes a left turn!,"As anyone will know, I am and have never been, a fan of Silver Ravenwolf. Call me old fashioned, but I come from a different age of witches, an age that reveres the Old Ways. This new mish-mosh of garbage is so misleading. While witchcraft is our birthright, using the power greedily for one's own prosperity is very selfish indeed.Please, if you are new to wicca, witchcraft, or paganism, stay away from every book Ravenwolf has written. Better yet, look into the books by Raymond Buckland, Scott Conningham, and Amber K."
4,Wonderful!,"This book is very helpful. I got this book for my birthday and I plan to do many of the things in it. From simple chants to spells, this book is very good for the person who wants to bring a little wealth into their life. Blessed Be!"
1,Waste of Time,I feel that this writer wastes their time in these types of writings. First I think it would be better to know about what you are writing. Secondly this book is just a lot of waste filling pages that could be better filled with real knowledge of the Craft. Of course for the novice or the uneducated I suppose it would be interesting or entertaining. It seems to be a lot of words that could be made up by anyone. I think it's a waste of the writer's time and any reader who is looking for realistic information about the Pagan beliefs and rituals.
5,more than just spell,I think that this books afirmation value alone is good enough to lable it as more than just a book of spellsto be it you must believe itthe positive afirmations of performing these spells puts you into the mindset for success and opens you up to self improvementIt gets you actively involved in bettering your life and not stressing out over every little dollar that goes out the door
4,i don't care what other people say i think she is a great,"this book was great, and it made since to all of you that it did not make sense, where are your brain cells, she is a great author, and so what if she does things differently, you guys are not perfect either, god and goddess aren't gonna strike her down with lightening because she doesn't do things to your standards"
5,Described well & on time,"The book was described as slightly used, but still in very good condition. The book did look almost brand new. I may not have noticed some of the wear, if it had not been disclosed that it was not new. But I am glad it was, so I could make an educated decision regarding this purchase.The packaging kept the book very well protected. I paid the extra fee to have it delivered sooner, and it arrived within that quicker timeframe, as expected.This was a very good experience, and increase my confidence that this seller describes items accurately, and delivery occurs within the timeframe promised."
1,"If you're out of the LOOP, stay out.","another disappointment in someone who had a lot of potential. I don't know if it's pressure to turn out more books, or what.. . but this just doesn't hit the mark."
1,Not reversible and not lee.,"Ordered this. Received and product has no ""Lee"" lable on it anywhere. I was going to give this as gift. But I can't because the product is a ""no brand"" belt.And it is totally not ""reversible"". The cotton side is wasted because the belt is NOT designed for you to be able to wear both sides. And such makes me believe more it is not ""Lee"" because obviously a good brand product would not make such mistake."
3,"A ""B"" Movie At Best","I bought this VHS after reading some of the customer reviews on Amazon and I will have to be more discerning in the future. Some of the reviews that were 5 stars raved about the production and the performances and I gotta wonder what they were watching or if they were sober during their movie experience. This was a ""B"" movie at best and even for the early 1930's this was a poor effort. I have always been a fan of Boris Karloff, Myrna Loy and even Lewis Stone, but I'm afraid they were wasted in this effort. Even comparing it with Bela Lugosi's Dracula from the early 1930's and Frankenstein of the same time period, it can't hold a candle. Lousy script, poorly staged and everything that went with that type of production. Too bad."
4,A CORNUCOPIA OF DELIGHTS,"The kind of movie they, alas, don't make anymore -- a stylish adventure with exotic settings, a glamorous cast, zesty direction, and a lacing of humor.The video I bought has trimmed some of the ""yellow peril"" dialog which now seems blatantly racist, but it also edited down the famous scene in which handsome-and-hunky Charles Starrett is flogged by Myrna Loy's slaves. (Myrna appears to get really excited while watching Charlie writhe.) Considering all the head-exploding violence going on in movies today, it's bewildering to find that someone took the time and trouble to edit out the simple lashing of a whip."
5,Karloff amazes,"If you are a Karloff fan, you must see this movie. What a role - a rich Asian sadist! Myrna Loy is also quite impressive. I think the best part of this movie (other than Karloff's acting, and his make-up job - wow!) are the sets. There are different torture rooms for different characters. I've never read any of the Fu Manchu books, so I can't comment about that. But Karloff's portrayal is pure evil and pure genius!"
4,"Sounds Corny, But Is Very Effective","This was a bit different with Boris Karloff playing an Asian ""bad guy."" He plays ""Fu Manchu,"" and man who sets out to get Genghis Khan's mask and sword which supposedly will give him the power to rule over millions of people.Despite the classic film casting of white people to play Asians, I found Karloff to be ""cool"" looking as was his evil daughter, a young Myrna Loy. I like Karen Morely, usually, but not in here where she plays an almost-hysterical daughter of one of the good guys.""Fu Manchu"" shows some of his unique methods of torture, nothing graphic, thankfully - not like today's blood and guts.Some of this is amateurishly-done but overall it still a legitimate amount of real horror and terror and the cast certainly is entertaining. (""Andy Hardy"" star Lewis Stone also is in here along with Jean Hersholt and Charles Starret.)Summary: a decent and almost-mystical adventure story that doesn't overstay its welcome, either, at a tidy 68 minutes. Pretty good stuff."
1,Can't hang properly,I was very disappointed that the holes in the handles don't line up so that when the cups are nested one can not hang the group from a single hook. Bad design. I would not buy these again.
2,LOOK good,"These measuring cups LOOK great. They LOOK just like ones I got at Williams-Sonoma years ago for more than twice the price. But that is where the similarity ends. Save up for the good ones. These are quite flimsy - when packing brown sugar into one of the cups, the handle bent way down - I bent it back up, but every time I try to put anything into it with any pressure, they bend again. I'm strong, but not THAT strong."
5,"better measurements, better recipes","I had a few sets of plastics cups before, but were frustrated with how the markings were coming off, and also wasn't confident that the measurements were accurate. I read reviews of this set, and am very happy with the purchase. They're far superior to the plastic, and already my recipes have started coming out better with more accurate measurements. Can't speak to longevity (re handles) as they're a recent purchase, but doing well so far."
5,simple basic design,"nests perfectly. comfortable to use, easy to clean and store. difficult to find. i wanted a second set for a vacation house."
2,Handles fall off.,"These are quite lovely, no nonsense steel measuring cups. Until the handles inevitably fall off. I had dreams of having a friend weld or braze the handles back on but I lost them before I could get them to him."
2,handle broke off,"I like these cups; however, the handle of the 1/4 cup measuring cup broke off with just normal use. I can't seem to find AMCO's website to maybe get the matter resolved. I'd get something else that has the handles attached more securely."
3,Handle broke off,"Bought on the advice of Cook's Illustrated after reading about accurate measuring. Nice flat brushed stainless look, but the handles are a bit flat and sharp on the edges so they bite into your fingers with scooping - I prefer a rounded edge handle for this reason. And my 1/2 cup handle broke off about 6 months after purchase. Disappointed, won't buy again."
1,Zero Stars,I don't know what America's Test Kitchen was thinking when they recommended this set of measuring cups. I can only imagine what utter crap the others must have been compared to this set.Cheaply made and poor workmanship on attaching the handles. The handle on one of the cups was so thin that even the slightest pressure will bend it. The others seem to be ok.Can't recommend this product.
1,Not Good,The handle on one of these measuring cups fell off with less than a month's use. Very disappointing. with this purchase I was attempting to replace the measuring cups I had whose handles fell off! Stay away from these.
1,Handle on one cup broken in shipment,"I was disappointed to find the handle broken off one of the measuring cups when I opened the package. It appeared to be a defective product and not a shipping problem as the cups were well packaged. Two dot-sized spots were visible on the cup and on the handle where it was originally attached, but the dots were so tiny that I couldn't determine whether they were suppose to be welds, or if they were glued. These cups would be an excellent product if the method for attaching the handles was improved."
5,Still great after all these years,"We received these measuring cups for a wedding gift in 1993. I use them everyday, and they've behaved like champs. Sometimes the handle bends a little if I apply too much pressure scooping something (usually brown sugar), but they straighten easily. They're great!"
3,Great bad with 1 big disadvantage,"I love the design of this bag. It has plenty of room inside for your larger items. I have 4 in diapers (triplets plus 1) and had plenty of room in this bag! And the outside pockets keep smaller stuff in easy reach. I like the material that it is washable, though I do wish it was a darker color. But I do NOT like the Velcro closure, which is why this bag is going back. I put a majority of the stuff I carry on a daily basis in the bag, closed it and put in on my bag and the velcro opened as I was putting it on. It does have a pull tie also but I still don't like the velcro top opening. I just wish it had some clips or a snap to keep the top closed. I guess I will keep looking for the perfect bag."
4,Love this bag!,From the moment I seen this bag I knew I had to have it. It looks like a stylish accessory plus the benfits of a diaper bag.The only thing it's missing is a changing pad. It may look a little big for some but I say if u are a busy person and like to travel this bag can hold it all. I can not wait to get this bag home and use it.
2,Decent contents but in need of quality editing,"I used this book for my recent healthcare communications class. While the information contained within the book was quite informative, the text itself was not well written. There were large numbers of run-on sentences and I even spotted the word 'reckon' within the text. The word 'reckon' should never be included in formal writing. In fact, the only appropriate place for the word 'reckon' is as a quote, either in fictional dialogue or as a quote of a real person. The poor writing forces the reader to glean the information from the text, hampering the ability of the reader to gain much from reading it. I hope the publisher and/or authors deal with this in future editions. It could be a great textbook once these issues are addressed."
2,Not enough respect for readers,"Book is mostly about respect, but it looks that the authors need to develop a new aspect of self-respect: to say the same they wanted to in fewer words, probably 1/20 from the written amount. The book is very hard to read, it seems to be a poor translation from another language. Sometimes in the end of long sentence you see that they already have forgotten what was in the beginning. Nevertheless, when you finally dig out a thought from the pile of word litter, it might be an interesting one."
5,SUPER SERIES! THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THEM!,"I purchased two of these videos a few years ago. Pastor Schwarz (a.k.a. ""Mr. Whistle"") relates to children briefly and clearly about the message of God by applying stories of the Bible to today's life. ""Skits"" from the Bible are performed in the Holy Land, where parts of videos were filmed. I once heard Pastor Schwarz speak at a conference and his message was just as captivating for adults! He is a WONDERFUL teacher! I highly recommend these videos to parents or teachers of young children. They are short and easy for children to understand. My children love to watch them over and over again!"
3,"Good for details and coloring, but not drawing...","This book is full of color pictures of uniforms (maid, restuarant, cat costume, female business dresses, and some ""sexy"" costumes.The book shows the uniforms in simulated 3d both on a sample character and clothes only (no sample character in them). It will help you get a feel for the coloring and the details, but it doesn't have any steps for drawing the uniforms pretty much all you see is the final step. So if you want to see finished drawings of a good cross section of female uniforms and some costumes, then this is the book you want."
1,Fanny at Chez Panisse,It has more story than recipes. The recipes I didn't find very useful with children.
4,Read this early on the weekend so you can cook later!!,"Alice writes in the voice of her daughter about her daughter's favorite recipes and adventures at the restaurant. Wonderful reading and DELICIOUS recipes. At first looks a little like a children's book, but great for adults!"
5,Charming book,The recipients of this gift were very happy with it--and wanted to know where they could buy copies to give. I particularly enjoyed reading the introduction with it's details of life in northern California. Well-made book--quality paper and binding.
1,Both cats refuse to ingest it,"I tried the full 1/4 tsp dose mixed into the cats' favorite wet food. They wouldn't go near it. Then I halved the dosage for kitties (works out to 1/8th teaspoon) mixed into an entire can (5.5oz) of wet food that my kitties adore. They won't go near it.I tried it on their dry food. They won't go near it.The only way I can get it into them is to mix it with water and force feed it via pet syringe. I don't know about yours, but my cats don't like this at all. They will hide from anyone who comes near in fear that they'll get picked up and dosed. So, you trade good urine pH for your cat's trust."
4,NERF BARS,"These sport tubes aren't exactly what I thought they are, but have worked out very nicely and look great. They were very easy to install, with the exception of missing two of the specalized nuts that anchor these bars to the frame."
3,Re-Publish Alert!,"This book was previously published as ""Heart's Folly"", in 1988. It IS dated - I throughly agree with the review by Kathleen, above. The heroine is irritating, and way too self-sacrificial. Feather has written much better books, since."
2,Disappointing...,"The research that must have gone into this book was tremendous, and for that, Ms Feather should be commended. From the blurb, the story had a lot of potential, but for me, it didn't live up to it. I got tired of Polly always backing down when she and Nicholas disagreed. The emotional connection between the two just didn't come across as convincing for me, and I don't feel like I got to know them very well to be able to empathize with them. I got to page 270, but I've had enough."
2,UGH,"The book started off as a very interesting book, it ended as an almost terrible book. The only reason this book did not receive a one star is that the love that these two felt for one another definately took precedent over everything else in their lives. The plot was well written and the book originally showed promise, however some of the actions that some of the characters took in the course of the book were incredibly displeasing. (I wont spoil) But I also wouldnt recommend. If you are wanting a sappy love story that is alls well this is probably not the best choice. However if you like a little bit of intrigue and a whole lot of dissapointment this might be the one for you."
2,Not Impressed,"I've been reading historical romances for awhile now but I just recently started reading books by Jane Feather. This is the 2nd one I've read and I had a very hard time finishing it. The reason I had such a hard time was because of Polly, the main female character. I couldn't stand how stupid she was...yes she was only 17 yrs old but c'mon...it was just too much. I'm going to continue reading Feather's books but I'm hoping the other books are much better..if anyone has any good books by this author please let me know so I can begin again with a good one by Feather..."
1,Was hoping for better,"I have been reading historical romance novels for about 20 years (I started early). This has got to be one of the most boring one that I have read. I could barely finish reading it, but I just kept hoping that it would either get better or just plain end. Polly was childish and whiny and Nick didn't have a backbone. (...)I am hoping that the next Jane Feather novel is better than this one. What happened to good romance novels, it seems that they are more about being political correct than probable."
1,A massive disappointment,"The hook to read this was so intriguing - but after that, the book was a massive disappointment and shows the 1980s type of story. Hero was too modern and didn't fit his time period - like wanting a woman with a career. That didn't happen in the 17th century! Everything is building up to the Polly and Buckingham story - and we get cheated out of that. Don't bother with this read, folks. Some stories are best left in the past."
5,Out-of-Print----BUT NOT FOR LONG,"As the author of this book, you may want to ignore my rating! I am really writing to simply note that the book will be reprinted late in 2001 or early in 2002 by The Johns Hopkins University Press. I have written a new introduction for the JHUP edition to bring the book up-to-date on all the latest about Heaviside."
4,My kid love it,I need to buy this book because my kid accidentally spilled water on library book and we need to replace the library book. Anyways he loves this book.
1,WARNING: This is NOT the complete version of the game,"This boxed retail version is -- by design -- missing characters, gameplay, and features which are only available when the game and expansion are purchased directly from the developer, Sandlot Games. No where on this page or on the box is it mentioned that you will only receive a reduced version of these games if purchased here.Well, now you know. Caveat emptor."
1,no product,I would love to review the product. The product has still not arrive and its been 5 weeks going on 6 weeks since the initial order. They state it would arrive by July 27 and it is now August 6th. I have filed a complaint but that won't be reviewed until sometime in August late. SO this is the product review.
5,HP AC Adapater,"Received it quickly, works fine. Found missing one within an hour of its receipt. Ain't that the way it goes?"
5,Perfect Mom Day gift,"The earings were exactly as described and were delivered on time. My wife could not have been more pleased with the gift, nor could I with the perfect service received; it was exemplary."
1,very large,"I had expected these to be small stud earrings. They are about 1/2 inch in size and cover almost my entire earlobe. My teenagers told me they look like ""old lady"" earrings."
3,Be warned,"I bought this item hoping that the disc for ""Picture Perfect,"" one of my favorite romantic comedies, had been updated, but it hasn't. Be warned that it is widescreen, but NOT enhanced for 16 by 9 TVs, so it is a small image with bars on the sides. The other two films ARE enhanced for 16 by 9. I wish this information had been in the product description."
5,Jennifer Aniston Collection,While Jennifer Aniston has starred in better films these three are worth watching. Recommend them at a reasonable price. Three for less than the price of one is very good.
1,"JA ""Collection""","Surprized that this product is called a ""Collection"", when there are only three of Jennifer's earliest movies included. What about: ""Office Space"", ""Derailed"", ""The Break Up"", ""The Good Girl"", ""Along Came Polly"", ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Rumor Has It"", ""Friends With Money"", ""Management"", ""Marley & Me"", and of course, ""Leprauchan"".Weren't any of these worthy to be considered for the collection?? Apparently not."
2,Not 100%,"Product received was as pictured & described; however, I received a reel with damaged hose and a rough guide roller. May be going back?"
1,this is not what it appears to be,my son had his ds for 5 months. the battery went bad. I found this and ordered it. It did not fit a ds in any way. This product should be removed from this site. My son was very upset. We ended up buying a new ds and hope this one lasts longer. Stay away from this.
5,A masterclass from the Master.,"I love Joe pass. Everyone loves Joe Pass. If you are a fan you will adore this DVD. He is so humble and ironic at the same time, and he gives tons of information here. I think this DVD is much better than his Blue Side of Jazz (maybe but that time he was already ill). I learned a lot from this one and I think all musc lovers (not necessary jazz) should have this."
5,Joe is the greatest,"I first rented this from NetFlix. Joe takes you through the I-vi-ii-V progression. I think this DVD is good for an intermediate guitarist. The DVD has some bonus features which is nice. There is a chord section, where you can see tabs of all the chords Joe plays on the DVD. There is a slo-motion section where you can see how he fingers the chords (I didn't find this very helpful). But what's really neat about this lesson is that one of the greatest guitarists of all time shares some of his methods - how he looks at the chords, his philosophy of how to play, etc. Extremely valuable is his perception of chord sounds. Did you know he thinks of an Am as being the same as a C chord? That blew me away and opened up a lot of possibilities."
4,Not that funny,There was only 1 story that actually got me to chuckle. The rest just didn't strike my funny bone but they were interesting to read about. If you like reading travel adventures...this is a good book to pick up. Funny women....not even close.
3,Some amusing anecdotes,"Some of the stories in this collection are pretty amusing, especially the ones that stick to brevity to relay their humor. Some, however, drag on a little, and a few could have benefited from some revising. And some just made me downright uncomfortable - especially the little story about the woman who gets a giant cockroach stuck in her ear (I guess it's a testament to good writing that it made me skeevy for a few days, thinking about a bug scrabbling away in there!).All told, though, I enjoyed the book as a little piece of enjoyable quick-reading and would probably pick up another book in the series."
4,A Laugh a Minute!,"I love humorous personal essays, and I love travel misadventure sagas. Put them together, and you have the recipe for a hilarious book. Beginning with the title and on through each of the couple of dozen essays, humor and hijinks abound! Read about shopping for undies from the street vendors in India, or getting attacked by a brain-sucking beetle via the ear canal... you'll groan, grab your stomach, and laugh, laugh, laugh. I can't wait to read the other collections by this editor. Fabulous!"
2,eeehhh.,Don't bother. This is just some mostly dull travel stories. The title would lead you to believe that these are all humerous but some just seem to fill space. An okay plane read or leave it in the bathroom instead of old magazines. Better yet buy a Bill Bryson travel book. Now those made me laugh out loud.
4,A great read!,"I hold great respect for ladies that travel, especially the ones who travel to Third World countries. The toilets of developing countries are well...less than ideal. It is a lot easier to laugh at having roach in your ear in Moorea, a day after it happens, what a way to spend a honeymoon! How about a trip to the Great Wall of China with a two mile hike to the gondola ride, only to find out you will have to slide down a mountain to the parking lot, as the cable just broke. This book is loaded with tales of similar travel misfortunes, the joy of travel and the agony of travel from around the worldIt is the mis-adventures of travel that bring upon the best stories, be they hurricanes or diarrhea. So have a seat in the comfort of your living room and share these hilarious tales of travel fortune and misfortune, the best part is you don't even need to take along your Imodium."
1,Another undergarment disaster,Surely there were more suitable submissions to Travelers' Tales than these. It was my fault for purchasing this book. I got confused and thought it might be funny. But shame on me twice bc I also bought the 'sand in my bra' mess as well. Please hire new writers and an editor who knows how to edit. Keep the cover photographer.
4,"Battery works great, installation tool marginal","Battery works perfectly once installed. Very difficult to use the included plastic tools to pry open the ipod, I ended up using a very fine bladed serrated knife instead. The plastic tool also will have the tips deform as you continue to try to get them to work. Excellent product, would be much better if they had a metal installation tool."
1,less than 1 star,"if i could rate this -0, i would. i have had oodles of sugar free products and have never had anything that was as bad as these little chunks of wax. I threw the entire bag (minus the 2 pieces i tried to 'like') in the garbage. My dog wouldn't even eat it and she eats anything! If you truly like chewing on wax, then by all means, buy this product. If you're looking for something that is sweetened and had a cherry flavor, stay away from this crap!"
1,horrible sugar free candy,"this cherry sf candy has no flavor at all. It is a total waste calories. It isn't chewy, it falls apart when you chew it."
4,A Good Read to Come From the 80's,"Growing up in the 80's, there were few children's books which made an impact. Most books I read were literary classics or had last been printed in the late 1970's. This was one of the few I read that actually had been originally published in the 1980's. Looking at the cover of the book, I really thought this had been an awful suggestion made by my High School teacher to reccommend me. Yet, I should have known I would have liked it, since his past suggestions had always been well recieved by me. It indeed was a swift and speedy read and it had a good point throughout. I would reccommend this to fellow students (preferably 9th & 10th graders) as a well deserving book to read."
5,"Heavy, but worth it's weight in gold.","National Geographic puts out a quality product. In this age of online-tech, which seems so fleeting, this atlas of the world is solid. I like printed reference materials. This is the ultimate in printed reference for a world atlas. World borders will ultimately change, but for the next decade, I would highly recommend this atlas. It is hardcover and the paper is of the best quality, so it's heavy to hold, but lay it down and explore the world. There is much info to learn. If you just want a map, or you want to learn more about a region, how can you go wrong."
5,Great looking mats!!,"Mats fit nice in my Dakota pickup. Fast shipping from this seller. Very happy, perfect transaction."
1,Preferably zero stars...,"To add to the other review, from another person mulitply diagnosed (now up to Autism, Elective Mutism with Austistic Features (High-Functioning Autism didn't exist when I was a child), Asperger's and Nonverbal Learning Disorder.Hugging is, and was, more than punitive to me when I was a child, and even now, as an adult, can be painful.Physically painful. Skin-on-skin touch, with humans or any other creature, literally feels like it is scalding if I haven't braced myself in advance. (Mind you, I've found ways to cope with it as an adult, since I have the misfortune to not be an asexual type.)For a moment, imagine pouring boiling water over your autistic child. This is precisely what your ""affection"" might feel like to that child. For goodness' sake, if a child is rejecting touch, s/he may have a good reason! And enforcing your hugging is only going to make the child start to avoid you."
5,Oil Rubbed Bronze Double Robe Hook,"Love the look of this product. Also, terrific service and fast shipping by Everything Doors from whom I purchased the product!!"
4,Awesome!,"This headgear is really cool. there are straps on top to make it tighter, looser, and u can adjust the height. the only downside is how teh chin bar ( the bottom part) fits. the chin bar sticks out of your chin. there is really no way to make the chin part fit better but everything is pretty nice. it has excellent padding. the inside material feels like a suede/ nubuck. it gives decent visilibty and it deffinetly takes the sting out of the punch. it is pretty well made overall. only 4 stars because of the odd fitting chin bar."
5,head gear,"I am happy with htis head gear. I have not used many times but the times I have used it has worked great for me. It gives you good protection and is very comfortable,"
2,Kinda Misleading.,"What the picture shows, and what I got from Fogdog are two different things. The pictures show the old style, black and white 1910 logo. What I got (in a battered box) was the new style MMA.You can buy it here, and get free shipping:Everlast Everlast MMA Full Coverage HeadgearIf you want the MMA headgear, then Hey! You got it. But I wanted the old logo to match my gloves."
2,"Cute look, cheap material, broken zipper",These shoes look very very cute and stylish online but are not made well. The material was a cheap faux suede and the zipper was broken on my pair. I returned them!
2,"This isn't for dual. 2nd peg stands like 30 degree tilted, not adjustable.","The price is still great for one instrument, so I decided to keep, however, this ended up I needed to buy another stand for a 2nd instrument.The 2nd peg isn't straight against the floor, so the instrument stands pointing out to the way, which isn't good at all (looks ugly, too), as people who are coming close may hit the reed. Oh boy!, this isn't a good stand."
5,Awesome Product!,"I have this set up in the band room where I teach and I must say that I absolutely love it! I have no complaints! It does what it is supposed to do! The only thing that would make me love it even more is if it had a beg on the other leg so that I can have my Alto Sax, Flute, and Clarinet all on one stand."
5,awesome saxophone/clarinet stand,"works perfectly with my tenor sax and clarinet. the clarinet peg is positioned so that both can be stored on the stand if necessary. only a few minutes of assembly required, no tools needed. however, you have to move the bottom foamed-covered piece up and down by unscrewing it and putting it in a different slot when switching from alto to tenor sax (so it doesn't scratch). otherwise it's very portable and easy to use."
1,not good for my oboe or tenor sax,"well i bought this for the price and it held my alto and flute, but after a few days, the screw to secure the sax stand wouldn't work, so now it swings around everywhere, and im scared for it. i kept it, but i am about to buy a new one because: i switched to tenor sax and oboe, and the flute peg does stand out a few degrees, so i freak out about my oboe reed. also THE SAXOPHONE STAND'S BELL SUPPORT IS TOO SMALL AND IT WON'T FIT MY TENOR'S BELL ON IT!"
4,Useful for driving between cities,"We used this map while driving around Crete and mainland Greece for 2 weeks. It's probably about as good as you can get for Greece where nearly all the roads between cities do not have names or numbers (besides the handful of national roads) and most of the exits do not have a number or street/highway name - just the name of 1 or 2 cities that you can drive to from that exit. It has a nice table with reasonably accurate driving times and distances between cities. It would have been nice if it included some detailed maps of the major cities on the back. It is sometimes difficult driving from the highway down to the old part of town since most guide books only shows the streets for the old/historic part of town. If you are driving in western Crete, I would suggest picking up the more detailed free map you can get at the Chania airport to supplement this one."
2,cherylscience,The other stack- n- whacks were nicer squares with more material that showed more of the cut material. There is too much empty space on these quilts.
5,Loads of good stuff,"This stuff is good, too good unless you have a lot of dogs and need to bath them a lot. We still have tons of it after 6 months, we only need to use 2 tablespoons for our 7 pounder. Even so it's still a great deal. It works really well. For us a smaller bottle would be nice so we don't have to store the jug."
3,This book has its plus points,"If you want to know the history of Turner, it is a great book. If you want high quality photos, great book. If you want inspiration, you might be impressed or not. Turner has his own style and you get to see many variations of the same theme, which often are minor differences from one photo to the next. I like the book, just not on the top of my list"
5,Absolutely Love,I bought this print and purchased my own frame. It is absolutely one of my favorite things in my home.
5,A Water Music for the ages,"Among all the recordings of Handel's Water Music I own, this is for me the most uplifting. Yes, it is on modern instruments. Yes, it was recorded in 1962, but if you can get hold of this on CD you'll find the sound as wonderful or better then any modern recording. August Wenzinger and his orchestra seem to me to have the measure of Handel's music completely. Tempos are just right and you can almost feel the fun these people are having with it. One of my most treasured discs."
3,"Good music, bad sound/video","Title says it all...Pros:* Fantastic selection of Liszt's works* Top-notch performanceCons:* Sound quality is poor, and has a sight hiss you can here all throughout* The video looks like it came from a 1986 camcorder--significantly below par even for 1986Watching it on a home theater is painful, and such a shame because they're wonderful performances."
1,Sound AWFUL- video AWFUL,"Because I love Earl Wild's playing of Liszt and because of the rave reviews, I bought this DVD. The sound is worse than the old 78's from my childhood and our home movies were better. I don't understand where these marvelous reviews came from, they must have been about different concerts than the ones on my DVD. I will continue to enjoy Mr. Wild's playing on CDs and I don't recommend anyone waste their money on these DVDs."
2,Why pay?,"The book took some work, it is well written and illustrated and mostly accurate from what I can see of the local state parks mentioned. All that said, I did not get any information from it that I could not get from free publication from the State Parks themselves. If you intend to visit a number of Oregon State Parks at a time then this may be a good one stop publication that has a little back round information such as "" one of the few State Parks not to have a sign at the entrance"" (Bolen Island, actually it does)but all the pertinent information you need is available from Oregon State Parks for free."
4,Till rocks.,"I don't know for sure that this is the same CSO/Barenboim recording I just heard on the radio, but I think it must be. If so, this is a rocking Till! I make no comment on Heldenleben since I haven't heard it, but on Till the orchestra sounds balanced, precise, in time, and in tune. The brass is not overbearing but is sufficiently ballsy with a good sound when required. The soloists are fine and the tempos are right on.I don't think I've heard a better Till."
5,In the great tradition of American poetry,"I heard about this collection of poems from a colleague. He told me that Michael Sowder is one of the finest new poets to come out of the American romantic tradition. To be honest, I've read very little poetry of late that has moved me, so I was thirsty for something to catch my attention. I purchased ""The Empty Boat"" and begin reading...and reading. For the first time since I was a teenager, I have found a poet that speaks to that longing for simplicity, adventure and purity which saturate our adolesence but mysteriously dry up as we age and wear in our shoes. Sowder teaches us once again how to see the world through an innocent eye. He leads us, guides us. Indeed, he is a sort of Counselor directing us ever onward, ever forward. Bravo to Michael Sowder, the ""Counselor""."
4,It's Deadpool and Cable,Art is great and story is awesome. Totally worth the buy. Would totally buy again it is that good. Word.
4,"best of cable, more of the same from deadpool","if you already like deadpool then you will enjoy this. if you've never really cared for cable, give him a chance here. i don't think cable has ever been more kick-ass in his career. this is the highest he's ever shined and is certainly a lot more interesting than the big dumb soldier he's left to be in his current adventures in the future."
5,"A Great Book for Fun and Education! A review of ""Bamboozled""","Arggh. Another great book that is hard to get a-hold of. What gives?!?This is a great, fun book that both my kindergartener and I love. [My three year-old finds the pictures disturbing as they do not correspond to `reality'. It's a stage-lol].In any case, this book is really silly and fun and has allowed both my daughter and I to improve our observational skills. Indeed, as other reviewers have said, there are many visual illusions and allusions. (Many of the pages refer to popular and classical artwork. A chance for me to show my daughter the originals.)Five Stars. It's a treasure. Kindergarteners and older children will like the silliness. Mom's and other caregivers will like that kids get to practice paying attention to detail."
5,Wonderful Book,"I first read this book at my dentist's office and loved it. I could not find it in any bookstore, but was so excited when I found it on Amazon. It is a must read for any child or adult."
4,Happy Camper,I purchased this controller used and I'm very happy with the item. The controller is in excellent condition (like new) and well worth the price paid.
1,bad stick,"This stick was garbage from the moment I received it. As soon as i start up the game it tells me that the controller is not plugged in all the way. I tried going into control panel and recalibrating it, but nothing works still. I will be returning this."
3,"its a controller not a game, but its more fun to play with more people","its a controller not a game, but its more fun to play with more people"
4,Great Resource,"This book is a great resource for how-to information, ideas for fundraisers, plus forms to use for everything - only thing I would have liked would have been a CD to use instead of the disk that was included. This book will prove very helpful in my business!"
2,Not EventS...but Event...,"While there is some great advice to be gleaned from the book, the majority of the book focuses on selling you on producing a specific type of event. Unless you want to follow their step-by-step advice and create that same event, you will find this book a disappointment as I did. I don't believe that the book lives up to its billing. Unlike the authors, I don't agree that there is a single perfect fundraising event for all organizations."
2,I thought I accidently ordered the wrong book.,"...There are good tips and checklists, but the majority of the book concentrates on one type of event, one the writers specialize in called a ""Dynamite Dinner."" Other events are mentioned in passing, but unless you want to create a ""Dynamite Dinner,"" I'd look elsewhere for help."
3,pleasant guide to la belle Provence,I used this book for a trip to France last year. It was accurate. It was very detailed. It a had the best information about this small area of France.
2,Not Very Useful,"I tried it for about 3 weeks. Stuff gets stuck inside it, and my phone gets dirty. Because of the case the dirt/leaves/grime that sometimes gathers in my pockets or on my car seat get caught under the case and stays there. I have a concern about dirt getting caught under the case and scatching up my phone. I could take a picture with it on, but it didn't really protect my buttons from getting pushed accidentally. It didn't fulfill my expectations, really. The belt clip went really fast. It didn't break, it poked me and made the phone more difficult to handle. I took it off the first day. After about 3 weeks of having to take off the case and clean my phone, I took the case off for good. It might be okay for someone who's life is spotlessly clean. I have kids and dogs, so that isn't me."
4,Auto repair at its finest.,This manual far exceeds any chiltons manual I have ever purchased. The electrical diagrams were all there (broke down by year) with no questions left unanswered. The book entailed many helpful photographs not just sketched pictures. I did think they could have provided more color photos though. Overall I would reccomend this manual to any nissan maxima owner.
2,A Fascinating Relationship - a Disappointing Book,"André Gide and Oscar Wilde are two very fascinating and highly complex artists, and a study of their friendship is consequently a promising read.However, ""André & Oscar"" does not quite live up to its promise. The author does no more than place episodes of both authors' lives next to each other and never really explores the profound influence that Oscar Wilde, at the time of their meeting the middle-aged High Priest of Decadence, had on both the life and artistic convictions of the young timid Protestant André Gide.The book simply isn't deep enough. One gets the impression that the author wanted to write a popular book about a subject that is not actually fit for such a shallow approach. The literary friendship of Oscar and André is important enough to deserve a more thorough study."
5,A-FRICKIN-MAZING!!!,"This is probably the best arcade translation on the 2600! It won the 1981 Electronic Games Magazine ""Game of the Year"" award. You get 6 cities to defend (just like the arcade), three sets of nuke-blasting ICBMs (ony one base, as opposed to the 3 bases in the arcade), and all of the enemies (nukes, smart bombs, satellites, and warplanes) from the arcade! You will not be disappointed with Missile Command on the Atari 2600!"
3,An Okay port,"I love this game. I love the arcade that uses the track ball. The problem I have most is that it seems unbeatable. I guess I should look for an updated mod of this game. On the atari VCS( Video Computer System/ 2600) the pixels are rectangular so your cursor is a rectangle...I don't know if that makes much of a difference. The game is worth it for the 2600, but I feel that it makes it tough into an unbeatable situation. I do love to play the game and it makes nice practice if you are going to try to get the high score of the arcade and it does have the final explosion to signify failure. It does work on the 7800."
5,One of the two albums to get.,"If you weren't looking for a ""Best of America"" album, it was very hard to find these albums on CD in the USA for a long time. Finally they are readily available via Amazon.com. If you want to own original albums by America and not buy them all, the two albums to get are Hearts and Holiday. They contain almost all the recognizable songs you heard on the radio by them ,plus you get several other nice ones. They are both excellent. All the other albums are just OK containing one or two hits with the rest of the material marginal."
4,great condition-- looks like it has some great hikes in it,Haven't used it yet-- but hopefully this book is as useful as it looks! This summer will be the real test.Thanks!
2,Read the reviews before you buy.,"I should have read the reviews a little more carefully before I bought this book.Kinda boooooring....a moderate amount of misinformation. Not that the misinformation mattered.This book wasn't really educational, fun,or informative. Just- blah.I did get my copy for a penny plus shipping. Worth the price, I guess."
2,"Totally engrossing, But not completely factual.","Oh my! I read this book cover to cover. It was wonderfully engrossing...However I highly recommend taking ALL facts with a grain of salt.I knew very few of the trivia bits presented among the plethora of ""facts"" this book contains. However, I found that the few I did know and had previously researched or read about were completely flawed in this book.Example: John Lennon's death was infact December 8, 1980. NOT 1979 as stated in this book.This is a widely known fact, and easily checked.Anyway. Final Exits is entertaining, but I would seriously fact check anything you read in it."
2,"Collector's Edition, anyone?","This is not a review of Warcraft III, which I think is excellent and would consider giving 5 stars to. This is a review of this specific gift set, which I think is a waste of money.This gift set includes only 2 things that are worth buying - the actual game, and the cinematics DVD, both of which can be found in the Collector's Edition. The collector's edition also includes the exclusive soundtrack CD (worth its weight in gold to any true Warcraft fan), an extremely high quality ""Art of Warcraft"" book, and a collector's edition manual signed by the development team.The strategy guide is fairly worthless, because the game is not difficult enough to justify use of one, not to mention that there are better sources of strategy online, and Warcraft II is not recommended for anyone, especially since most people who buy Warcraft III already have Warcraft II."
3,"Good appetizer, but not a meaty dish","While this book projects a basic overview of the investigative profession, it lacks thorough treatment of techniques and issues. McMahon does deserve kudos for devoting a chapter to ethics. Unfortunately, like many other books in this category, the author indulges in a lot of superficial introductory information and glosses over sources. This book and Brandon Perron's, are probably the most well thought-out books covering this field to date...but please, we implore you authors, to cut out the fluff and drive home more substance: tried and proven techniques, detailed (and updated) source listings (including databases and public records info) and more practical business advice. A conditional buy."
4,"This is a good, servicable part","As with everything that Timken makes, this proved to be a very good replacement part that fit correctly and functions as intended."
4,Give it 3 listens and you'll be hooked.,"I like Lady Luck the best, followed by 6ft Bong, I mean Crest..."
1,creepy,"I really wanted to like this album, I like the actual tigers. I listened to it over and over, just hoping it would grow on me. This album just creeps me out. I fell asleep while listening to it and had terrible dreams. Usually I'm a fan of the tragic ballads, but this lives up to it's name in a very negative way. I actually threw it in the trash. And what I assume are real bird feathers inside the case? to creepy!"
3,"Good in every respect, inspiring in none","Barenboim can't hope to compete as a conductor with the likes of Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, or even Esa-Pekka Salonen, all of whom have made inspiring Das Lieds. He has good soloists--this is Meier's best outing on disc in the mezzo part--and of course a virtuoso orchestra. It adds up to a good performance that fails to scale any heights."
5,What A Great Love Story!,"Scarlet Bride is a beautiful love story that proves love is sweeter than revenge and more precious than gold. Conner (the hero) was a wonderful combination of a southern gentlmen and a rake. If I couldn't have him in real life, I'm glad Alex (the heroine) captured his heart in Ms. McDaniel's rendition of the majestic old South."
4,scarlet,"It was an esay read and I enjoyed the story, but could have done w/o the graphic details referenced in the second novel. I believe the other refernces in the book give an adequate picture of the circumstances of the relationship."
4,Good story,"My title says it, i think. Its a very enticing story, I honestly did not expect it to be that good."
4,ebook editor needed,It was a good story. The book contained no hyphens and many errors like numbers at the beginning of a paragraph. The errors were a distraction to the story. I had to look up what a bride tobe was. Then I relaized it should be bride-to-be. Where's the editor?
4,Great western and love story,This was a great love story plus a great western. I read her 3 series of books and read this one knowing I would like it too
3,Entertaining,"This book was entertaining. Do I think it will win any awards for best book ever? Nope. I was able to get into the story line and enjoyed the characters. I did get this book for free, I dont know if I would feel the same way if I had to pay full price for it."
1,Not worth it - even at that price,The story is poorly written and a complete waste of time. Save your money for something worth the price. This isn't it.
3,Age level is important,"Many age groups like to play knee hockey. From age 4-50 plus. Mostly 8-16 year olds. This product is good for younger children who love hockey around the ages of 4-8. The mat doesn't lie perfectly flat, so it's not really functional for older children. It's good for young children who can pretend they are on a real ice rink and don't mind the bumps caused by the mat not lying flat."
2,Seems like a great idea...not,"Seemed like a great idea the kids play a lot of knee hockey so I thought this would be a great idea so their knees wouldnt get so sore. I was wrong, sure its softer on their knees but they cant even use it because it doesnt fold out flat. When you unroll its all bumpy and creased so you cant even play on it because the hockey ball hits a bump and goes flying the opposite way. It also has no way of staying put unless you put it on the carpet, which means you wouldnt need it for padding anyway. Dont waste your money"
4,great fun,"I purchased this for my son who LOVES to play hockey. The knee hockey sets are awesome and this mat adds and extra appeal to playing. It is meant for in the house and I cannot see that it would be suitable for outside play. It rolls up nicely which is great for storage. The only downside to that is, it is difficult to keep flattened. Regardless, my son has a blast with it and likes to get it out to show off for his friends."
1,Not worth the money!,Our neighbors had one of these mats so I bought it for my 3 year old son. It is just a thin sheet of foam. Not weighted in anyway and moves all over the place while he's playing. Plus it bunches up and the foam balls won't roll across it. I remember the neighbors mat having a thick rubber underside so it couldn't bunch up and move around.
2,Not for the serious help author,"This book has potential, but when it comes to offering the needed information, it just isn't there. For instance, there is a section where all the macros in WinHelp are listed. If you know anything about Macros, they have parameters and these parameter have very specific formats, allowable entries, etc. While the macros are listed, there's no explanation of the parameters. In addition, finding the information that *is* there is difficult, because the index is inadequate.This reference book is not for the experienced help author. If you are really trying to ""get under the hood"", this book isn't going to help. I have found the WinHelp On-Line HAG to be a much better reference than this."
3,relly like 3.6 stars. i give it a C.,"Ok this CD is not as good as his last one. He shoulda stuck to singing instead to trying to rap. Ok this is not a bad CD so please dont misunderstand me bc it's got some good stuff on it but his first one had more of an ol school soul vibe to it. This one he tried hard to fit in with that in crowd. There are some tight tracks such as the lead single(it's you), i refuse, my block, and i also like that cut wit track daddy. there were other songs i like but those are the 4 best. If you have his first album which was awesome you will see why this one is getting lower ratings."
5,Awesome,"The cd is really, really great. I was so impressed with this young man that I purchased two of the same cd so I would'nt be caught anywhere without a copy. Thanks for the really great music and I can relate to what you are saying."
5,EXCELLENT,"This is an excellent CD. It is one of the best CD's I've heard in several years. Urban Mystic is comprised of real singers -- not studio singers. I bought the CD for the song ""I Refuse"". But I am happy to report that there are several songs just as good or better. The song ""Where Were You"" is one of the best songs I've heard, bar none. Buy this CD now. This CD will enhance any music collection."
4,Panasonic TH-42PS9UK 42,"Excellent picture. Good price. Just $999.00 plus $154.00 shipping. But, no tuner, no tv stand, no speakers. You decide!!!"
4,Home fried,"The Delonghi deep fryer is pretty awesome. This method of cooking beats the fry pan, which spatters hot oil and takes longer to cook. The only drawback is volume; a larger device (maybe gallon/2 liter) would allow for ""party-size"" menus. The price was very good at 60% off!"
4,christmas gift for other,I gave 3 of these games away as Christmas gifts to guys over 30. They liked it and even the kids did. Screen is too small. Lots of games and easy to play.
4,Nice birthday gift for my 5yr old Godchild,"I got this as a gift for my God Son who will be 5. It says 6 and up but he is advanced for his age. You don't get to pick the color that comes I so hoped it would be green as he loves green, unfortunately it is pink. OH WELL. He loves the frogger game.The item is sturdy for the price and the games look fun for a small child. I cannot speak for how long it will last. He tends to be gentle with things so I think I'm safe there. What else could you get under $XX can't say but it was good. that a kid would like more.Also the games are clean safe for a chold his age."
4,Small and several games,"Great for road trips, make sure the kids have earphones because they can be noisy. They're small and have retro games. My kids really like theirs."
4,Glad to find this,"This is one of my sister's favorites. She got hooked on it years ago when you could still pick it up cheap in a local discout store. Now it is getting harder to find.My sister requested this for her birthday and I found it on Amazon. Since she and I have like tastes in perfume, I thought I would like to try it too, so I bought two bottles and kept one.It is a wonderful smelling eau de toilette. I am glad I bought myself one. My sister was really happy I found it for her. There is just one issue. I noticed when the bottles arrived one was leaking a little, so I kept that one and gave her the other one. When she opened it, hers was leaking a little too.. hence the 4star rating rather than a 5 star.But the smell of it is worth losing a little. The bottle is too big to carry in your purse, so I just make sure I am careful with it."
1,be warry,"I got this product and I was so thrilled after receiving it as it is really cheap as compared to how much I originally buy it. Problem is when I tried using the product , I got rashes a day after to the area where I sprayed it. I thought I got the rashes from the food that I ate so ignored the thought. The next time around I sprayed it in my back having the idea that it could be this perfume which has caused me the rashes. True enough after a day or so ... I got rashes in my back where I sprayed the perfume.I can't find my receipt as I intend to return this . But please be cautious. I could be wrong but instances had made it clear for me. I've been using this brand for a year and it is only this time and with this product that came that I got the rashes. Strange but this is something to be checked not unless my body got sensitive too much on its strong fragrance"
1,BEWARE!!!!!,Knowing that I live in the United States (Region 1) the company sent me a Region 2 DVD. I am now out the purchase price and am stuck with a disc that doesn't play on DVD players manufactured in the United States.
5,discover again,"I saw D.A.R.Y.L. when I was avery little girl and 11 months ago I saw it again and I was charmed. I started looking for informations about this film.It was no easy!Now I have fond your sit I am happy!""Short circuit"" as an other customers said is a film which can be compared with D.A.R.Y.L.I think it is a good film so.In my opinion D.A.R.Y.L. is a reflexion about Artificial Intelligence and the science which is trying,today,to make machines as much intelligente as us.Also it is enjoyable to have make this excellent film with a little boy.Contact me if you want discuss about it."
5,FINALLY! - PURE 80's FARE!,"Engaging, heartwarming and intelligent film that makes you think ""What If?"". Saw this when it opened and have liked it ever since but this DVD release was way overdue. Have watched in on laserdisc many times. Watch this, ""Wargames"" and ""The Manhattan Project"" for pure eighties escapism!"
5,Classic,This is one of those classic 80's movies that still holds up. I know some of them don't but this one did.
5,Great Movie,"Great Movie, Great Shipping, thank you Amazon!This is one of my family favorites and always a great watch! It was an original idea in some ways kind of predictable, but in the end... VERY cool!"
4,Olde but a goodie,Daryl is about a kid who finds himself in a strange place with a supposed memory loss only to find out he's a science project. A family who is desperate to have a child of their own takes him in only to have him taken away supposedly by his real parents. Yet another feel good movie but it delivers in my opinion.
3,Different,"I bought this book for a gift but decided not to gift it, its somewhat tasteless and lame. I was hoping for funny."
2,"Cute and funny, but it's not a potty training book.","Note:When I first obtained this book I made the assumption that it was a potty training book, and I wrote the review below. Someone pointed out that this book doesn't necesarily advertise itself as a potty training book. It's just a funny story. OK, that's fair. I can't change the stars but I do see the point. I suppose if I saw it just as a funny book for children I'd give it more stars.-------------------------------------------------This is not a book that actually teaches anything about using the potty. This is a funny book about a little boy who is repeatedly asked if he needs to go potty and says ""no no no"" but later has to ""go"" in the most inconvenient of circumstances. We've all been there, haven't we parents?But this book doesn't train at all. If you want a funny book to share with a little boy who needs potty training, you may like this, but if you want a book that will help instruct a child, look elsewhere."
3,Just Okay,I just find this book a little strange. Just too much focus on urinating and not much of a story.
5,Excellent Service,"This book was perfect for a grandchildren gift. No one can write quite like Robert Munsch. It seems he actually ""lives"" in children's heads!"
5,anonymous 9 yr old,"I gave this book a rating of 5 stars because it is funny. He goes to his Grandma and Grandpa's and he yelled ""I have to go"" and he keeps saying ""I have to go"". He leaves you hanging behind."
3,"Entertaining to watch, but you won't learn much","This video is really nice to watch, and it has many songs and the dancer changes dresses for the different songs and so for. However, you won't really learn much about accompanying flamenco dance. Mr Serrano explains a couple of things but they are not enough, and mostly what he does is play what he would do in a dance guitar duet, but you can't learn by just watching them."
5,Great!,Product was great and molds came out excellent. Just be aware there are small parts so have the proper equipment to fill those parts.
3,The Prolific Bradbury,"This book is worth having, if only for ""The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair."" It is one of the best short stories I have ever read."
5,Must read for those in love with life,"Ray Bradbury's tales in this book are both inspiring and entertaining. My favorite aspect of these stories is that in many of them, Bradbury seems to take a common event and throw a slight twist of science fiction into story. Each story paints a picture that part of me takes to heart everytime I read it."
3,Lovely stones but big setting,"While the price was terrific and the colors of the stones were beautiful, the setting juts out too far. The earrings droop. Even with a flat disc back I thought too much of the setting showed and dwarfed the stones."
3,Cloudy peridot,"These earrings are very pretty, the citrines being my favorite, but the peridot earrings are cloudy and look like cheap plastic. I was very disappointed but I love all the other earrings and I don't know if I can return just one pair so I guess I'm stuck with them."
3,some items OK,"Blue topaz is practically colorless. Amethyst is a bit paler than on the photo, other items are nice. Overall I am satisfied because the price is OK even if I get only 3 out of 5 which are useful."
1,oversized mounting,"The pictures of these earrings are beautiful, but deceptive. The mountings are huge and heavy making the earrings hang low. The studs do NOT want to sit squarely on the earlobe, but fall downward. The mountings are WAY too large/tall for the stones. I had to return them because they look terrible on."
3,Too Beautiful but Too Big,"The stones in these earrings are stunning. Good cut and quality, lovely colors to go with your entire wardrobe. However, the settings are so large and stand out from my earlobe so far that you can't see the stones, just the silver setting. I'm sure it's a combination of the size of the earring and the shape of my ear, but I'm really disappointed that I don't wear these lovely little gems as much as I had intended. If you have larger earlobes perhaps these would be the perfect studs for you. But if you have smaller ears, beware."
4,Great Value for the Set,The earrings arrived 2 or 3 days after I bought them when they were on sale with the gold box special. They were a great value. My only complaint was that the blue topaz and the purple amethyst were very light in color.
5,Couldn't be happier!,"I ordered these for our daughter's 21st birthday and they will be a fantastic gift. I bought them on Black Friday, so they were less expensive than the price that they are listed at now, but even at the higher price they are well worth it. They are the perfect size for studs and look way more expensive than what I paid for them. I will probably get a set for myself, again, even at this higher price. Pay the extra for two-day shipping and get them for someone for a Christmas gift...guaranteed they won't be disappointed."
2,Not impressed,"My daughter doesn't seem to be wearing them and when I showed her the picture she dosn't remember getting them, so I guess she wasn't impressed. I don't think they cost very much, and that looks like a good thing now."
2,What do you expect for the price?,"While the earrings were in perfect condition, they had no brilliance to them. They're not brilliant like the photos show. I can't imagine what I was thinking when I ordered them, $10 per pair of earrings for a successful attorney! If you don't have much money, they're a good deal, but I wouldn't use them as a gift. I felt so stingy afterwards that I returned them."
5,Awesome Earrings@,"I love these earrings and everything about them. They are beautiful gems and the ""filigree"" is lovely too. They fit nicely on my ears and they do not hang down if you put the back on tight enough. (Other reviews complain about them being top heavy.) A great buy!"
5,Fantastic!,"These are all the best of what everyone has already said. We purchased them for our daughter's 11th birthday. They are beautiful. I am keeping the Garnets for myself, they are the darkest of the lot. The colors vary from a pale blue of the topaz to the vibrant green and golden lemony yellow of the citrine and peridot. The stones are very clear with no visible flaws and the setting is a pretty little filagree look. These are an EXCELLENT set. I HIGHLY recommend them."
3,Good earrings for the price,Like the size and color of these earrings. Allows a nice variety of colors for the price.
3,Wish the basket setting could have been lower.,I bought these earrings in 2008 and they are still like new now. The shapes and colors of gems go with whatever you wear. My only complaint is the basket setting is kinda high which makes the earrings look bulky from sides and drop easily.
3,Colors not as pictured.,"The colors were not as shown in the picture. We didn't get a blue topaz stone; instead we got a dark, almost, emerald green stone. The other stones are just not a deep in color as shown. The earrings appeared to be well set and not loose in the setting. All in all, we were pleased based upon price and content."
5,Very nice,"Cute earrings, great price! I like the choice of colors, and the fact that each pair comes in a seperate box, which is a great idea for gift giving. These are heavier, not tiny, so they show up great. Some reviews state that these do not work well with some lobes, but I am lucky that I am able to wear earrings without sagging or drooping. I do have sensitvie ears, and have been able to wear them all day & night without any irritation. My ears are double pierced, these work well in either site."
4,Great for the price,"These are certainly not subtle; the stones are medium-sized and very prominent. The prongs appear very sturdy, and I don't expect them to come off for a long time, which makes them ideal for day-to-day wearing."
4,"Nice earrings, but packaging is lacking.","I bought these for my niece for Christmas because I thought they were a nice versatile set, but not too flashy for an 11 yr old. I am very pleased with the appearance of the earrings, but was a bit disappointed in the packaging. They come in a box, within a bag, but each pair is in a little plastic zip loc bag. These could really look much more appealing if they were presented a little better. Still, I think they were a good deal."
3,Decent earrings,"The stones are very nice and the settings are decent quality, but I agree with other reviewers who have noted that they stick out rather far on the earlobes. The settings are just too deep, and it gives them a rather awkward look when worn--to my eyes anyway. They're not really bad, but just not anything special. If you don't mind the deep setting, then they are pretty good quality for the money when you can get them at Gold Box prices."
4,Beautiful stones and settings.,"I just got these earrings for Xmas and they are so pretty! The other reviewers are right that they are a bit heavy in their deep settings, but perhaps the earring backs with the discs would help those people who have trouble with them drooping. The earrings work okay for me. The stones are clear and beautiful and the settings are very pretty and scroll-like. I love that they're all different shapes. A good value!"
4,Great size and cut,My only complaint is the peridot. It is cloudy. All the other stones were clear and brilliant. Flat backs would have been best.
5,Totally worth it!,"Finally! Something that's worth its price! I have bought a lot of jewelries online and I've come to accept that most of them do not appear as good as the photos but this one is just extraordinary! The gems don't look a small as I expected them to be and it even looks better when worn. Each of the five earrings is encased in a cute black box so I didn't have to worry about buying extra cases. I especially love the garnet pair because of its rich red hue. It doesn't look dark and blackish like other garnet-mounted earrings are. It's also an ideal gift if you plan on buying jewels for someone special without spending a hefty sum. The great thing about is that I can wear it everyday for work, and choose between the darker shades to be worn at dinner parties and night outs."
1,Not well made.,"Right after receiving these, I decided to take a look at them.They are beautiful, and look very nice. Unfortunately, they are not very well made.The post broke off one of the Garnet earrings when I pulled the butterfly clasp off the post to remove the earring from the sponge. The post wiggled a little when I was pulling off the clasp, and when I tried to put the clasp back on, the post completely broke off.I tested the other earrings immediately. The posts didn't break off, but the butterfly clasps are hard to remove from the earrings, so if you're not really careful, I have a feeling that there will be more broken-off posts after some time."
5,A LOVELY GIFT,"I bought this pretty set of earrings as a gift for a friend, and when they arrived very promptly and in a nice presentation case, I was well impressed. The recipient is very happy with these earrings, all of which she wears. This set is outstanding value for the money."
5,Nice variety,"Gave this set to our 11-year-old daughter for Christmas, since she'd recently had her ears pierced and was desperate for earrings. Nice quality for the price, and a great way to start her off."
2,Earrings,"These are nice, no doubt. Although, you get what you pay for. One of these ""the blue topaz"" ..well they are extremely light blue.......and the citrine....is a joke, because one is extremely ligther than the other. That is pathetic!"
4,Nice variety,"I got my ears pierced several months ago and I've been trying to find some nice earrings for my collection. I saw these, read the positive reviews and decided that, for the price, I would get them. They arrived within a few days in five separate boxes. The stones are very pretty and now I have something to go with any outfit. I have rather fat earlobes so I had no trouble with drooping. The setting is higher than most, but I think it's because the settings are nice also so why not show them."
2,Please heed negative reviews regarding drooping on the ear!,"I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund."
5,Great value,"The gemstones are a nice quality and cut, very clear and well colored in solid silver settings. They are packaged to be able to break them up into 5 separate gifts or give together. This is a very attractive, high quality earring wardrobe for the money."
5,"Good quality, great price","I bought this 5-pack of earrings for my girlfriend when it was on sale for about 75% off. I'm no expert, but the studs seemed to be of high quality and the gemstones were bigger than I thought they would be. My only regret is that I gave her all five sets at once, instead of gifting them one at a time! Anyway, she loves them. I would definitely recommend these studs."
2,"Small, fragile, indifferently colored","I guess I was expecting too much after reading all the great reviews. However, I was SOO disappointed after opening the boxes. The stones are small and get lost on my ears--and I don't have particularly big ears. The settings are thin and bendy. Here are my comments regarding each set:Garnet: Too dark. When they're on my ear, you can hardly notice that they're red. They look almost black.Amethyst: Too light. They're almost pinkish, and don't look like amethysts at all.Blue topaz: Too light. The color is washed out and almost unnoticeable.Citrine: Again, washed-out. The color is more yellowish than orange.Peridot: This is the only set with which I'm even the slightest bit happy with. Nice lime-green color.All in all, I wish I'd spent my money on something else."
5,Even better than I expected,"Was very please with product. Stone sizes are larger than I expected and I think a great deal for the price. I had no problem with the setting being too large for my ear lobes. Overall I was very please with the color, shapes, looks, size, and especially the price of this set. Would recommend to friends ( I already have)."
3,beautiful stones,"Got two sets, one for each daughter. The earrings are beautiful just wished that they said genuine or sterling ... somewhere! Boxes made it look like they we just cz's"
3,kept the fungus down,"We continued vets program with weekly baths has gotten the problem under control and we are continuing the program, much to the dogs dismay."
1,I am not happy with the company service. It is still an issue. It is not resolved with the company.,I am not happy with the service from the company. It is not resolved at all. When I received the product I declined it and sent it back to sender. They did not refund my money or send the product back to me if it cannot be returned back to them. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.
4,Good stuff,We have a dog who seems to get far stinkier than the others like her and we've since learned she has high amounts of yeast on her skin which contributes to the funk. We use this on her and she stays less smelly for a longer period of time. We also use in the winter for itchy skin and it helps with that as well.
5,Five star for Malaseb Shampoo,Great product for dogs with dry and itchy skin. A must have for fast relieve and quick results.
4,Good shampoo,"I've used this shampooMalaseb Shampoo 12ozfor an older shar pei who has skin problems resulting in fungal infections. It does work in minimizing the itching and odor but does not completely get rid of the fungus. In fact, meds she is on does not do it either. But this shampoo, used as directed, once a week, does help a great deal."
5,fantastic dog shampoo!,"When we first got our pug, he had a horrible skin infection. we took him the the vet, who gave us this shampoo to use. The vet recommended we give him a bath once a week with it, until the infection cleared up. Shortly after, the infection was gone and hasn't come back since. We continue to use this shampoo for his baths and it does wonders for his skin and coat. His coat feels so soft and healthy. We constantly get compliments on it. After using this shampoo, I would never use anything else for my dog."
5,Great Engagement Gift,"I received a waterford ring holder when I got engaged, and since then have continued to give as gifts. Love their designs and the price is very reasonable."
2,Carefull...,"I ordered this book to help me migrate from development on Linux to development on Windows CE. I found errors in the first 10 minutes of reading! (Page 249, 1/986 and 1/147 are both wrong. Refer to the NMEA 0183 spec for details.)Between the errors, the lack of coverage of PPC2002, and the blatent omission of anything interface specific, my recommendation is to wait for another book to get published. Especially if you want something that covers GUI - this does not.Unfortunately, I must also say that this is the best book out there, at least that I've been able to find (WinCE/eVC++). So I guess that makes it a winner! ....but only by default."
1,Code does NOT work for Handheld PC 2000,"I bought the book with the intention of trying out the example code on my Jornada 720 (running Handheld PC 2000 which is CE3.0).Even though the book title explicitly calls out ""CE 3.0"", the example code (examples.vcw) does NOT even compile for Handheld PC 2000 (I have the HPC 2000 SDK Released Version Jan/23,2001 installed).I emailed the Embedded VC++ compiler error messages to the authors and heard nothing back."
5,Great reference but not for beginners,"This book is a great Windows CE reference. The material and examples are comprehensive, clear and concise. But do not use it as an introduction to eVC++ because there is virtually nothing on the user interface or the basics of MFC. If you are a C++ or VC++ programmer, and you want to become functional in a hurry with Windows CE 3.0, I strongly recommend it. Also, unlike a previous reviewer, I found the author to be very responsive to questions."
2,Disappointing,"Surely a good book, the problem is that the cover page gives the wrong impression. In five points the content is declared, but two of them are summing up to one and a half pages! There is nothing about window handling or any other type of user interface, almost nothing about MFC, and nothing about using Embedded Visual C++! The book is only about systems programming in the Windows CE API, and that was not what could be expected."
4,Sometimes makes you dig for the info...,"I'm currently using the book to develop. It's a good book with plenty of examples to start you off. No white space and the examples are short and to the point. The only real grip I have is that it tends to occationally use the wrong word. For example, in Ch5 on Processs and Threads it say:""An application can create additional threads...""Call me picky, but technically the word should be 'process' not 'application'. An application (per the book) is the .exe in the object stores. Only when the application runs is a process create..."
5,Excellent disc and a must for SACD collectors,"Absolutely delivers on its SACD promise. Super balanced and properly weighted. A sonic delight and glad I found it. Basses mix well and accentuate the higher pitched instruments without dominating. Conversely, the higher register voices do not overtake the lower notes. This disc is a steal. Recording is spot on; no hiss, extraneous noise and the vocals are clear and haunting, as they should be."
2,Okay for play,These are nice and fun but don't expect them to last very long. They are not made to last- perhaps for a one time costume is best.
5,My boys love these,"Perfect for any aspiring ninja. My boys, ages 4 and 7, both enjoy these as part of their ninja costumes and also alone."
4,ninja weapons,"In spite of missing parts and the weapons not looking exactly like the picture provided, I would not hesitate to make another purchase from Amazon. Not only did they quickly replace the missing items, but their correspondence was almost immediate. My 6 year old grandson practiced his ninja skills all night. I also purchased 2 costumes which I have been told he sleeps in."
2,costume assessories,The weapon that is connected by the string broke immediately. It would have been nice if the sheath attached to a belt. Saw this kit cheaper at a local store.
1,Appalling,"This is a personal opinion, but appalled is the only word I can use to describe this. And it's not really that musically interesting to me. The singing is excellent, but the story and the music.. that's another thing. Again, I know many people like it, but this is just not my cup of tea."
3,Everything but the Music,"I thought that the book would include some of the sheet music to the songs which i enjoy so much, but it does not. You basically get a copy of the script with lyics to the songs (not much different from the booklet that accompanies the CD)."
5,Hysterical Reference for the Surfin'Culture,"I bought the original version of this book as a Christmas gift when it was released in 1991. It was so funny, I always intended on getting a copy for myself. I couldn't find a copy after that Christmas and it seemed to go out of print really quick. I have been looking for a used copy ever since. I was really ""stoked"" (buy the book to read a definition of ""stoked"") when I checked the web for used copies of the original that there was a new version out! I'm going to buy one and two more for gifts right after I finish this review. Although it's technically a reference book, I actually read it cover to cover before I wrapped it as a gift. I couldn't put it down. I found it fun, easy, and entertaining to read. Even a surfer could read it! (Just kidding. Chill out, Dude!)"
5,Got for my Mom....,My Mom absolutely loves these!!! She has them in her truck still!! She proudly displays them to anyone that gets into her truck. Very good quality and very sturdy!! The Elvis looks great even after a year!!! I would highly recommend these to any Elvis fan and I would buy them again!!! Thanks!!
4,Sweet!,"I LOVE Fumi Kosaka's art and illustrations! A style all her own, really appealing and sweet for children."
5,A Fascinating Book on the Hebrew Origins of English,"This is a really fascinating book. I have often wondered why the etymology sections in dictionaries stop at the ancient Greek or Latin and only very occasionally go back to more ancient languages like Arabic or Sanskrit. Mozeson has collected English words which he claims have clear connections to the Hebrew. For example the (Hebrew) word ""marah"" is found in the Bible to mean mirror, ""derekh"" means trek or track, ""deo"" means die and so on. Some of the connections might seem teneous but most are real eye openers. Oh, and in case you are worried Mozeson is not a fundementalist Bible basher although it must be said that according to Jewish tradition Genesis 11:1 refers to the Hebrew Language (look it up) which would make it the orignal language. Mozeson has written other books on slang language and on teenagers. If you are not at least a little familiar with Hebrew this book will be of less interest to you."
3,good for the money,this will be enough for any small jobs inside the house. the holes at the top for tools saves a lot of time. it's a good feature.
1,Takes a long time to get this from Amazon,"I ordered this ladder 12 days ago and still don't have it. The delivery estimate said I would have it a couple of days ago. Today is the day I need it. Just a word of warning if you need to use a ladder by a certain date, don't trust the delivery estimate."
3,Great Ladder - Not-So-Great Packaging,"The ladder is high-quality, sturdy and just what I wanted to replace my shaky, old wooden one but Amazon packaged it in a high-density plastic bag that was taped to conform to the ladder's shape. Unfortunately, it had been cut or ripped and one of the bottom feet damaged. The mediocre rating reflects the damage, rather than the ladder itself."
2,MADE IN CHINA,I was disappointed to find out that this ladder is MADE IN CHINA. I had special ordered this locally. It never left the store with me. When I saw the made in China tag I asked for a refund. Now I am searching the web for a two foot ladder made in USA. The job I save may be your childs job. I am leaving this review for anyone else like me who wants to do their small part to support US manufacturing.
3,Werner 6004 4' Type 1 250 pound fiberglass stepladder,"Item as described in words but the picture is misleading. I thought the ladder would look like the picture but it's not. Overall, the item is as described in words."
3,Curve Kabob,"Skewers work ok, they take some getting use to though. Due to the flat design,smaller items that would fit on a round bamboo skewer will split apart on this skewer.Use big pieces of food and you'll be happy, they look great on the plate!"
5,Excellent Chilling Portrait of a Killer and an Era,"""The Todd Killings"" is a lyrical, visually striking, well acted, lesser scene thriller. This film is about a small California town, where a charismatic 23 year old named Skipper Todd (!)charms his way into the lives of high school age guys and girls. There is much talk of ""turning on"", random sex, Vietnam, and philosophical ramblings. The cast is astonishingly good, with many farmiliar faces including I believe the Mom from the tvshow the Wonder years. This film is also a freaky portrait of a cold blooded sociopath-Skipper Todd himself. No one suspects the fury that lies beneath his mask. There are many frightening images, such as the film's opening in which Todd and his hippieish friends callously bury a body. Amorality abounds in this great, not to be missed gem."
5,Tall sax stand,The stand arrived very quickly. It is well built and sturdy. I can adjust it to a height where I can play alto or tenor from the stand while wearing a guitar. It would also be good for someone with back or neck problems who needs to play or practice without a strap.visit [...] for another unique product
5,danger zone,This book is realistic fiction. I like this book because it is suspenseful and it is about basketball. This book is about a USA dream team that plays several different countries like Germany and Spain. I could tell you my favorite part but that would ruin the book if you haven't read it. I recommend this book to people who like sports and suspense
5,Danger Zone,I just read Danger Zone over the summer and really enjoyed it. I was up half the night reading because I got caught up in the book. Besides being about basketball I really thought it was a good story about becoming a better friend and knowing about people unlike you. The book was amazing and I would recomend it to anyone who wants to read a good book!
4,HOT TAMALE!,Danger Zone is a great book for an enthusiastic basketball fan! This book is basketball themed aswell as a cliffhanger type. This book shows a great amount of predudicy and racism by skin color. Intresting novel. Klass writes with a get-to-the-point touch! Funny and intresting!
4,ABVK,"Danger Zone is a good book. Jimmy Doyle the main character got invited to play on a teen dream team for the U.S.A. Jimmy left his mom, sisters, and girlfriend behind to play basketball in Italy with kids his age from all over. The book had good adventure. First, Jimmy was in a fight between him and his teammate, Augustus. Later on the games got more intense. The author did a great job describing the games. Later on after one game there was a threat and left the teen dream team in danger. Thats where the title fits in. The zone was at the last game when Jimmy and Augustus were scoring and know one could stop them. During that game you wanted to keep reading. The book was very well written."
5,small town hero big lesson learned,"jimmy is a small town hero which lives in Granham, Minnesota. He is picked of ten lucky people to be on the team dream team, which travels the world. As they arrive in Italy for the tournament they suceed to the second round. A player acted which was not permited and broke out a death threat between nazis and the united states teen dream team. Will Jimmy stay or will he go home? Read Danger the thrilling and adventurus book danger zone."
4,Hunchback Figure Stands with the Best or does He?,"This figure of Lon Chaney as Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame is near sensational. The likeness is incredible and the king of fools props are a nice touch. The only drawback is the figure cannot stand on its own. It needs to be supported by something else. Also the cape string broke when I tried to tie it, but don't let this deter you from purchasing a great action figure. No Lon Chaney fan should be without this. The Hunchback perhaps does stand on its own in triumph."
3,"Nice, but too small","My child is in daycare, so once I pack two outfits and burp rags in the interior compartment, it is stuffed. I have to carry diaper changing stuff in the feeding compartment. And then there is no room left for bottles.This would be a fine bag to use if I was just going shopping for a few hours, but for full time daycare it is just too small."
3,Zipper broke after 8 months,"We bought this and the larger matching bag, and the zipper broke after only eight months. We don't use the bag everyday, as we have two, so the breakage wasn't due to over-use. I love the size of the bag, but I'm very displeased with the quality of the closures. Just thought everyone should know."
3,Strap broke after only a couple months of use.,My wife and I chose this bag because we really liked the design of this bag. We wanted a lighter weight bag with an insulated section built in. Only problem is that the shoulder strap broke from the side seam after only a couple of months of carrying. Maybe this is a random incident but I felt I should post this just in case someone else had the same problem. Now we have to go out and buy a new diaper bag.It definitely discourages me from buying this brand again.
3,a little too small,"I found this bag at Babies R Us while registering. I thought at the time that it would be plenty big enough to hold everything I would need for one baby, especially since most places I go are local and short and I tend to pack minimally. Well, it is big enough to hold the bare essentials, but I found it too small once I added my wallet, keys, phone and sunglasses instead of carrying a purse. And if I wanted to add an extra blanket, clothes, or toys it was so stuffed I could barely get my hand inside. So even though it technically held everything, it was so packed that accessing it was a pain.However, I was reluctant to switch to a ""big"" diaper bag because I thought carrying a bigger bag would be an inconvenience. Well, I ended up returning it and getting the Eddie Bauer Hecker sport tote bag and while it is bigger to carry (though not the biggest size), it is actually less inconvenient, because I can access everything easily."
3,Great SMALL diaper bag!,"I bought this bag when I was expecting my second child. I wanted something smaller, but not this small. This is good for very short outings and that is about it. I am looking now for something alittle bigger. My favorite part of the bag is the front compartment where you put bottles, etc. It is insulated, which is nice. I only reccommend this bag to someone that won't be needing alot of space."
5,GOLD FEVER!!,"This is a very detailed book on the history of the 1715 fleet. The story is so well written it is hard to set this book down before the ending. In depth historical information and amazing illustration combine to make this a book of dreams, dreams that came true for a few and lost for many. It leaves many more dreams for me....""GOLD FEVER""...."
2,Cut Versions,"This cd has a lot of really good songs but most of them are cut radio version, the only full version for sure is american pie.FOOL IF YOU THINK IT'S OVER is the original version but it is also the cut shortend radio version, the only way to get the full version is to buythe original album it was on called whatever happened to benny santini."
5,Practical Exercise,"I bought the book in mid-February and read it over a three day period. There was a wealth of useful information particularly describing correct depth, presentation, rigging configurations and other tactics. The following weekend I went out with the expressed intent to use the author's techniques and was very successful, catching 8 rainbows, cutbows and a couple of fat browns. Maybe a good day anyway but was armed with some very good pointers.dpl"
3,7 Habits Sales Tape,"Granted, it's sales-focused, but it gives enough information for those considering Covey's training to see the breadth of its real-world results!"
1,Color Blind?,IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE. I'M NOT A DOG. I CAN SEE COLOR. WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ARTISTIC? SUCKS
2,"AWFUL packaging job, pure amateur hour.","First of all, this box is a great size because toploaders fit in perfectly for storage, the ""lanes"" are wide enough.My complaint here is for the seller DISCOUNT CARD SUPPLIES who sent this item to be loosely wrapped in Saran Wrap and it was completely bent and almost impossible to put together. I can't believe the horrible shipping job. The box looks like crap, it's all dinged up and bent in several places. I would not order anything from them again, it must be some twelve year old running that business."
5,Perfect for Magic cards,"Was looking for a storage unit for my husband's Magic cards. This was perfect. Had to look online to figure out how to build it, but once we watched a video it was easy to assemble."
2,Hard to assemble correctly.,The box arrived in pieces with no assembly instructions. I could not manage to get it assembled correctly. Major thumbs down.
2,"Simple, cheap and easy becomes bad and dangerous","How simple is 3 pieces of corrugated cardboard right? Well - they come shipped together by staples - those thick staples that are REALLY hard to get out. So - you try to pry them out - you cut your thumb open - and tear the box a bit (and I'm a pretty careful person). On top of that - Amazon ships this in a box about 10 times too big and stuffs it full of paper - so even if you're not a tree hugger you almost have to face-palm. Box is nice once you get it put together - but there was absolutely no need for them to come stapled together, in my opinion.If you don't care about dangerous, hard-to-get out staples - or about how eco-unfriendly the packaging will be - this is a very good box."
2,Not Made for Magic Cards,"I suppose it will serve its purpose but not as well as I'd hoped. It says in the product description that it's intended for storage of a variety of cards, including Magic cards. The rows are each about 1/2"" too wide for the cards so they shift back and forth in the rows quite a bit.Also be careful removing all of the staples from cardboard sheets before folding into the box shape - it will look like crap if you're not careful."
3,Overpriced,"I needed new boxes as I was running out of space. I spent a little extra to get what I thought was a quality item. Boy was I mistaken. The firmness of the cardboard was great. Some perforations were not completed leaving part of the folding lines unperforated. Fifty percent of my order (I ordered six boxes) were damaged. Be they bent corners, bent tabs, torn grooves or wear marks. One looked like someone set something heavy on it. I didn't like the design either. The space between walls was about three quarters to an inch too wide leaving too much room for cards to slide left and right. The locking tabs were too short. The box was pretty difficult to get it to lock but the lid was perfect.The quality of the material is great, the lid design was great, the box was mediocre."
3,Seriously?,"Fun fun fun. Came in a flat envelope, with no instructions. I have three pieces (not two) of cardboard, and no idea how to put them together. Because I felt bad enough about buying a cardboard box as is. Thanks. Thanks a lot."
5,Nephew loved this gift.,Bought this as a Christmas gift for nephew and he loved it. He is a big collector of Star Wars figures and was thrilled because he didn't have this one. Even his mom wanted to know where in the world I found it. Very happy I bought this.
5,Suffering of the Anabaptists,"The seventeenth century book ""Martyr's Mirror"" told the gripping story of Anabaptist persecution in Europe. This book tells both about the illustrator of ""Martyr's Mirror"" and a number of the martyrs featured in the larger text. Overall both an inspiring account of some Anabaptist martyrs (even to a person such as myself who is not Anabaptist) and a book for anyone interested in the illustrations of ""Martyr's Mirror""."
5,Incredible Power,"Powerful, powerful, powerful. This work is chilling and captivating. There is not a wasted syllable in it. The fact that all of the events in the play are real and the words to be spoken by the actors were in many cases actually spoken or written by the people involved makes this disturbing to say the least. If the script is this moving, I can hardly wait to see it performed."
2,The description does NOT match the actual product!,"The image and information given are false. This model of the Samsung Q1 Ultra runs on Windows XP Tablet PC, AND has an entirely different case design then the one displayed (just google it before buying)."
4,"Good, but lacking...","I wanted this book, since I first found it at my local bookstore. I finally got it, and I have to say that it does give you some pretty good tips. There are some parts that it leaves out though. Like how to exactly do a gradation on the skin. It just goes quickly over it. I use Flash MX 2004, and this book doesn't cover it. So some of the techniques they were conveying were troublesome for me because the Flash I use has things in a slightly different place. Not to mention, each of the artist have a different technique to how to use Flash. So take what's best for you and make up your own way. To get a true experience from this book I do recommend getting a graphical tablet (just like I need to do). I just hope the next book covers at least simple animations, such as blnking eyes, tapping foot, and maybe some hair blowing in a breeze or something. Get the book, it's enjoyable and educational for the people who are wanting to give coloring in a different format a try."
3,Great for the Manga weak on the Flash,"I am a big fan of these ""How to Draw Manga"" series. I bought this one primarly for the Flash techniques and I have to say it falls short on that topic. Although it covered Flash, it only covered it to the basics and spent a little too much time on the over all process and pages of barely dressed Bishoujo. Don't get me wrong the images in this book are amazing it just did not include the juicy gold nugget techniques and shortcuts I was looking for."
2,Didn't quite fit...,This cover appeared nicely made but fit waaay too tight on the NSX. I had to tug on it to just barely get it on the vehicle. Returned it and was given a no-hassle refund.
1,Disappointing,"I have to say that I found David Marshall's book a very difficult read indeed. His logic is confusing and hard to follow; and I found the ""evidence"" for his arguments unconvincing. Quite often I was left wondering where he got a quote, as the referencing was inconsistent and often, non-existent. My main question throughout reading this book was ""Where was his editor?"" The fact that this book was even printed, considering the amount of spelling, grammatical, and syntactical errors, is astounding! Disappointing."
1,The Tao of Christian Fundamentalism,"David M. Marshall believes that the vast, almost preternatural wisdom of Chinese culture is somehow fulfilled by the fundamentalist rendering of Jesus. Nor is China the only culture so blessed: he finds Jesus in virtually every other non-Christian civilization. China will find its own way, it does not ""need"" Christianity (a religion that is being painfully discarded in the West). Christianity will play a minor, boisterous role in China, just as it does in India and Japan. For anyone interested in the inner workings of the fundamentalist mind, this is a good read."
5,Travel Tales of Woe,"This series of books are the best! I tried to order the first one on my Kindle, but it wasn't available. I love to give these as gifts."
1,Lizzy and her pals should have stayed far away...,"Let's face it. One Day at Horrorland was no masterpiece. Why make a sequel? In fact, Lizzy and pals don't even ride ONE ride in this book. This book is a huge huge disappointment. The attractions are confused and boring. I think R.L.Stine should not have returned - or anyone else. I do not recommend this one."
5,YOU GOTTA READ THIS,"Liz, Luke and Clay get taken back to horrorland to make a t.v show on how scary horrorland. they have to face the mummy walk and draculas castle. It ends with a pretty scary ending. I reccomened this book to people who don't chicken out easily. this is one scary book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Sheer Ridiculousness,"this book is the definition of an unnecessary sequel. While this is supposed to be a sequel to One Day in Horrorland of the original Goosebumps series, this book retains basically nothing from its superior original other than important names. Horrorland was originally a theme park. However, the characters never encounter a single ride. Instead, they stumble through a bunch of half-baked, barely cohesive scenes involving an Egyptian pyramid, a dentist office, a sandy desert, and a magic show. The plot jerks along with all the focus of a drunk squirrel, and I found a sick pleasure just wondering what absurd thing is the author going to throw at me next? It might have been enjoyable as a kid, but this book is just literary junk food disguised as a children's novel. Despite finding some enjoyment from the absurdity of the plot, I can't recommend anybody pay money for this."
4,Indepth search into human creativity,"Dr. Etuk has compiled an excellent collection of facts and stories about human creativity.A must read for people who want to learn more about their creativity and the creativity of people they work with, lead, manage or team with."
5,Best Book Ever!,This is the best book I've ever read this year. It has transformed my life in every way. I wish every individual in this world would grab a copy of this book and help make this world a better place for all. I love the fact that it is well written and clear on Human Creativity. I'd recommend this book to everyone!
5,Food for the Soul,"""Great Insights on Human Creativity"" is indeed a book you want to return to, over and over again. It's brilliantly written and it could very well serve as a life manual. As a perpetual student of life,i appreciated Dr. Efiong Etuk inspirational description of the potential of human creativity and personal development. Definitely an excellent read."
5,Tiger Costume,"Colorful, delightful, and furry. My granddaughter was so happy to get it that she wants to wear it almost every time that she comes for a visit. It was purchased to wear in a Noah's Ark Parade and it may be used for Halloween also. I was concerned about the size when I ordered it, but it is made in such a way that it spans the sizes from 2T to 4T very well."
4,"Cute costume, liner is a little scratchy","It is a cute costume. It just fits my 3T sized two-year-old so I wouldn't suggest buying it if your child is already in 4T because it will probably be too small. That said, I had had difficulty finding a tiger costume that fit my tall for her age daughter, and this one does, so that in itself is a relief. The inside liner of this costume is kind of scratchy so your kid will probably need something underneath to keep them from getting the itchies. It's also a warm costume so if you tend to have warm Halloweens it could be a concern. My daughter loves how it makes her look like a tiger and often wears the head piece all by itself while ""Roaring"" at me."
1,Too Frustrating,"I bought this product wanting to scan my 12X12 scrapbook pages and then ""stitch"" them together. Forget it! It's hard to line up the pages, as well as the system kept locking up!"
4,Good piece - good performance,"I bought this recording because I was singing in the Ann Arbor Cantata Singers last spring and we were performing this work. Sometimes it is hard to understand a whole work and even the choruses without the context of the orchestra and soloists. That is especially true of this piece.It is a pretty good work and the audience seems to really like it. This recording is very good. It is in French so the narration isn't as useful to an English speaker. However, the drama of the voice and the narrator's phrasing do help even an English speaker understand something about how it should go.Honegger is one of those composers whose star isn't has high in the heavens as it once was. However, I think it should be higher than it is at present. He certainly was an able composer and this piece shows a lot of what he is capable of."
2,"Some good information, but poorly organized","This book tries to cover many aspects of photography from equipment selection to photo technique/composition to technical jargon to home dark rooms. However, I found the organization quite poor, with topics such as exposure popping up in various places and other inconsistencies. Also, the author has a definite bias and preaches it strongly. For example, he basically states that you cannot get good pictures from a point and shoot camera, which is certainly not true in all cases.Also, the information seems somewhat dated, as APS and digital are given zero coverage, and he discusses topics like manual film winding quite a bit.On a positive note, the chapters on different photographic specialties (macro, portrait, landscape, art, etc.) were well done and informative.If the writing and organization was tightened up, and new chapters on newer technologies were added, this would be a much better book."
1,Don't bother,"Perhaps this book's title is too accurate. It's very elementary, doesn't go into depth about anything and as a result, is not a good reference. Yes, it has the answers to basic photography questions but not much more. I haven't picked it up since I got my Kodak Guide to 35mm Photography."
4,Good for the very green,"This book is okay for those just starting to explore the camera. It's an almost-too-easy guide that is well-suited to complete novices, as the title suggests. It's actually ideal for younger people and those who've just bought their very first camera and want to start with the basic building blocks. For the rest of us it seems to miss out on the essential premise behind photography guides - how to compose and shoot a half-decent picture. I recommend John Hedgecoe's 'The Photographer's Handbook' - a much more comprehensive guide for multi-level photography skills."
2,Un useable,Received this product and hooked it up right away to try it out.The second time that I turned it on a strip burned out in the unit making it in operable.I would not recommend this low end device
1,Stuff doesn't work after 2 weeks,Had this plugged in the attic with a fan attached so I can remote control the fan to cool off the attic. Worked fine the first couple weeks and I didn't touch it for a while (about a month or so). Now it doesn't work at all. The light on the remote still comes on. So I went up to the attic and found the plug unit doesn't work. This is similar to a lot of the complaints I have seen before I purchased this unit. Now I am another one of those victims....
4,Powerful and outdoor for real,"After some research I stopped my choice at this unit and did not regret.- this is real outdoor unit, just follow installation instruction properly to avoid water damage (water loop)- it is powerful enough for most appliances (960 Watts)- it has four adjustable frequency channels- 150 ft range- standard 12V battery for remoteWhy four stars?It does not have ""on"" light and not all people use this unit for Christmas lights.It seems that unit is not UL Listed (OK for Christmas lights)"
1,"Not ""heavy duty""",Bought this to remotely turn on/off a small fan. It stopped working after about two weeks. And prior to that I needed to press the on and off buttons numerous times to get it to work at all.
3,Quality has decreased,I bought one of these about 6 years ago and it worked great on an outdoor fountain but the switch itself finally failed. I bought this one to replace it and found that the new remote does not have near as much range as the old. Luckily the old remote can work on this new switch so I don't really use the new remote fob.
1,Short of range advertized,Did not work as advertized. Range was only about 70 Ft. was suposed to be 150 Ft. I have returned it.
3,Works ok,"for the money - works greatafter a few months, the range decreased significantly even switching out batteries didnt seem to helprange began at about 50'; now its about 25'"
5,Fantastic Product took a minute to install!!,I was having so much trouble making my X10 remote work on my rear yard outdoor lights. I saw these and they arrived yesterday. It took maybe a minute to hook it up and voila it worked perfectly. It is so nice not to have to keep recoding those darn X10 remotes. I bought two more to hook up to the front lights. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,Useless,"This product is garbage, the remote claims to have up to 150' range, it is more like 15 feet range. It makes no sense to use it because it doesn't provide any convenience on such a short range. By the way, I am using this product in remote area with no obstructions or other remote interference. Also, the remote control is not water proof."
3,Heavy Duty Remote,This product does not consistently provide the range that is stated. I bought 4 of these and some work better than others. Some only reach about 75 feet.
3,disappointed,"I bought two thinking that these would each have a separate frequency. Nope. Also, there's no dual frequencies, like to be able to select from two so that you don't interfere with the other. Also, something odd: one controller is more effective than the other, why is this? A big con for me is that there is a non-removable overshoot of the plastic housing, so that there's a surrounding amount of plastic over the plug which makes it impossible to connect any adapter type plugs directly into the device (I was hoping to turn a certain type of radio on and off using this device, but wouldn't have worked anyways since once the radio turns off it stays off till manually turned on, sigh). Also they gas off somewhat when not in use (meaning they are smelly). Smells like ozone, made me feel ill. Better than the worse WD40-like smell I sometimes smell on cheap made in china products. I'm thinking about giving one away as a present."
3,outside use,The remote buttons stick so either will not cut on or will not always cut off once t is on
1,HW2190 Heavy Duty Remote Control - Junk,"I was very happy with the product to start with. Nice range, easy to use. Then after about 2 weeks it no longer functioned, at all. it's useless. It was being used for my mom who is confined to the bed to signal us to when she needed help. Worked great for 2 weeks and now she has to yell her head off to get anyone's attention. I'm afraid to waste more money on other items like it now."
1,worst purchase ever,"Purchased based on reviews. I would say I must have gotten a bad one....BUT I ordered 3 and none had the range capacity of 20 feet. Went back to a cheaper remote with 80ft distance from Home Depot and they worked. What a disappointment for light display. I would send all back if I didn't tear up the packaging just trying to get one that worked. On top of all this, the item took over two weeks to get here, thereby preventing me from finding out earlier that they don't work. At least Amazon states they were refunding my shipping because they were at a lost to explain why it took so long to recieve. You would think 1 out of 3 would work. Bah Humbug!"
3,"Shorter range, but works","The range on this unit is really about 75ft in real world conditions. Unless you have clear line of sight with no electronic interference, there is no way this would ever work over 150ft. Other then that issue, it works perfect. We use it to run our outdoor lighting. We have a 600w converter and this unit works fine with it, no issues. The on/off buttons are nice on the remote and the remote looks nice in person. Would recommend for anyone who doesn't need the long range."
5,Another great purchase!!!,"This is another great purchase. This book is small, good paper quality, and it has illustrations. This book is great for any body who likes books to have illustrations. It is not like many other boring books that do not have pictures. This books is great for children, yound children, and for any age. I am 22 years old and i love it."
4,GREAT BOOK,this is a great book! the beginning is a little boring. the book also has very BIG words that you would have to look up. it is very interesting and it tells about how life was back then. if you like historical fiction then you'll love this book.
3,okay,"Daughter of Venice, overall, was a pretty good book. In the beginning it was so boring. I kept saying to myself, ""Who really cares?!"" I wanted to stop reading it, but I didn't have time, since I had to write a report on it. As I read on, the book got exciting. I finished the book with so many unanswered questions. Also, I think the author, Donna Jo Napoli, should add much more description to her writing, so you would feel like you were in Donata's position. Overall it was an okay book."
1,TERRIBLE Book!!!,"This book was SO stupid! Not worth reading at all! It makes hardly any sense and almost the whole time, I sat there saying, ""And I payed money for this book!?"" This is some thing that I would for sure not recomend to any one! A stupid, ridiculous book! I love all of Napoli's other books, but why she wrote or published this book is beyond me! I highly recomend that you DON'T read this book!!!"
2,An avid reader who is not too pleased...,"I'm afraid this was not that great of a novel. The writing lacks sensory images and it is not really unique. There is hardly a plot near the end, and the conclusion makes you numb. It is not a happy ending, but the author is FORCING you to believe it is. (i.e. the man she loves does not marry her, and she spends the rest of her life teaching Latin to children. She cannot get married or have kids, or get much of a life. Wow, how exciting!)I have read so many novels including Gone With the Wind, A Walk to Remember, Dragonwyck, Jane Eyre, To kill a mockingbird, etc. You cannot possibly compare this with the Great Ones."
4,A must- read book,"In this book, they show you the average teenage-rebel girl who thinks that her parents are very over protective. If someone had only told me this it is very probable that I wouldn't have bought this book. This is not the case, because the author gives the already exploded situation a must needed edge. The plot is placed in Venice in the year 1592, and Donata, 14, is one of 11 ""kids"" from the Mocenigo family, a very weathy family. In those times, the girls were very overprotected because of the fact that they may be married and were to be kept very ""virgin"". Donata, finding herself in the spot of the not-to-be-married daughter, thrives to enjoy her days in dangerous outings against the knowledge of her family.The book is a must read, not only because is rich of non-direct history, but is very funny and thrilling."
3,Daughter of Venice,"This story was about a girl in the late 1500's wanting to get out of her safe palazzo and see all of Venice. Donata, the main character, is the daugher of a wealthy, noble family. She is very outspoken and listens to every thing her brothers and father discusses. She wants to be educated and tutored like her brothers, but she cant becuase she's a girl. Unfortunately Donata is not allowed to explore the city she knows so much about. So she dresses up every morning as a boy and sees all of Venice. She even gets a job in the Ghetto that no one in a noble family would ever get. She meets an older Jewish man that she starts to fall in love with. Every day in the streets she learns more about Venice and what goes on around her. You can even see how she changes as a person throughout the story. I thought that this was an O.K. book. The beggining was really boring, but it starts to get a little intresting towards the middle. Its one of those books where you can imagine it as a movie."
2,Pictures on the website are misleading,"Just received this item in the mail today and already I am not happy. This product i had ordered for my wife. Based on the pics, she has a pair that came from another company looking just like this. It looks like on the rear side it is supposed to be a string which that is what she likes for comfort, the pair i got today is a strap attached to stings. I am not a woman but that looks very uncomfortable. All in all i am not impressed with this product."
2,"Buy , but dont buy.","I don't know if this just happened to me , but after i used the 5th one they simply stopped working."
5,A Classic for Pentecostal Pastors/Teachers,"Dr. Howard Ervin destroys the myth that Pentecostal theologians don't wrestle with the Scriptures but rely upon personal experience to define and defend the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Dr. Ervin relies upon his vast knowledge of the Greek New Testament and Pentecostal theology to biblically define and defend the Pentecostal teaching on the baptism in the Holy Spirit with the initial, physical evidence of speaking in tongues.Whether you are a seasoned Pentecostal pastor/teacher or a non-Pentecostal theological student, you will enjoy Dr. Ervin's work on Spirit Baptism."
3,Can use it in my laptop,"doesn`t have USB port, just for old joystick. Big and uncomfortable, but it works, It depends with wich program you are gonna use it."
3,noisy!!,"The swing works well, as other reviewers had noted. However, the motor is extremely noisy. Our son actually hated it at first, but now he seems to like it. You just can't use it if you are trying to catch a nap with it in the same room. It also eats up batteries. I would have thought a better motor with an AC adapter would be a better idea."
5,Great Swing,"This baby swing is great! My son loves to sit and swing, and often falls asleep. The speed controls are easy to locate. The speed can be quiety and quickly adjusted. This has been a life saver."
2,"Go for a portable swing, or brighter colors","We got the previous Graco version when our 2-1/2 year old was born - turned out to be a waste for us. I can count on one hand the number of times we used it - the mobile is not colorful or stimulating, and he got bored sitting in it (it made him cry whenever I put him in it). It is quite bulky, becomes a permanent piece of furniture wherever you put it; I recommend using a portable Take Along-type swing that you can put baby in, and go from room to room. For us, this was not a great investment."
1,"Too big, 5-point harness takes too long","Takes way too long to strap my crying baby into the 5-point harness. Just makes things worse.Then if the swing does manage to put him asleep, opening the swing results in a thud that always startles and wakes up the little guy.I'm disappointed.We found a different swing that is smaller and easier to use."
1,Worst Swing Ever,"I bought 2 of these for my twins. I am seriously disappointed in this swing. First of all, the tray is very awkward to snap into place and although it is made of what seems like the cheapest possible plastic it is next to impossible open. I need both hands to pry it open. My babies can't even see the mobile because of where it is positioned. The music selection is TERRIBLE. The nature sounds don't sound like nature sounds at all, not sure exactly what happened there, and the music selection is just as bad. It's just random classical music, no traditional lullabyes. Also, these swings go through batteries very quickly. I didn't realize they could not be plugged into a wall socket when I bought them."
1,don't purchase this light,"I recieved a broken light fixture, this should not happene, you should receive fixture that is whole/complete. I was very dissapointed. I do not recommend purchasing this fixture."
3,"Great bag, but BIG","I use this bag when my 6 month old goes somewhere overnight. It's just too big and cumbersome for everyday use. Great sections and compartments, but I would suggest getting something smaller for everyday."
2,"Lots of room, but little comfort","We use this backpack when we travel with our two-year-old son (we've had this backpack since he was a newborn). I simply do not care much for this bag. It is definitely very spacious--we've never run out of room, even when we packed for cross-country or overseas flights. There are plenty of pockets, which is great. But this bag is just so bulky and uncomfortable to carry. The fabric is really stiff and the straps are not well padded at all. I also hate the fact that is doesn't have an insulated bottle compartment (unlike Colorado tote, which we also have and like a lot better than the backpack). So this bag is practical, but simply not comfortable. I would be hesitant to recommend it."
1,not impressed by product,"I thought having this backpack would be great because of the size and the fact it was a backpack, but I soon found out it would not fit under my Graco Quatro stroller!! To top it off only after 5-6 uses the seams around the zipper came apart in 2 of the compartments, and I do not overstuff them. Luckily I recieved 3 other diaper bags, one of which was a smaller backpack by baby innovations-that was both more durable and fit under my stroller!"
3,BEWARE!!!!,"I love the functionality of this backpack, however after having it for 9 months, I encountered my first disappointment. As parents, we often assume a product made to help you with your child (ie carry his things) would be safe for a baby. My child choked on the plastic cap on the end of the bungee type holder. Luckily, he pushed it to the front of his mouth and I was able to sweep it out. Thank God!!!! I should have been more careful about where I set the backpack, but honestly felt that since it was a product made to help with a baby, that it would be safe for him to fiddle with. My husband immediately pulled out his pocket knife and we cut the ends off of it."
3,"Great for overnight trips, bad for everyday","I've had this bag for about a year and have only used it a couple of times. I asked for it for my baby shower because I liked the backpack idea. It is a wonderful backpack but it's huge. I used it for a weekend trip when my child was about 2 months old...you know the stage when you're still packing every onesie and outfit they own...and I still had room left over. I use it mainly for overnight trips. It works great for that.It's a really nice bag and might be better for someone who has multiple kids and has to carry a lot of things, but I've found it to be too large for everyday use."
4,It's a keeper,"We are living in Germany and are expecting our 2nd and have a 4 yr old. This is great for being able to carry a lot of things. It has many pockets and is very organizable. The straps are a little cheap for this nice of a back pack, and not padded very well. They should be wider, softer and more padded. I find it them a little odd for a small framed body, but I will get used to it. The back pack itself is also a little heavy, but it is sturdy. I don't think it will tear up anytime soon. I would buy it all over again still though. It could just use some improving."
2,Disappointed,"My husband and I loved this diaper bag when we were shopping for our registry because of it's unisex quality. But when the baby came, we realized it is just too bag for day to day life. Also, the plastic compartments within the zipper compartments aren't very smart....they are too small for most things and are at weird angles. Now I use this diaper bag as a suitcase for when we travel...it does hold a lot of clothing but becomes pretty heavy. I bought a shoulder bag for day to day use and it's much easier to drag everywhere but if you are looking for a diaper backpack, I would buy a smaller one."
3,"Nice bag, but too big for day-to-day","I've been using this diaper bag for the last six months since my daughter was born. It has some great advantages, including comfortable straps, a style that my husband will carry, lots of great pockets, and a nice, sturdy construction. It has been on several airplanes and many day trips and has functioned well in that capacity. Unfortunately, it is really too big for day-to-day usage, especially since it doesn't fit in the under-stroller compartment. I end up using the freebie bag from the hospital unless we are taking a whole-day (or longer) trip that requires tons of gear. I plan to buy a smaller backpack diaper bag soon."
2,undelivered shoes,hello francis toro you send an email because my super Birki clog shoes have not reached me buy them in December 2010 please inform me thanks
5,Great for doctors!,"Got this as a Christmas gift from my sister. My wife loved how they look as I put em on, an I've gotten countless compliments at work. Needless to say they live up to their comfort reputation. I used to wear crocs before... But for a professional like myself they offer a more sofisticated yet comfortable wear.Want another one in blue to replace my blue crocs specialist :)"
2,not made for walking,"bought these for long days in the hospital including hours standing in the OR. they're great for standing as they provide good arch support, but they're horrible for walking in - they cramped my toes and gave me blisters on the top of my toes"
3,Great shoe - wish the insole fit,"I love these shoes, but the insole was too small for me. Very uncomfortable so I bought the waterproof Birkenstock clogs with no insole. Amazon has a great exchange policy on shoes."
3,A few good nuggets,"I think the central theme is good. I learned a bit about the Tao, and I like the parallels the author draws between the Tao and good photography. By the end I found some of it repetitive, but overall I enjoyed his thesis and found it thought provoking."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent book, particularly the first half which discusses principles of taoism as applied to photography. Don't confuse this book with one of the same name by Tom Ang."
5,take you to the nex level,"Definitely not for the technical-oriented photographers. Either for more seasoned photog or amateurs who want to go beyond the obvious.I was already familiar with what this book is touching, however I had great pleasure to see that I was not only one.Beautiful. Insightful. Wise. Mind-opening.In my top 5 photo books!"
4,Photographers -book,"A most interesting and unusual volume. Nice to read a refreshingly different viewpoint on a very overworked subject. Well illustrated to reinforce the authors points. Doubt it would appeal to the P&S set ,but for a more serious art phtographer it provides some new ways to see photographs"
2,Vic Firth Gourmet Orange Mario Batali Peppermill,"I am disappointed with this product. The adjustment for the grind took several uses before I was able to get the fine/course adjustment to be what I wanted. Then, the adjustment kept changing with each additional use. I am constantly checking the adjustment before each use. I am a drummer and Vic Firth makes excellent drum sticks - I expected to get the perfect peppermill, but I did not get one. Perhaps Mr. Firth should stick to drum sticks and stay out of the kitchen."
4,Great but beware newbies!,"I got the download to this program and was so entirely confused that it was unreal. Now me being me, I didn't bother with the help menu and instead gave up. After playing around with the commands for a while and taking a few tutorials, I finally could use it.But after I got going, there was no stopping me. If you end up buying this item, use the help menu to your advantage. Maybe you're smarter than me and you'll catch on quicker. Either or. Beware graphical newbies!"
4,Lovely readings of the overlooked Brahms string quintets,"The Boston Chamber Players, consisting of first-desk personnel from the BSO, alwyas play with elegance and style. At times I'm not sure they dig in enough, but thise lovely readings of the two Brahms string quintets put their best foot forward. These are sunny, genial works, well suited to the gorgeous polished tone of the Boston players--it's like hearing the orchestra's elegant string section in miniature. Tempos tend to be on the fast side, and we're definitely on the surface more than beneath it. Even so, this CD stands out among the best versions of these two masterpieces."
5,Hankster,"I love this case. It's leather flap is held down by a good magnet system. It is sturdy, and I feel like my Nano is well protected. I have the Black one.The clip is very strong. Highly recommended."
5,Mink Mary and Me,"I first read Mink Mary and Me,in the early 50's when I was just starting high school and a head full of adventure and almost old enough to purchase my first hunting licence. I loved this book then, and was lucky enough to purchase a copy, off this site a few weeks ago. It is a rare and expensive book, but worth any money you spend on it. Chick Ferguson took his wife (one of the first white women that far north) to a cabin 100 miles north near Providence, north west of Great Slave Lake in the North West Territories.It is about their adventure and struggle with the natives, animals and elements of the north trying to eek out a living during the depression. It is full of adventure and excitement. If you can beg borrow or buy this book do so. You will not put it down. I have read a lot of the books on the north and this tops all but Alone in the wilderness by Bob Swerer. Enjoy"
5,ONE OF THE BEST ILLUSTRATION BOOKS OUT THERE,being a fashion illustration student I was very apprehensive about purchasing another fashion illustration book written by someone who thinks they know how to teach illustration but instead this book is a real treat!! it couvers not only women and men but children also which is very rare. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK if you're serious about illustration!!!
1,Deceptive Title in advertisment,I was decieved by the title of the ad. I thought I was ordering and paying for the fifth edition of Fashion Sketching but only recieved the Third Edition. I was told by seller that I should have read the describtion before I placed my order. I found the response to be belittling and distasteful. I believe that the describtion should support the topic otherwise its False Advertisment.
3,Out Dated,"In general, the book delivers what it sets out to do...teach the beginner a ""how to"" in illustrating fashion. Although, the croquis (models drawn) are quite out dated. Now-a- days, designers and students use 12 to 15 head croquis, Ms. Abling although talks about the idealized long figures but fails to demonstrate the current lengths. Besides this ""technical"" outdate I found a few (very few) other outdated parts to this book (i.e. color marker and flats section) But for the sake of not being too critical, I think this book is still worth buying!"
5,wonderful Book,"I've always enjoyed this Author/Artist, and getting this expanded edition was a real treat.I highly recommend it!"
2,Better options available,"Dean Shostak's album of classical music for glass harmonica is marred by pervasive amateurishness. Shostak's skill on the instrument is adequate, but the musicians who accompany him have serious problems with intonation. Sound quality is less pristine than one would hope or expect, and the CD's running time is a bit short for such a steep price. The DVD features several brief video pieces on the glass harmonica, most notably Shostak's appearance on one of the final episodes of ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."" You can do better."
3,interesting,"This is my least favorite armonica cd. my favorites are Yatri\Crystal Spirit 1996 and William Wilde Zeitler\Songs from Earth 2001. but don't go by me, i never liked classical music. i bought this for the dvd. i was very interested because i really had no idea what a glass armonica was. i am glad i watched it. they showed glass being blown, shaped, and assembled. and it was the first time i really watched mr rogers. on the other hand, i would have been just as happy watching this on the science channel. it seemed like something appropriate for that milieu."
1,Letdown,"I expected this to be a great listen, and unfortunately I was horribly disappointed. This is not worth your time or money, and if you like this type of music, there are better options at cheaper prices out there."
1,Really bad!,"Bad and amaturish renditions of some great music mostly due to the poor Armonica playing. I am a glass artist just learning about glass music. If this was the only recording I had gotten it would have been my last. However, I also got the Bruno Hoffmann CD ""Music for Glass Harmonica"" with much the same music on it. Very good. I will be much more ceareful what additional glass music I buy and will stay far away from Dean Shostak's work."
4,"With improving FW releases, this box is getting better","I've owned the netgear eva8000 for 8 months now. At first I was quite upset that it didn't perform all the tasks advertised on the box, especially the TV feature. However, now that I've been a beta firmware tester, I'm seeing that this box is getting much much better. The latest firmware versions are very stable and easy to navigate. The TV feature still doesn't work for me, but the engineers at Netgear are working on this issue.On the weekends, I just let the box randomly play music from my collection during a photo slideshow. It really brings all your media to the family room and makes it easy to enjoy. I am really happy with this product."
3,Not ready for Prime Time,"This product needs some software and firmware upgrades to make it a viable media center. Specifically the UI structure still seems to be in Beta mode. Setup was painless (altho if you are VISTA OS make sure you upgrade the firmware), Internet Radio worked well and playing AVI & WMV files worked well, it could not find my iTunes playlists either. But the biggest bust is the confused state of the UI which makes this product unusable (especially for VOB files). Tech Support was from abroad and was awful, they're not familiar with the product and the techy was shooting from the hip.Looks like i'm going back to my XBOX360 as my media center."
1,Don't waste your time,"I won't bother repeating what the other reviewers have said, except to summarize:1. This product could be great2. It isn't, because it is totally unstable and buggyI'm a software developer too and so I am comfortable enough with the odd peculiarity or minor bug. But this - even after firmware upgrades etc. - is so riddle with bugs it seems like functional swiss cheese.Don't bother - not even with a view to having netgear fix it in the future - they've been trying for more than 6 months and seem to be going completely the wrong direction on this one. A pity, because the eva8000 was well conceived and they have other good products I've used."
1,**Major** disappointment to this failry tech savvy user (IT professional),"Short version:I cannot express how excited I was to get this device, but after two and a half long weeks and well over 12 hours on the phone with some very polite (but ultimately inept) Indians, I had to acknowledge this experience for what it was: and exercise in futility.I hated having to send the unit back, but I really don't need another expensive piece of useless clutter in my place.Save yourself the frustration. It's *really* not worth it."
1,stay away from it,"This product is full of defects. Definitly not ready to ship to the market.After 4 days of operation it would not boot any more. Tech Support was not able to hard reset it.Other defects:If you apply the online firmware update then you cannot use 802.11G WPA encryption any more.It consistently does not find SMB file shares.Video playback suddenly stops during payback. They are no error messsages. It just jumps back into the main menu.The software is written very poorly. There are never error messages. If something fails it either resets or jumps back to the main menu. Belive me, you will see that a lot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,eva800,"The product did not work with windows vista ultimate. After many hours and constant escalation up the chain at netgear. The product would not recognize most of the folders that I was trying to share and gave different share results each time it scanned. In the end, Netgear was at a loss for what to do. I got the impression that the product was never vetted on Vista"
2,Didn't work and lousy tech support,I have a new PC with Vista and this thing kept crashing. I called tech support and got some guy in India that new nothing. Said he would call back and never did. Get an XBOX360 instead - it does all the same things and works smoothly.
1,Reconsider before purchase EVA8000,"I bought EVA8000 July 24th, 2007Make Long story short1 If you want to see video clip for 2006 or later version,do not buy this since most of video clip is unavailable to play2 When you purchase Netgear Product, never expect to get any technicalsupport form them. They would not answer whatever it is.I ask 5 questions since I bought but no answeruntil today Aug 13,2007.I had always respond saying' my name OOO will responsible your question...'from different person.It reminds me that old man said' Everybody's resposible is nobody's responsible'"
4,Powerful but get a tech to set it up,"In the end this product did what I wanted, but it is not for the faint hearted to set up. the geek squad from Best buy couldn't do it after several hours of attmepts, but finally, my daughter's computer whiz boyfriend figured it out. Nicely imports photos, videos, etc. from all networked pc's in the house via a wired network connection to the router. Also goes directly to you tube on the web and plays video content from there. Awesome!"
2,adequate,I was excited to get and try this product but was somewhat disappointed in trying to get it to do what i wanted to - so i just plugged the computer directly to the tv-hd-monitor - set the appearance settings and it was marvelous as is without the inbetween netgear box - save your money - plug in directly to your tv and it'll be better!
2,Very Buggy and Does Not Do What the Box says,Wait for an alternative. This unit is still under active development. Much of the functionality that it boasts does not work (for example TV Tuner cards are listed as supported on the box but Netgear openly says this does not work). The hardware is too weak to support HD and even on standard definition it frequently stutters and loses video/audio sync.
2,Crappy support,"Unit does not play avi format files from my Canon SD800is camera.Tech support is useless. Very polite technicians but they have no command of the English language and are unable to get results. Although you get to speak with a live person, you would get the same result talking to a pet shop parrot. No matter the outcome they will say, ""thank you for choosing Netgear"" even if you are complaining about everything.Overall the product is OK but fails to deliver as promised. For $300 what do you expect?"
2,"Tons of cool features, good luck getting them to work!","I read all the negative reviews, but foolishly and desperately (since there are so few alternatives) decided to give it a try. To make a long story short, after 3 days of trying, I still couldn't complete a full scan of my media (about 2000+) files without crashing the system in the process. Overall, it has been a very frustrating experience. Please do yourself a favor and stay away. If you must buy, make sure you get it in a place where you can return it easily.Pros:- Extensive list of supported format- Internet radio- HDTV supportCons:- Unstable, lost network connection and crashes all the time (I tried both beta and latest official firmware)- HD support over wifi is very flaky- YouTube didn't work (the latest version didn't help either)- Menu structure reminds me those DOS based applications in early 90s."
2,unreliable,"The machine has a lot of potential, with excellent format support and 1080 capability. The Youtube feature works well. I returned mine because it froze and required rebooting constantly, even while playing small MP3 files. Very frustrating."
2,Oh so clever clever,"A clever premise, some funny moments, but in the end so hollow and self-indulgent. It takes the post-modern vibe and runs too far... stick with David Eggers or David Foster Wallace. I'm sure Maddox can do better--he clearly has talent. But the self-conscious references and 'aren't I clever' showiness get annoying fast."
1,Overpraised hype,"Perhaps this is clearly a case of someone getting a huge advance because of their ins with the publishing community...or perhaps this is a case of 'love it or hate it.' Well, I'm on the latter end of that phrase. I found MY LITTLE BLUE DRESS self-concious, pretentious, and not funny at all. But worse: it's just plain old poorly written. MY coffee stayed firmly in mouth and did NOT upend itself through my nose. Great cover design, though."
1,Awful book,Probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I only purchased it because I had unfortunately spilled water on the library's copy and wanted to replace it.
1,Painful,"This book was so painful to read. I kept waiting for the real story to start and it never did...then the book ended and I had a little mini-party inside to celebrate that I was done. It was a waste of my time. I should have stopped reading it...I guess I had just hoped it would become interesting, but it never did."
4,Looking-glass world,"Maddox keeps story questions alive and humming even after you *think* you've figured out what's going on and why. For those who think this is a one-gag book, I must respectfully suggest that they see how Maddox leaves clues like breadcrumbs and doesn't let up with the mystery until the final few pages.And this book was funny as hell."
1,"Oh, but it is supposed to be bad... Really?","This is a bad book. Bad in the not at all good way. The fact that the book more or less rests on the oh-so-clever premise of ""this is a bad book on purpose"" in no way excuses the fact that, folks, this is a bad book. Hand me a burger and tell me it tastes bad, but on purpose (wink, wink) does not make the burger taste better. The premise could have possibly worked as a subplot, perhaps the activities of a character, but as the entire plot it failed miserably. Maybe it would have even worked as a short short story. In any case, expanded over what actually did seem like a million pages, it was torture. I don't know why I even finished it other than morbid curiosity that something, in fact, this bad could have been published. Aspiring authors: read this book- it will give you hope that even what you write in your sleep could be published. This was just a plainly bad book. Wink wink or not."
3,Bizarre (but in a good way),"Too terriby clever. Almost exhaustingly so. Yet, MLBD was a delightful read, laugh-out-loud funny and refreshingly different. Yes, the author is another one of those hip, smarty-pants gen-x types that you would probably want to punch if you met him at a cocktail party, but the whole concept of this psuedo-memoir combined with its quirky, amusing prose makes for an entertaining read."
2,Clever but what else?,Felt a bit weary after finishing this book. All very clever clever but it's one gag book. Fed up with over educated but under talented authors.
1,Good for undergraduate psychology class to review the author,"I forced myself to finish the book just so I could provide the review. The author started off with great potential. If this were a college essay the author would fail. Quoting the author, ""This book's a pile of (...), though, obviously."" page 292.His book's opening contents do not match the story. He fantasizes about a 13 year old girl orgasming and then moves his fantasy of her on to the same female but now a young heterosexual woman having her first homosexual experience, while fantasizing about this protagonist the author praises himself for caring for an imaginary grossly ugly old woman. An undergraduate psychology class might find the study of the book and this author of some use -- if they can get through his tangents to the end."
1,The worst book ever written,Ray Bradury was wrong when he wrote 'Fahrenheit 451' - There *is* a need for the firemen in the story
1,this book is not a satire - its a joke,there is no way this book deserves 3 stars. droll? clever? smart? don't be ridiculous. I agree with a prior poster who suggests that this might have made a decent short story - but its far too weak of a premise/joke to spread over an entire novel...it reminds me of the jokes that take 15-20 minutes to tell and don't have a funny punchline on purpose...the joke teller gets satisfaction from wasting the time of his audience...maddox certainly wasted my time with this book...the only reason i bothered finishing it was because i friend of mine recommended it to me...
1,Nonsense,"This is certainly the most trivial piece of nonsense I have yet to waste my time reading. From the beginning of the novel, the author leads the reader in so many directions as to make none of them compelling or tangible. The characters and imagery create apathy while the storyline is indistinguishable. The reader, hoping for a sensitive resolution is left with agitation at an unresolved, vacant conclusion. Altogether, this ""novel/memoir"" left me resigned to the overwhelming sense that the editor was on vacation while this book was published."
2,"attractive, but not functional","This drying rack looks spacious and functional. However, when you put bottles on the holders, they fall down and into the sink because the ""prongs"" are not tall enough to support them. I do like how the nipple/pacifier holder hangs over the sink edge, but I feel that this is the only redeeming quality of this product. Also, the ""open space"" area of this rack is slanted and doesn't offer any support against gravity, so the items stored there also fall into the sink or the nipple/pacifier storage area."
4,Love this product just doesnt hold enough bottles,I really like this drying rack and organizer. It does take up a lot of space as other people have said but it is a nice drying rack and organizer. It drains all the water out of the bottles well and is a nice place to store them until I am ready to use them again. This is a nice gift or item to get if you are expecting a child. I am glad I received this at my shower.
5,I recommend it.,If you need to find a lot exercises to practice your German Grammar and all. This is a excellent work book. You will find exercises after exercises to help you master your German Grammar and Vocabulary.You get a better use out of this work book when you used with the CD -audio Book- (not a must but I strongly recommend it).Deutsch: Na klar! (Student Edition + Listening Comprehension Audio CD) Student Package
3,"Does what it should, follows the lead of a poor textbook","This is just another workbook. I can't recommend or not recommend it but I can say the text it goes to is very poorly written and this workbook follows suit very well. The text tries too hard to be interesting while confusing new language students with its elaborate conversational sentencing. This workbook follows the book well but incorporates some of the same confusing dialogue. As a student, you have no real say here, so I'm sorry for you. As an instructor: Please choose a different text if you can!"
3,Interesting overview of American biker history,"Paul Garson, along with the help of the editors of Easyriders magazine, have put together a fairly comprehensive history of the biker culture here in the good ol' USA. Filled with lots of black & white photos, vintage ads & semi-distracting sidebars, this book is entertaining & packed full of factoids."
5,"Great album, beginning to end","This music might not be for everyone. But for those who like music with a dreamlike quality, this is for you. It never feels overproduced. Her voice blends perfectly with the music, neither one outdoing the other. My favorites, that haven't grown tiresome after many listens are ""Crush,"" ""Quicksand,"" ""Rest Easy,"" ""Red,"" and ""Not the End,"" although I rarely skip any of the tracks. While it's the kind of music where I often tend to zone out the words and just listen to the music, there actually is some great lyrics on here. That's not usually something I expect from ambient/electronic music - usually it's about the mood, and the words don't matter. So I give her even more credit for focusing on lyrics when she didn't need to."
5,She is an urban angel,"I found her music on DavesLounge, and fell in love with her sound. Her voice draws you in and holds you until the end. The music is haunting and masterful. I look forward to a lot more music from this very talented artist."
4,Great solo debut,"Nice eclectic mix of genres that's great for night driving. One thing that kinda bugs me is that there are two different versions of the cover song ""Colorblind"". After buying the CD and listening to it, the album version is different from another copy of the song that I downloaded. Can't figure out where this other version came from (I don't see it listed on any EP's or anything). Both versions are good, the album version sounds a bit more elextronica/trip hop, and the other versions sounds more acoustic.Anyway, if you enjoy singers like Emiliana Torrini, Niccola Hitchcock, or Norah Jones, you'll probably like Natalie Walker's Urban Angel."
5,Learn wound care,"This is a comprehensive how-to book. The illustrations are clear and precise and are fully explained. This is a useful book for all medical students and all those who involved with surgical incisions, acute lacerations, and other cutaneous wounds."
4,Useful for the sleep-deprived mother in the first months of breastfeeding,"I am a second time mother and remembered having trouble remembering the side I last fed on and for how long when in hospital and at home for the first few weeks when everything about breastfeeding is so new. After a couple of months, you don't really need anything like this, but when you are first starting out and are so tired from the delivery and bewildered about having a little person depending on you, this little bracelet helps.I didn't give it 5 stars because the little white markers are very fiddly and often pop off somewhere while you are trying to take on or off- good idea though as the nurses are constantly asking how long you fed and when was the last feeding. So, if you can work out how to use these markers it makes you seem very together when you can answer matter-of-factly in answer to their questions."
3,Nursing Reminders,These bracelets are so great in helping me remember when I last fed my now 2 month old- I wish I had them right when he was born because I was trying to remember feedings with crazy scribbles on notepads next to my bed. I've had lots of complements on them and I LOVE the colors- i bought a yellow and purple one. My only complaint is that the white bracket does fall off after awhile- they should sell more then 2 per bracelet or allow you to buy extra. AFter a month of wearing my yellow one I had to use the white brackets from my purple one... so now I will have to use those brackets for both:(All in all- GREAT! I will be buying these for upcoming baby showers
4,Fantastic look into Edwards' marriage,"This is a helpful book for all those who admire Jonathan Edwards. While Dodds is not totally accurate in her assesment of Jonathan and Sarah, this is a great book. This book will help you see that Jonathan was not just a pastor and theologian. He was also a husband and father. Endorsements include the Pipers, Mark Dever, Lig Duncan, Donald Whitney, and others."
4,Marriage to ANY man is difficult,"Marriage to ANY man is difficult.If marriage to Jonathan Edwards was difficult, are we all doomed to difficult marriages?! Jonathan Edwards was a respected Christian, and he and his wife Sarah raised a brood of great kids. Jonathan Edwards is regarded as one of the best Christian theologians ever in America. He was a decent, hard-working man and a caring husband. Yet being married to him was difficult. This is a great book for all of us who are in difficult marriages (all of us). If it's not difficult--it's not worth striving for and having. Do you agree? Give this book to anyone who is thinking of bailing out of a marriage because the marriage is difficult."
2,Dissatisfied Reader,This book came with such glowing reviews that I just knew if would be a great addition to my library. I have read the book one time and the binding is falling apart and pages falling out.This book is very poorly written and the author jumps from topic to topic with no transition.I would not recommend this book.
3,disapointed,"Based on the others two volumes in this serie, I expected a more complete volume, showing perhaps various sport-like costumes and how to draw it, even though it was calling Sex Sport Wear; after all, the other two volumes go beyond the mere ""sex"" aspect of costumes.So, if you want a lot of short shorts and bikinis, it is ok. If you want a more complete guide to draw sports wear, forget it"
2,quanity,I have not purchased this item but I think that it sounds great. How many discs do you get for the price?
2,Not fond of this,I didn't really like the flavor of this green tea. I found it bitter and will probably not order it again or add some flavoring.
3,Nice cup of tea.,"This is a nice cup of tea, but a little on the mild side. Also keep in mind that it cost a lot more than a tea bag. So we are only giving this one three stars. (Keep in mind that all of the Tassimo Disc on an average of $.55 to $2.50 each)"
3,Too expensive,"Very good tea, but outrageously expensive. Don't understand why. I have 2 Tassimos and now that Starbucks is gone, I am disillusioned at the meager assortment and price range of the T-discs."
3,Gevalia 1549 8 T-Discs Twining Green Tea for Tassimo Brewing System,"Not the best flavor, but I love how easy it is to make."
5,"excellent resource, lovely photos, neat descriptions","This book provides a comprehensive series of illustrations that immerse you in the world of fashion from this era. It is authentic and beautifully laid out, and depicts numerous costume items from the early 20th century, though mostly focusing on women. The pictures depict everything from dresses to shoes, hats to gloves; the women's hairstyles, makeup, undergarments, and overall looks give the reader the most authentic possible view of fashion and the aesthetic ideals of the time. The catalogue also shows the prices and features descriptions that include fabric and color. There are some pictures of men's and children's fashions. This book is thorough and unbelievably beautiful. The whole series of Sears catalogue fashions by decade is amazing. I recommend them all!"
5,Great Browsing!,"I am totally hooked on this series and hope Dover continues it for 1899-1909 and the '50s and '60s, as well. Note in this volume that the brilliant folk at J. Peterman have copied some of the c1913 skirts in their mail order catalog (I now own two, and they're gorgeous). Thank you, Dover, and thank you, J. Peterman!"
3,Everday Fashions of twneties. thirties and forties,As a Trade researcher they are excellent beginning tools for finding the era of a specific product I am researching at any one time. Once i get the feel for dating a specific product it enables me to move on to more specialised reference material. The prices are so good every design school or major brand should carry the series. Each season i always seek out new material for my library. Phillip Nutt
4,Excellent book on the process of effecting community change,"This book points out the necessary steps to building community -- or rebuilding one. Covers the essential processes to take, which entail building relationships of trust and laying groundwork for these relationships. Excellent books which relates to successful relationships in any endeavor in life.Also relates back most processes to the community, so members themselves are doing, not being done for. Quick read."
5,Beautiful And Timely Piece of Literature,"This book should be selling like hotcakes because of this impeachment Iraq fiasco. I was in Los Angeles during this fiasco, and Mr. Adams book was my only source of comfort. A great book with great truth and honesty."
4,"Canyon, don't look now, but it's huge!","The most spazmoniun work by Canyon since ""The Pelican Man"" series, where Canyon answered the question, ""How high is Daytona?""We need to keep an eye out for new works from Mr. Adams because he has finally met the promise of his early efforts, such as, ""The Obvious Looking Attendant.""Here, with ""Addiction"", he has touched on a subject close to his heart. He speaks a clear and concise message. His words go together like cookies and Sprite.Read ""Addiction"" and weep, only $12.95."
5,"Superb, Adams is the most powerful new author today","A must read for every American, regardless of political affiliation. The most truthful straight to the point book on the Clinton scandal written today! Informaitve and chilling as to the goings on and cover ups in the Oval office."
1,Where's the beef!?,"This book is pretty weak. I agree that our president is an immoral man, but this book doesn't contain any meat! ADDICTION IN THE WHITE HOUSE consistently states well-known facts, or it draws conclusions which are not really made clear and don't always seem to make sense. I'd never heard of Canyon Adams before, and his book was a poor choice of purchase on my part."
1,Disappointing.,"The title held such potential to create a depth of understanding to a subject that wreaks havoc in so many lives, but instead is a superficial commentary and focus on facts. The book seems more like a ""counter spin,"" albeit using ""arranged"" facts, to Clinton's spin masters. Nothing is wrong with facts -- this book just does NOT explore the facts, as they pertain to addiction, with much depth or insight. The complete dynamics of addiction, and the active addictive behavior of a world leader, actually should be of interest to every American concerned about the saftey of the nation -- and this book misses the boat."
5,I Was Impressed!,"I was very impressed by the honesty of this book. Canyon takes no prisoners. And how very true his words ring as we continue to watch our president disgrace himself, his family and his country."
5,Beautiful Berlioz,"This is a perfect recording of this beautiful opera. Susan Graham is the ideal Beatrice: funny, warm, and impestuous. The highlights of this recording are, without a doubt, the duet of Hero and Ursula at the end of Act I, and the trio of Beatrice, Hero nad Ursula near the beginning of Act II. These are Berlioz at his most lyrical and beautifully sung."
5,Near to Mozart,"A fantastic recording that I got due to a friend recomendation.It has several facets of Mozart, but handled in a french and particular way. This is Berlioz at his best and the singing of Graham is perfect. The recording is, as with Erato, clear and focused. The french diction is excellent, since they are several dialogues Highly recommended"
5,Lots of adventure!,Reading each night's story is a highlight for our family during advent. Every night ends with a cliff hanger that makes us anticipate the next night. Great adventure story to keep boys attention too.
4,Nice family time story during advent,"I read this book to three of my children ages 5, 8, and 12. They all liked it and looked forward to reading it each night, often begging for more. I did not read the devotional at the end of each chapter, but let the story speak for itself. I did think that the character Nathan, a Jew awaiting the Messiah, seemed more like a modern day evangelical. But the story was interesting and gave my children a good idea what life was like during the time of Christ and how the Jews longed for the Messiah to come. It also showed God's merciful love, in taking harsh circumstances and working good out of them. Reading this book each night during advent was well worth it."
2,Big Let-down after Jotham's Journey,"Jotham's Journey kept us riveted as a family. We loved reading that each night! We were excited to start the sequel the following year. We were so disappointed to discover that it is basically a re-hashing of Jotham's story from a different viewpoint. Really, there is very little new here. The main plot is still Jotham's story, which we already knew. What a let-down. We loved, loved, loved Jotham's Journey, but this book was a huge disappointment. I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews."
2,Not much fun,"I got this for my then 9 year old son. I though he would enjoy it. It's not really that much fun. And it is not very sturdy, it is made out of very thin pieces of paper that tear easily."
2,Apple iPod Shuffle Dock - Works but Overpriced,"This replacement dock is slightly better and cheaper than the one provided by Apple for the Shuffle. However, it is still overpriced. This product does work, but there are alternatives ranging from 40 cents to $5 that will do the same job.This fills a product need created by Apple. If this was made better the Docks wouldn't break so easily. Normal USB adapters should have been included with the product instead of the mini-doc, or at least backup cables. A standard USB port connection could also have been used.Check out the alternatives which are much more reasonably priced.USB adapter for the 2 Gen Apple iPod ShuffleAPPLE Ipod Premium White USB Data / Charging Adapter Adaptor for Apple 2nd Generation ShuffleIncipioBud USB adapter for the 2 Gen Apple iPod ShuffleHaving a backup dock or adapter is a must for your iPod shuffle. It just doesn't make sense to buy the expensive replacements.Good luck!"
3,Over-priced & easily broken,"Purchased from an Apple store, which was my first mistake. Nevertheless, though Marware Travel Dock charged my 2nd gen ipod shuffle fine for a while, it easily broke while I carried it in my backpack. I can imagine the same scenario if either inserted a bit carelessly into the USB port or having something bump into it while inserted. The insertion ""prong"" was damaged and became loose, rendering it useless. My computer failed to recognize the ipod. Therefore, even at relatively inexpensive $15, it's still over-priced ($30+tax for the priviledge of buying it from the Apple store). There are somewhat comparable and smaller models for less than $3 from Amazon - and that includes shipping."
5,I love this dock!,Apple should consider using this design for the dock included with the Shuffle. It is great for use with a labtop
4,Marware USB Travel Dock for iPod Shuffle,This product that we use to charge our iPod Shuffle has worked very well and we have had no problems with it. We plug it into our laptop and are careful to store it safely when not in use.
3,It is a good idea...,"So this dock is far superior to the supplied Apple dock in that it is less unwieldy. However, it is really loose, if you even bump it, it unmounts the shuffle. A bit more time on the design would have served it really well."
4,A compact replacement solution,"This works well with my MacBook Pro, compact, travels well. Looks and feels like a product made by apple, sturdy plastic and light gray rubber bottom, like the Apple dock. Though if there is nothing wrong with the dock that came with your Shuffle, this doesn't offer any real advantage over the dock supplied by Apple except to eliminate a cable. Feels just a tad loose when plugged in but doesn't affect how it works. This is a good alternative if you've lost or broken your dock or need a replacement otherwise."
3,Interesting but disappointing,"I looked forward to reading this book very much and perhaps that is why I'm disappointed with it. It starts off well but somewhere along the line is sidetracked. I can't tell if its poor editing or if a significant part of the text is pulled from the interview text with Galland after the war (the English usage is poor; too poor for a someone who's first language is English). Despite other reviews to the contrary, I didn't find the ""analysis"" to be hardhitting. I found it redundant. It seemed like the only ""analysis"" was that of Galland, a supporter of the fighter service, which states over and over that the fighter service was mishandled. It's almost a sour grapes refrain. The very end of the book seems to try to make a case of how effective the Luftwaffe fighter arm was by quoting lots of statistics that don't seem to add up. Editing again or poor research? It reads quickly so give it a go if the subject is a favorite but don't expect anything from the ""analysis"" side."
1,Scarred for life!,I read this book when I was 5 years old and it absoultley terrifed me. I did not get over my fear of underneath my bed until I was about 12 years old and I am now 25. Just an FYI if your child is sensitive this may not be a good book from them.
5,Great Book,"This book was great! My son, who is 3 absolutely loved it! It wasn't too scary for him and counting the number of monsters up to 5 was a fun way to learn how to count. I recommend this book to any child who loves monsters."
1,Threw it Away!,"I bought this book to help my 5 yr. old get over his night time fears. This book added to his anxiety. The story starts out fine, brothers teasing each other...but, on the last page it shows the 2 boys in bed with a pair of eyes under the bed!!! What is this, Stephen King?!"
2,wheels get stuck,If you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you. But just try turning and especially sharp turns--you'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way.
4,Good quality for a used book,"Got this as a gift for a kid who adores Calvin and Hobbes comics, and he was very excited to receive it. The book is in good condition."
4,Finally got it right,"Ok, so after two kids I finally got it right! This bag is wonderful. After reading the other reviews, I bought this bag, and I am so glad I did. The zipper compartment on the bottom is perfect for holding wipes and even a couple diapers. The velcro compartments fit all my stuff, while the large compartment fits babies needs and even has pockets for bottles, lotions and even my cell phone. Only complaint, it needs to be in black."
4,List of songs,Ready and WillingTalk It OutDream OnDon't Wanna See You DownChance of a LifetimeLove StaysNo Time for LoveIf OnlyGotta Keep Dancin'
2,Does not last.,"Works just the way I want it to with a spray and solid switch, and the ability to point the stream where you wish. The problem is that the product just wears out far too fast."
5,Loving my faucet sprayer!,"When I moved into my house, there was no kitchen faucet sprayer so I bought a new 'chrome' plastic faucet sprayer but have hated it! It sprays so forcefully, and our water is so hard, that I have to constantly wipe the hard-water spots off of my sink and my chrome faucet. I miss my old-fashioned rubber sprayer and could only find the push-on type, not the screw-on one. I'm so happy now!!! This is perfect! Thank you!"
1,Very confusing description,"The technical description given is:""THERMOS HJC751 Navman USA GPS For IPAQ""I can only assume I can hook this thermos bottle to my Ipaq GPS and then I will have a map for the entire united states.Or does the map show up on the side of the thermos?Or do I look in the mouth like a kaleidoscope to see the map?Oh, the possibilities are endless when you get into this sort of technology!Or is it just another thermos like others are selling for $23?"
1,Instant Architect,I have this program and it was not at all what I expected. It's difficult to use. I still haven't figured out to use it even with a printed manual. I mostly wanted a program that I could easily design a spiral staircase with and that would print out a material list for me. I should have saved my money. I think you would have to be an architect for this to be instant.
5,For a old log splitter,I ordered this for a old log splitter. Icould not find it locally. It arrived on time and it fit perfect. I will orde another one when I need it.
3,Information from a U.S. Marine,"After reading in the introduction that the recruits marched from the ""H"" shaped wooden barracks at MCRD, Parris Island, I started to wonder at the depth of the investigative reporting that the author provided.The wooden ""H"" barracks were located at ""Mainside"" where the bulk of the boot camp training was performed.When I went through recruit training at Parris Island early in 1959, there was a wooden sign hanging from the top of the Quonset hut where I stayed while in training at the rifle range. It simply stated that ""From this hut 6 Marines marched to their death, April 8, 1956."" I will cautiously continue reading the book.Semper Fidelis."
3,Too many excuses on behalf of the drill instructor,"If you agree with the author's opinions, then you also must agree that the entire Army was responsible for My Lai and the entire Navy was responsble for Tailhook. Ridiculous. If you cannot entrust a mission to a subordiante in the military, then why have subordinates? Why use drill instructors in Marine boot camp? Why not just send all the recruits into a class room and let officers do it? Why not? Because Sergeants and above are supposed to be able to handle the responsibility of training recruits while following the rules. Who can forsee that a staff sergeant is going to go off half-cocked and march 7 recruits to their deaths? Who can forsee that an officer will take part in the murders of over 100 innocent civilians? The fact is, regardless of what other drill instructors had done prior to Ribbon Creek, none of them hastened the deaths of 7 recruits. The drill instructor in this book did and he got what was coming to him."
4,Why Ribbon Creek?,"An extremely informative & detailed read! Stevens iterates a tragic event in Marine Corps history with a direct, thought provoking style. As the current Commanding Officer of the Recruit Training Regiment at Parris Island, I am encouraging my officers & drill instructors to read this book in order to better understand how close we, the Marine Corps, as an organization, came to being disestablished because of the actions of just one man. Another book of interest on the same subject matter is Keith Fleming's, ""The U.S. Marine Corps in Crisis: Ribbon Creek & Recruit Training."" Another important book in helping to understand how the recruit training process has evolved."
2,Pretty good book but not for serious fisherman,"The book gives general decriptions on the fishing fairy well, but it does not provide enough informations about the fishing technics. Also this book needs to be updated and could use a little better organization."
2,At least it's cheap,"If you want concise information and reference for full range salwater fishing, this book is not for you. It is wordy; more like a compedium of fishing stories. It only covers some of the major species. There are some pages covering basic rigs and lures. The book is a bit outdated. This is a good beginner's book if you are considering getting into saltwater fishing, and want to get a feel for the sport more than detailed, specific information. I have had mine for many years, and refer to it when I am thinking of going after a new fish. If if sounds interesting, I look for more info elsewhere."
4,Egyptian Gothic,"One of the most interesting books I've read in a while, it's a combination of the Gothic story and Ancient Egyptian setting. Interesting characters, settings, and details about Egyptian life...plus one creepy plot that slowly develops until a big ending."
1,Whoops,It must have been late when I ordered this for my wife. I don't know what I was thinking. It's overpriced about 80 times at $20. You could find a similar necklace in a gumball machine for a quarter.
4,Nice costume jewelry piece,"Cute. Yeah, a little cheap construction, and the crystals look a little cheap, but it's not an expensive necklace so you're not going to get anything fancy here. I just like this style of jewelry and my hubby never knows what to get me, so I put this on my wish list as a guideline for him. The clasp and the links look and feel sturdy, so it's good costume jewelry."
2,"Fun, but fragile",I received this game on Wednsday. My 2 sons played it for 2 days. Friday night it broke. You were no longer able to reel in the fish. Returned it to toy's R Us on Saturday. Too bad. Seemed like a fun game.
3,"Good bag, but not durable enough","I loved this bag for the first 5 months of my son's life. After that the zipper came apart, the pockets came unstitched and it fell apart. Its a good bag if you're looking to pack a moderate amount of things: diapers, wipes and pad, pj's, maybe a bottle or two. Anything more than that strains the zipper and mine came unstitched from the bag."
3,Too stiff and smaller than it looks,I played with this bag in the store after seeing it online and I was disappointed. The shoulder strap is stiff and short--its fine hanging from your shoulder but you couldn't wear it across your chest. It also wasn't as roomy as I would have liked--I was looking for something to hold more than the hospital's freebie diaper bags. I'm also not a fan of how bulky and padded diaper bags in general are--as if babies diapers and toys are made out of glass--please! I ended up buying a normal shoulder/tote type bag and have been very happy with it.
4,first impressions,"My first response was that it did not look like a ""diaper bag"". I mean really who wants to carry around a pooh bag! Lets face it our diaper bags become our purses.So, we need diaper bags/purses that don't look like them, we need a mom purse! a purse that can be used for both. Anyway I just thought this would be more ""universal"" and nice looking all in one.So I give it 4 stars!"
5,the perfect bag,"I love the fact that i can hang it on the handles to my stroller with the front pouches facing me. I put my wallet and money if top big zipper and make-up in the other. side pocket holds my bottle of sanitizer. so that i dont have to dig in the bag for it when i desperatly need it. mesh side pouch is used for water bottle or used baby bottle. But the inside WOW. i carry four 8oz bottles and 1 recieving blanket. two burp cloths four servings of formula. wipe case 4 diapers. three toys. Now the inside zipper. I carry extra onesie, extra pants, tylenol, Q-tips, desitin, orajel, thermometer and socks. It's the best bag to go to amusement parks, mall and anything u can think of.i would not trade it for the world."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the look and sturdiness of this bag. It was great for the first 2 months when you hardly need anything but I can hardly fit any clothes , toys or bottles. I am using it only to bring toys to and from. I purchased a bag that is deeper and more square so I can pile items in. I just didn't find it economical.Nazareth, Pennsylvania"
4,Awesome Bag!!,"This bag is an awesome tote/purse, you can carry everything in it from your wallet to the bottles.It is awesome!"
1,Terrible for bottles,"This bag was great until our son started daycare. Now I have to pack a separate cooler for his bottles, plus the diaper bag, plus my pumping bag, plus a purse, not to mention carrying him.If you have no need for carrying more than one bottle, this bag is okay.A second point is that the adjustable strap is not that adjustable. My husband looks like he's wearing this bag like a necklace no matter how long the strap is."
2,It was TOO BIG for my liking!,"I purchased this ""thinking"" it was smaller than it actually was. I thought the color was perfect for a daddy to carry around but when my husband looked at it...he was NOT impressed with the looks of it AT ALL! Needless to say, this will be going to the thrift store."
3,Watch out for that shoulder buckle!!!!!!,"Cons:1. For a bag that is a BIG as this is, it doesn't hold much. My eddie bauer midi tote holds the same amount.2. I used the shoulder buckle to release the bag while I had my daughter on my hip. The weight of the bag, caused the buckle to SNAP my baby across the face, leaving a huge red welt. I cried with her--it was AWFUL.Pros:1. Comfortable to wear!2. Great look and color--my husband will carry it too."
3,Too Big,"When I saw this bag, I was really excited. It looked like everything I wanted. I was looking to downsize my diaper bag. I read the reviews others wrote and still thought it would be perfect. Well, I got it in the mail and it was huge- way bigger than I had expected. It was the same size as the diaper bag I have been using. I was really disappointed. It is a great bag (I actually gave it to a friend who is expecting her second and needed something bigger), but just too big. So, anyone looking for something smaller- this is not the one for you."
2,Not as big as it seems,"The bag was very nice and well made, however, the inside is much smaller than I was expecting. I do pack a lot of things, I hate not being prepared. Once I put 4 size 3 diapers in the inside pocket, you could barely get to the main section of the inside. There was no way to put a recieving blanket, onesie, sleeper, diapers, bottle, and formula in there. I plan on returning it."
5,ROOMY AND GREAT LOOKING,"This was the best pourchase I made after having my daughter almost a year ago. I had gotten a bag to match my stroller/carseat and it started falling apart after three months! I have had this bag for about 6 months now and it doesn't look a day old! Here is what I am able to fit in mine and still have room for toys:diapers, wipes, formula dispencer, bottles, water bottle, one outfit, one undershirt, one sleeper, one blanket, two pairs of socks, two burp cloths, two bibs, tylenol, gas drops, saline drops, orajel, baby powder, cream, lotion, nose seringe, nail clippers, my wallet and my purse essentials!"
3,Great for if you have one baby,"I used this bag for the better part of the first year of my now 2-year old son. It was small and compact (I don't like giant bags because I can never find things in a hurry and everything is rushed when your child is crying or whining), my husband liked that it wasn't a ""girly bag"", it fit our baby necessities for short trips and was very durable. Durability is most important to me. I know myself; I throw bags around, I'm liable to spill my drink on it, I over pack. My one complaint is that I could not attach it to his umbrella stroller without it tipping over. But, overall, this bag did all for me... That is until my son started growing and demanding snacks and wearing larger clothes and needing toys to entertain him while we were waiting in line. We soon graduated to another canvas bag - a Skip Hop to be exact and in an exciting red, stylish color.Skip Hop Duo - Canvas-Charcoal"
3,great bag but,The bag is very durable and easy to carry but not enough room on the inside for what we need to put in it... i love this bag just wish it had more room for my little cooler for breast milk.
5,Best Diaper Bag Ever!,"I've had this diaper bag for about two years now and have absolutely loved it!!! It is the perfect size to carry around day to day. I love the outer pocket for ""mommy's stuff"" like wallet, pen, lipgloss, and keys. The inside compartment is extremely orginized which I love! It has a zipper pocket and six mesh compartments. It comes with a changing pad. It also has a large outer velcro pocket. It comes with a vinyl zipper bag for ""wet"" stuff. It is sooooo comfortable to carry and I love the way the zipper zips and unzips. You can do it with just one hand. Plus, I love the color and my husband isn't embarassed at all to carry it around. It has an insulated cup holder on one side and a mesh holder on the other. Overall, it's the best diaper bag I've ever owned and I have 4 children and am expecting my fifth. It is extremely durable! I've also washed it in the washing machine and air dried it and it still looks brand new after using it almost every day for two years!"
5,Great Bag!,I love this bag! There is plenty of room in it to fit all my little one's stuff (and I like to overpack).I really like the plastic pouch inside. It has come in handy several times when she has had accidents and we need somewhere to put wet clothes.At first I wondered why the strap had velcro on it. I was excited to discover that you can unclip and unvelcro it and attach it to the handle of your stroller! This is my favorite thing about the bag! It is very comfortable to carry too. I am so glad I picked it because it is great!
5,We love it!,"After 5 months it has held up very well, and there is room for everything. It's also masculine enough for my DH to carry."
3,Not the best,"I purchased this diaper bag as a ""step-up"" from my original. I was using the mini Eddie Bauer one and since my son has gotten older I need to carry more stuff around with me at all times, so I decided to go with a larger size. I really liked the look of this one and the front pocket for all of my personal belongings, and it was really lightweight. However, I could actually fit more into my small diaper bag than this one. I wouldn't recommend this bag based on how much stuff it fits."
4,Nearly Perfect,"After much shopping around I decided on this bag when my fifth child was born. I love it. It has plenty of room for all my baby stuff as well as books, toys and change of clothes for my toddler. The ""Mommy stuff"" pocket on the front is perfectly sized, I can fit my wallet, camera and phone in there without any trouble.My only concern with this bag is the mesh pockets on the interior. I've had problems with things catching the mesh when I was trying to remove items. So far it hasn't torn, but it is frustrating.Overall, I really enjoy this bag, and so do my kids."
4,Doc Martin,I got hooked from the first episode...Doc Martin is infuriating and very funny at the same time! Look forward to each episode.
4,following series on PBS,catching up on episodes I have missed. Always enjoy BBC productions. This one won't disappoint if you enjoy British humor. Also you become fond of the villagers and their daily problems. Also a medical complication which is always well done.
1,"Doc Martin, cannot use in USA","Be careful when ordering. The Doc Martin season II was not formated for USA...only viewable in Great Britian and Ireland. I am out the price of my purchase. The vendor I purchased it from said I could return and receive credit on my Paypal account with a 20% restocking charge and I pay postage. I do not have a Paypal account. Also, what frustrated me was they sold it to me knowing it would not work in USA.Yes, there was a disclaimer and I did not read it."
3,quality lacking,"My three stars have nothing to do with the content of the dvd which is great, but ........when the product I ordered on 5/7/10 had not arrived by 5/28/10, I contacted Amazon, and they concluded that the item had been lost in shipping and sent me a replacement dvd which arrived promptly, BUT there was a fair amount of 'skipping' on the second disc. Two days later, the original order (placed on 5/7) arrived. It is still in its wrapper, and eventually I will view it to see if it is in good shape, or if it skips too.So.... the Doc Martin series gets 5 stars; the very late delivery of the 5/7/10 product gets zero stars; and the prompt replacement of the 'lost in shipping' dvd gets five stars; but the quality of the replacement dvd gets 3 stars."
4,great series,I loved this series. It is very compelling to try to understand what makes Doc Martin tic. No one could play this character better then Martin Clunes. He makes it but the supporting characters are wonderful. American tv should take a lesson.
5,Spectacular!,"I just recently started watching Doc Martin and I bought the first season and I'm already hooked, I try to catch it everytime it comes on PBS and I hope to acquire the other seasons as well. This show is superb, and Martin Clunes is brilliant."
5,Fantastic!,"Great story lines, great acting, very substantive, very refreshing compared to US tv which in my opinion is really shallow and riddled with too much sex and violence. Would really like to get my hands on series 2 and 3. Not sure why this did not go on to a series 4."
4,"Likable characters, lovely scenery",The supporting characters are wonderful and well acted; overall I found this to be a very well done series. There was one episode where I found the drama a little heavy handed - otherwise very well balanced.
3,"Meh, it's funny at times","So Doctor Martin Ellingham was a heart surgeon who developed a blood phobia, and now he works as a GP. It's a funny show at times; the best characters are Auntie Joan (played by a brilliant Stephanie Cole), and Bert Large and his son Al. But ""Doc Martin"" and his, well, sparring partner Louisa are both oddballs severely lacking in people skills. It's not as much funny as ridiculous.I guess I am just cynical, but would a heart surgeon have the kind of knowledge displayed by the doctor with the kinds of extremely rare disorders that his patients contract? I mean, Portwenn is a small fishing village...how do these people get these rare disorders, and how come the doctor instantly identifies them by little symptoms such as a scab, or tic, or whatever?Now that I've seen this, I'll probably never watch it again."
5,The BEST series I've seen in a long time!!,"I'm hooked! This series is a treasure. With so much utter junk on TV, this is a breath of fresh air (almost literally). Visually, it's stunning & is an absolute winner. You can almost feel the fresh air fill as you look at the cove. Makes me want to visit there :) Probably had this effect on others too. The characters are wonderful and quirky and I can't help but cheer on the Doc and Louisa. Looking to see how it all ends. Loved it & I highly recommend it; it's great for the WHOLE family!"
4,What Grownup Fun This Is!,"This program is another triumph in the long line of British comedies deserving top spots on American airwaves and in our DVD libraries at home. Martin Clunes has nailed the cranky, haughty, yet deeply insecure and compassionate doctor with a dark secret that makes him the punchline of jokes among lesser medical colleagues, a source of endless entertainment for his new community and a joy to watch for us in the audience. When a top London surgeon has to pack it in and take the position of the only GP in a coastal Cornish village we see a man both brilliant and troubled who has to re-boot his bedside mammer 101 lessons and polish his interpersonal skills if he's going to make the transition work and keep the job. There's a sweetly cheeky and very grown-up romantic sub-plot, village eccentrics with twists you won't see coming, breathtaking Cornish scenery and thought-provoking life lessons. This is a keeper to be savored over and over again!"
4,awkward and hilarious,Maybe it is so funny because I could see this stuff happening to me in a small town like this.
5,It is charming,"Doc Martin apparantly suffers from Asberger's syndrome. He can't help his behavior! He, like most others with this affliction, has limited social skills, habitually says the ""wrong"" thing, and has much difficulty forming friends and social contacts. He's PERFECT! Asberger's is a high functioning form of autism, people with this disorder are often brilliant. Many CPAs, attorneys, doctors, etc are suffers. I adore this program!"
5,A reader from New York City,"After re-reading this book, I now see what a terrific work it is. Please excuse my last review."
4,Great little tale!,I usually enjoy most of the After Dark Horror Fest movies and I really liked this one. It was an intersting little tale that would be great to share by a camp fire. I told my friend the story and that night she was so creeped-out that she called me saying she was afraid to look in her mirror or behind her. I found it an easy and eerie story to tell. I love movies like this one!
1,Boring,"What a waste of time. Boring, cliched, unimaginative. Just wait for it on SyFy if you REALLY have to see it. Better yet, do anything else. Anything."
1,Just an insult to Christians,"That's all this movie is,an ugly tirade against christians in the most despicable,insulting way.How about changing the antagonists and have some of them represent jews,muslims,etc..? Yeah,right. Something is wrong with a movie where you just want deadly witchcraft to destroy,to kill the 'evil"" christian fanatics,where you can't wait for the demonic force to appear and do ""justice""."
3,From Within?,"I heard great things about From Within, therefore I finally watched it last night and I have to say that I thought the majority of the movie was clichéd and at times just plain boring. I'm getting tired of these horror religious plots that go nowhere. Sure, there is a stunning cast, who tried to the best with little they had to work with. The basic plot is that there are several suicides in a small town, in which the church members believe that a deceased devil worshipper's son is involved with the deaths. The actually truth is that the son and his brother cast a suicide spell because the churchgoers had murdered their innocent mother.There were no surprises for me as I could clearly tell who the next victim was. I have to admit that I fell asleep for twenty minutes and I don't think I missed a single thing. As for the ending, I guessed it way before it happened.Overall, From Within is an average horror film at best."
5,A shock to my system,"This movie was easily one of the best of the years ""8 to die for"". The opening sequence is so simple but shocking it haunts you for quite some time. The movie continues at a good pace and finishes with a nice montage of horror. I will own this in my personal collection. Note that the film does play on the themes of intolerance in small town Christianity VS paganism."
5,A book of the greatst importance and value,"When this book first appeared, Time Magazine greeted it as one of the most important books about Shakespeare ever published. It still is, but its great importance has been ignored for half a century. Here we have an examination of a book annotated in the handwriting of William Shakespeare of Stratford. The existence of this book and the conclusions that can be drawn from it are of such major importance as to trasnform the entire field of Shakespeare studies, particularly in light of the subsequent work of Charles Hamilton. I have discussed this matter in Chapter 22 of my book WHY AMERICA'S CHILDREN CAN'T THINK, as well as in my forthcoming book, THE SHAKESPEARE MYSTERIES. Meanwhile you should get a copy of this book if you can, study it carefully and think long and hard about its implications."
3,Hope and Determination,"On September 8, 1900, the island city of Galveston, Texas was hit by an extremely devistating hurricane. The city was almost totally destroyed, and more than 6,000 people were killed. There are many stories of courageous residents who did tremendous things in the face of danger while the storm raged. This is a story about a Galveston family who survived this storm. Ned, a young boy in this family, overcomes his fear of swimming to save his friend, Jimmy. This great story demonstrates the determination of the people of Galveston who banded together to save their city. The city, businesses, and homes had to be rebuilt. A new seawall was eventually built, which has since saved the city from further destruction from hurricanes. This is a great story for every young child."
4,Nice lego set,"This was a nice set that the kids enjoyed building on their own. It wasn't too complicated and actually had all the pieces. Mix up with billing was annoying, but in the end worked out."
1,Yuck!,"What A PAIN in the @#%(!$if this is the same unit that was purchesed from petsmart-It was a major hassle to unroll the fence. The fencing is a series of wires woven together with just loose hooks on the ends to hold them. these hooks catch all over everything and each other, leading to a major tangled mess. Avoid this like the plague"
1,An insult to the music of Bach,"This is a incredible unemotional performance of one of the most moving masterpieces in the history of music. Authenticity ok (see the impressive Leonhardt performance), but there is no excuse for not bringing the notes to life. In that respect Mengelberg is much more 'authentic'. And why must everything sound like as if each musician has to catch the Talis? (to Leipzig?)"
2,I prefer Ann's true crime books,"I am a very big fan of Ann Rule's true crime books. When I bought this book I thought it was another true crime story because the spine of the paperback version is labelled ""Non-fiction"" and the book was in the True Crime section of the bookstore. I was really disappointed when I realized that it was a novel. It wasn't a bad story but certainly wasn't as interesting as Ann's true crime books. I still love and respect Ann Rule as a writer but hope she'll stick to true crime."
1,what was that?,I have every Ann Rule true crime book and have loved every page of them so i happily purchased this book expecting more of her greatness....what I ended up getting was a poor excuse for a book with a female character so weak I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book....This is one Ann Rule book that could disappear from the shelves and it wouldn't upset me one bit.
1,Far Fetched,"A hard-working cop and a bored housewife want a romantic get-away in hopes that she will conceive. Why in God's name would they choose a camping trip, in the middle of nowhere, with bugs, snakes and wild animals. The relationship that ensues between wifey and the stranger is also a stretch.I had to force myself to finish this book. For someone who writes TRUE stories this was a far cry from anything believable. Ms. Rule's true crime stories are excellent. Needless to say, I was disappointed with this book."
1,putrid trash,Possession by Ann Rule is one of the worst pieces of trash I've read--and I have read many books. The plot is virtually non-existent. She relies on crude sex scenes--including glorifying rape--instead of developing a cogent story line. Stereotypes abound such as the alcoholic cop having a sexual relationship with an attorney--boring!
2,A book you can put down,"This was my first Ann Rule book. I found the storyline to be rather dull and the ""possession"" parts to be somewhat disturbing. Although I finished the book, I wouldn't recommend it to someone else.The helpless female didn't do it for me."
1,Ann Rule's finest erotic work.,"Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil ""Red Man"" She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended."
5,This book is very good...,Oh my Gosh... This is a very good book. I cant put it down! This book is sooo good that I had read 14 chapters and had TOTALLY forgot that it was a NOVEL!!!
2,Needs more surprises and thrills,"I almost didn't finish reading Ms. Rule's first work of fiction. She deals with a sinister side of humanity where a reader probably won't find much to admire in any of the characters. They are all flawed with alcoholism, career burnout, or ignorance. As the main characters were being developed, I became somewhat depressed. The story becomes chilling on the camping trip, but I desperately needed more mystery and surprises in the story than I received. I enjoyed seeing Sam's attorney work her legal magic in the pre-trial stage, and I was fairly satisfied with the ending. Although Ms. Rule has obvious talent as a writer, there is other more satisfying fiction in your bookstore dying to be read."
2,POSSESSION by Ann Rule,"I have read several of Ann Rule's books and enjoyed them all, but I did not like this one. This was fiction and dragged on. She had a similar short story among one of her collections, which I enjoyed. I did not like this ending, it would not have turned out that way. I ended up not liking any of the charaters."
2,Possession,"She needs to stick to her true crime books. I am a fan of hers. I would recommend Rule's true crime books, but not this one."
5,Excellent Series! A must read for true sci-fi fans!,An excellent addition to the Dungeon series. This group of characters is unforgettable! The battles within the characters and the battles that they face as a team are awesome. Don't miss this series!
4,magazine showcase,"This was a gift for my mother-in-law, who saw one I had just like it. Great for showcasing my Brett Favre magazines!!"
3,Bookworm,"I LOVE these - they show the beautiful covers of my magazines and keep my bookshelves neat. Unfortunately, they are breakable, especially when the shipper doesn't pad them properly. 5 stars for the product, 2 for the shipping."
3,it's just ok,"wasn't what i was expecting.. size accurate as advertised but did not compensate for a few millimeters on top and bottom therefore it does not fit a magazine. item was a little cracked in the corner but it's not worth time/money sending it back. but should be some quality review on item before packaging and shipping. also was hoping there was a 6th side, but there is not. i know, my bad for not reading thoroughly."
2,other measurements,One thing to know about this products is that the sides flair out so that they do not sit side by side on a shelf - the closed end is more narrow than the back (open) end - do not like the way it looks on the shelf.
5,Never rec'd it,"Well, I saw this movie on tv and tried to buy a copy of it but it never showed up............the movie on tv was great!"
1,Nothing like the book.,I was very disappointed when I watched this movie. I read the book and there are so many things that are in the book that are left out of the movie...OH and the fact that the wrong person dies in the movie...Not a fan of it
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"I agree with many of the other people who had read the book. Why did they change so much of the book for the movie??? The ending of the book was very shocking, but thats what made it an amazing book. The end of the movie was just STUPID!!! So many characters and character plot lines were left out of the movie, why??!?! Dont rent, buy or watch this movie. Read the book, you will be much happier!! I also found the girl who played the sick sister to be an annoying actress!!!"
3,Not sorry I paid for the rental but wouldn't do it again,"Like every book I've read that has been made into a movie; the book is better. While I understand that Hollywood has to take artistic license with movie making this was done with a liberal hand. The ending is completely different from the book. The surface of the brother's(Jesse) troubled youth is only scratched and the marital strain is hinted and and once agin not fully explored. I guess you can only do so much in two hours which is coincidentally how long it took me to read the book, although i will confess I have now read it through about 5 times. I cannot say that I would view this movie more than once."
3,ok movie,"This movies is a chick flick. It is good enough, but not great. I like Abigail Breslin and she was good in it. Good movie to rent, not to own."
2,Terrible remake of the book...,"I;m sorry, but the movie was a terrible depiction of the book. So many subplots were taken away and so much of the books entertaining essence was no where to be seen. The actors did a great job, I can't complain, but the movie in general was pretty awful compared to the book. It was made very tedious by focusing merely on the main story, and the ending was no where near as good or heart wrenching as that of the book. To me the books ending added the ironic twist and was very unpredictable.The story between Julia and Campbell was my favorite in the book- the movie completely eliminated it. I also would of liked more time spent on Jess.Not recomended to those who read the book.If you haven't read this, it might entertain you and probably bring out a tear or two, but to me it was just a big dissapointment to what was an excellent book :("
3,Just okay.,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, after reading the book. I was disappointed, as the book is so much better. I would have liked the movie to follow the same ending as the book. I would highly recommend that you read the book BEFORE seeing the movie."
2,"Distant, and Not by the Book","I was so excited to see they had made a Jodi Picoult novel into a movie.. I was very disappointed to find the movie was so distant from the characters, and the story line was off. I've read several Jodi Picoult novels.. and the movie portrayal just doesn't do her writing any justice. I watched the movie once, I don't think I ever will again. If you haven't read any of her novels it'd probably be a good watch... if you have I'm sure you would be able to recognize the difference from her writing."
2,See that shark? Yeah jumped right over it.,"Having been in a few different book clubs, this seems to be one of the ""must reads"" because I have read the book that this movie is based on a few times. Which, of course, means that I hated the movie. *laugh*But that's not exactly true. It was really good until the last 30 minutes or so when it completely jumped the shark. It changed the ending, obviously, but to me, it changed the message behind it. I was too shocked to get teary, I just kind of stared at the screen.So, I'm not sure that I would recommend it. Read the book, skip the movie unless it's on the $0.99 clearance."
2,"2.5, So-So Movie, Book Was Better!","Why even follow a story from a book if it won't be followed as the book does??!! The movie was poorly done, jumping around from present, to past without a good flow. The story was ok because it did follow the book, at least through a good portion of it. Although, I don't recall Kate and her boyfriend getting naked in the book.I agree with other reviewers who have read this book, the movie ending sucked! One thing about Picoult's books, they are usually thought provoking. This movie lacked anything causing such a reaction. All it did was play on heart strings.Glad I didn't waste money at the movies or buying this. Its a rental movie..nothing more.Read the book!"
3,Book was much better!,"I think this would make a great Lifetime movie. I thought it was slow moving at times and it veered so much from the book! If you want to get the message of the story, read the book!"
2,Its better if you haven't read the book,"I know that everytime a book is made into a movie things have to be cut and or changed but this is ridiculous. They cut out Jesse's side of the story (well they had a little but not much). The ending made me a little mad. Kate was NOT supposed to die, Anna was supposed to die in a car accident. After the accident the family then took everything Kate would possibly need from Anna and Kate survived. This was an ok movie but it would seem better if you hadnt read the book. Otherwise if they stayed true to the book it would have been a great movie."
1,What's With the Ending?,"I read the book which was riveting - the issues of medical emancipation, ethics, each character's history was explored. In the movie, each character was represented by 'talk-over', which ruined it. No connection was possible. The ending in the book. which just knocked my socks off . . . was left OUT! That made the entire read and rendered the movie one star. Played frizbee with the CD when it was over. Huge disappointment."
1,Awful!,They ruined a fantastic book with this movie by completely changing the ending. The ending of the book was so interesting that I was very angry after watching how they changed it in the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and would instead encourage them to read the book. This is one of the worst movie adaptations of a book that I have seen.
5,Best Ever,This movie was one of the best tear jerks i have ever watched. It is so realistic. I loved it.
4,Loved it!,"I read the book, and I didn't like the ending of the book as it felt like a cop out to me. The ending of the movie was much more satisfying to me. Be prepared to cry!"
2,WHY the ending change?,"Although the original book was great, the movie had a totally different ending. WHY do authors allow their books to be mutilated for the big screen? One thing WAS good about the movie: the mom was shown to be a horrible, controlling, rage-filled monster. The way she treats her youngest daughter, Anna, as a donor for Kate is just disgusting. One gets the feeling that she'd like to put Anna into a drug-induced coma and just carve her up for parts. It's chilling. In reality, Anna would have severed all ties to her mother as soon as she could do it -- they wouldn't have had any relationship left. Jason Patric was excellent as the long-suffering dad, torn between his evil wife and his youngest child."
4,Thanks for changing the ending!,"This movie is a real tear jerker and I doubt I would buy it just to watch it for pleasure, but there are strong, sensitive performances by all of the main actors and Sofia Vassilieva makes a very memorable Kate, a dying teenager who still wants to look pretty at the dance and falls in love with a fellow cancer patient. The movie, like the book, raises some timely questions about what happens when a human being is created to serve the needs of another, how far is too far and how to balance the rights of one person against the needs of another. I do want to say a heartfelt thank you to the producers for changing the ending of the movie from the book. I HATED the ending of the book. This movie ending is so much better and more appropriate."
3,The book is MUCH better!,"I hated how the movied completely changed the ending of how the book actually ended. I think that the book is much better and if you like this movie, you should read the book."
4,Good movie!,"Bought this the other day. Really good movie. If you have kids, you'll be touched by this. Great acting all-around!"
3,Touching but vain,"This was a very good movie as far as acting and plot but it gave such an empty message about life. The actors were great, very convincing and lively. The story was good, very touching. What I did not like was how empty and vain it made me feel about life in general."
3,movie skips,The movie arrrived in a timely manner...howerver toward the end of the movie it would get stuck and I could not fast forward or reverse it so I could not see the ending.. I had read the book first and was told the ending was totaly different in the movie so I was dissapointed to not see it..but I was told how the movie ended..I probably should have written the seller about this first but didn't...I apologize for not doing that first.
4,boo hoo,"this movie always makes me cry, but I'm so glad to finally own it. I'm waiting for a good, alone night, where I can snuggle with it and cry!"
5,"""Tear Jerker""","I'm not one to cry during movies, but this one really got to me. It was a very well thought out movie with a lot of heart and soul put in to it. Definitely would recommend it to anyone who likes a movie that really tugs at your heart."
4,Much better than I expected....,"When I saw the previews for this movie, I knew this would be my kind of movie. I love a good cry every now and then. However, I was a little concerned with Cameron Diaz cast as the role of the mother, Sara Fitzgerald. As a matter of fact, after seeing the movie, I would still say she was my least favorite part of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Cameron Diaz's work, but in comedies usually. Abigail Breslin does a superb job as little sister Anna Fitzgerald. Sofia Vassilieva plays Anna's big sister Kate, who has had a lifelong battle with Leukemia. Sofia did, in my opinion, an amazing job. Throughout the whole movie, I was thinking to myself, I can handle this. But in the end, I could not. So if you are planning on seeing it, be sure to have the tissues handy."
4,Touching story,Very touching story...I shed some tears through it and had some laughs.. I found it humbling and heartwarming.
1,SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! READ THE BOOK!,I am disappointed in Ms. Picoult to sign over so much creative control that they rewrote her book. I am suprised she would put her name on it!I read this the first time when it came out and I have been a Picoult reader since. This is trash! Alot of readers dont understand the will to live and the will to die are sometimes all it takes. Mind over matter. So after waiting to see this (missing it in theaters) I bought it. I made my husband sit and watch it with me. Just so he can see me take it out of my DVD player and put it straight into the trash!!!!!
2,about movie description,"The movie is good and great story that touches everyone`s heart but in the language n subtitles it is english and francais not english and spanish like I saw here in the product description, next time they should be shure about the correct info of the dvd."
3,My Sister's Keeper,"If you've read the book and loved the ending like I did, then you'll be sorely disappointed in this movie. The switch ruined my chance to enjoy the movie like my sister when we went to see it. She had never read the book and throughly enjoyed the movie. Other than that the rest of the movie was great, at least worth a rental or a buy when the price drops."
1,Outdated Unusable Software,The Product Activation Severs at Voyetra Have Been Disconnected PermanentlySo The Software Cannot Be Activated Or Used Ever. In Fact The Entire VoyetraMusic Software Division Has Been Closed-Out By Turtle Beach And No Longer Exists.So None Of The Software Created By Voyetra Will Work Anymore. So Be Advised.
3,nice swim suit sizing is poor,"The swim suit is very nice quality, but seems to be about a size smaller than what it is marked."
4,Corny but Wholesome,"The jokes may be a bit corny and hackneyed, but are great for children and are a refreshing change from the often mean-spirited, expletive-laden trash that passes for humor nowadays. If you want some good clean fun and something your kids can enjoy, you'll like this book."
1,terrible,Not even worth 5 bucks... Enough said! Doesn't even deserve one star. I returned the item for my money back and recommend that you dont waste your time like i did
3,Not so easy to remove,"I purchased this product primarily to find a drug store brand mascara that is as easy to remove as Clinique's Curling mascara or Christian Diorshow. While the advertisement touted easy removal, it was much harder to remove than the Clinique or Diorshow. Disappointed."
1,not all I had hoped,"I have been trying various mascaras for longer lush lashes (mine have thinned as I have gotten older), so tried Double Extend. Not happy with it. I don't want to spend 20 minutes putting on mascara, curling my lashes etc... I want a product that makes my eyes stand out right out of the bottle. Was hoping that this product with the ""primer"" would yield lovely lashes, but my lashes looked no different than when I used a cheaper Maybeline product. In fact they looked less long and full. I am now using Lancome Hypnose Drama and am much happier with the result!"
1,Don't buy it!,"My mother requested me to buy to her the 'L'Oreal Volume Shocking Waterproof mascara', because was her favorite. Since it was discontinued, I looked for a L'Oreal mascara with double brushes, and I guessed that this Double Extend Mascara was as good as the Volume series. But surprise, my mother as soon she tried it out, she expressed her angry, she claimed that it wasn't leaving her eyelashes straight up, and the content was very liquid, she was totally dissapointed.We returned the product and we got reimbursed. At least Amazon has an excellent and serious return policy, but the 'L'Oreal Double Extend Mascara' is a scam, don't buy it!"
1,I could have written this study guide myself,"This study guide is horrible. While it serves as an adequate review of material that is covered up to the level of education prospective teachers are expected to accomplish,it is poorly edited and does not provide accurate details about the structure of the test. I would advise anyone preparing to take the Praxis II Spanish test to refrain from purchasing this study guide. The official study guide published by ETS is very good and can be used in combination with a good grammar guide and materials from your literature and culture courses."
5,Stunning,"I had this bracelet on my wish list for a long time. When it went on sale recently, I made the leap and bought it. And, I have to say, it is absolutely beautiful. It was still pretty pricey even on sale, but worth it. I love Zina jewelry, and this is probably my favorite Zina piece. Highly recommended."
1,This Disaster Thriller Is A Disaster!,"As usual, John Nance is the master when he describes an airline disaster. Unfortunately, in Blackout his characters are so poorly developed and, in particular, his dialogue rings SO untrue that they completely outweigh the suspense Nance tries to maintain throughout the book. Usually I am not that critical of these factors as long as the plot is very strong. This is definitely not the case in Blackout. As a matter of fact, because of these factors I had to give up on this book with over 100 pages still to go. Save yourself from this disaster and thrill yourself with another book! I'd highly recommned Peter Blauner's Man Of The Hour."
5,Don't miss this one,"You first must realize that this is a work of fiction and written to please the reader. Mr. Nance has done all this. Could it happen? I don't know. Did it keep me interested all the time? Yes. We have an author who does not use sex to sell, an author who uses violence when needed, but again not to sell the book.This is a book to enjoy both for the plot and the characters. I wondered throughout the entire book as to how it would end. There were a lot of times I thought I had it figured out and then I was not so sure. There are just enough players to keep you guessing and on edge.Buy this book. All his books have been good and this is as good or better."
4,Blackout- by John J. Nance,"As is usual with Nance's aviation thrillers, I kept turning the pages enthusiastically, with each event building on the next. Blackout started quickly, moving along with a lot of suspense. Then, I started to get a little bored with the story. But, suddenly, it became quick again, and I didn't want to put it down. My favorite book is still Pandora's Clock, though. Here is how I would rate Nance's books:1. Pandora's Clock 2. Medusa's Child 3. The Last Hostage 4. Blackout 5. Scorpion's Strike 6. Phoenix Rising 7. Final ApproachNow I am waiting for his new book Headwind to come out. I am sure that will be another good one."
4,This book was very enjoyable,"For those who can't see the wonderfull entertainment in this book, to bad! This was a fast paced, edge of the seat book, i usually read books slowly, something around 6 weeks, this one only took 2 i was so hook. At times the intensity got to me and i had to put it down. Very Enjoyable read."
1,... and even that star is one too much :(,"Well I'm absolutely disapointed ! I like to read books with airplanes and am ready to forgive a lot of wrong plots, impossible survivals and so on.But this book is very strange. Leaders of major organisations are playing dumb - just an example : CIA tells the President, that a jumbo pilot may have been blinded by crashing into a smaller jet, because the explosion of the smaller jet before his cockpit was so bright - and still its known, that the jumbo was absolutely free of damage - and the President is buying that explanation ...Well, most of the people in the book are unrealistic and unpleasant. Women in the wrong footwear drag ablebodied man that try to resist through the forrest of Vietnam ... and so on. Just buy another book. This one is just plain bad."
4,Very Realistic,"If you are a pilot, you will find this book very accurate. The scary thing is that this technology does exist and hopefully it never falls into the wrong hands."
2,"all foam, no beer","If this book were made into a movie, it would have a lot of chase scenes and plane wrecks. But even chase scenes get boring after awhile. Not much character development and a simplistic writing style give the book little substance. The description of the plane crash in the first chapter of the book was gripping, but by the second or third wreck is was ""ho-hum."""
2,The first time I've been truly disappointed by Nance,"I've read several of John Nance's novels and been drawn in by the plot of every single one up until now. The number of positive reviews on Amazon of Blackout puzzles me. I found the number of chases to be reminicent of a bad action movie that relies on car chases and stunts to cover up a lack of plot. The characters in Blackout were shallow and stereotypical and not at all believeable.Generally I will read a novel in a few days, but this one took me two weeks because I kept putting it aside after reading one unbelieveable encounter after another. I did finish it, because I wanted to know how it would all wrap up, and truthfully, not much was wrapped up at all.I would recommend Phoenix Rising, or even Turbulence, but not Blackout. It was just BAD."
4,great,The action is so real that it seems that you are right there. The mystery of who is behind everything holds you captivated.
5,Blackout -- a constant thriller...,Blackout kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way though. This was really the first book in which I couldn't tell what was going to happen next. It has a twisted plot with a fantastic ending. I would definately recommend this book to others.
2,Too messy,"This juicer is too messy and wastes too much juice. A reamer is sooo much better, though this looks great."
2,Gift ?,"True to its title, the book talks of travel as a gift, as a present. It consists of 31 short stories about travel set in different parts of the world - Spain, Mexico, India, France, Tibet, USA............The stories are not exceptional and cannot replicate the gift / joy of actual travel as any intrepid traveller will tell you. Some of the stories seem contrived like the one set in Canary Islands (""Letting Life Happen""). There are others which evoke and want to make us travel there (e.g. the story set in Tibet, ""A Tibetan picnic"").All in all, can be avoided. Better travel literature exists."
4,Early and Late Schoenberg,"Pelleas & Melisande is rarely recorded or heard, but is an interesting piece nonetheless. It betrays Schoenberg's roots in Strauss and Wagner, yet it certainly has distinctive touches to it. As one would expect, Boulez gives a controlled and slightly cool performance. The Variations are one of Schoenberg's greatest pieces. They are the result of his synthesis of twelve-tone technique and the lyricism which he achieved late in life. Again, Boulez is restrained, though with more emotion than he sometimes brings to the more abstract pieces by the memebers of the second Viennese school."
2,No longer a Symantec customer,"Caveat EmptorI have used Norton products for many years but no more. Their activation scheme is a disaster. After installation it's a matter of time before you be asked to activate the software again and again and finally you will get a message that activation with your key is not possible, you might have a pirated version. I bought this application from Symantec via the net, grrrrr.Another benefit, my computer runs faster!! NIS is a huge resource hog and would hang the system occasionally. I have a powerful PC. AMD 3500 64/1 gig ram.http://www.sonic.net/~weasel/symantec.html"
1,"""Norton Internet Security"": OR my software nightmare.","Yes, a nightmare, you dream about, start and restart, install and uninstall for this abominable excuse for a piece of programmed software. Error messages, just a sample, LU1812, LU1803, LU1814, 9999.71, and the DELETE from their internet site, impossible..all their site requests relate to actions that just cannot be activated, remedial suggestions are not workable. It is, by far the winner of the Golden Fish Bone award for the STRESS ACTIVATOR 2006.Amazons review wont accept a zero rating."
1,Another formerly loyal symantec customer,"I'm leaving symantec. . . I almost purchased the 2006 upgrade a few days ago. When I went in to complete the purchase today -- my subscription expired today - the cost of the upgrade was $10 more. In addition, I was being offered an extended download ""service"" for $8.99 that would give me the ability to redownload in the event I needed to reinstall it. Since when do you need to pay to redownload something you have already purchased?"
2,Aweful Tech Support,"Well, actually, I've never been able to talk to tech support. I've had the 2004 version for 14 months, I can no longer call them for tech support. They don't tell you your tech support will run out when you renew. I spent 30 minutes on hold through automated operator hell before finding out nobody would help me. Strange, I never needed tech support until a day after it ran out and my system did a live update...almost as if they are forcing me into upgrading to a newer version.Also, if you order this prodcut, be aware that about 2 months before it runs out they will start encouraging you to renew it for another year. Don't renew until the last minute. If you renew early, your year long subscripion starts the day you renew, not the day it was due to run out. They don't tell you that either.The actual program is pretty user friendly."
1,Does not identify virus; no way to notify Symantec of viruses it cannot identify,"I have had an adware virus (Virtumondo)(creator Virtumonde) on my pc for over a month. Symantec can not detect it or remove it. Microsoft AntiSpyware detects it, but is unable to successfully remove it. Symantec has a removal tool for adware.VirtuMonde, but it also cannot detect it to remove this variant. There used to be a means to report (new) virus problems to Symantec, but apparently no more. Their only option is to pay them $39.95 to $69.95 (again) to help you find and remove a virus. I don't have a problem with a solution for a new variant of a virus not being available immediately, but I do after a month and I do with them assuming they know everything and do not need to provide a means to report viruses Symantec cannot detect. I've been a Norton customer for many years; not anymore."
1,"Norton provides no custmer service, product doesn't work","Having used Norton for years, and being satisfied I purchased the new 2006 Internet Security version, removed my older Norton version (becuase you have to in order to install the new one) and it won't install. Long story made short, still can't make it work, and most bizarre of all: YOU CAN NOT REACH NORTON SUPPORT AT ALL. Oh yes, they have an email only contact, but you will get back a standard report, that in this case had nothing to do with my problem. NEVER DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN"
2,Great Security that will make your new system crawl,A new 64 bit AMD processor with 1 Gig of RAM can't run this hog. Thought dial up was slow? Get a whole new meaning of slow and buy this product. Customer service is good enough to warrant another star in the rating. Keep 2004 version if you can.
1,This is Junkware,"I have used Norton products for many years without a problem, including Norton Internet Security 2005. Recently I purchased NIS 2006. What a mistake. Every time I run a virus scan, the computer crashes. Total lights out, power down, blank screen! Three sessions with the very polite but not-much-help Symantec online tech support staff in India could not find a solution. (I should have to PAY THEM for phone support when their product won't run correctly??) Uninstalling and reinstalling was no help, either. This is the last Norton product for me."
1,Subscription service rip-off!,"The manner in which Symantec treats its paying customers is one of the worst I have ever come across. If you pay for several years of virus updates and then let the subscription expire, any crash of your computer or (in my case) the NIS software itself leaves you with virus definitions that can be many years old - whatever is shipped on the CD. They do not allow you to re-download the updated virus definitions to the point where your subscription expired without paying AGAIN! A complaint to the support people was returned with a SPAM-like email trying to get me to buy the new version. This same subscription approach is present in the 2006 software. AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
1,Waste of Money,"I bought Norton Internet Security and it has been pitiful. From the moment I installed it, it's been a pain in the you know what. It messes up Outlook and other programs so badly, I disable it every time I turn on my computer. I just got the notice to renew my subscription and I thought, ""Why have a antivirus software that isn't ever on?"" I'm so happy to REMOVE this program from my computer and find another brand. If you're considering buying this, Don't Do It!"
1,Disappointed - Not for Home Networks,"I upgraded from a previous version - which was difficult to impossible to begin with. Once installed, the program did not work well with my home network; I could not include a trusted IP addresses in my home network; so that one computer could not access the Internet thru the built-in Fire Wall. I returned it."
1,Every Year the software fails to insall properly,Every year the installation of this software turns into a major hassle. The software doesn't properly uninstall the prior version and I have a mess on my hands. Every year. When is Symantec going to wake up? When am I going to wise up and buy some other company's product. This is ridiculous really.
3,Norton Internet Security (2006),Very slow upon start-up! It takes a minute or so to load. I run another program to clean up ads. I still run my old utilities program from a CD because the microsoft repair program did not come with this application. My only other experience is with an old McAfee program (2002) that allowed a virus to pass that Norton found upon installation. I want a feature to better block the info that is collected by my ISP (Yahoo).
4,So far so good,"This product saves my time during startup. Earlier I had McAfee which consumed minutes to load by itself after I chose to logon.This starts scanning the system when ever it feels doubtfull of the PC usage.Compare to McAfee, McAfee used to ask the user to grant permission if any new exe is suppose to run, so we will be notified of each exe call, but this doesn't.Overall I can say that my PC is safe so far (2 months)."
1,SCARED TO TRY IT!,"Hi I had norton internet security 2004 . It did'nt like to load my e-mail at first try until I rebooted my computer! Mine has expired now and I need a good anti virus protection and I had purchesed it from Symantec downloadable from their site and I had to ask for a refund because it would""t download. They did not offer a cheap enough renew for 2004 They of course want you to buy something more expensive. Their cheapest renew is 39.99.You could go out and buy a new antivirus for that! Have to try other products beware!"
4,norton internet security 2006,"we are happy with our norton. we learned before hand touninstall everything first. so when we did install we had noproblems. the program works well and detects any problems.we also use avg and they work well together. we ran into onevirus that both detected but would not let use use thevault or quartine. but the norton site helped us get rid of it.no problems. we had tried to use zone alarm, but it blockedtoo many sites, so norton was easier for us to use. wewould highly recommend."
5,Norton Internet Security 2006,"This blocks spam, viruses, and pop-ups. Sometimes almost too much but there are ways to control what you want to allow and what you want to block. I have had Norton Security before and have always been pleased with it."
1,Product is deactivated after every reboot,"Like many others, I also have issues with NIS. The product deactivates after every reboot, leaving my computer unprotected most of the time. After I activate (after every startup) it works fine.Indian outsourced support is completely useless. They copy & paste some articles based on some keywords.I am about to uninstall and buy a competing product simply because this product deactivated is as useful as not having an Internet Security product at all.I do not recommend this suite."
2,Support is non-existent,"I am quite frustrated with not being able to adequately download or launch the Norton Internet Security 2006 software. I have spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to install this product, and support is not as accessible as Norton makes you think. The number written on the website is a for-fee support line. I've tried emailing to ask for a refund and the ""contact us"" area on the site is not working. Norton makes it easy to take your money and impossible to receive assistance. I give up but want others to know so that maybe they will become more cooperative."
1,Terrible Upgrade,"I have been using Norton products since DOS 3.2, this is by far, the worst.I was upgrading from 2005 version. New version did NOT pick up any spam rules from old version, new spam rules are ignored, when you try to configure, program routinely hangs.Looking to find another suite."
1,Buggy to say the least!,"Let me start out saying I would not even dare try Norton 2006. I have been a customer of Norton since I got my first computer years ago but finally I GIVE UP!!!I have Norton 2005 and it has given me nothing but grief and the latest is asking for an activation code when I just bought and activated the 2005 version in August 2005 - I have wasted way too much time in trying to work out the kinks in this security system. If you google this problem you will find pages and pages of people frustrated with this same problem and Norton doesn't even send out a patch to fix this error nor have they shwon that they even care.I used to read these reviews and think ""Oh what do these people know?"" and now I am one of those people.STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS SYSTEM AS POSSIBLE!!!!"
1,Another sucker for Norton,"I thought I would protect my new computer. Norton should be ashamed of itself for daring to put such a shoddy, ill functioning piece of software on the market. I won't be wasting any more of my hard earned dollars on Symantec rubbish. Wonder if I'll get frozen again when I send this. DON'T BUY Norton Antivirus 2006!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I had been informed that this program would block the malware WinFixer. Although upon installing on my system, it really didn't do anything except slow my system down. When it ran a scan for spyware, it couldn't find any, although both Ad-Aware and Spybot did. It failed to block or remove WinFixer as well.The only nice thing about it was that it seems to automate itself well, although I found it repetively making personal firewalls for everything rather annoying. Nor is it customizable. My laptop is short on RAM, and Norton only used up most of what was left, making it difficult to do anything while it ran. If your system has RAM to spare, then this shouldn't be a problem.Overall, I was disappointed. The program couldn't identify obivous problems, which makes it rather useless."
1,never succeeful full scan the hard disk.,It is too slow for 200G hard disk. I have total 300 G hard disk C:/D:/E;it run over 12 hours still not finish c:
1,A virus is less troublesome,"I agree with all the negative reviews. I've been a happy Norton customer for years, but this is the worst thing I've ever installed on my computer. In the past, Norton has helped me through some difficult times, but now IT is the problem."
3,Norton Internet Security 2006 [Old Version,Norton Internet Security 2006 [Old Version - The Amazon reviews for this product listed that it considerably slowed down their computer operating systems. They were right. I would not recommend buying this version.
1,Norton Internet Security,This product is pathetic. If you have a home wireless network you simply should not get this product- you will end up uninstalling it and throwing it away. It's apparent that Norton is riding on it's name rather then creating useable products being someone who has used Norton with great satifaction in the past. Not internet security. When a software clogs up and takes over your system and makes your experience worse then the problems it says it's protecting you against you know it's time to move on.
1,Avoid at all cost,"NIS 2005 caused me to have to reformat my hard drive and reinstall everything. NIS 2006 was worse. When it was partially functional, it slowed my computer to a 10 minute reboot and 45 seconds to open an email. I worked on it for over 40 hours, uninstalling and reinstalling, trying every solution on their site including changing registry entries and three calls to their support staff. I ended up with blue screens and had to download a special program from their site to remove it, under safe mode.I switched to ZASS and had it up and running on both computers in 15 minutes."
2,"Subscription update solution for 2004,2005? Update to latest live update!!","Yeah im just a kid. I found my subscription was stopped by norton expired! with 3 months left.After the same frusteration that has been encountered by most,said why not update lussetup for live update did that and let their tools do their magic and guess what i get updates on 2004!!! Im sure symantec will corect this so you have to pay .Thanks norton.You have a tool that works.Just a Kid!"
4,Much better than my older version,"I always used Norton because I never trusted another program like Norton. I used the Internet Security 2003 on my laptop and it worked fine. It slowed down the computer, yes, but I never had a virus or something else on my PC since then. But this version, 2006, is much better than my old. My laptop is much faster and the programs are working steady and the user interface is also so much easier to handle. The Updates come constantly and the firewall works great (and has a learning function to learn automatically which programs are safe and which you want to use). But the problems about the slowness are still there, it takes up time before I can use my pc after putting it on and a full system check takes much time, too. Anyhow I would recommend Norton 2006 as a full system securing which is good to use with other (freeware) programs like Spybot Search & Destroy , Ad-Aware SE Personal, eTrust PestPatrol and so on you also should have installed."
1,Piece of Junk,"This worthless piece of crap cost me two hours on a Saturday afternoon. It completely torched the internet service on my brother's computer. Unfortunately, he bought it, installed it and then called me to fix it when it trashed his computer. It was difficult to log on to the net after it was installed and then if you did get on you would get dumped after a few seconds. He has an HP running Windows XP Home. You couldn't navigate to other sites. After trying to work around it I finally just pulled the plug and took it off. Guess what? The computer now works fine. He spent $59 on more worthless software from the guardians of nothing. Think they should go back to doing what they do best which is creating viruses and spyware which they can they write software for and sell it to us as protection. Yuk. If you lock up using it simply hit the uninstall feature, which appears to be the only thing in the package that actually works."
3,Good protection but slow anti-virus scanning,"This is a great program for preventing virus and other security attacks. Installation is easy and the people at Symantec have made the program as easy to use as possible.The modules of the program share a common interface that you can largely set and forget. Most users will never have to tweak them, but the capability is there if you need it.My issue with this version of Internet Security, and why the program only gets three stars, is the length of time needed to perform a full system scan. A scan that took about four hours using Internet Security 2005 seems to take at least seven hours with the 2006 release.Perhaps the scanning algorithms have been improved or something similar. I haven't spent time researching the increase in scanning time.All in all, Internet Security 2006 is a good product that I rely on for protection from all of the threats in email and on the web.I've used Symantec products for over ten years and they haven't yet failed."
3,Works but very inefficient user of CPU Memory,"This is a good product but you have to wonder why can't they make one that is efficient in its use of space on your hard drive and not so memory and storage space intensive. The Wash Post tech editor says you might be better served by downloading AVG for free from [...]for viruses and using Windows own security system. Alas, once you install Norton you find it hard to get it off your PC, it conflicts with other programs and you need to pay for a new one each year!"
1,Miserable product,"I had Norton Internet Security 2005 on my PC from the manufacture. When my one year subscription expired I updated to NIS 2006 and in the upgrade process it wiped out all of the setting and configuration info that I laboriously entered into NIS2005 during the last year - including several hundred blocked email addresses, firewall rules etc. All I can get out of the miserable indian tech support is 'sorry for the inconvenience - type the information in again'.In addition to the above I have lost some functionality that was present in NIS2005 and they have added more bloatware to my system that I really don't want.I will not buy this product for my other PC's"
1,Save your money,"Wish I'd have read these reviews BEFORE I spent my money, save yours! It is all these reviwers say it is and nothing that Notorn claims it is. I won't rehash my experiences, they're similar to those below, how such a good product could become so lousy in 3 years is beyond my comprehension. Dilbert works here!!"
1,A complete piece of junk: Don't do it!,"After it took two frustrating calls to the customer support to get this piece of junk installed, I should have know better. If you want 5 - 7 minute boot-ups, minute long waits for every document to open, 30 second page loads on the net--in other words if you want to go back to the 1980s, go ahead and buy it."
1,Horrible,"Since I've installed their software I am receiving 50 times more spam than without their anti-spam program. I am sick and tired of deleting it and entering new entries. I don't recommend their security suite, you'll be more secure without their program."
1,Utter crap,"This program has been damaged by a virus, and no matter what I do, I cannot uninstall it so I can either try installing it again, or use another program. Something happened such that the Quarantine file grew to over 12GB of disk space, and one cannot delete/remove/or even access it. The program locks up if you try, and if you try to manually delete it via Windows, instant system hardlock.I've tried using the uninstall program, and even after letting it sit overnight, it still isn't done; it lists multiple errors. I'm probably going to have to reformat the hard drive and reinstall the OS to get this system up and running again. The program is terribly invasive and a real resource hog as well...the system is soooo slow with NIS 2006 installed.Norton might have been a good company at one time, but no more. Avoid their products like the plague."
1,Garbage,"As a regular Norton customer and as a tech-support professional, I must tell you that this product is garbage. The software doesn't function properly and is annoyingly buggy plus the costly tech-support is absolutely shameful."
1,Beware this product if you are upgrading from previous version,"I recently upgraded from an earlier version of Norton to NIS 2006 and that began a whole litany of problems - slower computer speed, inability to open MS Office documents, inability to access the internet, inability to shut down using either ""shut down"" or ""restart"" buttons, among others. Brought my laptop to a local repair shop. The technician informed me that NIS 2006 is a very aggressive program and can cause conflicts with the MS operating system itself. Additionally, installation of NIS 2006 requires complete removal of the previous version(s). Simply using ""Add/Remove Program"" will not assure complete removal and therefore when NIS 2006 is installed there may be conflicts with remnants of the legacy Norton program. The technician did a complete uninstall of NIS 2006 and I have since purchased McAffee Virus Scan which seems to be doing the trick."
2,I should have passed this one up,I just spent two days trying to install this piece of software that I downloaded. If I had read the reviews I could have saved myself a lot of headaches. After I downloaded it would not install. I had no clue as to what the problem was. I go on to Norton website where you have to read through page after page of vague instructions. I finally stumbled into autofix. This is suppose to detect and fix your problem. But hello guess what I go to step two and the web page is down. Ok I'm looking for a telephone number now where I can speak to a live person. Finally in tiny yellow letters I see where they offer tech support for an additional $29.99. I finally managed to get the thing installed mostly by trial and error. Meanwhile my computer was unprotected. I'm really hoping that I don't have any attacks on my computer because I don't have much faith in Norton's ability to stop it. When this expires I will not be renewing my subscription.
1,Nortons internet security 2006/bad buy,"purchased a new computer. installed nortons internet security 2006 on it and my beautiful, fast, accurate system is now as bad as an early 386!! i can't even uninstall it (Is there a way?) tech support sent me to a website that offered to sell me additional norton's products and no help. i can't even uninstall w/ add remove/ or wipe programs. it hangs up my system whenever i try to access it or other programs as well, forget about being able to see my email! right click on the systems tray icon and the computer freezes. my new system is a mess!!!!! i do not trust norton's any more. i gave it a 1 star because there was no zero choice."
2,Ugggh!! What a Nightmare!!,"I've been a NIS user for the last 3 years and have never had any problems. It was time to renew my subscription so I decided to upgrade to NIS 2006 which had a free copy of GoBack. I've had nothing but issue from the get go. I kept getting pop-ups and pop-unders. I was unable to get AntiVirus to run a full system scan. It would start and then just close down. I tried their fixes, did the live chat, uninstalled and reinstalled a dozen times getting same results each time. I reinstalled my NIS 2003 version and ran a full system scan with no problem. At this point I'm fed up and disappointed in a product that I liked very much."
2,Newer is NOT better.,"I had a prior version (NIS 2003) and was very pleased with it. I ignored poor reviews and complaints about recent versions of NIS and upgraded when the older version was no longer supported. I should have heeded the reviews as all their problem became mine. It noticeably slows down your computer, your email, your web browsing...and has applicaiton errors when you shutdown/log off windows.After one month I took a risk and purchased Zone Alarm 2006 and have been extremely pleased: no, it's not ""perfect"" but it works well, actually seems to catch things NIS didn't and it doesn't seem to slow down the computer (noticeably better performance than NIS).As a web programmer I'm both a perfectionist but realize, when it comes to software, nothing's perfect....but Symantec could do much better. And if so many people have so many common complaints you think they'd take notice (I guess market share it all that matters)."
1,Lack of supoort makes product useless,"Since Symantec refuses to provide any customer support for the products they sell it has become dangerous to install their products. There are other companies selling products that work at least as well, are more stable, do less damage to you computer and that provide real support. If a Symantec product fails to work you get to pay them $29.95, to start with, for help and there is no guarantee that the person on the phone has a clue as to what they are saying, normally just reading from a computer screen with no real knowledge. My advice, after having spent years buying and using Norton/Symantec, is to look else where for all products."
1,Norton let us down... hard!,"A choice of 0 stars should be available!We have used Norton for many years. The NIS 2006 caused all kinds of problems. First my computer slowed down...then stopped. We had to remove and re-install all programs, including Windows XP. Norton customer service was no help. Thanks to Dell Computers customer service, we are almost back to normal after 5 days of work. Tax software and clients' data going back 7 years, QuickBooks, Quicken were all at risk. Fortunately, we had everything backed up on an external drive.We will never use or recommend Norton again! If Norton's customer service had been more courteous and helpful, we might not have come to this decision.El-Amin Business ServicesRichmond, Virginia"
1,Norton Internet Security Suite 6.0,Norton Internet security suite is bar far the worst product I have ever used. This product gave me problems starting up and slowed my computer to crawl. Also this product is virtually impossible to un-install and when I called support the wanted to charge me $40 to help me un-istall their product which they will not support. I had to format my hard and reload all my software and get all the updates for Windows XP pro. I have a 3.0 gig dual core processor and 2 gigs of DDR2 Ram. In review Norton 2006 Security Suite SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.
1,Had to remove due to poor performance.,"Terrible program. Always in your face, kind of like windows does but even worse. Just want to install and forget, not have to interface with every day. Really slowed down the computer. Even uninstalling this app took unbelievably long. Norton really seems to make their apps way more complicated than necessary."
2,security,I was not happy with the resource hogging nature of the software. Only used it a short while. Part of problem is it requires a large amount of RAM & my PC was a little old. Expansion helped but it still took over at times.
2,Symantec Support?,"Symantec in America has successfully shielded themselves from any kind of customer concern by having all service moved off-shore. The phone connection is weak at times. More importantly, there is a regimented, unyielding apporach to your issue. There are lots of ""I'm sorries"" and ""I understand"" but little understanding help. I will never use another Symantec product. If you choose to, I hope you will not require much in the way of support."
1,Norton Internet Security 2006,"I have used Norton for many years with great sucess. This progran is a failure, I have spent three days trying to get this program to work with the internet. Installed and uninstalled over and over again, adjusted the settings over and over again. i just do not have this kind of time. I have tried their support with out any results. Sorry I just dont have time to continue messing around."
1,Doesn't get the job done,"Here's my experience with Norton: It would detect viruses and spyware, but was unable to quarantine or remove them. That made their product useless to me. Later, I downloaded free virus / spyware protection from a different provider over the net. That product not only detected threats, but was also able to zap them. Skip Norton."
1,This program will damage or erase any program you hold dear to you.A virus works better.They are better written than this crap.,"This program is horrible.Symantec doesnt care about you programs or data.They only want your money.Their support is run by idiots who know very little about their crappy products.I lost all my games,and my superfast dell machine is now a planter.your suuppot was useless.You could hire people who have brains,but that would hurt your bottom line.Its been reported you are having a banner year.yeah riping off your customers.A must to avoid,from a kid who knows."
1,Please do not buy this product,"I purchased this product a few days after obtaining a new computer from Alienware. The computer works wonderfully - until I install Norton internet security. At that point, I am unable to access the internet or load Norton. If I attempt to load any aspect of the internet security package the computer freezes and I have to reboot. I can uninstall it without difficulty afterwhich the system once again appears to work well; however, in this day and age keeping the security package uninstalled is certainly not a long-term solution. To top it all off, Norton appears to have minimal if any customer support. Their website features minimal on-line fixes that are much too basic given the numerous poor reviews on this site alone. The only way you can speak to a person (who really doesn't know what he's doing anyway) is by paying them $30. Please buy Macafee . . ."
4,Review: Norton2006,"Okay, I have no real gripes with the product, nor with amazon.com, but I do with Symantec. Those pricks hide behind ""company policy"" when they refuse to ship to a post office box. I don't really give a rat's ass about their ""policy"" (sic), but as the customer I want what I want and that constitutes the end of the subject. Ergo, to hell with 'em, and I got the same thing from right here at amazon.com. A year back I managed to get the little darlings at Norton to send the 2005 version to my post office box after I erupted over the phone (after the wooden head on their end insisted the US Postal Service doesn't deliver to post office boxes). This year I said phooey on it. Ordered the 2006 version here and viola! it appeared scant days later by the magic of Ben Franklin's other innovation, the post."
1,Internet Security,I cannot install it and cannot even remove it from my computer. And I decided to throw it away. How trrible experience it is.
4,PC Protection,I have had no problems with Norton unlike reports I have heard. I will continue to use their product and support when needed.
1,"NIS 2006 unstable, makes XP unstable; installation poor","I advise avoiding this product.It is difficult to install, requiring multiple restarts and manual uninstallation of previous versions and other Norton products. I had never had an Windows XP /SP2 crash or lockup until I installed this, but now I have lots. Even the Norton user interface hangs. The anti-spam isn't smart enought to let mail from addresses in your address book through--although it looks like it should. Also anti-spam has a very high ratio of both false negatives and false positives, even after training. Definitely worse than 2005 version. Spyware still gets through too. There are lots of unnecessary, interrupting annoying messages.Overall, a good product gone bad with incremental additions to muliple peacemeal programs. Needs a total redesign and rewrite. AVOID."
2,Good Software...But,"NIS is a good concept, and works. However, as I found out, there are some things to know first.1. Dont run it w/ less than a 2.5GHz proc, and at least 512mb RAM. Of course, more is prefered.2.Program does take a considerable amount of knowledge, most of which is provided in the documentation. I urge you to read this carefully.3.Norton Antivirus 2006 is the safest alternative. Works just as well on a CLEAN (vuris/mal/spyware) system w/o the headache.I hope this review helps provide you with enough material to make a more knowledgable decision in buying this product."
1,Installation failed - no customer service,"I had a problem installing this product. I tried three times over a two hour period and intallation failed each time. So, I went to the Norton web site to get some help...no 800 number!! The FAQs and knowledge base offered no help or solution either. I guess I can understand making people pay for regular support, however, no help for a new client trying to install their product??? If a company doesn't properly support their product they don't deserve your business. Pass on anything Norton."
2,Needs improvement,"Although Norton Internet Security provides decent coverage of virus protection, firewall, etc. it has one major flaw. It decreases performance of your pc significantly. It is a very fat client and uses a lot of resources. So if you have an older machine to begin with, it will bring it to a screeching halt. Even if you meet or exceed the minimum requirements. It also seems to take control over the whole machine. For example, if you want to disable a feature, like firewall protection, it keeps prompting you that you are in grave danger and that it needs to be fixed. Quite annoying.The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is that it seems to do its job overall and the user interface is fairly intuitive and professional looking. Otherwise, two thumbs down.I have switched to AVG free antivirus. There is also a version you can pay for which gives support and firewall protection. This is a much lighter client software."
1,0 stars! Used to be faithful Norton user - never again!,"I have been a Norton customer for years. I updated to Norton Internet Security 2006 on May 1st. It loaded okay and seemed to be working. However, my computer was slowing down over time. Two days ago, it basically came to a halt, showing 100% cpu usage with windows explorer. I was finally able to uninstall Norton and everything is fine now (no thanks to Norton's customer no-service)!"
1,Take the loss & move on,"Tried to install NIS 2006 after removing an earlier version, kept getting a message about aborting the new installation because ""variants"" of an earlier symantec product were detected.Spent most of the day trying to track down the problem, including 2 sessions with their ""engineers"" who were obviously reading scripted material. Doesn't bother me that they were in India or wherever, they were just clueless - full of heartfelt sympathy, but no help. Downloaded a variety of symantec's ""clean out"" tools,supposedly made to address this very problem, all of which aborted. If you spend 50 bucks on a bad meal in a restaurant, you avoid the place and move on. Same thing here. This is a product that can't get out of its own way, and should be avoided."
1,"Will not install, no technical support","I bought Norton Internet Security 2006 2 weeks ago and it will not install. If you can get it to run install, all you get are error messages and it will abort the installation. A call to the technical support and they hung up before I could ask any questions. Needless to say, I think that it is a buggy program and Norton's technical assistance is non-existent.I would not recommend anyone to buy this product."
3,Very Strong,I use this as a house spray as I am near the woods and sometimes its very very damp so I use this it is very strong and if you have allergy issues might not be right for you...
1,Poor workmanship,"The first one lasted one year and then stopped sticking to the windscreen. Instead of replacing only the suction piece, I had to replace the entire set (because Garmin will not provide pieces only). Spent $50 again and new set broke right where the mount sticks to the suction in less than a month.My new GPS is not going to be Garmin."
5,The new Garmn Quest Suction Cup holder is awesome,The new Garmin Quest Suction Cup holder is awesome. I have now the flexibility to put it everywere not possible with the old one. Definitely it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this device.
2,Still puts the GPS in your lap,"Garmin just can't figure out how to attach one of these things to your car. Only slightly better than the original, it still falls. Don't believe the reviews you may have read, and don't believe that you will EVER hear anything from customer service/product support."
2,Book lacks basic examples!,"IF you want to own a book that looks impresive and does little to help you understand about Powerbuilder, then this is the book for you. There is more usless information in the book then one can create an object class for."
3,"Purist Buys a Pedal, Average Results","For starters, you should know that I am somewhat of a bass purist. I love pure bass tone, straight from the bass guitar through the amplifier. It needs no effects.That said, I bought this pedal thinking I could add some low end to my sound and have some effects to play with. The pedal is fun to mess around with, sure. But, it adds a decidedly electronic sound that has no place in any of the music I play. Not currently at least. If I'm sounding a lot like you, I'd recommend trying it at a music store first. Or just skipping. I believe that the pedal does indeed perform as designed; I just don't care for the results."
3,Not what I expected or hoped for,"Maybe I just had the wrong idea of what this might be able to do, but after buying this pedal I rarely use it, and when I do it's not for the reason I originally intended.I was hoping to get a Strat guitar to sound more like a bass guitar. It just doesn't happen for me. Maybe I'm not setting something correctly, or maybe I need a better amp or speaker, but the dropped-octave effect leaves a lot to be desired. It ends up thin and wobbly.You can get other interesting and potentially useful sounds out of this, and the chorusy/doubling effect is quite good. It also does a nice job with serious distortion. But if you're considering getting this try to use one first so you know its limitations."
3,Odd and dark but interesting,"A Desperate Game is an engrossing read, but Reave is often emotionally cruel to Tessa. She wows the staff immediately but there's no reason given. She is also sometimes cruel back to Reave.The mystery is interesting, as is the historical ambiance, but the emotional abuse lowers it drastically in my book.Unfortunately, it's been a while since I read the book, so I'm giving it an average 3 stars."
4,Historical Romance Novel with dash of mystery,A Desperate Game by Barbara Pierce was a tangled mystery. Tessa runs away from her abusive husband who ends up dead. She get accused of his murder but she is hiding out under a false name. She finds herself working for a Reave Alden a broken harden Earl who is also working a prosecutor for the Crown.
3,Ok - Standard,"Reave Alden spends the first half of the story being boorish and rude. I had trouble getting past this especially when he didn't improve much. He just went on to arrogant and demanding. Tessa swung from pale and weak, to snapping shrew. How she thought she could marry an Earl and not be recognized, I don't understand. All in all, neither character was very engaging. The story was flat and meandering. The most interesting aspect was the character of Lord Kim Farrell. At least he had some personality. He was also more of a hero than Reave, by helping Tessa when he could have taken advantage of her.As a whole, the book is ""fair"". The mystery is at least interesting almost to the very end. Likeable but forgettable."
3,Mixed feelings,"This book has a lot of good information in it.The two problems with the book are that with the exception of the hike, Escalante South, the rest of the loops cross well-used roads. What is the point of carrying a pack for a week while crossing well-used roads, especially if the author fails to explain that nearly all points on the loop can easily be reached by dayhikes?A second dislike is that the author also takes you some less interesting sections of some canyons in expense of some of the really great sections of the same canyon or nearby ones.If you want to use this book to it's fullest potential, make sure to get off the paint-by-numbers route and explore some on your own. Make sure to go over the maps and realize that the areas in the book don't usually get that far from the roads."
2,Hardware is NB to run this game,"Was given this game by my wife (the first and last time she has ever bought me a game) and was extremely disappointed that I could not run it on my system because my graphics card does not handle texturing and shading.I am running a top of the range laptop system, and even with a P4 1.8 with 512meg DDR, 64 meg graphics adaptor - I still could not run the graphics.Be warned! This game will only run if your graphics card handles T&S.Apart from that problem, I am glad I got to change the game for another, as the reviews I have read on the gameplay are not good at all. I ended up getting Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind which is the best game I have ever had.Skip this one, and move onto Morrowind, and say goodbye to your real life!"
3,"Works great for 20 bucks, However.........","Works great for 20 bucks. However, the heads that come with it don't stay on by themselves. You have to hold them in place. For the aggrivation if you have something large to fill up, I would recommend spending a few more bucks. If this doesn't bother you then it's a great buy and even though it's a pain it's worth the 20 bucks!"
2,"Not ""Giant"" Garden Chess Set","The photo for this chess set is very misleading. I thought it would really be large pieces to be able to move around with ease. However the pieces are small, 6"" to 8"". The material is hard plastic which is fine and would be durable."
2,King came with broken symbol on top - no loose piece to even glue on.,One of the Kings came with broken symbol on top - there was no loose piece to even glue back on.
4,Kids Absolutely Love This Chess Set....,"This chess set is wonderful, it has inspired at least two children who have been to our home to learn how to play chess.My own children love playing with this set. In addition to playing chess, sometimes they recreate the Fritz and Chesster games they've played and printed from the computer, sometimes they make up puzzles for each other ""Move one piece and put my king into check"", sometimes they haul the chess pieces around the house to do double duty for some other imaginative play venture.I do wish there was some way to weight the pieces, they are hollow plastic with felt bottoms. I've debated opening them up to put sand inside of them, but haven't done so yet. Anyway, I'm not sure how this game would hold up outside on a windy day, but regardless, we have been very pleased with this chess set."
1,Not worth the money,"I wished I hadn't bought this set. The pieces aren't weighted and very lightweight, the mat is hard to get flat (take out all the wrinkles) and playing in the wind is impossible. Don't waste your money. Get a real chess set (especially with double or triple weighted pieces) and set it up on a table. You'll be much happier."
5,Problems fixed?,"Although almost all reviews rated this product highly, I had to wonder about the two negative comments I saw: one, that the pieces are too light, and two, that some broke in shipment (even though that problem was promptly and professionally remedied).The pieces I received didn't seem to be too extremely light to me, and definitely have more weight towards the base, so they may have been changed in response to that issue. Also, the pieces were individually wrapped, as well as being in larger bags for each color. My pieces all arrived in fine shape, and I suspect the individual wrapping may have been to address the breakage issue.The board has 4"" squares, giving a 32"" square playing area, with the ranks and files for algebraic chess notation around the border. The bases of the king and queen actually go out to the edge of their squares, and I think if someone wanted to make a board with 5"" squares (for a 40"" square playing area), these pieces would seem quite natural on it."
5,Much bigger than I expected!,"I wasn't expecting this chess set to be as large as it is. I am very happy with the size. This was a gift for my husband, who is a chess fan, and he loves it. It's also an easy board that is good for teaching someone how to play, which is what my husband intends to do with me. Great value for the price!"
2,"Good for beginners, maybe","This book is not at all helpful if you already know how to read music and carry a basic tune. It might be helpful to someone who's never tried to read music or sing before, but not me (I have 11 yrs. instrumental music experience). I guess I'm going to have to fork out $$$ for professional lessons!!"
3,Well...,"This book gets three stars. It's okay. If you are totally new to Paint Shop Pro, this book is for you. For those that know a good amount or are masters, don't bother.First of all, it's almost exactly like the Teach Yourself Paint Shop pro 5.0 in 24 hours. The only thing is added is the few new features in 6.0. Even the tutors are the same...same wording, same everything. If you have 5.0 book, don't bother getting this book.Second, it reads like the manuel. Why pay 20 bucks for a book you already have?Third, don't believe the 24 hour thing. Usually there is about two or three tutors per one hour session...but trust me, it takes more practice and more tutors with some applications such as layers and masks.On a good note, it does teach you some techniques and also gives you information on PSP's tools. You also get information on basic web design with a lot of common web design questions answered."
3,Just ok,"I was looking for a children's book about shoes & this does fit the bill. Not much imagination. Story is boring. Illustrations are colorful & cute, but it this book just doesn't have anything that ""grabs"" your attention or imagination."
5,No Worries with this watch.,"Well, i can't say enough about this watch. For 20Years, I have never made it past 2 years on a watch. This watch came with a 5yr warranty and guess what...its been 5 flawless years and still going.. while it cost a bit more that your Timex or Casio....SO WORTH IT....Only Complaint: I kinda liked getting a new watch every 2 years. So if you want a watch that lasts...GET A CITIZEN.... IM SOLD ON THEM.."
5,Experiential Learning,"This book is fantastic. It helps explain in detail the Why, What, How, and What if... If you are a leader and want to communicate better in presentations, negotiations, and team meetings. It is a great book on how people experience the world and internalise it. Another great read that uses examples to explain the theory is 'The Art of Changing the Brain' by J. Zull."
4,An teaching must-have,"although occasionally overly complex, the core ideas of experiential learning are easily understood and implemented. kolb's theories and ideas match up smoothly to real life. i would submit that most teachers already use experiential learning, and those that don't are missing out. read it, try it, reflect on it, and then you will understand... but i'm paraphrasing.stu"
2,Wilton Pan RUSTS!!!!!,"Bought this pan for my mother, the cheesecaker maker! She loved the size and used it often. After the second year, the pan is rusting! She cannot use it, now! So beware......."
2,Ok,Bought this book impulsively hoping it would have saying of shankara but in actuality it had only interpretations of interpretations. eh
1,Terrible prose made worse only by awful content,"The book contains about 20 chapters, they all follow the form of mildly interesting but wholly unsupported first paragraph followed by a couple pages of the exact same paragraph rephrased a hundred different ways. The introduction makes the laughable claim that Shankara takes a ""scientific"" approach. Perhaps if science consisted of making absurd claims and hurling insults at those who disagree our faithful translator Prabhavananda would have been right, fortunately however he was lying. This book is boring and has nothing useful to say, truly only the simple minded could find anything to appreciate between its covers."
4,A must for those on the spiritual path,"Shankara's Vivek Chudamani is a classic text orignally written in Sanskrit and is a must of anyone on the spiritual pathway to enlightenment (Hindu/Buddhist pathways). It makes you take a hard look at your beliefs and practices, social norms and customs and helps you separate the wheat from the chaff. Swami Prabhavananda and Christoper Isherwood have done an excellent job of translating it into English. The translation is easy to read, although the material is by no means a light read and is meant for someone who is serious about the pathway. It is a great book to read again and again as your awareness grows."
5,Non-Duality Teaching of Shankara,"The Crest Jewel of Discrimination teaches about Atman and Brahman, and how they are the true existence. Everything else is illusion. Atman and Brahman are a state of non-duality, which means that our physical existence is not real. It is the equivalent of a dream. Our life purpose is to realize the Atman, the Self.The teachings of Advaita Vedanta are meant for everyone. Even though Shankara was a Hindu philosopher, this is applicable in every religion. A Course in Miracles teaches non-duality as well."
3,Wasn't that bad.. wasn't that good either...,"I am a 15 year old Pagan, (I am not a Wiccan). This book was a ""cute"" story about 5 Witch teens solving a ""murder"" mystery. I do admit that it didn't have the best plot, or best writing, and Silver could have done much better; but I found it to be entertaining and I believe that many young adults would enjoy it. I do believe that Ravenwolf could have portrayed Paganism in a more accurate fashion. The spell at the beginning of the book has a lot of the old stereotypes about making it ""spooky"" also the main character owns a black cat and her last name is Salem. Yes, many people own black cats and have this last name, but this is a book and these traits are there on purpose. I would recommend this book to someone if they wanted a ""fling"" or just something to do, but I wouldn't give it to them if they wanted to know about Witchcraft."
2,If only...,"I have been looking for an author to replace my favorite - L.J. Smith. I picked this one up because I have read through one of Ravenwolf's books and thought it was quite decent. It, however, was nonfiction and this is fiction. There are errors as others have pointed out and it seems to have skipped the good old fashioned workshop phase. I believe it would have greatly improved the writing. There was a storyline here. I just feel that it fell short of what it could have been...I suggest the relatively new (?) talent of Isobel Bird and her series Circle of Three."
1,She is trying TOO hard...,"Okay. I think Silver has tried too hard. Her books, like ""To Stir A Magick Cauldron"", ""To Ride A silver Broomstick,"" and ""To Light A Sacred Flame"", were okay, but her lessons dropped when ""Teen Witch"" came around. I think her ways of wicca are just teaching teens how ""popular"" witchcraft is, and I don't think she takes Wicca as seriously as she says she does. This book, ""witches Night Out"", is nothing more than more of her ""popular"" nonsense that she insists on brining out. This book has nothing but the popular sides of Wicca, and it isn't only the negative-vibe, its also the fact that this book tries too hard to warm your hearts and ends up confusing you. It is a waist of time and I dont recomend this book at all."
4,not just for teens,"This is Silver's newest work-- her idea for writing this series was taken from her Wicca 101 book for Teens. Bethany Salem is the main character-- she also seems to be the acting HPs of her coven of high school teens. The plot is based around her knowledge that her boyfriend's death wasn't an accident... but she doesn't know who is responsible.The book deals with typical and not so typical teenage problems. Bethany and her friends have to deal with the irrational fears of their classmates, even teachers who provoke students because of their lack of knowledge. And of course, there's the scary ""step-mother to be"" who's up to a lot more than meets the eye."
3,read it to form your own opinion.,"I have to admit i only bought this book because of the 'harsh' reviews it got, not because I was drawn to the story.First of all, I like the reason why Silver wrote this book, to make the teens on the cover of ""teen witch"" come alive as 'real teen witches'. I do feel she should make the storyline more realistic: I don't like the fact I could summon the hounds of hell with a ritual!The book itself is a nice read and comes across as interesting and amusing but not to be experienced as true wicca by teenagers.Right now I am halfway through the book and I am really hoping that by the end of it the girls learn a few lessons about acting on revenge.Do read it to make up your own mind about it!"
4,I thought it was good!,"As a person in my mid-twenties, I have recently beome interested in wicca and witchcraft. As a result, I have read just about anything I can get my hands on. I really liked this book. Some of the reviews have been negative, but I think that some people need to relax. It is fiction, after all. The characters may not have followed the Wiccan Rede, but sometimes in life, people don't always do what they are supposed to do. In short, I enjoyed the book, and I think that most people would too."
2,Witches Night Out,"How do I love Silver Ravenwolf as a writer? Let me count the ways, but this is not one of them. Silver should stick to what she knows. This book lacked depth and plot. Her book beneath a Mountain Moon should be caterogized in the same manner, after 60 pages or so, I had to put it down; I just lost interest. However, her how to books on Wicca for adults and teens alike are exceptional. Her Teen Kit for witches is fantastic, I just wish there was one for adults. I also wish she would write an autobiography of her life and how she became a witch--these are the things that Silver is best at--not fiction. L.J. Smith is the author to read for young adult fiction, it has intrigue, suspsense mystery all rolled into one. Silver Ravenwolf is a teacher--the best when it comes to the Craft, but as far as writing fiction--she should leave that to someone else and write what she knows!"
2,Somewhere on the way to the bank...,"Somewhere on the way to the bank, Silver has forgotten that Wicca is a Religion. She places much, too much emphasis on Spells and little on Religion.I am very concerned that the Coven in this book decided to call upon the Wild Hunt. Never in my wildest dreams would I ever consider calling upon the Wild Hunt. I think that Silver has had a serious lapse in judgement putting this into the story. I am sure that a few unsuspecting teens will attempt the same.If I was a 15 year old (I'm 38) and not Pagan, I would have probably loved the book. I read the book to see if I would want my 12 year old daughter to read it. I think I'll wait a few more years. I don't need her to get Silver's slightly distorted belief that the answer to every little problem in your life is to do a spell!"
5,A book by a witch about a witch for witches :),"Some of the reviews for this book put it down but I for one really enjoyed it. I'm a 16 year old wiccan from england so I could associate both with the problems they had to deal with as teenagers and the wiccan side of it- sadly, especially the attitudes of ignorant people. Some have said that this book is aimed at young adults who are not wiccan as a horror novel, but I don't think this is the case. For wiccans my age who rarely ever find other wiccans of the same age it was nice to read about something we could relate to as wiccans even though it was based around them searching for the killer of one of their coven which thankfuly most of us have not expereinced. I think a mention of the rede would have been nice though."
2,Too mild,"You can't help but love a good Yankee Candle. Well ... this ""Jack Frost"" is so mild that you've got to try pretty hard to love it. Its fragrance doesn't permeate the air as one would like of this priced candle. It's terrific peppermint smell just doesn't make it past the glow of the wick. Perhaps I'm too harsh with this candle, but I've used other Yankee peppermint based candles and could smell them quite well in the house. ... just sayin' ... It seems as though I've bought a $25 unscented candle to burn."
2,Can't really get into these guys...,"Although I admire their work ethic and their will to succeed, especially coming out of a Communist Eastern European country like Poland, these guys never really did grow on me after repeated listens. The problem with this album is that it sounds rushed and thrown together. Also, many of the tracks are way too short. I particularily don't like this album because there is just too much Slayer and Morbid angel influence for me to stomach (I never could get into those bands either). On the other hand, there are some positive aspects about this band, and those are as follows.1.) The drumming. Doc is one of the best Grindcore drummers out there who has perfected the art of blastbeats.2.) ""The final massacre"" is a very cool song.Well, that's it. I wish Vader the best of luck but I just can't pretend to take an interest in them."
3,Whats the big deal?,"Yeah, yeah, I know, I should be loving this band, as it combines European style death metal with New York style death metal with a touch of brutality, but there is something that just doesnt click for me. It may be Peter's lame growls, or the lack of tight riffs, but I just cant seem to get into this band. I can see why people like this band, but like Behemoths new album, it ends up being an overhyped, overrated, and boring ideal.I gave this 1 star for Vader being one of the first bands out of the Soviet Union, 1 star for Doc being an amazing drummer, and 1 star for not being metalcore.Overall, I suggest Immolation and fellow Poles Decapitated over this."
3,The suitcase kid,"I think its a good story but somtimes a bit boring and i like the way the chapters are labeled with A,B,C and on it only got good when chapter C came along but the rest was realy good and it was funny to. The best bit for me was when she finds out about the Peters it was realy nice at that bit and i think katie was quite meanso i rated it 3 stars out of 5"
3,didn't really need this,"It's good to have extra accessories, I guess. Amazon told me to buy this when I bought the coffee maker... but i really don't need it. And the frothing stick kind of stinks, sadly. You have to hold the button... no on/off switch."
1,cheaply made and potentially dangerous,The accessories are about the same quality as the coffeemaker - made in China and apparently not very durable. The milk frother in particular seemed to be very cheaply made.
5,Bugs I LOVE to have around the house!,"These bugs are God's life lessons being poured out in a wonderful, bright and memorable way. Must have for all ages!"
3,Okay game,"I don't play the signle player missions for this game so I can't tell you if it is a good signle play mission game or not. The only diffrence between Team Sabre and the regular Black Hawk Down game is that in Team Sabre there are new weapons and skins and maps. Online the game is better, it still has that invisible sniper problem but the lounge is much better. The awards are more detailed with better pictures of it. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to try new weapons to Blawk Hawk Down or wants new signle player Missions."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I have tried nine times in a row to get this thing to install correctly. Once again, Novalogic makes it impossible to just click and install. Graphics? Don't know! Sound? No idea! I'm a huge fan of the series. I have purchased every single Delta Force game they've made. But come on! I have typed in this insidiously stupid product code nine times! Nine times! I even had to type it in again to register it, because the programmers were too lazy to build a copy/paste into the carry-over screen. I'm an 8 year veteran of the real special forces. I don't think my training was this hard. (Just kidding on that last one: It was much harder.) Please, customer service of Novalogic, please return my e-mails to tell me what I'm doing wrong."
1,wont load,"Bought this to play, well its been 2 weeks & it wont load,, I should have known, I have all major shooter games from Max Payne to all MOH. Support doesn't help.O well thats really the last time i purchase a second rate software company product. Looks like i'll wait for battlefield vietnam & MOH pearl harbor. I'll use this CD ROM as a mirror. Novalogic, your amateurs, get a real job !"
3,"Great coffee, built to break","This coffee maker (used also by the Soprano's) makes great coffee, the carafe keeps it hot but doesn't burn it. However, the button that opens the ""swing away"" filter basket seems to be built to break. We have gone through two of these. The last one lasted just over a year."
2,Not good for ameuters,"This book is great if you already know how to draw manga but need to know how to illustrate battle scenes. Me, having only drawn manga for a year didn't find this book very helpful. If I was more experiened I'm sure this book would have been a lot more handy. Don't get this book unless you already know how to draw manga."
5,Great,"This book is so good at showing you the art of battle. Of course it is hard to rely on this book alone, you should start on the basics but this book definatly helped me to heighten the fun of my manga."
5,Very Useful,"This book is for more advanced artists wishing to expand their skills to fight scenes. It shows both battle technique of various styles and the resulting injuries given. It is particularly useful in that it doesn't hold one's hand, but just give guidelines and examples."
4,A great book for the advanced manga drawer,"This is by no means a beginners book. You'll want to start with the ""Compiling Characters"" book to start. By the time you have the basic techniques down, then this book will help. The four star rating is a bit misleading, let me tell you why. The art in the book is great. It does a great job in showing you how to make fight scenes look dynamic. How different styles of hitting are used in comedic and hard-boiled action. But as si the problem with earlier translated versions, sometimes the language comes off as stiff. It reads as if you're listening to a stereotype Japanese speaking ""engrish"". As a result sometimes the descriptions aren't as good as the should be. Other than that this is another great book to add to your ""How to Draw"" collection."
3,A useful book on drawing those fight scenes.,"Maybe I'm a bit biased but I don't really draw a lot of fight scenes. However having this book I do know it instructs about all forms of battle scenes and about how the characters respond to attacks from an opponent (all things that make the drawing more believable). There is a section on doing the ever-popular ""Seifuku"" (Japanese school uniform) battles (the key is in the movement of the skirt). I still recommend this book, particular for people who want to draw lots of battle scenes."
5,I'm an animation nut,I think this book would prove useful for flash animators. If you want to animate some cool fight sequences this book will provide a good reference. The art being fresh and inspiring to artists and animators a like enjoy.
1,Do not get this book,"I repeat: you do not want to get this book. I ordered it for a friend for christmas and I looked over it before I wrapped it. And boy, was I glad I did! This book has vile, obscene, and had highly unappropriate content. I was hideously disgusted and was so ashamed I picked the book in the first place- I walked to the trash can and put it in. A complete waste of money and I had to go to the store that night to find a last minute replacement book. If you want a book, I would highly recommend the book How to Draw Manga, All The Basics. That was the book I got for my other friend, and it was very impressive. At the risk of sounding redundant, I say: Unless you want to burn money- DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
2,Painful For Adults -- But Kids Seem to Like It.,"As a parent/reader, I couldn't agree more with the other reviewer. Molly and Emmett stories are absolutely painful to read. Dull, pointless and witless. But -- and this is key -- from the 100-plus books in my daughter's library she grabs her Molly and Emmett books probably more than any others. So, I'm rolling with it. There must be some appeal for kids here that defies adult logic and instinct. If anyone knows what it is, I'd love to hear it! She can't grow out of these books fast enough for me, however."
4,thorough,"My friends and I worked the this Hebrews Bible study and foung it to be very thorough and thought provoking. When we first read through some of the questions, we thought they sounded a little ridiculous. We decided to do them anyway, and found that those were the questions that taught us the most. This book presents a nice balance of historical facts and current life applications. Reapsome delves deep into the book, and helps us understand what we personally need to take from Hebrews to be better children of God."
2,Earbuds Not Designed for Ears,"I was interested in these primarily for listening to music with my KRZR K1M. Problem is, they're designed as a series of shapes (circle, cylinder, etc.) with little thought given to whether they'll stay in the ears. An alternate product is Moto's headphone adapter SYN1503), which provides a 3.5mm jack that you can use with the earbuds of your choice. For me, that worked a lot better, though I lost the ability to answer calls with the earbuds in place."
1,I wouldn't touch the stuff,"I'm amazed at how many people really dont read the labels and could care less about what they are putting on their skin. I guess as long as the price is right and the packaging and scent look good, it really doesn't matter. Almost all of the Canus products contain toxic chemicals, but you are led to believe they are ""natural"" and gentle on your skin. I would much rather wear a goats milk lotion, or ANY type of lotion for that matter that has none of these toxic chemicals or preservatives added. They use them because they are cheap to manufacture, not because they actually CARE about what it does for you. I prefer the natural bath. [...]"
5,I love this book!,I got this book for Christmas and have used it many times already. Everything I have tried has been tasty but my favorites are fettucine alfredo and the ceasar salad. This is not a book for anyone looking to cut all fat from their diet but for someone who wants to reduce fat without sacrificing any flavor. I highly recommend it!
5,"Quick, tasty, and low calorie","This is the cookbook for you if you like it easy, but good for your waistline. No one ever believes these dishes are from a ""diet"" cookbook."
2,not so much of a good mexican film,"This movie is divided in 3 different stories that don't quite make sense of what the tittle suppose to be. The first 2 episodes are in black and white and the last one is on full color that they all took place back in the early 1900s. This is not a movie you want to own. The whole plot of the movie is quite boring.The only thing that I can say about this film is that I finally get to see the full naked rear side of one of my favorite Mexican actress, Ana Claudia Talancon, but that is all I can say I found interesting on this film. If you want to buy interesting Mexican films, buy ""El Tigre de Santa Julia"" or ""Matando Cabos"" or if you are a fan of Ana Claudia Talancon, buy ""Ladies Night"" and ""Love in the time of Cholera"". Not this one."
2,Why bother?,"If you are a listener of music, this book will not help you 'hear' the music of Carter. It will help you understand it. In effect, harmony in Carter's music, exploiting the full chromatic spectrum as it does, frees his poly-rhythmic structures and intricate counterpoint to function independently of harmony. In my opinion, the harmony in Carter's music is its weakest aspect. I don't really hear it in his music. What I found interesting in this book was seeing how Carter's use of harmony enables his long term poly-rhythmic structures to work, which in themselves are quite fascinating. But the lack of the sense of 'vertical' in his music makes the actual study of his harmony a moot point for this listener."
2,Lukewarm Coffee,"Does not get coffee very hot. All water drips down the center of the grinds, unless a lot of coffee is used it makes it weak. Good looking unit."
2,not that good,"This machine looks great but if you take milk with your coffee then it is cold and has to be heated in the microwave, the lid on the top of the machine where the coffee goes does not close tight and the lid on the carafe is so hard to get off and then the seal inside the lid moves so i just rinse it out.not that good...."
1,Not So Good Coffee Maker,It was hard to clean and use. I ended up throwing it away after one week. Hated it...
5,A great coffee maker even after 4 years of use!,"In defense of this product, I want to say that after 4 years of daily use, I still love it and it still provides a good cup of coffee! I have to agree that in the first few weeks I did have problems getting the lid off and on but either my method improved or it loosened up. Now it is a breeze to get off and on, even at 5 something in the morning. The car adaptor/cup holder works well in my car and the long commute is not as horrible with that huge cup of coffee on board! I have never had any problems with it dribbling coffee as some have had. Is it the best cup of coffee ever? Well, I still do enjoy stopping by Starbucks and Caribou on occasion but only because my coffee pot doesn't make lattes!"
2,Makes Great Coffee - Has Great Flaws,"Within the first week of use a plastic ring cracked inside the cap that slides onto the top of the stainless container. Now you must adjust the loose gasket around that cracked plastic ring in order to get the top to slide correctly onto the container. That wasn't the only thing to go wrong with this would be great coffee maker. A plastic sleeve that shuts off the coffee flow so that you can sneak a cup while it's brewing keeps popping out of it's plastic holder. The coffee is superb, but the trouble you have to go through is not worth it. I will be sending it back."
2,A great idea but unfortunately flawed,"We wanted a 4-cup coffeemaker that would have a thermal pot and this is the only one we found. This pot is also meant to be used in the car as a thermal cup -- sounds good. But in making a tight seal for traveling, the pot lid is REALLY difficult to remove. I had a hard time taking off the lid when the pot was empty -- if it had any coffee left in it it probably would have gone flying when I finally tore it off. Why didn't they make a screw on lid like most thermal pots? Anyway, it is a pain to work with when you have to open and wash it everyday, and since we don't use it for the car, it wasn't worth the work."
5,Love these Lellis!,Great shoes! Can be dressy shoes to wear with dresses and skirts or as sneakers to run around with in the playground. With or without tights and socks. My 6 year old daughter says they're very comfy. I ordered a half size bigger thinking they would last on my daughter a little longer but they fit just right. Guess the sizes run a little small? A bit pricey but worth it. I would definitely buy these shoes again.
2,still waiting to return,"i am still waiting to return this item becase their computer system is unable to print me a returns note, which was not enclosed with the product, and the link to print myself bought from amazon does not work eitherthe product is very good just too big for my daughter"
2,pretty pictures...,"I am always looking for good Filipino cookbooks. I was delighted to find this while I was browsing until...I looked through the book. It has pretty pictures, it definitely made me think of the Philippines. But I was hoping for a more substantial cookbook, one with more recipes, one I can actually use as a cookbook. This is more of a coffee table book, made to tantalize and not quite functional. It has pretty pictures..."
4,Getting kick started.,"This book is all about knowledge. The more you understand about the effects of good healthy habits, the easier it is to get started. After reading this book, it gave me the encouragement to figure out how to incorporate the 7 healthy ""things"" into my life even though I have severe arthritis. Reading this, lead me to investigate how I can better manage my arthritis - and incorporate excercises into my day I never thought I'd be able to do again."
5,The journey,"I enjoyed this book because first off I know the writer, and my dad is his best friend. I also enjoyed the book because each indian tribe has it's own process of turning a boy into a man and this book had a diffrent way of going about that."
5,Magical! Fantastic!,"What a CD! The songs are pop songs--verse, chorus, verse, almost no solos--with simple, direct melodies and lyrics and a wonderful sense of playfulness. ""Loss"" reminds me a bit of late 60's Beach Boys (e.g. Smiley Smile & Friends) with Colin as Brian. A more modern comparison might be Coldplay (though MHS is less dour, especially on this CD). Check out the opening track (Public Service Announcement), one of the British hits (Barcode Bypass, Watching Xanadu, Animal Cannabus), or try my favorie--Paper Houses."
4,I wonder If...,"I do have this in vinyl.But I always think about it in terms of: when will I be able to have the five hours to hear it complete?..I do get a very nice feeling every time i got the first plate completed. I remain on what i've heard.But I always wonder if this is merely, an ""artistic"" perfomance rather than a musical one.I hope you people understand my doubts between those.I allways believed that things must have a reason behind such a lenght.Sincerely, I will not dare to say anything else until I will do hear this piece alltogether and at once.Meanwhile I do read carefully others opinion."
1,Christian or not?,"I gave this book one star since the system will not allow me to give zero stars.Mr. Crossan is a Christian Liberal who as a core part of his theology removes the divinity of Christ, reduces Jesus to the role of mere mortal.Most Christian Liberals also apply evolution to the Bible.None of this makes them Christian.I DO NOT in any way recommend this book. For true Christians, they will find it easy to throw this book at a wall than to read it."
5,Depth Of Research Is Impressive,Each chapter deals with a provocative topic worthy of a separate book. A good example is the chapter on the execution of Jesus. The authors propose that Jesus was arrested during the Passover festival by the Romans as a result of a disturbance in the Temple. He was then summarily crucified and probably was not buried but instead left as food for birds of prey and wild dogs. The theory is certainly not original but the depth of research behind it is impressive. The rest of the book seems to meet this same high standard.
5,Thought provoking book,"After reading reviews of several of Crossan's books, I decided to start with this one, since I wasn't sure of my ability to plow through a complicated, highly scholarly text. Now that I've read it, I want to read more.At several points in my reading of this book (which I had trouble putting down) I found myself saying ""Yes, I agree"" or ""I don't like that he says that."" He explains his personal beliefs and the cultural, literary, and historical evidence that led him to those beliefs in a way that does not offend me, even when I disagree.My spouse is reading it now, and I look forward to lively discussions. The book is full of food for thought."
5,All you ever wanted to know about Jesus but were afraid to ask...,"John Dominic Crossan's incredibly accessible book succinctly sums up his views of the Historical Jesus in question and answer form. For those who find Crossan's other seminal works on the Historical Jesus just a bit too heavy and erudite to get through, this is the answer to their prayers. It provides all of Crossan's historical conclusions without asking the reader to verse themselves in Crossan's complex scientific method (they can read ""The Historical Jesus"" and ""Jesus, A Revolutionary Biography"" for that.) If you are looking for an easy intro into Crossan's take on the historical Jesus, this will whet your whistle. It's the beginnning of a wonderful journey that might make you question your beliefs, but may in the end renew your faith in a way you never thought possible. It did for me."
4,Wonderfully encouraging!,"This book has been SO useful as I have the opportunity to minister to women who have believed lies about themselves for their entire lives. Somethings I myself needed to be reminded of! Within the first few pages I could recognize the passion Ms. White has to share TRUTH over deception with anyone who has an inaccurate perception of who God has called them to be. It's for that reason that I would recommend this book. If you need encouragement or need to be empowered to defeat the lies you've made up about yourself or someone else has,(i.e. ""I won't do anything great in life"", ""I don't deserve good things."", ""I'm not special to God."" this is a great book for you! Even the most seemingly confident women could use this as a reminder of who GOD has called them to be and NOT who the WORLD says they should be!"
1,Didn't like at all,This was a boring book that did not tell me anything I didn't already know. I recycled the book after I read it because it was so useless.
2,It;s too small!!!,"What pans are going to fit in this thing? Doll house kitchen equipment?The shallow pan looks like it could hold a cup and a half of stuff.Must I do Casseroles in loaf pans? (loaf pans look doubtful too with the size of this thing.) Dinner could take hours to cook for three people. Well, I guess we will eat in shifts."
4,Delonghi Oven Review,"This is a terrific product. It looks great and performs very well. I have used the rotisserie with great success for turkey and roasts of all kinds. I am also using the 'keep warm' feature to keep plates hot while I finish one last thing before I get the whole meal on the table. Lastly, it is so great for holidays because you can bake a pie or other side and keep your regular oven working on the bird. It heats up quickly and is very easy to use."
1,Delonghi AD1099,"There is not enough room here to describe the problems with this piece of junk! Beware. I just wasted $387.00 and no one will help. Stop on door closes to 3"" instead of 3/4"", outside of oven gets as hot as the inside, minus button for temp and time does not work and the crumb tray is impossible to remove for cleaning. The energy rating for this oven has to be approaching zero."
3,Pretty and realistic but falls apart easily,"This is a good idea and they work great (so far). However, when delivered one of the candles was missing the bottom cover and the electronics were hanging out.I requested a replacement set from amazon which they sent(overnight!) and the new set also had one candle that the bottom came off and the electronics again were hanging out.So, I was at least able to keep the two good candles and return the two bad."
3,Good everyday scent,"It's so hard to judge perfume, you really need to be able to test it out on your own skin before you know if it's a keeper... I appreciate a light, pretty scent. Not too sweet but not too musky. I'm in Florida and when it's hot (always) you want to keep things light & fresh.The first day I wore this, I got several compliments... which makes you wonder, did I put on too much? One woman ran after me into Target to tell me I smelled ""wonderful"". It's a little bit girly, but layered with body lotion it seems to mellow. It lasts a long time also, rare for a low end perfume.I decided to embrace the girly-pinkness. It's nice to change things up. The price is amazing too. I would probably get it again.The bottle is annoying. The pink foo-foo topper just gets in the way. The nozzle is all one color so it's hard to tell where the hole is. I lined it up on the first ""B"" so I won't blind myself on hectic mornings..."
4,Purfume purchase,I bought this perfume combo for my daughter. I thought it came with lotion but it was body wash.Good value for the price.
5,Love it!,I wish that I had discovered this fragrance a long time ago. It is sweet and feminine with a hint of sophistication.
5,Amazing perfume,I've been using this same perfume for 3 years now. I love it. It can be strong at times but it has a very nice scent to it. I love that it's also very affordable. I read they stopped making it which is upsetting.
5,I absolutely love it!,"smells great. I absolutely love this perfume, I wear this perfume everyday. it does not stay longer than I expected but! it's worth it to buy. I never smell this kind of perfume I love it so much!"
5,Can't expect less from Betsey Johnson,"Betsey Johnson is my favorite designer, so of course I had to try her perfume. I've been using this for a year now, and it's a great scent. I'm not really sure how long it lasts, but I feel like it lasts awhile, and my boyfriend always says I smell good. Of course, I don't know if his fondness for my scent is a result of this perfume or my good hygiene, or maybe a swell combination. Either way, the perfume bottle is adorable, and I enjoy the smell when I first spritz it."
4,Fun and fruity,"This is a flirty perfume with citrus top notes and musky vanilla undertones. It's very different from the perfumes I usually wear in that it is fruity and has a very youthful, fun fragrance, but I like it...and of course the packaging is to die for! However, for some reason, a one ounce bottle costs almost $80 in department stores, but it looks like you can buy it a lot cheaper on Amazon, which is what I suggest doing."
1,WRONG CABLE SENT - This is Cat5 not Cat5e,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, this is a CAT5 cable, NOT a CAT5e. Granted for most people that speed is fine. Amazon needs to change the description or fix what they're sending out."
1,This is a Category 5 cable only (not Category 5e),The description is incorrect. This cable is only rated up to 100 Mbits/s (Category 5).
1,"Warning: CAT5, not 5E","The cable arrived on time and in good condition, but it is not a CAT 5E cable as advertised. It is only a CAT 5 Cable."
5,Does it's job,"It's a 25 foot cable. It does it's job really well, have it hooked to my wireless router for X-Box Live. Fast and solid connection. No complaints :)"
4,It's most important message...,"I will leave the details of the book to other reviewers who took the time to describe it very well. But, as a student of Irish, I want to add one very important message I took away from this book. Mr. Fallon points out that it is the Irish spoken in the Gaeltacht that is most at risk of becoming bastardized by losing it's colloquialism's. As an ancient language Irish is based upon a very poetic use of colloquialism that is being lost, as it is becoming more and more a direct translation from English."
2,Disappointing overall,"I had been unimpressed with the computer disks enclosed in earlier editions of several publisher's drug books, but I had liked the Delmar PDR handbook in '98. It seemed worth a chance that this CD edition would be closer to what I needed to make customized medication information printouts for my patients. It was closer, but not by much. The program is ok, but the number of drugs covered is very limited and the whole thing is evidently for the nursing student rather than working professionals."
2,Very different from English manufactured dinnerware,I did not realize how different the Bangladesh manufactured dinnerware is from the English manufactured product. It does not match my previously owned dinnerware.
4,William's poetry comes to life,"If you enjoyed William's Oneal's Portch, this is a definate extension of that concept. Grooving beats and great solos from the quartet with an added treat of Leena Conquest vocalizing Mr. Parker's wonderful poetry. She has a wonderful voice. There's humor, hope, dedication, just damn great modern jazz!I have to say that I somewhat hesitant in buying the CD. I'd listen to another CD by Mr. Parker with vocalist but they just didn't hit the mark."
3,"A nice coffee maker, with ONE Serious ProblemW","We bought a Delonghi DC51TT because we wanted a small coffee maker that drew little power and could be run through a 12 volt DC to 110 Volt AC invertor on our boat. The DeLonghi draws just 550 watts and does not have a hot plate, when it is done brewing it cuts off completely. But the lid on the carafe does not screw in, it is held in by a silicon rubber band that fits very very tightly. My 65 year old arthritic hands could not pull the lid off the carafe, or get it back on properly. When I tried to twist the lid, the silicon rubber band broke, rendering the carafe useless. DeLonghi's customer service was very responsive and sent me a new carafe but the problem is still there. When the carafe is modified, this will be a great coffee maker. But, until they improve the carafe, I can not recommend it."
2,Leather Dream,I had some of this leather treatment that is clear and thought that is what I ordered. The clear treatment is AMAZING with new and old leather and restored it to look great. I was a little disappointed when this one arrived and it was the black. I am positive it was my error in ordering though - be careful when you place your order and submit for the right color that you need/want.
2,A clouded assessment,"I""m a big fan of Amy Goodman's work as a writer & a journalist but this book falls short. Perhaps Goodman sees Haiti through the lens of East Timor where she spent considerable time in the Nineties. But Haiti isn't as black & white a situation. There are many right & left wing factions with actors frequently changing sides. She also does not question Aristide's claim that he was kidnapped by the US govt. See Paul Farmer's The Uses of Haiti for a better intro to Haiti."
2,Not too informative,"I also got the book mainly b/c Noam Chomsky is a co-author. He's only written the introduction though, which doesn't contain many hard facts. The second chapter by Farmer is interesting, but doesn't develop enough to get all aspects of the picture, such as what's behind the corruption allegations against Aristide.All other chapters are interviews from the daily TV show ""Democracy Now!"". As the show itself, these interviews suffer from one-sidedness. The only people appearing in the talks are pro-Aristide, and show host Amy Goodman doesn't seem at all interested in asking tough questions to Aristide.This is what I'm always noticing when I watch her show. While she does a good job in gathering interesting information that is deliberately or inadvertently ignored by the main-stream media, her guests are typically biased and you hardly ever have people in her show disagreeing with each other."
2,not that good,The tone is surely good. It's a pity the same doesn't happen about intonation and pulse. It's strange how he run in every fast passage.
4,Very Good,This was given to me by my mother and I have enjoyed many of the recipes in this book. She now wants one for herself to use. Majority of the recipes are easy and take little time or preparation. I would recommend for those on the go with little time to cook.
5,Makes a great cup of coffee,"I had read a few not very favorable reviews about this coffeemaker, but decided to buy it and try it anyway. I'm so glad I did. It makes great coffee and has all the bells and whistles I need. Plus it is not expensive! I like the option to have a slower drip for deeper coffee flavor. The carafe doesn't drip and I like the design of the maker and the carafe. I very much like that it comes with the gold filter and that it has the automatic start and shut-off functions. This machine makes much better coffee than any of the other drip machines I have owned. And I do love a good cup of coffee."
1,"Cold coffee, poor design","I've had this coffemaker for 4 months now, and I am finally ready to throw in the towel and look for a new one.It makes only lukewarm coffee, and the ""filter"" basket is poorly designed. Even though it looks shut - it may not be. It must click shut, or no cofee will be made. Also mine sticks shut, and I have to wrestle it open every time. I have to pull it out to the edge of the counter to fill the resevoir each time also. Just an all around huge disappointment."
2,You get what you pay for,"My wife and I did not want to invest heavily in our at-home coffee maker and chose to buy this one. It has been troublesome. Every pour is a potential disaster. I've been drinking (and pouring) coffee for about 10 years, so I thought I'd catch on to the trick of not dribbling coffee everywhere but I never have. The quantity of coffee toasted to oblivion on our unit's warming plate can be measured by the pot at this point.There's a safety mechanism that sort of prevents the brewed coffee from dripping while the carafe's in use, but sometimes the lid catches (or something), resulting in the basket itself being disengaged. It's cumbersome. Part of the problem, no doubt, is that I'm trying to use it in the wee hours of the morning, but it's a COFFEE MAKER for heaven's sake."
1,Pass on this one.,This has to have the worst decanters I've ever used. Pours coffee on the table (or your shoes) almost as fast as it does the coffee mug. After having such great luck with the Delonghi Caffe Elite this was a big disappointment. Luckily the Caffe Elite was again available on Amazon and I ordered one right away and returned the Delonghi 12 cup to Lowe's where it was purchased the next day.
3,Good intro to investing in gold,"I'm a beginner at gold investing, but this book made a strong case for why I should. Better yet, it follows up with real advice on how to do it. It's a bit dated now (it predicts a collaspe of fiat currency years ago, for exampmle) but you can look past that and still get real value out of it."
4,Gold Gold Gold,"I have not yet restructured my portfolio to include a large gold component - but the authors do make a compelling case for it.With the past years dollar slide it make sense... but since printing the dollar is rising. So I'll wait. Nonetheless, it's a great examination of the issue. I recommend this effort."
2,More of the same,"I was disappointed in this book. It promotes the same hysteria and the same tired solutions of gold bugs everywhere. We know about gold. When is someone going to write about assets other than gold, and whatever ripple effect throughout society that a dollar collapse would cause?"
4,Good book,Nice explanation to the meltdown of the economy that we are going through and some recommendations. Would have been nice to read it in 2007 though...too late now!
3,Interesting read without a heavy sales pitch,"I respect the author for not shamelessly marketing his own service. He makes a very good argument for why the dollar's value should fall and offers advice on how to construct an alternative investment portfolio to protect your money.He warns people to own allocated gold deposits and many other methods of reducing transaction costs when purchasing gold and gold stocks.The book does leave you questioning whether the dollar really will collapse overnight, though. Some of the chapters were too short, probably to steer clear from too much economic theory.There are other, better, books explaining why monetarism is at crisis and how the dollar will suffer in coming years. This book does not go into the details, but it does have an excellent bibliography referring to these books and various sites for further reading."
4,Coming collapse of the $,"awesome book...I read it right after ""Hot Commodities"" by Jim Rogers...awesome book as well...US has alot of problems with the greenback and its possible demise as the worlds reserve currency...Jim has been talking about this as well for some time and is certain that the US will lose this status as the govt. busily prints money at will....devaluing the $ and killing its value, creating the real inflation problem...the book is very comprehensive in its argument and insightful in its recommendations...fast read!"
4,timely read on the history and projection of our monetary system,"Even though this book was written several years ago, the information is true and accurate and actually predicted where we are today in many instances. The rise of silver and gold hit the mark and one can follow the examples of how monetary policy from the past influenced the value of our currency to the present.This is a must read for anyone watching the monetary system and understanding the value of currency and alternative forms of money."
5,a very practical book,"this book is pretty cool. it has all the basic recipes, and complicated ones that are fun to make. there's also some good reading about how to set up your bar, how to get a job, and other good info. i didn't know anything before i picked up this book, but now i feel pretty good about bartending. i definitely recommend this."
2,Not worth the price...buy fresh localy if you can.,I tried these and must say they are not a very good deal for the money. I even got a response from the seller (although no offer to refund my money). Look for a local seller and save your money and taste buds for fresh.
2,Dryed Chantrelle Mushrooms,"Everything was packaged well, but there were no instructions on how to reconstitute them, had to go online and the mushrooms were not to my liking at all!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Can you spell ""overpriced""?",Eleven minutes for sixteen bucks? Even I don't love these guys that much. Watch it on youtube and save your money for a real Top Gear DVD.
3,Not worth the price...,"I ordered this dvd with the thought that perhaps it was a 60 Minutes show dedicated to Top Gear... 14.5 minute dvd... I feel ripped off. No bonus anything. 14.5 minutes, thats it!"
2,Very elementary,This is a simple book which introduces the reader to the art form. It has value as background in the subject and to amateur carvers. It is not a reference for anthropological exploration of North West Coast totem carving by any means. If you are looking for such this isn't the book for you. There is no adherence to form or style anywhere resembling anything close to the heritage of NWC art.
4,very descriptive and gave you all the information you needed,tO SUMM UP HOW i FEEL ABOUT THIS BOOK ALL I CAN SAY IS ITS WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR i PROMISE!
4,Works Great For My Needs,Do yourself a favor when you first get it and check out every input & output as well as all adjustments. I had mine about a week when I tried using channel 3 xlr input and even with everything cranked the level was just a faction of the others were just barely turned up. I should of known something was up when the light that indicated power was on would flicker and go out from time to time. But Amazon has a great return policy so all is back up in running before I had to send the original back.
5,Parasite Kleanzing Diet,"I found this book to be very informative and a great source of reference. Not only did I learn about the parasites in my body and how to rid myself of them, but I was also able to get some very valuable recipes from the ""Eating with the Seasons"" section. I have used ""The Herb Lady"" products for years and found her book to be just like her products, first rate!"
3,Not too bad for the money,"We got this machine as a wedding gift and it has been OK. It it true that it doesn't heat the water too hot, but it is decent. We are now shopping for a new one as the carafe lid is broken. Overall, I would recommend it if you are looking for a moderate machine."
1,"Looks good on the counter, that's about it","Like many other reviewers, we bought this coffee maker because of the sleek design and price. The filter basket has been a continual struggle - water gets caught up in the basket and causes overflowing which results in coffee grinds everywhere. There is nothing more frustrating than to set the timer at night and wake up to a big mess of coffee grinds and water. After about 18 months of use, it has finally died...probably due to the repeated overflow. I won't be purchasing a DeLonghi to replace it."
1,Plastic part broke-duct tape basket closed!,"Bought two of these for our workplace. In a matter of months, both of the basket closures had broken. We used rubber bands and/or tape to keep the baskets closed! Have now gone back to dependable Bunn!"
1,Terrible Coffee Maker,"Don't waste your money. New out of the box ours doesn't work right. It always leaves the filter basket full of water, no matter how little or how much water we use - this causes coffee grinds to overflow and float in our coffee. Also still drips a little when we use the pause function. It's all plastic -even the silver looking part on the front is plastic."
3,Broken part and carafe,I used to love this coffee pot until w/in the first 6 months a little plastic piece broke off and now the basket won't stay shut.In addition the carafe couldn't handle being washed on a near daily basis. It shattered and it is a pain to find a replacement. Buyer beware!
3,Just soso.,"I read the comments and bought this lotion. But it doesn't work that good on me. A little bit greasy and doesn't absorb well. It's OK regarding its low price, but don't anticipate too much."
2,bad test strips,"I bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips.I simultaneously had bloodwork at the Doctor's office when I did the test.Except for the total cholesterol, all the other tests were off. The manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done. Except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color. The test strips which are expensive were bad. I am planning on returning this product"
1,Would not recommend buying it !!!,"I purchased the product . Found it to be not accurate. Also in order to get your LDL result you have to use 3 types of strips and a formula to calculate it - Costly !! cumbersome !!! 3 times ""niddle"" your fingers !!I returned the product."
4,Not bad for cholesterol monitoring,"This is one of the best items I have purchased because it gives you guideline on how your cholesterol is so you can do something about it before you have your cholesterol done at the hospital. With diet and certain foods, you can alter the way how your cholesterol should be for the better. No blood test is the same every hour or day but it gives you a guideline and that is important."
3,Not accurate,"I bought this device to track my HDL.Several times after using the device I have had lab tests at my doctors office. The results from this device have been consistently lower by 10-12 points for my HDL.For example, my last HDL result from my doctors visit was 43 and this device tested my HDL at 32 in the same day. As some commenters have already stated, this machine is good for keeping tabs of trends but it is not accurate. It's a bit pricey for its lack of accuracy and also for test strips that you have to buy."
1,Completely wrong results,"I had been using this to monitor my cholesterol. To verify the results, I checked it the same morning that I was going to the doctor to check my cholesterol. The device said my cholesterol was 225... but the doctor said it was 183! Stay away from this product... its a waste of money and very frustrating to use."
4,Worked well for me,I thought this was convenient and easy to use. Seemed to give a pretty accurate reading.
3,Inaccurate but Helpful,From taking a hospital test and using CardioChek within 30 minutes of each other:Triglycerides- Hospital test 17% higher than CardioChek.Cholesterol- Hospital test 8% lower than CardioChek.A substantial difference. But you can still track TRENDS (whether blood levels are rising or falling over time) and that's important to know.
4,Happy with it.,"Happy with this product. Yes you have to get blood from 3 of your fingers I use it for HDL, Cholesterol and Triglycerides)but it is a small price to pay compared to it's benefits."
1,Very bad customer service - buyer beware,"I agree with the other 1-star reviews. Very incompetent ordering process, web site, and customer service representatives. The web site says 100% guaranteed. But, they sent two orders and charged me for three when I only ordered one. And, they refuse to correct the problem. In addition, the customer service representative is belligerent."
1,Bad Stay Away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,All i Can Say Is Bad These Crabcakes Are The Worst I Had To Throw The Rest Away My Wife Was So Dissapointed I Called Them Up And No Refund And All They Could Say Is Sorry Never Again I Learned My Lesson
2,A Lackluster Effort,"As I read this book, I couldn't help thinking that either a.) some other, less talented author wrote this and attached Feist's name to it, or b.) Feist himself wrote this in one three-hour sitting in between other projects. Having read and enjoyed many of Feist's novels, including the entire Riftwar and Serpentwar Sagas, I was utterly dismayed with the quality of ""Krondor the Betrayal."" The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is thin, and the writing in general is inferior to what I have come to expect of this author. I don't know what contractual obligations led Mr. Feist to release a book this poorly written, but he should be ashamed. Never again will I buy a book by Raymond Feist with the assumption that it will be a good read."
2,Quite Horrific,"Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because it's based on the best crpg ever. The book sucked tho... I've read the rest of the Riftwar series and Feist's writing and imagination seem to be be headed downhill. I think it's the money that keeps him going... if you flip to the epilogue he speaks of when he was called by the makers of Betrayal at Krondor to see if he wanted to work on the game and he said something like ""you can't afford me"" Well, I guess we now see what drives Mr. Feist, as he himself admits :) Anyhow his first 4 or 5 or 6 books are well worth reading but only read this one if you are having a mental breakdown because you need to read more about Gorath."
1,Disappointing considering Feist's other work,"As a fan of the Riftwar Saga which I read many years ago, I thought I'd re-introduce myself to Raymond E. Feist, and so I picked up this book, Krondor the Betrayal.Seeing so many other one-star ratings, I'm glad it wasn't just me that thought the book was a clunky read. The book definitely reads like a computer RPG, and unfortunately this translates into a formulaic plot, little to no character development, and cliched dialogue.Those new to Feist should flee from this title and instead pick up Magician: Apprentice, the first volume of the Riftwar Saga, a four book series.As far as Krondor the Betrayal, there is nothing remotely compelling about this book, and I cannot recommend it."
2,Only read this is you're a fan.,"The only reason I stuck with this book is that I had already read the Riftwar series and really enjoyed it. It was very boring compared with Feist's previous works. I haven't played the game, so that probably didn't help either.The good news is, Assassins and Tear of the Gods (which I am reading now) are very good, so Betrayal is worth a read just as a prelim to the rest of the Riftwar Legacy series."
3,the weakest riftwar book,"don't be put off by the other reviews, yes it is a weak book compared to the rest, yes it is a filler,yes it rehashes ideas from other books. why? because its based on a game based on the books, it is not an essential read if you read the others but it is important if you plan to read the riftwar legacy series it provides a good lead into krondor the assasins"
5,Very good!,"It's a good book even though I have played the game before. After reading this book, I went to collect the whole RiftWar series."
2,Go read his other works...they are much better,"This book is adapted from a computer game...the cover told me this, but actually as i read the book(i just bought it last week), i could tell that the author had ""copied"" the idea from a game...there was no links between battles so i was left to understand what had happened between the last chapter and the present one...one moment they are on the outskirts of some northern mountains and the next they meet some bandits somewhere south...there's no link at all, could be quite tricky..My advice for new readers: go read his other works maybe The Demon awakens or the The Demon aspolte.. they are much much better than this so-called computer game adaptation"
3,"Ehh, good concept, fair story.","This book, as you probably already know, is based on the game Betrayal at Krondor. Wonderful game, filled with rich story plots and subplots, and most important, memorable characters.Feist revisits this story in book form here. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a video game rather than a novel. If you're fans of the entire Riftwar Saga, then get this book to add to the collection (it's really a wonderful series). However, if you are unfamiliar with the series, this is not the book to get right away (instead, start with Magician: Apprentice and go from there). Krondor the Betrayal, and I'm sure this is the popular view, is really not a well written book, but it is an interesting story.And, for those of you who do not know Ray Feist's work, this is very atypical. He really is a wonderful writer in the rest of the series. This volume is just an anomaly."
1,The game was better,"It's a shame. The book could have been great - if someone had spent a little more time on it.I'd never even heard of the author until after I'd played the game. I read one of his other books a bit (Silverthorn), to see if it's quality matched up. And it didn't.Mr. Feist is capable of much better writing.Next to the (now free and still excellent) game and some of his other books - this just plain awful."
2,Never base a novel on a game!,"I'm sorry to say that I was not impressed withe Feist's latest addition to the tales of Midkemia. I have been an avid follower of his work ever since the Magician, but this book really leaves me cold. Where is the character development? Why has he resorted to reworking an old storyline in such a labored way? The biggest worry is that Betrayal is described as Book 1 of a series, please Mr Feist quit while you're ahead. I don't wish to be overly critical of a man who is a very accomplished author, but I get the distinct impression that this book was more inspired by marketing strategy rather than literary creativity."
3,A book about a computer game???,"I did not know that Mr. Feist wrote this book until I saw it by chance in a bookstore in the US during my holidays there. I immediately bought it as I simply love all his Midkemia-books so far and had hoped for a new series. I read this book on the plane and finished it at home the day after. I enjoyed it although I must say, that you can notice without any problems that the plot origins from a computer game. You have a problem and you have to solve it with several possible choices to choose from. I was a bit disappointed about that and I hope the following books will improve in this aspect. But overall this book is still worth reading!"
3,A readers review,"Definately not the best book ever written by Raymond E. Feist, but you also got to realize that this book is based on a game. There is very few books or movies based on a game that are actually good, so what do you expect? Still better than some books I've read lately, though. I think I'll go dig out my copy of Magician, and read it again."
1,"It really sucked. Trust me, it really did. Deserves a 0","Not only was the book unnecessary, it was costly for what basically was just the storyline of the game retold in a very sorry fashion. It was pathetic, really. There were a few thoughts and observations that weren't in the Computer game, but only a few. I mean there were some obervations made of Makala that weren't made in the game, and a little more info about the plot, but it was still not worth making a book out of. If you're going to continue producing books with such low quality, I suggest you hand the torch over to someone else that appreciates the characters you have come to care less about. In the future, I would suggest more Pug and less characters that will you'll never see again once the book is over."
3,1st book of the Riftwar Legacy is loosly based on the game.,"The first book of the Riftwar Legacy is loosly based on the computer game Betrayal at Krondor. Some characters we know from other books such as Aruthur, Pug, Gamina and Locklear others such as Gorath we learn about for the first time. As it is set between A Darkness At Sethanon and Prince of the Blood. The people who have read these books can expect the outcome of some characters. The books explores each of the characters well and is a great start to a new series."
2,Worst of the Midkemia series,"Though the computer game was great, the plot just doesn't translate into a good book. This volume can be easily skipped by all but the most avid fans of the Midkemia series."
2,Wait for the sequel,"This book is about a computer game. One that I have loved, and became my favorite one. The problem is that this is something I already knew. Its kind of boring to read if you already know how it ends. My suggestion is to wait for the 2nd book. For Mr. Feist.. I still loved youre writing. You're a truly gifted writer. I know because I am too a writer and I know how hard it is to create a great plot. But if you're planning to write a 2nd book about a game also (Return to Krondor) than I suggest you don't. Though I loved Return to Krondor I'll surely stay away if the 2nd book is also a review of a computer game. The great thing about the book is the Feist touch. You can see how a great writer sets up a plot, develop a character, and many more things. There is only one thing about Feist I can tell... that he is one hell of a writer. Thumbs up."
1,"Bad book, good author.","I have come to expect a high standard of writing from Raymond Fiest and was greatly disappointed by the almost juvenile style that this novel was written in. I got the impression that this was a very early piece of wtiting that had been dusted off and published without any attention being paid to present writing style, or the high standards that Mr Fiest's readers have come to expect. It might make you money Mr Fiest, but it won't make you fans."
2,Books based on video games are no treat,"Loosely based on the computer RPG ""Betrayal at Krondor"", this book is not up to par to the original trilogy or even the later sequels. More of a rehash than an original story. Worth it only if you are a fan, which unfortunately, I am."
1,This book stinks,I don't know anything about any computer game but I do know that this book reads as bad as the back of a cereal box.
1,I couldn't finish this book,"This is the first book by Feist that I TRIED to read. Other reviewers seem to have much higher regard for his earlier books and I may give them a try. This book was unreadable and I quit half way through- which I NEVER do. The dialog was ridiculous ""He said blah blah blah"" ""And then he said blah blah"" ""and then he said"". It really seemed like a 7th grader wrote the entire book."
3,Ya know.......,"THIS BOOK HAS THE MOST ANTICLIMACTIC ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN. EVER. Ok, now that I got that out of the way.. I mean, I played the game and all when it came out, and at least THEN it took me a while to beat the cheesy final guy (the first time). But the ending in this book will leave you with a sense of waste, like you just wasted a week reading a book to come to an ending like THAT. The more I read Feist's books, the more boring and predictable they are. Each character is exactly the same as every other one. They all talk the same way, all act the same way, and all think alike. And worst of all, they spend too much time reminiscing old times! This is the absolutely last book I'll buy by Feist!"
1,Horrible,Feist is one of my favorite authors but this book was absolutely horrible. Anyone who gives it more then 1 star has problems. I would of given it no stars but thats not possible. I couldn't even get past the first 2 chapters it was so poorly written. If you want to read something good by Feist read the Riftwar Saga.
3,Good but not great. Fiest has done better,"Raymond Feist is my favorite aurthor and I judge all other books on the ""Magician Apprentice"" and ""Magician Master"" this book just doesnt compare. ""Krondor the Betrayal"" just was not realistic in the manner which the characters in the book gained their power for example one part that really disolusioned me was when Pug and Owyn gathered magic as though it was a crop this was just too much like a video game. I know that it was based on the game which is why i gave it three stars because what it lost literarily it gained through its honesty to the game. All and all the plot was entertaing and Owyn is a loveable charecter though at times he seemed like Pug Light. I recommend this book only to people who have read Feist before because I dont want new Feist readers to give up thinking that this is the best Feist can write. Of all Fiests book this is the least entertaining but entertaining none the less."
3,"Not for those new to Feist, not for all Feist fans either","Although I have never played the role playing game the book was based, I found myself playing it at many points in this book. The book definitely reflects its game.However, it's not a bad read for Feist fans because the already present rich history and backdrop of Midkemia and the characters of Jimmy and Pug lend the book the character it lacks as a stand-alone (which is what makes it not so good a read for those new to Feist).It could have used more imagination. Gorath's character was the best new thing in this book.3/5 stars for effort and Gorath.-Huge Feist fan"
3,"Not too bad - then again, not too good","Mr. Feist tries too hard to follow the game logic that this book is based upon. What's good for game mechanics doesn't necessarily make for a thrilling book. Although, the character development of James and Locklear does make this book passable. Its an easy read - exciting in parts - long winded in others. Not Mr. Feist's best work but sets the premise for the rest of the books in the Riftwar Legacy series. If you are a devote follower of the Krodor/Midkemia adventures, you'll like this book. If this is the first book you are choosing from the author go back and get the Magician: Apprentice, Magician: Master book buy the same author!"
1,Disappointing - The Real Betrayal,"The writing is shallow, the characters two dimensional and the plot weak. These are the good points. I thought this book was written like a video game as I read it. The characters solve all encounters with enemies by killing them, they stumble across items that conveniently help them at the right time without any preamble, they get help or hints from inanimate 'gods'... I didn't know until the end that this was actually written after a game... I have never felt so put off by an author's grasping for dollars... beware the real betrayal... to you the reader."
4,Started slow but accelerated well enough.,"The book started just like the game itself which i must say is not very suitable for a novel but as the story continued, the good old feeling of Midkemia came back. Finally, the book ended well enough to take 4 stars from me. Captivating."
2,BETTER LEFT ALONE,"I have been a major fan of Feist for a long time now, though I am extremely disappointed with this book. I waited for 3 months to get it and now after reading only 100 pages I wish that I had ordered something else. If you can STAY AWAY."
2,Boring.,"If you played the game, do not buy the book. It simply retells the story of the game and does so in a turgid and plodding manner. A great disappointment from a great writer. Sometimes the money must be too good to pass up."
3,Entertaining but unsatisfying,"Since I love Raymond Feist's work and have played Betrayal at Krondor upwards of 9-10 times, I may have expected too much from this book. While it was enjoyable, and I found it entertaining to ""read"" a game that I had ""played,"" as a Raymond Feist book it is a disappointment.Although I went on to read the second book in the series, hoping things would improve, my initial impression did not change. Raymond Feist's writing added much to the game, but the game did not add much to his writing."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dark elves and bad men.Related to a computer game this book said when I read it, can't say how much, though. Those not so nice moredhel are returning, some years later, and the criminal guild has an exceedingly nasty new ruler.It is up to the usual band of stalwarts, some new characters, and even a dark elf that helps the Kingdom side out to try and do something about it.Another ok Midkemia adventure, pretty much what you would expect."
1,Betrayed ...,"at the cash register.I've read some of the other reviews, and it sounds like Feist is usually well regarded. Well, I guess I'll never find out, not after reading this awful book.Formulaic, cliche, and mind numbingly convenient. In the end, I pressed on out of some morbid curiosity. This is a great example of how not to write a book.The characters are all flat. I really got the sense that the author threw this together in a couple of weeks."
1,"Pathetic, lazy, what the heck was Feist thinking?","Word for word, this book was taken from the video game. Yes, Feist wrote for the video game, but way this book was transcribed from the game was lame, and down right lazy. I can understand wanting to write a book based on a video game that did very well - but since I loved the Riftwar Saga so much, the Legacy really hurt. The only real Betrayal here is to the fans of Feist.However, Krondor: The Assasins, the only part of the Legacy not transfered from a game was very enjoyable, and a an image of what the other two books could have been."
2,Tiresome,"Raymond Feist is a great writer and has produced some milestone fantasy books but sadly lets himself (and the reader) down with this one. I had read the reviews about the game influence on the book, but was prepared to make my own mind up. In the end the reviews were right, this is too one dimensional and is a series of little tasks rather then a flowing story supported by the characters that Feist usually does so well.Best avoided, but if you are a potential first time reader then read the brilliant Magician instead."
2,Repetitious,"Ok, so it's based on a computer game... that doesn't QUITE sum it all up, but it comes close. Betrayal at Krondor was quite possibly one of the coolest RPGs of all time. Unfortunately, all this book does is rehash the game. If you've never played it, by all means, pick up this book if you are a huge Feist fan. If you did play the game, this book will unfortunately simply repeat all of the events that occurred in the RPG. The whole Riftwar Legacy series isn't such a hot idea if you ask me. The second book, Krondor the Assassins, isn't much different... except that it's based on a really bad RPG instead of a really good RPG."
1,Both the book and the CD are junk!,Do not be lured by the fact that Feist wrote tis or that there is a CD included! This book was horrible. The worst I have read. The CD was not worth it either. There is nothing on the Cd that could not be found on the net.
1,"Not good, not good at all.","I was very dissappointed with this book. Feist is a great author and it is a shame that he applied his time (at least two hours) to a piece of junk like this one. The plot was scattered and not enjoyable; good games do not convert into good novels. I especially hated the fact that he turned previously lively and fun and deep charaters like Jimmy and Locklear into shallow stereotypes of their former beings. Read every other book by Feist (especially Faerie Tale and Magician Master) and leave this one alone. It was not good, not good at all."
3,"Fair, but lacks flair of old","First of all, I've never played Betrayal or Return never got around to those games. I picked this up cause I'm a Feist fan. Quite frankly I wouldn't call this book trash like some of the more militant fans here, but it's no where as good as the series that started it all. It was very nice to see Pug back in action.....Feist needs a series just on Pug, cause he's too cool a character to waste. But overall, the reading was very fluid and moved very quickly....let see what the rest of the series has to offer, perhaps this is just Feist setting us up for the other books in this new series."
2,Great scenes taken from the computer game but not much else,"Feist's books have been a really pleasure to read and I have read some books even more than once but this work based on my favorite computer game ""Betrayl at Krondor"", is really medium-level junk. Of course, characters and the plot is great as usual but everything else ""the fat"" in books which contain the most pleasure is not included in this novel. I hope Feist understands that next books could be more larger and detail-giving than this."
2,"Good Plot, but lots of Plodding","This is my first Feist book (bought at a big discount at a flea market) after seeing his many titles in regular bookstores. I am no big fan of fantasy and has never played the Game either. But I love his dragon, magic characters set amid olde worlde charm of kingdoms fighting for power and secret tunnels. And the big map is real cool. But I find that the story plods on uncessantly, with the young magician and his moredhel friend moving from one part of Midkemia to another (and another and another) throughout the book. And all they ever did was to get some message to ask the next character. I hope this is not what fantasy games are about. Having said that, I am buying Feist's first RiftWar book, Magician, to give him a second chance (I want to meet magician Pug when he was young, and hopefully the Oracle dragon again). Judging from the Amazon.com reviews, I hope I won't be disappointed."
1,A poor novelization of a computer game,"I have been reading Feist since he first came out, and Magician was reviewed in Different Worlds Magazine (I purchased an autographed copy). Krondor, the Betrayal is without a doubt the WORST thing he has written. I have purchased everyone of his books in hardback, the day they come out, but no longer. I placed the book on the shelf where it is gathering dust. I considered loaning it out, and then refusing to accept it back. I really hope he does better with his next book."
2,A dissapointing adaptation,"Unlike previous novels, this attempt by Fiest seemed more a story outline than a well thought-out book. The characters are quickly thrown together without much explanation, their actions and motivations often illogical, and the narrative often curt and uninteresting. Unlike Fiest's other novels that have engaging characters and novel plot twists, this attempt seemed much more like the cookie cutter yarns writers like Jordan or Brooks produce. True, this was an adaptation of a computer game. However, in the future, if Fiest intends to adapt more novels from his gaming line, I suggest he either write better computer game outlines or abandon adaptations in lieu of well written stories."
4,don't take your Chevy to this levee...,"'The Levee' is the second installment of Michael McDowell's southern gothic soap opera: 'Blackwater'. Reading the first installment, 'The Flood', is mandatory. In 'The Levee' we find the sleepy town of Perdido, Alabama changed with the construction of a levee. Yet our mysterious leading lady, Elinor, still creeps us out.Bottom line: a bit silly yet thoroughly enjoyable. Southern Alabama has never be so spooky."
4,An Excellent Read,This book is an excellent read on cooking and history. Bought it through a second party (Goodwill of all places!) and they sent a copy that was in excellent shape!Enjoyed the info and will use it as a reference for years to come!Too bad it is out-of-print!
5,Excellent preparation guide,The book is well laid out and easy to understand. After each chapter there are well thought out exercises and tasks to consolidate what you have just learned. The pinpoint exercises on the CD ROM are an excellent additional resource to enable you to practice what you have learned using the actual office application. There are easy to follow demonstrations too for anything you are unsure of. Pinpoint ran perfectly on my computer which runs on windows XP. Also check out Prentice Hall's website where there are additional resources.
2,Too easy for the MOUS Master,"Not to be self-aggrandizing, but instead I'll be rather blunt - I am a MOUS Master. That being said, Emily Ketcham's feeble attempt at MOUS prep for Word 2000 is infantile to someone who knows Word 2000 (and Notepad no less) inside out. Her lengthy explanation of how to use bold fonts just about put me to sleep, let alone into a permanent coma. I teach the MOUS certification track(as well as Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.1) with Tony Muser here at Kansas City Community College and, suffice to say, we've decided to invent our own textbook before resorting to Emily Ketcham's sophomoric effort. Word of advice on your next edition, leave out the how-to chapter on the importance of backing up a document every 2 minutes - in case you didn't know there's this new thing called UPS. I mean, get a clue already."
4,dad,This is a lot of fun and so far has held up. Our toddlers love to throw the bean bags or pretend they are the animals behind the game. Great for fine motor and hand-eye cordination.
3,Good darts with warning,"We bought these darts for causual dart playing. They get the job done and look nice. I really like that they come with a case that keeps everything organized and contained.I really like that the darts are contained, because they come with a warning label that reads: This product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of Califonia to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash your hands after handling.I'm not sure if this is standard for darts, but it is a little concerning. It also freaks out our guests when we announce that its time to wash our lead covered hands."
2,Not the best darts...,"Pros: Nice case, comes with everything you need to play, spare parts and some extras, dart tool it comes with is small but effective.Cons: Included parts are very cheaply made, flights come off easily, too heavy for the length of tip they include, the paint will flake away and even faster yet if your darts don't stick and hit the floorAll I can really say, is if you purchase these darts, have shorter tips available, and switch out the shafts for the metal like ones it comes with. Overall, this package needs some work, and I wouldn't suggest these darts to someone who is interested in shooting darts. I would only suggest these to the person who has a dartboard at home and wants to try some heavier darts than the small plastic ones."
1,NOT GOOD..,I bought these for my 12 y.o. son for Christmas .. for starters they are not as described.. I recieved hot pink ones.. and there is a WARNING of LEAD .. causing birth defects and cancer.. Wonder hot pink cancer to gift to my son..
5,You're going to love this album!,"This is such a warm, heartful album. I have given it to friends and family alike and they have loved it! It's a good mixture of folk, Celtic and rock styles. The lyrics are smart, clever, and thought provoking. Highly recommended."
3,Pure and simple,"After reading ""My Old True Love"" by Sheila Kay Adams, a novel about 1850's western North Carolina set in the time of the Civil War, I was drawn to listen to more of the hill-country music. The sound track from ""Songcatcher II"" is definitly a beautiful sample of that music. I enjoyed it immensely."
3,Songcatcher II,The way the music was presented in the movie was more interesting than the album. Some one else may find the album as entertaining as the movie.
3,Worth the listen,"While the music on this CD is not anywhere near as good as the music in the original movie, ""Songcatcher,"" it is better than much of the music from the movie because it is sung by mountain people as opposed to big-name recording artists (or at least mountain-recording artists as opposed to the likes of Emmy Lous Harris & Dolly Parton). Emmy Lou & Dolly do a fine job on the CD music from the original movie, but if I wanted to listen to Dolly, I'd buy her CDs. The music on this CD is soulful and inspiring."
2,Adjustable Speed Drive problem,"""Adjustable speed drive"" black box says made in Taiwan on it. Lasted less than 40 hours, glad the $915.50 item crapped out while the warranty is still in force. Waiting at least 3 weeks to get it back from a Delta Service Center where I personally delivered it to, supposed to be ready next weekend? Mid rpm range vibration also (when it runs). Long range, I am going to look for a ""simpler"" large lathe with 6 to 10 speeds, I do not need the infinite number of speeds offered by the very expensive ""variable speed drives"", which should not be in a dusty atmosphere, like a wood lathe area!"
2,Results are important,"Yes this book may be good in showing you how to write a resume and I used it to reformat my resume. But like everything else in this world, results obtained is the ultimate judge. I sent about 50 resumes using the format/s suggested in this book and it did not bring me a single interview. I am fully qualified for the positions I applied for yet could not land an interview! My own style of resume ( 2.5 pages) got me the job I was seeking. Enough said."
5,A good resource on resumes,"This is an excellent book. The author has done a great job in pulling together the elements which spell success in the quest for employment. I recommend it.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""The Accelerated Job Search"" and ""How to Spot a Phony Resume"" docwifford@msn.com"
2,Just because it's still in print after 30 years doesn't make it a classic,"While it is clear that Rowlison has a heart for hospitality, it is less evident what is his actual definition of hospitality. The book jumps from one topic to another, without any clear focus and little evidence of editing. There is little new here, nothing to justify purchasing this almost 30 year old book when there are many other books far more helpful in considering how to practice ""creative hospitality."" The amazing thing is that such a thin text is still in print after so many years."
4,A WONDERFUL FIND....GREAT FOR YOUR LEGS AND FEET,"THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL FOR THE COOK/BAKER IN YOUR FAMILY. THE LONG HOURS STANDING ON YOUR FEET USE TO KILL MY LEGS AND FEET, AS WELL AS, MY BACK. NOT ANYMORE!LOVE IT..................."
1,No no no no!!! (Please see additional comment!),"You do NOT want to purchase this mat if you have any traffic at all on it. You can stand comfortably on them, but do not walk around a kitchen with them on the floor!! Mine are two years old and after one year, they turned up at the edges, making them unsafe. The time I most need these are when we have family, and I'm in the kitchen a lot. Unfortunately, that's when I have to take them up because I cannot risk people tripping on them. For the expense, these are not worth the risk. Buy padded shoe inserts instead. They'll last longer and be safer!!(The above comment was THEN. This is NOW: See the comment I added below.)"
1,Nice on your feet but...,"Like another here I've owned this product for over a year. It is quite comfortable and eases strain on feet when standing/walking on the mat versus the hard kitchen floor surface. In that respect it very much lives up to its billing.However also like the other reviewer the edges on my mat started curling up. I at first was spinning the mat each week or so but now all the edges curl up and all the corners now stick up an inch or more which I consider a genuine tripping hazard. This is a shame since otherwise the mat is wonderful.If this is characteristic of these mats then, unless you're willing to buy a new one every year or so, I'd recommend you find another product for your needs."
5,Gel-Pro kitchen mat,Prooduct as advertised. Great for in front of the stove and sink. Easy to clean and makes for comfortable standing.
3,gel pro,Could be a good product but doesn't hold up well. It already has a small area that has a rub mark and a perm indented place. Would not rec wearing shoes on it. Have to be very careful with it. It is wonderful to stand on though. Does help your back and knees. Just not very durable.
