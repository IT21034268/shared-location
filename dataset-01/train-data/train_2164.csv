5,"""A Must Read""","""Brauns Battlin Bastards"" is a veterans personal account of life in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II.Lt. Braun served with the 158th Regimental Combat Team ""Bushmasters"" from training in Panama,battles on the islands of New Guinea,The Trobriand Islands,Wakde-Sarmi and Noemfoor Island until being wounded on Luzon in the Phillipines.Braun has a wonderful ability for story telling and his personal(and often hilarious) anecdotes will provide hours of enjoyment."
2,Missing content...,"This guide is perfect if you just want to beat the game and be done with it. This guide is HORRIBLE if you are like me, and want to get all endings and find all the secrets. This guide has the nerve to actually tell you about about secrets, and then NOT tell you how to obtain said items and/or info. For example, if you wanted the ""Rebirth"" ending, you have to have several items in your inventory at the end of the game. The guide tells of this ending, and the items and all but one of their locations. Obviously, they forgot to put in the item description next to the name of the item. I actually had to go and look it up online...even after PAYING MONEY for this ""complete guide"".I also found several regular items (example handgun ammo, health drink, etc) not mention in the walkthough.I advise just printing out a user written guide from one of the million cheat sites, sadly enough.And Yes, I have the correct guide for the system I am playing it on."
5,Caution you may get hooked,"I am not much on games, but I got this one for my adult daughter. I find some of the violence objectionable but I am hooked on this game. I think if you love mysteries, and get satisfaction in solving a mystery, you will get hooked on this game. I love this game and would recommend it to any adult seeking adventure, terror, suspense and a great love story on this man's quest for his dead wife. I find this intriguing and I can't wait to get to the next level, to explore along with James this scenic, often scary foggy setting, great graphics to a ending that is gripping and surprising. That's my take on it, I absolutely love it, but beware it is for adults, I am even squemish with some of the violence, so not for the young ones."
1,"Good at first, and then...","I bought the two-receiver version of this phone, and really liked it...that is, until the base unit died. Sent it back under the one year warranty, it took them forever to replace it with a factory reconditioned one, (which came back with a 90 day warranty, cheating me out of a few months). It lasted a month and died again. Now they are telling me it will cost 48.00 to fix. No thanks. Lesson learned, I'm buying a Panasonic this time.UDATE> I really like the Panasonic KX-TG2344B I got this time. I was able to set it up using the quick instructions, unlike the Uniden, which was overly complicated, and had an 80 page manual written by aliens (with an index that didn't match the pages). The Panasonic handsets are simpler, easier to use, do everything the Uniden does, and the speakerphone on them sounds better."
4,Wonderful for the skin.,I was introduced to this serum during my wedding-prep facials and it saved my skin. I was living in Sounthern California at the time and the water was wreaking havoc on my VERY sensitive skin. This serum put me back on track and I was glowing on my big day. During our recent move across the country my skin acted up again and I actually developed painful rough patches. As soon as I started using the serum again my skin cleared. I STRONGLY recommend for extremely sensitive skin.
5,"Colorful pictures, LOTS of trucks!","I gave this book to my son when he turned 2. Fortunately it was the last thing he opened because he did not want to do anything but look at those trucks! He is now 3 1/2 and it is still a favorite book. The pictures are big and bright and there are many kinds of trucks to delight the children. The accompaning text may be a little more than a 2 year old needs, but it is nice to be able to grow with the book."
4,It worked...for 3 months,"My 15 month old son started to explore his surrounding. We installed the locks to prevent him getting into all the kitchen cabinets. The locks did stop him...for a while. But these type of locks are too simple. My son figured it out in 3 months. Not that big a deal for us since he can understand and follow our orders and advices a lot better than he was 3 months ago. Still, if you want the locks to be effective longer than 3 months, you might want to go for something more complicated."
3,Swivel not so easy,"The lock itself works well from stopping our 16 month old daughter from opening our kitchen drawers, but the swivel feature is very hard to turn with two hands, let alone one hand like the product information claims. The swivel was a nice to have feature, so it's not the end of the world that it doesn't work well. We just use the locks in their normal position all of the time."
5,Tried to b greener,We tried to be greener but those tabs were not cleaning our dishes so we came back to the best & we r here to stay
4,Dishes are always clean!,"I use the Subscribe and Save Program through Amazon for this product and have always been very happy with this dishwasher tab. My dishes always come out spotless and I have never had a problem with food particles. I do at times see some white soap particles floating in the water on the bottoms of glasses on the top shelf of my dishwasher (the glasses are turned over in the dishwasher and water will sit in the little indentation on the bottom of the glass or bowl). I just rinse it under water if I see it, but I have had this problem with other brands of dishwasher detergent. I really like the individual tabs and will continue to purchase this brand."
2,"May work in other dishwashers, not so much in ours.","Left dishes, mummm let's say less than clean. Used them up by using two per wash cycle & that works well. Will go back to powder when they are gone."
5,Great product!,Love this product. Doesn't leave film or spots on your dishes and gets them clean! Plus it was a great price!
4,Tablets don't dissolve,"Like the other reviewers mentioned, the red tablet does not always fully resolve. Also I wish that each tablet wasn't individually packaged. It does clean the dishes well without residue though. I would purchase again."
2,Gross film,"Every time I've used these, my dishes are covered with a nasty residue. I have to re-rinse or even scrub everything by hand, which completely defeats the purpose of a dishwasher. I haven't done a whole lot of troubleshooting yet, but it's either these tabs, or the Finish drying agent."
1,Dishes are far from spot-free,"I bought a box of these because they combine Jet-Dry (which, I'm sorry, does not work) with a pre measured tablet of detergent. The results are horrible. Dishes are barely clean and covered in spots. Do not waste your money, go with Cascade 2-In-1 Action Pacs instead."
1,Works great if you enjoy re-washing your dishes.,"Leaves a powdery residue on about half of the dishes on the top rack. I have washed with this product on every setting on my dishwasher, and it still leaves the residue. My dishwasher runs well and I keep it extremely clean. Don't waist your money!"
1,Taking finish off my ceramics!!,"OK, OK, it cleans very well. But it is taking the finish off my ceramics--coffee mugs, fine china, whatever! In the one month we used it, everything that went in regularly faded. Maybe OK for pots and pans, but nothing else."
4,Good Package Deal,"This was a great deal on the Finish product, I needed them and was lucky to see them posted at such a good price."
4,The only One I use,"I have been using the powerball tablets for many years now. They do a great job and are a pretty good value. I find they do a better job if I just put the tablet in the bottom of the dishwasher, rather than putting it in the dispenser. I started buying them from Amazon because the price is about $1.50 less than my grocery store, but I have found that a lot of the tablets are broken, however I don't think the dishes can tell the difference."
5,Beats Cascade Liquid!!!!,"I am a Cascade baby, meaning the only thing growing up that we used was Cascade. Yes, we did try the cheaper stuff and my sister 1 time bought a cheaper brand that didnt work. All I knew was I was never going to use anything but Cascade. Well, my boyfriend kept complaining that are dishes weren't coming clean enough and I thought it was just because he didnt know how to do dishes, I mean when I did them they were a little spotty but it didnt bother me to much. So he brought home Electrosol to try, I was hooked after the first use. After we ran out he tried getting a similar brand which didnt work the same. So I ordered Electrasol in the 100 count from Amazon. No more Cascade for me, It I guess pays to change once in awhile."
1,Overpriced and doesn't work!,"I bought these tablets when the generic giant bucket of Kirkland dishwasher detergent was not available at Costco. I will not be making that mistake again!I have never had as many dishes come out of the dishwasher dirty. In fact, I have had dishes go through several cycles and still not get clean. This is especially true of flatware.When I would use dishwashing powder, I was always conservative and only put a bit in each dispenser, so this is not about volume. I now have to resort to using 2 tablets in each cycle and I still have to cross my fingers that my dishes will come out clean. That means it is costing me over 35 cents for each load of dishes I have to do.I could not be more dissatisfied!"
1,NOT working as advertised,"Contrary to its advertised, supposed effectiveness the cleaner has consistently failed to remove tea stains or baked-on foods such as lasagna. At that, it's not worked better than other, less expensive products. Apparently, the reviewers praising it must have been under some sort of influence, and most certainly not the influence of this product's exceptional effectiveness."
4,Finish powerball tablets,This product works very well in my dish washer. I am very pleased with the tablets. They completely dissolve and don't leave any residue.
4,"great product, bad packaging.....",These poweball tabs work great.I ordered the 100 count that ships in a cardboard can. Arrived with lid open about a third of the tablets are broken.The individual packaging of each tab has allowed them to still be usable.Love the product. Bad manufacturer packaging combined with Amazon's infamous one thing in an oversized box with little to no packaging contributed to the problem.
5,dishes shine now,"the best, gets the dishes very shining clean, and I got several packs a a great price."
5,Easy to use,"I love finish tabs because they get my dishes clean without me having to rewash them and they're much easier to use than dishwasher detergent. All you have to do is put one of these in the detergent spot, close it up, and start the dishwasher."
3,Leaves white powdery stuff all over the dishes,"I will say that my dishes are ""clean"" in that there is not any food remains on the dishes. But the glasses and stainless all have a white powdery residue. My dishes probably do, too, but they are white so I can't see it. I have a brand new dishwasher and it came with 2 of these and some Finish liquid that goes in a separate dispenser. Since it came with the dishwasher, I ordered this on Amazon before we installed it. The price was good, but wiping down all the dishes before I put them away sort of negates the pleasure of having a dishwasher."
4,Easy to use and very effective,"The Powerball tablets are a lot cheaper than the Quantum tablets and seem to do the same job. They work with just glassware and with dirty, greasy pots and glassware. Quantum gets better reviews but we don't see any need for them. We use the Quantum tablet samples that came with our washer and then switched to Powerball with the same apparent results. BTW, we always use JetDry in the dispenser and use non-heated dry.Note that the Powerball instructions say not to use them with short wash cycles. Presumably, to do their work, they need the longer cycles common on new machines designed to work with phosphate free detergents."
5,Great,These are the best dishwasher tablets that I tried (and I have tried tons!) I love them in orange scent the best.
4,Better than regular Cascade for the price.,After all phosphates were removed from soap products regular Cascade just didn't cut it any more unless vinegar or something else was added. Tried the Finish Powerball Tabs as they were less expensive than Cascade Complete. They seem to work very well in our dishwasher. Our water isn't overly hard but we do not soften it either.
3,not as good as cascade tablets,"These work ok but the cascade tablets i had worked much better, also it would be nice if they could find a way to not have them wrapped individually."
2,Nothing special for us,"I was excited about using Finish Powerball tablets given the reviews on Amazon. But in our experience, it was nothing special. It didn't get rid of already filmy residue on glasses, as some others reported, and it actually left some minor residue on some glassware, plates, and plastic utensils. Cascade Complete did a better job, and we'll return to using that when this box runs out. First-time users of Finish, don't get your hopes up too high."
5,Simply the best dishwashing detergent,"I've tried literally every dishwashing product out there because I like my wine glasses sparkling clean. And I have to tell you that nothing gets the job done better than the Finish Powerball.Note: I tried their gel tablets and thought they were a disappointment compared to these.Costco has a similar offer, but since I do not go there often, I buy these with subscribe-and-save and have been very happy about it.Definitely worth a try if you like spotless glasses and sparkly clean plates."
5,Excellent dishwashing tablets!,This has been a very good product as recommended by Consumer Reports! Our old dishwashing detergent was not taking off all the food properly. These Finish tablets seem to work really well. You can even leave egg on your plate and not have to pre-wash your plate before putting it in the dishwasher. With our old detergent we had to wash every dish! Why have a dishwasher if you have to do that?
5,Great Clean,The Finish Powerball tabs did a better job than other tabs I have tried in the past. Everything was clean and shiny..
3,Not bad,"Good alternative to powder. I'm rating this a little low, not based on performance, but based on appearance. My 2.5 year old seen the box and thought it was candy. She threw a fit when I put it out of reach... You would think these companies would be forced to conform to some 'poison' looking packaging, instead of something that looks like candy"
1,Didn't work,Didn't work in my dish washer. Other companies work but Finish wouldn't even break down in the dish washer. When I took it out it was still whole.
2,Many came broken,"I love how these clean. I've bought them in the store and really enjoyed them. I thought buying these with the Subscribe and Save would be a great way to get them. However the box I received has many broken or crushed. Very few are whole and therefore cannot work as well as they normally do. The price was great, the product bought elsewhere is great, but buying it off of Amazon was a disappointment."
5,From Back Cover ~,"In Matthew 24 the disciples are eager for details of Christ's trimphant return--they want to know when and how. And Christ answers their questions. He describes the signs that will precede His return, outlining the calamity, confusion, and corruption that will precede the second coming. In chapter 25, read of the results of Christ's return on people and nations. As Christ called the disciples to constant faithfulness, so He call us to be ready."
3,"Not as edgy as their first album, but a decent effort","I'm starting to enjoy this one more and more with each listen, though I was initially disappointed that it did not contain the punk ""edge"" that made their first album ""Employment"" so exciting. This sophomore release has more of a pop emphasis and feels a little more commercially forced, in my opinion. I have no doubt that ""Yours Truly, Angry Mob"" will be more accessible for American audiences and radio airplay, as there are some very catchy tunes and less of the angst that earmarked their debut album. These guys are an absolute kick to see performing live so catch them in your area if you can. Fans of their first album may find this one less enjoyable, but new fans will definitely flock to the Chiefs with this 2nd, albeit more commercial, effort."
3,"A mild disappointment from ""Employment""","Okay, so when I heardEmploymentI was hooked from the very first listen. This record has some of its qualities but what got me into it was the urgency and its resonated energy from beginning to end. It's an excellent debut record and one of the finest releases of its respective year.This on the other hand is sadly pretty mediocre. It isn't that bad, but the energy seems kind of tired by comparison. I usually try not to jump on the sophomore slump bandwagon, and in fact I'll give them antoher chance. To see that I don't view them as a one-album wonder like on this what made me skeptical. Sometimes the songs are actually decent but not that fun to listen to. And that's what matters to me. ""Ruby"" is great and there's some other good moments like ""Heat Dies Down"" but for the most part you can't help but feel they could have put more life into this record.Definitely not one of my favorites this year but nothing too terrible."
1,Fizzled in Leeds!,"Terrible!I was a fan of their first CD. Which I found fun, energetic, with most songs full of interesting beats.But this!? This, Is the worst!There is ""nothing"" in this CD that invokes anything like the first. The songs are completely unbearable for me! I cannot express how disappointing is it to find out this is what the kaiser chiefs have been leading to.Barely a catchy tune, old and trifled. The songs sound like they are trying to be like the Beatles and other Brit pop genre music.In this brit pop gone bad CD The Kaiser Chiefs have abandoned any resemblance to punk. The songs are boring and repetitive with no inspiring beat. The lyrics are lame!!Wow! What the hell happened!?If you were a fan of the first CD, you'll most likely hate this!"
4,REAL COOL CRUISING ROCK 'N' ROLL,"KC are part of the current new wave of garage RNR that is real cool, fun and enjoyable especially in the car.Very tight and well produced with upbeat rythms, hooks and melodies and highly recommended for RNR fans."
2,Ehh...,...Buzzcock wannabes. Not a terrible record. Listenable but definitely not original. Why the heck does the drummer have to sing everything the singer sings when they play live?? Dude needs to relax.
3,listen to it first,"Ruby is definitely one of my favorite songs of all time, but i listened to the album at a friends house, and the rest of the songs just didnt do the same thing for me. kaiser chiefs just probably arent the right style of music for me. so i just suggest to anyone who heard Ruby and loved it, listen to the whole album before you buy it."
3,Not the best,"Except for the single ""Ruby"" really nothing else on this album rocks that good. When listening through the album the sound starts getting a bit boring. If you are purchasing this album based on ""Ruby"" you might be better off just getting the single. If you are a Kaiser Cheifs fan then you'll probably like the album but not really love it."
1,Old & HARD,This product previously ordered and excellent but this time tasted old and was very hard---finally threw it away.Still have not figured out how I ever got it in first place as ordered another product from Amazon and somehow got this as well?????
2,Was Not Impressed!,Bought this phone and kept it only a week ... didn't have any distance from the station and just didn't work well at all.Went and returned it for the Uniden DXI 7286-2 and now I am a lot happier ... this phone has great range and is clear.Friends had told me Uniden was a good phone and I'm glad I tried another one cause I am happy with 2.4 GHz phones we have now.
2,"Range is limited, lots of static","We tried out a Panasonic 2.4GHz phone before this one, and it had range and static problems too. This phone is quite clear within about 40-50 feet of the base, but in our house this doesn't take you far. Get beyond that range, and you might be able to find a position in which to hold the phone that it's not staticky, but if you move a couple inches, you get static again.Another nit: the memory dial only stores 20 digits, which isn't enough to program an MCI calling card, for example.We're going to try the AT&T 5830 next, and we'll see how that works."
1,did not work,the item was broken when i received it. i sent it back to amazon. i went to order another and you told me it was discontinued. I was very disappointed. the only good thing was that the return was easy and i received a refund in good time.
2,To Big,I think now days with technology so advance these phones should be design smaller like cellular phones.
1,FIVE point 8 GHz? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha ...,"...Give me a break!Just out of curiousity, I bought this one at a local store and compared it to my trusty 900MHz Uniden (about half the price).Guess what?The two phones sounded PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, in fact the 900MHz one was actually a little clearer in some parts of the house.I will say though, the 5.8GHz phone does sound better than the disastrous 2.4GHz Uniden I bought and returned last year. But this one's going back too...why pay more for what is basically the same performance?Again: DON'T BELIEVE THE ADVERTISING B.S. !!!!I'm giving this phone 1 star not for its actual performance, but for the absolutely shameless advertising HYPE around it.(This is kind of like a 3.0GHz PC compared to a 1.2GHz PC: with 90% of commonly used applications, their performance is virtually identical...only you'll pay a lot more for the bigger number GHz.)"
4,Good Value for Money - Wireless-Network Friendly,"I bought this to replace a Siemens 2.4Ghz phone system that never worked right in the presence of my wireless network (802.11b). While this is, strictly speaking, a hybrid 5.8GHz/900MHz phone, it has been completely unaffected by the network, and has yielded excellent clarity, good volume, and overall good usability, for a basic phone.Complaints/concerns are the lack of a battery indicator and the lack of a ""mute"" or ""hold"" capability.Range is good but not great -- we get about 50-60 ft. in our electronics-laden (but timber-frame) house before some static clicks and pops start to show up -- while this is not as good as our 900MHz phones, it is within my expectations.For the price, I think this is good value and quality."
2,Do not recomend,I did not get good reception throughout the house. I used to have a Uniden tru346 2.4 and it got much better reception. I'm returning this phone because I can't walk into the other room without a lot of phone static.
2,Buggy and Caller ID Stopped Working,"This phone eats batteries and is buggy as heck. Worst of all, the caller ID suddenly stopped displaying. Cannot recommend."
3,Hey 'Huntsville!' How much were you paid to write that?,"These Amazon reviews are getting less and less reliable. The earlier review titled -- ""The clearest of any phone in the 'GHz family' I've used, December 7, 2003"" Was a rather obvious paid endorsement. No one takes time to write our 20 bullet-points in a product review. I urge everyone to ignore Huntsville and be VERY skeptical of positive Amazon reviews."
3,"Great price, poor sound","I used this phone with my VoIP line and had problems with the sound quality. Everything sounded great on your end, but there was constant static on the other end of the phone. Changing locations of the base unti made no difference, and my old 900 Mhz cordless sounded fine."
3,"Great sound, but too much static away from the base","I got this phone and was initially thrilled with the sound quality and how well it works with my headset. However... When I clip the phone on and try to move from my office upstairs to roam around downstairs, the reception gets really bad. There is so much static I can't hear well enough. I plan to return this unit and try another one. I hope it's just a bad unit and that the next one will perform better."
2,Battery life was real short (less than 6 months),"The battery went on this phone before 6 months. Although the phone worked well when the battery retained a charge, I gave it a bad review because a phone should last longer than 6 months."
1,Stopped working after 2 months,The range was never good and the phone no longer works... I recommend the $19.99 version!
1,"Looks good, but Not acceptable at All!!","I bought this phone as a gift for my mother and was very dissappointed. Worst phone that she has ever used. The reception/range was horrible and there was intolerable static whenever it was used near TV sets. My mom called Uniden and tried the suggestions they had to no avail. I had confidence in Uniden and figured that the major price reduction was no need for concern, but I was terribly mistaken. I see other customers have had the same problem so it leads me to believe that these problems are inherent with this model and that the price is reduced in order to liquidate inventory. Think twice about buying this phone, pay a little more, and opt for a different model."
3,"Good, but not as advertised","Clarity is not excellent, and there is no mute button (I thought it was a given...). Otherwise, not a bad cordless."
4,Great 5.8Ghz buy!,"I have an 80211b wireless network in my home so I was getting interferece with my 2.4Ghz cordless phone. This is a great 5.4Ghz phone that is packed with features for a reasonable price - many of the other 5.4Ghz phones are quite expensive. The phone has integrated callerID display, redial, and the standard cordless phone features (incl a headphone jack). I wish it had a mute function so I could use it for work-related conference calls, otherwise it would be 5 stars."
2,Do Not recommend,"We purchased this phone and have never been happy with it from day one. First of all, the volume is really low on this phone, even with the volume all the way up, it is still hard to hear the person you are talking to. Second, the range on this phone is really poor, we can only get about 30 feet away from the base before it begins to break up. We are ditching the phone and getting something else."
1,Cheap Feeling and Lousy Range,"Undoubtedly the worst phone I have ever owned! Despite promises of crystal clarity and long range, I can't really leave my 20 sq.ft. office without a lot of interference-- and I live on a farm with very little in the way of electical interference!Our old 900mhz phone has better range and clarity and doesn't feel so cheaply made. I still use that for 'important calls.' The earpiece speaker on this phone is a loser--I get much better quality on my Sanyo cell phone.Whoever the 'electronics fan' who wrote two rave reviews for this phone is, he or she is certainly a phone-y."
5,Play this game 3 feet from the TV and turn up your speakers,"I read the reviews, bought this game last night and it's true what they're saying. Rez is an explosive virtual reality experience. Only 4 levels in this game, but play them over to see if you can score higher and unlock hidden doors. Some will like it and some won't but either way you should still buy it just to see how out-of-whack this game can get."
1,Its depend on your perception,"This is the game where every person will have different opinion. If you like this type of game, you'll like it so much. If you hate it, you'll hate it so much. I'm in the second category. Some people like this game but not me. For me, this just 5 stage short arcade game. And the worst is, everytime you lose in the boss battle (every stage) you have to repeat it's 5 minutes boring stage again and again. Better try before you buy. Yes, I think this game is overated (because of Sega name, maybe?)"
4,Does not work with Logitech Wireless Controller,"The game is simple, engaging and fun. But I cannot get it to work with my logitech wireless controller."
1,Monotonous,"This game was fun for ten minutes. They somewhat took my idea for a videogame, but I would do it much better. The enemies attack in the same formation everytime, and all the songs pretty much sound the same. This isn't a shooter, it's a boring semi-interactive music video."
1,yawn,"If you want to play a game with some kicka$$ music in the background then play ""Armored Core"" with Metallica's Black album, or some other heavy metal music, or some good techno music, or anything else cause that would be better than the wack tunes on this game."
4,"Excellent, but NOT a music game.","This is an excellent game -- everything you read in the five-star reviews is true: the graphics are stunning, the gameplay is fun, and it's even fun to watch someone else play.My only warning to you is this: do NOT expect a music game like Frequency or Amplitude. Rez is really just a shooter. The musical part of the game is merely an interesting feature, not the game's central theme. It's true that the objects you shoot explode with a musical phrase instead of a bang, but there's no way to control the placement of the notes. You're not really playing music, you're just kind of hearing it.I highly recommend this game, but only as a fun shooter with amazing graphics -- which also contains a clever musical element."
5,High praise for Death of Innoccence,"I know the surviving girl of this story and let me tell you at the time when this happened I was scared to go anywhere by myself,as I was the same age as her. I am very glad that she got her story out to the world and that those sick people got their punishment(s).An excellent book."
5,Schechter is King!,"Harold Shaechter is my favorite true crime writer because he chooses such interesting subject matter (Jane Toppan, Ed Gein, Albert Fish, Jesse Pomeroy) and really emerses his readers in the time and place of the murders. As a Bostonian, I especially appreciates it when he takes on some of out home grown deviants (Toppan and Pomeroy.) He captures the truth of the case, the whole truth, before they were infamous, during their ajudication and, most importantly, after, their lives in prison.If you are fan of Caleb Carr or Mathew Pearl, I highly recommend this book and Shechter's others."
2,Sensationalized beyond belief.,"I am doing a research paper on Jane Toppan and thought this book would be a good help. It has solid facts, as far as I can tell, but what I cannot stand is the language. The whole thing reads like a penny dreadful - the author passes judgments like calling Lydia Sherman a ""monster"", or describing Jane Toppan as someone who had a side of her ""which was wholly diseased"". Were these women sociopaths? I'd say absolutely. Is Schechter a psychologist or qualified to diagnose? No.Can the purple prose and this would be a good book; with the over-the-top way these women are described, I can't give it more than two stars. This is not a book for the serious criminologist; don't bother."
3,"Nice sound, kind of bulky for baby","These are on the larger side. They are very loud and make a very nice sound, but they are also kind of bulky for baby. She'll enjoy them more as a toddler."
4,Cute!,These were perfect for my 2 boys! They are just the right size for my 10 month old and 2 1/2 year old. They look just like the picture!
5,Orange,"We got orange ones with yellow details (colors vary). They sound good, are sturdy, and are fantastic baby rattles/drumsticks. Glad we got them!"
2,Smaller than I thought.,"It's very small, quality is average at best. I bought it for a friend who like the Egyptian god Thoth, but due to size and quality, didn't bother to give it."
2,"Not Worth the money, get the glue!","Very cool looking toy, but very cheaply made.The figure I received also will not stand up, legs are uneven lengths. I very gently tried to bend figure to stand and its arm snap off..5mins out of the box, garbage. The main body is made from very brittle plastic. Also the beak on mine was bent.I'd love this same paint job on a better toy. I was able to glue arm back with super glue but these shouldnt not be for sale if they dont stand, BAD Q.C. Booooooooo......"
3,Hit and miss,"Really quiet, but the bearings died really early, so whenever I turned on the PC it started rattling. It was a good cooler until then, but it would be a smarter idea to get a corair or something like that."
2,Remix of songs,"If you want a remix of the songs, then this is what you will get. The songs, like ""rock & roll party in the streets and eagles fly alone"" aren't even close to the original versions, If you are looking for the original then I would not recommend this CD"
5,Like Being There,"This book opens the time capsule on the making of Kind of Blue and jazz in the late fifties. In contrast to Niesenson's recent work on this album, this book provides a great deal of new information. The description of the studio itself, an old church, and the engineers who recorded the album and their methods and equipment was fascinating. The book captures not only the almost supernatural alignment of the jazz moons of three of the most dominant figures in jazz, Miles/Trane/Evans, but it also explains the practical business of producing and promoting jazz albums in this time period. I simply could not put it down."
2,Works but slows down internet connection,"I needed an 8-port router to add access points in the house. This router worked as advertised and is easy to hook up. However, after installing this router the download speed dropped by 1/3 from my 4 year old 4-port Belkin router. Consequently, I had to pack this router up and ship it back to the seller."
2,"Dlink DIR-130 - it's ""Meh"" @ best","I picked up this piece of kit after my dlink 808vi went down (shame too cuz that was a great router IMHO) - I needed 8 ports and preferred that the router and firewall be in one device since it was one of two 8 port routers fitting that category it won. It has been ok (mostly meh though for the geeks who may be reading) but its features are somewhat vague to setup even for an experienced user. The port forwarding and firewall setup screens are annoying and quirky with stuff like not letting you edit / select / deselect depending on what its got going on at that moment. Would I buy one again? Most definitely no. Could/would I recommend it for somebody - again no. Spend your hard earned cheddar on somethin' better - that's my 2 cents worth.MattA+ Certified Remote Support TechnicianAurora, CO"
1,Nice features but will die in 2 years,"DLink has very nice products and a full product line. Tempting... I have 3 gone bad in less than 2 years on average. Warranty is only 1 year. The first one died shortly after 1 year of operation. I replaced it and purchased the 3rd unit two months later for our brand new second location. On my 3rd unit I got an extended 2 year warranty but it died 1 month after the extended warranty expired. Actually, both died at about exactly the same: just a little over 2 years - two months apart. Nobody can convince me that this is coincidence.I moved away from Linksys because their SOHO equipment line forgot about the Small Office and focuses only in the Home Office and Home devices. I have had my prejudices about other brands like Netgear, SMC, Allied Telesyn, Belkin and 3Com but I am reconsidering these brands. DLink and Linksys use nice cute (sexy) names to say the same thing in order to sell, focus on the technical specs and features. Shop smart use common sense."
1,Useless as a brick,"This quick reference doesn't do you any good. The information is formatted in such an illogical fashion -- I've yet to figure out the logic, in fact -- that I haven't been able to find anything I was looking for. Get O'Reilly's Definitive Guide to DHTML or CSS. You'll spend just as much time looking it up in one of the O'Reilly books, but you'll at least find what you're looking for."
4,Stethoscope,The stethoscope works fine. I just did not get the color that i purchased and it was a week late without any notice.
5,Great!,amazing product it has just what you need and it works perfectly! the black color gives it a realy nice touch
5,Beautiful stethoscope!,Bought for son who is starting nursing school in January. Excellent product! I have had several over the years and this one is the best.
5,wish,"I wish I would have bought this stethoscope earlier!!! I love it, it takes out background noise, so when your riding lights and sirens in the back of the ambulance, all you hear is your patients heart and breath sounds. Hope you enjoy as much as I do!!"
4,littman master classic II,I work in outpatient OB/GYN. The master classic II is the perfect clinical screening tool in this setting.It is light weight and the acoustics are great. My 20 yr Master Cardiology stethoscope fell apart and I was not sure what to replace it with. I chose the Master Classic II based on the reviews I read here. I am not disappointed.
5,EMT use,"I work on an ambulance and when you are in the back, it's bumpy, it's loud and so forth. I can hear clear as day with this stethescope and it's purple! It's a win win, buy it!"
4,Great stethescope.,Can easly hear both high- and low-pitched heart sounds. Will use this as my primary stethescope for years to come. [Note: I'm not pursuing cardiology]
5,Great for EMS,Great stethoscope for EMS. Design dosen't snag and sounds are great. It is very comparable to my wife's Master Cardiologist without the extra cost.
2,Cardiac nurse and FNP student,"I am in clinical rotations as an NP and was wanting to buy a stethoscope with a longer neck so that I could have more to work with while assessing patients in the outpatient clincal setting. I was replacing my Littmann Cardiology II SE (a 16 yo stethoscope) with amazing acoustic qualities, but a very short neck. In comparision, I would say spend the extra money for the cardiology stethoscope it's worth it. I will be putting this one up for sale on Craigs list. I could hear a bruit with my old stethoscope that I could not appreciate with this one, and as a provider, that is not a good thing. If all you want is to make sure there is a heart in the thoracic cavity then this will do. Also FYI when you order a stethoscope it is NON-RETURNABLE which I didn't know so pick the one you really want. Not a fan of the 2147 master classic II."
3,Box issues,"Really good work marterial. Everything with the order was perfect, except the containing littman box that was practicaly destroyed. Im not sure what caused it, but the device was in perfect state so it wasnt a problem"
3,Very satisfactory .. but,"I bought this Littmann 2141 Master Classic II stethoscope after I lost mine after I did a thoracentesis procedure. But coming to the review of the stethoscope,Pros:1. Its Littmann. It looks good. It is comfortable.2. The ear pieces are very soft. They fit into the ear canals without any problem at all.3. Very decent to catch the sounds that we otherwise would have missed with cheaper ones.4. 3 years warranty5. Free shipping from Amazon (lolz)Cons:1. Costly for the service. ADC gives a higher 'Cardiology stethoscope' at the same price.2. Not recommended for Cardiology fellows. Its good but not the best one in the town.3. The rubber ring that holds the diaphram, to my amazement came off unprovoked.4. I donno why Littmann gives a damn about providing a name tag with the stethoscope. So an extra 5 bucks.The bottom line : If you wanna decent stethoscope to get along with your residency, go for it. Its not bad at all."
3,We negotiated a return,"Item missed manual and warranty: after negotiations, I am awaiting to receive payment to conclude a return and to complete a final review"
5,Littmann Stethoscope,Great stethoscope! Wish I had spent the money to have my name engraved. I've already left it somewhere! The sound is terrific.
5,Just love this!,"My best steth ever,,,great one for under $100. Have bought it at the start of my internship and think it would see me through my residency and fellowship..."
5,Best stethoscope,"This was a really good purchase, the quality of Littman can't be any better. If you are lookin for a durable and useful product, master classic II is 100% recommended. Also the black edition gives a touch of elegance really pretty."
5,Great!,Bought from amazon and wouldn't look back! The item came swiftly just as said and expected from amazon. The quality is Littmann...need you ask more? The stethoscope is great and it has quickly become one of my favorites and a contender against the master cardiology. Love the black and makes the entire stethoscope amazing and slick. The classic series is great and Littmann is the best. Don't hesitate.
5,Stethoscope,"This stethoscope is wonderfull, the quality is very very good, you can hear everything without effort!Linttmannn is a amazing choice for the people who work in the medical area."
4,Great Sound in a Heavy Package,"If you're an EMT-B, I, or P, this stethoscope is a step above what most people carry. A comparison of Littmann models on their website will show you how each model compares to the other. This model is rated an ""8"", which puts it above the sensitivity and clarity of the models most prehospital emergency care providers use. For a simple blood pressure, this is more stethoscope than you need. However, for breath sounds, cardiac sounds, and those blood pressures that are really challenging, you WILL notice the greater quality of this model. It has the tunable diaphragm, which makes it convenient to use. I like it and carry it with me every time I go out. The one drawback is its weight. It's solid. Heavy. And when you wear it around your neck, you feel it. It's not the most comfortable, and you won't find it pleasant to sling over your neck for hours at a time. If you can remove it between calls, though, you'll find it well worth it."
3,not what i expected,"It is difficult to pour the water into, the sides are narrow. The glass does not even have the number of cups on it and for a coffee pot that is suppose to be that much $ should at least have that. Its ok and only worth what I paid so I do not feel as if I received a great deal."
1,Don't buy this thing,unless you want to taste and smell plastic in your coffee. I bought it as a gift and returned it.
4,Well done satire. Intelligent and engaging.,Kingsly and Byrne are excellent in this biting satire that often turns to black comedy in an excellent commentary on modern high-powered wheeling and dealing in the corporate world. Twists and turns galore in a tightly woven plot that promises and delivers surprise after surprise in a wonderfuly written plot. Equally engaging is the sub-plot of Mr. and Mrs. anyone caught up in the aftermath of the duel between two media mogules (hence the title).An intelligent and engaging well writen movie for those who like to think about and be caught up in their entertainment.
4,Review of Bowen's Symposium,"Bowen offers a great edition of the Greek text designed for intermediate readers at a new-to-prose pace. His text is covered in helpful contextual as well as grammatical and vocabulary notes. His introduction succeeds at setting up the social and historical context of this work, and offers a short comparison with Plato's more famous counterpart.I have one complain--this entire series has the horrible habit of printing in courier font. I find it hideous."
3,Sociologically interesting,"This is a more naturalistic version of Plato's Symposium, invented by Xenophon.The ingredients are a copious meal and a drinking bout 'adorned' by a female acrobat. It all ends with a highly stimulating performance of the 'Dionysos and Ariadne' dance: 'Those who were not married swore that they would do it soon. Those who were, mounted on their horses and stormed home to enjoy their wives.'The discussions don't attain far and away the philosophical heights of Plato. They centre on perfume, dance, wine and courage. The participants are also asked of which feature they are most proud. The answers vary from wealth, poverty, beauty, friendship, literature and justice.Socrates explains his preference for spiritual love which never dies, whereas physical love passes away.This symposium is sociologically interesting because it gives a fair impression of the daily life of Greek citizens.Not a masterpiece."
5,looks good,I got this for my sis who is an intern and she was really delighted. She says it is very good.
3,A Doctor,"I have had 2 of these stethoscopes. I had the first one for 5 years or so before it got lost/stolen at work. I practice full-spectrum family medicine in rural Alaska. I liked the double-sided diaphragm gadget since it was useful for babies through adults. However, the diaphragm on the smaller side broke after a 1-2 years of use. I bought another one to replace the first and had the same problem with the smaller diaphragm breaking/becoming useless. Recently the rubber tubing broke and now I can't hear a thing. I've had it for about 3 years. I'm thinking of switching brands or maybe downgrading to a less expensive model for my next one."
5,Excellent,Item was in brand new condition and came in original box just like seller said! Great product for a great price. Would do business again.
2,I have a bootleg cardiology stethoscope that works better,Very disappointed for the $$$. Sound quality not as great as I thought it would be. The $50 Littmann works just as well.
1,rip-off,"Until recently i've got good deals with amazon. This time, however, i purchased a stethoscope that i believe have been repaired and sold as new. Close examination shows scratches on the material and the shine is gone. Furthermore, it is considered an item which can't be returned, which is the first for me. Future buyers, be informed."
5,cool colors. works great as any littman,cool colors. a little different from the black and stainless. works great as any littman I have used. no regrets
4,as described,"This was the highest and well rated stethoscope. i used to own one long time ago, I recollect it was built with better quality back a decade ago. This still works and better than the most."
1,Can't believe it has the Littmann name on it.,Could not be more disappointed with this item. I'm a nurse and have used many stethoscopes and this is the worst ever. Cannot even hear my own heartbeat with it. I suspect it is a faulty item so now I have the hassle of exchanging it because Amazon does not allow the return of this item. Would not order another stethoscope from Amazon after this. Update: Amazon is sending me a replacement at no charge. Thank you Amazon for making this exchange easy for me.
2,NOT BRIGHT BRASS FINISH,"THIS IS A SATIN BRASS PLATE, NOT BRIGHT BRASS. ADD SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR!!! NOT HAPPY! DOES NOT MATCH OTHER INSTALLED PLATES"
3,Powerful but sparse production.,"It may be important for you to know that this version does not contain Englsih subtitles. The staging is very sparse. The sound quality is excellent and the singers are powerful, but a libretto is necessary to study while you view."
4,Chicago Production Skills,"The Single Minded Pros bring together their unique and simple (in a good way) production with some excellent underground MCs on this album. My favorite tracks are Juice's - Dumb Hot, the Posse Track Who's F*ckin With This, Shabaam Sahdeeq's - Death Bells and Pacewon's - You Know It's Like That. If you like the Molemen or many Chicago MC's you'll probably like this album also. I just wish their would have been a track featuring Vakill on this."
5,Great CD-Set (very rare) Live in Holland,"One of a three CD-Box only released in Holland. Actually, this is not Clocks 3, but Clocks 2 !! Tracklistings: Clocks 1: Clocks (Edit), Politik/Shiver/Daylight (Live), Clocks 2: Clocks (Album Version), Trouble/The Scientist/Green Eyes-Mooie Ellebogen (Live), Clocks 3: Clocks/In My Place/Everything's Not Lost/Yellow (Live). All Live Tracks are recorded in Ahoy, 5 Nov. 2002 and especially Green Eyes/Mooie Ellebogen is very rare, because the song didn't go quite well (wrong chord) and it features Coldplay's only Dutch song :-)"
5,Eye-opening,"In the wake of the recent death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il there is probably no more important international documentary to watch now than ""Seoul Train"", an hour-long film from 2005. It follows three groups of people trying to escape North Korea, each meeting with different fates. What is most surprising, however, is to learn about the Chinese moves of repatriation for North Koreans who made it across the border.This is a chilling but highly informative film and should be seen by all who care about North Koreans and wonder what their collective fate is now that their longtime leader is dead and power is in uncertain hands. I highly recommend ""Seoul Train""."
1,Boring as can be.,"Every so often while listening to the local radio station I will wonder, ""Who is that singing and how did it get airplay?"" Well, this is what happened with Elisabeth Carlisle. I heard it and checked it out. They were playing it because she's a local. It was getting airplay as courtesy. Well, nowadays anybody can make a record and, if you're lucky, the local radio station will play it occasionally . . . as a courtesy. Sorry, but to me, it sucks!"
1,Uniden 5180 5.8 -Don't buy it.,"This Uniden 5.8 GHz phone is even worse than my 10-year old 900Mhz phone. I returned it the next day after trying a couple of phone calls. The reception is absolutely lousy, even if standing just outside the back door about 20-25 feet away from the base. Uniden should toss this model out along with its engineers who developed this phone."
1,This is a horrible phone,This phone is the worst I've ever seen. Bought it for more range. With my old phone I could go outside and get about 400 feet away and it would still work. This phone I couldn't even go in the other room without getting static or getting disconnect from the person I was talking to. It's just a very bad phone.
2,Bad Phone,"When I first bought this phone I was excited about it. It worked great except for the static when I walked outside. Two months later, the caller id and answering machine stopped working. The phone didn't even ring when I got a call. I called the customer service and they said I could send the phone back but would have to wait 3 weeks to get it back. If your looking for a resonable priced 5.8ghz phone with answeing machine, your looking in the wrong place. NOT A GOOD PHONE!"
2,"Disappointing range, ear-splitting dialing via headset!","Though originally pleased with this phone, I've grown to strongly dislike it. Let me first start with the good news:GOOD STUFF ABOUT THIS PHONE:- Easy to set up, including answering machine- Feels comfortable in my hand, against my head- Keys are easy to pressBAD STUFF ABOUT THIS PHONE:- The range is ABYSMAL! Even going from my bedroom to my living room in my small apartment with the phone results in tons of static.- When using a headset, the tones produced when dialing or using menus are so ridiculously loud, I think I've already damaged my hearing. What was Uniden thinking?! For those who still wish to get this phone... get a headset with a mute button!!!SO WHO SHOULD BUY THIS PHONE?- Folks on a very tight budget.- People with a one-room apartment.- Bedridden folks who never wander more than a few feet from the phone base."
1,The worst phone we've ever owned,"We liked the looks and the price, but the reception was never clear, even after hitting the channel/scan button 20 times. It was VERY frustrating, the loud static and constantly asking people to repeat themselves. Every day we said,"" WE HATE THIS PHONE!"" My husband works as a phone technician, so it isn't our line. I will certainly allow that we could've bought a lemon, we returned the phone for a full refund, so no harm done. My parents have the Motorola MD681 (they're very happy with it) and we just ordered that from Amazon for a good price with a $30 rebate through 12/31/04. If you only want to spend $60 on a 5.8 GHz phone, it's a risk, but you might get lucky like a previous reviewer. Good luck!!"
3,I wish I knew ???,"I would like to type a review for this phone but I am still waiting to receive it! It seems someone sent it, after I ordered and prepaid for it, to the wrong address and UPS then sent it back to amazon as undeliverable. That was yesterday but amazon still will not take the blame, they want ME to keep checking for reasons why I never received it!! This whole thing is sickening! Is this phone any good? I wish I knew."
1,"Don't Buy This Phone, Static, Bad Reception","I buy 3 all they have very bad recepcion even being near the Handsets,, a lot of static, the functions are a messdon't throw your money buy another phone !!!!"
3,it's just OK.,"Overall a good phone, well priced at $64. It's lightweight, easy to use and easy to program. Sound quality is good. Range is ok.However, we have experienced static and echo's several times when in use. The problem could be in the rural area we live. Either way, we returned the phone because it wasn't working for us. Bought the new GE 25893GE3 5.8 gh and haven't had any problems - it's a wonderful full featured phone. But it's about $30 more. The Uniden is still worth considering due to the features for the price."
2,worst. phone. ever.,"this phone seriously stinks. the ONLY redeeming factors are its ease of setup. the voice quality is horrible, and the range is the worst of any phone i've ever used. you may as well just buy a wired handset with a 100 foot cord."
4,LOVE these.,"The only reason I'm not giving these a 5 star is because my husband did manage to break one. He went over a curb and my heavy diaper bag bounced and broke one. But, they are great for diaper bags, shopping bags, purses, etc. A great shower gift!"
2,get a big 'D' ring from a home improvement store instead,"I kept buying these plastic hooks, hoping for the best. The first set were broken on a walk in cold weather (the plastic becomes very brittle in the cold) and the second set broke shortly thereafter. I went to a baby store and bought a big metal D type ring that has ""mommmy hook"" written on it and then went to Home Depot and saw the same thing without the writing for about 4 bucks less...wish that I'd have looked there first! The metal one works great."
1,this sucks,dont buy this piece of junk for that much money because it will break if you hook even one 3 pound bag! i give it 1 star because atleast i was able to save 1 out of 2 hooks just so i could hook my son's diaper bag!
3,Convenient . . . but have had two break.,Can't argue with the convenience of this item - it really helps. We have found they don't always fit our strollers well even though they have two sizes. They have broken easily as well.Convenient . . . but be prepared . . . they may break.
1,Invest in a different hook,"I purchased these hooks thinking they would be great for my shopping bags, but sadly they only got 2 uses before one broke. Concept was good, but material to hold items not durable enough. I would invest in the velcro hooks."
3,Not much of a revolution,"The basic information here is very helpful and could change your life for the better. That said, I was still disappointed with this book. It suffers from the same problem that so many nonfiction books seem to. It's got enough interesting and important information to fill a really good article, but that's about all. There's a lot of padding. The book also tells you a lot of stuff you've probably already heard, if you're at all interested in diet and health or if you have had blood sugar or candidiasis problems. I, personally, didn't find the cooking and eating suggestions all that revolutionary."
2,Old and very out of date travel video,"I have been to, spent time in and sailed through The Bahamas by private boat 14 times, the first over the winter of 1994-1995. I wanted a good DVD that I could use to show friends and family why I like the islands so much. This DVD is not what I was looking for. I think this DVD is a disk version of a very old and not well made, film, parts of it were out of date way back in 1994. If you like The Bahamas and can get this DVD for a buck, fine; but don't waste more than that on it."
4,difficult assembly,"Assembly took 5hrs and luckly we had the extra Tools that we needed! The reviews I read before I bought it were very accurate as far as assembly.Also the reviews about the Base were true,we noticed our base was cracked as we filled it with water.Other than those draw backs it is a great product,sturdy,and easy height adjustment.Hope this helps someone!"
4,Who I Read Now.,"Lucia Berlin's prose sneaks up on you and, with spare simple language, bowls you over. As with her two earlier collections from Black Sparrow, Berlin fills these stories with sad, yet inspiring characters living on or near the fringe of society. We get to see the lives of teachers and nurses, people we usually view only in the context of their work, up close and in alarming detail. Berlin is a joy to read."
5,DARKHORSE OF AMERICAN SHORT FICTION,"As in her other collections, Berlin writes to-the-bone truths in language so simple and clear you won't know what hit you. ""Where I Live Now"" is as deep and honest as an old scar; it will tempt you to keep sneaking glances at its lumpy form, imagining the pain that put it there - and the impossible healing of which we are all capable."
3,Informational but not necessarily a big help,"This book is quite large and not quite what I was hoping for. I already knew a few exercises and techniques but found some of the extra ones in this book were awkward and proved to be a waste of time.The book is quite touchy feely and doesn't excite you as you read. I don't know. You might enjoy it - I did learn some stuff from it, especially if you want to get right into the science of it all. Just didn't give me any improvement over my pre reading performance."
2,Over my head,"I am new at free diving and wanted a ""beginners book"". In my opinion, the is for intermediate divers as half the book was over my head with quite a bit of mathematics.( I returned the book with no problem)."
3,Manuel of freediving,"Everything that I Glanced at seemed very interesting, but I noticed there was alot of references to Yoga. Most people don't know that Yoga has a very strong tie to Hinduism,and as a Christian I personally don't want to be guided by its' principles. I,m sorry but that is how I feel. Thank you very much anyway."
5,Couldnt be happier,"Now, as Im sure youve read in all the other reviews, this is an instructional book!!! Not meant to entertain. Now, that being said, this book is simply incredible. It goes over every aspect of freediving, very well explained, and more thorough than you can imagine. Absolutely a MUST HAVE for anyone interested in the sport."
5,Awsome freedive material,This is quite possibly the most informative freediving material I have ever read. There are lots of good exercises and information you can use to improve your freedive skills.
5,The Only Manual for Freediving,This is it...the only book that describes the practice and the procedures to become a successful freediver. Apnea enthuisiasts will find a treasure trove of information here.
4,Good book,"It is a really good book with loads and loads of information and pictures. It is really a complete manual. however, for a beginner like me I found it difficult to understand most of the terminology used. I need to read more than once."
4,Book and software,"This ""book"" is basically a printed user's guide to the Quicken Willmaker Plus 2006 software, which is included on the accompanying CD-ROM. That is, you get the software itself and a thick printed guide, not a bad deal at all. The guide is actually more than just a manual; instead it gives you a lot of background information on property rights, wills, living wills, living trusts, estate planning, etc. I think this is a better bundle than the software itself which doesn't even come with a printed manual."
5,Another masterpiece from Per Olov Enquist,"You wouldn't think that a novel dealing with the rise of the Pentecostal movement in Sweden would be so gripping. But the cooperation and later clash of two larger-than-life men as they built the church in Stockholm from its humble beginnings on Azusa Street in Los Angeles to its position as a major competitor to the Lutheran state church in Sweden is true drama on an epic scale. And from Stockholm, Lewi Pethrus went on to spread his form of the gospel all around the world. (The Pentecostal church in Brazil now numbers over 30 million members.) This riveting yet also philosophical tale delves deep into the source of religious feeling in general, and is a worthy successor to Enquist's magnificent THE ROYAL PHYSICIAN'S VISIT. Both flawlessly translated by Tiina Nunnally."
4,"not as good as what I expected, but it is still a good choice","Positive: pretty light(not heavy), feel comfortable, and smoothNegative: still might be foggy at some point (but not often)"
4,Buena calidad,"Compré estos lentes para mi esposa, le gustaron mucho, al proncipio le costó un poco ajustarlos por lo que al principio se le empañaban un poco, sin embargo después de los ajustes fiuncionaron perfecto."
3,"Still some pain, not as bad as others","I've worn these a few times swimming 1-2 miles, and they don't hurt as bad as some other goggles I've owned, but they do start to dig in after about 500 yards. I like the amount of peripheral vision that they allow, and they don't seem to fog over that much, but the lack of comfort has steered me toward Speedo Women's Vanquisher Swim Goggles instead."
4,I like them,"I like the way they fit, but by the end of my swim, they seem to be stuck to my face. It sometimes hurts to take them off. Overall, I am happy with them"
2,Not anti-frog,"As I said in the title, it is not anti-frog!!!!Really not convenient...Have to buy a spray to do that...Cost is also high for a goggle..."
3,speed only,I distance swim(laps) so a comfortable goggle is a must. This goggle fits well but gets tighter as you pile on the laps. to the poingt that you need to stop and release the air behind them. These are not designed for distance. They are better suited for racing.
2,Watertight but painful,"I've had trouble finding a good pair of goggles for a narrow face. From the reviews I thought these might work. At first I thought they were wonderful. They are definitely the most watertight goggles I've ever had. But after about 30 or 40 minutes they got to be very painful on my face. I usually swim for about an hour and by the end of that time I had deep red circles around my eyes even with the straps fully extended. In doing more research I see that Speedo has three different ratings for their goggles: ""Competition,"" ""Performance"" and ""Active."" These are rated for Competition so are perhaps better suited for shorter workouts. ""Active"" are for recreational - vacations and such. I'm going to try a pair rated in the ""Performance"" category and see if they are more comfortable."
5,Excellent competitive goggle one caveat,"Excellent range of fit from children to adults. One caveat, the goggles (under water only) have a minus lens optical power. This works well for near sighted people and children. Normal sighted adults will be moderately blurred underwater only. I guess the engineers forgot to check the optics."
2,Goggles too small...,I didn't like the way the goggles fit at all on my head. I have another pair of goggles from another manufacturer that fit MUCH better. I figured Speedo would be the one to go with for anything swim related - but I would not recommend these...
5,Good purchase,These are great goggles they are as good as sweeds but don't leave marks. they stick to your head the same way. I have used mine in several Triathlons and they are so easy to use and adjust if needed.
1,SPEEDO SOCKET GOGGLES HORRIBLE!,Bought these thinking they were TOP of the line goggles. I swim nearly every day and needed a good pair of goggles as an hour + of laps require quality goggles. They were terrible! The nose strap is a cheap plastic which digs into the bridge of your nose (even when it's the right size)..the rim around the glass is a VERY cheap plastic- not comfortable at all to have on your face.I would rate these goggles and service a zero. They probably are worth .99 although i paid about $25.00 with shipping and the bummer is that they would not refund my $- only exchange.I would recommend TYR only! And try to buy them locally not online as you never know what you're going to get- especially when you have to pay for shipping 3 times!That's it..and just so you know- I'm usually a very positive person with a great outlook on life. I just don't appreciate being taken.Gail:)
4,Solid pair of goggles,"I love these goggles. I'm actually on my second pair -- my cat decided to chew threw the strap on my first pair.Everything about them is really solid. No leakage, good fog protection, and pretty comfortable. I gave them 4 stars because after around 45 minutes in the water they begin to get a bit uncomfortable on the face.Otherwise, I love them! If my cat decides to chew through these, I'd definitely buy another pair."
5,this is the best recording available of this piece.,"Zubin Mehta leaves most of the trumpet line interperatations to Phil Smith. If anybody knows how to play the lines of this work, it is Phil Smith. This recording has extremely exaggerated dinamics and tempo fluctuations. I was personally refferred to this recording by the brass players at new york phil. There is no recording currently available that even comes close to competing with the extremely high quality of this recording."
5,Can't stop listening to this one...,"I have listened to Mahler for 25 years now, and thought I was getting kind of tired of the Fifth. But I have found renewed awe of this Symphonywith this performance, and I can't stop listening to this recording. The second movement in particular is phenomenal in its turbulence, tumult, and range of emotion. The brass playing is extraordinary. (Do the strings play in the Finale's final chorale? Oh well, no reason to tear your ears away from brass playing like this anyway...)"
5,EXCELLENT,I have been through almost every brand of portable phone This phone is the best phone I have ever come across I have even left one in the rain and dropped it down a flight of stairs you know like a timex takes a liken & keeps on tiken.
3,One flaw -- Handset Speaker making weird noises,"I havent used the phone much, but in my testing, I found the handset speakers are making weird noises. The clarity of the phone seems to be not upto standard. But overall phone is good.But I tested both handset speakers and both have same problems.May be it has to do something with 2.4GHz frequency. If you have microwave, or wireless internet its possible you will get into this problem. But the phone is real cute and everything else is good. But me returning the phone :| Thanks."
5,Other nice features not mentioned elsewhere,"There are some other nice features that are not mentioned elsewhere:You can easily add a caller-ID entry into the phone book. This makes it easy to populate your phone-book over time as friends call.You can retrieve messages and perform other answering machine functions from the handsets.The handsets do not start ringing until the second ring of the call. This helps me a lot because I have a computer that hnags up on telelmarketers but can only do so after the caller-ID string shows up. It only appears during the first ring. With this system, I don't even have to hear a ring for rejected calls.The baby monitor function is clear as a bell. Every baby monitor I have owned is full of static pops and cracks."
4,Didn't need this phone system but it's one cool gadget,"This Uniden is my 16th cordless phone in the last 15 years. For most features it shines over all my older phones and has many more features. Like my 900mhz Sony these phones allow transfer of caller-ID numbers to phone book. The part I dislike is that numbers outside the local area do not have the 1 so the number has to be deleted and retyped with the 1. The Sony allows the 1 to be easily added. Other than that I am completely happy with this phone. It's clear and has a great range and the three phones work together well. The phone and answering machine are easier to setup than any other system I have had, so easy I didn't need the directions."
3,2 handsets but pack contains only one battery pack.,"hi, i got this ph from amazon.com,it works well But it comes with only one battery pack.the second handset is not provided with a battery pack tho amazon.com prouduct info and uniden manual,uniden representative confirmed it. The amazon .com customer service claim they only provide one in their boxes. I was suprised. Did any of the other reviewers go thro the same situation. Uniden is not ready to replace the battery as its sold from amazon.com and the warranty is lost once its sold from amazon. Ihave brought a lot from amazon and found their service always very good,i was a bit dissappointed this time around."
2,Berlitz Pocket Nor. - Engl.--Engl. - Nor. Dictionary,"This is a brief, bare-bones listing of equivalent, basic words in each language. It is OK for getting the approximate meaning of words (& by extension, sentences) in either language. Acceptable for tourists or casual readers, but NOT for serious translation."
4,Heavenly story telling,"Heaven, Indiana, is one of those books that you don't want to end. The characters are well developed and recognizable in any small town, and the suspenseful story is well crafted. I really wanted to find out more about each of the characters. I await the next book by Jan Maher. I hope she continues to create wonderfully rich characters who can teach us about some important issues of life in such an entertaining way."
5,Excellent,Great value from Amazon and the nicest dimmer in our home.3way set up is always difficult but with Google and the instructions I got it done in one shot.
4,So far no complaints,"Works as expected. The master and slave dimmers both have dimming switches, which makes it easier. For the price, the product is worth it."
4,Lasted Nine Years,"I have added a few of the Lutron dimmers to various parts of our house. The first was with this unit in our kitchen. After 9 years of use many times a day, the main switch finally gave out. In this day and age of cheaply made stuff, I consider 9 years of heavy use to be pretty solid. We have another six Lutron switches and have not yet had problems with any of the others. I originally bought them at my local big box store, but am happy I checked Amazon for my replacement as the price was much better. Having Amazon Prime meant I got my switch by the weekend, which made this little mini project go off without a hitch!"
2,"Loud, yes. Good, no.","I bought these speakers based on many recommendations I read around the Internet, most of which made reference to the amazing volume levels you can achieve. However, once I unpacked the system and tried playing some of my music files I immediately noticed two problems: First, the bass produced by the subwoofer is quite ""muddy,"" and makes the bass drums basically indistinguishable from bass guitar. Secondly, the satellite speakers have noticeable distortion in the midrange frequencies, so much so that I had to stop playing one particular song because I was getting headache from it.I eventually sent these back and picked up the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speakers and I've been very happy ever since. I don't know if the ProMedias can generate the sheer volume levels, but they definitely reproduce the audio much more accurately."
2,Don't buy,This company will set you back a bill; yet the quality is horrible. The bass is garbage at best with no way to turn it down to acceptable levels. Just a constant muddy sound. The remote is nice until it just stops working. Never again will I buy from this company. Will buy from anywhere but here.
4,Great speakers!,"I have had these speakers for several years, and they are still great. The sound quality has not changed since I took them out of the package. The only problem is the Bass. There is an adjustment on the control, but even on the lowest setting, still a bit too bassy. Fantastic speakers otherwise. If you get these just make sure you have an equalizer with your sound card or program you use to listen to music so you can turn the bass down lower if need be."
2,A scholarly review of the book,"I have read the many glowing comments from this site, but I see none given by biblical scholars (linguistics, philology, hermeneutics, etc.) or those trained beyond self-education of Scripture. Perhaps to balance the subjective reviews given here, another subjective but scholarly review is warranted to put BeDuhn's own bias in perspective? A google search should bring you to this nearly 100 page review of the book. There has been no conspiracy to manipulate the word of God or theology since the first century; there has only been a search for truth. BeDuhn is not immune to bias or his own hidden but evident theological beliefs that peek through the text. Given the above, let's see what a scholar of at least equal competence has to say about BeDuhn's claims.THE TRUTH ABOUTTRUTH IN TRANSLATIONA Review and Analysis byThomas A. Howe, Ph.D."
4,Amazing Greek Scripture Truths,"I found this book to be very interesting and quite surprising. I being the owner of a Emphatic Greek Diaglott published by, The Vatican Manuscript, being catholics who teach the trinity doctrine, noticed in the Greek Diaglott that John 1:1 is not translated in our bibles correctly. This author was correct in stating that the New World Translation published by Jehovah Witnesses was the only bible with the correct rendering of John 1:1. Jesus was clearly Gods son and not God himself. Being Begotten and the First Born of all Creation means Jesus had a beginning. Clearly the trinity is a doctorine derived from the worship of pagan Gods consisting of a triune going back all the way to ancient Babylon. I really hope this book can set the message straight and send people demanding answers from their ministers, pastors or priests.Amen"
4,Good Reference,"The book is well written and an easy read. The points he wants to make are clear and make sense. Those who want to make an issue of the way the NW comes out in this book are missing the point. He is NOT endorsing the NW as the ""best translation"". He is writing about the way bias can and in several cases has changed the meaning in Bible passages, thus making them inaccurate. Yes, the NW does have flaws and he points those out as well. This book isn't about bashing Jehovah's Witnesses, or any one else for that matter, no matter how fun it may be. Just because you don't agree with him doesn't make him wrong. It's classic human behavior ""It's different than what the rest of us do (or believe) so it must be wrong"". It doesn't make him right either, but the book IS a good tool for understanding and noticing how bias affects the accuracy of the translation. I suggest anyone interested in this topic should read it."
5,Beholden to none but the truth,"BeDuhn does not dance around theology, either popular or unique. Instead he drives the nails deep into the wood of Scripture, and on point after point he arrives at a beautiful bottom line: What does the Greek text really contain? How should it best be translated, and why? Where is the line between translation and interpretation?"
5,Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament,"Jason David BeDuhn shows an exceptional unbiased approach in comparing Bible translations to the oldest Koine Greek manuscripts. In spite of years of effort by translators to establish a ""core truth"" not found in the scriptures BeDuhn brushes aside their prejudice and sticks to the true meaning of the original autographs. Many theologians and so called scholars will not like BeDuhn's candid approach to revealing a blatant attempt by many translators to hide Bible truth from the Bible reading public. I applauded his honest and unbiased approach."
4,Truth in translation-great read.,"I liked this book because it exposes the bias that has creeped into all these tranlations. When the followers of these bibles are misled by the people they trust (bible tranlators) how many stumbling blocks will they be able to overcome before they just give up. I have never believed in the trinity because Jesus never even mentioned it one time and it just never made sense, so it is great to see John 1:1 explaned and backed up with clear evidence. I hope that many will read and enjoy this publication as much as I did."
3,Great stroller...but is it durable?,"I really like this stroller. It's easy to push and turns on a dime, and the baby is very comfortable in it.But, the outer rear wheels are wearing badly and this is causing the whole stroller to shake and sway. I'm not sure why this should be the case but I have a feeling that perhaps because the handle bars are not joined, the act of pushing the stroller causes the long vertical handles to splay and therefore cause the rear wheel arrays to ""toe in"" thus causing inordinate wear on the outer 2 wheels (they are ""cone"" shaped now).We have been using this stroller for 8 months now and to me it seems like we should not be having these problems.UPDATE January 2007. Added some photographs. View customer images."
1,value?,"I was very disappointed in this book, supposedly written by a professional, because most of the references to studies do not even mention the study or cite the studies he references. Without citation, the mention of studies is meaningless. One such comment that was repeatedly mentioned, without evidence, was that only fathers could teach their children math."
5,An Exciting Love Story,I loved this book. I just read it for the second time recently and I am surprised and amazed every time. If you like history mixed with romance you will love this book. It says so much in so few pages. The ending was a tear jerker once again and I found that I cried just as much the second time than I did the first. It is a great book and I would recommend anyone read it! It is a classic to me!
4,SURPRISED!!,"I've read most of these kind of books in the past. Its kinda slow in the beginng but there is so many twists, and u'll cry at the end! so sad, read it!!"
2,This book is lucky it gets 2 stars,"This book was dull and dry to say the least. The characters were so poorly developed it was hard to take any interest in them at all. The author made her best attempt of a plot twist, but was sadly foreseeable from a mile away. I love to read but I found myself not looking forward to picking this book again again. If your looking for adult literature you certainly will not find it here, this book is poorly executed young adult reading."
5,Hindenburg 1937,"Hindenburg 1937 is very intrigueing book. It's about an intelligent young girl named, Fraulein Anna Becker.She runs away from her brother's plans for her life because she wants to make a life for herself. So she board the Hindenburg. As Anna travels, she meets lots of interesting people and meets back up with her old love, Karl Mueller. He tricked Anna into spying on Erik Peterson, a man Anna had met and was interested in. Anna was also having feelings for the man she once loved. Anna must look inside her heart to find the truth about how she feels"
1,Get a life,"Creationism is a story made up to protect kids from the truth of their REAL heritage. WE ARE ANIMALS!! No better or worse from the pets we house, the animals we eat, enslave, or hunt. That does not make us dirty, it should make us feel a kinship with our cousins from the animal kingdom (along with plants, fungi, bacteria, and protists). Why are humans so egocentric when it comes to our origens. The world in not 6,000 years old, we are not special, and our self-centered elistist Christian ideals will be the death of our civilization. Get over yourself!!"
4,Watch out for the price!!!,"The price for each remastered CD included on this box is now $9.97...there are 8CDs in the box...so the price must be less than $80...but...NO!!! it's $123!!!! Buying them separately you'll save more than $43!!! Nonsense!!!I give it 4 star for the content, but obviously 0 stars for the price!!!"
3,Nice but something is missing,"The box is very nice and I agree with other positive comments on Amazon. However, I want to stress my deception in seeing that ""1984 - For the love of big brother"" is NOT included in the box. It is a wonderful album (released under a different label) and certainly I expected to find it in such a collection.Another missing point is: lyrics. At the time, all vynil LPs included printed lyrics, while now in the CD jacket there is just a leaflet with photos and historical comments."
2,"....Blah,","Shame On Stewart.!....90% filler..10% ok..They had years to get it right, But overall the box set is a boring failure.Stew..let go & let a REAL CD producer get it right 10 yrs from now.!"
4,Go!! GO!! Go!!,I love it-Jessica is my dance teacher at West Sylvan and I LOVE HER!The cd is so much fun!! Thank you!
1,My FIRST and LAST Dell printer,"I have been a long time, and very satisfied, user of Dell PC's and laptops. The 1710 was my first Dell printer.Out of the box the first one failed. Would not print. All five status lights blinking; LONG time on the phone with India following the standard script. Unable to resolve. Dell sent a replacement printer.The replacement one worked for a few weeks, then the very same problem. Dell sent another replacment.Eight months later the same problem; yet another replacement.Nine months later the fourth one failed with the same identical problem. Out of warranty now. This one is going to the dump. It is the last Dell printer i will ever buy"
3,interesting but doesn't read fluently,"This book contains a lot of interesting information concerning Fela Kuti(family background, historical, cultural and political environment) but sometimes I had the distinct feeling I was reading a scientific research report. A little more fluency in writing would have made reading more enjoyable"
3,Good;not great,"I enjoyed this book,for one,because i love legal thrillers.I rate it as good,not great because it never got really going as far as the courtroom drama of other authors in this genre.I especially think they need to add a warning in their synopsis of graphic sexual scenes.I really don't enjoy having to fast-forward through that stuff. i wouldn't have purchased this book if i had known about it.I don't think i will buy any more books from this auhor for that reason.you may consider me a prude if you wish;but i just don't think graphic sex scenes need to be in the book for it to be good."
4,Good with modifications,"As has been pointed out in other reviews of Champion goals, the velcro ties that come with the product will break easily if hit with any force. The solution is obtain a box of ball bungies for about $5/box at your home improvement store and substitute at the critical points where the ball could hit. With this mod, the goal is good."
1,NOT Comprehensively Clarice Cliff,"This book is huge, heavy and looks like a great source of information on Clarice Cliff. But there is a BIG problem - the title is wrong! It is not a ""comprehensive"" listing of her patterns and shapes as the cover implies, but those produced by the A J Wilkinson factory between 1910 and 1964. It has endless pages of pottery by John Butler a little known designer who worked at the factory from 1910-1930, and also obscure floral patterns by Clarice Cliff's sister Dolly. It also includes many printed patterns whereas every Clarice collector seeks her hand-painted ware. A collector who knows more about this than I do went through the patterns and found 40% of those listed are not by Clarice herself. Also, nearly all the images were supplied by an auction house, so it looks just like an auction catlogue, NOT an art pottery book. I have nearly all the Clarice Cliff books and this was the most expensive and least informative."
3,Colorful reference resource,"I am a US collector of Clarice Cliff and was very much looking forward to this book. The positive: you can find almost any pattern and the dates they were designed and fired. If you need to find a pattern or shape, it should be in this bookThe negative: Difficult to discerne the valuable from the run-of-the mill. The color photos are excellent and the application of paint comes alive on many of the objects. There is some controversy whether all the designs listed are really Clarice's. But after reading so many books about her and since she was so reticent about giving information, it is more difficult to argue who designed what and when.I use the book as a reference, not as a guide for what is the collectible. Since I believe CC's work is very hard to find in the states, it does serve as large enough range if I should ever come across a piece I must have!"
2,"Big and pretty, but missing lots of material","When I first got the book, I thought it was the ultimate, but after finally getting through it and analyzing it I find there are about 40 missing designs. I guess it is still pretty but NOT the ultimate."
5,great target,"Have hit this target over 200 times now with copper plated Winchester 22 long rifle fired from Ruger MarkIII 22/45 from 10 to 15 yards, with NO dents and NO damage. Instructions state to use lead bullets only but I have had no problems with copper plated from a pistol. Fired from a rifle may be a problem and cause dents because of increased speed and energy, I can't attest to this because I have not shot it with a rifle. You do have to have the angle set right or it won't work properly. Also have had a few strays and hit the legs and braces, knocked paint off and that's all, no damage or dents. Excellent product!"
2,Huge disappointment,"I'm a huge fun of P.E. I've been listing to them for years but I'm not really digging this live album, the live band it's actually killing all the classics I miss the old P.E. live shows, I'm not digging the P.E. Band. If you are a true fan get it like I did but if you're checking P.E. for the first time, stay away from this record."
1,Unfortunately I'm not able to praise this product,"I purchased this product because I was absolutely tired of buying cheap lightbulbs literally weekly because the filament in the bulbs were so fragile. I live in a 60 year old house and for some reason these particular lightbulbs lasted slightly longer than those I had been buying at the dollar store. Yes having a bulb last two months is better than two weeks. What made these bulbs worse than the dollar store brand was the fact they had the propensity to explode. All six of the bulbs purchased blew out on average within two months of being used with two exploding. Does it have anything to do with my house? Quite possibly. My home is old however I had never had any bulbs, no matter how much or little I spent on them, explode until using this brand. I went back to using the dollar store brand so when they blew out there were no shattering of glass casings. So it goes without saying I can't praise this product at all."
1,huge mistake,"Do not buy this. The 40gb hard drive and the ""features"" mask the true quality of this product. The firmware is terrible. Folder and filenames only show the first 5 characters, making it hard to find anything. The pause/play button does not always work when listening to music. Folder and file navigation is way too slow. The volume on this thing is extremely weak. Video conversion software that is included does not work (winXP & WME9). Seems to me that the manufacturer tried to make it as cheap and as quickly as possible. It's a good idea, it's just that they should have spent more time tweaking it. If you have the money for one of these things, save another $100 and buy a video iPOD.P.S. - Anyone know if the PVR firmware is linux based?"
3,"OK for the basic use I intend, cheap. Bulky, not very smart, washed screen.","I just needed a mean to backup and review photos during a long trip I am about to take. It will definitely serve this purpose. I just hope that it will endure the trip (looking at the external construction I have doubts about its quality).On the other hand, there are some shortcomings:- It will not display RAW files (I knew this before I bought it). But the thing is that it will not even show them as files that can't be displayed, but can be listed and copied to a new location.- It is bulky.- The screen colors are much washed. It will not show the real colors.- I can zoom once into a photo. When I try to zoom again the unit freezes.I have not used, and do not plan to use, music and video recording or playback."
1,Don't waste your $,"I'm sorry for those who wish to sell their used unit, but I'm also a user of this product, or should I say USE TO BE. For those who are interested in purchasing....buy something usefull.Once the battery fails, it's useless. You can't replace it. The only way is to send the entire unit back to Mustek and you're at their mercy as to the price for the battery and shipping costs. Do you really want to frustrate yourself???????The only good thing about the unit is the fair video quality. The sound is tinney, low volume (even on high).Even though there's no speaker (connect earphones), the San Disk Sansa is the best bang for the buck!"
3,some what pleased,"I really liked the product stands for, but there were problems that I guess are internal problems with the machine. I have purchased this device several times and each time there was a different problem with the machine. After I loaded about 35 movies on the device, it wouldn't cut on. Once the machine wouldn't cut off, so I had to reset the devise, which I lost all of my movies. I think if there were more products like this, it could really be a good device, because it was good for travel and you don't have to take a portable DVD player and movies with you. I really like the devise, it just had too many problems for me. I would love to have another one, but I have purchased too many and returned too many, so I don't want to keep getting the devise, only to have to return it and keep paying for shipping fees for manufacture problems."
1,Yuk!,"I didn't like this at all...it is really hard to use, has confusing operations, it feels really cheap, and the picture quality leaves ALOT to be desired. Stay away from this one..."
1,"Bad quality, worse client service","I bought this product and after 15 days of use, the item doesnt work anymore. Then I noticed that the warranty only applies in USA and Canada and I live in Mexico. I wrote to support and customer service in order to repair it, even if I had to pay for that, and I never received any answer.So I just put my money in the trash when purchasing this product. If you dont live in USA or Canada I strongly recommend you NOT to waste your money and time."
1,do not waste your money,"This is not worth a penny.Terible battery life, terrible audio quality, and even worse workmanship. The buttons on mine dissapeared inside the unit and have been waiting for 2 months now for Mustek to fix this under warranty. I give this minus 500 stars.Do not waste your money. 1 star is way to good for this."
3,Lazy cat likes it,"My baby is very a lazy, non-frisky, over-affectionate type of cat. She's not old or fat, just lazy. Her idea of exercise is to squirm around on her back while humans pet her tummy. She completely ignored this thing at first, but after a few minutes she started playing with it when I held it directly over her head. She still prefers sleeping to da bird. But she'll happily try to grab for it (and she tries to eat the feathers) as long as I hold it right next to her. She usually goes back to ignoring it after a couple of minutes. This is more success than I've had with any other toy. I did see the earlier reviews about the fiberglass on the stick - I've been holding the stick with a cloth or heavy duty rubber glove."
4,"Fantastic toy for cats, but....","My two cats went NUTS over this toy. I have bought several cat toys but this IS the ultimate. I wish the feathers were more plush as the replacements aren't cheap. My cats wore them out within a week. Maybe I should not have left them lying around for them to chew on. Also the safety pin type mechanism which lets you replace the feathered end got stuck within a week, and won't work. I will have to figure out another way to replace them. My cats LOVE this toy though."
5,Best Cat Toy Ever,"I got this after Seeing Jackson Galaxy with his toy and his 'problem' clients.. i LOVE this toy. I have one cat who absolutely Adores this toy.. the feathers flutter as you swing the wand back and forth.. to a cat it looks just like a bird would (I would think).. my other cat likes it and is interested.. as long as it's on the ground .. the other two.. aren't interested.. yet, but it's hard for them to get in the action due to the very dominant others."
5,This is great!,My cats love this! It sounds like a bird while in the air and the long pole and string keep the toy away from the hands so you don't get scratched while playing.
5,We've never seen our cat act like this!,"The toy arrived yesterday. It has an extra long, flexible poll, which is really nice. At first we were a little bummed that the toy didn't have a noise maker on it, like a bell. But with the first swipe through the air our cat perked up! It is designed to look and sound like a bird's wings in flight -- no bells necessary! He jumped, chased, and pounced for almost an hour, and was still looking for the toy when we put it away (it tired us out)! He even started making these growling noises we've never heard before! He treated it like a real bird. Our kitty is a hunter!After a long and vigorous play session the bird is still in great shape -- so so far it seems durable. We are happy we bought it. A+"
3,"cat loves it, but it splinters!!","My cat absolutely LOVES this toy. I have to keep it in a closet and any time I walk anywhere near the closet she runs to the door, meowing and pawing for me to get it out and play. She runs, jumps, somersaults, leaps and flips to catch this thing. HOWEVER. When we were playing tonight I felt something sharp pinch my thumb, I looked and didn't see anything and put the toy away without much more thought. As I was preparing to write this review, however, I see that someone else discovered that the fiberglass pole splinters, causing harm to the person, and many other reviews on other websites have reported the same thing. Bella is going to be so sad!!"
4,Amazing,"My cats love this toy -- especially my youngest, Mouse, and my female, Meggie. Mouse, in particular, has become obsessed with it. After playing, he constantly attempts to get to it himself, where I've stored it.The toy's amazing. What makes it special and unique from other fishing-pole toys, is the design. The feathers on the attachment are stiff and crafted so that, when the pole is swung, the attachment actually moves as though it's a genuine, flying bird. It even makes a soft flapping sound. In fact, our budgie even thinks it's another bird, and chirps loudly when she sees it fly by.My only gripe (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the string gets wrapped around the pole pretty often. Not a huge deal, though.Anyway, highly recommended for cats and their human families."
4,Da Bird Toy,"My cat absolutely went crazy over this toy. However, after about a couple of weeks, he got bored and uninterested. I plan to put it away for awhile and take it out again. But I think all cats will love this toy."
5,#1 TOY FOR CATS!!!,"Are you constantly searching for a toy your cat will love? Give this one a try! My one year old cat loves to play and I find myself constantly looking for new things to entertain her. This was it! We got the toy two days ago and she went after 'da bird' immediately. She has only had 4 play-sessions with the toy so far and now I have a new problem...she won't move away from the closet when I put the toy away! Also, be sure and buy the toy that comes with a few replacement birdies, I have a feeling 'da bird' is not going to last very long once the cat gets it alone."
5,The ultimate cat toy,"I have never seen a toy that cats cannot resist and never tire of, besides this one. I keep having to reorder because they loved the refills to pieces."
5,Best Cat Toy...EVER!,"BUY THIS! Over the last 15 years we have had 5 cats (no more than 3 at a time---I am NOT the crazy cat lady...yet). We have bought catnip toys, chew toys, lasers, dancers, ect. But, they love, I mean LOVE, this toy! They go CRAZY! When we play with it we play tug-of-war, they growl, try to walk away with it and jump higher then we have ever seen. When we are not playing with it they are dragging it around the house, cuddling and sleeping with it. We had to replace the feathers after 2 days because they had chewed/eaten them. They are not too keen on any other attachments, just the feathers.Additionally, we bought this toy to welcome a new 7 month old. He and our 6 year old girl seem to get along well together when they play with this toy together! Da Bird has brought our cats together!!! BUY THIS!!!!!"
4,Cats favorite,This toy has been a blessing for my 1yr old cat and my uncles 14 year old cat's relationship. I have 2 other cats that will have nothing to do with it..they hate feathers..weird! 1 of the replacement feathers was defective so therefore the 4 star. Ordered 12 more from amazon because this is by far the best cat toy I have ever purchased! Thank you! =^..^=
3,The String Doesn't Hold Up,"This is the second ""Da Bird"" I've owned. This is by far my cats' favorite toy. My female cat is so crazy about it she stands over it and mews begging me to play with it, and she does soaring back flips in mid air trying to catch it. My previous Da Bird was the two-piece design but the coupling finally broke for good and I was unable to repair it, so I was happy to find a one-piece design. Unfortunately, it also suffers from the same glaring problem, the string is simply not durable enough. My cats tore the string within minutes of introducing it to them. Like my previous experience, I wound up replacing the string with heavy gauge fishing line, which holds up much better"
2,"My cat loves it, but the string is awful!","Okay, so if my cat was reviewing this toy, he'd give it 10 stars, super fun & he loves it. However, after less than 2 weeks of use, the string is all bunched up on itself and won't straighten out. After just a couple swings back and forth it goes from about 3 feet length of string to about 1 foot, all curled up on itself. I need to figure out how to replace the string and still keep it attached. Very disappointing."
4,Da Bird Value Pack,"Cats do like chasing the feathers, but the feathers detach readily. The value pack is the way to go."
1,VERY poorly made toy,"A $10 cat toy with $7 refills (my local price, or amazon + shipping) should last more than 24 hours. The stupid toy is MEANT to be pounced on and chewed, why isn't it made to tolerate that? One of four feathers came off it as we took it out of the package, the other 3 were gone by next morning. MAJOR rip-off!"
5,A Classic!!,"The cats absolutely love this product (and no substitutions, no cheaper ""off brand"" versions, will do!!). You used to get a three-pack of feathers with each pole you bought, and the refill packs would always have three separate set of feathers, AND the feather-packs used to be at least three fairly long, sturdy feathers glued together. Hopefully they won't cut any more from the quantity/quality of the feather part of their product, because I think that's what makes it so much better than other brands or versions of it!!"
5,da bird toy is great,my cat loves this toy.the da bird pole pole is much longer than another pole i was using- the da bird pole is much better.I can flick the bird very easily (no pun intended)da bird feather toy actually turns as it travels thru the air whivh adds more excitement for my cat. my cat has chewed on the feathers and the fathers have withstood the punishment
3,One major flaw to anotherwise fun product,"I like to use this to play with my kittens every few days... It makes them really happy and it's a great way to tire them out.The one flaw that I have is that the end always gets tangled up and when you're bopping it/swinging it it gets twisted and flips over, which messes up the gravity and makes it not as, well, fun and chaseable. If you keep moving it without stopping to detangle it, it will tangle up around the tip very quickly and you'll be left with no string.I don't know if there's a way to fix that problem, but it does bother me quite a bit... And my kittens greatly dislike having to wait for me to detangle it every 30 seconds!"
5,Cats go nuts over Da Bird,"My cats just weren't interested in their old toys anymore, so I decided I was going to follow Pam Johnson-Bennett's recommendations. I am absolutely glad I did. I think I actually had one of these before but was probably put off by the cost. Not really sure why, since I pamper my cats, I guess I didn't want another toy in the box they weren't interested in. Well they absolutely love the 'fluttering bird stuck in the house'. I think one of my girls actually pants from over exertion! If they hear the 'flutter' they all wake up and come running to capture Da Bird. I'm glad I purchased the value pack with two extra 'birds'. I will definitely need them! I highly recommend this toy. Even an outdoor cat would enjoy this immensely!"
5,My cats love this toy!,This toy is one of the best items I have ever bought for my cats. They're pretty finicky and they haven't taken to other toys or cat items. This toy they love. They both perk up whenever I bring it out and are willing to play with each other during this time (they typically stay as far away from each other as possible). They love the noise it makes in the air which is supposed to mimic the sound of a bird flying.I recommend putting it away in the closet because the cats will destroy the bird attachment fairly quickly. They love tearing it to pieces on its own. I also recommend getting the value pack since I've already had to attach a replacement feather and it's only been about 2 months since my purchase. (This might be because I didn't put it in the closet.)I have no regrets and I will be always purchasing this toy for my cats and any future cats that come into my life.
1,NOT the Original Da Bird,"We have a full house when it comes to felines, so we have purchased numerous Da Birds for at least the past 10 years. In May 2010, we purchased a new Da Bird and noticed the design is completely different from the Original Da Bird. In the original design, the feather was a ball-chain connect and the handle was one long, heavy piece of plastic. The new design uses what looks like a fishing lure (which is very sharp and I had to cover it with duct tape), and the handle is in two pieces, which separates, thin and flimsy. The feather no longer flutters like a bird, but merely soars through the air. It's obvious from my review that I am displeased with the design changes. I will now be on a mission to find a different bird toy that is sturdy and emulates a flying, fluttering bird. Sorry Da Bird, this feline lover has flown the coop..."
2,Great toy but quality is not as good as before,"Da Bird is my cat's favorite toy. She can play with it many times a day and never gets tired of it, which of course is not the case for other toys. However, my most recent purchase has a bad string that tangles up after a few swings. We need to pause our play and spend a minute or two to get the string straight again. Then repeat this after another few seconds of play.Comparing this string with our old one, I can see that they are made from different materials. The new one looks cheap. I am not sure if all Da Birds have this problem or just the ones from my seller. I am searching for a replacement string in craft/sports stores but have not found a good one yet."
5,kitty crack,"normally i reserve reviews for products where additional information helps resolve uncertainty, but this product is already well reviewed and highly praised. but i nevertheless decided to write one. my cat is addicted to this toy and would probably trade me for more play time. while flying through the air it rotates to give it an even more lifelike appearance. no other toy or activity is as much fun to her and she looks around the whole apartment for it after i've put it away."
1,Splinters! Ouch!,"My cats loved this toy. My 12 year old Siamese was excited to see the latest version of his favorite plaything, but after 15 minutes the shaft shattered and my daughter was left with fiberglass splinters in her fingers. Very hard to remove. This toy needs to be redesigned or taken off the market. There is no excuse for it failing in this manner."
5,It's crack for cats,"My cat goes crazy for this toy. I get tired of playing before she does. I seen the toy on the show ""my cat from hell"" and thought I'd give it a try cause my cat runs crazy at night. I play with her for thirty mins to an hr and she sleeps through the night. If you have a very active cat I recommend this toy."
5,Fun for all!,"This cat toy puts all other cat toys to shame! In fact, I kinda feel like I wasted my money on all the other cat toys I've purchased! Immediately 3 of my cats were entranced from the kitten to the 3 year old who usually doesn't move much. I had been trying to avoid buying this toy because it is slightly more expensive than others, but its tremendously better, and worth every penny!"
5,5 stars ! Purrrfect thank you,"We are huge fans of this cat toy , and the refills are a must . This has been a favorite of our cats for over a year ."
2,Book Never Arrived,Ordered the book late August. Book never arrived. Company says they will refund my money. Will have to find book somewhere else.
3,Arrived with a damaged corner,"The desk itself is nice and inexpensive but it came damaged on one corner. I did not notice this until I had unpackaged the desk and was then impossible to repack and send for replacement. As long as your desk doesn't become damaged in the warehouse or via transportation, you'll have a good desk for the price."
2,Very childish,"This book was extremely childish. Having read it cover to cover, I felt that I wasted my money, as I was looking for something that had a reasonable amount of biographical information. Perhaps the mistake was mine in not reading reviews more closely. I have a 13-year-old granddaughter to whom I will be giving this book; however, I suspect it will be well below her age level, as well."
5,Great for middle school,"I am a middle school math teacher and I read chapters from this book to my students. Mathematics can seem so abstract and the stories of real mathematicians adds flesh to the topic. Both women and men are in the book, which allow me to demonstrate that women can excel in math and the sciences. My students ask me to read stories. I guess that means they recommend the book.The stories tell about not only some of the amazing things these great people did, but also contains anecdotes that show their humanness. Newton was forgetful. Noerter's students at Bryn Mawr protected her from traffic. Students develop strong opinions on Sophie Germain's wisdom at staying up at night to study mathematics, in an unheated room in the winter. Were her parents really watching out for her? Notable historic events are woven into the stories, such as the burning of the library in Alexandria.These are human stories for anyone who is a teen or older. (The chapter on Galois bummed out my students.)"
4,Comfortable and quality.,"You get what you pay for and I'm satisfied with this purchase. It fluffs up fine, not too soft, and not too firm."
1,Fell flat,"I bought this pillow after seeing great reviews and such, but I was not impressed. The first night I slept on it, I woke in the middle of the night and found it had flattened and my head was pretty much sitting on the mattress. I wound up putting my arm under the pillow and making it through the night but my neck was achy the next morning. Not worth the high price in my opinion."
5,"Heaven arrived, doubled down!","Love love love!!!!!!! I will be buying a feather bed, feather bed protector, and comforter from Pacific Coast as well! I just wanted to make sure the pillows were everything they advertised and they are!!! After a long not so good day, I went to bed early, my roommate came in and said you've got a big package downstairs. We opened the box, took the pillows out, and they fluffed up on their own. Sleeping on these pillows is simply luxurious!"
5,Pacific Coast Pillow,"For years I've been sleeping on ""bargain"" pillows. I looked for the least expensive ones and then couldn't understand why I had a hard time sleeping. My Pacific Coast pillow has been a pleasurable experience for me. I can't believe the difference. I plan to pick up another soon."
4,Review of this Product,I like what I received very much. So far it has been a comfortable pillow. I wish that I had purchased two of this pillow and I still may do that. I also received this product in a prompt manner.
5,Outststandingly Comfortable Pillow!!!,"Finally, a very comfortable pillow which supports my head and helps give me a great night's sleep. After a few ""pillow failures/disappointments"" from various sellers, I decided to take a chance and try just one more pillow. I love this pillow, my wife loves it too so now we are going to purchase several more for our bedroom and the guests bedrooms."
3,There are better for cheaper.,"If you like this you might as well get the z by malouf shredded Natural Talalay latex with gelled microfiber that feels similar but better. It also is a lot cheaper.Z by Malouf Shredded 100% Natural Talalay Latex with Gelled Microfiber Pillow, QUEEN"
3,Not the same as Marriott,"Slept on some great pillows in a Marriott last year, looked at the tag to find Pacific Coast, bought two from their Hotel Collection, but they are noticeably less comfortable than the Marriott pillows, even after 10 months of breaking in and several hundred thread-count cases. Feathers are coming out too. 3 stars only because they're still better than other down pillows I've had, but I want the best! Maybe Marriott will sell me one of their's next time."
2,"PILLOW GOES FLAT, MOSTLY FEATHERS","I was dissapointed when I received this pillow, it goes nearly completely flat when you lay on it, and doesn't support you.Also it feels very crunchy and the feathers poke you. Not the quality I'm used to, or expected."
5,double down around pillow,"Who would think finding a really good pillow would be so difficult!!!! I have tried multiple brands of pillows and have been disappointed over and over. I kept using my old, broken (yes pillows can be broken!) pillow until I read reviews for the Pacific Coast Double Down pillow. This pillow is excellent!! It is firm enough to support my head but soft enough to provide real comfort. With a simple shake; it fluffs right back up every morning. Love it!"
2,"Very informative about ""the liberal agenda""","If you ever wondered about why liberals behave the way they do, or advocate big government, then this book is a must read. The book describes history in light of ""social justice"". Social justice is defined as redistribution of wealth and political power from those that have it to those that do not. History is defined by deviding it into those periods in which progress was made in redistributing the wealth and power, and those periods when progress in those areas were not made. Anything towards that end is described as good, and vise versa. In my humble opinion, this book is scary and should be a must read by everyone who plans on going into a voting booth. The book gives you a clear idea of why liberals want bigger and bigger government and ever increasing taxes, but directly from their game plan/text book."
1,Well written propaganda.,"The author does a good job going through each presidency. What brilliance! He started in the past and led up to the present (I'm making fun of the first editorial review which lauded the author for the ""time-sequence"" structure of the outline. That was for another edition (but I've got this edition).My only gripe about it is that the author finds no redeeming qualities in conservative presidents, and paints liberal presidents as tormented angels...even LBJ."
3,"Not bad, but there's a better book","Normally I recommend any book in the ""How to Rock Climb"" series but the drawings of the knots in this book are not so easy to see as in another knot book: ""Knots and Ropes for Climbers."""
4,Concise carry along book,"Excellent book for bringing along to the rock and practicing with friends.It is thin enough to fit alongside your guide book in your pack.It is concise enough so you don't get lost in lots of reading.It covers all the knots I use and a few more.Of course, you should practice the knots before you go up the rock."
5,Best Book on Knots,"I've read knot books by other authors and this is definitely the ""BEST."" I highly recommend this book!!!!!!!!!! It is well organized and easy to follow. All relevant knots are discussed with clear, concise, and easy to follow directions. Illustrations are very clear. Appropriate usage situations for each knot are discussed. I've read other books by Craig Luebben (Rock Climbing: Mastering Basic Skills and How to Ice Climb) and those were great as well."
1,Weak.,"When I heard there was a biography on Kate Moss coming out, I could not wait, especially since this book received so much hype about how much it revealed.Please! First of all, this is a very small book, just shy over 100 pages of actual writing. The rest of the pages are poor quality B&W; pictures, and a huge section in the back of ""notes,"" and a bibliography.After finishing this book in one sitting, I had learned nothing new about Kate Moss. Every bit of information in this book is taken from old interviews Kate, Johnny Depp, and others, had done for different magazines.I think this book was a waste of money, and is not worth it at all, not even for a die-hard fan."
2,pretty good for a book report...,my english teacher would give this an A if the assignment was to solely gather info from magazines. But where are the 1st person interviews? the author could have been way more resorceful! there are hundreds of people she could have interviewed to make this a stellar best seller it deserves to be. Kate Moss inspired a generation of young people. This book inspires nothing.
2,Title should have been- Kate's Ex Boyfriend,"This book should be called ""Johnny Depp"" because it is more about her relationship with him than about herself. I expected a biography on her life but it's about how this super-waif got famous and then those who made her famous turned against her. Then the rest of the book was about her unhappy relationship with Johnny Depp. I really like Kate Moss and would like to have read a book about her...not her ex-boyfriend."
1,just not a very good book,"my friends and i just chose this for our monthly fashion-oriented book club (we've previously enjoyed easily appropriate selections like ""the devil wears prada"", etc.) and were unanimously disapointed (they all are about to write their own reviews here, though). maybe this could be good for someone who isn't already a Kate fan, or has never heard such things about models doing drugs or being too skinny - like people who live in a bio-sphere or something. i guess i just expected more indepth info - like, how about a FREAKIN' INTERVIEW WITH KATE HERSELF! - from an author who ran ""the web's most popular Kate Moss site"" for like 5 years. some ""fan""!"
2,mediocre at best,"My friends and I just read this as part of our new ""Fashion-Group Book Club""...I didn't dislike it as much as they did, but it does give one reason to marvel at how much completely unspectacular writing and recycled bollocks make it to publication. It even came to us recommended so I'm surprised at how just-not-good it is. Even the pictures, the best part, are all ones I swear I've seen a million times before. So, if you're looking for photos of Kate, I remember a book that came out on her in the nineties, a lot more expensive of course, but that one was excellent. ""Model of Imperfection"": not recommended!"
2,so-so story of iconic model,"my friends all just read this and we're all disappointed in it, maybe someone who knows less about kate moss would get more from it. it IS articulate and factual, and it's not that it's BAD writing, it just didn't give us anything new to talk about. i wish there were other biographies - even if totally sensationalized! - about kate moss out there!my recommendation? maybe a good beach-time or bus-ride read, but don't expect anything revealing."
3,ok,"Kate Moss: Model of Imperfection is an ok book.While interesting, you don't really know Kate after completing the book."
5,Best book on Rasta beliefs,JAH has blessed this Rasta Empress to bring forth these chapters. All Rastafari love this book about Rasta history and beliefs. There is a more recent edition published in 2001 with a new chapter about White Rastas. This book should be read by all interested in knowing about Rastafari from the source. PRAISE & BLESSINGS
3,Wallpaper,Looks a bit like wallpaper. There is gold running through it that I wasn't very thrilled about.
4,Fine product,Fine Product. Reasonable Price. But forget the Free Wireless Optical Mouse that comes up after you register the product. It's a trap and you will find yourself signed up for s $20.00 per month billing even if you never activate the account or use it. I am surprised Belkin would be a part of something like this.
3,"It works, but it ain't Belkin brand","The cable I received is thinner than I expected, and doesn't say Belkin on the cable itself (usually printed on the cable jacket) - but it works well and that's what matters"
3,computer needed some adjustments,"computer needed adjustments after insalling this product, easy enough to do if you are computer literate. Screen is almost like it was with factory cable."
1,Cable Failed on startup,"Looks like a grea quality made cable. This one is not.My VGA monitor screen indicates ""no cable connection"" when turned on, computer was off.A proper display is shown when the computer is on but the no cable connected box remains on when the computer is shut down.I dont have that problem with the orginal cable used.Not worth the postage to return."
1,Shaky Image,"The image provided when connecting a Dell Inspiron 8200 to a Sony 23"" LCD HDTV was ""shaky."" In the end, a similar cable (though 6' instead of 10') from Radio Shack worked well."
4,"Bubbly, quizzy fun","A humorous book on the first season of the Emmy Award winning TV show. No you are not going back to school. This book is entertaining and fun. Test your knowledge of the ""Friends"" and get a rating of How good a FRIEND you are."
2,"Truly Dreadfull DVD, Great Ladies, Bad Editing","I was so dissapointed with this DVD. First off, of all the great comics mentioned to be on this DVD there are as many hideous ones, and here is the catch, sometimes they only have 3-4 minutes of the stand ups routines, like with Judy Tenuta, but include all of the horrible comics routines like Jenny Jones and Morgan Fairchild. All of these clips were filmed in the early to mid nineties and are all performances from Evening At The Improv. If you are a die hard fan of these ladies and really must own everything on DVD, then buy this, otherwise you are much better off just buying their individual stand up routines. The dvd advertises that its uncensored, but here is the catch, all the appearances were filmed for TV, so they are already all censored. Im sorry I bought this collection. I dont want you to be too. Lastly, this ""4 hour"" set is only 3 hours and 20 min. Each DVD is only 40 min long. SOOOO BAD"
1,access denied,From margaretcho.com:Margaret Cho did not intentionally give her permission to be included in this Funny Ladies DVD. We are trying to find out if this was done illegally. She is not being compensated.
4,"Worth Reading, Worth Buying & Worth Finding","Now that this book is now out of print, I want to assert that this is by far and wide not a poor book by accomplished crime author Lawrence Block. Originally published under the pseudonym Paul Kavanagh, just like the first Kavanagh SUCH MEN ARE DANGEROUS, Block exceeds the reader's expectations in the unique creation of a taut, tense and memorable novel about a hired political assassin who falls in love with a girl who proves that his actions are very very wrong. The plan is to overthrow the current US government through careful manipulation of the general public through murder after murder of high-profile political figures representing all causes and extremes. Dorn's cruel calculating violence is a marvel to behold, and so are counter-reactions in the public and political spheres. A tragic figure in tragic times. A very powerful novel. If it isn't in print - find it!"
2,A work of Lawrence Block that shows his early years,"This is an interestng, but in my opinion, poorly written tale by Lawrence Block. In this novel, Block is too obsessed with dialogue. That is the only way the story is told. Instead of the rich extra thinkings of the hero that we usually get from Block, this character is only seen through his speech, giving us an unclear view of what could be a great, tragic figure. Otherwise, the story is interesting. All in all, if I could have known him better, maybe Miles Dorn would have deserved the title evil."
2,Lady Campbell is at it again!,Yes Lady Campbell is at it again! I believe that the poor woman was eaten up with envy and jealousy toward this young woman!I believed after reading 'The Real Diana' also by Campbell that Campbellhas a real screw loose in her head!Diana paid a big price for standing up to her spoiled selfish husband didn't she?
4,groovy,It was a powerfull book. Follows the wonderfull strength and mystery that always surounds conan of cimmeria. All the conan books make great stocking stuffers for your book worms...
5,Christmas Concertos,"The Christmas concerto is an interesting subgenre of the baroque concerto grosso. Several Italian baroque composers wrote concerti designated for performance at Christmastime - this designation being by virtue of their pastoral or ""musette""movements, such music being associated with the music of the sheperds of Bethlehem. Here Il Giardino Armonico performs a batch of Christmas concertos by Corelli, Vivaldi, Gemignani, and others. Giardino's astringent tone lacks the sweetness of Europa Galante (my preferred Italian period instrument ensemble), but their interpretations are bracing, sometimes startling in their dynamic contrasts, and full of life. They are, if you will, like a severe German alterpiece rather than a sweet Italian madonna."
1,Dangerous Recipes,"I am completely outraged that a book like this can enter the marketplace. SEVERAL of her recipes are lye heavy and the soap made WILL burn the skin. She instructs the reader to use massive quantities of certain essential oils, such a cassia that are known to be caustic on the skin. The author obviously has not ever used the soap she's instructing to make. If she had, she would be red, raw and probably blistered. What a shame, so many will be injured by using a soap book."
1,Strange book,"I bought this book to learn. Well, what I learned was this book stinks. There are many empty pages, it seems like most of her soaps are the same base soap and just switch the additives (fragances, etc) and the section about how to turn soapmaking into a busness was a farce. I didn't want to hear about what she went through, I was hoping for information on who to talk to, where to go for licensing, or anything remotely related. None of that was here. A list of suppliers or something would have helped also."
1,Not alot of variation,"I Bought this book hoping to learn some new recipes. Most of the recipes in this book are based on two main recipes. The only difference is the fragrances used. I was hoping to get alot more different base recipes. It's a small book for as much as it costs. I do like the fact that it is spiral bound, but I don't think it is worth the money I paid for it."
1,Horrible Book!,"UGH!! Can't believe I spent my $$ on this book! Cheesy, single side pages, one basic recipe for soap, no help on selling my stuff, WASTE OF $$ AND TIME!!!!"
1,Not worth your money,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. I have few soap making books that cost less or about the same that give better value, information and picture. If you are thinking of making profit from soap, this book doesn't help either."
1,Truly appalling,"Dangerous recipes - well, one recipe with a multitude of minor variations, dangerous instructions. Total lack of proof-reading. The only good use for this book is as an emergency substitute for toilet paper."
1,Very disappointing!,"I found it to be highly overpriced for the content. There are no color pictures and all the recipes require lye! Each to his own, but I prefer a more natural safe approach when it comes to soap."
5,One of Stark's Best,Back flash is one of Richard Stark's best stride. It has plenty of action and suspense. Parker is his usual competent best. The heist in Backflash is ingenious and the cast of characters is intriguing. Highly recommended.
4,Fast Paced Gambling Ship Robbery,"An anti-gambling long time civil servant is obsessed that New York State is going to allow a four month trial run for a gambling ship the will cruise the Hudson River between Albany and Poughkeepsie. Parker,the neo-hero, puts together a group of interesting thieves to rob the ship while it is in transit. The entire plot and its characters are quite well done. The book moves along at a good clip. It is a good, enjoyable quick read."
3,A satisfying read...,"This was my first Richard Stark book and it was worth the money. Parker's gritty, matter-of-fact way of looking at life and doing things made for an interesting character. And the way Stark tells the story, you feel as if you're an eaves-dropper to events going on -- in other words, you feel as if you're there. I appreciated the fact that Parker had a good side, as well as the bad. But Parker didn't let the good side take over his common sense when his life was at stake. He does what has to be done, like it or not. In sum, the plot was good and believable. The actions and events that unfolded were interesting, well-thought out and plausible, and the characters seemed real. The book had just enough action and suspense to keep your interest, and a good enough story to tie it all together. The book gets my recommendation."
5,An excellent little resource,"James MacKay provides you with a brief history of the tartan, and then goes on to include several of these tartans, ranging from very early tartans of the highlands to newer commemorative tartans.My personal problem was that my family is not a clan and falls under one or more clans, and I'm not sure which would be the appropriate tartan to wear. You can't hold the author responsible, but if you are doing some family history research you may encounter the same problem. So you may have to do some independent study to find out which clan you belong to.But even with my personal problem aside, it is an excellent resource and has something to teach about Scottish history."
4,Another great tartan resource,Another great tartan resource. It is a great addition to your library and for taking with you to Highland Games. If you run an information table items like this are a must have.
5,Delightful history of Maine family life,"Charles Asbury Stephens clearly had an interesting life. He lived with his grandfather (the Old Squire of the neighborhood) in Maine when the world was very different. They worked hard and were industrious and entepreneurial. The teens staying at the Old Squire's place were they to work hard and learn, but of course mischeif and humor were part of the bargain.Stephens writes in retrospect, in a less than choesive way, giving us vignettes of life during one year. Somehow the lack of cohesion does not detract. His experiences were delightful and I am glad to have been taken on the journey of that year with him.I would compare Stephens with Ralph Moody (Little Britches, et al), giving them both very high marks."
3,A lot of good examples,"I enjoyed this book -- the photos and many examples were good. However, I felt the patches were too much alike: all centered around a center patch. I wish there had been more ""craziness."""
5,An intelligent and innovative novel.,"The best written and most ironical and intelligent novel I've read recently. Reflexions on writing, fiction vs reality, life and time are brought together in a new narrative discourse calling for a new type of reader. Javier Marias is by far one of the best Spanish narrative writers today."
3,La novela de la novela,"Una narración interesante sobre el proceso de gestación de ""Todas las almas"", una de sus mejores novelas. Conocemos aquí las fuentes de documentación que empleó, sus andanzas para conseguir datos fiables, sus peleas literarias y cinematográficas y varias anécdotas sobre el mundillo cultural madrileño. La novela puede parecer atrayente por el reconocido estilo de Marías, por su maestría en la narración, por su demorada sintaxis, que revela a un gran fabulador, pero el argumento resulta totalmente anodino e intrascendente, y únicamente a los ""entendidos"" en esos mundillos les puede gratificar su lectura. Ciertamente, esta metanovela no ha conseguido ser una novela. Sólo para mitómanos de Javier Marías."
3,And OK book,"Perhaps the book's biggest flaw is it's length in comparison to its content. My focus was mainly on the contemporary Russia - for it's the period I am more confident of. Regardless, Hosking seems to advocate for some right wing theories regarding the centralization of the Bolshevik state, at times giving some objective insight, and at times taking a personal stance in the issues.It's not the best Russian history book out there, not close to it. It's perhaps a good approach, a good beginning to understand the foundations of the Russian society and their culture, but I would not regard it as a magnificent work.Hosking seems to have done his homework. His research shows a lot of work and a lot of dedication. However, I see this book's legacy as a bit dubious, for the target it wants to reach doesn't match with the book's content."
3,Cracking due to Poor design,"I've had two of these and both crack and break at the same place. There's a ""bow-tie"" sort of clip. The plast casing that holds on to the bow-tie cracks and breaks. The cover then falls off too easily. Otherwise, a good product. Just poor product design."
5,Still Planning on Learning How to Play a Guitar,Well this product has videos of how to play the songs compared to just sheet music.
3,StarTech 2 Port PCI USB 2.0 Card,"This unit was easy to install like any plug-in PCI bus module but I had a problem installing the software. There wasn't any real documentation and I did not find any help on the StarTech website. I was using Windows XP SP 1 and kept getting error messages saying I needed to update Windows XP. Finally, the light went on with me and I started to search around the Microsoft web sight for the appropiate plug-in software. I found there was an update to SP1 called ""SP1A"" (perhaps SP2 would taken care of it, too). Anyhow, with the right version of XP, the software loaded just fine and the card works properly."
1,Absolute Trash,"This card is junk, plain and simple. Do not buy it. It continually crashes my Win2K Pro machine whenever I try to plug my iPod in. (The iPod works perfectly on my laptop.) You might save $5-10, but you'll waste hours trying to get this to work. Every other review I've seen on it rated it as low as possible. I'd rate 0 stars if amazon would let me."
4,Excellent but what's with the cover?,"Having been raised in one of the remote barangays in one of the remote provinces in Philippines, went to college in the city, and currently living in the U.S., I can relate to most of the things discussed in this book and how foreigners react to them. I still find our culture fascinating and I wouldn't hesitate to explain this to a foreigner who's interested to listen. But why the choice for the cover? Wouldn't it be nice if you put a picture of a 'bayanihan' or a child giving a 'mano po' to an elderly, instead of a man in white mask with a San Miguel Beer and a cigarette in hand? I know 'Sinulog' in Cebu, 'Dinagyang' in Iloilo, and 'Ati-ati' in Aklan, but these festivals do not reflect the 'culture shock' that's discussed in the book. It might give an impression that there's a lot of 'voo-doo' practitioners in the Phillipines. Ok..ok...let's not judge the book by it's cover...Excellent reading for your 'Americanized' kid or your American in-law."
5,Great book for understanding the culture of a Filipino,I married a lady from the Philippines and this book would have made both our lives much easier if I had it then. Live and learn everyday.
1,This book ain't nothing but trash!,"Truthfully, I wouldn't even give it a 1 star! This stuff ain't true about us new breed of Filipinos. This book is a bit outdated. Don't even read it!Just for example about the opening of present issue. It may be true to some but not all of us. And so does any other country. This is not a very helpful book."
2,Substitutions are not always acceptable.,I am not completely sure that the tea I received was in fact Lipton's Red Rose tea. The box containing the tea said Canadian Red Rose tea. Is this product the same tea produced by Lipton?Why is the box different from the pictured product? Why is the taste different?
1,Hard to understand,"My eighth grade students had difficulty understanding the dialogue. In particular, there was one presenter that I had difficulty understanding even though I teach this topic in World History. I had to strain my ears to make out what he was saying.I would not have used this particular person to present information orally. I'm not sure whether is was an accent or just a peculiar speech pattern."
1,A Guide To Line Dancing,I was disappointed with this DVD. I think it was made from a tape and it was very grainy and hard to follow visually.
2,so?,"Having read this book cover to cover, it's the sort of thing written by someone who probably has thought a great deal about these issues, but not actually managed development teams in a while. All the other reviews aren't wrong, they just don't get at the fact that very little in this book can be put to actual use. It's too intellectual, too academic. Where it almost seems to offer something tangible, it in fact is only offering carefully thought out frameworks. Unfortunately, frameworks in todays world are relatively cheap and as plentiful as there are relatively intelligent minds. More useful for a practitioner would be a book offering checklists of specific actions. As far as why I have a right to say that? I manage several teams of developers, churning out real code daily. The author is an academic who hasn't managed major teams in awhile and it shows."
1,Definitely not an instructional video...,"I completely agree w/ the other reviewer. Buy this video if you want to just watch 2 experts dance. One cannot learn how to dance any of the dances indicated on the dvd cover. My fiance and I have been taking rumba, waltz & tango classes and wanted to spice up our steps a bit. Even for folks like us who know the basic step, this video was nooooo help at all and extremely fast paced :("
1,Strictly not instructional,"If you are looking for music to listen to, or to watch a pair of dancers this is the ballroom dancing dvd and cd for you. If however, you actually hope to learn ballroom dancing steps, please look elsewhere..."
1,Complete waste of money!,"I agree with everyone else: We had taken a beginners' ballroom dance class and just wanted a little refresher, a literally step-by-step instructional video, and that's what the cover of this DVD seems to promise. It was a total waste. If it were possible to give a zero-star rating, I'd have done it. Amazon should scratch it from their catalogue."
5,A generous sharing of an enlightened and earthy writer.,"This book is a rare one that must be read to understand its various qualities that take the reader into the realms of childhood friendships,family dynamics,relationships with the land, the solitude of rural life, the poetry of language, the detail of observation, and the spirit of living. It is one of the great books of the new century."
3,high reading level for a picture book,"I'm an elementary music teacher who bought this book to share with my classes. It is a beautifully illustrated book, but the reading level is a bit advanced for a picture book. I found myself having to explain every page because it was written in such a idomatic, abstract way, with advanced sentence structure and vocabulary. The themes were a little grown up too: his Godfather was an executioner? The page about World War 1 was almost cryptic the way it was written. I had to read it twice to my 4th and 5th graders before they had even a slight idea what it was talking about. For my K through 3 students I found myself mostly summerizing and paraphrasing everything to keep from having to explain all the time. This book LOOKS child-friendly, but the writing style is definitely NOT."
4,Well Done!,"I would give it 5-stars had there been no music in the background. However, after a while you tune it out. I like the reader. He's not the standard celebrity reader or the usual pompous, deep voice reader. I read several reviews citing his speaking style being an issue. I like it. He is American, yet he reads like a Shakespearean trained actor. Therefore, there is a lot of drama and inflection in his reading. To me, it seems to make more pharses pop out and demand to be noticed. I think its the best Bibical audio I've ever heard, and I would love and OT version with this reader....just ditch the music."
5,Totally Awesome,Israel and New Breed did their thing in this video. I felt as if I was a part of the worship and they were totally awesome in bring the spirit in my home.
5,Amazing Worship Experience!,"If you are looking for a true worship experience from a DVD then this is it! There is something to be said about true worship in a land that GOD inhabits. The music, the atmosphere, the people were all in unison in the worship experience. Get this DVD and open your heart and mind to the presence of God through song and ministry.Enjoy!!"
5,South Africa will never be the same!,"I cant say how blessed I am to have purchased this item. Israel and New Breed are annointed and gifted, and they have blessed millions around the world, but the experience in South Africa is hard to put into words.Songs such as Alpha & Omega, Not Forgotten, I Will, and featuring Jonathan Butler was a true treat. In addition to the DVD, I had to get the cd so I can hear the music whereever I am!"
5,She understands the Fair Folk and Elizabethan England,"A marvelously gritty and precise picture of London under Elizabeth I, and a complex and compelling mystery story involving a rare woman member of the Stationer's Guild whose child may be the answer to the battles between the Seelie and Unseelie Courts of Faerie. Lisa Goldstein gets it just about perfect. Also see her exquisite story in Sandman: Book of Dreams."
2,Strange Devices of the Sun and Moon,"I note the positive reviews and blurbs all over the cover, but I didn't think much of this book.The Faerie Folk have come to Elizabethan London, bringing problems in their wake, especially for Christopher Marlowe and for Alice, whose son turns out to be a changeling.I found the language use here to be a bit mundane, meaning that a mood was never really developed. Plot events jolted from one to the next, without a sense of flow. Characters, especially secondary characters, seemed faceless and lacking in personality.I was bored, therefore, and cannot recommend the book."
4,One track that I keep returning to: Needle Mythology,"I love to sing harmony, so much so that I rarely listen to the words I'm mumbling. The rest of the album is very good, but listen to how many licks there are in this tune (and how natural this odd progression is). Sad song, but catchy enough to have my five-year old confusedly singing these words.Sample this song!"
5,Great wooden puzzle set for great price,"Personally love sets like this, that have four puzzles in one. Perfect difficulty and subject matter for my three year old son who loves all things farm. Pieces fit well together and can be assembled on the lid of the storage box."
4,durable suit,Good quality construction on this suit. It is snug without binding and great for swimming in competition or training! Hard to beat the price too!
3,Too Late,"I cannot really review the quality of the product. We needed to have them by a certain date, and they came too late for us to use them (later than the latest projected arrival date). Too bad. We had to purchase some somewhere else and send these ones back."
1,"No such thing as ""native astrology""","Sorry, but anyone native will tell you the whole premise of this book is ludicrous. Plains tribes didn't keep calendars, so why would they have astrology? Astrology is a European thing, not native. Sun Bear, Wabun Bear, and their cult the so-called ""Bear Tribe"" are not respected among native people because of stunts like this, making up fantasies to exploit whites who are honestly seeking out native spirituality. If you want a truthful view of native religion, try Vine Deloria's God Is Red or any of his other great books. Go to a powwow or take an anthropology course. But don't fall for silliness like this. You will be angry and disappointed and no closer to understanding native cultures."
1,Sun Bear of questionable character,"I went to a workshop of his and Wabun's in the early 80's at Ananda Ashram in NY. He took me and my friend, both of us college students, into the woods for a walk. we sat down and he got on top of my friend. He wanted to give her some of his peaceful essence. We pushed him off and ran away. We told people, but no one believed us."
2,Your life is NOT set in stone,"I did not care for this book.This book implies that your life is set based on the time of your birth. This is nonsence.You may have traits that you find yourself following out of habit, but you do not have to follow them.If you have the desire, and the will to change your life you can!I am living proof of that statement. This is why I use the natural name Two Bears (to remind me of the two very different people I have been in my life).If you have questions or comments E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda"
5,Vintage Chicago Buildings,Good Product Description prior to buying the Book. Good Mailing Package from Dealer.The Book is a very good read.
4,Psychology of Gender Textbook,"The book arrived on time. It had a few bumps around the outside but no biggie. The previous owner had highlighted some thing, but I actually like this!"
4,Nice is not a crime,"Back in the early 70's, McCartney's output was unfairly criticised because he was seen as the man who broke up the Beatles, and then spent his life being a happy family man, instead of a headline grabbing world trotter like Lennon. Due to this, his early albums (up to and including Red Rose...) were unfairly attacked. This is still seen in the critisism of his early records today. Allthough it must be said that 'Ram' has gotten a lot of positive press in later years. As Lennon turned out to be an uninspired solo artist, Harrison kept making the same album over and over, and Ringo... Well, the novelty wore off. McCartney finally conqoured the World in his own right, with Band On The Run.The prevailing sense of what was hip and what was not in 1971/72 should not keep us from enjoying, in 2007, what is an album of fine, and at times great pop songs. If nothing else, this is a historical first recording, from one of the 70's greatest bands, The Wings."
3,Ignore the rock-crit groupthink...,"""Wild Life"" has tended to get some rough treatment in the music press. It's Wings' debut album, yes, it's patchy, and overall the performances don't touch what Wings did later on when they really got it together, but the familiar McCartney melodic genius is dependably present (on the beautiful ""Tomorrow"" most especially). So is his generosity of spirit (""Dear Friend"") in the face of withering attacks against his character from critics and ex-bandmates alike. It couldn't have been easy being Paul and Linda McCartney in the early '70s, yet they showed true grace under pressure. ""Wild Life"" is definitely worth owning. Never mind the haters; just enjoy a modest little album that speaks of new beginnings, musical and personal."
2,new band releases practice tape,"Once in a while a glimpse of a melody shines through the mix of half-baked ideas and lousy production, as in ""Tomorrow"" and ""Some People Never Know"". Quickly, though these glimmers are ham-fisted into submission by the neophyte band of seasoned professionals, packaged and released for public consumption, just in time for a tour. Why should we care? Because it's Paul, ex of The Beatles. The only reason to buy this album is to place all other albums by McCartney (and most other humans) into perspective. Shite, to be sure, but the bonus tracks are fun."
4,McCartney's Wild Life Great LP for lovers,"I owned this LP and found, in the context of the times, early '70's, it to be charming, passionate, light-hearted, and fun. Some albums serve quite well to provide a back-drop for people in love, and this is something, if you are a Beatle or Macca fan, you can put on and set a great mood for getting to know each other better. It has a great flow to it and some great sing-a-longs. Some People Never Know is a great apology song which deserves recognition. I won't go on about each song, but allow me to observe that if this a half-baked effort, with second-rate songs, as some have said, then McCartney is so talented to be able to make such a very good LP out of inferior materials. An LP you can listen to over and over again."
5,Wings!!!,"Though this LP never got off the ground, it's still a good LP for every McCartney fan. For those who are first time listeners, Paul will not disappoint you. ""LONG LIVE PAUL""!!!!!"
1,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH,"I don't know how anyone can rate this album highly. I've been a McCartney booster for years, and own a lot of his work, but this is almost unlistenable.In summary-- the songs sound unfinished, the playing is tentative and the recording is low-fi. McCartney had said he wanted something spontaneous and while a great idea in principle, it works better if the band has played together for some time.I give this album a star because of two extras-- 'Give Ireland Back To The Irish' and 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' are surely McCartney's most controversial tracks, and are essential listening to any real fans of the great man's work."
3,My Personal Wild Memories,"This is the first Paul McCartney album with his new band Wings after the split of the Beatles.Most of the material was written by Paul and Linda McCartney; A lightweight album, yet very interesting and full of good memories, especially for the hardcore PM. Fans;As far as I am concerned (growing up listening to this album), my personal rating is 5 Stars; however a 3 star for the average PM fan should be more appropriate.Should you buy this album or not?Difficult to answer."
5,Hands down,"Ask anyone who knows me, I spend WAY too much time playing this game, thinking/talking about it, running servers, tweaking the UT system files, etc. When I first saw it on a friends system in 1999, I knew I had to not only play it, but master it. Still working on that! There is no end to the directions this game series can take you in. It is definetely hands down the greatest (PC or otherwise) game, ever, period. The fact that it's open source is icing on the cake, and has greatly contributed to UT's diversity and quality. Have I mentioned that I'm pretty fond of it? Get it. Play it."
2,Homing With The Birds,"I love this auther, but this book was too detailed about hunting and photographing the birds and did not have much of a story line. I would not recomend it for anyone but the most avid bird watchers. I like the other works of the auther much better. She is a good story teller."
4,breathing mechanics,One of the few that teaches breathing mechanics for each form.Recommend Grandmaster Chen's DVD to accompany the book.
2,Some books are for collection only,"Chen is a great master, but this book is not worth to be read. Buy it to keep the line starting with Yang Chengfu and to honor Grandmaster Chen, but dont try to learn Taijiquan out of this paper."
2,Good Topics Bad Quality of The Images,Second EditionPositives-> Good TopicsNegatives-> Very Hard to see the radiographic patterns particularly on plain radiographsDiscussions are too general in occasionsWould not buy it again if I had the chance.
2,Disappointed,The images are almost impossible to make out. The text repetitively makes references to images not included. The discussions are too general for boards and there is a surprising lack of differentials provided. Would not buy again.
3,bootcamp elite,"okay i use taebo workouts about 4 days per week. ive been doing taebo videos for about a year now, so mission 1 is too easy for me. i like mission 2. billy and the team uses billy bands during the workout but i use free weights. i never like using the bands because they bother me. but the workout is just as good using free weights. i am not too crazy about mission 3 which is an ab workout. i dont think its challenging enough. however, if you are more of a beginner, these workouts are good for you. dont be alarmed by the word ""elite"", if you are a beginner, these workouts might be a little more of a challenge for you, but its most likely something you can handle or work up to."
4,Infocus LP70+,"I am actually shopping now for a replacement bulb for this unit now, which I have owned for 10 years. This is the first bulb I have had to buy for the unit as well. It has been a remarkable projector for a very long time. It is also quite versatile in regards to inputs. I have connected computers/laptops, dvd players, cable TV boxes, as well as video games such as PS2 all to the projector. The picture quality however, depends on the source not the projector. The image is crystal from a computer input but, very unclear with the PS2(lowest scale). Hope it help, even though it is very outdated they are reliable units which can be bought for very cheap now. Mine was $1800 new in 2000 and now they go for around $500."
2,This thing will heat your whole house and everything in it,"I bought the 402b because it has HDMI switching, lots of input options, and hightly rated sound output. I also bought it because I have had a JVC audio system for 15 years and love it.The good part of the receiver is it's great specifications and HDMI support. The bad part is that it that the hardware is poorly executed. It is inexcusable to put out a product that becomes too hot to touch after half an hour of use at normal sound volumes. JVC apparently thinks it's some kind of crime to put cooling fans in receivers. As a result, you get a box that is cool to the touch in standby, and so hot that you literally can't touch the top after half an hour of use. I had to drill extra holes in the back of my entertainment center, and am now out looking for a PC fan that I can run along side it.I would be surprised if I don't have a different receiver within the month.If you live in Alaska, go for it. Otherwise, I'd shop around."
4,Overall very cost effective,"JVC is the only company currently making affordable HDMI compatible receivers, and the ports work quite well. The DVD player looks crisp and the sound is perfect. However, it wouldn't work properly with my Motorolla DVR cable box. There are as someone mentioned HDCP issues. Seems to be because the HDMI port doesn't open on the reciever until after it senses signal coming in and the cable box won't enable decoding unless the unit is open to receive. The sound is crisp paired with 7 KLH TW-08 speakers, video works perfectly. Best of all since it syncs HD video and audio there is no more need to switch both your TVs inputs and find its proper audio source on your home theater. The star loss is for the issues with the cable box. Other than that, its solid."
4,Not just a coffee table book,"I was expecting just that, a coffee table book with minimal insights on the techniques and thoughts behind the images, but not so. This is a decent book for just browsing through gorgeous images from games or the concept art behind them, but for a practising artist, it is probably more interesting to get nuggets of wisdom from the artists responsible. Don't expect any tutorials, wireframes, WIP shots and the like, but none the less there is interesting information in those interviews, which might just teach you a few new tricks or give you a few ideas for your own work. It did me."
2,Nothing special,"This is just a passive 8-way splitter, nothing special about it. For $28 shipped it's a little pricey for doing very little. After I bought this I found a passive 8-way splitter for about $8 at the local hardware store, talk about buyer's remorse..On top of that, after using this for a few months, I realized I needed to get an amplifier when splitting the signal up more than 2 ways (as will most people - the signal strength gets divided by the number of ways it is split). I have an amplifier at the antenna but I guess that wasn't enough. So I ended up getting an amplified splitter, which splits 8 ways but also amplifies as it is doing it so that you don't need another box in the video closet.The amplified splitter cost forty bucks and provides a lot more value. This unit seems like it should cost about ten bucks (painted sheet metal plus 9 x F connectors), so I find it hard to recommend it as a great buy for twenty eight bucks shipped."
2,Wilson undermined by his instrument,"The problem with this recording is not so much the quality of Glen Wilson's playing, but rather the instrument he is playing on- in this case, a harpsichord from 1985, which has a very harsh, metallic sound that is fairly unpleasant to the ear. It sounds like a really bad electronic synthesizer, and effectively negates any enjoyment one might receive from this album. If you enjoy Scarlatti on the harpsichord, seek out instead Christophe Rousset on Decca, Bob Van Asperen on EMI, or, if you can find it, Trevor Pinnock on Archiv. For Scarlatti on the piano, I reccomend Ivo Pogorelich on Deutsche Grammophon, Andras Schiff on Hungarton, Mikhail Pletnev on Virgin Classics, Joanna MacGregor on Collins, and of course, anything by Vladimir Horowitz."
5,Best oil I've tasted outside of Liguria,"This oil is so fruity and delicious, I could drink it. I use a cheaper brand for cooking, because I read somewhere, maybe it was on the Carli site, that this oil can get a little bitter when heated, but it is perfect for drizzling and dunking. A good piece of Ciabatta or Pugliese and this oil, what more does a person need? Heaven can't be better. Try their olives, they're in the same oil and you cannot stop eating them."
2,"Not ""fruity"" tasting","I bought 6 bottles of the 17 oz bottles at a reasonable price. I was hoping for oil that has that fruity olive taste. This brand did not. I will use it for sauteing, but not on salads."
5,A very pleasant music of the mature Haendel.,"In this Oratorio I feel a kind of sadnes. I don't find the author of the italian operas, that conquered London. But I find a deeper sorrow, a certain melacholy. But is always the great Haendel that we well know. Harnoncourt feel perfectlyu the atmosphere of this work. The singers are good or very good. Expecially wonderful are the choir and the orchestra."
5,Truthful advertising,"These cells state a 2700mah capacity. But since cell capacities are frequently overstated for competitive reasons, one should always measure the effective capacity in your application. In my application, I expect a 400ma constant current drain. So I charged 4 cells and then discharged them at 400ma and recorded the capacities. They were quite uniform, which alone speaks to the quality of the cells, and had an average capacity of 2450mah. Yes, that's less than the 2700mah rating, but that rating is usually a 10 hour discharge rating. That is, at 270ma constant drain, the cells will take 10 hours to reach terminal voltage. So 2450mah at a 6 hour discharge rate tells me that Sanyo is justified in claiming 2700mah capacity. And there are lots of cells out there for which this is not true (like SunPak)."
5,Not all batteries are created equal--these beat the pack,"I recently purchased a digital camera with an excellent reputation, save for its long recycling times for its built-in flash. Most of the reviews I'd read of that camera said it took about five seconds to recycle the flash.Hoping to do better, I purchased these GE/Sanyo nickel-metal hydride batteries. My own tests show these superior batteries take only two to three seconds to power the flash on my camera. That's nearly fifty percent better performance than from other batteries. Even non-rechargeable, high-end alkalines can't beat that performance.Best of all, the price for these is better than other name brands of NiMH AA batteries.Better than expected performance and a great price--that adds up to five stars."
5,* Best rechargable AA to date,"When talking about batteries, there should not be a long review.The Sanyo 2,700mAh have fantastic capacity and they hold a charge.I also have Eneloops and they're good, but if I was to choose between the two, I'd take the 2,700s'The way I look at hardware,...if I have to think about it,...its not preforming well.I don't have to think about these cells."
2,"Poor charge, must've gotten a bad batch","With all the positive reviews, I must've just gotten unlucky on a bad batch of the white wrapper version. I'm getting 1800-2100 mAh on all four of my batteries even after 2 full Refresh cycles on my LaCrosse charger. This is obviously well below the stated ""minimum 2500 mAh"" on the batteries. I love Sanyo normally and I'll continue to buy their Eneloop series, but as of October 5, there's at least a small chance of receiving a bad batch of these batteries."
1,Quality Control problems,Like some others my first 2700s held the charge forever and lasted years in my Canon S3. Those I purchased in 2011 are junk. The pack of 4 appears made of two pairs. One pair acts like quality Sanyo the other pair acts like junk. I have switched to PowerEx brand with success.
2,Does not hold charge.,Bought 2 sets of these 4 packs. Once they are charged they work very well. I use them for my Nikon SB-600 flash. After just a few days the batteries simply die. Even after fully charging the batteries and sitting in the back for a few days the batteries just discharge on their own. Get the Sanyo Eneloop batteries instead.
2,GR/SANYO rechargeable batteries.,"I have only had the batteries for a short time, but they are working great. I have recharged all three sets ""4 per set"" three times each. (that's what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2/I2 camera)all good news.I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours.But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day. I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches.These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet, that's why I will be getting more. All I can really say is byem."
3,Not as good as the reviews lead you to think.,I bought a total of twenty cells and non of them tested higher than 2550mah. Ummm.... 2700...a capacity claim that Sanyo can't hit but Generic Chinese Company #1 can?The charge doesn't last long either- These things drain just as fast as any other rechargeable. These seem to be just like any of the cheap brands.
1,Avoid,After a few months of use they are worthless for use in my Digital SLR which requires 2500mAh. A waste of money.
3,Higher capacity??,I am not shure about the advantages of these batteries over the Sanyo Eneloop batteries. I will have to test them further.
3,average rechargeable battery,"from the few times I have used these batteries, they work no better than cheaper brands."
4,These are fine batteries,"I purchased 3 sets of 4 of these Sanyo NI-MH. They have charged up nicely to a little over stated capacity. I have not had any problems with them thus far, and don't expect any. I also recommend the La Crosse Technology BC700 Alpha Power Battery Charger. It is the best charger, with great features, that I have ever used."
2,Not impressed,"I have used *many* types of rechargeable batteries in my day (I have kids with plenty of gadgets) and these are not very good. I would give them 1 star but they do *work*, just very poorly.I hate to be one of ""those people"", but seriously, save your money and buy Eneloop.I do not understand all the positive reviews for these batteries. Perhaps my usage is nonstandard, but I do not think so. I have mostly used them in Wiimotes and now they last only a few hours (after only maybe 5 or so recharges!).My charger is a high quality Maha, so I do not think that is an issue (my Eneloops and other batteries charge very well with it).Note that I have never used these batteries for any sort of cameras."
2,not as I expected,"product not as expected, have another brand of 2000 maH bateries which hold a better charge in canon camera than these do. Thought that be purchasing the 2,700mAh batteries that they would last longer. I was wrong,at least with this brand.look into another brand if you want LONG lasting batteries."
5,Great Battery,"These batteries last longer than alkalines, and are rechargable. I use them mainly in my camera, and am very happy with their performance."
2,"For my application, the BAD outweighs the GOOD","First off, this review is based on my experience and not scientific tests. I purchased 8 of these for use with my Nikon SB-900 and SB-600 flashes. When they are fresh out of the charger (La Crosse BC9009) they will recycle the flash extremely fast and last for about 150 shots. However, if I charge them and leave them in my camera bag for a 3 days I'll get about 50 shots. If I charge them and leave them in my bag for a week, they are stone dead. Overall, the batteries that were included with my La Crosse charger (Lacrosse 2600's) out perform the Sanyo 2700 by about 2 fold (again, not scientific). I've been testing a set of 4 Eneloops for about a month and I really like them. The Eneloops give me more overall shots and hold a charge for considerably longer - there is a small hit on the recycle time, but for me the upsides of the Eneloops outweigh this."
3,"Sanyo 2700 mAh NiMH Rechargeables - high power, short life....","I bought these batteries because of their high Amp Hour rating at 2700 mAh, however, I only got about 20 -30 charge cycles out of these before they were no longer accepting / holding a charge, and I could no longer refresh them.I used a high quality charger (the Lacrosse) so it is not like I overcharged / fried these - some people who ding batteries are more at fault than the battery due to using inferior and / or cheap chargers.To contrast these batteries - Sanyo Eneloop batteries bought at the before these are still going strong, and have had 2 to 3 times the charge cycles these had.These would not be my first choice if you want a rechargeable with a long life."
4,Good High Capacity NiMH Batteries,"The batteries arrived on time, in great condition, at the agreed price. Using my Powerex MH-C9000 charger on the Break-In Mode, they charged up to 2560 mAh after one cycle (which takes 3 days), which is slightly less than the advertised 2700 mAh. In all fairness, they may reach the advertised capacity after additional break-in cycles. So far, they are working great!"
2,Capacity not as advertised,"I bought these batteries on the basis of the positive reviews I read here, but my experience was not as good as others. In particular, I did not get the consistency of capacity that R. Anderson reported. I used the Lacrosse BC-9009U charger's testing function to measure the capacity and got widely different numbers for the four cells, ranging from under 1000 maH to 2100 maH. I believe those numbers to be accurate, since in actual use the cells differed widely as well.Perhaps the manufacturing process or quality control has changed since others had good experiences with these cells."
1,Don't Waste Your Money Money,"Don't be fooled by the 2,700 mAh. These batteries have a very short life per charge cycle and lots of memory effect even when refreshed and recharged with a La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Charger. Batteries fail completely after a very low number of recharges. Go for the Sanyo eneloop 8 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries. You'll be glad you did."
1,Worst ever,"If Amazon offered negative stars I would give this -5 as well as tar-and-feather the engineers behind this battery. It loses it's charge instantly and takes forever to recharge. I couldn't possibly imagine a worse battery, unless for example, it grew legs and fangs and stole your kidneys! I'm a professional wedding photographer, and I got a ton of these assuming they'd be better than the eneloop. Nope! stick with eneloop, trust me!"
2,didn't work out :(,Battery needed some sort of plastic coating removed from it in order to run the intended mdse; so they were returned and purchased elsewhere.
2,not bad in the beginning ... but fizzle after 4 months of use,I bought 8 of these batteries and a good charger in April 2010. My purpose was for a Canon point/shoot camera that I used for hiking and outdoor activity. I was fairly pleased with these for the first 4 months but started to see a decline in their performance after 3-4 months. I used them on a regular basis and cycled a regular charge so they don't lose their charging capability. After 9 months they held very little charge. I charged all 4 of them the other day and was able to get 24 non-flash pictures out of them.
1,Beware of Older Versions,I bought this quick as my laptop got wiped out and I needed another copy. But I got an older version with a really ugly interface and probably less functionality. Takeway for me. Look closely at the version before buying.
4,Very Good lights,"These lights are very good, The wiring harness is good quality and the installation was easy. The light they cast is very good (I won't say excellent, but that's because of the size and shape of the lens - you'd have to go 8"" round to get really good light) and the quality of the materials is just great. My advice is don't cheap out and buy the $50 imitations, as I've had two sets of those and they are truly not very good. There is a BIG difference between 35w lights (the other guys) and these 55w lights. I'm considering getting the driving lights as well, I like these so much. Now I can see all the deer, before they are in front of me!"
2,Not the best out there,"This is a low quality product compared to many other brands. Yes it is better than a simple band, but for the cost select a cable with better handles. I would not recommend this product."
2,too small and stiff to use,"I was disappointed at the small size and stiffness of this band. Also, the way they pack it with a plastic black tie leaves creases on the tubing making it more likely to break at a high stress. I guess it can be used for some applications so, I gave it 2 stars."
2,"Resistence good, size bad","I'll admit that this is the first resistance band I've ever purchased, and maybe I chose this model prematurely. Did you realize that this product is only 18"" long? While the size may be good for something (travel?) it detracts from its versatility. The exercises you can do with a band this size are rather limited. The handles are soft and flexible, but this is not too practical with increased resistance. I'm off to find a longer resistance band that has sturdy hard plastic handles."
5,Easy easy easy,"Just received the product, installed in 30 minutes and no more keys. It has fulfilled the expectations. Great product and precise installation guide."
4,Exactly what I needed.,"Build quality = superior.Programming new codes = Easy if youSetup = Easy if you can read and follow easy instructions.What not 5 starts then? Because of other reviews and what they had to say the battery life.I must admit I messed up the first unit by refusing to carefully read the instructions. Amazon gracefully replaced the unit.Overall, a 5 stars product."
2,Didn't last very long,"It worked fine as long as it worked. However after about a year it began to get some internal corrosion and stopped working. I live in a coastal location near the water so things rust pretty quickly around here. Even so, I expected it to last longer than it did."
4,wearing of buttons,"This is the second one of these I have purchased for my home. Fairly easy to install and convenient to use. HOWEVER a relative with four household users has experienced that the printing on the buttons does wear off after a while, providing clues for would-be intruders. I suggest you use the maximum number of codes allowed, using all ten digits so they all wear about the same. Assign each household member a different code. If there is only one household user it might be a challenge to remember the many codes and not use the same one every day. I have three codes, using one for even numbered calendar dates, one for odd numbered dates, and a third for weekends only. So the buttons are all getting their fair share of wear even though I am the only regular user."
4,very satisfyied at last,I purchased this product to replace an older one that I only had for less than 6 months when it broke. This one so far is working great. It plays a little tune before you can open the door but I like it because it makes my employees slow down before opening the door and are more gentle with the handle.
1,Battery needs to be changed every month,The lock works great but the battery needs to be changed every 3 weeks or so and the entire lock has to be taken apart to change it.
4,Great but before you buy...,"I installed this door lock on a new door and I just love it. However, this is very important, crucially important actually. These should not be bought for doors with glass panes. Because one of the glass panes is so close to the part of the door where I installed the door lock, you can tell it's a little off. There is just barely enough wood between glass pane and edge of door to install this properly. I got lucky and did not damage the door but I can see this going wrong for many if they attempt to do so. If you would like to see a picture of my installation, I will upload an image on the products page so you can see for yourself."
5,door lock,The lock was easy to install and I am completly satisfied with it now. I have only had it in for a couple of months and so far so good.
5,Easy installation,"I watched the installation video at the Schlage site. When the lock arrived, it tool me less than 30 minutes to remove the old lock, install the new one and program my user code. Very easy installation. The lock can be installed on left or right handed door. If you have a typical door with a lock, the only tool you would need is a screw driver. No new holes to drill. It even include the 9V battery. All metal parts, appears to be very solid construction."
2,battery dies,"we have replaced 3 batteries in this keyless entry doorlock 3 times in less than 3 months. It is in a 2nd home, so does not get everyday use, yet something is using up the battery power. I LOVED this product,,until the battery issue. I am going to see if the store will exchange it,, and try again. If problem continues, I will go back to old regular keyed door lock."
3,Not for use in cold climate?,"Other reviews have noted odd behavior where a user can enter the unlock code correctly, the lock makes all the right blinks and clicks, but the lock handle fails to engage and open the lock. I got that behavior recently. In my case, it happens when the lock, which is on an unheated garage, gets cold. The lock seems to fail whenever it's less than 10 F outside. Around here, that is pretty much every night all winter long. Daytime temps are still below freezing, but the lock works if it's above 10 F.A lock that leaves you outside in the rain or bitter cold is not a product I'd purchase again, nor would I recommend it.I'm back to carrying the keys, because I can't trust this thing to be there when I need it."
5,This is the one you want,"Well made, good looking. Second Schlage in a month, this is my favorite. The curved handle is easier on my old hands. For more details, see my other review, mechanically it's the same. Try not to pay over $100. Prices fluctuate."
4,Schlage Door Lock,"Schlage door locks that use keypads instead of a key are great. The problem concerning this lock for me was that it is not a deadbolt and for this reason only, I returned it. This particular style of Schlage lock (no deadbolt) is perhaps meant for an apartment or other type of dwelling that doesn't seek out a higher level of security.The quality of Schlage keypad locks is very good: construction, mechanism and is attractive. I bought a Schlage deadbolt style lock over four years ago and absolutely love it--especially the keypad feature--no key needed and the keypad lights up and make opening the door simple. Whether you want a non-deadbolt or deadbolt lock, Schlage is worth considering."
4,Amazing,I replaced an old lock and once the installation was complete even the door opening and closing became smooth. Not only it is secure and easy but also very easy to install. Great item.
5,Very nice,"I got it because i locked myself out of the house one morning and went to find the spare key and it was'nt there. Someone, (teenager, parent, spouse or me) had used it and left it in the house. I should have got one years ago when my children were younger. I recomend this especially for families. No keys to lose or forget."
5,I love the keyless lock!,"Great lock, good quality at a great price. Easy installation! Would buy another and recommend to a friend. Very convenient."
3,Really liked this until it stopped working,"I had all the same positive reactions listed by others when I installed this. After I had been using it about six months, the 1-4 digits stopped working - when I pressed them nothing at all happened, though all the other buttons worked. This was intermittent for a while and then they quit altogether, taking me back to using a key. I called Schlage and was told that they recommend replacing the batteries every three months. Wonderful! Anyhow, I replaced the battery and guess what?! Now none of the buttons work at all! I have messed with the connections and all, but have been unable to revive it. So how do you send a lock in for repair? Just leave your door unprotected when you send it in? Anyhow, I misplaced my receipt, so I'm totally out of luck. I guess I'm just back to living with fishing out my key every time I need to get in."
5,VERY EASY TO INSTALL AND LOOKS GOOD,This item is very easy to install. I installed it in under 30 minutes and it looks and works exactly as described. I hate fumbling with the keys and this is exactly what I needed. Just enter the 4 digit code and presto the door opens. Great product. Buy it. I bought mine at Home depot for $139.99 + Tax....
1,Not for rainy outdoors!!!,"I bought this so we don't have to use keys and because of the autolock feature. Unfortunately, even if they claim that they tested this against ""extreme weather"", mine already broke twice (I returned the broken one and bought another)! It survived the snow season but when the rain came, it just stopped working! I called and emailed schlage but to no avail. Good thing the manual key still works. Again dont use this for exterior doors that get rained on!"
5,Great Choice!,"I installed several mechanical keypad type lock sets at work and found out how convenient they are, so decided to purchase one for our home. This model came up as the daily special and perfectly matched our existing harware so I ordered it. It was easy to install compared to the industrial models and is much more attractive. The installation of the battery harness was a little tedious because of the tight space and the clip arrangement employed. Otherwise everything went together quite easily. The unit came with two security codes already programmed into the unit, but additional codes are very easy to program. The keypad can be easily illuminated with the push of a button, so it is very easy to see in the dark. I still find myself digging in my pocket for a key sometimes out of habit, but this unit makes entry extremely convenient, especially if you are carrying something. I cannot tell you how often the battery must be changed but so far would highly recommend this item!"
5,Nice lock set,Works really well for my rental. I'm thinking of changing all of my locks to avoid having to change keys when tenants change. Much nicer than the cheaper alternative to other companies.
2,Not For Outside Use.,"Buyer Beware. This product works great for indoor applications. This lock was installed on an exterior front door and the first time itrained the lock quit working. I had to re-install the old lock. After this Schlage unit sat on the workbench for 3 days and dried out it now works again. The pictures on the box and the Schlage website show it installed on an exterior front door. How misleading can you get ?Schlage and Amazon should note that this lock is NOT suitable for exterior applications. After reading, re-reading and re-reading you will note that nowhere in the product description does it say ""suitable for outdoor applications"" or ""weather proof"" or "" water proof"".Unless you have a storm door to keep the rain/moisture out, ... this lock is not for you."
3,Wrong Specs on Product,"""Outside assembly - 6.84 inches tall, 3.01 inches wide, 2.74 inches deep"" is incorrect.Without even removing it from the packing the depth measured just over 3 inches to the deepest part of the handle at the widest part of the outside curve. Unfortunately that 1/4 inch made the difference in whether my glass storm door would close. I had two other people verify there was not anyway it could be installed in conjunction with secondary glass door. So if you have any clearances less than 3 inches deep, you won't be able to install this lock.I can't attest to the rest of the lock's quality due to the fact it never got installed. But, based on the other reviews I read before my purchase I assume it would have been a good lock."
2,Do not use for high traffic areas,Lock would constantly lock itself as the knob on the inside is extremely easy to turn. Have had many people lock themselves out which was a huge pain. I've tried 3 of these and they all did the same thing. I believe the lock would be fine for low traffic doors.
4,The best but watch out for battery life,"This is great and has completely changed in and out of house, no more keys needed. Was caught outside when battery died after only 5 months with no warning and key was in the house. Make sure you have key with you or not in the house."
5,"Classy looks, Easy to install and GREAT customer support from Schlage!","When I first installed the lockset it wasn't working properly. I called Schlage's customer support and was connected to a technician (John) who helped me figure out that it was missing a tiny spring. He plucked up a extra spring from his workbench and mailed it to me right away. I had the lockset up and running within 15 minutes of receiving the part! It works like a champ and looks great.Mistakes happen, it could have been defective from manufacture, or it may have been lost when the seller's source opened the package...Either way, Schlage remedied the problem in no time at all. I don't mind a mistake when it's corrected so efficiently."
4,Nice combination entry lock,"Would have given 5 stars, but the 1st lock set received had a bad motor and wouldn't work with combination. Amazon replaced immediately at no cost to me. 2nd lock set works great and looking forward to years of not worrying about getting locked out without keys."
5,"Stylish, sturdy, easy to use","Installed easily, (using on main/front door, with my already existing dead-bolt), on-line step-by-step video available for install and programming. Programming very simple, can program many different entry codes, as well as easily change and/or delete them. Children caught on immediately and easily remember 4-digit code. Relocks automatically, or you can change that so it doesn't. Feels sturdy. Attractive, aged-bronze, mostly dark/black with some golddish color coming through. Paid $116, feel it was well worth it. Nothing more to add than what was already written by other reviewers. Very pleased."

1,not cyber-punk but utter junk,"Here is a quote from the book, taken at random:""Ecstasy//the beast of the soul/gram that liquefied blood::the internal organ of a dog hyper-links::the psychosexual drone is exposed to the insanity of a chromosome//the hologram hormones of the cold-blooded disease animals that were encircled and slaughtered in the Cadaver City//The defleshed skeletal streaming=murder memory that the reproduction quantifies::evolved to the self ruin=serum of the drug embryo::<<sleep>>;;<< . . .""The ""<<"" and ""::"" and ""/"" and ""//"" are not typos.

4,Singing the blood electric,"Siratori is a startling, indelible writer. It is useless to come to Blood Electric with anything but shock, and awe, as expected responses. The text displays a futuristic nihilism and abject strategy similar to the work of the Japanese ""cyber-flesh"" school of cinema. This is hardwired, hardcore linguistic experiment gone wild: a Doctor Octopus of tentacled text, refering to the infinite nothing that is the everything digital. For readers who want to know what one version (perhaps the least utopian) of the future will be like, this is your machine to get there. Forget the bland sweetness of ""Lost In Translation"" - Japanese culture is far less accessible than you might think. Siratori is the Time Out guide to depleted sanity in a world gone amok."
3,A guilty pleasure that doesn't live up to my expectations,"I must admit, I do some dabbling in the nu-metal scene and I've come to appreciate some of the music such as Flaw and a few others. I was honestly impressed with their first album Through The Eyes, which led me to purchase their new album, Endangered Species. However, the edge seems to be gone. Volz, the lead singer, certainly has a good voice, and it's a shame because he really kicked some butt on their first album. With Endangered Species though, he certainly takes a backseat to some of the blistering vocals displayed on their first album. The opening track Medicate, starts off with a great riff, though that's about the heaviest the album gets. Most of it is soft in comparison to Though The Eyes. I still like Volz's voice, and some of the riffs are decent. As a whole, I must say that Flaw has fallen victim to the ""sohphomore slump"". Perhaps they'll recover with something new. Until then, Through The Eyes remains their best effort."
3,bit of a disapointment,"i loved their 1st album (through these eyes) and got this one the day it was released. am a bit disapointed after a handful of listens. skip the 1st 2 tracks (medicate and endangered species) and also skip #4 (wait for me) the 1st 2 tracks are awful, especially the lyrics and #4 is REALLY bad. the strings arrangement on this song make a bad song even worse. that being said, track 3 and 5-12 are all pretty good. #3 Recognize is excellent, especially if you loved the 1st album. track #10 (decide) is also really good.1. Medicate 2/102. Endangered Species 2/103. Recognize 10/104. Wait for Me 0/105. Many Faces 7/106. All the Worst 6/107. You've Changed 7/108. Turn the Tables 8/109. Worlds Divide 8/1010. Decide 10/1011. Final Cry 7/1012. Not Enough 8/10"
3,Another Review said it well,"Reviewer Mark A Brister hit the nail on the head, this is not going to appeal to the heavier fans. I saw these guys with Life of Agony in February and heard a couple of the new songs and live they sounded pretty heavy, they announced then that they would have their album out by May. So I got around today and picked it up and all i can say is UGH! It reminds me of ""Believe"" by Disturbed and ""Break the Cycle"" by Staind. After an edgy, raw debut album, all 3 of these bands follow it up with an album that is just missing that edge that catches you and hits you in the face. Now, dont get me wrong, it's not a bad cd, i might even pick it up and listen to it now and again. If you liked the more melodic moments Flaw gave you in ""Through The Eyes"" you will probably enjoy this album. But, from my personal tastes in music, i am sadly disappointed. Oh well.... Killswitch Engage's new album out in a week and i cannot wait....."
5,Great new album from Flaw,"I just got this CD today (May 4th) and I have to say that it is great. I got Flaw's first CD when it was first released and it is one of my favorite CDs that I own, and I still listen to it all the time. ""Endangered Species"" is definitely a great follow up to ""Through the Eyes."" Lead singer Chris Volz's vocals are amazing and full of emotion as they were on ""Through the Eyes."" If you liked the first Flaw CD then you will like this CD as well."
4,coming back strong with sophomore album,"great cd, different from the debut, not quite as hard but alil more emotion in this cd, still some good heavy riffs, great melody.....Medicate, You've Changed, and Turn The Tables, favorite songs on this album......if you like the first one you'll also find this one enjoyable, if u wanna bang ur head listen to my favorites and let loose and get crazy...."
3,Best to recognize the flaws,"Is it possible to re-record an album but with different words? I was looking for some evolution. Where is the growth? I liked the first album and I still like this one, I was just expecting something more from the band."
3,"14 Shades of Gray is a very good analogy, actually...","This album is okay, but I was very disappointed. It really isnt even nearly as heavy as Through The Eyes, and the only 2 somewhat heavy songs are ""Youve Changed"" and ""Medicate"". Now ""Recognize"" is a good song, and its good to have a slower song like that for a change of pace on the album, but it seems like every song is about that level of heaviness. I think this album shouldve stayed true to both sides of Flaw, the hard and the soft, and like I said this album only has 2 hard songs. Eh, sophmore slump."
4,"Not quite ""Through The Eyes..But Still Good""","I didn't expect another ""Through The Eyes"" being they went through a line up change, but one listen and I wasn't at all disappointed. At first I thought that it wasn't as good as TTE, but the more I listened to ""Endangered Species"" the more I fell in love with it and now I think I am leaning towards ES more. Even though, lyrically, it's not as good...the melody just grabs me. It may be ligher sounding, but it shows the band is willing to expand (example ""Wait For Me"" with the use of acoustic guitars)."
5,Metal4eva,"Ok heres the thing this cd is not as heavy, but it is still very very good. I highly recomend this album because it is well written with some of the best lyrics out there today. Chris Volz really deeply brought these out in the songs. If you liked the first album song ""Best I Am"" this album is that kind of melody through out the album in almost all there songs, and if you really like Chris's voice you will deeply love this album. Now the only thing Flaw needs is a video to go with there single ""Recognize.""ALL THE SONGS ARE BRILLANT THEY ARE THE BEST GOD DAMN SONGS OUT THERE. I HOPE THEY MAKE A NEW CD AGAIN SOON I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY DO NEXT, AND I HOPE THEY PERFORM MORE IN BIGGER CITIES LIKE NEW YORK, LA, ETC AND I AM GLAD THAT CHRIS COULD EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH WRITTING THATS WHAT I CAN DO BEST. ALSO FLAW IF YOU EVER READ THIS I HOPE YOU GUYS NEVER BREAK UP EVER."
1,Ridiculous,"I was, and still am, a huge fan of 'Through The Eyes' which an incredible album. It was hardcore, and straight up with my liking. 'Endangered Species' ... well ... let's just say that every band sells out at one point or another, looks like Flaw just did it a little early. If you are a fan of their first album, this one will make you sick. Before I bought it, I hadn't heard any tracks off of it, but I figured, since it was Flaw, it was going to be good. Wrong. I took it back the next day (Sold it back to Record Connection). Anyone who gives this more than 3 stars has obviously not heard Flaw's first album, or they would be pissed at this album as well.Apparently, though, the lead singer from Flaw (not sure if it's the lead singer) Made a different band called five.bolt.main ... You can check them out. The track ""Pathetic"" doesn't sound too bad, at least, not as bad as 'Endangered Species' does."
1,This SHOULD be endangered.,"I wouldn't have bothered if not for the fact that there was only one review for this cd giving it 5 stars...a real injustice. This is a piece of garbage, plain and simple. If you liked their first cd you'll prolly wana smash this into little pieces and then hunt down every member of the band, no joke. The guy has a horrible voice and it's only good when he yells, which is maybe in 2 songs on this cd, both of which fall apart after the heavy point. PURE GARBAGE, if you don't believe me buy it and see for yourself, there's a reason this cd isn't as popular as Through The Eyes and its cause IT SUCKS."
3,A review for Flaw fans,"Overall, the cd is good but a disappointment compared to Through the Eyes. It depends on which kind of Flaw you like. If you like all of Flaw's variety in songs, you'll probably like the new CD. If you only like Flaw for their heavier songs like Payback and Amendment, stay away from this CD. You will be sorry you bought it. But if you are a big fan of the calmer songs such as Whole, My Letter, and Out of Whack, chances are you will like Endangered Species more than Through the Eyes. The album is there for those people, but it leaves the metal heads hanging out to dry."
5,Wow a kick a$$ CD!,"Flaws shows of there great ability to write songs in their sophmore cd! I loved Through the Eyes and quickly bought this. Frim the minute i put it in, I knew it was something good. Flaw is a great band and their singer can really sing. While this is alot lighter than Through tht Eyes there are still some heavy tracks (medicate, youve changed, and final cry) But where flaw really excells is at the softer tracks. Best tracks Reconize, Medicate, final cry."
2,Disappointing,"Flaw's first album ""Through The Eyes"" is definitely one of my favorite albums. It was aggressive yet haunting and very poetic. This album is basically a huge letdown. I waited patiently for this album thinking it was going to be just as amazing if not more than their first. What I got was an album missing everything I loved from the first one and replacing it with watered down sounds and halfhearted lyrics. I will always like Flaw, but I hope this was just an aberration and not the bands new direction."
2,Extremely disappointing,"First of all, if you're a huge fan of Flaw's first album, I don't think you'll really like this one. I'm sorry but this reminds of what Staind did in ""14 Shades of Gray.""The album lacks the intensity that ""Through the Eyes"" had in it. All of the hard, intensifying riffs are gone. There are about two great heavy songs on here, and they are ""Medicate"" and ""You've Changed.""""Recognize"" is a really good mellow song that Chris Volz did an excellent job on but the rest of the album just lacks complete intensity. The first album is much better than this album. I'm very disappointed in Flaw and was hoping this CD would've really rocked hard..."
2,Not like the first album,Its ok but not great. Definitely not like the first album. I think there's a reason this band has not had any more hits. Save your money.
4,Not as good as Through the Eyes,This CD was ok but I thought it would be alot better after hearing Through the Eyes. I still liked it but listen to it less.
4,Typical Greek Cheese from the Island of Crete,Myzithra is a greek cheese come from the island of Crete.
5,"Fussy Cat, No Problems.","Kitty, who typically scoffs at everything, did not blink an eye when I took the collar out of the box. She let me put it around her neck and then went back to her typical cat life. Haven't had that kind of luck with any other product!"
5,Zodiac Flea & tick collars,Hi gang-they arrived real fast -no wait-Seem like they are doing their job-only problem I have with them- they are not breakaways.I used to have tom cats and they are always losing their collars fighting and what not-I feel safer for the animal if the collar is a breakaway.I used them on my two queen -one spaded and one whole-I don*t think they will lose their collars-queens are just not as active as toms!!!!!
2,"Works, when it stays on","Maybe my kitten is just a cat Houdini, but he keeps getting his collar off. Not very helpful with keeping the fleas off him if the collar keeps coming off first. Thumbs down!"
2,I wouldn't bother,"Though this flea collar is cheap, it doesn't do anything against fleas. For the period that I used this product, the number of fleas actually rose on my cat. Granted there may be a different reason for the increase of fleas, the fleas were generally located on my cat's head, right by the collar. In fact, many of them were right behind his ears, and he would actually scratch around the collar where the fleas were biting him. Also, there is a lot of white dust on the collar when you get it. Some of the dust fell onto my cat's coat around his front legs - so watch out for this and make sure to get the dust off of them before they clean themselves."
1,Do not order this product,"Wellmark cat flea/tick collars. The product I ordered was 'breakaway' flea collars. Their sku on their website is #46200 for this product. The product I received was SKU #46200, but it was NOT a breakaway collar, but the much cheaper buckle type (cannot use on outdoor cats). If you order, you will undoubtedly get the wrong item as I did because they have not fixed their problem."
3,Protect your neck,"The collar was adjustable for a single use and had a powdery residue on it -that's the bad. However my cat didn't seem to mind having it on his neck not duds he seem too be bothered by the powder residue. He didn't go outside so I can't say the collar protected him against fleas or tics but he didn't get any from to the cats in the neighborhood who frequent the opposite side of ""his"" favorite window. Therefore I cannot give this flea collar anything other than a fair rating because I would never test it any further and risk getting fleas into my home"
5,quick description,"An exhaustive look at Chaplin's and his closest associates, relatives, and friends' lives. Provides important clues as to the making of most of his films, although it does not concentrate on them. Many rumors are put to sleep, while details previously unknown are included. An interesting/fascinating look at Chaplin's amazing life and lifestyle from front to back."
5,Wow!,"WOW!What an incredibly awesome CD!I LOVED it! Believe me, when you guys cut your next CD I'm there with cash in hand to buy. Thanks for being that dedicated to your vision!"
4,The last lobo,The last lobo was one of the best books I have ever read. I just finshed it this morning. The thing I liked about it was the ending.And all of the problems he faces. Even though I was too old for this book It was very well done. Check this one out!
4,Master of the Guitar,"I chose this CD because NPR aired a piece about Atkins and his talent and innovations, and this particular set would showcase various styles he used. I enjoyed both his older and newer pieces, and found myself playing both CDs frequently. He hasn't lost his touch!"
5,CD.,The sevice and delivery were quick and efficient.I'm very happy with both Amazon and the product.I'll be back!
4,Great soundtrack collection,Fans of Eric Serra already know he's done a massive ammount of soundtrack work in french films. People who are new to his music would be surprised by how many of the songs on this album they know already. Most especially if they enjoyed the blockbuster film the Fifth Element.
1,Not worthy of Tonka,I was excited to buy this item as we live next to a horse farm and my son sees the horses being loaded and unloaded from their trailers. What a disappointment. The horse barely stands on its own and is secured in the trailer by wedging its hooves into slots that are a very tight fit. My son was very frustrated and never plays with this toy.
4,Lots of fun!,"I bought this for my two-year old for Christmas. It is much larger than I anticipated and I think that is why he enjoys it so much. He loves to put the ""horsie"" in the trailer and push it around the family room. He has hours of fun playing with this and the tractor set that I also bought for him. I recommend this for little ones."
2,"goof quality posts, fake looking stones","The 14k gold posts seemed to be good quality, comfortable for me to wear for weeks without causing any skin reaction on my super sensitive earlobes. The stones are lacking the sparkles, looks more like acrylic beads compared to the Amazon collection CZ stud earrings I've purchased."
4,very good food,these recipes are indeed well thought and written however if you aren't planning to feed McNails navy you better be good at dividing the amounts the raisen bread recipe was the first one I made when I saw it made 5 loafes I divided it by 2 they came out great and I could of done all 5.
5,Vintage Tech,"@joehiphophead:He didn't grow up in Olathe Kansas.That's why he always says ""KC, MO"", as in Kansas City Missouri, as in, NOT OLATHE KANSAS.Good one though joe. He grew up on 57th, and if you follow 57th enough to his house, you'll know he didn't grow up where you did, in your upper middle class house.@everyone who thinks absolute power and anghelllic were his first two cds:you're not very smart.You say that this is better than his 'first' two albums. And you then refer to them as absolute power and anghellic. Those weren't his first two albums.CelciusCalm before the stormfrom here n' therethe worstanghellicabsolute powervintage techever ready: the religionthere's a list of all his albums. now go get them."
4,Fine,"Does NOT look like those cheap connectors with a thin ""fake gold"" coating. So fine. Does the job. Reasonably priced. Did not give it a 5-star 'coz I only give 5-stars to products that give me things I did not expect."
4,Very sturdy bone,"I have purchased some other dog chew toys that my dog (a 6 year old golden lab) chews through in a few hours, even though they were made for heavy chewers. I have had this one for over a week, and it still doesn't look like the other ones did after a few hours. She has been able to get a few teeth marks into it, but nothing like the other chew toys she has had."
2,My dog shows no interest,"My dog loves chewing, and loves bones but has shown no interest in this. Even when i slather it in peanut butter. Waste of money for me unfortunately."
5,Works just as we hoped!,"We decided to purchase the big knot inhopes that it will help keep our 50 lbs pit/lab mix busy chomping on something. At first we weren't sure if he'd like it but now it's one of favorites. After having success with the Nylabone wishbone, we thought maybe he would like this one too. We are glad that he does. After awhile when the knot ends get chewed, it can get snagged in carpets and rugs, but it's not a big deal. Although we do like this product for our dog, we can't say it will work for all (as other reviewers posted that their dogs may not care for it). If you need something that will help aggressive chewers, this is something that you should look into."
5,nyla magic,"My Lab loves Nylabones! And I am very grateful because he doesn't use clothing, furniture, etc. for his chewing needs. This one, because of its shape, is one of his favorites."
1,"Does nothing but injure dogs, do a google search","This product broke my and many other dogs' teeth. Nylon is not a suitable replacement for bone. Worse news: upon doing some research online, the nylon shreds tend to become imbedded in dogs' intestines, which has resulted in deaths (bone will soften and not do this). I contacted the company and they do not care. This is not a product for people that care about their dogs, even though it is marketed as such. I would like to see justice for the pets (and their owners) that were killed by this product."
1,My dog ignores it,"We humans may find this an attractive and safe bone alternative - but it seems to be totally boring from a canine perspective. My dog who usually loves to chew anything (bones, rawhide, wood, etc.) could not care less about this ""bone"". I tried several times to get her interested in the Nylabone - to no avail. At this point, she will not even take it into her mouth when I try to hand it to her."
2,Dog doesn't like it!,"I read the reviews on this product and figured I would spend the money (even though I thought it was too pricey for a chew toy)... But, if the dog loved it, and it lasted as long as the reviews claimed, it would be well worth it.The nylabone arrived... I gave it to my dog... and she was not interested. AT ALL. She is a doberman, and a big chewer. She loves all types of rawhides and bones, she will gnaw on them all day until there is only a slobbery stub remaining. Maybe this was too expensive for her tastes...? I thought maybe if I gave it some time, she would decide she really DOES like the nylabone, and all would be right with the world... After about a week and a half of trying to get her to see things my way, we have decided that no, she really does not like it at all...Before you spend all the money on this bone, you might want to start with a smaller nylabone product to see if your dog will like it."
1,Easily destroyed,We have a 52 lbs Boxer who had done serious damage to this on the same night he recieved it. 2 days later with other bones/toys to play with the bone was nearly unsafe to continue to give him. Most likely will be contacting Nylabone regarding this purchase.
5,Awesome dog bone,"Like other reviewers, my dog (boxer/lab mix) goes through toys and dog bones quick. This bone, however, is taking him some time. He chews on this thing daily and has had it now for almost a month, but it is stillh olding up. This is the first bone that has ever lasted this long and it should last for another few weeks, if not longer. It is a little pricey, but it makes up for me having to buy him new toys every week!"
4,Better knot chew anything other than this Bone!,"I've got a big dogue. And he's still a puppy. He's went through a few nylabone's already when he was loosing his ""puppy teeth."" like the others, this is a great toy for him to destroy. I don't have to worry about him bitting this one in half (not yet anyway) or swallowing pieces because it is a much more dense than the other versions. It's life expectancy in this house, with that dogue, I'd give it 5 months."
2,"THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR A BIG DOG, BUT AN EXTRA BIG DOG","We had to return this because it was not as described in the Amazon website. It was supposed to be for a large dog, but it was for an extra large dog. We could see that it was HUGE, but we opened the package (which was a struggle in itself) and tried it with both of our dogs. It was just way too big."
2,Too clunky,"We have a pit bull mix and the knots at either end are too large for him to carry it and the ""shaft"" between the knots is too short for him to carry it. Thus his mouth is too small for the knots and too big for shaft."
1,Don't buy!,"Whatever you do, don't buy any of the hard plastic Nylabone products for your dog! I made the mistake and am now paying for it with major dental expenses! My two year old Corgi has slab fractures on his big molar teeth both sides from chewing on these bones! It is not fixable and will likely result in tooth extractions, and for a young dog, this is just horrific! Stay clear!"
3,"Tough, but is it interesting?","I always kind of wondered what the appeal of Nylabones were. Do dogs really like to chew flavored plastic??Well, I decided to give one a chance after my darling doggy chewed up several pairs of shoes, iphone chargers, a remote control and my cell phone (among other things). I thought maybe he just needed something else to chew on. After some initial excitement, I would rate his interest level in the Nylabone as moderate to low. He only really chews on it when I use it to play with him. Maybe it's too big for him? I picked this particular chew because everyone said it stood up aggressive chewing from big dogs. My dog is 40 lbs, but a big chewer with a big mouth.I don't know if I would get another one. I hope he picks up some more interest in his Nylabone soon! At least it has no calories and I can't really smell anything on it at all. Also, I guess it is supposed to be shaped like a beef bone, but does anyone else think it looks like a fist??"
1,save your money,Save your $24.95 and order a golf instruction video with some actual instruction. This DVD is basically Hank Haney talking for 45 minutes and includes absolutely ZERO drills for improving your swing. Not at all what I was expecting!
4,Setting the Record Straight,"mitchler2 says Premiere 6.5 does not support Quicktime or Realvideo...neither of which is true! They are definately included in my legally purchased copy, but excluded from the illegal versions I've seen on the web.I think it's pretty good, actually, and the MPEG2 support alone is worth the price of the upgrade, in my opinion.The new titling feature is fantastic, although I wonder why they invented a new type of style instead of using compatable Photoshop styles.I DO agree with mitchler2 and other reviews concerning real-time preview: it's not truly real-time previews, like you can get with Sonic Foundry's Vegas Video.Overall, Premiere never has been a high-end tool, although some broadcasters do use it. It's best feature in my opinion is it's interface and it's integration with other Adobe products."
5,premiere 6.5,"I am very happy with the product and happy to find out that I can still get program updates. I needed to upgrade or my 6.0 would be slightly out dated. 6.5 should allow me to do dv, dvd and tape. I do not plan on doing tape but I can if I want. I prefer the older windows 2000 professional and 6.5 is not absolete and works well with the windows 2000 professional. I am not absolete and should not be for quite awhile and can use the better programing I like. P.S. I am using this product with photoshop 7, after effects 5.5, illustrator 10 and painter 8. I have a lot to learn without the worry of absolete."
5,Best overall set to have,"Buying the Shostakovich quartets can be tricky. Of the four sets I've had, this one by the Brodsky Quartet is the one I've kept, (along with the Borodin cycle) as a reference to these stellar works. The Brodskys play with precision and passion. Tempi choices are spot-on, unlike the Emerson's new recording, which are plain too fast. The acoustic is detailed, yet with appropiate warmth. A great set. I wish I had tried it first before buying the Fitzwilliam and Emerson sets. I could have saved myself a lot of money and frustration. After all is said and done, I'm glad to have it. It's essential music."
5,Battery Charger,"I've purchased many battery charges over the years, but these little fellas sure do the job on a commercial bus!"
3,Don't use for deep cycle batteries,"Bought this charger to charge/maintain my deep cycle battery used for emergency power outages. The manual included with this charger even describes it charging deep cycle batteries and gives a charging estimate of ~36hrs. Fine for what I'm looking for. The charger repeatedly aborted the charge on my brand-new battery. Their customer service tech said it wasn't meant to charge deep cycle batteries due to the higher internal resistance. This should have been made more clear in the packaging, labelling and product description. I've lost time and money. Now I have to go buy a 'real' charger...Update - The charger was actually DOA. I returned it and replaced the charger with a new one on an auto-shop recommendation. It is working fine. Schumacher didn't want to own up to a bum charger when I called them earlier."
3,Use this with a programmable wall outlet timer,"It makes no sense to have the charger on all the time (float or not). Plug a programmable wall timer in the wall, progam it to turn on 3X a week for only 10 mins for each on cycle. Plug your charger into the programmable outlet. You can use any low current battery charger you wish. Your batter maintainer/charger will last much much longer. Trust me! Do not use this set up outdoors."
2,It works,"It works... Barely. It will not charge the battery enough to start the truck, and I have to disconnect the positive clamp and reconnect it to get it to keep the battery charged.If I had paid more I would have returned it.After a few months of use, does not keep truck battery charged."
3,12 Volt Battery Maintainer,Item was sent from vendor without the cable hookups! Amazon refunded my money quickly. Amazon does have a great system for refunds when I item is damaged or incomplete.
3,Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Slow Charge Battery Companion,its a nice little box but its designed for smaller batterys. I used it to charge a car battery and it took almost 4 days to charge a very low battery. besides that it does a pretty good job.
1,poor quality,This battery failed on me and a large minority of other reviewers. Would strongly recommend another battery in the price range.
1,DOES NOT CHARGE 12V Battery,"The amazon description states that the device will CHARGE 12 volt batteries. The instructions with the device recommends that you NOT charge 12 volt batteries... and in fact states that doing so will destroy your 12 volt battery. The chart on the site is totally different from what is in the instructions.Amazon needs to remove this charge and these false advertizing statments and replace them with what is in the instructions.This thing is useless to me and anyone who does not read the instructions that come with the device risk destroying their very expensive battery!DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU PLAN TO CHARGE A 12 VOLT BATTERY!From the manual:""We do not recommend charging a large battery with this unit.""""Large battery"" is a 12 Volt battery."
1,Not what it seems to be,Should have done my homework an read about this item on the company's home page before ordering it. Forget about charging your car battery with this charge maintainer. Maybe you can charge your flashlight battery with it.
5,Battery Maintainer / trickle charger,"I purchased eight of these battery maintainers on line at Amazon and find they are ideal to keep batteries maintained /fully charged whilst vehicles/motorcycles/boats are stored for the winter, without them I would find the batteries drained and often have to buy new ones. I found the Schumacher good value for money and they seem to draw little power in use"
5,Great buy works like a more expensive model,The charger works really well to prevent my Harley battery from dying...Tried cheaper versions and did not work as well
5,Works fine,"Has a feature to unplug the wires without having to disconnect from the battery. Makes hooking it back up after using the mower much simpler. It keeps the battery charges up, too. Since having this Hubby has never had a battery problem with the mower."
2,it doesn't work,"I bought it a month ago, today I used it to charge my auto battery, I spent almost 12 hours, but it didn't work, I really want to return it."
5,very nice for the price,I got the charger on Cyber Monday for 15 dollars not beat that price. This is 1 of the better Chargers I use it on my motorcycle and my Jeep to maintain a charge
4,Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge Maintainer,I bought this tender to maintain the battery on the Pontoon (marine battery). The ring connectors are not large enough for the bolt connections on the battery. I had to use the extra connectors from a Battery Tender.
1,Died after two uses.,"Like the reviewer Daniel, my unit died quickly. I also couldn't return it to Amazon because it was outside of the return window time frame. I didn't test it right away after purchase because I'd never had any electronic items died so quickly. By the time I realized it was a bad unit, it was too late to return back to Amazon. I know it has a one or two year warranty, but it will be at my own expense to ship it for warranty work. For a $20 unit, it wasn't worth it for me. Other reviewers have had no problems, but I'm just reporting what happened to me."
1,Died after less than one days use,"I used it to charge my motorcycle battery. I hooked it up and plugged it in and all lights indicated that the battery was being charged. After 2 hours, I went to check on the charge. The battery was still dead and the unit was very warm to the touch. I was charging the unit in my garage and the garage temperature was about 70 degrees. The next day, I came out and all lights on the charger were off. The battery was not charged. I hook up another trickle charger and it charged the battery just fine. I think that charger was a ""champion"". I am not able to return to amazon for a full refund because it is outside the return window. If you are foolish enough to buy this product be sure to test immediately."
2,ALLIGATOR CLIP DANGER,"Had it for a week, does what it says it does, but make absolutely sure the clips don't touch anything when it's attached. Positive alligator clip got close to inner hood liner and burned. Flamed up. Burnt the red plastic boot off and if i didn't blow the liner out (I freaked!), my vehicle would have gone poof! Pilot error? Bad design? Who knows.Edit: Just called Schumacher and they're replacing it, no problem. Upping my rating from a ** to ***. Thanks Schumacher."
5,100% Perfect!,"This charger is absolutely amazing, and I can't get enough when I charge my motorcycle battery. It's saved me tons of money when it comes to replacing batteries, and it works very quickly. My Schumacher is the best!"
5,Good Product,"I have two of these units. Bought the first three years ago to charge and maintain motorcycle batteries. Have used it on cars, truck, tractor, wood chipper and ZTR mower. No problems thus far. Seems to be a good buy at the price. (Around $20 at Walmart). Remember that even though it says ""speed charge"", the unit is limited to 1.5A. That means it will take several hours and even days to charge really big discharged batteries. Its main purpose however is not to charge a dead battery, but to maintain the charge of a healthy battery. Good value for the money."
1,poor durability,"i have purchased two schumacher products over the last five years to keep my car's battery charged over the winter. both have died. the first one in one year (just outside the warranty), the other after two 1/2 years (once again just outside the warranty). my experience suggests that these products are marginally engineered and i can't recommend them. BUY ANOTHER BRAND!!!!!!!!!"
4,Just what was needed.,"These units arrived quickly and are performing as expected. Price is good, packaing was good and instructions clear and easy to read."
1,''ya get what ya pay for'',This battery charger / maintainer lasted all of 8 days !! I'm an electrician by trade and am well versed in areas like this.The owner's manual says it has protection internal to the charger. It has a bad design flaw because the protection is an internal 10 amp fuse that is soldered on a printed circuit board.Once ya blow the fuse the charger is history. I guess the old adage ''ya get what ya pay for'' applies here. A circuit breaker external on an expensive unit is probably available.
1,Fried My Battery!,"Hugh disappointment. Instead of disconnecting my battery cables when going to Florida for the season, decided to use what I though was a reputable battery charge maintainer by Schumacher. Read all the instructions, followed to a fault and left. Came home three months later and the car started, no problem. All of a sudden a day later, it wouldn't start after a short trip, after a jump, came home and charged battery with my normal battery charger. Went out again the next day, same thing, wouldn't start. Took it into dealer, and they advised "" fried battery "". They informed my it was the charger maintainer that fried the battery. (new battery by the way). Wrote to Schumacher and told them about their charger maintainer "" float mode "" didn't work. Never received a reply. Buy one if you want, but if your battery fries, don't be surprised. Wouldn't buy anything from Schumacher again."
1,Not for charging deep cycle battery,"Although the chart on the product description says that this unit can charge deep cycle / marine batteries, the chart in the instruction manual enclosed with this unit says not to charge deep cycle / marine batteries with this charger. Instead, the enclosed chart indicates that this charger is only suitable for maintaining a charge. Given the discrepancy between the Amazon description and the included documentation, I'm not going to risk hurting my expensive marine batteries."
4,Product works - make sure you read instructions,"I purchased this to charge the battery in my BMW that had died from sitting in my driveway for a prolonged period of time. I connected the unit to the battery - after three days the battery was not even remotely charged. After reading the manual, it appeared that that unit needed to be ""reset"". I disconnected it from the battery, unplugged it, and reconnected everything. It worked perfectly after that.Works well. A great deal."
5,Great Value,"I already have a full size Schumacher and this little charger does almost everything the big one does except provide a starter boost and it does it at 25% of the cost of the full size charger. If I could only have one charger it would be this one. I paid 19.95 for this one and it's half the price of the Battery Tender and it does a lot more for for a lot less. It's a battery charger, a trickle charger, and a battery tender.It also comes with a harness to leave on your battery for a quick hook up and disconnect."
4,As Promised,"This charger is perfect for keeping your car battery charged during the winter months. I have now purchased two units and they deliver as promised. Simply and easy to use. I use one on a battery mounted in the trunk of one vehicle and the other on a vehicle with a more standard mounted battery in the engine compartment. No problems. I would give 5 stars, but I ""dinged"" it one star because I do wish the power cord was a bit longer. Good product."
4,Item received not the same as in picture....,"The Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 amp slow charger that came, was not the same as in the photo on Amazon. It works basically the same, except it detects which voltage battery you have automatically. When fist charging the green light that indicates full charge, does not come on for at least a couple of hours, even if the battery is close to fully charged at the time. It has three light indicators. One red, yellow and a green. The red tells you that the charger is plugged in or has AC power supplied to it. Yellow is the charging mode, and green for fully charged/float mode. It doesn't work the same as another battery tender I have. On the other tender, the red light indicates a problem...and gradually changes from yellow to green as the battery charges. The SEM-1562A stays on yellow then when charged switches to green. I gave the rating four stars mostly because of not being the same as what I thought I would get, but is doing the job."
2,Does NOT charge car/truck batteries,"This unit only maintains car/truck batteries. The charging time chart in the description is not the same as in the box. The chart in the description lists charge times for car batteries; The chart in the included directions shows 'maintain only' for any car/truck batteries 200 - 1000CCA.The manufacturer should be more clear about this in their description. It kind of implies that it will charge car batteries. It should state ""charges some smaller 12V batteries"" not ""automatic charging accessory for use with everything from smaller batteries designed for motorcycles, tractors and mowers, to standard car / truck batteries and marine / deep cycle batteries."""
3,"Battery maintainer, not battery charger","This product did not work for me as expected. I wanted to use it to charge a dead car battery and liked the automatic features of it (basically stop charging after fully-charged). Unfortunately, the Overload light would come on after a minute or so and the automatic features would stop the charging. After contacting Schumacher customer service, they informed me that this product is more of a battery maintainer rather than a battery charger. For a 12V car battery, it requires at least 10V to avoid the Overload response - this was documented nowhere, not even the user's info. Thank you to Amazon for their easy return process! I went back and purchased the cheaper Shumacher 1AMP 12V manual battery charger and also a voltmeter - it worked like a charm!!"
2,Won't charge a dead battery,"It is a maintainer, not a charger. This unit is great for topping off a battery, and/or maintaining one in storage. No issue with that, but it will not charge a dead battery. At a very low battery voltage like 10.6V, it simply turns on its RED LED and shuts off - no go, unusable. That was on an unusually small car battery, for a Prius. I think it is cooling problem, because in final desperation, I set it up on end, with LED at bottom, and hot transformer at top, then it managed to work. Set it back flat, and it turns off.Disappointed.. risk is that it may not be there for me when I most need it."
2,Melted,"The charger worked okay the first 2-3 times that I used it overnight, but then left a battery on it for a few days and the charger case literally melted and it quit working. If you need to charge a low battery enough to start a car and can get it cheap, it does alright. However if you need something for more regular use, get something better."
5,Nice price for a quality product,Could not resist buying this at the price charged for this quality product. Its well designed and made and does what it's suppossed to do.
3,Interesting But I Thought Em Would Be In Video,"This was a good DVD overall. But my expectations were that Eminem would make a live appearance in the video, but instead, it was just friends and family members talking about him, and saying stuff that I basically already knew about Eminem. I mean I'm a diehard fan, so maybe this video is better for new fans of Eminem."
5,Great Movie,My best friend bought me this movie for christmas. it is a great movie. alot of these reviews explain mostly everything...if i could give it 10 stars i would
1,Defective sprayer,Sprayer was messed up and wouldn't spray. Had to throw a full can away. Won't be ordering this online anymore. I also found it locally for $1.00.
2,It would have been better without so many errors!,"The cassette was great - essential for me in trying to figure out how to pronounce Dutch. But the book was very frustrating - there were many errors which I found myself, and my Dutch friend found even more when he took a look at it for me. Overall I found the book and cassette very helpful, but when you're trying to learn a language, errors in the textbook from which you are learning are the last thing you want to see!"
2,Good basic information but too many inaccuracies,"I've tried using this book to teach a Dutch 101 class and while the basic information is good and the cultural commentary and illustrations are interesting, there are too many errors which require additional class time to explain and correct. The students are frequently confused by the book's errors and it has made teaching an otherwise delightful language more difficult than necessary."
2,Not big on pronunciation,"The book spends about a page and a half on pronunciation, and doesn't explain many of the rules (when do you roll your r's and when do you not?) - and then it immediately jumps into conversations, which you're expected to follow and be able to repeat. I got lost pretty quickly."
1,MIcky who?,"As if we need another book about violence?Get a life and go out one night in your town centre - kids are killing kids!This book is all Watch With Mother meets Jackanory.If you've read one Cass Pennant book, you've no need to read anymore - not that you'd want to ... Charles Dickens he ain't.What with Charles Haughtry on the front cover. A right couple o' Charlies, they make.Same ol' same ol'.Millwall, West Ham, then maybe Portsmouth (in that order); we all know where the so called hard men of football violence come from.Not for real football fans - and quite frankly Bermondsey ruled the roost, not Bethnal Green.A lot of poetic license has been used to pep up most of Smiffy's stories - and a fair share of Tom Peppering too.What is it about East Londoners and their obsession with telling all - no wonder `Bertie' Smalls and most other London supergrasses come from that manor.Mile Eng Mob? Bunch o' crowd punchers more like."
5,"Maria de Alvear: Fuerzas [for viola]/ Christina Fong, viola","Fuerzas composed by Maria de Alvear and performed by Christina Fong on viola is a work of singular beauty. de Alvear's composition is full of both passion and tension, a prayer tender and determined. Fuerzas, although minimal in nature, is a rich multitextured work that takes the listener on a spiritual journey. Ms. Fong's interpretation of de Alvear's composition wonderfully captures the essence of the work, distilling its subtle layers into an evocative whole. Glenn Freeman's production design creates a mood that articulates the piece's every nuance."
5,Spend Christmas With The London Brass!!!,"Great, fantastic recording. I have played this CD every Christmas for the last 5 years. Highly recommended for background music at Christmas celebrations & parties!The technical performance, especially on Vivaldi's Four Seasons: Winter is superb and will wow you. Don't miss out on a festive Christmas celebration."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this book for each of my grandchildren, and they all adored it. Storad wrote a wonderful story for children of all ages that is enhanced by beautiful illustrations. What a joy to be able to find a book that is both entertaining and educational!"
3,very mediocre,"I didn't think this book was worth the money, then again I've seen much worse travel books. I have been to Montreal several times, and although I'm no expert on the city I think much more could've been included about such a fascinating and beautiful city. the irony of this is that the people who put out the Ulysses series are based in Montreal. More restaurants, more nightclubs and bars need to be included. Montreal is known for these things. My advice: keep looking for a better book!"
4,not helpful for the political workplace,"This book is fine and wonderful, but it doesn't really talk about the 'dark side' of work. You can be a star, but don't be politically naive either. Know that some people have no problems spreading unfounded rumors, bullying, harrassing, and ostracizing anyone who is competent and a perceived 'threat' to them and their desired managerial position. Go ahead and buy this, but then also buy a book about mobbing or bullies in the workplace."
5,Outstanding and Useful Treatment of How Stars Are Made,"I read alot and only once in a few years do I find a book that totally redefines my picture of the world. This is such a book.""How to Be a Star at Work"" is a must read for every employee who wants to become more effective at work and in life, and managers/recruiters that want to improve their team effectiveness over time. What really impressed me is how much sense it really makes, yet how different the attributes indicated as important to develop are from those most commonly associated with stardom.In that the attributes identified can all be learned and improved throughout a career, it brings me great hope and faith."
5,The right book at the right time.,"I am into my 25th year at the same company, doing a job that I have always loved, but my star is a little tarnished with age. I needed a boost. The last thing I want to do is end my career with a heavy sigh. Mr. Kelley took me back to the beginning when it was all fresh, exciting and I couldn't wait to climb the next mountain. It's a book I will read again. I've also ordered copies for my supervisory staff, I hope they too can benefit from these words of wisdom."
3,Buy this ONLY if you don't already know most of the basics,"Some good points, not too many surprises; most of this has been written before by the ""impress the suits"" mob. Lots of annecdotal stories (as usual to most ""how to"" books) setting the stage for why the 9 points (sold to AT&T for big bucks I'll bet) are so important to follow.If you're already self-motivated and just suffer the top level management getting in your way, then DON'T buy this. If not, maybe so anyway if you're looking for some new ideas. If not, don't expect this to suddenly get you a big raise/promotion unless you ALREADY know the basics of what makes an office environment tick!"
4,Practical. Solid Examples. Useful.,"Kelley offers a very practical guide to success in workplace with many excellent examples of the model behavior. Quite impressive for an academic! I especially enjoyed how he contrasts ""show horse"" and ""work horse"" behaviors. This book is easily worth the cost of admission."
5,Practical guidance for everyone,This is an excellent book. I particularly like the nine strategies it provided. Anyone who has been backstabbed at workspace should read this.
5,Anyone with ambition for success should read this book!,"I only wish Kelly would write a book for employeers and corporations on how to take care of their professionals and work force. His lessions are those that are hard won from years of work place environment for most of us. When taking care of the boss, your employees, and customers doesn't give you what you need, want, and expcet from your employeer, you need a new approach. Kelly provides this in clear and concise terms for even the average reader. I attended a lecture in new business trends to make yourself a success in the work place and Kelly's book was one of the top ten mentioned as well as the new behavior modification software, Neurosync. I'm glad I bought both. I have reread Kelly's book three times and make a practice of applying the lessions. Even though I'm considered a great business success, I'm always looking for new ideas and methods to apply. Buy this book for the College student, your spouse and yourself."
4,Quirky Short Strokes Cover Album,"When a band like The Strokes suddenly pave the way for rock revival in America people take notice. The band's debut record ""This Is It"" sold 50,000 copies it's first week in 2001, and 2 million copies by 2003. The Strokes, an ""underground"" band often seen as a loss by major labels, single handedly opened doors for The White Stripes and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs for nation wide audiences with their over-whelming success.Enter the unlikeliest tribute Strokes band, or possibly any tribute band that has taken original music in another direction, The Diff'rent Strokes. In 2002, now defunct U.K. label Guided Missile released a four track note-for-note synth-pop cover of ""This Is It"" entitled ""This Isn't It"". Widely regarded as ""bad"" by critics it is however very entertaining and at times awe-inspiring."
3,novelty,"a cool little novelty record of instrumental versions of Strokes songs done with casio keyboards, drum machines, and a few electric guitar solos... sounds cute."
1,Comic....not a book,I was disappointed. I bought this book for my 12 year old niece for Christmas thinking it was the series I had read when I was her age. It turns out it is not the old series. It has been made into a comic book. I wish that Amazon would have advertised it this way. I never would have bought it.
2,basically only retail products,"I cook from scratch and use very few prepackaged goods. This book had limited space devoted to real foods and their potassium, sodium etc., contents. Also, as noted in other counters, there is no consistency in serving sizes and they are all over the place with no standardization."
3,Good information but difficult to find,"The book is split into two section: vitamins and minerals, so you have to look up each item twice. Foods are listed by group, not alphabetically, so it takes some time to find out what group the food is in, then browse that section."
4,A Great Computer Desk,"The quality, appearance and functionality of this computer desk is excellent. I have all of the components of my computer plus two extenal hard drives and telephone on it and have pleanty of storage space left. I agree that the instructions are not very helpful. That is the only reason I rated this desk four stars instead of five. I thought I had a problem when I first started to assemble the desk so I communicated with the Seller through Amazon. I received a very helpful response from the seller immediately. It was excllent customer service. I am very pleased with my Computer Desk With Hutch in Natural Finish by Poundex."
4,GREAT!,"I loved this book. It's good if you just want a love story. The disaster is rather downplayed and the ending comes very quickly. Ms. Duey would be a phenomenal writer if she just wrote longer books. In EARTHQUAKE, as in HURRICANE, the ending comes so quickly without any prelude to it. It's almost as if Ms. Duey was trying to hurry the ending along. The romance would be extremely well written if only it were longer. But, all in all, if you don't mind cheesy books, this is a great book."
3,combine tv series has never worked well... synergy lacking,the attempt to combine three tv series into a movie like event is only ok. the combining of tv series has never provided the hoped for synergy... they seem to just be a longer episode... nothing special.
2,Collection of TV crossover shows,"I was very disappointed in this. Did I miss the part where they said it was a TV crossover event? All it was was three TV shows. Surprise. And pretty much nothing to do with Hawaii. I buy plenty of TV show dvds for my kids, but this one came as a surprise."
2,No one checked his facts!,"I wanted to like this book, but it seems to have been put together in a hurry. Mr. Jeffers facts were not checked. I don't know if I should blame the author or the editor. pg 305 - 309, Washington Roebling the NEPHEW of the Brooklyn Bridge builder died on the Titanic, not the bridge builder who lived until 1926.Brady is NOT entombed in Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn, he is in the ground in Holy Cross cemetery in Brookyn. pg 319My head hurt from the mistakes! THey are throughout the book. I hope Mr. Jeffers is more on top of his other works - this one was painfull."
2,Not What I Thought,"I did not like this book at all, in fact I never finished it. I would say that only one fifth of this book is actually about Diamond Jim Brady. Everything else is about a particular time, a certain person, or happening. I wanted to read about the person and life of Diamond Jim Brady and I guess he just didn't have that interesting of a life to warrant a book about him. I was not interested in reading about all the things going on during the period he lived. And it also drove me crazy that Jeffers would always refer to him as James Buchanan Brady. I've never read a bio where the author is always referring to the subject by their full name. I found this extremely irritating. I'll be careful in the future to make sure I don't read any other books by Jeffers."
5,Blume never stops surprising me!,"I loved this book just as much as Summer Sisters, which I finished in one day. Smart Women took me three days, but it was well worth it. The style is much different than Summer Sisters, but just as good. I hope Blume continues to write for older readers as well as younger ones!"
3,Good for a summer read,"Although it lacks the deep emotions and characters of her young adult novels, and the steamy scenes of Wifey, this was a great read for a summer weekend. I was sorry to see it end."
2,If these are smart women...,"If these women are what Judy Blume considers smart, I'd hate to see her idea of stupid women. Like many others here have pointed out, the women are vapid, make stupid decisions, and base their worth on the man in their lives. It's a mildly entertaining, fast read...OK, if there's nothing better to do for the afternoon. Otherwise skip it."
2,"A kid's idol, and adult's letdown","I wondered why there were 8 copies of this book at the used bookstore. As soon as I read it, though, I knew, becuase mine went right back there to be traded in for something good.Blume tried too hard with this book. I understand that in some cases, things like mothers turning abusive and going insane do occur, but the book didn't seem to capture my sympathies for the characters. I didn't care if the family got along, if the couple wound up together, I just wanted the book to be over."
1,Just shoot me now,"If you enjoy ludicrous melodrama, then Smart Women is for you.Ok, I will admit that I read the older version, 1983, so maybe, just maaaybe, the updated version is better. It's just gotta' be better, after all it couldn't be worse.The extreme whine factor in Smart Women is off the scale. Let me put it this way; say the world wide whine scale is 0 - 10, 10 being OMG whiney. Well this book is verging on 12.A few years ago I promised myself, no matter how awful a book, never to throw it away in the middle, or anywhere else. But this one was like pulling teeth from it's roots without novacaine.In one of the chapters there's a statement, ""... what an intensely ridiculous mess ..."" That pretty much sums up Judy Blume's Smart Women."
2,Pick up another Blume with better women in it,"I am a huge Judy Blume fan, especially of Summer Sisters. This work doesn't compare to what Blume is capable of. I found myself just finishing it because I had already invested time in the beginning. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and I found myself feeling as if I had walked in at the end of the story because no time was spent developing the characters. The subject of love was very 2-dimensional in this book...this is no Wifey or Forever. Pick up something else by Blume instead of this."
3,"Weak women, not always so smart","I was pleasantly surprised by an adult version of a Judy Blume book. It's about a couple of women who all moved to Boulder after a traumatic divorce in their lives, each raising children. The story is through the eyes of two of the women and two of the children and how the events affect each of them differently.There are some things that didn't make much sense to me such as one of the characters seemed to have a split personality she conversed with in her head. Another character actually did go insane - a little bizarre because nothing is really resolved. One of the women dated and moved in with another's ex-husband. A third got back together with her cheating ex. All in all is wasn't a book about strong women, but it was cute."
3,Not Bad,Smart Women was a good book yet it lacked the flowing nature of Summer Sisters. I couldn't get myself into it and in the end did not feel satisfied that i spent time reading it. Margo's character seemed to be blah and we didn't hear enough from Andrew's point of view. In Summer Sister's you could relate to the characters because she did certaing pages dedicated to their thoughts. It was a good book however there are better ones of Judy Blumes. I look forward to her next book.
1,Not one of Blume's Finest Novels,"Although I enjoyed Summer Sisters, I was completely disappointed in this particular book by Ms. Blume. All the characters were disfunctional and not very appealing. If you must read this book, save your money and check it out from the library."
2,Only if You're Bored,"This is not a good book; it's rather boring, actually. Though one is supposed to feel immense sympathy for the protagonists, it is almost impossible to do. The characters are not likeable, at all. B.B. is too cruel, self-centered, and deluded; Margo cannot stand up for herself, even when her happiness could depend on it. That a mother would not lock her 15-year old daughter in the attic to stop her from having an affair with a grown man is laughable at best, morally skewed at worst. Read, ""Wifey"", Bloom's far superior adult novel. With this: read it only if you're a big fan of Judy Blume, can afford to waste money, and are bored out of your mind with everything else."
3,Smart Women,"The book Smart Women by Judy Blume deserves three stars. It deserves three stars for many reasons. This book has a lot of good and bad qualities. One of the good qualities is that it tells you how it is on being divorced. One of the bad qualities is that it starts out to be a little dry and boring. This book is about women who are divorced and have been for many years. They try to regain their lives and to have the social lives that they once had. Clare, B.B., and Margo are struggling to get through life and finish raising their children. These women go through all of life's tragedies that happen to them after they think they have been through it all. The book deserved three stars because it is not a book for everyone. People who have been through a divorce or are going to get a divorce would best read this book. This book may also be read by teens who parents are about to go through a divorce or are going through one. It may help them cope with this situation if they are having trouble."
4,Something different from Judy Blume good read,"I haven't read one of Judy Blume's books since Summer Sisters. I was excited to read this one. In the beginning it was a little confusing because so many characters are introduced. Once I got into it I was hooked. Not only do you find out about the viewpoints of the 3 women who are divorced, but also the viewpoints of their kids. I think it was an interesting read and am looking forward to reading Wifey."
1,"Great Writer, Bad Story","I have been huge fan of Judy Blume ever since the second grade (that makes it about 21 years). However, this is not one of her better books. Blume is an excellent writer, but there's really no story to tell here. I almost got the impression that she was making this up as she went along. This book does not do justice to Blume's true talents."
2,Smart Women,"After reading Summer Sisters I expected this book to be as good because I fel in love with Summer Sisters, however it wasn't as good. It was a bit long and dragged on. Although not horrible its not one of my favorites."
4,Fly Parrot!,"Manny Hernandez, a Mexican-American boy growing up in Fresno, California searches for his way in life. He has a father, semi-respectable who loves to hang out in a pool hall. He has a brother Nardo who would rather have life handed to him instead of working toward something. Manny wants to find a better way, a way with hard work, dreams of baseball and girls. Gangs don't give him the answers he's looking for, luckily. Great book for teenagers and beyond."
5,NON-FICTION,"Something that many readers do not realize is that Parrot in the Oven is complete non-fiction. Understanding this, hopefully many will now see that Martinez is not free to create the most climactic and action-packed plot possible. Still, Parrot in the Oven is a wonderfully juxtaposed story of a boy's journey through the early stages of adolescence, detailing his struggle through prevalent racist mentalities and social boundaries. Beautiful, even more so if you understand that it's non-fiction."
3,Parrot in the Oven,"I liked a plethora of things like ,the way it is happening in the ghetto.I also like the way it is relating to the real life.I also like the way they are not stereotyping the ghetto. On the other hand I disliked the way Mr.Hernandez was prejudiced against another person.I learned to always stick with your family.I think that all kids should read it."
3,Halla Backin' Youngin' A>K>B Eisenhower,"Parrot In the Oven, was an alright book,The reason i say that it was an alright book is because it really didn't have a purpose. Although victor dipicted the life of a California slum very well he had yet to make a true meaning opf the story. Another thing that Victor also dipicted was a drunkin' out of work abusive father. HALLA BACKIN' YOUNGIN'......PEACE!!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time with this book.,This book gets 2 stars from me because there was not enough action for me.What I enjoyed in the book is how Mr. Hernandez always caused drama and trouble like chasing his wife around their yard with a rifle and telling his kids that they were worthless. Also there was a boxing match in the story that kept me entertained and when the main character's sister had a miscarriage was pretty interesting. What I didn't like about the book was that it was lots of dialogue instead of action which made several chapters boring. From this book I learned that all families have problems but they always find some way to find a conclusion because the Hernandez family had tons of problems. This book should be read by 13-14 year old males because this book is mainly for teenage boys but females may enjoy even though I didn't.JM
3,Mi vida,The book The parrot in the oven write it by victor martinez this book was about a mexican family that came from mexico. many a guy who is 14 years old he was themager character in the story. They had a miserable life because of his father because he was an alcoholic and he never was there for hi family.
4,Sharing it with my students next,"I can't hardly wait to share this book with my 13-14 year old students, most of whom are Mexican-American. I hope they will be turned on by the rich language and realistic characters, and I expect we will have great discussions about the never-ending list of issues that the author lays out. I feel his use of metaphors, and his way of honoring cultural figures of speech (such as in the title) is one of the ways this book stands out from the rest. I am so grateful to have found such a good text as this, one that I will be confident with as I share it with my students. Teachers: read it!"
4,Review of Parrot in the Oven,"Parrot in the Oven was a good book to read. It was a growing up tale of a young Mexican boy going through many different situations. Manny the main charater in the book was talking about his life and the things he went through. Manny talks about his experiences through his childhood. It was a good read because it was a book that you could relate to. This book deals with some of the situations many Mexican kids go through in the United States. Manny talks about what he should be doing with his life and why he should do it. Manny is a young boy that dose not have too much confedence, but then starts to gain it up in the book. He understands what kind of person he should be in life, because he knows what other kind of person he could be and he dose not like it."
4,Parrot In the Oven,To me i thought this book was great for the six weeks i read in my English class . when i read this book first i was like i don't think i will like it at all but i did ya there was boring chapters but there was a couple of main chapters that i like the most there was one that the mom wanted him to transfer schools but for some reason it couldn't happen. So he never transfer schools not only that but transfering schools is not that good because you have to start all over again. Then there was a other chapter that i thought was good when the dad goes crazy because he's drunk and he has a gun but he is looking for the bullets and he finds them and they are in the ladys dresser.She's not home shes getting her hair done . So she doesn't know . The whole thing is that he is drunk and people should know how people get when there drunk.I recommended this book to anyone that does read this book it is great and i hope you enjoy reading it like the way i did .
2,A Blip in the Slew of 5 Star Reviews,"Though I doubt that my review will be either found helpful or noticed through the slew of 5 star reviews and 1 star reviews that go something like, ""this book was hella dumm,"" the point of reviews in to speak your mind. This book, though it has rich characters and relationships, lacks the most important aspect of a novel: a plot. Victor Martinez fails to set out a definitive goal for the main character, and rather writes with ""train of thought."" The entire book is a jumble of situations the main character encounters that don't revolve around a central goal or conflict. Besides using unoriginal and sterotypical Mexican names such as ""Hernandez"" and ""Garcia,"" the author writes with an overused and overly metaphorical style which doesn't pull the reader in until the last 15 pages or so. I recommend using spending your money elsewhere."
3,The Parrot in the Oven,"What I liked about the book was how he gave us a good description of how his family was and how they act at home and everywhere. Even though I know this isn't supposed to be funny the part I liked was when Manny's father and mother got into it they would fight to try and hurt each other. I also liked when Manny had joined the gang because the Garcia boys would jump him and Manny didn't know how to fight. Another reason why I liked the book because when Manny's father would get in the house after he comes home from the pool hall Manny describes him as he's trippin ,because he says he be abusive, he curses people out for nothin then he would go to the room where Manny's mother is then they would be fighting all night."
2,Stupid!!!,I never really found the point of Parrot in the Oven.It was just really boring & stupid. I barely finished it anyway--it was just for a reading competition anyway.I wouldn't recommend it-- you might pull your hair out in frustration.
1,THE SORRYEST BOOK I RED.,This book deserve no star because this was hella sorry it was the sorryest book i ever read. I'll give a dam art book a star but not the dam parrot in the oven they can't even come up with a damn name. what that book needed was action not some fony wanna be cholos. and the thruth i didnt liked the book because wats the point of some guy writing his whole life story about going to drugs stores and robbing medicine and selling it for half of price that was hella dum...
5,Engaging human story!,"I rented this film from Netflix (but cannot buy this in a Region 1 DVD!), and I loved this film! Keld is much more likable than the product description of ""overweight uninspired Danish plumber"" would suggest. His basic decency and very human desire to love makes him lovable, and his life situation makes him a sympathetic character. This is truly a love story. The way it shows the growing feelings between Keld and Ling is absolutely heartwarming. This is done in a quiet, genuine way, so the human emotions, difficulties, and successes are the interest factor here. Overall, a really good experience."
4,"Beautiful, simple film","I wouldn't characterize this as a love story, though technically it is one. For me it was a story about the melancholy we all must face at times, and acts of generosity that enrich the giver and console the receiver. It is very much a European movie, rather than an American one, as the emphasis is on character development rather than excitement and suspense."
4,kick butt cd,"The band is Bill Connally on Guitar, Larry Smith on Bass, and Kevin Ellis on Drums, Connally just flat out cooks on guitar and Smith and Ellis on bass and drums just drive this band. If you're looking for hard driving guitar and kick butt tunes buy this Cd"
2,Bummer.,"I ordered this just before starting another second grade year. I was frustrated at the tips and sorry I paid for it. The Cliff Notes for the book would be: start the year out organized, be student-centered, and be sure to go over procedures with students."
1,Waste of Money,"This book is common sense. If you went to college or have ever worked with children, then you're aware of all these thing. The front of the book has a bunch of pictures that look like it will have great examples, but the inside is black and white with few pictures... and the pictures have nothing to do with organization, they are mostly two children standing with a teacher. What kind of visual is that? Save your money."
2,Would not recommend,Everything is fine except for the glass. When you look in the mirror it makes you feel like you're drunk. I will be returning it.
4,Good Introductory Textbook,The basics of public speaking are covered well in this book. The chapter on listening emphasizes that communication includes an active receiver if it is to be successful. The chapter on the speaker's attitude and purpose is also holistic in that it points out the need for mental preparation.Various sections are included which discuss the various contexts of communication. A substantial part is devoted to persuasion. Legal and ethical issues are also included in the book. Overall it provides a good introduction to the subject.
3,+3/4 -- Late period E.T. recounts the classics,"Assembled from sessions spanning 1977 through 1981, these Pete Drake produced recordings find Tubb reworking some his best-loved tunes, including many from his own pen. Originally issued on the First Generation label, these are among the last studio sides Tubb laid down, spawning one minor hit (oddly, not included here), ""Sometimes I Do."" Though his advancing age and an on-going battle with emphysema (which would claim his life in 1984) had frayed the edges of his voice, he still mustered the power of his baritone and easy-going delivery for these dates. Drake surrounds the Texas troubadour with a crack band of traditional Nashville studio hands, with Drake himself bending the steel. It's a touching capstone to a legendary career."
2,Nice try but doesn't succeed.,"This is a valiant effort but the author concentrates way too much on contemporary music and ""trendy"" scene bands; it's as though she never listened to anything that came out before 1980.A far better bet is ""Music Lust"" by Nic Harcourt, which is basically the same concept but written by a professional music journalist and KCRW radio DJ, which gives much better lists of songs and artists."
1,Save your money,This is just terrible. The writer has a very limited palette in terms of her musical knowledge and should not have been given any authority on the topic. This is not for a music fan. Books like this mock the people down in the trenches who really have something to say and know their stuff. It's unfortunate that garbage such as this is thrown out there like an episode of Gossip Girl. Lame!
1,What a waste of paper.,"WOW. I cannot believe someone actually gave Sarah Lewittin (one of today's most pretentious wannabe pseudo-celebs) a book deal, and what's worse is that I cannot believe they actually greenlighted this ridiculous idea, to put a bunch of 'recommended' playlists together and call it a book.Dribbly drivel indeed.What a waste of $10. I predict this will soon be in 99 cent bargain bins across the county, and even then it would be considered a waste of 99 cents. What a joke both her and this ridiculous excuse for a book are, even in this day and age where any idiot can write a book and anyone can become famous. This in particular really is mind boggling."
4,Inspiring,"This book seemed to me a collection of essays rather than a deliberate effort to explicate at length any given subject.The Pope touched on a few subjects throughout the book being the Eucharist the main theme. According to the author, and he should know, the Eucharist has two dimensions, namely, adoration and communion. Through the Eucharist we meet Jesus again and again in an intimate and sublime way.God loved us first and He became flesh and blood at a given point in history with the purpose of redeeming us all. This book does touch on what was stated in the previous sentence and much more. Enjoy it."
5,A beautifully written book,"This is a wonderfully written book and all who read it will enjoy it.Eric, who reviewed this book, is an ignorant texan who never read this book and doesn't have a high enough writing level to say anything else."
1,at 160 spaced pages it is hardly a book.,"A summary of some of his epistles on the Holy Eucharist. IT fails to convince the doubter of the integrity of the Host. Probably the reason why polls show that less than half of Catholics believe in its authenticy. His followers will, however, hold this one up."
5,One in a million,"I have read many books about the Eucharist and many books by Cardinal Ratzinger. However this is one in a million. It has a vibrant quality that springs from a true contemplative, a profoundly spiritual man that really lives what he is writing about. I think that what makes this book really special is the depth of Ratzinger's knowledge of the Bible and how he illuminates the reading of the Old Testament when read in the light of the New Testament. For me it has been a real higlight in my spiritual life and in my understanding of this Sacrament.I cannot recomend it enough."
4,bought for reading group,Nicely written. Really helps understand and prove the presence of God in the Eucharist. Some of the vocabulary was a bit hard to get through but I'm a new Catholic so it will probably be fine for someone whose been a long time practicing catholic.
3,mediocre book,"This book is good for those who wish for an introduction to clinical aspects of speech language pathology (SLP). However from a purely scientific standpoint, this book is lacking. It lacks a functional index, so it cannot serve as good reference. The chapters are not discussed in great detail and proper references are not made. Definitions are helpful but not descriptive. For example, there is a clear difference between apraxia and dysarthia of speech, but this book doesn't reveal it. I agree that SPL is a vast field, so I'm impressed that someone tried to condense all the information into a single book. Overall, this book is decent for the introduction, but you'll quickly outgrow it."
5,A great 9th,"This is one of the best recordings (perhaps the best) in the entire cycle. I find this to be one of the best 9th's of recent years. The orchestra plays wonderfully and Barenboim's view is very tightly focused and does not twist and pull with the score tempo wise. Along with Wand's recent BPO recording and Giulini's great recording with the VPO, this makes up one of the best recordings of the digital era.Greg"
3,"Good art, so-so story","I wanted to like this book a lot. I do like the artwork, watercolors of exceptional skill. I showed a page to a friend and her first reaction was ""Oh, photography."" The book is well printed, so all of Muth's artistic care comes through.If the story had lived up to the visuals, this comic would have been among my all-time favorites. It centers on a murder in a church play, giving a paradoxical ""God is Dead"" message. Although clues are scattered throughout the story (as a crossword junkie, the crossword puzzle stood out for me), I just never caught a real sense of suspense.This book may help round out a collection of comics, but probably won't be a center-piece. I recommend it to Muth fans and to people who value a comic's art over its story. On the whole, though, ""Mystery Play"" doesn't rise much above the ordinary."
3,Fair,"This, like Arkham Asylum, is not Morrisson's best. It still is good though, though it is not very clear what happened, why the murder. Mabye inferring and guessing are parts of his intentions but that is simply nothing for me. The story has fantastic high points... and parts impossible to understand. I know people tend to get all excited about not understanding, thinking that the writer is very clever and that that is the reason we do not underdstand, but no I don't think that is an ablity I think it is very easy to write something no one can understand and give it an aura of mistery. Some people, like with Arkham Asylum, are blown away by the art, which is fantastic. But great art does not make a great story, never has and never will. Still, the characters are well created and the atmosphere and dialogues some times are very good."
2,A shell game of a story,"Disappointing due to a false inciting action that is a sleight of hand to distract from the real story, shallow character motivation and lack of commitment from realism, to magical realism, surrealism to parable."
3,"gorgeous art, enigmatic story, worth checking out","Not one of Morrison's best, but still a good story.Incredible watercolor artwork by Muth... 'nuff said"
1,pathetic...,"Heh...I'm not even going to waste my time writing a long review. Let's just say that if this is the best political ""humour"" conservatives can muster, they are in serious trouble. Laughable."
1,I'm shocked! Truly shocked!,"How can ol' Mallard be out of print? Now where will we go for our large-scale doses of mindless right-wing polemic? Zoiks! It actually does seem somewhat odd that this wouldn't be popular enough to keep the books in print, or indeed elicit new ones...I suppose the cons couldn't even fool themselves into thinking it was amusing enough to support. At least we can still read it in the paper...what WOULD we do without mean-spirited conservative drivel on the comics page?"
1,AUTHORISEDCOLLECTION strategy guide is the BEST!,"If you want to play this game with a strategy guide, then your best option is to forget Bradygames and Prima, because authorisedcollection has a much much more detailed and thorough explanation of the game. I had a look at the reviews that 4 or 5 stars are put, they just didn't know what real strategy guide should look at. If you want to have the ranking of the legendary ""Big Boss"" in the game, go try authorisedcollection guide, otherwise you are just wasting your time playing this game. I'm not trying to offend Bradygames and Prima, but authorisedcollection series the best.If you are a Final Fantasy fan, go and compare guides from authorisedcollection and bradygames and you will know what I meant above."
5,A must for any church leader who wants to be the best at what they do,"Leadership is a skill to be applied to many aspects of life, including the spiritual. Now in a newly updated and revised edition, ""Leading the Assembly in Prayer: A Practical Guide for Lay and Ordained Presiders"" is an advice manual for church leaders who want to more effectively lead their congregations when it comes to the serene and personal time of prayer. With much advice on the differences when dealing with different audiences from children to funeral mourners, ""Leading the Assembly in Prayer"" is a must for any church leader who wants to be the best at what they do."
3,not what I expected,"I was expecting more relaxing music than this, so I don't know if I'll be listening to it again or not. I wanted music for closing my eyes & resting; this won't work for me."
3,Great performers-awful sound mixing.,"While the performers and songs were great tracks listed were left out. For example the so-called medely of BLOWIN' IN THE WIND/LONESOME TRAVELER/HANGMAN were left out, as was DOWN AMONG THE SHELTERING PINES. As for the sound mixing it was horrible. For some mysterious reason they felt that the audience appaluse should be blasted out at around 500 decibles, if you watch this DVD with a surround-sound system you had better sit there with your thumb on the speaker mute button or your speakers may just blow out, not to mention the neighbors 6 blocks away will call the cops. Whoever was responsible for the sound track should stick to a less demanding job which involves nothing more complicated than asking, ""Paper or plastic?"" or ""Do you want fries with that?"""
2,Guess you can't go back,"Seeing an announcement that the Kingstron Trio would be performing at a nearby venue, and having seen them live in 1962, I decided to get caught up on who made up the group and where they have been for the past 50 years. This DVD seemed like the perfect way to do it.This is a low quality copy of the reunion television show from the seventies. The show included all of the members of the trio throughout the years along with Tommy Smothers as host and Mary Travers (from Peter Paul & Mary) as guest. It did not have nearly enough Trio music for my tastes and when it was over, I had lost my interest in seeing the modern version of the group.I think true Kingston Trio fans will be disappointed that it does not include the kind of lively performance I saw in the 60s and is missing many of the songs we've known them for. I probably expected too much, but will keep looking for a video that delivers the true Kingston Trio."
5,Absolute Must for Kingston Trio Fans,"I have watched this DVD over and over again. It brings back such sweet memories. It is a must see and hear for lovers of the Kingston Trio. I have been a fan since Tom Dooley played on Top 40 radio. I have had the pleasure of seeing them live in concert in Santa Barbara mid 1980's, and twice in the early 1990's, with one performance at Rhino Records Troubadours of Folk Festival at UCLA. In this DVD, the original trio plays together, as well as John Stewart in later sets. Mary Travers joins them for a few memorable songs. I very highly recommend this DVD."
2,Kingston trio reunion: a dissapointment,"I am a long time K.T. fan. I saw this show on PBS years ago so I bought the tape. The show was severly edited(about an hour) and the audio was poor. it is, however, the last chance to see Dave Guard and Roger Gamble, therefore it is a must!"
5,Great for lower abs,"I have found these straps to be very sturdy and we've given them a lot of use. It's not easy to exercise your lower abs but if you have a chinup bar, these are a relatively small price to pay for what they offer. Highly recommended."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! DO NOT BUY!,These ab slings are DIFFERENT than pictured!They DO NOT have a vinyl covering as pictured AND listed.I had slings like that and they started smelling pretty fast.Amazon should really do a better job checking the products before they send them.What a waste of time and effort. Now I need waste time shipping it back.
4,right product if you are looking for solid Ab Straps,"These are really a very good pair of Ab Straps. They are stong, comfortable and does the job. I recommend this product.4 stars is because of the price. I bought a door way chinup bar for 30 bucks and these for 40."
2,Great product for short term use.....terrible durability and warranty,I use the ab straps maybe once or twice a week for knee to elbow raises which are pretty controlled without any swinging or demand on the straps. They maintain posture great but the threading is worrying me that they will soon rip as im hanging. considering im the only user and the little use out of them i have done it concerns me why they advertise to be so strong yet only supply a 90 day warranty. I had to call Harbinger myself and was told they dont cover normal wear and tear but i dont even know if u would call the little use i put on them normal (no other users). I do think they maintain my balance well but just think someone would do better with a product that last longer or has a better warranty to the bad threading issue.
5,"Love these Ab Straps, great for boot camps","I just used the ab straps last week (5-24-11) and I love it and so did my women clients in my boot camp here in Chicago.The exercises done on the ab strap wasn't easy, but very effective. I definitely recommend this product to be added to any boot camp, gym or health club. Your clients will love it.I love amazon and buy all my boot camp toys (gym equipment) here.Michelle Rossfeld, CPT[...]"
4,Value for $ - Harbinger 371000 Deluxe Ab Straps,"These straps are superior to alternate products. The relatively large size, and solid construction offer a sense of security. The cushioning is good. The carabiners are large enough to slip a couple of fingers through them and strenghten your grip. Overall, you are well supported. This is important because the slightest irritant or sense of imbalance can get amplified as you exert and try to push yourself to higher limits. Worth spending the extra $ for a well made product that may contribute to improved results vs. a lower quality product.Unfortunately, I received a defective product. One of the metal carabiners does not unscrew and was stuck when I received the product. This is not an issue because I slide the straps onto a metal rod at my gym, which explains why I did not return the product within Amazon's 30 day return period. Still, it is annoying to receive a defective piece. Seller, Amazon."
5,Excellent product,"The straps work excellent! Very durable and well made for commercial use. We have two sets and they get used by our over 5,200 members! Powerhouse Gym Downtown Tampa Bay."
5,perfect pair,These ab straps are the best you can get for the money. Well constructed and solid.Would definitely recommend to a friend!
5,Great,I had spine surgery because of an IED blast that hit me in Afghanistan. The Doc said that I need to do as many movements I can to stretch out my spine so as to take pressure off the damaged disks. I use these to do 3 sets of just dead hanging to stretch the spine and then 4 sets of abs. My abs are on fire every day after my last set. Awesome product. These straps are great quality. I keep them in my gym bad and have used them every day for 4 months now. They still look new. Solid construction.
2,Not the product shown in the picture,"I bought this product ""Harbinger 371000 Deluxe Ab Straps"" from this very same site 'Amazon.com'.I do appreciate the way Amazon manages tracking and the quick delivery of the product.But it was disappointing to see that the product advertised and shown in the picture is different from what is sent to customers.The item does not have the Vinyl layer as advertised and is just nylon. The build quality of the product is robust and good. But it is definitely not the one that is advertised over here. It is similar to the Valeo product advertised on Amazon.I am on a short trip to the US and will be returning to India. There is no way I can get a replacement in a short time. I feel cheated.Please view the image of the actual product that I have posted under the 'Customer Image' link just below the image."
1,Buyer BEWARE!!!,"BEWARE!!! I thought this was a newer release by my favorite actor/singer Michael Parks, but it's not the same artist at all! This is not the Michael Parks of Then Came Bronson, the Kill Bill movies, or of the albums Long Lonesome Highway, Blue, Bridging the Gap or Coolin' Soup. There was no picture of Michael Parks on the cover of this CD and I feel so misled and disappointed. I didn't know until I had opened the CD and played it that it was not the Michael Parks that I have been a loyal fan of since the sixties. Now I can't even return it because it has been opened. I suppose someone may like this ""new"" Michael Parks music, but it certainly was not what I wanted. Bummer!!"
3,Readers note: 2 of 3 previous reviews don't apply.,"I actually bought the 2190 fog lamps, not the 2192 driving lamps listed here. But readers be aware that 2 of the previous 3 posters refer to the 2192's as fog lights. THEY'RE NOT. They're driving lights (read: high beams). Research the products on the PIAA website to make the right choice between driving lights and fog lights, so you're not disappointed."
2,mediocre cast,"Yeah, that's right. Except for Hampson (I love his Don G., too!), none of the singers were memorable. I thought Despina's voice was especially thin and nasal. I just had the feeling that this recording lacks momentum; it seems just to slog through. Or maybe it's just the opera's style is a bit monotonous throughout?"
1,incredibly bad!,"This is the worst interpretation of ""Cosi fan tutte"" that I have ever heard. The ""Despina"" singer is terrible; you cannot hear the Guglielmo aria ""Donne mie, etc"" because the orchestra is too loud and it is so completely out-of-caracter slow!etc. I hate myself for having bought this recording. I'll just throw it away! Mr. Harnoncourt PLEASE. do not record any more Mozart. PLEASE!"
3,Comprehensive.,I found using the sound code for rhyming words rather difficult and I ended up using lots of time just to try and find the proper ending for a rhyme. My usual method of making my own lists and using the rhyming sites on the computer were much easier. I would recommend this as another alternative reference for rhyming needs.
4,Biggest selection of Rhymes,The biggest selection of word endings. Not everything rhymes though. Still I find this very helpful. Would recommend it because of its size.
4,The New Comprehensive American Rhyming Dictionary,"Outstanding book, both in the usage presented (contemporay as the title suggests) and the presentations of rhyming words by phonetics. Highest recommendations!!!"
1,Very disappointed,I was also very disappointed in the spiral bound book and agree with the previous reviewer that it is a waste of money. I unfortunately must not have read the review before buying. I don't even want to give it 1 star but there are no options for zero. I started my child modeling four months ago (at 8 months old) and I've already learned what's necessary through his Agency; I found no new information in this book. There were so many typographical errors it was unbelievable and embarrassing. Don't waste your money.
1,Your [money] is better spent on an acting class!,"Judy Belshe may be an endearing lady and gifted casting director, but an accomplished writer she is not! This amateurish effort would never pass muster with a publisher so that is probably why the spiral bound book looks like someone is printing these out on their home computer. If you can get past all the misspellings and typos then you will be rewarded with obvious nuggets of common sense like keep a pen and pencil by the phone and a map in the car. There is some good stuff hidden in there but there is certainly not [money] worth of usable advice! Caveat emptor!"
3,Enjoyed but still feel there is more needing explaining,"I enjoyed the book (Sheri Tepper is one of my favorite writers). This book (combo of two volumes) definitly has a plentitude (?) of twists, plotting, romance, and details. Once started I didn't want to put it down....HOWEVER, while you learn a LOT about the Thraish, the Talkers, and the Trecci...it is rather annoying that more detail and attention was not given in developing the Strangeys, their contribution to life on the planet, and the conclusion of the Lila substory. In some ways it feels like the needed explanations were cut out in the editing and unfortunately, the result left me feeling that there is a fairly large hole in the narrat sligtly wanting. Ultimately it was hard for me to give an rating - I think 3 and a half stars really more accurately reflects my feelings."
3,Missing pieces,"Ms. Tepper has a fabulous command of the language and weaves engaging scenarios and presents us with fascinating characters, but the story line stutters a bit too often. The ending was too abrupt and Lila disappeared with barely a whisper. The strangeys remained too strange (who were they, where did they come from and why?) I never fully grasped why the Awakeners dosed the dead with Tears to wake them up--- later in the book it was implied that this was for the Thraish which seemed odd since the Talkers wanted 'live' twitching food (yikes!) and the fliers were content with the dead... so what was the deal with the zombie-like folks.At any rate, I did like the book very much- and perhaps wanting to have more loose ends resolved and story lines completed shouldn't make me give The Awakeners just three stars, but that's all it gets from me."
4,Just like the good old days,"I got one of these babies for my Bar Mitzvah, 23 years ago -- and remember fondly playing it for hours when the next best thing was space invaders. When I saw this recently ...I had to have it -- and its definitely taken me back. I play at night after my girlfriend goes to sleep -- the sound off feature is excellent. Everything is the same -- the pass is worth the wait, the run is fun, and sometimes you can go on a long tear. One tip: to kick a field goal, hike the ball and then kick -- otherwise you're just punting. I'd forgotten that. For[this price], if you miss the good old days, its worth the price."
2,Game did not work properly,"I had my Mattel sent over-night and to my dismay, it was not working properly , Plus the batteries were corroded...I just had a bad experience. I'm looking forward to my Mattel baseball game."
5,Love it,"My husbend loves this one along with the Pinball one they are great and the service was great also, we will buy again from this vendor.."
4,for your,"Everyone's imagination is different. Tempi as well as the level of ability of orchestral players was so different when this was written, All we can do is listen to our preferences today. Sometimes it fails, sometimes it succeeds. I love that we are all listening."
3,Order was shorted,The item was advertised as a 5 cd set of all 9 Beethoven Symphonies. The single disc sent was disc #5 - Symphony Number 9 only. When I pointed this out to the seller my money was refunded
3,Overated,"This isn't the first time I've disagreed with David Hurwitz. I'm amazed this set has gotten so much praise. I find it choppy, noisey, steely - except for 6 which is mellow but still not a top choice. I don't care for the vibrato-less strings which sound rather sterile. Why has Beethoven become so angry and punchy in recent years?"
5,Wonderful and thought provoking,"In my search for quality books written by black writers, I stumbled upon BLACK NO MORE and I am so glad that I did. This is a relatively small book, but probably one of the most thought provoking books that I've ever read. It forces you to look at the power of racisim in all of its incarnations, whether it is being imposed on black people from white people or if it is imposed on blacks from their own people. I think that George Schuyler is one of the most unsung heroes of African American literature and all people (especially Black people) should find the time to read his work. I'm currently purchasing anything I can find that he has written."
2,Had a Psy-Fi twist and I'm not in to that,Only read it because I had to for class. Would not be anything I would want to just pick up and read.
3,Ironic,"Very entertaining to see the imagination of the writer. I think he was dead on dealing with the need for people to find something to hate about each other, and how only the clever, greedy ones exploit that hatred to make money."
4,Thanks for the memories,"It was dog-eared, it was obviously used and I just couldn't understand it. But, enough about the writing of George S. Schuyler. Yeah, he was a famous uncle in my family, but he leaned toward the conservative side. Anyway, the service I received in getting the book was above average.The book was dog-eared and obviously used, but that's what the online description said, so no surprise there. I got the book sooner than I thought I would.A very good experience, one I'd try again."
2,Critique of Video,"The video of highlights were ok but there were different Music artist singing the song different years. Teddy Pendegrass, luther Vandross to name a couple. None of whom had a version on this DVD. Disappointing."
1,Poor Quality and Defective,The first copy that I recieved was smashed during shipping and had 2 disc #6 and no disc #7 and was very poor quality. This is not an oficial release.
3,"Love the series, lousy video quality","I love this classic series. Bring me back to my childhood. The video quality is fair at best and the DVD are the home made style, burned DVD-R. I doubt that this is a legal edition. Bumber."
2,VERY BORING,"This was one of the most boring movies on the topic. I watch lots of alternative films, foreign, offbeat, etc. And this is just not well written or developed. There were some good scenes, but very disjointed."
4,60's controversial gay themed coming of age film,"Considering when this film was made, it is rather bold in its honestyand depiction of pre and early adolescent budding sexuality, both gayand straight, in a Danish boy's boarding school. It also has a subplotabout the boys challenging the administrators rule, in the guise of anauthoritarian vs. democratic model. Interesting and somewhat involving."
1,Film will not load or play,"I have now tried three different You Are Not Alone DVDs in three different players (including on my computer). The disc will not play on any device. On the computer all I hear are the ""struggle"" sounds. On one DVD player I get a ""No disc"" readout and on the other a ""1044 incorrect disk."""
1,Only for those who need this special memorization technique.,"Presents Spanish vocabulary using English rhymes. For example (p. 18):"" deber(1) ought toOne day bears traversed this splendid wild. Some say we ought to leave it undefiled.""Bold letters in the text draw attention to ""day"" and ""bear"" in the first line, which approximate the Spanish verb ""deber"". Bold letters in the second line draw attention to ""ought to"", the English meaning of ""deber"".Different people learn languages in different ways, and some might find this technique useful. I found much more laborious than it was worth."
1,Waste,"While the selection of words isn't bad, the method is. I don't recommend that anyone purchase this book. For me it was a complete waste of money and time. The little phrase book that Amazon recommended that I purchase in addition was by far the best part of the purchase. An even better phrase book is ""Mastering Spanish Vocabulary"" by Jose Maria Navaro and Axel J.Navarro Ramil. There are errors in the book but they are minor."
1,Good idea; terrible execution,"The books in this mnemonic series are exceptionally disappointing, and more so to those who have actually studied mnemonics.Those without a background in mnemonics might be permanently turned off to the whole idea by the terrible examples in this book.One can of course create one's own mnemonics for words but it seems like a nice idea to have someone do the grunt work except that even a beginner in mnemonics can do better than this series with just 10 minutes of instruction."
2,Would of been GREAT if they got it right.,"I had same problem half people on here did. I would charge forver, then unplugged did not work. I wanted a headset that worked and had long battery life. FOr the price this was it, but this company can't get it together. Unfortunately amazon(and their awesome return service) has bear the cost of shipping of both units I received. If you are looking for head set, I don't know now, but I did find one I will test out later this week. It is a Joby Boom. I discovered it on Bluetooh truth. I would of bought it here on amazon, but the cell guru had it for 50 dollars cheaper. Anyways this is not worth getting until the company fixes this issue."
2,"Lots of background noise, doesn't fit well","This headset was a bit of a disappointment as it has a lot of background noise, sounds a little fuzzy and doesn't stay snug to the ear."
3,Not the best design,"Design and fit not the greatest. As a result, cannot adjust to get the earpiece positioned well for hearing. In addtion, the front button is very sensitive and if you touch it accidentally while trying to adjust, you have lost your call. It is possible I will get used to it. Probably would not have bought if I had known about these issues. I have not gotten feedback if the reception on the other side is good."
4,"A great bluetooth headset at a fraction of the cost of of Plantronics', Blue Ant's or Jawbone's trash","If you are looking for a quality headset at 1/4 the price of Plantronics', Blue Ant's or Jawbone's trash, go with Cardo! I think you will be impressed. Like all the other bluetooth headset manufacturers Cardo still needs to work on their noise cancelling. ALL bluetooth headsets pick up a lot of background noise when on the road."
2,"OK sound, uncomfortable fit","After much research I bought this headset when my wired headset wore out. The sound quality is adequate. I use it in the car when driving so sound is a priority for me. People I called said they could hear me well and there wasn't too much background noise. On my end, however, their voices usually sounded very tinny and echo-y.My main complaint is that I could never get the earpiece to fit comfortably against my ear. I don't like in-ear versions so I chose this because of the ""adjustable"" earpiece. It is not very adjustable and wholly inadequate if you have small ears. I could never get a tight enough fit. It feel off often, especially when wearing glasses or sunglasses. Without glasses it bounced against my ear and never felt secure. I'm shopping for another headset because the lack of fit is so irritating.I hadn't wanted to spend a lot for a headset, but this one does prove the old adage, 'you get what you pay for'. Spend a bit more and get something better."
2,Hmmmmm,"This unit was great for about a month. After that, the sound quality went bad and now no one can understand anything I say on it. Had the Scala500 for years and was great until the battery died. No, I am back on the market again for a better unit."
3,Scala 700LX,"I have my Cardo Scala paired with a Sanyo Katana II cell phone. People say they can hear me fine, but on my end, voices sound a bit hollow. Also, when I hear my cell phone ring, it takes about five rings before the Scala picks up the signal. Those are my issues with it. For the price, I can live with it because I only use it for a few minutes a day during my short commute to work. But if you're someone uses a bluetooth all day, I would look at a different one."
3,cardo scala700lx bluetooth review,After evaluating many bluetooth headsets in this price range I choose this one based on features and reviews. Unfortunately the first one recieved was defective and would not hold a charge. Amazaon quickly replaced it and the second unit works well. It has an automatic answer feature so you do not have to take your hands off the wheel to anawer incoming calls. You can turn this feature on or off. Overall it appears to be a very good unit.
4,Bluetooth headset,Original unit was defective. Asked for replacement which works perfectly. Returning original unit for credit.
3,Cardo Scala 700LX Headset,"I bought this headset mainly because it was ranked as having really good loud incoming volume. It does. I can hear people in the car now. It's great from that point.The only slight problem I have is the microphone volume - people I speak to often hear echoes and I cannot adjust anything to get rid of them.Still, it was a worthwhile purchase."
1,still don't have a working headset,I ordered this as I have had the cardo 500 and found it to be good value. My 700 LX arrived and would not take a charge. Returned it and got another. Same problem. Cardo says send it back to them (and pay my own postage) and they will send me a working one. I'm thinking maybe I will just get something else. Fed up with wasting money on postage and time going to post office.
3,Flimsy Headset,"The 700 was better than the 500 but less comfortable. However the sound quality was so good my wife also bought one. The biggest problem we had at first was bending the ear piece to be at least moderately comfortable.My wife's headset fell apart (literally) one day. She still uses it but holds it together with rubber bands. A couple months later, mine also fell apart. Unfortunately, mine hit the ground after breaking in two and stopped working. Neither of us dropped our headsets; they just came apart at the seam.If it didn't have such good sound and work well for voice dialing, the discomfort and flimsiness would have me lowering it another star or two."
1,Terrible Design,"Terrible, terrible design. It's impossible to get a good fit, which means that there's no stability and I find that I am constantly adjusting it to keep it from falling off. It feels like some giant dangling earing. And God help you if you wear glasses. This headset was a complete waste of my money."
2,SCALA 700LX Bluetooth Headset,"The ""2"" is for the pretty blue...the headset doesn't sit in correct proximity to the ear due to a poorly designed ear loop that is virtually impossible to adjust and stay where it has been positioned. The microphone becomes buried in the cheek thus closing the orifice. The only way it works is to remove it, turn it off, and use the telephone as instructed in the manual. Pretty poor stuff. Don't buy it, wait until someone designs a Bluetooth that really works."
2,needs update!,"this book would be great if the restaurants would still be there. 3 out of 5 seem to be out of business, which shows how alive the Chinese Food scene of LA is.Descriptions and pictures of the various Chinese regional cuisines are fun and helpful to read."
1,No Coverage at 92603 zip code,"We checked ATT sales people, they say it is covered. But when we purchased its phone and services, we have no signal at this 92603 area, which we asked specifically.So don't trust waht ATT told you. Be ready to return the cell phone and cancel services from ATT. On the contrary, Verizon and T-Mobile both has signal in the same area code."
4,Clear and concise,"I've looked at a lot of knot books from people like Ashley, Budworth, and Pawson. This is easily one of the best! It's very user-friendly, with clear instructions and good drawings. Most of the knots are practical so it isn't cluttered with esoteric fancy knots that do nothing. My only caveat is a bit more could be said about pros and cons of various knots."
5,Very Cool Book,"I really enjoy this book. Its directions are clear and informative. He explains what the knot is useful for. (even if it is just: It is a fun knot.""I am going to order a few extra copies as presents."
5,Superb book !!!!,"Exceptional clarity and completness. Highly recommended if you are interested in knots or ""How to make a rope into a tool"""
5,An important book.,"A book on knots is important book to have. Some knots mean life or death and that is very true for me because I rock climb. This book is a good choice for those who have had at least a little experience with knots. It does a good job of explaining how to tie the knots through text and pictures, but it is not as in depth in other words it doesn't always break down the knot step by step. I personally like the book because I use knots for camping, fishing, climbing, or just helping a friend move this book has all of those options."
5,Knot pocketbook,"Just what my hubby wanted! Good pictures and instructions.He loves tying knots ... a hold over from his Navy days, I'm sure!"
5,Nice little book,"This thick hardcover book is made of sturdy, quality print paper full color diagrams, and lots of instructions. Each knot has a little background, or anecdotal, information along with a very detailed (read: wordy) explanation of it's use and how to tie it.Most all the knots can be devised without the text thanks to the excellent illustrations found throughout.Although its called a ""pocket guide series"" book, it'd have to be a fairly large pocket as the book is ~6""W x 7""H x 1""D, so its actually more of a backpack book. :D"
2,Nothing New Here,"While fairly well written, this is a slim, poorly researched, work with ""facts"" culled mostly from other books and recycling the same tired old legends and embellishments about notorious gangsters of the Depression era. Nothing is new here, errors abound, and photos are common and unremarkable. The author also appears to give some credence to J.R. Nash's long discredited theory of Dillinger's survival."
3,lit crit meets biography - not always for the best,"This is an impressive piece of detective work, but fundamentally flawed in that Williamson does not know where to draw the line between biography and literary criticism. No doubt it is true that Borges's work was more autobiographical than that of many other 20th century giants, but it is psychologically reductionist to assume that his life can be boiled down to a few metaphors involving swords, daggers, tigers and Dante. Strip out these allusions and the book would be half as long, which might not be a bad thing.Nonetheless I worked through the redundant tedium and learned a lot about an extraordinary individual."
4,Great fun,"You have to have a sense of humour for Mika. He certainly has one, which is one of the things I find most appealing about him. His range is startling (in a good way!) and the songs are catchy, fun, and creative. I could live without a couple of the slower tracks but in general find the whole album immensely enjoyable. It's impossible to be in a bad mood with ""Life in Cartoon Motion"" a soundtrack to your life, and for that reason if for no other I absolutely suggest it. Get it, listen to it, lighten up, and love it.You will, I assure you."
2,Just buy the single,"Yeah, yeah, Grace Kelly is a great song and the guy sounds like Freddy Mercury, but the rest of the records isn't worth the bucks. Buy the single.Too dancy"
3,Eurpean CD,"I got the cd for a friend of mine. He had borrowed it from another girl we both kew and after the first 5 minutes, he liked it enough to buy it. So he did. I paid for it and he paid me back."
1,A Waste of $9.99,"I heard good things about this CD, and I liked the single ""Grace Kelly"". So, I decided to purchase the CD. When I listened to it I was very disappointed. The songs on it are weird, to say the least, and not in a good way. He is a self-admitted Freddy Mercury rip-off, and a VERY BAD one in my opinion."
5,New fan!,"I literally discovered Mika a week ago through a friend and instantly became a fan! My taste in music up to this point was rock from the 60's and 70's but lately I've been branching out and Mika is my new favorite.When I first listened to Grace Kelly, my first thought was ""Freddie Mercury?"" but as I listened on I realized that Mika had a whole different vocal range and he delves into places that other musicians hadn't gone into before.Hopefully Mika will come to the U.S. for his next tour!"
1,This makes being Rickrolled seem like a pleasure,"I walked into a restaurant today and ""Love Today"" off this album was auto-playing on the jukebox. Ordinarily I don't pay much attention to jukeboxes, but this song is pretty hard to ignore. Sensing a Rickroll opportunity that was also a win for the audience, I put a hard-earned 50 cents into the jukebox and fired up ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" by Rick Astley. Normally the first few notes of this are all that's needed to rile up an angry mob, but in this case after having been prepped by Mika they were really into it. That pretty much sums up how bad this song is, buyer beware."
5,AWW I LOVE IT!!!,"Oh Mika... I first heard the song Grace Kelly and had to hear more! So I bought this cd and was pleasantly surprised. I actually like it way more than I originally thought I would. I love every single song, except for maybe Big Girl You Are Beautiful. This guy is so silly & fun! Mika's also really versatile and has a fabulous falsetto voice. He's an awesome songwriter and you should definitely check this out!"
4,My 2010 discovery!,"Very nice music, well arranged, good vocals, pleasant rhythm. I sepecially like the track Lollipop, which was further used by students to pefrorm a great piece of lipdub - see yourself at youtube under ""HEC 2008""."
5,Loved it,I enjoy this album is so up beat and fun to listen to. Especially Grace Kelly thats one of my favourites.
5,"Mika....""Mercury""","To begin, yes...there's a easy comparison to Mika and Freddie Mercury. Being the HUGE Queen and Freddie Mercury fan that I am though....I'm so sick of hearing about it...as though Mika is as well! It's not that it's a bad comparision, it's just that enough is enough. We've heard it once...and now every other person who reviews his album in the newspapers, magazines, online, and etc...all have to say the same thing about him....when is it enough? His music if fun, he's got a great voice...he certainly doesn't sound like everyone else out there. Which is the exact reason why I don't listen to radio anymore. You hear one rock song from this year or last..and you've heard 'em all! That's why all these bands from the past are touring, and doing fantastic at ticket sales and beyond! While it's the exact reason why cd sales are down for all the current music!"
5,Got to Love MIKA!!!,"Ok I'm probably not the target audience for this CD...if there even is one. I never really listened to Queen or any of the other people MIKA has been compared to, but I was hooked from the first time I heard Grace Kelly on the radio, and I bought the CD as soon as it came out.It's probably the happiest saddest CD that I own which makes me love it more. MIKA deals with so many issues in his songs and presents them in such an amazing way. The part of you that may not want to like a song for whatever reason always loses to the part of you that just can't help loving it.So yeah, MIKA has got a great voice, his songs are catchy and you'll have a blast singing along, the instrumentals are awesome, and to top it off the lyrics are fun yet serious and meaningful. All together it makes an amazing album."
5,Grace Kelly and the Lollipop Girl Jive at the Butterfly Lounge,Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion shows a signature use of Mika's fun vocal range. The music also delights the ears with a rhythmic blending of clever instrumental juxtapositions. Just enough candy for the soul.
4,Catchy pop music,"I'd only heard one song from Mika before, very recently. Liked it, so listened to a few snippets and bought it. It's got a couple of irritating tunes, like ""Lollipop,"" but overall like it very much."
5,Great Album!,"While I haven't heard a lot of Mika before this album, it is an amazing CD. His songs are extremely catchy and I love listening to it on the bus or on the way to work. There are a few slow songs that seem a bit out of place but still a great piece of work. Well worth every penny!"
5,Singer in praise of GE Earphones,"These Headphones are the best!! No way am I going to isert earbuds in my ears, and risk damaging my eardrums. These fold up nice for travel, because they snap together on the white part, and you can roll the long cord around the middle section, so they take up very little space. They hook over the ears and lie flat against the ear so you can wear them in bed. I even use them for listening to anything on the computer, especially my own music CD of my singing and youtube from my websites. GE made them so you know they are quality!!! I always have two pair and am so worried GE might stop making them!! The only way they will keep making them is if enough people continue to buy. I would encourage anyone to buy these and save your eardrums!!Janie Martin, Vocalist and Hypnotist"
4,Heavy Chewer,"My 8month old 10 lb dog LOVE these bones. He likes one more than the other, but since they are the same color, I'm not sure which one it is. He is a heavy chewer and thats why this only gets 4/5 stars becaue it is not as 'durable' as it may seem. He has almost completely flattened out one end of one of the bones. Its a great bone though and definitely keeps him from chewing on other things."
1,"Not for the total novice who has no musical training, nor vocal training","Seriously disappointed in this book cd combo. I am a total novice singer. I have no musical training. From the description it seemed this would be good for the beginner as well as others. I had hoped this book and cd would help me grasp how to control my voice, how to sing in the proper key. Sadly, it doesn't explain things in a way that I, as a complete blank slate to learning about using my voice, can understand. If you have had any training in music or voice already, I bet this book would make sense to you. However, I think they're wrong in advertising that it is appropriate for the beginner. Don't waste your money and time on this one. Also, both the narrator and vocalists sounded way too hokey - even if I could understand what the book was trying to teach."
2,Better Books Out There,"This will help you learn how to sing. It contains info on how to breathe, how to sing vowels clearly, etc. But the info it gives are all too short, sometimes only half a page on a subject.I'd suggestSinging for Dummiesinstead. It has a lot more information, lots more details, lots and lots more practice and it also comes with a CD that will warm-up your vocal cords and make it stronger.Why am I giving this book 2 stars instead of just 1? Because at least it contains some sheet music, like Scarborough Fair, etc.If you do get the other book instead of this one, you can always purchase your own sheet musicThe Best Broadway Songs Ever (The Best Ever Series)."
3,"Nice, but small for size","My son's are 12 and 5 so I ordered the size that they normally wear for their age. They fit body wise, but the sleeves were too short on both boys. I was going to send them back, but I sold one and gave one away. I'm going to order some more and go the next size up. There great jackets its just the sleeves are to short."
4,Extremely catchy,"This is a great single for any music collection. The original has more interesting lyrics, but this version is definitely worth the time."
4,Suburbs Meet the Hood,"A white male who assumes his wife is cheating on him, goes for a ride. He's met by a black male, who attempts to car-jack him. Adding this to his wife's addultery, the man flips out, and winds up kidnapping the car-jacker. Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence team together in this great comedy."
5,"Another terrific, underrated vocal album","Why are there so many fabulous woman jazz singers out there who are relatively unknown to the general population? I don't know; but here's another one, with a marvelous album. Jackie Allen has sort of a scratchy voice; but it's a pleasing scratchy. It reminds me a bit of Sheryl Crow's voice. As a result, when she delivers a song, it sounds authentic. (One exception: Bacharach's ""This Guy's In Love With You"" really was meant to be sung by a man) The sidemen on this album are just terrific, especially Ben Lewis (piano) and John Mulder (guitar). The guitar fills on ""Come Fly With Me"" and ""Dindi"" are wonderful, and the piano break on ""Fools Rush In"" is not only the highlight of this album, but also makes this rendition approach, if not top, the immortal one of Billy Eckstine. The whole thing is very tastefully done. Recommended, especially once it hits the bargain bin."
4,Sharply written version of a great murder story,"Bocca was one of the first to commit the famous Sir Harry Oakes murder mystery to book form (this was first published in 1959), and it remains one of the most breezily written accounts of the 1943 slaying in Nassau, Bahamas. The former Daily Express writer tells the story in crisp, staccato style, catching the humid summer atmosphere of colonial Nassau brilliantly. Better books have been written about the case but this is a good one to begin with if you really want to immerse yourself in this ever-fascinating crime tale. The great thing about the Oakes murder mystery is that, 67 years on, it remains just that - a mystery. Exploring the many conflicting theories never loses its appeal."
5,A great goofball!,"Robert Munsch is a delightfully creative genius. These wacky and off the wall short stories make kids and grownups laugh and think. Purchasing this volume completes my collection - all of which are fun and memorable. Even though my kids are really ""too old"" for them, they still delight in picking them up, hearing them again, and reliving how they felt when these stories were a more regular part of their routine."
5,We love Munsch,My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves all three of the Munsch treasuries that we've purchased. We like all of the stories in all of the books!
3,Good but could be Better,"When there was a part on accounting it was great, The acting was very distracting and just bad. No one in the movie is funny, more like annoying. But when accounting was taught, it was easy to learn. Again, just wish there was not so many distractions in the film."
2,Accounting 1 The Standard Deviants,"I am taking Accounting II this spring semester and bought this CD as a refresher of Accounting 1, which I took a few years ago. The material covered is relevant and informative and the narrators would have been sufficient to present the material. However, the comedy skits were disruptive, annoying, and most of the time irrelevant. I don't forsee purchasing any other CD's from this company."
1,Wrong Cheese,"I ordered this combo package specifically because it included Emmentaler. But, when it arrived, there was 4 cheeses, but only 2 were as specified on the webpage and no Emmentaler. Bummer."
3,warn people what is in the cheese,They should specify what kind of milk is being used- as goat and sheep milk cheeses tend to be much stronger in taste
2,scrabble a-muck,Parts of the game work at times and at other times the tool that make the game more interesting as well as informative do not work.I was instructed to download drivers.After doing that; it still doesn't work.(an unnecessary move).....NOT happy
4,Good value - tight fit.,"I bought two of these as replacements for the original batteries which were not holding much of a charge. The price was great and they work well. My one pick is the plastic wrapped around the cluster of batteries seems thicker than the original, making it a very tight fit. Even after trimming away some of the plastic, the battery cover still bulged."
1,Dishonored Lady,"I would not recommend this version. I have bought 3 versions of this movie made by 3 different sudios. This is by far the worst quality copy. It says ""Enhansed"" after the title, but does not appear to be at all. It is very poor compared to other studio/company versions."
2,Disappointing for the most part,As a fan of Kascade and Naked Music (which one of the reviewers suggested similarities with) I thought that this would be a pretty good cd. I even spent the time listening to many of the sample tracks. I sprung for it - unfortuantely. The problem is the heavy programmed disco beat that permeates most of the non Kascade tracks. Boring and everything starts sounding similar as it all wilts under a too heavy hand. This is far fron Meigs' Naked Music so be forwarned. There are far better and more interesting compliations out there.
5,Excellent,This book is great for an intro to permaculture. It's easy to understand and there are great diagrams every other page that further exemplify the topics. I would definately recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject.
3,Introduction to Permaculture,Good ideas but too exclusive to authors' home area (New Zealand/Australia) which are not compatible with Midwest U.S.
2,Please don't make me listen to this again and reduce it to one star,"I do not think there is much of an orchestra behind this. A keyboard synthesizer with the bass too high? I debate if the brass is real. It is predictable, boring, and dull. None of my friends would stay and actually dance if I played this at a dance party. Beware, the same tracks are published under different Madacy album titles.Here is the title, duration, and suggested dance:Frankie / Johnny, 3:20, QuickstepEvery minute, 4:56, WaltzNo more fear of flying / Tango amore, 4:53, TangoJosephine / Karin, 5:14, FoxtrotNur Wien, 3:01, VWaltzDancing in the street / Like heaven, 4:05, Cha chaCherish / Rumba Cora, 4:16, RumbaTarzan Boy / Miss Jane, 4:07, SambaCarmen de Sevilla , 2:06, PasodoblePart time lover / Two lovers, 3:10, Jive"
5,Great drill,"I've had this drill about a month and have used it multiple times. This drill has plenty of power, good battery life so far, and is built pretty heavy duty. Weight-wise the drill is quite heavy but as long as you aren't drilling above your head for long periods of time, it should be fine. The drill comes with 2 batteries, charger, case, and a decent manual. I recommend the unit, especially if it is on sale."
4,"Great drill, so far.",Was going to buy Makita Hammer drill which ran over $200.00...When I saw this drill and read reviews of trades people who have used it I felt for the price ($38.00)you can't go wrong. I have not used the drill for a project yet but it appears like a substantial tool. It appears to run well when testing it. I was impressed by the Lcd lights which either light work area or indicate battery strength. It comes with case 2 18volt batteries a charger and a manual. I have seen a Makita charger go for the price of this drill...go for it!
1,Worthless,The directional nature of this light makes it appear to be dim. I don't think these are safe for use.
1,brake lights,0 stars. this light is very dim. can hardly see it during day light. they give off only a fraction of what the stock lights do. Dont waste your money. Wouldnt be safe to drive with them
4,good replacement,good bright enough brake light replacement bulb at a reasonable price... gets the job done for the last time without wondering on those older cars
3,pretty good,"watched this concert for the first time in many years and it was nice for it's setting but it was very predictable. alot of polish vibe going on,but not much that really stood out. count Basie still was a Great band leader and he dropped some tight Piano Licks and His Band was well rehearsed,but the other performances were hit and Miss. I'm a fan of all the special guests,btu aside from Joe Williams I wasn't blown away. Tony Bennett was aight. Sarah Vaughan was aight as well. George Benson played decently,but he seemed to be mainly going through the motions. Carnegie Hall is very conservative and it fit the way the format and vibe went down."
4,Homage To Basie,"Great to see/hear Basie, even in his last days, even in a wheel-chair. And Joe Williams, Sarah Vaughn, and Tony Bennett were fine--Vaughn's ""Send in The Clowns"" was sensational--although I wish Bennett had sung Basie, ""Littl' Darlin'"" etc., instead of Ellington--it was awful to see Basie put aside by Vaughn and Bennett's piano players--How could they! Did they think that Basie didn't know their tunes!--and Benson was irrelevant. Good introduction of historic Basie photographs and informal before-the-show interviews. Standard, well-done, video recording of concert: Low-key, nothing fancy, no calling attention to itself. Carnegie Hall wasn't a topic. Basie was beautiful!"
3,Musician's Perspective,"The band is great! It's especially nice to hear the man himself play his very tasteful and underrated piano licks. The Joe Williams segment is outstanding! Good instrumental solos. However, speaking as a musician, there's a little too much ""show biz"" glitz with the other performers, who are fine in their own right, but definitely not in the same class as the Basie band."
2,I wouldn't purchase it again,"This product may work for some but with my complexion my skin turned slightly orange. After using for about a week, my husband suggested I stop using it because my skin was turning orange. When others notice, then you know your skin does not look naturally sun-kissed. I discontinued this product immediately."
4,Even Glow,I have fair porcelain skin. This works very well without looking like Orangina!!I do recommend gently ex foliating every second day of application to prevent a scuzzy buildup. I will definitely buy it again.
4,works great,I have very fair skin and this natural glow worked great. It doesn't turn you orange and the smell isn't that bad. it gives you a nice subtle glow. One thing I don't like is all the glitter in it.
5,Looking Sublime indeed!,This product works so much better than I ever expected. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a little color without all the UV-Ray damage.
4,sublime glow.,This is the first tan in a bottle product I have ever used. My birthday is coming up in June and I wanted to get some colour while avoiding the tanning salons and blistering Texas heat. Ive been using this lotion for about two weeks now and can see a slight change in my colour tone. I am very fair skinned so I figured I would see more of a dramatic change. This stuff works great as a moisturizer. On days I know I'm not going out and il just lounge around the house I apply a very small amount of lotion. Opposite days I pile it on and have a super amazing glow. Only downside is I look like a sparkling bead that belongs atop a prom dress. My boyfriend said I looked like Edward cullens wife. Haha. Other than that I really love this stuff and will more than likely be purchasing again.
4,Looks great!,"This looks great and not orange! I started seeing it change after the second use! It smells good, too but is shimmery in the sun, for those who don't want shimmer. I personally love it. I would have rated it 5 stars but it fades too quickly after not using it. You must keep re-applying it if you want to stay tan."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I've been using this for about two weeks and haven't noticed any change in my skin tone. I like the glow and the smell isn't bad, but my boyfriend even said my legs looked whiter after a few days use. I'll be trying another brand instead."
4,"Pleasant smell, tan skin, a little shimmer... what's not to love?",I don't understand the reviews about the bad smell.... I feel it has a very pleasant and delicate smell; definately not a bad smell. The only thing I would change about this product is to add spf to it. I am in search of a similar tanner with spf! Love the shimmer in this one. That is something else that will be hard to find! Try this product! It's the best self-tanner I've found so far. I think I've tried 5 or so. You can't go wrong with this one!
3,It comes off on your towels,"I bought this because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. It smells pretty good when you put it on and not as bad afterwards as most products that give you a sunless tan. And it leaves a nice even color that looks natural. Only one complaint, and I'm surprised I didn't see this in other reviews. After you shower when you dry off, the color comes off on the towels! I thought at first I was putting on too much, but no matter how little I use, it still leaves brown stains on my towels. They come off in the washing machine, but it just means a lot of extra towel washing -- after every shower or two, depending how fussy you are about how your towels look."
3,Gives a light tan to skin,"I like this lotion because it gives a subtle tan to skin, but I do not the shimmer it leaves behind on my skin."
5,Process Optimization Made Easy,"""CMMI Distilled"" is the first book to turn to when introducing CMMI or improving upon existing CMMI practices.Those who have developed software in properly functioning CMMI environments have experienced the ""zen-like"" tranquility of knowing risks will be identified & mitigated early, requirements will be met, & milestones will be achieved.To date, this is the best book for showing the path to achieve disciplined, mindful execution. The book describes how to properly balance the right mix of processes, based on program goals & team chemistry/maturity - and grow the team & its processes over time."
2,"A summary of CMMI, not a practical introduction","I bought the book thinking it would be a practical introduction on how to apply CMMI to your company hence I was very disappointed to find out the authors have limited themselves only to summarize the CMMI models. Few real explication is given about concepts within the CMMI models, neither any real life experience is shared that could help you implement CMMI."
2,"Not for me, I'm afraid","Many words, but not too practical. Definitions are fine, but that could have happened in 50 pages. This book basically consists of bureacratic motherhood. I will now look for a book written by someone who has actually managed a project to see what his book says about practical application of CMMI.I wish I could remember the name of the author of a book I read several years ago on SEI processes, which provided excellent guidelines for projects. The author was very explicit and provided examples. He also stated in the Foreword that, though the book contained a great deal of excellent and useful information, if you tried to do everything in the book, you would fail. That may have been the most important line he wrote, since it implied that common sense was still the most important ingredient to meaningful process."
1,Difficult to pull out,"I found these extremely difficult to pull out when I needed to use the socket. I actually had to use the metal from the cord to pry under it to pry it up. I recomend buying the safety plates that you have to slide to make work. They are more expensive, but much easier to use."
4,Leatherman Charge and Pouch,"The tool itself is excellent but the pouch is disappointing. I purchased a ""Bit Driver Extension and there is no place in the pouch for it to be stored safely. It just falls through the bottom of the pouch. One would think ""Leatherman"" would know that folks who buy this type of quality product, would want all the pieces to go with the tool in the same pouch...."
1,Not a Quality tool for the money.,I guess I just got one from a bad lot. But none of the internal tools willstay locked open. When you try to use them they will fold in on your hand.When I spend this much money for a multi-tool I really am expecting a littlemore quality in the tool. I also have a Gerber that I paid half as much forand is a better tool that I have gone back to. At least the knives stay lockedopen on this tool or I would be pecking this review.
4,Great Quality,I bought this for my boyfriend and he had a very old Gerber prior to this. He seems to love it and plans on getting additional bits for it soon.
2,Incomplete package,"I had seen various versions of the Charge at another store that did not have the TTi. I bought the TTi from Amazon because I've had good luck with buying things from them. This time was an exception. The product came on time but was missing 3 components - the 9 bits, the lanyard clip and the pocket clip.It looked to me like the package had been opened before because it was missing packaging components present in previous purchases of similar knifes I've bought before.I'll try to get these items replaced and see how it goes."
5,great muli tool,"this is actualy my second leatherman, i lost the first one and baoght the same one since i liked it so much. only negitives are the crimpers dont really work to well and it says it has 19 tools on the website, but thats only if u include all the removable screw bits. other then that its great"
3,One tool does it all,Leatherman 830684 Charge TTi with Leather Sheath and Gift TinI found the origional Charge to be superior as the blade tip was broader and less subject to breakage. The tool is a handy item for hiking or climbing. Great for adjusting or fixing gear. Wonderful for emergency situations.
4,Useful Tool - Whimpy Bit,"This is my first Multi-Tool so I can't possibly give a review that comes near the detail and usefulness of the many comparison reviews by longtime users of Multi-Tools. I read many reviews before I decided on a tool to purchase and I am happy with the choice. The 'feel' is high quality, comfortable, and reliable. It gets a lot of use and spends time nearby in the sheath or clipped to my belt.The only problem I've had is the smallest size hex bit stripped under somewhat light use the first time I needed it. I was using it to change the position of a pocket clip on a Buck Paradigm Pro. I was able to use the smallest size wrench from a $2.00 set from Walmart, which handled the job while maintaining its integrity. This has kept me from purchasing the expanded bit set from Leatherman.Aside from this disappointment, and I guess I would prefer a tool without this option, the rest of the tool is reliable and I am happy with the purchase."
2,Upsetting,"So today after 16 months of every day, light to moderate use, one of my pliers broke in half, right in the middle of the crimper, while I was pulling a retaining clip out. Such a bummer. I also have a wave that I used every day for 4 years at the same job untill the charge tti came in the mail. I'm very unpleased to say the least. Considering paying 110$.Good thing is leatherman's customer service is excellent. Hopefully i will have a replacement soon."
5,Awesome,"These Multitools is ""don't leave home without it"" items, so I carried it with me most of the time. Multi functions very handy and durability is outstanding. Two thumbs up for you Leatherman."
4,Excellent product except for the sheath,"I received my Leatherman Charge TTi Multi-tool 2 days ago. I must say that I am impressed with the quality and workmanship of this product. It is just as what I imagined. It's cutting tools are very sharp and strong. The other tools are sturdy as well and look like they can do the job that they are supposed to do.However, I find the sheath that came along with the multi-tool a put-off. While the combination of leather and nylon blends well (with nice finishing), I find great difficulty in closing the sheath. It takes a lot of effort to close the button of the sheath. I don't know whether it is purposely designed in such a way or it is a flaw. The sheath is important as this multi-tool is a bit hefty to be in your pocket."
4,Leatherman 830684 Charge TTi,"Nice, well made product. Everything appeared fine except for scissors - somewhat flimsy due to insufficiently swaged pivot. Suggestion for Leatherman QA - a few more wall posters ""Quality is job #1""."
3,OK for 5 bucks,"The Peloponnesian Wars video is essentially a fifty minute lecture by suits with video clips showing of a bunch of guys wearing period costumes (presumably accurate), local ruins, maps of historic significance, and one primitive animated battle schematic scene. Five dollars is a reasonable price for the kind of a visual encyclopedia presentation you get."
3,Pots are chipped in the box,We've returned two so have had a total of three of these and each one was chipped before removing it from the box. We have a large Le Creuset pot and haven't had any problems with chipped enamel. But the Rachael Ray pot is about 1/8th of the price. It's ok but the quality isn't great.
4,Great Size--when braising for two!,This pot is perfect for cooking for two. Smaller quantities of stews and braises fit nicely into this pot. The pot seems to be well made and durable and certainly cheaper than the well known brands.
5,Wonderful,"We have it memorized, our sons love it so much. Our favorite of the series so far. Slinky is great!"
1,A Work of Fiction,"If it wasn't for the fact that I was a subject of the UNABOM investigation for 20 years this book would be extremely humorous. Almost every fact about the UNABOM case in this book is materially wrong down to the room in which the Dungeons and Dragons group convened. Anything in regards to Ms. Delong's participation are outright lies. (She did manage to quote me correctly, however). Thus, I cannot believe anything else she writes. It is my understanding that Ms. Delong was almost fired from the FBI because she would clock in and then leave to work at another job. She was also described as a 'worthless agent' by one of the better agents I had dealt with over the years. Please keep your hard earned money and do not encourage self-aggrandizing garbage like this. In 20 years of being investigated I discovered that there are FBI agents who actually care about the truth - Ms. Delong is not one of them."
5,A very good book,"Candice Delong wrote a great book, but more than that she is a great person. I enjoyed everything I read, her style was entertaining, and her accounts of her life in the FBI were thrilling. She made the FBI seem real and amazing. I would love to follow in her foot steps, become a FBI Agent and write a book that is as good as this one!P.S. Candice, I just want to say that your book is an inspiration to me. It would be my honour if you would email me someday."
1,Waste of money unless you want pure fiction,"This book should be listed under ""fiction,"" because that's what it is. Ms. DeLong is a legend in her mind and her mind only. Anyone who reads this and believes Ms. DeLong actually did the things she claimed to do is living in a dream, just like Ms. DeLong. Don't waste your money. Ms. DeLong is as much a real life Clarice Starling as Barney Fife is Elliot Ness. I would recommend the book if you are looking for a good laugh. I rated this garbage one star because I wasn't given the choice of zero or negative stars."
3,"Great story, okay writer","Candice DeLong has a great story to tell, I only wish her editor had been a little tougher on her inclination to be redundant. If I had to hear her refer to her former job as a Psych Nurse one more time I was going to scream. Anyone who had gotten beyond the first couple of chapters knew what her prior history had been, but she underestimates the memory capacity and intelligence of her readers by repeating well worn facts. This is not to discount her accomplishments, she has done many great things with her life and it's good of her to share them with the public, but it's obvious that her first calling wasn't as a writer."
4,good book on inner workings of FBI in a time of turmoil,"Candice DeLong is the sister to one of my best friend's fathers, and the Rosing Family is extremely talented. My interest level in this book was high and I was glad I read it and will reccommend it to many people. It's great for women who can understand the inner workings of what goes on in sex offenders' minds, how to avoid danger and problematic situations. It was also nice to hear how this one FBI Agent was able to excel while the FBI is certainly facing difficult times from an image standpoint."
3,"Good autobiography, some concerns about details","I general, I enjoyed the book a great deal. Many of the everyday details were quite nifty.Unfortunately, my radar perked at pages 240-41 with a wildly erroneous description of ""Dungeons and Dragons"" and the hobbists that play it. I am deeply troubled that the agent _in charge of_ this part of the Unabomber investigation badly misunderstood what she was investigating.There several points where the narrative moves around chronologically with few signposts to keep one oriented in time and place."
5,"WOW!----Candice, Like her Book...ROCKS!!!----WOW!",...I could not set it down! I just purchased the audiotape also… so I'll write more after I'm done listening to it. Agent Candice is a LEGEND in her own time! OH… [I hope] this book is going to be a movie soon !!! One can only hope! D.W.H
4,"Lock your doors, pull down the shades","I'm even MORE paranoid than I was before now that I've finished Candice DeLong's book. Her tales of the cases she's been involved with are truly intriguing and often chilling. However, if you're looking for an inside scoop on the FBI, you certainly won't find it here. DeLong doesn't offer any suprising revelations about the hardships of being a woman in this blue-suit environment, nor does she give her reader any critical analysis of the inner workings of the FBI. But, it is a very entertaining (if unsettling) read. At the end of the book, DeLong offers some tips on lessening your chances of becoming a crime victim, but the overall message of the book seems to be a rather doomed one: crime happens, and it happens to people like you and me for no real reason at all."
5,A great read on an interesting subject,"This book was simply captivating, plus it reminded me how hard it was to be treated with respect in the early 80's as a working woman. Not that Special Agent DeLong whines about it at all - she merely states it like it was, and sometimes still is. The cases on which she worked were of such interest and variety that I couldn't put this book down. Even those with a passing interest in law enforcement would do well to read this book. Ms. DeLong is the kind of lady you'd like to have as a friend and a neighbor. She is a great example of a courageous single mom and working woman. This would be a great book for young women, late high school to college age, who are trying to figure out what they want to do professionally."
5,An incredible profile of dedication and compassion,"Candice Delong tells it like it is. This book held me riveted and page turning. I could not put it down. Ms. Delong exemplifies a woman who is dedicated to justice and the right thing to do. At great personal expense Delong did her job. However, as a mother, she had her priorities clearly defined. Delong's son was her greatest priority. The part about the Unibomber wearing her son's coat touched me deeply. This lady is indeed a national hero. In all the turmoil that America is involved in, it is wonderful to read about a woman who has made a difference in so many lives. Courage, integrity, and ethics all apply to this amazing woman."
4,Women in the FBI,This book gives a good insight on how the FBI worked back in the 1980's. I thought it was a very good book. Miss DeLong seemed to have a lot of great cases. She makes the book very intresting. The one thing that i did not like about the book was the way it was organized. It jumped from one thing to another. Then back again to where it picked off. Over all the book is great and i highly recommend it to anyone who is interted in joining the FBI.
3,NUT WAS NOT INCLUDED???,"The clamp itself is fine, very heavy and well plated. However, in the bag was a chromed 7mm Allen head bolt and one washer, but the nut was not in the bag. Real hassle because the thread pattern/size in not common and had a hard time finding a nut.Thought about returning or contacting where I purchased it but that would waste time I did not have. I ended up not using the supplied bolt and got a nice looking chromed nut and bolt from my motorcycle dealer.Not real happy with this product."
4,P Clamps,"Got these to mount my handlebar mounted speakers down on the forks. Freakin awesome. Fits great, looks great, bike even rides a little better because they're more level now. I did have to go get some washers, etc. but that wasn't the fault of the clamps, but more the crappy stock clamps that came with the speakers lol. These are nice though, zero complaints."
4,More great George stories!,"We have the original collection of George stories (the red book) and have read them so many times that we were kind of desperate for a new collection to read to my son. So I was thrilled to find this - you can get almost all of these stories individually but that hardly seems cost effective when you can get this pretty collection instead for a really good price (it's only $8 right now on Amazon).The stories in this book are classic George and although maybe not quite as good as the Red book, I'm not sure if that's true or if I'm just really used to those Red Book stories as I know them all by heart at this point. My son loves them just as much as the first book and asks for both books equally."
5,FABULOUS Book for any Collection!,We LOVE these Curous George stories! My son asks me to read them to him all the time. The stories are very entertaining and suitable for any child.
2,Not as good as the original at ALL,"I bought this for my son for his 2nd Birthday, he loves Curious George. His ""red"" Curious George book, The ""original"" adventures of Curious George was falling apart, we have read it so many times. So when I found out about this book, I was really excited and ordered it for him right away. Well, it was kind of a waste of money. After reading two of the ""blue"" George stories, he was back to asking for the ""red"" George. He actually shut the book while I was reading it to him during the story where George and The Man w/the Y hat go to the ski lodge. I don't know how to explain, these stories have the same redundant plot line that the ""red"" George book has (Man w/Y hat is not paying attention, monkey gets into trouble, trouble is solved in unlikely way, the end) but they are written differently. The illustrations look slightly different too. I would save your money if you're thinking about getting this book."
1,Loving Curious George,I ordered this book for my grandson. We have already had many good times of reading & enjoying it. He is a big fan of Curious George.
3,"Formulaic, formulaic","My 21-month old son loves the book, but I'm thoroughly sick of it already even though I've previously enjoyed the Curious George books. These stories are barely different from some previous ""George"" books I've read - for instance, Curious George and the Puppies is very, very similar in story line to Curious George and the Bunny - which is itself a rehash of a scene in Curious George Flies a Kite. I agree that the illustrations are great, and I realize that little kids like to know what to expect from a George book, but at least the adventures should sound adventurous!"
1,skip this remake and buy the original,"every story in this book has been made with the same storyline. The original fun and creativity is gone.My opinion - if you want good original George, buy the original, this is rehash which can be great for the very young, but my daughter and I have quickly gotten bored with this"
2,"Nothing ""new"" about it","We bought our daughter the Complete Adventures of Curious George and thoroughly enjoyed the long meandering story lines. In the New Adventures, the stories are more focused, brief, and formulaic. My daughter still enjoys the stories, but I get bored."
2,To the reader from Coral Springs,"Don't buy into this. I have a relative in her 70's who is type A and her parents were both in their early 90's when they died, so one of them must have been type A. I agree on a few things such as the lack of stomach acid and being prone to anxiety, since I've never taken antacids a day in my life and stress easily. I will not, however, give up my steak under any circumstances."
3,Informative,"Living as a survivor I like to stay abreast (so to speak) of what I can do to help myself stay on this plane longer as a healthy individual. Nothing new as far as I can tell, same ole, same ole."
4,This is not what I expected,This is not what I expected at all. I love kaleidoscope quilts but this was not complete and it was not as pretty as I expected
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought I was getting a quilt book about gorgeous quilts;instead I received a book containing 12 folded & detachable sheets of gift wrap paper - no writing, instructions or templates. The book description and other reviewers do not mention this, leading me to believe that they were reviewing a companion book with the actual quilt information."
2,returned sofa cover,"Liked the material, however, had to send it back. It's a guessing game when ordering, because even though we have a queen sized sofa, no measurements were provided in the ad. Sure enough, the cover was way too big for our standard size queen sofa."
3,It's not bad but it's not good either,"I bought this to cover a large fake pleather sofa I inherited from the previous tenants.It is true to look, color, and fabric.I have two tortoise shell cats who shed and the fabric and color really show every hair.The cover also moves a lot and has to be put back into place after every sitting."
5,I bought it for an Airstream Travel Trailer,"It was a real bugger to put on at first, but once I got it on I really like it and it fits almost perfect.I got the sage color and it is a shade darker than I expected--but still looks OK.I would definitely recommend it, especially for a travel trailer with an 8ft sofa (bed) across the front window. (back or the sofa faces the hitch)"
2,Too stiff,"This slip cover was really big for my 80"" sofa and just too stiff. Seemed more like a burlap material than twill."
2,thinner and darker than expected,"I ordered the khaki color and it was more of a camel color. Darker than expected. I was also hoping for a thicker, durable fabric (almost like a denim). But this fabric is thinner. It won't be as durable as I'd hoped.On the plus side, it is soft."
4,Good quality. Hard build,"I bought this cane for my brother, but he did'n like it because he got it uncomfortable to Carey. Then, i gueesed that it cold be good for me. Now, i use the cane every day when i walk outdoors. It is hard and strong shock resistant. In Lima, Peru and anywhere this quality is so important to oír safety."
3,Strange Read,"This book is good in some ways (thus three stars): he is attempting a long overdue challenge to Modernism. The myriad of often humorous drawings point out well the concepts he is discussing. However, the strange construction of the book makes it harder to follow. It is like Krier could not focus for a coherent thought and broke everything up into tiny snippets. There is no ""essay"" longer than one page. More tragic is when he attempt to wade into theory. For example, he suggests that Kant's Categorical Imperatives are some sort of guideline, that by following that notion, that we build as if what we are building is a general principle; but of course that is exactly what the Moderns thought they were doing. FINALLY, I DO NOT AT ALL RECOMMEND THE TINY TRAVEL SIZE. IT IS TOO SMALL AND IMPOSSIBLE TO READ WITHOUT A MAGNIFYING GLASS. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?"
5,Just right,"I wear a full face mast,but need some camo make up for around my eye's. The tubes last much longer then the small compacts you can get. This kit comes with all three of the main colors you'll need. Having it in tubes will keep it fresh longer. I bought mine for turkey hunting were concealment is very important."
2,Poorly marked,"Fel-Pro usually has a great product. I am certain these seals would also carry the same quality. The only problem, but a major one, is that the set contains 16 seals and does not differentiate between the intake and exhaust. I had to buy a set from Acura to make sure everything worked ok. Not Amazons fault, but Fel-Pro's for not labeling correctly."
4,Minor Latin Master,"I bought this CD because I love the Guarnieri Symphonies performed and recorded by the same team. I'd never heard of Mignone before.Imagine if Respighi had lived in Brazil. (Respighi did, in fact, write a Brazilian piece after touring there). The Italian-born Mignone wrote in a similar vein. He was a deft orchestrator, the music is bright and enjoyable, not rhythmically or harmonically complex but orchestrally very sophisticated. The notes claim an African influence in the music, but this is true only in a Hollywood sense; it's far from the essence of Africa heard in the music of Kevin Volans, for example. Still, Hollywood has its place, and this record is good fun. If you enjoy the Criolla Cantata by Antonio Estevez (recorded by Mata on the Dorian label) you'll adore Mignone's choral ballet Maracatu de Chico Rei.This CD is well played and brilliantly recorded, as you'd expect from a BIS production. It's a guilty pleasure!"
5,Worth Buying,"This book is for all golfers, especially the serious ones. I was introduced to this book during my college golf team days, and still use it to teach at my club. If you are truly serious about your game, check out Pressure Games. Especially....to my fellow teaching pros."
3,Good hairspray for short hair,"I bought this hair spray hoping it would work under all weather conditions. I found that it did not work that well with a lot of wind. The can lasts for quite a while. For its low price, I recommend it as an inexpensive brand."
2,Eh,I think these songs might be great if performed better. Unfortunately I haven't found any other recordings yet...
3,Canto - An Opera,"If opera and its passion stirs you, then so will Canto. Because that's what this album is... opera.Gino's voice remains as strong and compelling as ever... but I'm sorry, I personally need the pace and rhythm of a real band cooking in the mix. Up through Nightwalker, Gino had it going on. The passion together with a rock arrangement that truly lit it up.I want to like this album... and I'm sure it'll curl the toes of many a fine babe... but for me it's just not working."
5,"Addicting, incredible, excellent, beautiful music & lyrics!","I have always been a fan and appreciated Mr. Vannelli's music. ""Canto"" however, is more than I can put into words. His voice and lyrics only get better. I am simply in awe of this latest release. I enjoy this CD so much, I bought a second copy so that I would have one in the house and one in the car. I listen to this CD daily and cannot get enough. I marvel at his voice, lyrics, composition, music and talent, which are displayed with this recent effort. ""Canto"" is certainly one of his finest works and only exemplifies his superb and incredible talent. I cannot wait for more!"
5,Classic and Beautiful,"Gino Vannelli is one of the best singers I have ever heard, and this CD is one of my favorites. It really shows his range, and his voice is presented beautifully in these songs. I heard him sing it in person, and he was wonderful. Any true Gino fan will love this CD."
5,Gino's canto,Great cd. Back to his italian roots. Great songs sung with his great voice and full of passion
3,Good but not for everybody,"Gino's music has always been evolving. He'llprobably never make the hot music that he didfor A&M. Growth, introspection, and great rangeof musical styles has always been his forte.It would be cool to see him do a country album oneday now that he's tackled virtually everything else.That said, his turn at classical pop on Cantois really not new. He's really been headed there since the jazzy 1995 release of Yonder Tree and already did a sessionfor side two of ""Pauper In Paradise"". Canto findsGino in great voice and lyrically grandiose. What'smissing is some juice. It's way to slow. It's funeralmusic. Even classical has some up-beat rhythms andthere are few to be found here. On the bright sideI got the idea this might be good foreplay, interplay,and afterplay for discerning lovers. I hope this isn'tthe last we hear of Gino and I hope the next effort ismuch more audience geared. Cheers!"
2,this is NOT a return to the jazz-fusion of his best work...F.Y.I.,"Gino hasn't really done anything that has knocked me out since the late 70's... I am interested more for the musicians and the grooves he once featured ...for the past 15 years it's been a lot of this romantic ballad stuff. Great, if you're a female looking for love and longing for romance, but please Gino, return to the ""Brother to Brother"" days or ""Storm at Sunup"". This sleepy stuff kinda bores me. I respect your choice to go in different directions and try new things, but let's put an edge on it please."
1,Doesn't smell like Hugo Boss no. 6 Cologne,"FYI - This product is equivalent to a Target or Walmart variety aftershave, such as Nivea, Neutrogena, or Gillette. The only reason I bought this was because I hoped it would match my Hugo Boss no. 6 Cologne, which I love. Instead, the product is mostly scent free, and the scent just smells like lotion.Bottom line:5 stars to Hugo Boss no. 6 Cologne0 starts for Hugo Boss no. 6 Aftershave"
5,Love it,It is nice to find a game for the computer that is like the dance revolution without having to buy a system.
2,DDR Dance Praise,"Very disappointed in the product. It has great music that my kids love, but they can't use their own metal dance mat. It doesn't say anywhere that I have read, but you must use the foam pad provided and you must use it on your computer. It doesn't hook into the TV like the other products on the market. I sure wish someone would make a Christian music product that works on the playstation!! The Christian market is huge, but this product just isn't as good as it needs to be to compete!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I like playing DDR/Stepmania and I find that the gameplay on Dance Praise is just not as good. This game has a lot to offer and there are plenty of interesting modes but the actual stepping to the beat just doesn't feel right. I can't put my finger on why but the DDR feel just isn't there. This game feels a bit ""dead"". So, in contrast to the other reviewer, I would say if you like DDR, you probably won't love this. The game is also far too forgiving! Yes, I know it's a Christian game but it doesn't have to be so easy. The problem is that the good steps score really highly, so you can miss loads of steps and still clear the round. I don't want to moan too much about this game because it has a lot going for it, including some interesting twists not found in similar games (and of course, wholesome music). It will definitely appeal to people who haven't played DDR, etc."
2,danceinohio,"I think this is hard for an adult, let alone a kid!! It can be fun and can get your heart raised, but sometimes the pad doesn't respond when you step on it making it very frustrating!"
1,Dance Praise 1 issues,I LOVED Dance Praise 1 yet had great issues with keeping the pad configured. My seller was awesome and credited me immediately for my return. I am grateful!
5,homeschool fun,"This has been great for winter activity in the house. we never have to worry about the music, and look forward to buying an additional mat."
4,An excellent resource,"I wish this book had existed when I was in high school! The chapters are very brief, so it's easy to read one a day or re-read one for a quick review. The example sentences used in the definitions not only clearly illustrate each usage, but cover a wide variety of topics. This is a user-friendly book whose informal teaching style will hold your attention."
4,Easy and interesting way to improve vocabulary,"This book adds enjoyment to the desire of every one to have good vocabulary strength. More we proceed with story more words we add to our word pool.I can summarise that, this is easiest way to enhance our vocabulary."
4,Good reading!,"The Devil's Oasis was my first read for Mr. Bull. It's a must for anyone who enjoys WWII era fiction. Although this book is the third in a series, it stands alone very well with its own character development and storyline. The historical references are plentiful and accurate, driving the story on well. I hope to see more like this."
5,easy way of Finding Money,"I have read alot of books that are concerning money, investing, loans, etc. But the best book that I have read is Finding Money, The Small Business Guide to Financing. This was written by Kate Lister and Tom Harnish. Finding Money is fantastic and this publication provides accurate and authoritative information. I would keep a copy of this book for references now and in the future. Good book, well worth buying."
3,"sharp, very sharp","We had tried several dishes of Italian gourmet when we were in Italy that contained Gorgonzola. Obviously, it must have been the ""dolce"" (sweet) variety. This is a very strong and sharp taste. I did not mind it at all in some recipes but the wife could not tolerate the overpowering taste. If you like authentic Gorgonzola, this is a delight. If you like authentic Blue Cheese, you defininately should try this."
1,Beware of dealing w/Allergy Be Gone.,"I buy a lot of these masks for work. For the second time, I purchased a few boxes from Allergy Be Gone. The first time, they switched the Plus masks out for the older style of 8210 (w/rubber bands). I had to return those first masks for a refund. The newer masks are more comfortable, protect longer. After drawing Amazon's scrutiny the first time. I thought perhaps they'd learned to deliver what they advertise. I guess not. It's about a year later, & they're still at it. What they are doing amounts to theft. It's a Bait & Switch. The older masks are cheaper. This Ad calls for a 60 count box of the Plus masks. That's NOT what you'll get. Allergy Be Gone didn't even bother to return my e-mail query this time. I've had to start a complaint claim through Amazon. Don't reward this kind of behavior."
2,Reading with Tequila,"Each one had at least one twist to the vampire lore that I had never seen before and enjoyed immensely. Unfortunately, while those four stories were exceptional, the remaining 25 were not. While none of the stories were bad, they all seemed to lack something new or different. They failed at grabbing my attention. 75 pages of some of the best vampire fiction I've ever read just isn't enough to carry the rest of this book."
3,"Good, Not Great Collection of Vampire Stories","Stephen Jones' collection of vampire fiction, ""The Mammoth Book of Vampires"" has a few really fun stories, but on the whole is just okay. Standouts in this collection are F. Paul Wilson's ""Midnight Mass"", Les Daniels' ""Yellow Fog"", and Kim Newman's ""Andy Warhol's Dracula, Anno Dracula 1978-79"". Some others provide their share of chills, but there are some real stinkers here. One particular disappointment was the offering ""Vampire"" by the son of Richard Matheson, which reads like bad poetry, having nothing at all to do with vampires. This might be just one to check out of the library."
1,mammoth book of why vampire stories can be lousy,"original? please. uninventive. the vampire hunter. the vampires taking over. same old, same old. and if you don't have a story, don't write. a good story be chetwynd-hayes. not so bad by Barker. other than that..... Like to add that i don't hate vampires. i just hate recycling, vampire clans, so-called exciting intrigues, and melodrama."
5,Nick Carter is the finest thing to walk the earth!,"Nick Carter of the BackStreet Boys, in my opinion, is the best singer alive. Not to mention he is the hottest guy on earth! This C.D. rocks!"
5,The BSB have the best music u can get.,The BSB have the best music u can get. Thay r the kind off group that will stay around for ever. You see I sing and I here a lot off music and they r the best group. Any body who wants to be famose should look up at the BSB because they where just like u and me normal every day people but then they became stars and they followed ther dream. This is where they will be now and forever. I love the BSB they rock.
1,false advertising,"despite what the amazon listing for this DVD says, it is NOT a region 1 disc and will probably not play in your DVD player. amazon seems to have a long term problem with getting these sorts of details right in their listings."
1,Too small,"If this is for a child ok, but it won't fit an adult. The beading isn't real either, it's drawn on."
5,a book that touches the heart,"This book, by Annie Weissman, is a MUST READ. It is the author's personal story of loss and gain written in a gripping style. Once you pick it up you will not want to put it down until you have finished.The book evokes tears and laughter. You will love reading ""As One Door Closes..."" if you have children in your life, if you have close friends, if you have ever had to endure the death of a loved one, if you need inspiration to get to the other side of pain.Annie Weissman, an accomplished author of non-fiction books, writes in a style that reaches into your heart and soul. Her details of family moments and personal struggles make her story relevant to all readers.This is a superb book for yourself and as a gift to friends."
1,Perhaps a bit misleading,"I recently purchased the book ""As one door closes"" since I had lost two people on flight #255. I expected to hear a lot of details about the event itself, but was suprised to discover that it was about the authors life up to and after the event. Again, my interest was in the events surrounding the accident, etc. Also since one four year old survived, I thoufght it might be her story. I essence I felt I was misled by the title."
5,Had a Good Time: Stories from American Postcards,"I really enjoyed this book. The stories are imaginative leaps from the few real lines from various old postcards collected by the author. He is currently working on a book based on one of the stories in the book, ""The One in White"" which promises to be a good read."
5,Excellent book,If you watch lots of TV and never read the bible then this book is not for you. If you are diligently searching for the truth of God's words then this is for you. I went to a state college for two years and have a masters degree in the Bible. I also studied the bible versions issue for one year and this book is in my library. I recommend it to any who are serious about the bible and Jesus.
4,Essential Ray Price,"The #1 CD is his old stuff, and while it is good, it is definitely old. Many changes in recording technology. #2 CD is some of his more modern stuff and it is technically better, as far as recording technology goes, and it really showcases the quality of this man's voice. While I like both CDs, I am very partial to the second one.Jerry M"
5,Great collection of the Master's recordings,This spans a majority of his career and includes pretty much all the hits. A very talented artist that is still touring and recording. They don't make them like him anymore!!
2,Disappointed in quality,"The CD gets stuck in the middle of songs and I need to press the ""Play"" button in order for it to continue playing. I've only listened to the first two songs because this is so annlying."
3,just troubles,Tuve problemas con la compativilidad de las tarjetas de video estaba tratando de instalar una fx7950 EVGA y jamas pude tener un desempeño apreciable................mejor cambie esta mobo por una micro EVGA SLI
1,Waste of money,You can get the same technical datathat is in the book from the infothat comes with the film. Thephotographs are not that great either.Don't waste your money on this book.Any other book on infrared photographyis surely better than this.
1,This is not really a good photo book,"The photos are mediocre, and all high key, and the cover photo is the best. The how to of using infrared film is sorely lacking, it is summed up as 'try it and figure it out for your camera'. The helpful hints are how IR is seen by the film, and what the red dot focus mark on a manual focus lens was for. As with most subjects you can search get the information on the internet, but some books have photos and invaluable reference information. This book, however, is not worth owning; and the print date of this book has nothing to do with how poor I thought this book was."
3,A Book To Love or Hate,"Gob's Grief is beautiful, sensitive, insightful, moving, repetitive, convoluted, a little too ""artful,"" and (as one reviewer said) ""wonderous strange."" If you like this kind of thing, you'll give this book five stars. If you want a story that makes sense, or has realistic (and sane) characters and a reasonable progression from beginning to end, you'll have a hard time getting through it. I am in the latter group."
5,Gob's Grief,"I purchased this book because our book club is reading it this month. Unfortunately I have not finished the novel as of today, but continue to read and enjoy it."
2,"Mostly trashy, with a little good writing","""Gob's Grief"" by Chris Adrian is a very ambitious first novel that tries to explore the Civil War, and the question of the afterlife, but Adrian falls flat on his face with the spiritualist crap that has been overdone to death. Basically, Gob Woodhull, fictional son of the real Victoria Woodhull, an early feminist, tries to bring back his dead brother, who died at 11 in war. The prose in this book usually borders on ridicious. I mean, really, did anybody really see an eleven year old as a proper solider? Anyway, Gob and a cast of other characters build a weird machine, bring a weird boy named Pickie to life. Then Pickie helps to build a large weird machine, and they use that to bring Tomo back. The ending is interesting, but the rest of the book is tedious crap. Adrian could have done much better."
3,Just OK,"I bought these boots to replace my Thorogood Force Recon boots that I have been wearing for years and which have apparently been discontinued. These boots are OK, but I will be looking for something more comfortable when I replace these."
4,Enjoying it,"Bought it for my son who is resistant to anything pencil and paper. He can't get enough of this. However, a cat called sex kitten doesn't fly with me. The editors should know their target population better."
5,From the Beginning,"From the beginning of this book to the end, it is filled with (finally) basic, step-by-step instructions on drawing cartoon people, body parts, the ""action line"", body language and style. And then it starts all over again with animals! Mostly dogs, cats, and different fowl, it also includes less common animals, like beaver, porcupine, raccoon and many sea animals. Can't forget the great alligators and dragon. Finally, the book spends time on placing the characters, reference lines and specialty shots and the all-important ""balloon"". Another great one by C. Hart. I think I own most of his books and they are all worth great merit, better than the other books I've seen out there by far."
1,13th floor elevator,the same psychedelic instrument and same sound on each song after you hear one bad song you've heard them all
5,Axis of Evil CD - definitely worth getting,"I really enjoyed this CD. I am a fan of Underground Inc, and Pigface, and this is yet another CD that has come out of the Underground Inc./Invisible Records label that is simply outstanding. Nocturne is a truly remarkable band."
1,"Its nocturne, like you expected much?","Yet another release from nocturne, this has to be one of the worlds worst female fronted bands of today, horrible music, horrible vocals. At least this CD is remixed by other artists so it doesn't quite suck on the same level as a full Nocturne release, too bad they didn't replace the singer when they did this CD.This is NOT Goth, this is NOT Industrial, this isn't anything close to either, this is just bad 80's type rock with really bad female vocals. Save your moeny, I know I wish I had!"
5,30 something hip hop parents will love this!,"If you are a TRUE hip hop parent then you'll love this CD for your kids. They get the flavor of hip hop without the garbage in today's music. Great beats. My 3 year old son loves this and even has his sitter singing, ""Shoulder Lean""."
3,If you can't find the Posh Boy release . . .,"Go with this. It's a shame though that Alejandro Escovedo and Mike Varney were both gone by the time this came out, Al to play in Rank and File with the Kinman Brothers (late of the Dils) and Mike to found Shrapnel Records.It sounds a bit more new wave than punk, but still, the Nuns were one of the first California Punk bands and they, along with the equally great Avengers, opened for the Pistols at their swansong in San Francisco.What are you waiting for? It's the Nuns, buy either one and your life will be better for it.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
4,What a great review page!,"We did ""license"" this album and another 5 classic Posh Boy titles that were re-issued on CD by Get Back/Abraxas in 2005. The problem was that the Italians never paid the agreed upon advance and neither asked us for nor were sent the master tapes. So I am not surprised they mastered from vinyl (if from cassette, that's just too unbelievable!). But as others have stated, the packaging is awesome, gatefold CD sleeve with the disc itself looking like a minature LP. We hope to get the best quality digital versions up on iTunes in the near future.Incidentally the reviewer by name of Jennifer Anderson speaks with absolute authority on The Nuns."
5,"Everything you wanted to know about chant, etc","This is a complete book describing anythinganyone would every like to know about chant, the development of music notation, etc., with information about Western European midieval music as well as other midieval music. It is a great resource for the music historian."
1,Highly Dated,"The buyer should be aware that this book was written in 1912. For the time, it isn't bad, but nearly a century has passed with significant technological advances that this book does not cover. If you are after it for its historical flavor, fine; otherwise, you may prefer looking elsewhere."
2,my watch,I've had this watch for almost one year. The light does not work anymore.Isent it to timex for repair.It probably is the battery and thats not under warranty ps I think it's a nice looking watch that's why I bought it
5,Gotta love the oldies,Everyone needs their own copy of this series of cd's. Brings back some great memories from the past and great tunes as well.
2,Rusted,First time out with this knife on a live aboard the knife blade was rusted after only three days. Like the strap clips.
4,Balanced Knife,"Very nice knife to hold in our hand! Very Comfortable and ehhh.. pretty sturdy. Super sharp out of the box! The straps suck, clicks and locks nicely into place but after a couple presses feels like its gonna break; i suggest buying better straps so you dont lose it in the ocean or whatever your doing. Was skeptical about buying this knife because everyone keep saying it rust this and that. JUST READ THE PACKAGING... it says after every use, dis-assmeble and clean with fresh water and apply mineral oil... its not that hard guys. Over all 4 stars and minus one for the straps."
2,It broke after 1 day,Blade is very sharp and knife seemed to be very well designed and constructed. After one day of diving the clip that holds the knife in the sheath broke rendering it useless as a dive knife. It just falls out of the sheath. I was bragging about my knife the entire trip to my buddies but wound up having to borrow one of their cheap backup knifes for the remaining of our dive trip.
4,This knife and it's holster work.,"This is a nice knife. It's not high quality but it's as good as you could expected for the price. I situated the straps on my calf and I can spearfish for hours with out thinking about it. The release mechanism is easy use with one hand but it feels secure. I went out for a long time and there was a little rust near handle (not on Sharp edge) I scrubbed it and oiled it. I get the impression that if I treat it very well, clean it and oil it after every use i'll like it and it'll last me but if I get lazy it'll be rusted in a couple of months."
2,Dive knife,"En realidad no me gusto sus materiales, no es adecuado para el buceo. I dont like this knife, is very bad the quality, this knife no is for dive specialI dont recomend this productNo recomiendo este producto ,"
2,"Great customer srvice, poor product","I bought one a few years back and had to have it replaced after 6 months.The replacement I received needed to be replaced 8 months later.Today the replacement is needing a replacement.The only fun thing is calling Tech Support and hearing someone named ""Steven"" speaking English with a Indian accent. They are however very professional and quick to fix the problem.The problems were mainly bad battery time, loss of tracking ability, inability to work off a USB hub, and a handful of other hardware issues.Knowing what I know I'd give it a pass!"
1,Worst mouse I've ever bought,"Do not buy this mouse! I have not found a PC that it works with yet. The response speed from button clicks is so sluggish, I can not use it. No amount of tweaking the control panel settings will enable this mouse to be useful."
1,Keep a backup corded mouse,"I agree with the other reviewers that the scrollpad is tricky to use -- unlike a mouse wheel, you really can't predict how far it's going to scroll. And I also had problems with clicks not registering. If you push it too lightly, the mouse still makes a definite clicking noise, but doesn't send a click to the computer.But the worst problems were with not fitting well in the cradle, not charging while it sat there, not staying charged, and then not even working at all when it claimed to be fully charged. I found myself having to plug in the old broken mouse that I had meant to replace with this mouse, because the new mouse sometimes just would not work.After two months with this mouse I went out and bought a corded Microsoft optical mouse that cost half as much, and I'm much, much happier with it. The Studio Mouse Wireless was almost a daily hassle to use."
2,"All the lights were on, but...","I have the wired version of this mouse, and I am a fan of Kensington's mice--heck, besides Apple's, I have never used another brand. But I digress...I was disappointed by this mouse for a couple of reasons:1. Instead of charging via USB--which could be done--the dock for the mouse has an AC adaptor which plugs into the USB plug. It just looks awkward.2. The mouse is not very responsive. Often, I would have to click twice for a menu or dock item to be selected. Scrolling long menus was a joke since the mouse would disengage before scrolling the entire menu.I was disappointed, and I returned it immediately. I love the design of the Studio Mouse, so I am using the wired version again."
2,Not for pros,"Kensington markets this Mouse as the must have for graphics pros, I found it's tracking to be very impresise and jerky. I tried to use it for 3 weeks and finally gave up. Also graphics pros use Mac OS X and the coolest features don't work in OS X. Stick to the wire."
3,"Different, but so what","Liked the design and uniqueness of this mouse when I saw it online.Once I got it, it wasn't as comfortable as I'd hoped and not very good tracking features. It eventually died after about 6 months.I generally like Kensington products, but I'd say is okay if you want something new and different, but for the price it isn't worth it."
1,big tracking delay,"I was warned by someone that a friend had bought one of these and returned it because of the delay. I went ahead and bought it thinking I could adjust the tracking speed to something I liked...it didn't work. The pointer is behind all movements, and at the fastest settings, once it does get moving, it jumps and hops. I'm taking it back. Don't waste your time."
1,"Terrible, stiff fabrics.","In the package, the comforter looked lovely; good color, interesting texture. Nice, long bed skirt. However, the fabric covering the comforter and the pillow shams is very stiff and abrasive. This is not a usable piece of bedding. It is an insult to the buyer that Westpoint Stevens would put their name on an item of such miserable quality."
2,"looks nice, but terrible indeed","I just received the comforter set. But I just feel kind of dispointing. First, all the materials (not only the shams) is very ""stiff and abrasive"" (I noticed the review after I placed the order~~). Second, it is kind of dirty that small ""macula"" on the surface of the comforter, shams and every thing. I guess this comforter is pretty old, and the materials goes bad due to its age."
3,"Vigorous Performance, So-so Recording","This is one lively 'Elias' conducted by Kurt Masur, possibly the speed record holder for this great oratorio, coming in at 110 minutes, which is 20-30 minutes shorter than most performances. What it loses in emotional impact, it gains somewhat in coherence. Alistair Miles, a bass, is a fine Elijah, and doesn't strain to hit the low notes. The other soloists and MDR Leipzig Choir are very good too. Masur's interpretation is on the routine side. The performance is in German, and a libretto is enclosed. The main thing keeping this from being a great CD is the recording job. It was done live in Tel Aviv from a series of concerts, and it is not very resonant or spacious. Additionally, there is more noise from the audience and performers than there ought to be in a disc that retails for over $30. Rustling, the occasional cough, and some huffing and puffing are all things I have sadly learned to expect from Teldec. Too bad they didn't do better."
2,"The Pine nuts were not clean and contained a lot of stones, twigs and even some bugs.","The Pine nuts were not clean and contained a lot of stones, twigs and even some bugs.Also the taste was not as I expected. Can't wait for Costco to start selling their Pine nuts again..."
3,not very romantic at all,"I'm sorry to say this, but I thought this book was crummy. After reading and enjoying Washington Avalanche and San Fransisco Earthquake I thought I'd find a good read in this one. No such luck! I felt that this story had the potential to be good but got quite boring. Russell wasn't nearly as exciting as some of the men in the book--he wasn't any fun. I didn't think he was the sort of man Katina would like at all. I found myself skimming through parts of this book and overall I was quite disappointed."
3,just like any other historical romance...,"this book was not quite what i imagined it to be. the plot fits into your stereotypical historical romance: girl dresses up as guy, meets cute guy, falls in love with guy, and decides to reveal her 'true self' to him. guy decides he loves her, competes for her affection, assumes that girl likes the other guy better, ""oh break, my heart"" blah blah. in the end, the girl and guy get together after going through a historical disaster. i'll give this to ms. massie -- the event is described in great detail and is given a lot of attention, which is good if you like that kind of thing. the romance definitely needs more spark [for lack of a better word.]"
5,This Book (and its Author) Influenced Us Tremendously.,"My husband and I attended a one-month training held by Dr. Donald Smith, the author of this book. This text was required reading before attending the seminar. It was an excellent synopsis of his lifetime of learning as an overseas worker. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to know how to become better for cross-cultural ministry."
1,Bad dvd,I agree wiry the other reviewer. I bought this DVD and it would not play anywhere. Waste of money
1,doesn't play,I ordered this and it would not play on my computer or dvd player. I exchanged it for another one and the same thing happened. I had no problems with the returns but was frustrated that neither worked.
3,so close... but just a bit too cheesy,The guitar work is SO beautiful on this CD! I really love it (and it is hard to find truly relaxing guitar...) but the flute part is obviously done on a synthesizer and that makes it sound cheesy. I would LOVE this album without the fake flute sounds... or with a real flute. Does anyone know who the guitar player is?
5,Table for One is the better title!,"Becky De never looked or acted better. A good ""off the wall"" movie is a rare thing, and this is a very good one! How many movies never let you know what is going to happen next throughout the movie, while keeping you emotionally involved?"
3,Not good,"Definitely a B movie in my opinion. A cheating husband and a mentally warped wife 'love' each other, but at the same time plot to kill each other. Could have been interesting, but it isn't. In short, the plot was weird, weak and just plain awful. Unless Rebecca De Mornay is your absolute dream girl and you must see her, don't waste 1 hr 50 min watching this garbage. 20% of the audience on rottentomatoes liked it. That should tell you something."
1,Oh Rebecca say it ain't so,"Well, we all know Michael Rooker is sometimes in goodstuff ( like ""The Bone Collector"" ) and more often invery ropey stuff like this, but to see Rebecca DeMornayin such a bad bad movie is just too much. I can hardlybelieve this is the same woman from ""Feds"", ""Risky Business"",""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" and the underrated ""Dealers"".She is too beautiful to get stuck in B-movie dreck like this.Please Rebecca, get back in a good movie soon."
2,Buy a 2x teleconverter or extension rings instead.,"Don't be cheap if you want good macro close up shots.This kind of product does what it says but at the cost of DOF, color clarity and over all lighting.If you use all three rings combined you get a very misty and ghost like image. The edges of which look like the effect you see on old camera black and white shots, where the outside edges of the shot fade into white.DOF? almost null. This is expected on Macro shots, but not as accentuated as what you get with these close up filters."
4,Good product,the product gives what it promises... only problem i found is that u have to get extra close to the subject to take the picture.. so this would be problematic for insects and live close-ups.. but for plant and coins it is fine. its hard to take pics when there is not enough light as there will be a cast shadow most of the time from the size of the lens so you have to find the perfect angle to shoot at.
3,Review on Bower Digital Macro Filter Kit,"I used this with Nikon D70s. When I saw through the view finder the image was very sharp. But when I took the image, it was not very satisfactory. This is due to very very less depth of focus. Need lot of patience and perfectence to use this at very close distances. Using lens up to +4 is ok more than that is difficult to manage."
5,Great Photography DVD,"I never grow tired of watching this dvd. Nature and Environmental Photography is tough and National Geographic photographers are a rare breed. Whether at a rodeo or picking up deadly illnesses in a foreign land to get the shot, Joel is on the job. I had never heard of Joel, but really like his honesty, humanity, and humbleness. Thanks to both NG and Joel Satore. Keep up the good work. And by the way, Joel's photography is amazing."
1,Not the same as the photo,I paid extra to have the camo in the photo. The product that was shipped is the cheap stuff that doesn't have any netting!
5,Smooth Shave,"This product was introduced to me by my brother-in-law and I must say that I was skeptical at first that it would be effective. Needless-to-say, I have ordered this product. With just a small bead of this cream, I get a very close shave without the 'razor rash' I normally do with other products. I highly recommend trying it."
2,TOO much fragrance added when they reformulated,"This product was lovely. They added ""more moisturizing"" and now it stings my face.I will be trying and reviewing the unsecented."
3,Its Organic but doesnt foam up,I liked the smell of it. But i need to use lots of quantity to get it to work. And the only sad part is that it doesnt foam at all. But leaves u with a smooth shave. HOpe this helps.
5,At last,This stuff rocks. You need only a small amount to shave your whole face and it helps reduce razor burn. I highly recomend it.
3,just ok,"Tori is a fireball of a live performer. I have seen her live in concert nearly a dozen times and was floor by every performance I had seen of hers. This set, this performance, is nothing like I have seen, even when seeing her solo. This is not a not a taste of her performing prowess at all! Her voice was strained from a massive world tour, and it shows. The performances of Virginia, Wednesday and Toast are very, very good, though. I just wished she had recorded something live from the 2010/11 tours, because those would more accurately show how talented she really is. This dvd is a safe performance, albeit, probably the nature of the Artist Den series, but it's not an accurate depiction of what a great live act Tori is."
4,Surprised,"I was prepared to dislike this. She only played one song I actually like. The rest are okay or on my list of least favorite. However, to my surprise, this presentation highlighted these girls really well. I haven't seen the whole performance but songs I did here were performed beautifully and in a way that touched me like the studio recordings couldn't. Now I ""understand"" the songs a little more and can even appreciate the original recordings of these songs more. I can't wait to see the rest of this."
2,Not Great..Not Even Good :(,"I have to agree with Cliff and his review. The songs were slowed down, the piano wasn't played as strongly and her voice was off. It reminds me of the The Beekeeper tour. Tori has great/strong vocal ability as heard on the 2010 solo tour - those shows were outstanding.This is just very bland and does not show off Tori's talent much at all. I gave it two stars for the performance of Virginia and the interviews only, the rest seems like filler material."
2,Tori is getting older,"I think this is the worst CD/DVD of hers that I have purchased. All her songs sounded SLOW and basically dead. She seemed to pick things up toward the end a little but not enough for me to recommend this to anyone. Possibly, it was due to the small audience - I think that she feeds off the audience more than most and the audience was pretty subdued and reverant in this setting."
1,Please do not waste your money,"I have been an Amazon customer for more years than I care to count and until now I have NEVER returned a book! The prompts in this book (e.g., ""Our family drives"" ""God and I talk when"" ""When I'm older I want to live"") are in no way thought provoking and as a result do not elict any level of self-discovery. Most people, even children, already know what bugs them, or about their favorite holiday.Because this book is written for, in addition to children, adolescents and adults I certainly would have expected prompts that require the reader to really look within. If this is what you are looking to do, this is not the book for you.As a psychotherapist, I purchased it for my patients but had even hoped I would personally enjoy a few of the chapters but needless to say this was not the case.One might use this book to learn more about the person responding to the prompts, but the reader is unlikely to discover anything new about him or herself."
5,fancy feet review,"I thought this book was pretty good. I liked how Stacey's kindergarten class was having a store. I thought that it was a good idea. It was cute when Stacey snooped in Mrs. Zachary's desk and found the fake money to spend at the store. Mrs. Zachary is Stacey's teacher. I liked when kids brought in stuff for the store such as teddy bears,banks, books, and other things. I reccomend this book."
3,Akrikaans-English Dictionary,"It is very useful, but I could use even more words in it! I would like larger print too. This would mean a more expensive book, but I wuld buy it."
2,Looks cool but quality is way to low!,Poor guy did not last even overnight. I low quality toy that gets tangled in it's own shoot just from looking at it. Sadly another junk.
4,a toolbox to set near your ministry bookshelf,This really is what the title calls it -- a set of tools for both practical and active Christians: laity and clergy alike. This book fills in many of the nuts-and-bolts gaps of a seminary education (but with theological appropriateness!). The best book Herb's ever written...maybe that'll spur him to write some more!
1,vil copia,"no puse cero estrellas porque no está esa opción. me parece que quiso copiarse de RuPaul, solo que Billy More no tiene ese algo especial que tenia RuPaul, el es solo un travesty mas del montón, y la canción tampoco no tiene nada de especial, ¿Up and down? no se les pudo haber ocurrido algo menos original.RuPaul es el #1"
2,Waste of money,"Don't bother with this. Yes, it warms the wipes but in the short short time it takes to take the wipe out of the warmer and onto the baby the wipe is cool again. I guess the wipe is not a cold as it would be if it was never in the warmer - which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one."
1,BIG waste of money....,"This and the ultimate wipes warmer where two of the things that I purchased right away because I had read all of the reviews and everyone said they were ""lifesavers"". Well, out of all of the items I have purchased these two were the BIGGEST waste of money and are more of an inconvenience than anything. This warmer needs to be plugged in to stay warm and when unplugged does not stay warm for long. If using these items make sure you always have a warm wipe because your little one gets use to the warm wipes which is not always so convenient when your on the go or traveling. My advice is save your money and buy something your baby REALLY needs."
5,Works great!,I love this product. Wipes are kept warm and never dries out. My baby loves the warm wipes. I like that it has dual adapter for car and home.
3,Used for about a week.,"We used this for about a week or two. And then we realized it's pointless and useless. Besides, cold wipes build character."
3,can't really say,I gave this as a gift but the parents have not used it. She said she has a bigger warmer she uses in the home and has not had the need to use it. So my rating is it is a frivious gift that is rarely needed for moms in a rush. Although grand mothers would love to have it when they babysit.
2,can do without,"As a new mother, I wanted to get everything that would make the baby comfortable. As the months go by, I realized that there are some things I could have done without... this is one of the things. Quite frankly, I think it drys out the wipes, and only warms the first two on top."
5,Wonderful Luxury,"Although I do consider this a luxury, not a necessity, I love it! We live in an old, drafty house and even though our newborn daughter didn't seem to mind cold wipes, they bothered me. This unit sits on our changing table and works perfectly. The first several wipes are just the right temperature and always moist. I've never had a problem with wipes drying out, overheating or getting cold. I just refill the unit every few days. It does work in the car and it's great on long trips. However, when the unit is unplugged mine cools off rapidly. So, I don't bother to carry it in the diaper bag (but I probably wouldn't even if it did keep them warm). When plugged in with the ac adapter the plug buzzes audibly (transformer? heating element?), but we're used to that. This warmer is absolutely maintenance free (aside from refilling the wipes). Don't waste your time and money on those other units. This one is wonderful."
4,New Wave era hits,"The 1980 - 1984 edition of the #1 RADIO HITS * ONLY ROCK 'N ROLL series is a solid collection of twenty great sounding sides. This Warner Special Products CD is sure to please anyone who remembers those years, or any fan of 80s TOP 40 radio.Liner notes are forsaken for catalog advertising.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 75:32"
2,There was a reason why it was never released in the states,"I was a big fan of OMD, still consider myself to be a big fan... to a degree. This CD, however, is just downright awful. Aside from *VERY* choice cuts, the whole album just reeks of formulated pop crap. Walking on the Milky Way and Too Late are the two standouts, the rest of the stuff leaves you wondering if Sting ended up joining the band or if Michael Bolton decided on creating a ""hard edged"" easy listening album. I was surprised to find the album was not going to be released in the states, but after obtaining an import copy and giving it a listen... it's not too hard to understand why. If you want truly good OMD work, check out Sugar Tax or the Best-of compilations. I'll leave this release to the die-hards to figure out."
2,A Joke compared to Sugartax,"This was their last ditch effort and all I can say is good riddance. After their Sugartax album they started going down hill from their and started to become more of a funky newage/soft music group than the electronic dance/pop group they started out as. If this was their plan, they should have changed their name and started reaching out to a different kind of audience and left their long time fans wanting more right at the top of their success with their Sugartax album."
4,"The truth is out there, but it's not what you think","Peebles' book is a refreshing alternative to the fevered productions of the UFO industry. He brings historical research and a healthy skepticism to a field overgrown with mass-market pop-culture faith and credulity. His ""rational"" explanations are sometimes pat and unconvincing, or he doesn't offer any. But of course this book will never sell as well as the alienist popular media, because the alien myth is so entertaining and for some, religiously fulfilling. As Peeble amply documents, belief in the alien origins of UFOs is a matter of faith, and a product of the human hunger for transcendence."
4,Are you a believer? You won't after reading this.,"Is Peebles a government stooge? Is this book an attempt at disinformation to throw of the scent? If you believe that, you'll believe anything.Apparently some people do.This book is a fine attempt to show how the crackpot theories and people gain prominence through fraud, misunderstanding, or desperately wanting to believe that something other than us is out there. Sceptics will love it, believers will hate it, but only because they are shown to be the fools that they are. Peebles shows that there is no proof of UFOs, EBEs or secret governments. The UFO industry has too much invested for people to believe in anything else."
3,"Some good history, but skepticism not clearly explained","The book has some good history and background information, but as a pro-explorationist, I found it was not well-reasoned skepticism."
2,Useless,"This book is geared narrowly towards Church groups. I bought this book on Amazon, and I never knew that it was for Churches until I received the book. I figured there might be ideas in the book that could work for my organization as well. You'd think there would be, but there wasn't. Even if my organization WAS a church group, there are few feasible fundraising options in this book. It is unrealistic as far as fundraising goes."
5,These last forever,"I bought an SE-82-6 about 15 years ago. I long since lost the manual and went online to find one, knowing that I probably would be unsuccessful...after all it was a 15 year old product. I was surprised to see they're still on the market, but really it's no surprise. Mine differs only from the dial background, from what I can tell. The point is I have used this regularly for ages, keep it stored in a dusty area, have gotten it wet, and have dropped it many times, yet I'm charging a mower battery with it as we speak. Maybe this is a special case, but 15+ years on a charger that I have, uh, not exactly taken good care of is outstanding."
5,Great for Electrolysis,I used this for electrolysis to remove rust from auto parts of an old VW I was fixing up. Worked great. Definately have to get a charger that is manual.
3,Works OK.,I have had only one opportunity to use this charger. I believe that the battery maybe bad. I will try again!
3,Voltage mixed up,"I have one of these already that works great but on this one, the 2 amp 6v setting is acurate. The 2 amp 12v setting actually produces 9v which will not charge your car battery. The 6 amp 12v setting is acurate."
1,Defective and dangerous,Charger arrived broken. The insides were clearly not attached to anything and rattling around. I am afraid to even attempt to use this for fear of serious damage to the battery or damage to myself. This is clearly not a safe product to use in the condition it arrived in.
5,Tools,I have one of these chargers and a friend of mine wanted to borrow it. I got him his own instead. He is tickled pink and for the price is so well made and does a great job.
1,bad,Bought this item from amazon. Charger worked fine for about two months... then quit for no reason. What a piece of junk!!!
3,Does the job bottom line,While it does the job bottom line a simple revamp of how the face plate is attached I suspect it a bent tab system which is loose fitting and cheapens it. But so far no complaints.... I bought it expressly for the rider mower and it fits that purpose well...
3,Not Bad,Chaper build than I had hoped for - the front panel moves and the unit just feels cheap. Then again it was inexpensive and it did charge a totally dead battery (I wanted a manual charger for batteries that couldn't be charged with my smart charger).
2,"Manual, not automatic","Was looking for a trickle charger for a 12-volt battery and thought from the advertising on the box that this one might do the job. If I'd known more about chargers, the word ""manual"" would have clued me in, but if you're as inexperienced as I was--this does not have an automatic shutoff. Also, I find the gauge unnecessarily hard to interpret, with its two-way graph. A much simpler and smaller trickle charger is the Shumacher SEM 1562A/SFM 1562A."
3,It's manual,"You must pay attention to the description of the charger before ordering. I assumed it to be an automatic charger which it is not. Mea culpa, next time I'll be more thorough reading the description before placing an order."
4,Very good lights,"I wanted high quality lights to go on my truck that can stand up to the harsh winter conditions I put them thru. These work great. My main complaint is that the wiring from the light to the harness is too short so you cant hide the wiring in your bumper or under a brushguard! MAJOR design FLAW! most people use these on a Brush guard, and the approx 6"" wiring from the light to the harness is not long enough to be placed/hidden out of the way so its not visible. Performance wise they are great, just from the cosmetic side they get 2 stars, so they balance out to a 4 star vote from me."
5,Size?,"Can anyone that has purchased these piaa's please give me the correct dimensions.The dimensions mentioned on the site say they are 1""x1""x1""????"
4,Good but not the best,This is one of the best Chopin Etudes showpieces but it seems to me that Pollini's one shows better technique while Cortot's one is more musical. Still finding one which can combine both for the Chopin I love.
3,A solid album,"I don't own other Anathema albums yet, and I haven't listened to any songs in other album. But this is a solid album. It opens with the AOR ""Deep"" which has an awesome guitar. After, there is ""Pitiless"", with a good melody. Then, goes ""Forgotten Hopes"", a slow ballad. One of my favourites. Then there are three excellent tracks (""Destiny Is Dead"", ""Make It Right"" and ""One Last Goodbye""). After comes ""Parisienne Moonlight"", and ""Judgement"" which is the best song in the album. After there is the moderate ""Don't Look Too Far"". I don't like this song very much. Then there are good songs, especially ""Wings Of God"". An enjoyable track. Fans must buy this album."
5,Transcendental Progressive at it's Finest,I may be biased but I love the movement AnathemA made from metal to melodic; Judgement is one of my favourite albums.Much of the lyrics are heartfelt and ring true to those who have experienced similar events in their lives. The music is melodious and poetic and the sound matches Cavanagh's expressive tonal qualities.I would highly recommend this album to newcomers of the band or fans of similar styles like Antimatter.
5,Amazing psychedelic metal ballads,"First of all if you like pink Floyd and metal then this is an album that you surely love as i do. All the songs are great and there is a melancholic feeling (I dont recommend hearing this album every day as is a little depressing).This guys must have a lot of rejections from women , once you look at their lyrics you automatically understand this. But the production and the way the instruments sounds are really great , so great that makes this album a masterpiece and a unique album."
5,Awesome X-men!,"This is so totally awesome that I don't even know where to begin!!! Beyond Good and Evil is so totally freaking awesome!!! Do you like X-men? If you do then you're gonna love this one! This is the best of the series. Even if you don't know about the X-men, you're bound to enjoy this. Great for boys from 8-92. If you've got a kid inside you then you'll love this stuff. I don't want to ruin any of the stories but Beyond Good and Evil is so great. There's time travel, there's drama, there's a little comedy. Well rounded script."
5,Great old school fun,that says it all. nice action. ton of superheros besides the X-Men. great for kids and adults.
5,Awesome!!! when is Volume 5 Coming Out?,It's great to finally have a decent copy of the original X-Men Animated Series from the 1990's. This collection contains my favourite saga Beyond Good & Evil.I would highly reccomend this to any X-Men Fan.
5,Not What Some Want to Hear,"If you are concerned about the homosexual assault on morality, you will appreciate this book. It is very thorough and well-researched. Those concerned with the moral meltdown of U.S. society should read this book."
2,Agenda twists author's perspective,"I'm met F. Legard Smith, and used to be associated with the church that has influenced his thinking. As a professor of law at Pepperdine University, he should be ashamed -- because, of all people, he is best equipped to recognize the baseless arguments and deliberate illogic that make up the bulk of this book. Appealing always to emotion (but never to logic), Smith engages in a shameless manipulation of his audience in an effort to shock them into action. Even so, the book is an excellent textbook for those seeking insight into the extremes to which even the ""educated"" fundamentalist right will go to in service to their agenda"
1,A complete waste of time,"This book made me sick. It does nothing but completely bash the GLBT community that has done nothing what-so-ever to harm anyone else. Homosexuality has ALWAYS been present. There is nothing wrong with it, it isnt some sort of disease. Being gay is not about the lust between two men or women. Its about being true to yourself and accepting yourself for who you are. Its about the love between two people, even if they are of the same sex...Please, if you have any moral values at all, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!"
3,Not a comprehensive book for SOC design,"The book explains the fundamentals for design and methodology of SOCs. It also addresses the design reuse concerns. However, the book does not cover practical examples of SOC design and does not explain the difference between ASICs and SOCs."
2,Its not that great.,"I have owned this cassette player for 3 months now. For the price , it is decent if you also believe the short durability of all cassette players. MY rants: 1. Biggest complaint is that mega bass is more like puny bass. Liked my old Panasonic better. 2. The power button on the front easily turns on by accidental contact. Unless you pull out the batteries after every use, expect to waste alot of $ on batteries. 3. Although it hasn't broken for me YET, the battery door is cheap and looks very breakable; esp in light of pulling out batteries when not in use. 4. For some reason, my cassette player keeps shuttling forward to reverse playback when it is cold. When it warms up, it resumes its normal function. Must be averse to cold.Rave: 1.Price. Besides I had to use my Xmas certificate from last year before it expired."
5,"""Worth it for the rare songs!""","Even though this album contains familiar songs on 1980's collection CD's like Chris DeBurgh's ""Lady In Red"" and Starship's ""Sara"", it does contain rare ones. One is ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" by Rick Astley. What a voice! Other great rarities are ""Just As I Am"" from Air Supply and ""Never Take Us Apart"" from INXS. Also included on this collaboration is ""I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight"", and who can reject that! The rariest bonus is Sheila E.'s ""A Love Bizarre"", written by Prince and Sheila. Even though this is the single version, it is still worth it. This song is rarely on 1980's collections, while the album it came from, Sheila E.'s ""Romance 1600"" is out of print in the U.S. A reasonable price for rarities. Buy it!"
4,Good 80s but.....,"I thought this was a good compilation album but focuses a little too much on the uptempo songs and not enough of the slow, love ballads, it does contain some songs that rarely appears on 80s compilation albums like Foreigner's ""I Don't Want To Live Without You"", Mr Mister's ""Is It Love"" and Crystal Gayle's ""Making Up For Lost Time"", overall a good compilation album for those who likes good 80s love songs and wants something a little out of the ordinary."
5,Just what I was looking for,Excellent product and delivered fresh. Made of raw milk to keep original flavor. Highly recommended if you like strong taste of raw milk cheeses.
5,Just the best,"Parmigiano Reggiano, mostly grated for use by most of us here in the U.S., is considered very wrong in Italy to use as a ""grating"" cheese. It's used as shavings for toppings to dishes or just for eating chunks. NEVER grated. The best by far is Parmigiano Reggiano Resirva Stravecchio. YUM-O!But I'm here in the U.S., so I do it both ways. Great to eat (wonderful, nutty flavor to me). I use it on pastas, salads, bruschettas. Top off some Artisan toasted bread with pesto and grate this cheese over it, or put a nice shaving on it and set it under the broiler...OMG! It'll make you sass your mama!"
4,Excessive,"[note: this review refers to ""Parmigiano Reggiano -- 90 Pound""]This cheese is very good, but for picnicking, I'd recommend the one pound version of this product. The larger size is unwieldy and overly-filling unless you are picnicking with a friend."
2,It was not what i expected,"I decided to buy a gift for my mother, and I knew she would love this one, but when it arrived in the mail, I did not like it at all, it was too small, and four diamonds were missing, I just feel this was a waist of my money, and time. I have been buying on amazon for months now and everything that I have gotten has been up to my expectation, but this one."
1,I still have not received it.,I ordered this well over two months ago. I still have not received it. If I get it I am sure it will be as outstanding as all of standard deviants products.
4,2 very different concerts....,"2 discs in this live concert recording, which sound like they were taken from a radio broadcast. Disc 1 has Al Bouchard on the drums, circa 1981. This is a sloppy concert, and each song fades out. This is a major annoyance. I expected better.Disc 2 is from a slightly later tour with Rick Downey on the drums. This disc is much better, and has a lot of energy. The recording is very good as well. The 2 disc package is better for the fans, otherwise, buy Part II, sold as a single disc."
2,Missing important details; basic business boilerplate,"This book was a disappointment. I found it to have several chapters of vague generalities and typical small business boilerplate that I don't want to pay for.It definitely does not give me the information I need to know to start a tour operator business. The most important example of it is it simply says nothing whatsoever about insurance and how to protect yourself from liability. That in itself should be an absolute condemnation of the book.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is it says a bit about how to guide a tour, which someone might find slightly useful, but overall, the book is not worth buying."
1,Not very useful,"Absolutely basic approach to tour guiding in this book can hardly give you any valuable knowledge of the profession! Obviously, the authors were unable to give us a more insightful and informative text on tour guiding as such, so they decided to fill their book with some other topics more or less irrelevant to the theme. The second half of the 'Tour Guiding Business' gives us an equally simplified approach to travel agent practice focusing on topics such as 'Making your business legal', 'Equipping your office' and 'Marketing a large tour operation'. Think twice before you decide that you need the book."
4,Wow ! What a great read,"I've read most of Ron Chernows books and they all are just overpowering. The history that you will learn is astounding, and it comes to you as a wonderfully told story. The Warburgs, will put the pieces of the history puzzle together from pre-WWI Germany to the Treaty of Versailles, WWII, post-WWII Germany, plus Warburg involvement with the creation of the current US Central Bank and service on the board of the Federal Reserve. The story covers the split of the family telling the stories of those who remained in Germany some of whom suffered death in the Holocaust, while others lost wealth, position, and sanity yet one remained relatively unscathed building a library of great works while in Germany through Hitler""s reign. The journey of the family is a European, American, and Anglo journey, of a family that prospered and suffered and prospered again leaving it's mark on history for the last three centuries, and still survives."
5,Excellent!,Chernow is so much fun to read. I wish I had history books in school that had this much life and with the perspectives that are portrayed so vividly.
5,Every Bride,"Bought this for my new daughter in law. I got one when I was married and so did my sister, Every bride should have one."
3,ok value,"I guess my expectations are too high for what is described as in excellent condition. The cover was a bit folded, but the inside pages were in excellent condition. Although I would not feel comfortable giving this book as a gift, it was a good buy for my own use."
1,Disappointed at the removal of so many classic dishes.,Mom's (and Grandmother's) recipe for Stewed Rabbit came from the pages of Betty Crocker... and a glance through the index shows no 'Stewed Rabbit'.Others are missing as well. But this is the most glaring example.
1,Great for the beginning cook.,"I bought this book for my son, a beginning cook, and he loves it. Plenty of good advice, well explained...hopefully not too many kitchen disasters!Betty Crocker Cookbook: Everything You Need to Know to Cook Today, 10th Edition"
5,Easy To Use,"I love this book. I have made several recipies from it, and they are easy and tasty!!! Most of the ingredients are not hard to purchase, if you do not have them in your cupboard already. Easy to follow the directions. Great for someone who is starting out or even someone who is experienced, because you can add your own little touches and it still comes out good."
1,Book listed as NEW but missing 75 pages,"Order placed for a NEW book. Book received was not NEW but had a post-it written, ""Damaged - missing pages"". Turns out it was missing 75 pages (one entire chapter). Unhappy with order. Would not recommend purchasing from this vendor."
5,Very pleased,Very pleased with this seller. I received the book in excellent condition and it was actually needed for class the following week and I received it in time for that. Very fast. Thanks!
5,Still the best,"This was a replacement for my older paperback version which was decaying like Egyption papyrus. It is still the best core cookbook for anyone and my children will recieve a copy when they graduate from college, just as my Mother gave me one."
5,A must have,"this book is wonderful, it is a must have! i got one for myself and i love it so much that i told everyone i know about it and they had me order one for them and now whenever i want to give someone a gift i give them this book and they always love it.i live in Belize and sometime they are some things in some cookbook that i cant find but this cookbook, almost everything i need i can always find here."
5,Truely the best,I received this as a present and I spilled coffee all over. I got really upset because the pages got stuck. I bought another one straight away. Can't live without it!
5,"Passing on a""Family Tradition Cooking""","My daughter-in-law requested the ""Betty Crocker"" Cookbook for herbirthday because thatis what I have been cooking with for over 40years of marriage. Her family enjoys the recipes I use from thereand she wants to continue the heritage of great meals."
4,"Another good cook book, easy to follow.","A basic cook book, would be great for someone just learning to cook. No negatives... just nothing special to make it 5 star."
3,Cookbook gift,This is a good basic cook book but there is a bit too much emphasis on prepared items and not enough on the benefits of seasonal cooking.
2,I am the only one here that did not like this cookbook,"I am a cook for many yers. I always swear by Betty Crocker.Well, this book falls in the catagary of only for people who don,t cook."
3,"Betty Crocker Cookbook: Everything You Need to Know to Cook Today, 10th Edition","I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I have a pretty old Betty Crocker paperback cookbook from the 1970's that is well used and falling apart, I decided to replace it with a new book, this newer book leaves out lots of stuff in the older book, (EXAMPLE: a lamb rib roast) so I still can't retire that old paperback and buy more Scotch tape."
5,cookbook,This has been one of my favorite cookbooks for 40 years so when I decided to buy my daughter her first cookbook this was the one.
5,Good book!,"It is a good cookbook I ever had, was surprised it came in really earlier, I love Amazon! :)."
4,Great beginner's cookbook,"I bought this cookbook for my boyfriend, because he asked me for a cookbook to learn to cook with. He has made two things from it; one was okay, the other was great (a Moroccan chicken dish). He found the recipes very easy to follow, and he has fun looking through the book deciding what to try. I am a very experienced cook, and I like the way the book has all the basic information presented, the table of equivalents, measures, that kind of stuff. It has some very good information for beginners in general, too, such as very basic instructions. That being said, having looked at most of the recipes, I don't think that they are that appetizing. Also, it doesn't have the weird information that i enjoy so much when I read my favorite, The Joy of Cooking, such as how to skin and cook a possum or squirrel. Not that those are useful tips to me, they just paint a broader picture of cooking."
5,A Betty Crocker Recipe Never Fails,Gave this as a gift to our neighbor and she absolutely loved it! Uses it nearly everyday and for the last month has made a recipe from any random page and it has not failed her once. Easy and delicious every time no matter what it is! I think I'll buy myself one too!
5,Phils cookbook review,"Betty Crocker Cookbook: Everything You Need to Know to Cook Today, 10th EditionYes, Received this Betty Crocker Cookbook and are thrilled with it. It has a Chapter for everything you should ever need to cook about anything, beautifully written and illustrated and has over 1,000 easy to follow recipes. and a lot o them (130) ready in 20 minutes or less. Has Baking,cakes, pies, cookies, Frying,Dinners, Etc. .. Its the best we have seen for such a reasonable price. Thankyou AmazonSincerely Phillip E. Haddock Pauls Valley, Oklahoma"
2,I'll stick with my dog eared old Betty Crocker cookbook...,"I was disappointed with the scant main dish recipes in this book, not only that, they were kind of 'out there', not what I'd expect from Betty. Granted the ring binder is convenient, I just thought it could have covered a lot more territory. Might be good for a new cook but overall I prefer my old, dog eared copy of the original my Mom gave me when I moved out years ago... I vote pass."
3,"It's a good start, but.....","There's a lot of good beginning cooking knowledge in this book, and for me that's a plus. Coverage of ingredients and techniques is excellent. Many recipes and techniques have photos to accompany them. But I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed in the recipes. I'm not complaining about the quality or taste of the recipes, merely about the quantity.Let's take 2 catagories in the book, Eggs and Chicken, I forget which came first. There are many good recipes for eggs, and for chicken, there are thousands of them out there. Yet we get around 15 for the eggs and maybe 20 for the chicken in this book? Doesn't that seem to few to you?I can't say I'd recommend Betty Crocker as anyone's primary cookbook, but it's a very good introductory cookbook. The recipes are standard American home cooking. It will really help a novice cook."
4,Good for beginners,This is probably one of the best cook books for new home makers (just married) or beginning hobbyist cookers (men or women). It is well written and properly indexed.
3,compared to old cook book,I have a betty crocker cook book from the 1960's. I was thinking that this cook book would have some of the same recipe's but low fat. They did have lots of low fat but I was disappointed to see that my favorites were not in there such as rice pudding and bread pudding. It is a very nice book and well put together.
4,Love it,"What can I say? ..... It's a classic! All the recipes I grew up with, updated for today's cooking style."
4,"This is a great ""go to"" book!",I bought this cookbook a few months ago and use it at least a couple of times a month! There are nice basic recipes for cooking and baking and I love that the nutritional information is listed on the recipes. I also like the different variations listed for many of the recipes. I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone starting out on their own! It makes a great gift!
5,Terrific graduation gift!,"I bought three of these Betty Crocker cookbooks for some of my daughter's special friends who were graduating from high school. I wanted to give them something they could keep forever. They loved it! One girl started trying out recipes that weekend. I had requests from three other girls to get them the cookbook too, so I have purchased three more. Amazon had the best price too!"
3,"Gentle, but not effective","Unlike other all natural deodorants this one did not irritate my skin, but it didn't help the odor once I perspired (even a little sweat)."
1,Long Delay on ATT order,"Ordered the ATT cell plan to replace my existing plan with another carrier. Should have just gone through the carrier store. Took more than a month to receive the plan, the phones etc, and follow up by Amazon was very poor. I had to initiate all calls and emails, and the phone reps were poor in follow up and language deficiency in communication. I would not go through them again for phone plan purchase, at least not until they get act together. Before this, all Amazon purchases were great. This really put a bad mark on their rep with me."
4,its good but bad,"ok,first of all...your not bond..i guess your goldeneye gone bad...the gameplay is ok....not bad but defintely not as good as the goldeneye on nitendo 64..that was a way better game...i would definitely buy the one for nitendo 64...the graphics arent that great either...not as good as i expected..and halo 2 blows this game out of the water as far as the multiplayer,single player and xbox live...its a good buy but i dont think its quite worth the money"
1,Oh my....,"I am an avid video game player, so please take heed to my words if your thinking on purchasing. Even though it is a James Bond game, it absouletly sucks. I ahve probally played every game out there, and this low on the listIt's like they took F.E.A.R. and made it James Bond, and added a little daylight and took away the girl and blood. This game lacked everything a action game needs. Lame, lame, lame."
1,Pathetic,"This new Bond is stupid. You're not even 007 to start with. Also it just does not ring true with the Bond theme to be bad, James Bond is supposed to be the good guy, while in this, the main highlight is shooting innocent people. The pathetic idea of dragging in two ancient Bond villains, who died, to war against each other is so incredibly moronic that it ruins the entire gameplot, reducing it to mindlessly shooting random people. Extremely disappointing, permanently damaging Bond's reputation."
1,"Mirror is fine, suction cups are HORRIBLE","The size of the mirror and magnification are exactly what I expected. However, the suction cups on the back are cheap and flimsy. If you are looking for a mirror with suction cups, don't buy this one."
4,Beautiful voice. Beautiful renditions...,"Thomas Hampson has a wonderful lyric baritone voice and I love the music, so why only four stars? Most of the pieces are a little laid back for my taste. (Maybe the fact that I'm a Mario Lanza fan explains that.) Exceptions are Alleluia, O Holy Night, and Ding Dong Merrily On High. The orchestra plays with wit and taste, which is almost a given when they are conducted by Hugh Wolf. If you love Christmas music sung by a lower male voice, then this album is a must. Does anyone know if Erich Kunz's marvelous carols album is available yet on CD? For anyone who likes Thomas Hampson, Erich Kunz should be tried. His voice is similar to Hampson's voice and his affection for the music shines through. Hampson's vocals are clean and well-focused. This, as one reviewer said, is music for other seasons too."
5,Addicted,"My husband does not think this tastes like real peanut butter, but I like it a lot! I don't remember what the real stuff tastes like, but I eat this stuff by the spoonfuls & it's tasty enough for me!"
2,Lots of soy taste ; far inferior to Wowbutter,"We've tried several brands of soy butter when our daughter was flagged as being sensitive to peanuts. I'd pass on this soy butter in preference for WowbutterWowbutter (2 Pack). The I.M. Healthy has a LOT of soy taste that is unpleasant and unexpected for me, a lifelong peanut butter eater.The Wowbutter flavor profile is just a lot more similar to ""real"" peanute butter and is great for sandwiches. I don't know how the I.M. Healthy and Wowbutter would fare relative to each other when cooking with them."
5,The Best!,"I have loved this specific brand of soynut butter for several years! I'm lucky to be able to buy it through multiple stores. Great choice for those who can't eat peanuts. Actually, who says you must eat peanut butter? No no, choose this soynut butter as your first choice."
4,Great for kids,"My kids, ages 6 and 3 love this product. They prefer it over peanut butter. I gave only 4 stars because I do not like the taste of it."
3,"Not Bad, But WowButter Tastes Better & Better Value","My wife and I are WowButter devotees (a euphemism for addicts). One time, our greatest fear came to pass. WowButter was not available for the great everyday price as an Amazon Prime item. Hence, we gave this I.M. Healthy soy butter a try. Yeah, it was fine. But the jars are smaller than WowButter jars, and the taste was not quite as good. Overall, given the price, we did not think this was worth buying again, once our WowButter was available once again. I would suggest that you buy WowButter instead."
2,Not sooo Happy...,"with all the great reviews I though maybe this would be worth a try...Well, Not so much.If your looking for something that has more of apeanut butter taste spend the extra few dollars on Sunbutter made from sunflower seeds. my Hubby who loves real PB but gave it up after we found out our daughter is allergic to peanuts would not touch this stuff but he really enjoys Sunbutter.It's just not worth the money."
3,Ok- does not taste like peanut butter,"I don't know if other people have forgotten what peanut butter tastes like, but this does not taste anything like peanut butter. This taste exactly like crushed soy nuts, which is exactly what it is. Its not a bad product, it has the same consistency as peanut butter and looks like peanut butter, but tastes like soy nuts. Which, by the way, do not taste like peanuts. (soy nuts are baked soy beans if you aren't aware) It is a fairly strong soy nut taste, you can taste the soy nut taste even with jam. I like soy nuts ok, but I think I will go back to almond butter or peanut butter."
3,Nice kit.,....However I could never tighten lamp enough to keep them from moving around over time. I ended up taking the Lamps off. It's been over 2 years now.
5,Love it,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself and I even wrapped it, so I hope that it goes together as easilie as the others that I have bought"
4,Definitely sensitive,The metal detector is holding up well but it has only had four days of use so we'll see. The startling (and somewhat creepy) testament to its sensitivity is that it beeps next to my ankle (recently fractured and newly supported with titanium rods and screws).
2,any thing there or not,I was disapointed with this item.I bought it at a gift shop in Florida and used it on the beach and found nothing.The only thing I could find were the nails on the steps going up to the hotel.So if your planing too buy a metal detector I would sugjest you buy a real metal detector and not this.
1,Horrible.,"I am so dissapointed with Wild Planet. This is quite possibly the worst item I ever received for Christmas. I did not find anything that wasn't put directly the sensor. After 2 days, I picked it up, and the handle fell off. If you were to ask me, I'd suggest that you never buy this for anyone. Anyone who claims to have found diamonds or rings with this product has to be lying."
2,"No need for facts...just entertainment, please","It is sad that the folks at the University of Michigan chose to publish this tract. Mr. Bourrie's ""facts"" are quite erroneous in several instances. I particularly found his depiction of the Strangite community on Beaver Island to be so completely inaccurate that I had to stop reading the book in order to compose myself. If you just want a pleasant read, without concern for historical accuracy, then this is a fine tome. If you actually expect to come away with a better understanding of the actual history that the author purports to examine...look elsewhere."
5,Fit perfect in a 2000 Chevy Monte Carlo LS,"I received this product in 2 days after I ordered it. This product was excellent, it fit perfectly in my son's 2000 Chevy Monte Carlo LS."
5,Very Handy,"Glad I had this little bit extra replacing the factory stereo in my '95 Buick LeSabre (my model # was XHD6425, not XHD6420 (¿)):Dual XHD6420 4X50 Watt Hd Radio and Mp3/WMA PlayerDual Bluetooth Hands-Free Module - Built-In Mic with Visor Mount"
3,Wrong item!!!,This item came on time and in good condition but did not fit my van 2008 Chevy Express.Had to return it :(Double check befor you buy!!!
1,2004 cavalier Does not work,"I have a 2004 cavalier, with no onstar or satellite radio. The stock end just barely fits in, this adapter isn't big enough to actually be plugged into it. Sort of disapointed. Hope it works for other, but NOT the 2004 Cavalier."
1,BS,"First off, the shipper did not send me a ""Metra"" product. and it was not as advertised. the item i recieved is completely different than the one in the picture."
4,"not what I expected, but not purchased for GM either :). Metra 40-GM10.","This product was purchased to bandaid a dual antenna issue in my Toyota Camry (stock radio has two slots for antenna, aftermarket Headunit has only one, so also bought a Y-splitter 2F to 1M). Although the smaller antenna in my Camry didn't fit all the way in the slot, it made enough of a contact that it helped my reception significantly.I checked the GM smaller antenna connector and it seemed to be as long as my Camry connector, so I am not sure if it would work on the GM models either?! not sure, but giving it 4 stars anyway.I am happy with the purchase and glad I did it."
1,does not work in my vehicle,when I was shopping I used Amazons vehicle fit guide to find the proper parts. This along with three other products I ordered at the time did not fit my vehicle. Very disappointed with Amazons fit guide.
5,Antenna works great.,This antenna is a must for installing aftermarket radios in a gmc truck. Works as advertised with no demished sound or reception quality!
4,Great Product,I ordered this item in the summer as I upgraded my factory stereo in my chevy Tahoe. So far I have had no problems and this item shipped to my APO address fast and with no problems.
5,great review,The review was already left on the other review page. Had to return the item because I ended up not needing it.
1,Did not fit,"This did not fit like the ""bundle"" said it would. Wasnt worth my time to bother returning it. I just really stretched the stock antennae cable."
5,Perfect fit,"97 Saturn Sl2 here with a new JVC stereo. Item came quickly and is a must have! Nice value, too. A+!"
3,have had better had to tape it up to hold it in,anteana falls out easily does not stay connected to unit porperly reception is ok but not greatdoes the job i guess but could be better
3,Works but was not exact fit.....,Item arrived on time. Item stated it would fit for an aftermarket stereo on a 2005 malibu. It didnt. The connections did not fit properly. They would not snap in to place. I placed them together and put some black tape to prevent them from moving on both ends. Antenna still worked. Product can work with a little modification but does not snap into place like it should.
4,Installed in a 2002 Chevy Venture,I installed this is a 2002 Chevy Venture with a friend of mine. The connection does feel a little lose but it wont come unplugged on its own. Just too be on the safe side I used some electrical tape to secure the factory antenna to my new stereo unit.
2,Fit malfunction,"This item was listed for a 2010 Silverado. It does not fit. ""Metra 40-CR10 Chrysler 2002 Antenna Adapter Cable"" fits the Silverado. Anyway, shipping to send it back ate up the refund so it didn't pay me to even send it back."
1,Didn't fit,"Sent the wrong one. Cost more to return than I paid for it. Luckily, the old antenna cable was long enough."
2,Not very tangy at all,"I bought this for a friend who is very sensitive to milky-scented drinks. He had used a Watermelon Protein previously which was very intense in flavor. This orange protein raved about tasting great and fruity, but alas, it was very milky and not pleasant at all. It tasted like a foamy, watered down orange dreamsickle."
2,Ok But Not Great,"I just got this organizer to use in my bathroom. I thought it would be a great spacesaver, but it has some drawbacks. First the good points:1) It has a lot of pockets, good for keeping items separated.2) It's long, makes use of most of the space on your door.3) Canvas hopefully should last longer than vinyl.Now the bad:1) The top pockets do not expand, so can't fit much in them.2) The pockets directly below the ""mirror"" can't hold much weight, if you put in stuff heavier than a compact it will fall out.3) The ""mirror"" is a joke. It's not an actual mirror, it's a piece of cardboard with a shiny mirror-like coating on one side that distorts your reflection and is totally useless for putting on makeup.Bottom line here is, great concept but poor execution."
2,Dishonest tract,"The Schrecks have put together an interesting compendium of information. None of it is original, it is mostly cobbled together from others' ideas. Also they do not name their actual sources. Although they have a long bibliography, their actual sources, e.g. the works of Anton LaVey, Michael Aquino, and the seminal books CARNAL ALCHEMY and LORDS OF THE LEFT-HAND PATH are not mentioned in the bibliogrpahy (although they seem to be the actual background of their work). Why? The book's ok, but the actual sources might be even more interesting."
5,An enthusiastically recommended sky-high feast for the eyes,Napa Valley: A View From Above By Charles Feil And Ernest Rose is a full-color photographic celebration of the renowned wine-making Napa Valley of California. Sweeping aerial views dominate the lavish expanse of this remarkable book; few captions interrupt the majesty of the images themselves. Napa Valley: A View From Above is an enthusiastically recommended sky-high feast for the eyes of Napa Valley's natural and cultivated wonders.
4,One of favorite CDs sounding better and then some!,"I don't know how they equalized the sound, but whoever country did this, my hat's off to them. Not that the original CD release from several years ago is bad. It's not. But this time, the pitches and jangling sounds from Peter Buck's guitar are not screeching or wavering above other important instruments or Michael Stipe's voice. You get to hear incidental effects more clearly this time. Listen to the backup vocals in ""Fall on Me"" and incidentals on ""What If We Give It Away"" just for a taste."
5,excellent pressing,"great music, and very good vinyl copy. good analogue copy. not too expense. provides a more natural reproduction than a MP3 itunes type download from a CD"
5,Loved it so much I replaced it,"I must have loaned this CD to someone. I have all of REM's major releases, many of the hits and b-sides, a few boot legs, etc. I saw REM at a 400 seat venu and a 30,000 seat venu and a few in between.I know this album is a bit over produced considering murmur and reckoning, but I still love this album."
4,Covers It All,"This CD has all the components of late 1970s pop music. Rock, soft pop, and disco are all covered here. A little Fleetwood Mac, Doobie Brothers, Bonnie Tyler, KC and the Sunshine Band, Bay City Rollers. You have to take the good with the bad sometimes, just like we had to in the late 70s. In one were to imagine ads after every three or four songs, this CD would be like real airplay for about an hour or so."
3,Original Hits,"Some rarities are worth looking into, but most of these songs are available on better compilations. And why waste your time with edited versions of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" and ""Feels Like the First Time""?"
3,Too Many Disco Songs,"I felt that they should leave out some of the disco and the soul songs and put more rock songs like Boston's More Than a Feeling, Climax Blues Band's Couldn't Get it Right, Journey's Lovin Touchin Squeezin or Rickie Lee Jones's Chuck E's in Love but they have some good songs like Foreigner's Double Vision (my favorite Foreigner song), The Knack's My Sharona, Hall 'n' Oates's Rich Girl, just to name a few, if you like a wide variety of songs from the 70's, then you'll like this CD but for those who are more into classic rock should go find another CD, I also bought this CD for Bay City Roller's Saturday Night which is a classic song and it became a #1 hit in late 1975."
2,Dressing up dumbing down,"2 1/2Noisy, intense rock can be a wild ride when tuned perfectly but often sounds like much sound and fury signifying very little. Exploiting a quintessential indie-punk rule more effectively than many similar units, COF disguise some shortcomings that arise on the songwriting front with engaging sound-washes of distort, but even that creative aggression ends up feeling like gimmicky filler by the time the disc is done."
3,Comets On Fire. Noise On Fire.,"After reading a short write-up in Spin I decided to check-out the self-titled by Comets On Fire on a whim, and this CD just reeks of frenzied guitar-noise...lots of it. Comets On Fire are very much in the same vein as Japanese noise-rock bands like The Boredoms, Melt Banana, and The Polysics, thrashing garage-rock barrages combined with experimental/spacey noises. Needless to say I've heard this all before, especially bands from the 'Land Of The Rising Sun', but a good comparison would be The MC5 or The Stooges combined with the analog-tweaking of Hawkwind, and a touch of retro 50's psychobilly. Shrieking vocals, energetic guitar-attacks, with vitriolic hyper-kinetic sound. A nice introduction to noise-rock Kamikaze style, yet regardless of where this music comes from...it's all about having a loud, rollicking, good time."
4,"Nice, but stinky","These are a nice size and look wonderful. I understand they are real and would have some smell to them, but the smell was overwhelming when I took them out of the package. I will have to try to air them out somehow before using them in the crafts I planned."
5,Floating away on a cloud of music,"I purchased this CD 5 years ago and now it's worn out. So I ordered a new CD from Amazon(what a great company!!!) I don't know who the orchestra is or who composed this music, but it is spectacular.The strings start out and advance upward and all encompassing, thenpercussion is added and finally a beautiful female voice envelopesthe strings, surrounded by synthesizers. What can I say. I hope heaven is like this. Really exceptional.It really is a ""Mind & Spirit(ual) experience!!!"
3,Adequate but not awesome.,"These were OK... not great... not horrible.I couldn't really tell if they worked or were kind of gimmiky.My heels are pretty darn bad (live in Southern CA and am always barefoot or in sandals in the sand, at the beach, at the pool etc.) so they need BIG help. These just did not seem to be it.I think I may still wear them sometimes, but I still have to be diligent about using moisturizer and using the pumice stone and wearing socks and shoes, that's going to be the only REAL solution.And if I have to still do all THAT, was it really worth getting these?I don't know. Probably not.They get dirty really fast and they didn't come clean really easily.Sleeping with them on was not exactly comfortable.Again, all in all, just OK."
2,Not so good video of a good topic,"This video is interesting, but of a poor quality. The entire series uses the same number of men, and the same costumes that they use for the Greco-Persian wars, and the Pelopponesian wars. It also uses the same commentators, one of whom, has a speech impediment that makes him hard to understand; as well as an historical actor who tends to be melodramatic. Nevertheless, the storyline is clear enough and one can learn as much about the Punic wars as a High School student should know."
1,How manny time i need to do thid,I did this befor . YOU NOT HAPPY WITH THE REVIEW i GAVE ..WELL IT SUCKED i i NEED FOUR WORD. TO BAD!!!!!! ARTHUR.
1,Luciferianism!,A step by step guide in to how to become a devil worshiper!!You will probably become rich too. Is it worth it!!!!!The only book I have actually thrown in the bin!!
3,Interesting but not necessarily true,So many different people and groups claim lineage with the Rosicrucians there is no way to really tell which one's are legitimate and which are not. Although this book may be about the true Rosicrucian Order it doesn't mean the information is accurate. It does contain some interesting information but I think it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. And I have to admit that I got bored with the many pages of tarot explainations that were presented as if they represented the true inner teaching of the Order.
5,1st Flight,"Perfect Choice - I purchased this item for my 4 yr old daughter to use during her first flight. She really enjoyed the player, it is user friendly and just small enough for her to have put in her back pack and carry. She used it in the hotel, on the plane and in the airport as we waited during our lay over."
4,"works fine, is portable and cute","I got this for my son,but I like it. You don't have to look for a battery for this item, it's already built in. I like the small screen when I go work out on the bike, I watch some dvd's and plug in the earphones, as the music in the workout place is kinda cheezy sometimes. I like that it's also a cd player. It's very easy to carry and I've had no problems with it so far. I would recommend this to any mom, although my son complains the screen is small I don't mind it at all. I have a colored tv that small."
3,Good,"It has very good sound and picture, but the speakers look like they are melted. Over all it is a good product, just a little funky looking."
3,NOT THE BEST REGGAETON CD,"I'll admit it. This cd has music that will blow a club down. But that's like only 10 songs out of 40. That's what's cool about this cd. It has 40 songs, but not all of them are tight. If you like reggaeton, go ahead and get this cd. But of you are trying to become a reggaeton fan, get ""the last don."""
4,Goood One,"Este CD estaba buenoComo soy nuevo en esta cosa del reggaetonno se muchopero me ha gustadoEspecialmente el CD No 2es el mejor con Tego, Daddy YankeeIvy Queen, Wisin y Yandely otros mas"
4,Micmac Medicine,This is a great reference for those interested in natural remedies. I highly recommend the supplier.
4,Very handy inflator,Not had to use to jump start my car yet. Bought it mainly for the inflator which works very nicely. This works really well for sports balls and bike tires - which was the main purpose of buying the thing. The pressure gauge is a great touch. Would like to have seen some storage for the adapters and the unit is very noisy. Really notice the noise when inflating car tires and the unit is running for a couple of minutes.
4,B&B Start-It,"Bought mine at WalMart (USA). Came in a box that looked like it had not been opened. However when I arrived at the destination where the starter was necessary, (Mexico), the box was short the pieces necessary to charge the starter as well as the extra inflation devices. WalMart was great and mailed me the missing parts. 48 hours later, after the initial charge, I was back in business. Both clamps are metal and well built.Yea, WalMart and Yea, B&D;."
1,"Great, until failure.","As a tire inflater, it's still good and reliable BUT -and a huge BUT at that - the battery-charger worked only twice then petered out completely. Infuriating. Indicator lights tell me that I'm fully charged but it's a lie. No juice whatsoever. Bummer!"
2,VEC012cbd jump stater,"I have had a few minor issues with this jump starter since it was new,first the recharger quit..after getting a replacement, it gets recharged about once every other month.and is not used often.while I might expect the battery to fail, that has not been the issue.Recently the unit showed no charge despite being recharged, figuring it was the battery, as an electrician,I have worked at a tool maintenance facility, so I opted to replace the battery.after taking the unit apart I was surprised to find the battery fully charged.trouble shooting found the on / off selector switch no longer worked.and two leads to the circuit board had fallen off?over all it looks as if the joints were not soldered on properly if at all..pretty poor quality workmanship.long ago I stopped buying BLACK AND DECKER DUE to QUALITY ISSUES.. THIS JUST RE-AFFIRMS THAT DECISION..given the gentle use this charger had a year is not to long to expect it to work."
