1,A shameful and disgraceful album.,"How any record label could have signed such a mediocre singer as Eddie Santiago is inexplicable- what's just as inexplicable is that this album was so wildly successful. This album literally gave birth to the salsa romantica trend that helped bring salsa to its shameful current state. This album should never have been recorded or released in the first place as Santiago was never a good salsa, bolero or pop ballad singer in the first place. Justo Betancourt, Hector Lavoe, Cheo Feliciano and other 1970s singers truly were salsa soneros (unlike today's wanna-bes)."
5,my daughter loves it,"you who developed it, i salute you, very well made, good components, great ingenuity. my daughter who is 4 enjoys this very much"
3,I am unimpressed,"Bought this shredder thinking it would be better than the last one I bought. Worked well for a while, did a really nice job crosscutting. However, it tends to jam up with the teensy bits of paper, and you have to pull out the wads of shredded paper with pliers. Now, also, something has jammed inside of it, so the auto-off no longer works. So it will run until it is shut off. Also, it can only shred about two or three sheets at once before bogging down. I had high hopes for this and am really just totally unimpressed."
3,Sex Starts In The Kitchen,I didn't care for this book. I have read much better material than this. I was disappointed. Way too much time on birth order and other things.
3,My fault.,"Well, in my eagerness to purchase this particular title by Kevin Lehman to give to some friends who are having some problems, I didn't notice that it is not a CD. It's cassettes. Neither they, nor I, have a tape player any more, so they are basically useless. Memo to me: Read the fine print more carefully the next time!!"
3,Doesn't work,Tried a number of remedies but believe pins may have been damaged. Not enough cost to go through trouble of return etc...
1,Doesn't work with Win 7 64 bit,Doesn't work with Win 7 64 bit. Tried to connect to my old HP Laserjet 6mp and failed.What did work was using a parallel cable to usb adapter. It connects to your existing printer cable.Then to the usb port. Made by CablestoGo.
4,Excellent product,"I bought this product in Feb 2007 to use with HP-4P laser printer. Not exactly plug and play; I still had to load the driver. I also noticed on a few occasions, when a print job is submitted a single lead sheet is printed before the entire print job was printed. Otherwise, a very nice product. It saved me from buying another printer. I reccommend this product."
1,doesn't work with Vista,"Item shipped doesn't quite look like this, maybe that makes a difference.It is not working to connect my older HP Laserjet printer to my new Vista computer. (However, a Kensington docking station works.)"
2,Received Wrong Cable and Returned the Product,"The cable I received was not made by ""Cables Unlimited"" and its size was closer to 4 feet rather than 6 feet as stated in the product information. The cable did not work properly with Windows Vista. Vista recognized and installed the device as well as my HP 4L printer. At that point I was able to print but once the computer was shut down Vista would not restart until the device was removed from the USB port. However, as I stated previously, it was not the cable produced by ""Cables Unlimited"" and I don't know how that product would have performed."
4,Description,"Mary Rose would have loved her job nursing in the large military hospital in Singapore if she had not been so heartsick at suddenly learning her fiance was in love with another girl. Now she wanted only to get away from everything, so when Ninian Macandrew, who had also recently been jilted, asked her to travel to his New Zealand home with him and pose as his fiancee, it seemed the answer to her problems as well as his own.But ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to decieve!"" Warmly welcomed into Ninian's home by his kindly parents, treated as a loved daughter, Mary had to remind herself that it was all based on a lie. And there was no chance that Ninian would turn it into reality, for it was clear that he still loved his former fiancee, who was still, as his bother's wife, very much in the picture."
5,Alice Rules!,"Alice is a highly addictive and amazing game! As Alice, you are drawn into the surreal and visually stunning world of Wonderland. Travel through familiar landscapes, enjoy the haunting music, interact with many of your favorite characters, and fight the hordes of evil creatures set upon Wonderland by the Queen of Hearts. Alice is several years older now, and has been called by her friends, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat, to save their dying world from the Queen of Hearts' rule. Things certainly have changed, and Alice must use an assortment of toys to fight her way past the Queen's minions, solve puzzles, and explore this fascinating world. Truly a remarkable game. While gameplay may seem too simple for such a place, it is still fun and intriguing and worth it just to see the land American McGee has laid out."
5,Short but absolutely engaging,"First, the bad news. Short game (<20 hours for me) and no replay value.Now the good news. The story, the humor, the *total eye candy* in this game was so deeply engaging, it had me riveted to my seat. This was one of the most fun games I've played in a long time. The game play was varied, but definately scripted. In all, hats off to McGee, for ruining my productivity that week."
5,This is a GREAT GAME!!,I have to admit this game is awesome. The graphics and the usage of charactors and so on are the best. The only problem is the fact that you can only play it on your computer. I keep waiting to see if they will make this game for say the PS2 or 3. That would be much much better in my opinion. Having to use the keyboard/mouse for things is a pain but once you get that down your good to go. = )EA Games needs to make this game compatable for play stations tho.
5,Creepy and decadent! Worth the price!,"Definitely one of the creepiest, most imaginative games I have ever seen!! Graphics are peculiar, ever changing demonstrations of the macabre. Not a game that should be viewed by children under about age 12 or 13. The challenges set forth are difficult to master, and of course, the challenge increases with the succession of levels. I did find the limited amount of sounds and grunts that Alice makes a bit annoying, but the amount of intrigue in the play makes up for the mundane noises."
4,Alice,"All of you who complain about the graphics obviously know nothing about PC games, the graphics are a thing of beauty, people complaining about the graphics are idiots. The AI is stupid as when you attack they often run around like chickens with their heads cut off. And the combat can be irritating as many weapons are slow and or ineffective. The game is fun nontheless."
4,Killer,This is a great game. I think the graphics are so-so; polygons are pretty obvious. I expect better graphics in a PC game--the graphics in Alice are equivalent to those found in most N64 games. The psychadelic atmospheres are unbelievable. It is an amazing game. The artificial intelligence is decent. The fact that I cannot use a keypad or joystick with this game is annoying. The keyboard/mouse commands are confusing until you get used to them. Aside from the cons--the fact of the matter is that Alice is FUN--FUN FACTOR = 9 out of 10.
3,Beautiful but annoying,"The character and landscape models and textures are beautiful, no doubt. But the AI is often brainless, the character movement is awkward and sometimes gets stuck, the character animations are avg to stiff, visual glitches are more common than they should be, and overall gameplay is just disappointing. Looks like another product was rushed out the door for those infamous Christmas sales figures, and quality be damned.If you're expecting what the Alice theme implies.. clever puzzles, witty prose, novel adventures, and so forth... look elsewhere. The *idea* of this game is excellent, as is the artwork, but the gameplay is no better than a pointless B-grade 3rd person shooter.Disappointing, because I really had such high hopes for this game."
4,A good game w/ great graphics,"I have to say that I am judjing this game from the demo. This game has some of the best graphis that I have ever seen. The fire looks great and the swaying clocks look extremely real. One thing I just have to bring up is that I do not think that it is all that viloent, and it recieved a ""m"". Another wierd thing its that whenever you kill a card it always gets cut in the same place, no matter where you attack it. I is also cheap how when your your enemies die they shrink and dissapare. The sound is great and the music is scary. Overall it is a good game."
5,AN EARIE NONSTOP NIGHTMARE!...,"THIS GAME RULES!... It's not too hard. It's not too easy. The enemies are really freaky! The story is great! The scenery is probably the best part. With all of the floating platforms, castles, and portals & stuff! The music is really creepy. I'd give this 6 stars if I could! I wouldn't excaclty recommend this to fans of ""Alice in Wonderland"" though and I don't think I need to give you a reason why. (If you like this game, I'd highly recommend ""Clive Barker's Undying"". It's not as good as this, but it's still very creepy and well pieced together.)"
3,Beautifully boring,"Definitely one of the most visually astounding games I've ever seen. The graphics designers on this one really had their act together. But the game/play designers were rather uninspired.The most complicated puzzles amount to jumping puzzles (probably the most annoying type of puzzle ever created, thank you Nintendo). Every level has at least one jumping based puzzle (luckily the ice board is mercifully short).If this game is on sale I would recommend it just for the visual pleasure of it. The drive to see what's around the corner is often enough to keep you moving. It is a highly imaginitve game, with numerous tidbits of humor. For instance, if you let Alice stand still for a while, she has a different set of ""waiting"" animations for each weapon (some are pretty funny).However, if you're looking for a fast paced shooter, get Half-life: Counterstrike and go online."
2,American McGee's Alice,"I didn't find that American McGee's Alice lived up to all it seemed to be on the box cover. The character is hard to control, the clues are very vague, and the gameplay can be really slow, even interrupted if there is too much action on the screen at once. I'd spend my gaming dollars somewhere else..."
2,Could've been better,"This game has great graphics, but it's too hard to play. The jumping forward is hard to control. And just a few levels into the game the enemies strength becomes overpowering and in many cases they are impossible to beat and I can't win the level. I was resorted to use the cheats to make it through. And to add to that, starting a new level can take five minutes to load. The only thing I enjoyed about this game are the great scenic environments and well drawn graphics. Overall I give this game a thumbs down."
2,Could've been better,"This game has great graphics, but it's too hard to play. The jumping forward is hard to control and I keep falling into the pits. And just a few levels into the game the enemies strength becomes overpowering and in many cases they are impossible to beat and I can't win the level. I was resorted to use the cheats to make it through. And to add to that, starting a new level can take five minutes to load. The only thing I enjoyed about this game are the great scenic environments and well drawn graphics. Overall I give this game a thumbs down."
2,Like Super Mario Bros on a bad acid trip,"Beautiful graphics wasted on what is fundamentally a Nintendo game from the early 90's: all you do is run, jump, get power-ups, kill monsters. I appreciated the concept, the insanity and twisted dark world these folks (EA) have created, but their talent would have been better applied to a less linear, more intelligent gameplay design."
2,Unlimited potential...,"...unrealized. Excellent idea, excellent graphics, completely destroyed by endless physical puzzles unrelated to the game itself. Could have been fantastic, ended up frustrating. **"
2,Just Ok...,"The only thing I liked about this game was the graphics. They were great, and the only reason that I wanted to keep playing."
2,2 for graphics,"When I first heard of this game, I was looking forward to it. By the time I had played it, I was really disappointed. The AI is horrible, and there are glitches all over. There's not much else to the game but the graphics... probably the best use of the Q3 engine yet, but graphics can't carry a game. American McGee should have stuck with level design, he's obviously way over his head here."
1,DEFECTED?,It might be a fun game if Alice's stats were not in the center of the screen. I have tried everything to fix this: from completely changing the resolution to messing with every last option in the game. I guess I'll just have to wait to see the movie instead.
5,Just Awesome,"I think American McGee's Alice is one of my all time favorite games. It has lush, dark, beautifully rendered settings. It has interesting and graphically compelling characters and a good backstory. Granted it is not for the kiddies but that this is made for us older gamers is just another plus in my book. I was drawn into Alice's world within minutes of starting play. If you have played Clive Barker's Undying and enjoyed that then you will probably love Alice. It edges out Undying a bit in my book in areas of ease of game play and coolness of weoponery but it is atmospherically similar. In terms of comments on difficulties with movement I have yet to find a game that didn't have places where the movement was tricky or unpredictable. I didn't notice any really bad or overly annoying problems in Alice myself."
2,errr....DOESNT SUPPORT NT or 2000????,"ok now, if they want me to play this game make it for 2000 alright because me/98 just plain ol' sucks and if you dont have 2000 you should get it. So someone tell EA to make alice for 2000."
2,Through the Looking Glass,"When I saw the trailer for this game I thought it looked sweet, but soon however after I bought it I realized that this game does alot of injustice to the entire concept behind the book that Alice was based on.This is a kids game with a mature rating any adult i would hope would understand that Through the Looking Glass was a antiwar,antiviolence satire.The entire reason Alice went to wonderland had been to escape war torn England.Other than that it has some of the worst gameplay and control factors ive ever seen.I wanted to like this One,but couldnt."
1,My God! These reviews are six years old,This game pretty much sucks. It is an old game that makes you start at the begining of a scene each time you are killed. You have to sit thru all the same stuff too many times. Bought this cause it was cheap. Not worth it.
5,Visually Stunning,"Electronic Art's new game Alice is a visually stunning masterpiece complete with beautiful graphics and sweet gameplay. Your character is Alice from the Wonderland books who is now older and a touch on the psychotic side. Unlike the older adventure games that come before this like Alone in the Dark and Tomb Raider, Alice is more artistic. Also on the downside it is highly more violent. Though it is definitely a game to be kept away from younger children, it is spectacular enough so that it can not be ignored."
4,Very interesting,"While I enjoyed the plot, the graphics, as well as the music; I found that the way the camera movement was set up was very uncomfortable. It followed Alice way to quickly and caused a slight case of dizzyness. If homemade videos where the camera man is a little unstable dont bother you, go for it! I truely wish I could have finished the game if not for that fact."
4,Great Game!,"Good Points:The graphics are astounding. The Sound is equally impressive. GamePlay is perfect. There are many individual (And very unique) characters you interact with, and each of them have a very well defined personality. The game, overall, is very well thougth out and makes too much sense.Bad Points:Nothing but a few trivial nuisances. When you enter into a new level and it autosaves it will pause up during some heavy disk access times. -This could just be my computer (Probably is)."
4,Well done but tiresome game,"This game is designed for people who like to slice and dice their way through to the end. It is bloody and twisted. If that is the type of game you like then what are you waiting for? However, if you like games that have more of a plot to them (or any plot) and try to appeal to your intellect even a little then avoid this one. I'm not saying the game is bad. It's not. In fact, technically, it's superb. But if you don't go for this type of game then you will be disappointed. Also, the hardware requirements are rather steep. Mega amounts of RAM, a special high end video card and over 500MB of hard disk space are required."
3,Entertaining fun with Affleck as a angst-ridden senior.,"This film won't win any awards and some people will find it's humor to be crude, but if you are a true Ben Affleck fan, you will appreciate his low-key performance as the leading man in Glory Daze. It's a great film to put on late at night when you can't sleep. Ben looks great in his graduation robe and NO shirt. The bus scene is funny - see if you can recognize the annoying couple that ""Jack"" talks to on the #3 bus. The soundtrack is great, if you can find it. It made me a NOFX fan and I also go around singing ""Acetone"". I have seen parallels between this movie and GWH. It made me wonder if Ben wrote similiar scenes on purpose. This movie gives you some great quote lines that no one else will understand unless they've seen Glory Daze. ""as for me, my name is Jack - happy go f***ing lucky as the day I was born"" ! Rent or just buy Glory Daze!!!!!"
2,Glory Days?,"This movie is pretty interesting. Ben Affleck as a college student is a stretch, considering he tried to go to college in real life. This movie does not really go into glory days of college, but a look at four guys future after college. Pretty lame."
2,MTV Shallow,"Slick like a MTV video, rap pulsating in the background, punkypost-grunge set and clothing, Glory Daze amuses, but it's shallow,clichéd amusement. The senior year at college winds down and all the stereo-types jam a run down student's house. The beer flows, the girls hang around for what reason I don't know (duh), and the furniture is smashed. Cool huh? OK, my senior year wasn't much different back in 69, just more drugs, but what did we learn? For most kids, we didn't learn awhole lot. That's why it's tough to make immature personalities come alive in film. It takes a real artist, but what the hell, last chance to make a fool of yourself without consequence, usually."
3,Missing the only hit,"This is a great collection - (five stars for the complete CD) but be aware that it's missing a track - on the CD, track two is Barbara George's ""I Know (You Don't Love Me No More),"" but it has been omitted from the MP3 version. Considering that it's really the only widely known 'hit' on the album this is a serious omission."
1,Cheers and Jeers,"Cheers to Simple Green for being effective and easy to use. But jeers to Amazon for selling a spray bottle of this stuff for three times the price that can be found at Home Depot. When I saw $15 for a spray bottle of Simple Green, I knew I had not paid that much for my previous bottle. I was going to order it here but decided that the price seemed a bit outrageous. So I made a quick trip to Home Depot and found it for under 5 bucks."
5,Great Product,"This set is super. I've had the little fold out couch thingys and this one is by far the better buy. I have two little boys who don't like to share most of the time so they each have their own little chair. The third piece can also act as another seat or can be used as an ottoman. My boys like to put the seats on both ends of the ottoman and lay down inside; much more cushiony than the couch thingys. I love how the ottoman stores nicely inside the seats also. We've had this set for about three years now and it still looks absolutely great. Just like new. I've washed the cover a couple of times and there is barely any fading at all. Overall, love it. Makes a great gift also."
4,Solar Systwm Coloring Book,"Very nice book Since my Grandson will be getting a telescope for ChristmasI think its the perfect little ""extra"" that he will enjoy"
3,"Slow, difficult, has glitches... but the courses are great.","I have played Tiger Woods 99 and enjoyed it very much. I cannot say the same for this version. The game play is slow and there are several minor glitches. No single glitch is very bad, but when you add up all the small glitches together, it gets quite annoying.In addition, this game is quite difficult, especially compared with Tiger Woods 99. I was able to shoot below par pretty often on the pro setting with Tiger Woods 99, but now I average 8-10 strokes over par on Tiger Woods 2001.The main reason I bought this game was for the new courses, and they are great. With the older version, playing only three courses got boring after a while. This version has many more to choose from, which is a huge improvement. And as always, the computers courses are very close to the real ones. Playing many of these courses in real life is very expensive, so Tiger Woods golf is a nice alternative."
2,Stick with Tiger Woods 99 or 2000,"Using a 466 with 128 ram, this game puts one to sleep between shots. I loved the '99 version, but was extremely disappointed when I saw how slow play was on the 2001.I also found many of the graphics to be too dark on certain holes and courses."
1,Awful at best . . .,"The flinstones of golf games , PGA Tour 2001 continues to garner support from reviewers ?? I'm amazed by how truly primitive this game is after spending time with Microsofts Links series . PGA Tour 2001 has pathetic graphics , horrible ball physics and audio . . . I can't really think of one redeeming quality except that it uninstalls easily to let me get back to playing Links 2001 ."
1,How Stupid,"I waited months for ""TW 2001"" to hit the shelves, but was very disappointed. As an owner and player of ""TW 1999"" I couldn't wait to get 2001. You see, I went out and bought a new Dell system with all the bells & whistles with Windows ME hoping to have the greatest PC golf experience ever. Well, much to my suprise EA Sports has created Tiger Woods 2001 but it does not support Windows 2000 or ME. I mean, this new ""OS"" has only been out for close to a year now. STUPID STUPID STUPID"
2,Not what I had hoped it to be,"I have multi Andre Rieu DVD's and had expected this one to be just as great, but it was not. This DVD plucks bits from previous DVD's, copies them onto this one and with that routine; dimmness, blurry immages, and the introduction to each presentation from Andre himself are skipped.He himself brings laughter, humor, and appreciation to the people who wrote these classic songs.Anyway, I will not load this one into my DVD player again. I am donating this one to a nursing home due only to the fact that they have not seen the superior ones that I have.I do take my DVD's of music to nursing homes, no one forgets music!"
5,Must Have Component for any Electronics,"No matter what project I undertake, before it is over I end up using a 7805 regulator. The 7805 takes a voltage between 8 and 30 volts and regulates it down to a steady five volts. For best performance you will want to put capacitors between pin one and ground, and between pin 3 and ground. With the black part facing you, the left pin (pin one) is the input, and the right pin (pin three) is the output. The center pin is the ground. These are very easy to hook up.These regulators will handle a fair amount of current, but they do get hot. If you are really driving larger currents, consider hooking these to a heat sink."
5,it works!,it does what its supposed to do....was properly packaged...... purchased it for a 555 timer charge controller as a final year eeet project
5,"Canadian Humour, Eh??","If you love plays on words, and just plain craziness from the male perspective, you will not be able to stop laughing at the whole series of Red Green tapes. They are ALL funny (I know, I bought them for my husband, who idolizes this guy and his Mr. Fix It approach) and you will have many, many hours of enjoyment. A lot of these you have to watch over and over again just to get all the humour. They are great!!"
1,ho hum,"Would this book have been made had the project been done by someone other than Mary Ruefle? I have to wonder as I know that this little ""gem"" owes as much to William ""cut-up"" Burroughs as to Tom Phillips and in both cases, their earlier work is superior to this offering.This is supposed to be an old book that has been altered into a single poem, but it feels as glossy as anything being presented by any number of print-on-demand outfits. It doesn't feel old nor smell old nor look old. And I daresay that there are dozens of other book alterer out there who have done this project many times over and probably better than this, but their name isn't Mary Ruefle and that's the reason their project wasn't published by Wave.this could be an e-book for all it's worth. blahunimpressed"
2,not good,For some reason I had a hard time cutting metal stud and track with it. The long nose is great but useless if you can't make any cuts with it.
1,Very Disapointed,"The biggest pice of junk ever purchaced. The guitar needed to be retuned daily, and then the the screws for the string mounting bracked pulled out. Very poorly constructed. Guitar broke after 1 week."
3,Useful but lacking opinions,"I have used many Lonely Planet Guides and they are all useful. This one is also useful, but unfortunately tends to present facts only. The other books have plenty of opinions which are so valuable. LP Philippines doesn't have many of these and it is difficult to pick the ""best"" places. It also lacks info on the ""darker"" side of the Philippines, especially Manila and I feel it needs more on travel safety and security - without being paraniod."
3,"Good guide, but out-of-date","As always, Lonely Planet provides excellent and thorough travel information and travel tips. But all such information is extremely time-sensitive. With this guide published in 1997, which contains advice dating back to 1996 or so, we are far out of date ! Advice is great and complete, but much of it is out-dated. The Philippines have changed a lot in the last four years. Prices quoted in the guide make no sense any more. Historical and political information also need a great deal of revision. All in all, on this occasion you may be better off getting one of the other guides (until - of course - LP publish a newer edition of this one)."
2,update details on Legaspi City,"The biggest and most beautiful hotel in Legaspi City, Albay which is Mayon International Hotel is not included in your 7th edition. Your data about this city is very much outdated. Lots of hotels written in the book have shut down. Do another research."
4,just travel........,lotsa interesting places jens has visited........even met some of the people that contributed info. on far off treks.....i think a guide book would be a great help to new travellers.!..
4,"Tyrone, the Horrible","The story describes how Boland, a little dinosaur, experienced a series of bullies by a big kid dinosaur, Tyrone. The story is very helpful to show young children how bullying events can happen to them. At the same time, it offers mnoral support to children who may be going through similar encounters. The ending was dramatic and in my opinion, somewhat disappointing. I worry children being bullied may follow a similar path and try to ""resolve"" the bully in the same fashion. With adult guidance, the book can potentially be a good vehicle helping children starting to talk about bullying."
1,Advanced?,"I was looking for a book on advanced techniques - this is NOT the book. She covers roller hockey, speed skating and other topics very briefly. The book is misnamed...........should read ""In Line skating Activities""....."
1,Don't bother,"Advanced? Are you kidding? This book spends a lot of time about covering a broad range of topics - but none in depth. I was looking for a good book on techniques -- well this is NOT the one. It is very superfiscial and not worth buying. I found some ""beginners"" books with more info!"
5,A Powerful Gem - Will Change How You Write Forever,"You know, I was worried at first. I picked up this book, knowing the time it was written and what the language is generally like. For example, I have trouble reading some other classics (like, everything written by David Ogilvy). so I was concerned this would be some ""stuffy"" turn of the century English book.I was DEAD wrong.Collier's skill at writing shines through. Not only does he verbally teach you to write... but in his own writing methodology he exemplifies it.In layman's terms: he practices what he preaches.I really enjoyed this book. Collier has great stories and very powerful ads. He doesn't just say, ""This is a good idea, try it."" He takes you by the hand, shows you what was done, how it was done, why it was done, and how to do it again.Incredible book. Highlighted, dog eared, and to be read again and again for days to come.By the way, this book is much bigger than I expected. It's a heavy, information stuffed masterpiece."
3,Get to the point!,"You can tell Robert Collier has the idea, but you'd be better served to read something by Clayton Makepeace or Gary Bencivenga, or even Victor Schwab or Dick Sanders.Collier is too wordy. Better old school copywriters with great books are, of course, David Ogilvy, John Caples, and Claude Hopkins."
5,A sweet story my toddler loves!,"A charming look at a day in the life of a busy toddler, from waking to bedtime with many adventures in between. My two year old loves the rhyming and the sweet illustrations. A great bedtime story, too."
1,Disappointing and Useless,"This entire video is sung with lyrics and subjects for children visiting a zoo. Unless you plan to spend an entire visit in Italy at the zoo, this video is useless. P.S. The melodies are boring and the lyrics forgettable in any language."
4,Almost too realistic,"One of the main things soldiers do in the army is drill. My stepfather tells me stories of how, when he was in Germany, all he did was drive around a colonel and play cards.Enter 688(i) Hunter/Killer, where most of your time is filled by plotting courses, reading manuals, and attempting to pass undetected in open waters. While this is very realistic, it isn't the most exciting game in the world.Fortunately, 688(i) comes with a ""create your own scenario"" mode, where you can populate the ocean with cruise ships, fishing boats, and other attack subs to fill with torpedos.This is an enjoyable game for those who have the time and patience to learn the game."
4,...a balanced compromise,"while Fleet Command is just a real-time ""no brain"" tactical air-naval warfare, 688 seems to be a more realistic and exciting sub simulator; (actually, I never played F/A-18, so I will not rate it).So, despite it's not a ""state of art"" project, the overall pack is a valuable and balanced mixup of action and concrete involvement,in which the ""baby"" Fleet Command is effectively pretected by ""the great"" 688!"
2,688iproblem,"I bought the Naval Collection to use the submarine portion. When I installed the game it worked fine and then I tried to find an instruction booklet on how the game works.....and there was none! The F-18 game has a guide book of over 100 pages on how to fly the thing and what you're mission is. The 688i game is quite involved and if you have no guide book just to get you going, it is next to impossible to play. I went to get another game, but in it, there was again no game book. I really want to play this game, but need at least some kind of directions to at least get me started....there is nothing!All I want is a little guidance to tell me what the heck I'm supposed to be doing.I would like to hear from others to see if maybe I'm doing something wrong and the guide book is somehow in the game itself in the help area or something. This game seems to have great potenial, but should come with at least some type of instrucions...especially on how to maneuver the boat."
3,good but not great,This game is ok if your good with keyboard controls. I on one hand had a lot of trouble with F/A 18 688 (i) both those games are flight and submarine sims and there cool but not great. Fleet Command is the third game in the collection and it is fantastic.In fleet command I really enjoyed controling Navy forces. I really think if you enjoy Simulators you'll love this collection of games.
4,"Good Single, OK Bonuses...","Drowning Pool's 2001 debut ""Sinner"" has presented three singles, this being it's third...and sadly, last. ""Tear Away"" is a mellower song from an otherwise heavy band, but it's also the second best. Anyway, here's how I rate the songs...1. Tear Away-5/5-As I said before, one of DP's best songs.2. The Game-5/5-This song is also avaible on the ""WWF Forceable Entry"" soundtrack. On the soundtrack, it's the best song, so it's awesome here, too. Very fast, loud, and heavy. Everything you need.3. Break You-0/5-Also avaible on the Scorpion King soundtrack. It's not good at all. Very slow, quiet, and boring. Nothing you need...well, maybe, but this just is bad.4. Tear Away (Video)-2/5-This isn't the best video in the world, and not Drowning Pool's best, either. Another thing that gives this single a 4.That's my review, now click the ""helpful"" botton...P.S.:RIP Dave Williams"
2,Great for indepth understanding and analysis but hard to read,I purchased this Book for a calls I am taking for a Doctor of Ministries program. For that kind of study or for a Pastor/Teacher that is looking for well researched indepth information and analysis this Book is one of the very best. If you are looking for an easy read this is not the Book. This is a commentary and as such has lots of Hebrew and technical terms. If you do read it take your time and look uo the footnotes and cross references
4,Portraiture with Mary Whyte,"I learnt a lot from this DVD. Mary is a good teacher and explains everything she does and more, unlike some artists's tutorials I have seen. I am definitely inspired to attempt more portraiture now. I love her painting style, and can recommend this DVD. My only wish is that it was twice the length, with a second portrait demonstration!"
1,STAY AWAY,"Only after ordering, is it apparent that weighted bases are not included. So the set is completely useless. While the manufacturer should of course include them as part of a ""set"", the images and description on this site are very misleading."
4,Great set when used with the multi domes,"As a Physical Education teacher I have built quite an extensive set of multi dome products.These nets are great 10 foot nets I use for pickleball, throwing and kicking over, as well as pathways in obstacle courses.The domes are 14.00 each so the actual tennis set cost is about 50.oo for the complete set. The set is pretty stable when filled with sand. I will continue to build my multi dome set and hope that the company continues to create new products.Expensive but good quality!"
4,Glyn's book has brought us back together.,"Glyn and I are first cousins, and therefore, several of his characters have our family names. We had not visted or written each other in many years. Upon finding out about his book from his sister, and purchasing it a few weeks ago, we have been e-mailing each other almost daily. I discovered that his style of writing is unique, and can not be compared with John Grisham's. Glyn's book is not just in a courtroom setting, which can tend to get complicated and boring for the average reader. His having so much knowlege in many fields keeps you thinking, and guessing what next!! I am very proud of my kinfolk, and am looking forward to reading his next novel."
1,A Christmas Let Down,"I was really looking forward to this game. When I started playing I was upset with the graphics and the controls. For all the hype you would think the graphics would be a bit better. When you have to move around the screen, it's a lot of right click, left click, but only if the mouse is in the right spot to have the right symbol show up. It is hard to explain, until you see it. So since Christmas day, my game has been in it's box not being played. If you really want this game, go see a friend who has it first."
3,"ok, but bugged up",i got this game thinking it looked cool. when i got it home i put it on a really bad computer because noone uses it and it would be free more often. well it couldn't even take the graphics in the install program so i moved it to another computer. i got it running but it would go to a blank black screen all the time making me restart the computer. i say it is a good game but dont get it unless you have a very nice computer
3,Fun Advanced Frustration,"This is a really interesting and deep game that is crippled by a few minor issues. Managing the villagers really sucks. I was going to download the soccer add-on for when they have no desires, but quickly realized that they ALWAYS want something. It's impossible to keep them happy all of the time. Secondly, the gesture system for miracles is a major pain. It seems that whenever you need to cast a miracle in a hurry (water, lightning, heal, etc), you're apt to make the wrong gesture and end up with a useless miracle like teleport. The developers should have enabled keyboard shortcuts for miracles - at least while fighting another creature.The creature is obviously the best part of the game. It's pretty neat when you see this skinny little know-nothing chimp grow into a godzilla-sized avatar doing the macarena to impress villagers."
2,"Slow, Short, and Tedious","This is the most over rated game ever. It has a great idea, but the story line is horrible (there barely is one), the controls are awkward, the gameplay is boring, and the game is extremly short. The only reason I gave this game 2 stars is because the graphics are amazing, but thats about the extent of the good in this game."
2,Your villagers need a patch,Do not buy this game until you find out that there is a working patch that actually allows you to finish the game.
1,Don't bother,"This game looked cool. This game had fairly good reviews. But...I hated having to micromanage every little detail. I found the controls confusing and buggy- I was unable to attach my creature's leash to anything at all, for example. The tutorial was lacking in much basic information, and I couldn't find where to learn this stuff. I was thrown into a game with my villagers whining about needing food, housing, mercy (whatever!) etc, and I didn't know how to help the little jerks. Plus, the biggest drawback was how you navigate around the world. I guess I have a bad sense of direction, because I couldn't find anything. And all the swooping and twirling gave me motion sickness- honestly! I tried sitting down to read after playing, and almost got sick!Try something else."
1,A lot of work for a little entertainment.,"The game has a very interesting concept and the graphics are excellent. However, the UI is very difficult to use and requires a lot of practice to get used to it. Furthermore, from my little bit of playing the game the emphasis seems to be more on developing your creature than anything else. I have to admit having to keep an ever vigilant eye on the creature kind of irritated me and took away from the overall game experience. All and all I was not as impressed with the game play as I was with the concept and quickly grew tired of this game."
3,prepare for maximum fustration,"Cool idea, but the creatures and villagers have sniffed too much glue or someting-they are completely idiotic. And the gameplay itself is slllooowwww and choppy, which negates any movements you are attempting to make and makes casting spells impossible. I can't even begin to descibe the feeling when ""god"" tries to zoom in on a specific locale to complete a lame and boring task, only to have the efforts totally ruined by the chopiness. Now that I think about it, why did I give it a 3? Oh yeah, I meant negative three--that's way more accurate. A complete and utter waste of time and money. Spare yourself--trust me on this one."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Yes, the graphics are good. Yes, the AI is amazing. But no, the game is not worth the money. Why? Because the game is filled with bugs of varying degrees of severity. Some mearly slow game time down, causing you to repeat things in order to make them work. Others are disabling, such as the ""creature curse bug,"" and cause gameplay to stop altogether.I can see how this was ""a labor of love,"" as it is a very ambitious product. However, like many ambitious goals, this game falls far short of its ideal.These bugs would not be as much of a problem if the manufacturers were more supportive of their customers. At this date, more than two months after release, there are no downloadable patches to fix ANY of these bugs, even the major ones. Also, several items described in the users manual are not present yet... no, your villiagers cannot play soccer, despite what the box says. Miracle dispensers do not yet work...I could go on and on, but the basic message is this:Buyer Beware"
1,after a week or 2 its boring,I write a 5 star review of this game a long time ago but that was a couple days after I got it I decided to edit it to say after 2 weeks I HATED THIS GAME it just got repetitive and boring. evreything just seems like chores.
4,Windows XP Pro,I haven't played this game yet but my kids sure like it. I just installed xp pro and had to reinstall Black & White. Well it wouldn't work and I thought that was gonna be it. So just for the hell of it I tried to run it under windows 2000 compatibility mode (instead of 98/ME) and it works great.Right click on the game then choose properties. Choose compatibility tab then check the run in compatibility mode box then choose windows 2000. Finally check the run in 640x480 box.The setup book said 16 bit color so I have that set in my display properties. Right click the screen the choose properties. Good Luck.
1,Frustrating and Monotonous,"This game has many serious flaws which ultimately make it unplayable. What it comes down to is that the villagers are too stupid to take care of themselves, which makes it impossible to create a self-sustaining village. Therefore you have to spend enourmous amounts of time telling the villagers to do basic things like chop down trees, harvest grain, and reproduce. That's right. They won't reproduce unless you tell them to, which means that you must constantly match boys and girls together to keep the village from dying out. This distracts you from doing fun and interesting things, like training your creature to seek out and destroy the enemy. After 50+ hours playing this game and still feeling like I was getting nowhere, I gave up in frustration."
1,a huge disappointment,"this could have been a really excellent game. it was so full of bugs though, it was unbearable. not only does it take 5 minutes to start up, but then it freezes all the time! and now when i try to load my games, the game starts over at the beginning. the customer support was awful as well."
2,"Great start, fizzles quickly","At first glance, Blacka and White looks like the everything-killer. The graphics and sound will crash your jaw through the floor. Creature interaction is wonderfully entertaining and challenging. The story is good and the interface is ingenious.Unfortunately, this all wears off after about 3 hours. You will soon discover that the game simply isn't fun. You are forced to manage your whiny villagers endlessly and unless you train your creature just right, you will be picking up after it's obnoxious little self for the majority of the time.All in all; a great start trips on it's own AI-encoded toe and falls crashing to the ground"
3,"It's good, then again, it really isn't.","This game has many things other games don't have. Great graphics, very good AI, and pretty interesting, new type of gameplay. But(There is always a but)the game gets a little frustrating, and to complex for some(If this is you, don't worry, cuz it is me too). When you are trying to do one thing, something else happens, and then when you try to handle that, something else always happens, and it just keeps happening! Don't get me wrong, I think the game is good, but don't buy it unless you really want to try something new, and can control many things. Otherwise, just buy a fun FPS :)"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Overhyped, underdeveloped. Shrot linear plot/storyline where fluid was promised, terrible amounts of micromanagement, AI on the creatures is not adaptive, just rote canned ""behaviors"" that you can enable or disable.Save your pennies kids, there's MUCH better out there."
3,Warning on system requirements,"This is not so much a review, but simply information that I am suppying to those who may need it. I played this game a few years ago, and I liked it, although I didn't love it. Since then, I have gotten a new computer, which is a Dell with Windows XP. I decided I wanted to play again today, but found that I couldn't run the game. You must have your color palette set to 256 colors in order to run this game. In new computers like mine, you are not even given this option. To find out if this is a problem for you, go to the ""Display"" area of your ""My Computer"" file. Click on the ""Settings"" tab. If you are able to put your settings to 256 colors, you will see the option right there. If you can't find it anywhere, you are in the same boat as me, which means that your computer is too advanced to run this game."
1,Good luck getting it to work,"This game was a huge disappointment. I have no idea what it's like to play because at about 10 minutes into it, everything froze and it had to be reinstalled. The patches were no help. You'd think for the price, the designers would have made sure all of the bugs were worked out. I'll never buy another game designed by this company.What a shame...it could have been fun."
1,"Simulation, not fun","There is no gameplay. Also the bugs make it nearly unplayable. It would be a nice simulation, except that it really doesn't do anything after a few minutes.Zero stars for this one, sorry."
3,ok,"this game was pretty good, although i guess it would be better if i hadn't lost the disc before i really had time to play it enough to get my creature and town going... oh well"
2,The Big Disapointment,"Firstly i wanna say that,when i saw this game,i was really shocked.I hoped i can see a fascinating game because most of the magazines sad ""This game is the best game of this year"".But i can only say that,this game gets a big disapointment."
1,"A terrible game, stay away","Like many others, I bought into the hype when this game was released and bought it at full price. Easily the worst gaming-related purchase I have made. Endless micro-management of your worshipers, clunky and awkward controls, and boring missions and objectives. Stay far away from this waste of money and time."
5,An excellent game,Black & White is a great game. You must have a fast pc and a good video card to take advantage of the game. Everyone that says that the graphics suck are wrong. Its your pc that sucks.
1,Just call this game bug,"Dont buy this game if you have a 3dfx voodoo banshee video card the only good graphics are on the creatures,the support is also terrible i called a few days ago and the support person said go to the site and download the patch, after waiting the agonising 45 minute download i tryed to run the patch and then it said""cant patch this you do not have the right version installed"" How many versions are there???? two Words DONT BUY IT!!! Lion head studios is geting NO more buisness from me!!!"
1,If you have XP or XP pro don't get this!!!!!,This game wont work with XP nor XP pro no matter what you do to your settings as suggested on the games website for XP users. There is no way to get this game to work. It'll start up with the title screen then boot you back to the desktop screne. I wish the makers of this game would make a patch for this game to work on XP and XP pro. If they ever do then try buying this game. Otherwise your going to have to downgrade your operating system to ME or 2000.
1,Doesn't Work on Windows XP,"I got so excited after hearing rave reviews about Black and White. I washed a few cars to get the money to buy the game, and on the day I bought it, I was saddened when the game didn't work! It installed properly, but after the startup screen, the whole computer screen went white! I could still hear the music in the background, but nothing else worked. I went online to try and find a remedy to my problem, and I learned that Black and White doesn't work on the Windows XP home edition. So I took it back. I'm just so disappointed. I'm sure it's a good game, but I may never find out."
1,Misleading info about system requirements,"I got this game when it first came out and was really looking forward to it. And I wish I could tell you how great it was. Or even how bad it was. However, I can't because even though I have Windows 98, this game wouldn't even load up. I called EA's customer support and they told me that there was nothing they could do. Since I had already opened the game (as I had planned on keeping it), I was out $50 for nothing but a blank screen.Moral? Make double sure that your system will run a game before you buy it. And even then, you're sometimes not out of the woods."
4,Does for Civilization what Dungeon Siege does for Diablo 2,"Graphically this game is pretty good it was maid in 2001 so it is not going to have the greatest graphics. But for the type of game it is they are good. The premise is you are a god and you determine how a town and they're culture will develop. You can be a good god and tend to they're every need or you can be a bad god and torture and kill them for fun. You also get a creature to raise to be good or evil. Good and he will help you're town bad and he will help destoy it. I played this game for 4 hours then I realized that was the training section. So needless to say this game will take along time to beat. I have played for 15 hours or so now and have barely started. This is a good game for people that like RPG's, Strategy games, and Simulation games. Why did I give it a 4 this game is not for everyone. It does not have a lot of action. When you're creature fights with other creatures it is not like Mortal Kombat."
2,A disappointment,"The game Black and White has some good ideas, such as being God and being able to control what was going on, but it did not meet up to the expectations. I find it really difficult to get the hang of the mouse controls, and at times it is extremely frustrating. I agree with one of the other comments made, you are following a story. You never are really in control! I find this game disappointing and I suggest looking else where for a game in which you want control."
2,Relieved to see it isn't just me!,"I was excited about B&W; in concept, and started out with great intentions of enjoying it. It is beautiful! However, I quickly learned that my creature was obsessed with its own [bathroom] habits . . . that I really hated my obnoxious ""good"" creature . . . that the wood'n'food were more arbitrary than not . . . and that it is almost impossible to get some of what are supposed to be simple puzzles (the early ones) to stay solved.I'm disappointed and don't recommend this game."
3,Very Choppy,I would have to say that this is a pretty fun game and has a lot of original ideas in it. The downside of this game is that it is incredibly choppy and slow. I have an AMD 933MHz Thuderbird processor and an NVidia TNT2 graphics card with 128 megs RAM. This game would be great if it wasn't so terribly choppy. But maybe it is just because I have a Compaq computer wich is the most terrible computer that you can possibly buy. ... ...
4,Great if you want no social life.,"Electronic Arts had really outdone themselves this time with the creation of Black and White - but the game is very long and mildly redundant. The game play is rather original, and if you have a good computer with at least a 32mb video card, you can see some really decorative graphics. If you want to own this game to play once in a while (or for multiplayer LAN) then that's fine, but don't buy this game if you plan on beating it in a week or two (or a month at that). Bottom line: Fun game, very original, but I just didn't have the attention span to make it through the long haul."
4,Great for the control-freak in all of us!,"Did you like Creatures? What about Dungeon Keeper? How about Settlers? Oh, and don't forget Civilization. This game seems to have the very best elements from SO many of my favorite games! It's amazingly addictive... I can't get enough of it! So what will your creature be? Are YOU a blessing... or a curse?"
2,too many bugs.,black and white is a fun game with great graphics which could have done well.the main problem is you buy the game and find you cant play it for all the bugs and glitches.the games support is also poor.there is talk of a patch but i think b/w is gonna be one of those games that will never run as it should no matter how many fix it patches lionhead/ea come up with.i give it about 5 out of ten .but if your computer is not at least double the recommended minimum requirements stay well clear
4,Decent...Borrow it,"I believe that many people buy this game hoping to have gigantic creatures and raining down hell and throwing villagers around -which can be done- but it is offput by a VERY annoying system of village management...and whenever you want to change your alignment it takes forever to change. As for your creature, It takes hours and hours of playing to make him big enough to really have FUN, and the game is only 5 levels long! It's simply not worth what it costs, despite an appealing show of graphics and humor. Worth trying so that you can have a bit of fun, but by Dune 2000 or Settlers or Citizen Kabuto instead."
5,Beat that!,"Free rotation, look at your sky or your feet, turn left, right, back and forth. Zoom in or press F3 to fully zoom out. Place bookmarks and fly among them like a kite. Or simply TAB to jump from one Village granary to the next one.Yeah... beat that!Internet weather, talk and online gaming...Well... enough said... gotta go to playAbel K."
1,Not again!,"I have to admit this game is a bit of a dissapointment! Ive been waiting for the release of this game for more than a year, and to tell you the truth, its not that entertaining at all. The controls are awful and the graphics are sometimes very choppy, (me having a Pentium3). I'm in to a lot of stratedgy game eg AOE2, but this just wasn't my cup of tea!"
2,Quite buggy,"Well, it's not a bad game. But it's very buggy.Seriously, it's missing half the features and crashes a lot."
2,Not that fun,"I had heared a bunch of good stuff about this game, so I tried it. I don't see what everyone else is so pleased with. The controls are agrivating, or at least they were to me. I do agree that the graphics were nice, but the game itself is not that enjoyable. If you think you'd still like to try the game, feel free, but there are much better games out there."
1,Frustrating!,"I played this game for about a month, but it got so tedious and frustrating that I quit. I am 12 years old and I've beaten Civilization III and other games like that but this game I just couldn't finish. Do yourself a favour, and don't even try it."
1,All the game play excitement of an empty bag of rice cakes,"Not so much a game as an intelligence test (i.e., are you smart enough to figure out how to install it?), Black & White was something I longed to play -- and am still longing for. You have to question the common sense of the people behind this game -- my copy was shipped without the essential CD identification code necessary to install the program. After hours investigating online FAQs and making expensive long distance calls to technical support, I discovered that the game assumes you will be connected to the Internet and that, if you are not, a line must be added to the program shortcut just to get the program to run. And I don't have the space here to talk about the game's arthritic speed.In short, the chief fun behind this game will be ripping the box and documentation it came with into shreds and then burning it."
1,Could be a good game,"I've been playing PC games for over ten years, and have overcome countless problems to get them to work..... but I've never encountered anything as frustrating as this game! I've followed all the tech help, checked drivers, closed down all background programs, etc etc. yet the game is incredibly unstable. Random exits, crashing when saving or loading, any of the most annoying things you can imagine happen in this game. I have many games, recent and old, on my hard drive and none make problems for me.All this wouldn't be enough for a bad review had not about half the people I've talked to about this game have the same problems.As for the game..... seems good even though I keep playing the same bits over and over, but it all means nothing if it doesn't work.What on earth were they doing for three years?"
2,Disapointing,"I feel compelled to lower the average rating of this game. People should not spend money on it. I normally like god games, but this game gives the genre a bad name.Black and White is slow and tedius. I spent all my time getting wood to the villagers, food to the worshipers, and telling the villagers where to build everything. Unless they are being hurt by another god, the villagers should have been smart enough to fend for themselves.Black and White is not all bad. I like the spell interface, where you make shapes with the cursor to pick spells, and I like the idea of needing to impress your villagers to keep them under your control. Also, the graphics are great.But the game is just not fun."
2,Black & Blue!,"That's the color of my forhead after banging it against a brick wall while playing this game.So much potential just flushed down the pan, great concept, great visuals, great sound effects, lousy gameplay.I soooo wanted to like this game but in the end its a bitter disapointment, buy a Settlers game instead or even better check out Startopia, the demos great and the game is out any day now."
1,Overhyped/Overpriced? You Betcha!,"I have to add myself to the list of people who were excited by the marketing and burned by the execution. I haven't experienced the technical problems expressed by most ... but I have to agree that the management of villages is overly cumbersome, and the supposedly amazing AI of the Creature is amazing only in how little it truly produces. Add to this an interface that's so intricate it makes hand-looming look simple, and you have the makings of a legendary waste of time and money. This one simply doesn't pay off for the gamer."
3,Great game but it's not happy with Windows XP,"The game is absorbing and keeps both myself and my kids (9 & 11) well occupied. Graphics are good but despite not being an ""action"" game the real hardware requirements seem quite high. Be wary of moving to Windows XP - B&W had run happily in multi-login Win ME but I've had a lot of problems trying to get it to run on a non-admin account in Win Xp pro; the game keeps on not seeing that it has already been installed and trying to reinstall itself. Got round this eventially by reinstalling the 1.10 patch for each user, which is not elegant but works. I shoudl say that several games (including MS ones!) suffer from related problems. But overall a good game which will last a long while on my HD"
1,should have listened,I should have listened to the negative reviews this game recieved before i purchased it. this game is cool at first but very quickly becomes boring. ive only had it for about to weeks and i dont even play anymore. lots if bugs too watch out. hope i can help out someone from buying this subpar game.
1,A Typical Electronic Arts Pile o Crud,"While graphically a very appealing game, it was forced out the door way too early by Electronic Arts in what has become their modus operandi.There any many issues with this game, the most unacceptable of which are the presence of bugs which do not allow you to finish the game. Also occasionally, the game crashes. Basically, it is a late beta, not a release version.Most companies would've released a couple of patches by now to deal with their customer's issues - but not Lionhead and EA. In the two months since release there have been ZERO gameplay/bug patches, with every promised date for a patch's release missed with excuses ranging from key personnel at E3 to waiting for quality control signoff from Electronic Arts.Quality Control from EA. Now, that's funny."
1,Cost,Why does it cost $300?? Please let this make sense to me. like shouldn't it make sense that it should not cost so high?
2,"Cute concept, yet quite dull","I enjoy animals, and this game makes great use of them.However, I have found this game to be a bit lacking in the entertainment department, and the creatures in the beginning are quite strange, to say the least (a cow...?).The controls are also very frustrating; I wish they were more like the Sims or Zoo Tycoon, which are similar (execution-wise) to this game.I want to like this, but I'm sorry EA Games, I just can't."
4,How come it has to be so much fun?,"People who like this genre of gaming should really pick this game up. It is a lot of fun, but playing it over excessively will make you shelf it sooner than you should. The AI is absolutely amazing, teaching my animal things was just awesome. The sound could have been better, but it was good. The visuals are not defining a new age of graphics, but they are survivable. The playability of this game is long, it won't bog you down as fast as Diablo II.The system requirements are a little high, but most real gamers don't care about that (they already have a beautifully rigged system). I can tell you safely that the replay value is high, there are many different scenarios you can put yourself in. My favorite is atonement, where I would be evil and than try to make up for it by being nice.GET THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY AND PLAN TO PLAY IT FOR A LONG TIME"
3,"Good,Bad . Black or White","This game is good for some things but for others no preety not,this game is to choose between being a bad or a good god some cool things are: 1-Throw the villagers. 2-burn dead people. 3-saving people. and more... But the controls are to hard to do miracles moving the mouse in different ways. This game is good but beware with some bugs and it can contain innadictive portions of black boring skies."
3,Black & White,A flawed masterpiece. Great graphics and sound with a dell p500. Demands a lot from your computer hardware. Fun at first but grows tedious.
1,Don't waste your money.,Potential for a good game if they ever fix the bugs. But I have had my game two months now and no patch has been released. The developers continually promise a patch and then delay for new features. Why add new features until the game works.
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"This is the most frustrating game i have ever played. it would always take several minutes to actually get the game running, and it was constantly freezing. then, on the fourth island, it froze for the final time- now i can't even load my games, it just restarts. this could have been a great game, but it turned out to be a huge disapointment. the customer support is awful as well. if i could have given it less than one star, i would have."
2,Black and White,"This review is to anyone who hasn't purchased this game but is thinking of doing so. If you are reading these reviews then you are probably not sure. Allow me to help you. If you have or may possibly have suffered from migrains or other chronic headaches, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is not bad at first, but after a while, it hurts. For those of you who don't, buy and enjoy."
1,Zero Stars for a Zero Sum game!,"Too bad I'm not able to leave a Zero Star. I played this game up to three campaigns. The micromanagement was futile and so was my creature assistant. During the third campaign, I was trying to micromanage as best as I could - gain resources. I realized I spent nearly an hour pulling trees for wood, that's it. A major premise of the game is like pulling digital e-weeds. I changed my game deity's name to ""The Weed-Pulling Garden Gnome"" - Finally frustrated, I swore on my own name, ""By the dirty fingers of the Weed-Pulling-Garden-Gnome-God! Gawd! This game sucks!"""
1,...,"I have a P3 850, and this game runs slow and clumsy. The interface is overwhelmingly confusing and there just doesnt seem to be that much point to the game. Sure, killing your subjects is fun and the pet feature is nice. However, the interface/controls are simply to complex. I dont know about you, but I am going back to Civ II and SC3000. Skip Black and White.."
4,FRUSTRATING controls!,This is a really fun game but the controls for movement of yourself and your creature are extremely frustrating! You are constantly off-center and trying to focus or running into mountains and trying to turn around and zooming in and out only to find your are zooming on something you didn't want to zoom on. The game is incredibly cool so I could not rate it a 3 but omg they need to do some work on easier handling; maybe take some tips from the ppl who made Everquest. It really is a shame to ruin a great game that way! I would play it much more often if it didn't anger me so.
3,A week of Fun,"It's fun - for about a week. After you've sacrificed a bunchof little kids on the altar and set your foolish little peopleto (...) all day, you realize that this game is a bit tooeasy.So, you decide to spend some time raising that perfect lil'creature. You teach him how to poop near people, to eat his ownpoop(he doesn't follow this command anymore - that punk!), andevery now and then, eat people. Oh Goodie... He can do thesetricks. What a wondie lil AI. Right...not. It's fun. After you'vetaught every little conceivable tricks (which he doesn't followanymore cause he's TOO SMART- i.e. does what ever he likeswhenever he likes), the game is simply about HOW FAST YOU CANCLICK ON TREES TO GAIN RESOURCES."
2,Disappointing,"the idea was great, but the gameplay was terrible-- cool graphics, great characters, but it's not easy to control, and the concepts are kinda counter-intuitive. . ."
2,Almost a good game.,"The idea of this game was great. Even the execution of the game was good as far as graphics and quality of work. The problem is that the game is boring. You end up spending all of your time doing monotonous things while trying to train a creature who doesn't want to learn, and doesn't use what he has learned. I feel I wasted my money on this purchase."
2,"Interesting, but too much work for a game","Way too much micromanagement, and inside tricks you have to learn about via the internet or a strategy guide. It does have great graphics, and is interesting to look at. I personally don't agree with their interface choice when casting 'miracles' which require you to draw out a symbol with your mouse - just give us a key, or a key that pulls up a menu."
4,"Super fun, with a caveat","I highly recommend this title if AND ONLY IF you do not use Win XP. I got to play it on my old desktop with Win ME and it was great; however, it simply won't work on most XP systems. On this website, it clearly states that the game isn't supported by XP, but one doesn't always think of these things when you are at the local gaming/electronics store. As I learned after wasting $20..."
2,"Great idea, terrible interface","I read some of the reviews complaining about the interface of this game, but I had to go and find out for myself. What is the point of game that is supposed to be interesting and entertaining if you get frustrated just trying to interact with the user interface? Also, my PC has P3 733 MHz processor, 384 Megs of RAM and an Nvidia TNT M64 video card and my PC had trouble handling it.On the other hand, I really like the music and the concept. I just wish it had been executed better."
5,an aquired taste,"WARNING: NOT FOR EVERYBODY!! this game is geared towards a specific sect of gamers: people who 1. have alot of time (it took me 6 hours to get through the 1st 2 worlds), 2. like to micromanage complex systems of economies (each village has its own problems). Personaly I loved it and would recomend it to my friends. The creature AI was cool, you can let them wander and(if you teach them the right things) they will help your villages, lessening the load on you"
1,"Good concept, bad implementation, terrible support","The concept of the game is good. The replayability of it is non-existant though. You _HAVE_ to go through the tutorial whether it is the first time you are playing the game or not. You have to listen to the stupid advisor's prattle about how to move.The support is aweful. I called lionhead yesterday and they told me that there was nothing I could do about getting a refund. They have delayed the patch so many times that it has been more than 14 days since I purchased the game, so my retail outlet won't take it back. The excuses that they have used time and time again for delaying the patch have been pathetic. Our developers are at E3. Some Dutch players won't be able to play over the internet. We have to QA it.....I will never buy another product from LionHead studios."
5,So much fun!,"This game has the best features ever seen in any game! The AI is beutifull, physics is included, and it it, the best game for a long while, of its kind!"
1,A game isn't much fun when you can't get it to work,"Before purchasing Black and White, I read several reviews of mixed opinions. Some people loved it, while others hated it. Most of the negative reviews seemed to be from people with lower end machines, so I figured that with my Athlon 1.3, 512 MB memory, 64 MB video card, I wouldn't have a problem. Wrong!I've NEVER had so many problems with any software application before. It locks up on launch. It locks up in the middle of the game. It locks when the sun's out. When it's cloudy. Get the picture? The game simply doesn't run well.Go read reviews on Lionhead's website, and you'll see many of the same comments. To date, no officially supported patches are available, but you can download a ""developers version"". It's as buggy as the original release.My advice: stay away from this game unless you're willing to drive yourself mad trying to get it to run."
1,boooring,"After playing the first couple of hours, I started to like the game. Then I got addicted. But the game got very repetitive. I felt like just doing the same thing over and over again. And especially when the stupid creature gets captured again it just isn't fun anymore. Its the same stuff over and over again and it just takes long.I found myself addicted: I felt like I HAD to play. But I found no joy in playing it. It was the same stuff over and over again. And then there were those annoying characters that sing or do other annoying things. And then you find out THEY JUST WONT DIE.Damn this game is annoying.Finally I got myself to uninstall. Damn that was a relief! Now I can play other games again.. games that are actually fun! I really felt like I was relieved of a huge burden."
3,"Great concept, medicore game","The graphics and idea behind this game is spectacular, I just really didn't find it much fun. I thought it took too much effort to train the creature to do anything interesting and my interest waned quickly."
5,Black and White,"This is truly a one of a kind game. the chalenges are unique. game play is astounding, story line is everchanging. Bravo on a job well done."
3,Moving around is like walking through water,"Good Game, lots of interaction with your subjects and wonderful graphics. Interface is hard to get used to."
1,not for me,"i agree with some of the more negative critiques here. i bought this game based on the hype and reviews at the time of release. although it didnt look like something i would normally enjoy, and i didnt, i found the game cumbersome, i didnt like the games control system, and it was all a bit twee and boring. the concept left me cold to be honest, just goes to show dont believe the hype. an expensive waste of a very few hours."
1,Difficult to control,"It is really hard to zoom in zoom out or move or turn around. I am very glad that I did not buy this game. I only played this game in a cybercafe for 2 hours. After 2 hours, I still fail to solve the control problem."
1,Bad Game! Bad Game! Back to your Programmer!,"This game is truly awful. The game has an interesting concept but the realization it horrible. You're a God but the only way for you to do anything is with your free floating hand - which is close to impossible to control. Between that, the poor graphics, and the problems it caused with my system I gave up after a couple days. I wouldn't bother unless you're into frustration."
4,"Great Gameplay, awkward progression","I love this game, it's challenging enough to hold your interest, but not so much so that you get frustrated (Europa Universalis). My one complaint is that if you want to start a new creature, you have to start from scratch and go through the whole tutorial again. There may be a way to skip this, but I haven't found it yet. Online gameplay is adequate but it would be nicer is the host could set more variables, like AOE."
5,READ THIS IF YOUR GOING TO GET THIS GAME!,"Alright, let me start off this way, i bought this game and it wouldn't run. So I called technical support and they said it wouldn't run on my computer unless I got a new graphics card. If you buy this game make sure you have a graphic card with more than 8 mb of memory. If not you will have to buy one, or return it.I gave it five stars because it sounds like such a fun game and still want to play it. I want to so much that I'm going to buy a new video card for it.Anyway, this game looks good, if you really want it get it...if you have a good enough video card. It is probably a great game."
3,Playing God,"The game is a lot of fun, if you like games like The Sims. Lot of fun to play online with other people. The one problem with the game is the first two land have two much tutoring and not alot of learn form your own mistakes. Else then that the games is great."
4,Ambitious and beautiful,"This is one of those games, like the sims, that is very much a non-game and that tends to divide people into two groups. What does it have going for it? Great graphics and music, a great mood; awesome AI, novel idea, engrossing (at first). What's not to like? Controls (especially the idiotic fighting mode and the use of leashes) are clumsy, villager AI is set on sub-cretin mode, and it focuses too much on micro-management of your people, which undermines the whole ""god"" concept, turning the game into a variant of simcity or civilization, and not in a good way. This game was amazing for the first few hours, then got tedious and repetitive."
5,Forget any doubts...,"My friend and I went to the mall yesterday and camped out at the store that was to recieve Black and White. My friend was the first to get it, right out of the UPS delivery boxes. I told him ""Let's not expect too much, because that only means we can be disappointed"". How wrong I was. We installed it, and began playing. Incredible is about all I can say. I didn't know how incredible until just last night and this morning. I played this game for like 10 hours straight. I didn't get any sleep tonight, and unfortunately, I don't think I will be getting sleep for awhile longer. I don't want to go into the details because half of the joy is finding out the little touches in the game for yourself, but make no mistake: this is the game to buy. Im gonna go play some more."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","After nearly 2 years of development you would think they could have worked the bugs out before shipping. But alas, it never works that way. The game is buggy, not unplayable but definitly still in the beta phase. And to make matters worse THERE IS NO PATCH. Oh they keep saying one is coming but every time the posted date for it comes around they post that it will be anywhere from 4 more days to 2 or 3 more weeks. I didn't buy the game when it first released for just that reason. The first time i checked bwgame.com the patch was supposed to be out may 21st. Now (June 4th) they just posted that it would be another 2 or 3 weeks. This is not acceptable, Lionhead doesn't deserve this bad review but EA does, sorry Peter Molyneux."
1,A nice coaster until the patch comes out.,"I would not recommend this game. There are way to many bugs. I can't start the game unless i run it with a /NOINETCONN switch which disables internet play. I have a kick ass computer and a cable modem and i can't even play online. Wait till the patch comes out. Then buy it. Also, like people are saying, keeping people and your creature happy can be a major pain."
4,A game that's as hard or as easy as you want it to be.,"The game is great. Many people are experiencing a lot of bugs and crashes, but for me it has run perfectly. I won't go into much detail, I will only say this: Black & White can be whatever you want it to be. It can be a fast-paced game with a lot of micromanagement, or it can be a ""sit back and enjoy the view"" type of game. The choice is yours. And if you ever wondered if you have an ""evil"" side that nobody has ever seen, this game will give you the chance to discover it and put it to use.Now for the bad parts. Lionhead and EA have not communicated well with their fans. Two times now we were told a patch would be released and it wasn't. Both LH and EA have been very unprofesional on this matter and have lost quite a few fans over it. All I can say is that if you buy this game be prepared that it might be very buggy for you and you might have to wait for the patch to be released (if it ever is) before you can really enjoy Black & White."
1,do not fall for the con,"This game will not run. Not for me or for many other people. make sure you find out the REAL system requirements, or you will be like me, -50 bucks and no game to play"
4,Very enjoyable.,I purchased this game for my 14 year old grandson. He was VERY pleased with the Black and White computer game. He played it for hours.
2,horrid game =(,"I bought this game, hoping to go home and play it. But no after I finished installing it, and started my game, I ran into numerous bugs and gliches. This game looked so promising, but it turned out to just be a horrid experience and a waste of my money. I gave it two stars for the great concept. Really is a cool idea for a game. Bottom line though don't waste your money on this game."
2,your creature needs a poo,"This box should carry a large warning saying ""unsuitable for people over 12 years old"". I've given it 2 out of 5 simply because the graphics are quite good. In every other way it is an irritating and frustrating game, as well as being patronising, inane, bland and ""twee"" in the extreme. I wish I hadn't wasted any money on it."
1,Just Black No White...,"I'll make this short but sweet. In short, this game is awesome, or would be .....in another dimension where the publishers actually left out all the bugs and actually delivered a working PATCH within a reasonable time frame."
2,Bug infested,"From all the reviews that you get to read on this game, written by either Magazines or Web Sites,it would have to be the greatest game of all time, but don't be fooled. This must be some real great marketing department, as what you are getting for you money is a highly bug infested beta of two combined companies where customer support is on the very rock bottom of things-to-do-list. If you would like to save yourself worries and trouble (and money) wait about half a year then buy it for half prive and by then some patches should be available for this game."
2,Tedious and Slow,"I've had this game for a few months now. At first I loved it. Learning about each individual element of the game (e.g., the miracles, the creature, the villagers, the islands, the opposing gods) was fun and promised for exciting gameplay. Unfortunately, knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where Black & White needs work. For instance, in order to accomplish anything, you are forced to ""increase your influence""--that is, you cannot interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence. To gain influence, you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks, trees, people, fireballs, whatever over their heads so they fear and/or are amazed by you. This becomes very tedious. It takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very fun.Alas, I wanted so much to love this game, but it's just too repetitive and slow."
3,"Fun, but semi-repetitive","""Black and White"" is a good game overall. You start out as a god who gets to control a creature to carry out tasks to the island you control. The people build things for you and worship you. The fun comes when you can be a good god or evil god, depending on your actions. Thi game is fun, but you'll probably forget about it in a couple months."
1,Don't Buy it!,"This game even with a patch not only still has many bugs, but once you install the patch many if not all could not run the game. You had to download runblack.exe or unSafeDisc to get it to even load. I had to deal with tech. daily, all they tell people is check your video drivers for update, directX is wrong, adjust the accelerator. I never was able to get Creature Isle to work. This game should have never hit the market. There has not been any mention of another patch to fix the still many bugs remaining. It's a waste of time. The only good note is that the Tech's. did reply pretty fast, even though their solutions were off the mark.Ter"
4,Great graphics,"The game engine in Black and White is amazing, and it has the most spectacular graphics I have seen in a game. The game goes at your own pace. It is a fun game, but it has a few flaws.First, you can only play the game so many times before it starts to get boring.Second, You need a powerful PC to run it. Otherwise, the game is slow and almost unplayableThird, there are still a few bugs in it. I highly recomend going to the official website to download the patch.These few downfalls shouldn't keep you from buying this wonderfully entertaining game."
3,Beautiful but...,"Rather hard to control your creature and while quite a bit of practice might help, it was annoying/difficult enough I lost interest in trying.The graphics are INCREDIBLE and the game idea is fantastic. However, just moving around the game is quite a task. The tutorial in game is pretty long yet for such an involved game it's nowhere near long enough."
3,It's not Populous,"Yes, the graphics are stunning, but gameplay gets too bogged down in minute details. If you want to burn up some time this is the game for that. My overall impression of the game is that they took the Populous premise and dumped all the details of The Settlers into the mix. In Settlers attending to the many details adds flavor to the game; in Black and White all those details simply reduce the godlike status of the player to something like slavery. The AI Creature is a nice addition, but it should learn in parallel with the main character not take perhaps half the gameplay time to train. I give this one three stars only."
2,Black and Boring,"This game has wonderful sound, beautiful vibrant colors, but thats about it. In my opinion, the game is just too slow in developing. Your ""Creature"" is a child-like being that you train to be either good or evil, which becomes an extension of you. Good concept, but very tiring after awhile. The game becomes too centered on feeding your people, giving them wood to build, keeping your ""creature"" in line- over and over, again and again. This game gets to repedative to quick. I give it two stars for graphics and sound but thats about it. 0 stars for storyline and replay-ability."
1,Over-hyped- NOT fun,"This game is NOT fun. The interface is awkward. It is too tedious to move the creature around. I am surprised that all the game sites gave this game a (very) good review. There are a few fun aspects of the game-like when you throw rocks into people's houses and stuff, but overall, the game is very boring. I probably won't play it again."
2,If you have a year to spend... do something else!,"This game takes a long time. A VERY long time. For example, each time you start a new game, you MUST go through a tutorial that if you speed through it will take you no less than 45 minutes. Teaching your pet will take longer and your pet will at any given moment learn a trick that you had no intention of it learning. If you were to have two games, one for a good pet and one for a bad one. IT would take you two hours at least of straight playing to get to the 2nd level. I commend the advanced AI and the incredible graphics, but the unbearably tedious gameplay makes this game [not worth the money], as soon as you decide that the time it takes to play the game is not worth the effort."
1,Poor planning makes this program difficult to use,"I bought this game, but have been unable to use it, although my PC meets ands exceeds the minimum system requirements listed on the box. (I'm a professional computer support staffer) Support from Lionhead has been non-existant. I Can't recommend it."
5,I love this game!,"This is one ... of a game.I have only started playing it for several hours but I love it!Basically, you are a God and as you get more worshippers, you get more power and thus your influence also grows.You control everything from moving to picking things up via a disembodied hand on the screen. What I love about this game is that anything goes. You can opt either to help your people or make their lives a living ... Someone's brother needs to saved, you can save him or you could just ... him or his sister! Bored? Toss some giant rocks at your people. Or grab one of them and toss him! Eventually, you get your own totem creature who will be your avatar and will perform deeds on your behalf.I have not gone to far into the game but so far it looks great. Stabilty wise, no slowdowns or crashes yet in almost ten hours of play so it looks okay to me."
4,Wow.... What a fun game.,"OK, first off, B&W is a great great game. Anyone who likes The Sims (sorry to make the comparision, but there is a lot in common) will like this, and many people who didn't like The Sims will still like this. I'd like to reply to something another reviewer said, in a few mistakes he said. He said there was a runtime error and it crashed, and his AutoSave was gone. Well, this same thing happened to me (and I'm looking for a patch for it), but your autosave is NOT GONE. He just doesn't know where to find it (go into the temple, save game room, the top row of saves). This can't-continue-the-game bug is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. He also said that it's all mission-based, etc. That is NOT TRUE. It is only mission-based on the first island (which he didn't get past because of the bug), because the first island is a tutorial island, teaching you how to play. It becomes much more open-ended after that. Anyway, it's a great game, now I just have to find a patch..."
2,Very Repitive and Slow,"I bought this game and I am sorry that I did. The game gets very repitive and playing with your creatures isn't all that fun because you can't really make them do a whole lot. It is cool to watch them do there own things. Another problem with the game is that is gets really repititive after awhile. Converting new tribes to advance in the game gets boring after awhile, especially since it take awhile for each one, meanwhile, your followers are never happy and you always have to keep helping them, making the process even longer.The pros to this game is that is has very different game play than any game I have played and the graphics are top grade."
2,"Ugggh, boring...","Black & White in theory sounds like a really fun game and for some I guess it is. I found the game so tedius, repititious and devoid of fun that I never even bothered to finish the first level. The idea of the creature is interesting and the AI on it is impressive but that in itself could not hold the game together. The controls are awful. It is interesting that the developers spent so much time on the ""feel"" of the game and making it so it was like no other that it seems that they didn't stop to think at the cumbersomeness an impracticality of the vast array of controls. Another factor to this game is that if you are going to stick it out and play the entire thing you will definately need time for it takes for what seems an eternity to complete some of the tasks of the game. All in all, this game was not for me but I could see the ultimate attraction and some people who are willing to stick it out might enjoy it."
1,There is only one God.......,"This game is really boring. The gameplay is superslow and there are many glitches in the software. Its also pretty blasphamus. There is only one God, and we are not him, his name is Jesus Christ. If I could give it no stars, believe me I would."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Just like everyone else, I waited forever for the release of this over-hyped ""let down"". First off, it does not work with my video driver (ATI RAGE MOBILITY). I get this annoying blue strobe. Of course getting any help out of the manufacturer is IMPOSSIBLE. The game crashes constantly and is actually really boring to play. Everyone seems to be so amazed by the graphics, but I find them average at best (I see better graphics on my playstation). Anyway, don't even waste your money and time on this ""half finished"" waste of a CD-ROM."
1,"The game is ok, but the way they handle it is BAD!!","Ok, you have to like this kind of game, but when you do... it's good. I love the gameplay, the creature, the miracles, the creature (yep, it's an important one), etc.But, i (and many with me) disagree with the way we are treated. The game is buggy, crashes a lot, you do not want to enter land 5 and your creature forgets miracles. Lionhead and EA refuse to give any information on a patch, and when they do (they gave us a release date), they do not keep their promises. This is why i rate this game bad. Don't buy it until you find a patch, because you'll get really upset at reinstalling and beginning the game all over again after 10 times."
1,"This could be a good game, but it's way too buggy.","This game is very original with good graphics. The person who thought this up was very creative. (...) However, once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs. Some of these are invisible creatures that won't move, creature won't eat or learn, creature won't interact with objects, missing sheep for sheep quest, etc. So you go download patch 1.10 and install it. Then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start. It just freezes. So you use the EAsy program to report the problem (...) and that program locks up your system. Congratulations, you have just wasted (...) your hard earned money on a (...) buggy game. (...)"
3,Patience required,"I kept killing my villagers by being too slow, but it is fun to feed them to the monkey and lion."
2,Black and White,"I thought this game would be real cool because of all the hype. When I bought it and race home to installed it I had no problems . The problem was playing this piece of junk. The game has it fun points like that fact you can smack around your creature. I did this alot because the [stupid] thing doesn't do what it is suppose to. It is very hard to move around and it was driving me crazy, everytime you race to get someone the screen gets in the way. I do not recommend this game, good idea bad planning."
1,What?,"It's as though somebody had a good idea, and then decided against it, and chose to go with what the lunchlady said instead. Avoid."
2,Crash and Burn,"Great concept, poor delivery. Once again it seems a game maker just can't seem to finish a game putting it on the market. Yo! Game maker, Test you code and them release the game. Don't unload some piece of junk that needs a mondo 90meg patch before it even begins to resemble a final product. If this game had been tested, debugged, and made playable before it was put on the shelf I probably would have given it 4 out of five. Sorry but black and white has struck out.Cheers."
3,Black and White needs more color.,"Black and White is a fun game in the begining. The graphics are pretty good and the idea is ok but there is a factor of fun missing. The game is simply put, boring. After about 20 minutes you just want to shoot yourself. The game is really draged out. After the first level you feal like you wasted your money so let me tell you, you dont have to take my advice, you have your own opinion but this game is a waste of time and money. The creaters werent very creative. So go to the store and get something better.I'm done."
3,Cute but ...,"I waited for [the price to drop] for over a year. I like RPG games and this looked unique, pretty, and interesting.Playing it wasn't the joy I'd been imagining. Even though it's been out for over a year and I have a very stable system (it never crashes for ANYTHING but Black & White) it crashed my system about an hour into the game every time I played. Which is just insane since the system is popular and over a year old --- there should be a frigging patch for it but there isn't.Also, the game controlls are overly complicated. Before deciding that it wasn't worth it I spent a good 15 hours playing the game and I was still unsure about which controls to use for certain actions. That is a serious design flaw as far as I'm concerned.It is a pretty game and if you have the patience to put up with the freezes (make sure to save) and the time to devote to it this is the game for you. The graphics are pretty and it is really cute -- just overly complicated and buggy."
3,Eh.,"I thought it was too difficult to control and it ran very slowly on my system (PIII 500mhz, 256 MB RAM). The idea is good, but the game needs some more tweaking to be really really good."
4,Give your worshippers heaven or hell on earth,"This is a fairly good game. You play the God of a group of islands and decide why they worship you:- Because you are good and give them anything they needor- Because you destroy them if they don't.You also have to choose a creature which you have to train. The way how you train it will decide whether is will be good or evil.If you always wanted to have absolute power, this is your chance: BUY IT!!!"
3,Interface woes,"Sure, this is one phenomenal game - the stuff it's trying to do far eclipses anything we've seen before. Problem is, it tries too hard. I still have trouble with the interface control after hours of playing, I can't get my beastie to be good (just evil), and those freakin' villagers are a constant pain. In the words of Edward de Bono: ""Simplify, simplify!"""
3,good game but awkward in places,"I am a big fan of the god games and Black & White is quite unique among the genre. B&W can be very challenging and is one of the few games that make you think about how to do well. Learning how to manage your creature is one of the most difficult aspects. The management of the villagers isn't very different from other games, though they can be quite demanding. Visually the game is excellent.My biggest problem with the game is the interface. Moving around the island with the hand icon is a pain. Since the game is realtime I found it very frustrating to have to waste time positioning myself to get the best view of what is happening.My only other problem is that the game seemed to grow very tedious in some sections. Players can spend many hours in B&W and the more repetative sections made me lose interest in the game.Black & White is a very challenging game. If you don't mind the awkward interface this is the game for you."
1,Don't buy it.,Great concept. I'll give it that. But if you want a game so bug ridden you can't even finish it then buy Black and White. They have offered no tech support what-so-ever. The patch has been delay 3 time now and they always have horrible excuses about why it's delayed. First time some ISP in norway or Sweden couldnt connect after the game is patched. Next the need to make sure the patch works with P4 processors.Like I said if you want a game that doesn't work and has no tech support to speak of then buy this wonderful little gem.
2,It would be a fun game if you could play it.,"The longer you play this game the slower it runs with load and save game times being from five to ten minutes. Lots of crashs to desktop while saving, which means you get to start the game again and endure the tutorials. After four or five times this gets rather annoying. Lionhead and EA have been slow in providing a game patch and have given only usless technical help. It is a shame that a fun game can be ruined by the very people who create it. Well, they did get their money from the sale of the game. Is this all they care about? Maybe they should start to worry about future sales."
2,Interesting but disappointing,"I bought Black and White mostly because of the hype, and was intriqued by the gameplay. Unfortunately the many technical problems with the game and lack of support from the developer have made the game unplayable after only a couple of weeks. It's become clear that what is on the shelf is a beta version of the game. I stongly recommend holding off on buying this game until a new version is released that has the bug fixes and missing features."
4,"Cool, but Somewhat Tedious","Molyneux's achievement is truly remarkable. No one has done these sorts of things in video games before. During the first two weeks that I owned it, I was continually discovering new features and nuances of the game play. The graphics are brilliant and colorful, the world is rich and subtle, and the characters are hilarious. You can think of this game as a combination of ""The Sims"" and a real-time strategy game. Likewise, it has all the features that made ""Creatures"" fun, without all of the headaches of micro-management. While this game is both beautiful and exhilarating, it should be said that it is time consuming and sometimes exhausting. Some evenings I found myself not wanting to play because it was ""too much commitment"". Molyneux's goal was to make a living, breathing world and he was successful, but the unfortunate side effect is that sometimes that's exactly what we are trying to escape when we play games."
3,Some accurate information,"This product was taken from a vinyl copy of the Together version It was not produced by Gary Usher.(he was co-owner of Together Records) He didn't meet the Byrds until after Meltcher and Stanton produced them at CBS (now Sony) When CBS and Rhino released their versions, these tapes were not returned from Together, which used Keith Olsen mixes. The new Sundazed (shorter version) is made from those recovered Olsen tapes, the long version is all new mixes made by Bob Irwin. Poptones no longer has any right to re-produce Preflyte The Sundazed long version includes everything recorded by the Byrds pre CBS. The short version IS the original Preflyte.(including a reproduction of the cover)Jim Dickson (producer)"
3,Is This Preflyte?,"I remember my brother buying the Columbia version of this album on 8 track many years ago and all the fun we used to have singing along to it. So naturally I was very excited to see that it was coming out on CD (finally). But is this really ""Preflyte""? It sounds a lot like the versions used for the ""In The Beginning"" CD. I distinctly remember ""You Showed Me"" and ""Mr.Tambourine Man"" being a lot slower then the versions on this new CD. Also, the vocals on ""You Showed Me"" were more of a group sound then just one singer. I personally think these are either the same takes used on ""In The Beginning"" or different takes all together. Does anyone else notice this?"
1,Hopeful,"I have been all over your web page and have been trying to purchase two 24 cartons of Mighty Dog Gourmet Food and have been very unsuccessful. What do I have to do to purchase these items? The web page indicates two new, but I only want the one as a double order."
2,A point here and a point there and a lot of [nothing] in between,I think this story is pretty stupid. I picked it up thinking it would be good and it wasn't. It is not. Sara is absolutely horrible to her little sister. She makes way too much mischeif. But you can understand why she says some of the things she says. I would not recommend this book unless you like books that scare you and make you check ahead to let you know whether things will be all right.
3,Sara's really a bad influence for all of us!,"Mrs. Sherwood, who is Emily's (narrator) mother and some of us agree: Sara Slater is a bad influence. The girls are 12, and Sara teaches Emily how to smoke. Sara teaches her to trick Sara's little sister. And when Emily stands up to her bad influence, they fight. And Emily's a good child. Sara's just a bad influence for all 12-year-old girls who may read this."
5,best rice sticks out there,"This is our favorite rice sticks brand. We were getting very tired of competing with people to get this at a local grocery store, often sold-out. Now we're very glad that Amazon.com carries it with much better price (and free shipping)."
4,"Delicious,","These are sometimes hard to find so ordering from Amazon is great. As a celiac, I depend on rice a great deal and these are quick cooking with NO ADDITIVES other than rice and water. Always check ingredients. Some other products of this kind of various, unpronounceable additions."
4,Great Lights cheap relay!,I love the lights and the quality of them is top notch. I do not care for the cheap relay that failed after only 1 day of use. I ended up using 2 40amp relays (one for each light) and now I am happy. The install was straight foward and easy overall.
4,Happy with them,"I installed these on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ) so i can see better off-road. I haven't taken them off the pavement yet, but have used them on a dark road and am really impressed. the only thing i'm a LITTLE bit disappointing is the wideness of the beam is dimmer than expected. you can still see off to the sides, just not as bright as where the beam points. and i thought it would be the same brightness. i don't like the yellow smiley face covers either, but i'll be picking up the stone guards real soon."
5,Good buy,"Very good price. Very good lights. Easy install, promt delivery. ALOT brighter than high beams. No need to spend more money on different brands, go with the original. You won't be dissapointed."
2,Very disappointing,"Unlike the series 2 trading stickers, this 24 pack only has 3 different sticker options which means a LOT of duplicates. I was also disappointed in the scan quality of these stickers."
2,"Not the best choice, unless...","Lots of great Christmas songs here, but unless you really want a melody-line tab, you should get the ""Ultimate Guitar Christmas Fake Book"" instead. And, if all you need is chord names (not chord boxes), just get the Ultimate Christmas Fake Book. You get 50-70 more songs with the other fake books, and there's nothing here that isn't in the other books."
5,Fun book for all skill levels.,"Great book for all levels and all Christmas song preferences. Has the actual guitar tab too, which is my favorite part of the book."
5,Good HDTV antenna,"I had this temporarily setup on a pole/mast in the house next to my Terk amplified indoor antenna and it got about the same reception. I was underwhelmed but was ok with it since I bought it for the roof, where my Terk can't go.Then, I realized I had my in-line amplifier connected wrong, then wow, after amplification the DB4 clearly did it's job better indoor or outdoor. It's on my roof now and pulling in NBC in High Point reliably from Greensboro which is listed to be 35 miles away. before amplification it was apparently on the fringe and would go out with the weather (I have a lot of dense trees), now it's good.not only that, it indeed is fairly omni-directional as I'm only pointing at the weakest channel and it's pulling everything else at full green bars within a 30 mile range.lastly, the square grid is relatively small and hardly noticeable on a roof compared to a dish or large traditional vhf/uhf antenna. make sure you have a good mast to mount it to."
3,Might work but isn't a VHF antenna,"This antenna didn't work for us. When my husband first plugged it in, it picked up channels while sitting on a bench outside. We were thrilled until it lost the channel and we also found that it won't pick up most of our local channels because they are VHF and this antenna is only a UHF antenna. When I searched for VHF-UHF antennas, this antenna came up, but it is ONLY a UHF antenna. Amazon was great with the return process and refunded our money quickly."
3,This is a UHF only antenna,"I bought this antenna based on user reviews on amazon.com. It is a compact, easy-to-install antenna. Not being that familiar with difference transmission bands, at the time of purchase, I did not pay attention to the fact that this antenna is a UHF only antenna. Hence, I cannot receive abc or nbc channels using this product as they use VHF band. I am in the process of buying another antenna that works for both UHF and VHF. I wish the product description was more informative on its capabilities, though it does mention that it works for the entire UHF spectrum which at the time to me did not help recognize that it was not VHF capable."
2,Buyer Beware!!,"Be certain that you know what you are buying. This antenna came highly recommended by other Amazon reviewers, but it has a serious shortcoming. While it is an attractive unit and is easy to install, it is UHF ONLY. I receive two of the three major networks in perfect HD. ABC, however, is missing, as is the local PBS. I talked with a technician at PBS about my problem. In his professional opinion both UHF and VHF are necessary for adequate HD reception. As I understand it from him, what I really need is an antenna which resembles a 747. Prices for these are similar to that of the DB4. So, be certain that UHF is all you will need before you order a DB4."
4,tv antennas,"Good reception. Installed in attic. Have had digital freeze of picture, or weaking of the siginal. This hasn't happened often. Good picture 98% of the time.I live 23 miles, in a hilly area, away from the farthest station. I would recommend this attenna."
4,better than rabbit ears...,"received antenna with some elses paperwork including stating being returned due to ordering the wrong model. That freaked me out a little, but antenna was not damaged. I has hoping to have antenna in the attic but after some testing decided it had to be mounted outside to work the best. Antenna does work better than rabbit ears but I don't get the 20 stations like other users, but a did double my stations, so for that I am happy."
5,DB4 Antenna,"Haven't finished my setup but after getting it I hooked it up inside the house, pointed somewhat towards the towers, which are 22 miles away and with a little trial and error got 100% HD signal. Was concerned about picking up a high end VHF HD station but based on my research and that it was channel 12.1 it came in at 100%. So far so good. Should work great once on top of the house."
5,Great Little Antenna,This antenna is really good. I live 40 miles from the towers and I can pull in most of the channels without having to rotate. I do wish it were a little more multi directional so that I could pull in NBC along with the others. As it is I have to choose between NBC and all of the rest. Great antenna though!
5,Great Option vs Cable for HD,I was tired of paying a large cox cable bill every month. I don't watch a lot of TV but when I do I really enjoy HD for sports and news in the morning. Problem was I had to pay for every package to have HD through my cable service. This antenna was the solution and it far exceeded my expectations. I put it in my attic - ran a cable down to my TV that has an internal HD and digital tuner and I was done. Now I have one remote - no cable bill - and perfect - crystal clear digital and HDTV. Very happy with this purchase!
5,Excellent Antenna,DB4 antenna is mounted eight feet above the ground. I am twenty to thirty miles south of Charlotte NC television transmitters.I am 2 miles east of downtown Fort Mill SC. This antenna pulls in all channels with no amplifier. I have it attached to a 55 inch Sony HDTV and the picture is excellent.
1,Disappointed in both the product and company,"The DB4 HDTV antenna is a disappointment. I live in the Los Angeles area and should have no problem receiving signals from as close as 25 miles away, however, this antenna does not receive them. I have contacted the company regarding it and have not heard a response. I would like to return it, but am not sure how to do so."
4,Wonderful Antenna,This antenna provides a great HDTV picture better than cable any day. I would tell anyone who wants a great picture and does not like paying for basic cable which provides less channels than this antenna to buy it.
4,"good, good and saves money ;)",It works well in our area... we have more than 30 channels; with an indoor one we could catch only 10! Sometimes when is cloudy or air traffic is heavier can have some disturbances.
4,better than internal antenna,"I had an around $70 internal antenna but had many ""no signal""s, living within Chicago city and being 6 miles from Willis Tower. Bought this external antenna tow months ago and the reception has been much better, though still have a few ""no signal"" events. Like it and love the sharp high quality digital TVs.It can be used indoor and brings better reception too."
5,Works Great,"I got fed up with paying DirecTv $80 per month and decided to take the plunge into the world of streaming content. I don't regret it one bit. The DB4 antenna helps complete my setup. Living in Dayton, Ohio this allows me, not only to get my Dayton channels clearly, but also Cincinnati's and all of the stations in Columbus as well. Installation was a breeze. It easily attached to the ""J"" tube already mounted on my roof for the DirecTv dish. I hooked up the cable and pointed it towards the area where the local stations are located and that was it - done deal."
2,DB4 Multi-Directional HDTV Antenna,"I guess it serves its purpose, but the reception is no better than the amplified rabbit ears we were using before."
5,Surprised!,"Read reviews on outdoor antennas for about 6 months and the db4 kept coming back to the top of the list. So I ordered the db4 and was amazed at its reception. I had it setting on a shelf next to my tv in my shop and i was picking up a channel as far away as 65 miles. Reception was a bit choppy but when i put it up about 20' Crystal Clear is all I can say about it. Didnt pick up many channels but the ones i do recieve are great. Also, I am in a remote area but pick up channels in both directions.........."
1,What do you get for around $50 ??,Not much!!! Very flimsy product that is made in Taiwan and has about 10 bucks worth of metal in it. A classic case of importing something that costs next to nothing and fleecing the American public.I took down my old Radio Shack antenna I bought over 16 years ago to upgrade to this antenna. With the Radio Shack antenna I was getting only 8 channels after the digital switch.....but now.... I am only getting 6 channels with this high tech alumunum beer can. I am about 30-40 miles from Philadelphia so I had high hopes that this would improve my reception situation. Not even close!!!I wish I had never bought this antenna and had just left what I had up there alone. What a waste!!!!
1,"DB4 not as good as ""rabbit ears'","DB4 did not perform nearly as well as channelmaster 4010 ""rabbit ears"" when tested at two different locations with two different hd tv sets"
1,What a waste of $,"I had been using a standarg HD antenna for 6 months (Phillips, $24). I just installed the DB4 with the preamp and my reception is no better than before. At least with the old HD antenna, when the signal pixelated I could get up and turn the antenna in different directions. Now I just get on Hulu to watch most shows because this antenna is no better."
2,Waste of money,"Very weak! live about 15 to 18 miles from antenna towers and this antenna is a waste of money... After messing with this for a few hours trying to get better reception i disconnected it and put back my (rabbit ears) and get way better reception from the local stations..DON'T waste your money. You can buy mine for cheap, if anybody still wants to try this antenna.."
2,Antennas Direct DB4 Multi Directional HDTV Antenna,"Purchased Antennas Direct DB4 Multi Directional HDTV Antenna and set up it on the roof of my house.Application: Sharp Aquos 46 "" HDTV LCD 1080p.Area: Santa Ana California 92704Issues: Rotated the antenna 360 degree to get VHS channels, but could not get the channel 2. I do not know why.Any advices or helps?.Thanks."
1,Did not meet my expectations,"The product description for this product did not clearly mention it as a outdoor antenna. Once I received I was shocked to see the appearance of this antenna and later realized that it is a outdoor antenna from the labeling on the box and inside instructions.Regardless of that , I installed this antenna and I was expecting a good signal compared to the indoor table top antenna I had but that was not the case.May be I cannot installed this inside the house since this is outdoor antenna.Though this is not something you would like to see in your living room I wanted to try anyways but no luck with the signal even though I was prepared to compromise on the appearance of the living room.Again this is a outdoor antenna if you are thinking otherwise."
4,Oven rack HDTV antenna,I wanted an antenna to mount in my attic. I chose the DB4 for its double size knowing that attic mount cuts the signal by half. The DB4 works perfect.
3,it's okay,"The plastic box to connect the co-ax cable seems to be fairly weak. The antenna does a pretty good job of bringing in the HDTV signals. It would have been nice if the company offered different mounting solutions. Not so much as hardware, but ideas would have been nice."
1,Multi-directional -NOT!,Doesn't work for me. I was lucky to get 2 channels. My indoor antenna worked better than this piece of junk.
4,"Way better than the old, large antennas...in so many ways","This is the most compact, efficient, antenna I've tried for television reception. The DB4 is not twice as good as the DB2 (at least not in East Texas where I live), but the 4 is noticeably better in signal strength. I'd recommend this for anyone wanting to have local HD TV without paying for it. The key is elevation on the antenna. As high as you can safely go."
3,NO GREEN BAY PACKERS -- AUGH!!!,"It turns out the ONLY station in and around Green Bay is broadcast on VHS, which this antennae cannot receive. Other than that, it works great. I am about 60 miles NW of GB and with an amp, receive 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 14.1, 26.1 (most of the time), and 38.1, 38.2, and 38.3. But without 11.1 to see the Packer games, whats the use?"
5,Great HD reception 28 miles out of Chicago,"Very impressed with this antenna. Live in a burb of Chicago about 28 miles from the city, and easily receive all HD broadcasts, even CBS and ABC which were nearly impossible to receive prior.The antenna is very compact and easily mounted on the mast. I installed mine in my attic, and am still receiving signal strengths over 80/100 on most channels, with most actually over 90/100. If not for having trouble initially installing the F-connectors on the Quad Shielded RG-6 coaxial cable, and routing the cable, it would have taken minutes to install.Have only had it up and running a week, but am very pleased and impressed with the product."
3,This is a UHF only antenna !!! Beware !!!,Make sure you pay close attention when you go to antennaweb.org and look at the band (UHF/VHF) your TV stations requires. In my area (Wash DC) ABC and CBS are on VHF and all the other channels are on UHF.Well obviously I am not getting any reception for CBS and ABC. Big bummer !!!
4,Great Antennas,"This really is a great product. I have this going to an amp, which splits into two channels. One channel is going to my TV, the other to an HDHomeRun box (with two channels). I use Mythbuntu to record and everything works REALLY well! Great reception. The SNR doesn't really move much and with the amp in line, I can add a little gain to it (too much and the SNR starts moving).The bad thing though, I ordered three antennas, I had one casualty. I emailed the seller who stated I would be getting a replacement, that was three months ago. I've emailed them since then, no reply. Still think this is a good deal though.If I ever get my replacement antenna, then I'll change this to 5 stars."
4,Better than Bunny Ears,I was using bunny ears in a central room in my house and I found putting this Antenna in the attic with little to no pointing got the same channels as the bunny ears and a few more. This is a directional antenna so im sure if I play with it some more it would be far better than the bunny ears.
4,"Works great, easy to set up.","Came in box basically assembled. We hooked it up inside and immediately doubled the channels we were receiving and improved the quality of all channels. We are receiving multiple HDTV channels now, it is great-- we receive almost all major stations in HD as well as SD now! We are 20-50 miles from the various stations in our area with multiple obstacles-- buildings, airport, etc nearby. Right now the antenna is in our living room, we will move it outside soon, so I expect we will pick up even more channels when we do that, we are 20 miles from the nearest city and another major city is about 70 miles away. Only 4 stars, as there is no pole to mount it to but other than that, I am extremely pleased. For some reason my tag says we are in Boston. We are actually near Sacramento, CA."
3,Not what I had hoped for or expected,"The attenna was delivered and was easy to assemble as advertised. While reception improved (over my old rabbit ears), it only improved signal strength maybe 50% at the most. That is not very impressive considering where I was starting out. In addition, I was not able to pull in some more distant stations that are normally part of my normal coverage area. There may be some line-of-sight issues, but considering the height of my property, even reasonably close transmission towers provide only adequate signals and often suffer from poor reception when the weather is bad. After reading other reviews, I expected better."
2,CHEAPLY and a WASTE of CHINA recycle metal Wire,"Purchase this antenna mainly for 3 reasons. I live in the suburbs 40 miles from stations. I have no obstructions. The first attraction was the reveiws, second high tech appearence, third was specs. Did not preform as stated, you could make it out of coat hangers. Disappointed with the product. Should of backed off of the idea that it could reach out and pull more channels than my OLD radio shack antenna, well it has not. My opinion would be go to your local store and look at products. save your money"
1,"Very poor quality, spent half the day trying to set it up","I spent half the day trying to set this up, only to find the coax connector was poorly made or poorly soldered to the antenna. Would finally get a halfway decent signal, and then the slightest motion of the cable, or seemingly no motion at all would cause the signal to disappear. Back up the ladder to see what was wrong, and finally figured out that just touching the cable made the signal go in and out. Had several brand new cables, all tested well, and the problem occurred with no matter which of three cables I used. Total piece of garbage, which is where it is now. It had been a long time since I had purchased something this poor, I was not in the habit of keeping boxes. I had already thrown out the box and the recycling had already gone out."
2,This antenna did not work well for my area in Suitland MD,"I bought this antenna after reading a review by someone in Greenbelt. His review was that it worked fine for him. Since I am in the DC area I thought it may work for me here in Suitland. While it did pickup a few stations it missed MOST of the local DC stations like 7 and 9. If you live in this area and want to watch off-the-air TV then get a good roof top antenna for VHF/UHF. I found out that the HDMI broadcasts are on the same frequency bands as the ""regular"" tv. Now that you know, hopefully you won't waste your money on this one."
3,Good to Middling UHF Only Antenna,"Decent build quality, instructions, and packaging, however this antenna fails to receive VHF transmissions unless you live very close to the source. Reading closer into the specifications of this antenna I now realize this is specified as a UHF antenna with no mention VHF optimization. Signal strength was a little better than my previous attic mounted 15$ bunny-ears, but the difference is difficult to discern. In Gilbert AZ which is only 18 miles from south mountain and the transmission of four local VHF stations, and with this attic mounted antenna pointed directly at south mountain I still cannot receive any of the VHF channels with more than 10% signal strength. All other UHF stations show very good signal strength however this is not much of a difference from a set of indoor bunny ears. I do not recommend this antenna if you expect to receive VHF channels, otherwise its a decent UHF solution."
4,Pretty Good Antenna,"We have the antenna just stuck up in the attic, with no attempt at orienting it to the correct direction due to the tight space. It pulls in all the local stations perfectly and is a really big improvement over the basic digital antennas for only a few dollars more. We're about 25 miles from the digital towers, but the antenna was able to pull in a 50 mile signal when I tested it near a window. I've already recommended it to a friend."
5,just works,I set this up in my attic and I now pull in all the local HD singlas I couldnt get before. All the hardware was included and setup was a breeze. Took a bit to tune but once you get it youll be impressed.
5,HDTV ANTENNA,This HDTV antenna more than surpassed my expectations. The clarity is actually better than cable and/or satelite!
5,Like Magic!,"I live in an area with reception issues. Line of sight is interupted by the end of a mountain range. Distance to towers is about 25 miles. Analog is out of the question but once I was ready for digital TV I decided to give it a try. I tried three different antennas. First, the kind that clip onto your satellite dish. Didn't work. Then I tried two different indoor/outdoor amplified types. Did not get ANY digital channels.So I decided to go for a real, mounted type antenna and chose the DB4, based on reviews, specs, size, and cost.It immediately found ALL the digital channels available in my area, just from testing it inside the house! It is mounted outside now, and I receive all channels at high strength ranging from 70% to 89%. I am using about 75ft of cable and a distribution amplifier just before a splitter to two rooms. It works!"
3,Not a miracle as marketed,"I guess we are all somewhat effected by good marketing, having a prior amplified antenna and avg reception, I live at 9,000ft and lots of trees but a reasonable shot towards the broadcast towers some 15+ miles away, I rather expected to pick up all channels when installed off the upper deck. While the existing good reception channels are a little better, the marginal ones now do not show up. I would not classify this as very omi-directional, it still requires movement for some stations.Guess I had too high of hope with something larger and advertised as the ulimate. I have not called the manufacture as can guess the routine that I will here...place higher, get different cable, more amp, etc....I will just live with loss of some channels or put the more compact (Phillips bought at Walmart) back up.Not necessarily unhappy just dissappointed in what I thought this product could do."
4,It's a good deal,Amazon shipping was on top of it and received this short order. Reception has exceeded my expectations. Before my roof-top instillation I gave it a go inside the my house and reception was quite good.
3,mutli-directional?,"I dnt think this is really working for us but couldn't return it as we crossed the 30 day period. We bought this one after reading the review online. We had a terk antenna before. Terk was doing a better job. for the money we spent on this, we are not really getting as many channels as we should."
3,Antenna good for 25 miles with amp.,I had the antenna man professionally install this antenna and he said it's only good for 20 miles. It doesn't pull in all the stations. In time I'll have to buy full antenna. Sorry
4,Works Great,"I installed this antenna in my attic and it works great to pick up HD signals that are 15-40 miles away. Reception is OK for regular tv, better then rabbit ears, but not too much better."
4,Excellent product,"When my old antenna finally bit the dust, I decided to try to find one that could mount in the attic. This one did the trick, although the u-bolt legs need to be about an inch longer to accomodate mounting on a 2x4, since no J-bar is included. I managed to get mine mounted anyway, with a ""friction fit"" on a vertical 2x4 in the attic, and the results have been amazing. I feed mine through the digital tuner on a near-new Panasonic DVD/VCR combo, and all my local digital stations now come through clearly and crisply, including about 8 or 9 feeds that I never got at all before. However, the one local VHF station that has no digital signal remains a bit snowy. I'm about 35 miles from the local towers, and I'd say that for an attic mount, one wouldn't want to be much farther away for analog signals. For digital, who knows? My local digital channels appear to me to be as clear as my satellite feeds."
3,Not bad but better than what I had.,"Had been using a high-end Radio Shack indoor antenna with a built in amp. I mounted the DB4 on my roof and the signal was a bit better. I added a separate 20db amplifier and that helped quite a bit. I did get more channels than I had been getting with the indoor model but, as someone else noted, the picture will start to pixelate seemingly for no reason on clear days. I live in a valley and knew reception would be tough.Still cheaper than cable or satellite."
5,DB4 Antenna,"This is fantastic! Delivery was quick. Little damage on the antenna, but it did not cause any trouble in reception. I live in south west suburb of Chicago. Checked on [...] that I am 30 miles away from most stations and angle was 62 degree.I put the antenna on the garage roof of my single family house, just laid it flat on the roof, approximately towards the direction of the stations. Used about 60 ft of coaxial cable. I could have used less but bought 50ft to be on the safe side, and another 10 ft because I used existing cable from outside the house to the TV. I can watch about 25 channels (because few stations like channel 11 ie, PBS has many channels on HDTV). I have fantastic reception, better than my existing dish network. I know the comparison is not fair, my dish network was not HD. But in anycase I get such nice signal,I am very happy about it."
4,HD antenna,"Easy installation, I had to raise the antenna to get over trees, but reception is very good. Light and easy to use."
2,Can't get all DTV channels if you're in Los Angeles!,"I'm located in Los Angeles, CA. This antenna worked great for a year until the June 12 transition. Problem is this is a UHF ONLY antenna, but in my area channels 7 (ABC), 9 (KCAL), 11 (FOX), and 13 (KCOP) moved their DTV signals back to the VHF range. So if you're in Los Angeles, you WILL NOT receive all DTV channels with this antenna alone. I couldn't watch the last game of the 2009 NBA Finals because of this!! Buyer beware!"
4,Did a good job--,Easy to put together--did not give me a stronger signal that my old UHF-VHF antenna ( may be a little stronger)--BUT gave a larger angle than my Old Antenna--Had to use my rotor on my OLD ANTENNA- all the time-----BUT this new direct DB4-once I got it centered--all my signals came in fine. Shipping was free--and it came in a few days---I am happy---MY wife is VERY Happy with the new antenna---She hated trying to figure out where to point the Old Antenna.
5,Good Digital Antenna,I searched for an outdoor digintal antenna with the following attributes:1) Good quality signals2) Not so big (smaller than typical antenna)3) Easy to install (one person)4) Economical (less than $50)This met my requirements and Amazon got it to me a lot faster than what it told me.Our family is enjoying a high quality digital public TV because of this.
4,works---considering,"I live 60 miles from Nashville and surrounded by hills and trees. I managed to get Ch2 from 50 miles away consistently, the religious stations Ch50 about half the time which is 60 miles away, and once in a while ch4, and ch58 which are 60 miles also. Considering our location and that all I did was plop the antenna in a chair on our side porch, it did very well. Reception was excellent on Ch2. But I think I might upgrade to a db8 for more power, and try to capture more Nashville stations."
2,HD Antenna,The antenna is advertised as an HD Antenna. It is an UHF antenna. It will work great if the station you are trying to receive is transmitting on UHF. I live in the Scottsdale Arizona. My favorite station happens to transmit on the upper VHF band. Not surprising I cannot receive it with this antenna.I should have done my homework. First I should have checked what frequency the stations in the Phoenix area transmit on. That was where I made my mistake. I know what a UHF and VHF antenna look like. It is a good UHF antenna. It is just the discription is misleading.
4,Delivers as promised...,"I live in a rural area and had constant issues with my rabbit ears after the digital switch happened. So I bought this unit, placed it outside on the edge of my roof and it works well. I use a standard cable inside my home with a signal booster. I get 8 channels most days when I got maybe 5 with the rabbit ears before, after a whole lot of frustration move the ears around my living room."
4,Good Antenna,"I'm in Palo Alto,CA (about 38 miles south of San Francisco),and I bought this on the advice of a co-worker to prepare for the digital transition. I was looking for something to install in the attic. At first the results weren't good,but after moving the antenna as far as I could towards the front of the house, the results were pretty good (there is a 2-story house next door to my 1-story house, and it is in the path of where I needed to aim my antenna). I now get all the stations broadcasting from Sutro Tower except for channel 7. Inexplicably channel 7 went from UHF (this antenna is UHF only) to VHF some months after the transition date. I can receive about 70 channels (if you include the sub-channels). For cheap people (like me), I also built the ""coat-hanger"" antenna found in You-tube. It looks very much like the DB4 but without the reflectors, and it works almost as well. I have 2 TVs; one runs off the DB4 and one off the ""coat hanger"" antenna."
4,work properly,there are different antennas on market but this one looked fancy and claim its HD. so far we dont have much HD over the air and my TV is pretty old but antena works and this is what counts. its not multidirectional as you may expect but okay anyway and grab signal as far as 50 miles.
4,Good reception,"If you do not have cable or satellite, this antenna will pick up a lot of local channels near you. We set it up in the attic of our 1 story house and it served its purpose. The only thing is that you will need to buy a stand; we used a left over post from our fence and it worked just fine. You will also need to get a splitter if you have more than one TV."
3,quad tv mast,claims to be capable of picking up signal from 60 miles. We are located ~40 miles and the signal must beamplified for HDTV stations to be received.
1,Piece of junk. DON'T BUY IT,"This antenna is junk. I am less than 20 miles from the station antenna farms and am unable to get consistent signal. I am using an old style antenna on one TV and this one on another. The old style antenna works much better on the entire selection of stations available.I would return this but it is past the allowable return date. SO, I'm stuck with it."
2,Disappointing performance,"I live in central NJ 50 miles south-west of NYC and bought the DB4 expecting that it would improve the UHF reception I had previously gotten from an old, attic-mounted, Radio Shack VU-110XR. Surprisingly the DB4 performs significantly worse than the VU-110XR in UHF reception. With a Channel Master amplifier CM7777 installed the VU-110XR was able to pull in nearly two to three times as many DTV channels as the DB4. So for now I am feeding the TV off the amplified signal from the VU-110XR for both UHF & VHF. I regret that I did not first buy and try the CM7777 rather than the DB4."
2,Didnt really work for me,"I bought it after reading a lot of reviews, but it has been sitting in my garage ever since. Didnt really do anything for me. I ended up buying a wineguard indoor antenna and I have it in my closet on top of a cabinet paired with an amp that is connected to a 8 way splitter - and that one feeds on the air channels to all my TVs.I live in the susburbs of north dallas, and this is the wineguard model that has worked really worked for me.Winegard SS-3000 Amplified Indoor UHF/VHF Antenna"
1,This Thing Didn't Work for Me,"I tried this antenna in Dallas where there are multiple local stations, although most of the network stations have their antennas and transmitters about 40 miles away, and always have.If the truth be known, the antenna wouldn't work at all without the amplifier. With it connected, it worked but was frequently unreliable. Even then, it had to be on the roof...would not work at all in the attic.I pitched it after about 3 months, bought another brand for less money and it works perfectly.Other reviewers have found it to work as advertised. So my suggestion is this: If you buy it and it doesn't work right away, send it back for a refund. Circumstances are not going to change with time."
2,not that good,"I've used this antenna in Orange County, CA. The signal reception strength is weak. I would not recommend this product if you are not close to the original signal tower. It's just ok."
5,Ditched expensive Cable - Got an antenna,"Got rid of expensive Cable and bought an antenna.Required additional purchases to convert to digitalbut, one-time cost was not that much. Reception onall three TVs in home are great!"
5,Awesome,"I bought this for my parents in NYC who refuse to get cable or satellite tv. With a standard antenna that was over 10 ft wide, they barely received 3 channels on the new digital broadcasting. With this new compact antenna, they now receive virtually all the free HD and analog channels in the area; That's like four channels for each of the major stations and many more. It was very easy to put up and connect. It was so good, one of their neighbors asked me to buy them one as well."
3,Its ok,"Expected a little better by the reviews. Does ok, but the one I have from Radio Shack is better. Alright for the price."
5,No more Cable !!!,"It took about a year before I actually put it up. It's in my backyard on a 4x4 that's about 10 feet high. I wasn't aware that an antenna could show you all of these crystal clear channels. I'm watching the same things that i was watching on cable. For the one time price of the DB4. Unbelievable. Of course i have a digital ready TV. After scanning the channels, I was ready to go.A money saver too!"
3,Expected more,"This is an ok antenna. It works well. I have it placed in the attic, I thought it would get more channels but it is still not a bad purchase. Can't beat no more cable bills. Just make sure you are not using splitters and if you do use the signal amplifiers."
2,db4 antenna review,Wanted to watch the Olympics on Wesh Channel 2 in Ocoee. My rabbit ears got better reception than the DB4. I was able to pick up quite a few other channels I couldn't pick up on my normal rabbit ears with the DB4 however. Didn't think it was worth the price and returned it. Great shipping and service though Amazon.com.
1,Not as good as homemade,"I bought this to replace a homemade antenna, as found on YouTube. The YouTube antenna received 10 channels and this only picked up 2. Not worth it, if copper wire screwed to a board works better."
2,"NOT a ""multi directional"" antenna","So, despite being advertised as Multi Directional, this antenna is most definately NOT. It is a VERY good OMNI directional antenna though. I have two signals from two towers which are ALMOST in opposite directions. This antenna needed to be trained EXACTLY at the towers to pick up the signal. The towers are 11 and 5 miles away, so power and distance are not an issue. I was using it on the roof, and had clear sight of both towers."
3,Not good for VHF (channels of 13 or lower),"Clearly this antenna works best for UHF channels, Ultra High Frequency channels, those with the higher numbers. I did not realize this when I purchased it so was disappointed when tried using it for lower channels like 8 and 10. In all fairness it does say ""Strong performance across UHF spectrum (Channels 14-69)"" but I assumed it would work well for Channels 2-13. It does not. In fact it worked no better than inside ""rabbit ears"" for VHF. If you are looking to receive VHF look elsewhere. I suggest theChannel Master CM 4228 8-bay HDTV/UHF Antenna CM4228HD"
3,"Pretty good, but cheesy","The jokes are cheesy, but the designs and puppeteering are really good, and If you're interested in that stuff, this is for you. As far as special features go, there are two versions of Tell Tale Heart. One is a little over thirty minutes (somewhat gorey, not scary though), and the other is like twenty-seven or so minutes, and is edited from some of the gore (which there never is a lot of). There is also a documentary about creating the Puphedz, and the people behind them."
5,Dance puppets dance!,"Puppets act out Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale HeartThis is a wonderfully dark and twisted, not to mention 'punny,' version of the classic tale. The puppets and effects were phenomenal given the budget. The voices behind the puppets could have been improved, but all in all this is a delicious little film.More Puphedz please!!!"
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Basic concept of book is that 'quality cannot be inspected in, it must be build in'. I did come away with some new ideas and some interesting points. However, I frequently found the book to be off the main theme."
3,Another Mediocre Sequel?,"While no where near as good as ""A Woman of Substance"" it is still worth watching. If you fell in love with Emma Harte how can you not watch the second part of the story? The best character of the movie is of course Jenny Seagrove.I'd love that they cast er as the star in this one too. Why have I never seen her star in another movie? She is just excellent as in ""Substance."" Stephen Collins is a great lead but the chemistry is pretty low between them. The worst part of the entire story is Paula marrying a Fairley? I honestly couldnt stomach that one after seeing them try to ruin Emma a generation before. The best part? Emma & Blackey O""Neill FINALLY declare their love."
5,"Excellent mini-series, well done, with good acting.","Unlike current movies, there is no vulgar language. This was obviously an expensive production that was well acted. The material was mature since there were a number of affairs."
3,Barbara Taylor Bradford's. Hold the Dream,"I really don't care for this type of story line even though I watched it. Too shallow!!!Grant it, it was filmed in the eighties. Way to impossible."
5,arbara Taylor Bradford's Hold That Dream,"I love Debra Kerr .in Hold that dream. B T Bradford is a great novelist. I saw this years ago, it is timeless."
4,May we always dream,This was the movies made after the Woman of Substances and they did a great job. I like older movies.
3,The first part to this saga was much better.,"The first part of the saga was much better. I only watched this one to finish the story, but overall it lacked depth and was just a soap."
2,Okay,"Not as good as part one. The first part is interesting, but the acting of all except the main character in part two is lacking."
3,For hardcore fans only,This comes with three items1. a music CD which is excellent and spans 40 years of studio one's history2. a home movie of Coxsone Dodd and the main men of studio one. The footage of King Stitt in a bit hard to take as one struggles to discern what he's saying.3. a 100 Page booklet of which is super cool. Photos from the 60s that you won't see anywhere else and a good overview of Studio One's history.I'd say that you'd better be an absolute fan of studio one to feel that you've got your money's worth.
2,Item not as pictured; Poor customer service from this seller.,"I ordered this costume for my daughter (10)for Halloween. She had seen it online and was soooooo excited to be a Gothic High Prom Queen. However, when the costume came the sash said ""Hell High Prom Queen"" instead of Gothic High. I could not believe they would send this instead & I was not going to let my daughter go out trick-or-treating in something as rude as that! I ended up making a new sash myself for her to wear with it. When I emailed the seller several times about whether or not they had any with the correct sash for a replacement, I didn't even get a reply. I would never consider ordering from this seller again."
5,Strategic Negotiation,"As a marketing student at the University of San Diego, we are studying business negotiation. While reviewing different texts on negotiation I came across this book and was blown away by his introduction (the story of a lone Roman Senator ""negotiating"" the halt of a Syrian King and an army of 30,000 Syrian soldiers). This book resonates with common sense and practicality.Incredible historical references drive points home and provide gripping examples of master negotiation.Altogether, by far the best book on negotiation I've come across."
3,cardiosport Go Heart Rate Monitor,The Cardiosport Go Heart Rate Monitor is the only heart rate monitor I could find at a reasonable price that would show me my resting heart rate (while sleeping).The Go button is very difficult requiring many hard presses to Go. The chest strap is very rigid and will not maintain contact with the chest unless you lie perfectly still on your back. If you turn on your side it will lose contact with your chest and shut down.
1,Bad Purchase,"I should have known better. I have had three of these over the last 10 years, bought one for my wife and another for me after the transmitter failed. I saw this one on Amazon and thought I would get another before they are all gone. But this one was in a package that was not sealed and the transmitter was DOA. Too much trouble to send back. Live and Learn."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","Originally I purchased a K 3.86, After less than 15 hours it started ""surging"", on and off and very little pressure. Like an idiot I purchased the K 2.26M (this was going to be better). After less than 5 hours of operation it started ""surging"" on and off, very little pressure. I even disassembled the first unit, down to the pistons, no obvious problems. Put it back together and it does the same thing. Time to end my misery, throw them in the garbage and buy a pressure washer that works. Don't feel like wasting another hour to find a problem that was put there by China. What was I thinking anyway?"
1,Karcher Pressure Washer,"DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM KARCHER!!! This was a real piece of junk and it ended up in the trash bin tonight. I've had it for a while but haven't put that much time on it primarily because I found I can do just about as good a job with a garden hose, a good nozzle, a brush and a small amount of elbow grease!! A friend has a pressure washer by RIGID...a more expensive but much better solution."
1,Garbage,"Within 30 minutes of use, the high pressure hose to the wand blew off the outlet on the compressor. You could see the (plastic) threads in the sleeve on the hose attached to the gun were stripped. Bought a replacement (Powercare) gun with metal threads at the end of its hose. Used it for 20 minutes, when the hose again blew off the compressor. This is an awful product."
1,Avoid at any cost!!!,"I owned a 12-year old Karcher 1800 psi power washer that worked magnificently until last year. It was a well-constructed and sturdy machine that took on all sorts of jobs with competence and reliability. After it finally died, I went ahead and bought this Karcher model, thinking that it would be as well-built as my old one since it bears the same brand name. Boy, was I wrong!First of all, this model was cheaply made. Very light weight, all the hose connections seemed to wiggle. I turned the on/off switch and the knob literally broke off from the switch. I called the 800 number and they sent a replacement. The replacement worked, albeit very loudly, for about 20 minutes and quit. Although the motor was still running, no water was coming out. I let it cool off for an hour and tried again with the same result.When it did work, for those 20 minutes it worked fairly well. But this poorly designed and made model is one to avoid."
1,Complete Junk,"If I could give this product minus stars I would. We bought a Karcher pressure washer from Lowes a couple of years ago. We used it probably 3 times. Just as it was out of warranty, it quit completely. We needed a washer and bought a more expensive Karcher from Costco. Costco usually doesn't sell junk. We used it a couple of times last year. Today we started using it and it totally quit again. Karcher products are for you if you want something disposable that you don't have to worry about storing! If I divide the cost by number of uses, it adds up to about $50 a use. I could rent one and pay less. I will never buy another Karcher product."
1,I hate this product,"I bought a Karcher 2.26 pressure washer 3 years ago. Have used it 3 times and every time had to wrestle to get it going and keep it going, which took longer than the job. Karcher ""support services"" weren't any help. I would give it -10 stars if that was an option."
1,"2nd pressure washer, 2nd failure","We bought one of these, it failed. Returned it, and the replacement failed after the first job. Plastic parts in critical high pressure areas is a design failure. DO NOT BUY ONE of these."
2,Pésima,"Esta hidrolavadora es de pésima calidad. Es pequeña, parece de juguete. A la tercera vez que se usó se dañó. No la recomiendo para nada."
1,Driver,"What a piece of garbage. I may as well have taken that C-Note and thrown it in the street...Don't waste your money....This is the second one purchased for our use and the same problem occured, seal failure on the pump, there-by causing a pressure loss...Regards"
5,My Third Karcher,This is my third Kartcher. My first one was stolen so it must be of value. My second one last 12 years. This is my third unit.Great value for a very light weight yet powerful unit.Still no thought for a place to wind up the power cord.I highly recommend this unit.
1,Company won't honor warranty,"I bought one of these a year ago. The high-pressure outlet that the wand attaches to is made of plastic and turns at a 90-degree angle to exit the case. After a year of service the unit started spraying water inside the case. The right-angle plastic piece had developed a crack right at its weakest point. This is a very bad design mistake on their part.The unit was 1 year + 1 day old at the time. I called Karcher to take advantage of their ""Rapid Exchange"" program and they would not honor their warranty because my unit was 1 day past its warranty period!!And to add insult to injury, it took them a week to make that decision and they didn't even have the courtesy to call me and tell me. I had to call them and pry the information out of them.I will never purchase anything from this company again."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Purchased this product in 2006 and was never very impressed with its performance. Should have returned it then. Pressure was minimal, only about enough to clean up lawn furniture. Forget about trying to clean a deck with it. Then this year, when we went to use the machine, there was no pressure at all; the garden hose had more pressure. Less than a month beyond warranty, the company refused to be of any assistance other than telling us we could ship it to a service center to have it reparied."
1,Great Product....For about ten (10) hours,"Truly disappointing product and customer service just as bad. I bought it new Sept '06, used it 8-10 hours max, stored it indoors. When I hooked it up on Oct 8th '07 it worked about 5 minutes before water began gushing from the switch area and motor kept running with wand turned off.Naturally, the warranty expired 34 DAYS ago (I had registered it online). After being bounced around to 4 different reps on the Karcher Toll free line with no help at all, I surrendered and quit trying. Oh....by the way: don't bother trying to email Karcher. There is no listing for email contact available on their website.This was my second Karcher. The first died also but it was a smaller unit and I hadn't registered it so never tried to get any help.I give this product ONE star only because there is no way to rate it even lower."
1,Absolute trash,Bought this 2 yrs ago at Lowes. Worked well the first year. It has always been stored inside. Last year it started Cycling on and off on it's own. Now it does it constantly. Called tech service and got some bonehead in India or Wherever. I have torn it down and found it has a bad dump valve. Try to get one !!!!!!! I will never never never buy this Made in Italy piece of junk again .Worse company ever. Spend your money on a cheap Chinese model at Harbor Freight.
4,Great,"Might be a wee bit conservative for some, but it addresses the issues in a clear, lucid manner."
1,It was twisted and looks like dried after wet,It is very twisted and wrinkled. It looks like dried after wet. So hard to read and use.It is awful.
1,No intelligence here,"Siders does not understand that Westerners are in no responsible for the failure of the poor. On the contrary the more you give to them, the greater the problems will become as they will multiply. The only real hope for them is a change of attitude (compare Japan Africa, although Japan has no material resources unlike Africa.) Besides people in far countries are not ""neighbors"". I really hated this book."
4,Great insight,"I had to purchase this book for a class that I am in right now, but found it to have great content. There are a lot of facts and data about how much each continent/region gives to world causes, and has provides clear information so that you can form your own opinion. It is definitely interesting if you are using it for school or also as a resource for any type of project on this subject matter."
2,"Bad hooks and boring songs, Image is Everything is better","I'm not a huge fan of Jugheads, but have heard most of their albums. This one stinks. Bought this figuring it was going to be like Image is Everything, nice catchy strong hooks, and amping music but it is not. Not enough voice doubling, with out it the singer can't sing. Buy at the risk of falling asleep!"
4,Hacker uses brilliant prose to animate statistics.,"While Hacker uses statistics to illustrate the divide between black and white America, his book is anything but dry. Furthermore, while Hacker is an academic, he avoids the text book type of writing that many academics are known for. Two Nations is interesting, provocative and should be required reading in any class that attempts to address the problems of race in America. Although Hacker's book doesn't provide any solutions, he doesn't proport to. He is truly the foremost writer on race in America. Read Two Nations and find out why."
4,Well balanced study of race,"I'm amazed at some of my fellow reviewers. Hacker pickes on whites? Sucks up to blacks? Hardly.I read the book some years ago and was very impressed. Hacker's use of statistics cuts through a lot of the rhetoric that surround the issue of race in America. I don't agree with all his conclusions--on the topic of race, none of us agree on every point--but he makes some very good points. My only complaint, actually, is the analysis is a bit light. I would have liked to see him draw some more conclusions. Still, if you want a statistical overview of race, linked with some good commentary, here's a place to start.Oh, and I suppose I should mention I'm a white guy. Not a self-hating white guy, just a white guy. And I didn't and don't feel picked on by Hacker's book."
3,a misconception,"I must admit that Hackers examination of the racial problem in America was eye-opening, but alot of the lines in the book turned me off. One of the biggest turn-offs was when he said that an African-American cannot be racist. His only reasoning is that since African-Americans are oppressed, it is impossible for them to be racist against whites.That was not the only turn-off, but there are too many to go into. However, it was a well thought out piece of writing and it did open my eyes to many of the problems faced by African-Americans in the U.S."
2,This book was sometimes interesting but,"the plethora of percentages and numbers weigh it down. The views of the author were one sided and sometimes a little biased agaisnt the majority. This is a small quibble and does not really take away from the main message the author is trying to convey. This book is, however, quite an eye opener especially for those who believe that in this country all men are created equal. This book proves that it simply isn't so."
2,What the heck?,"In WWIII: Warshot, the Reagan was sunk! Along with it's crew! How the did they suddenly ressurect themselves? I dislike this book for that one reason. Everything else is fine. END"
4,Serves the purpose,We go thru two of these per crew every year. Landscapers are hard on these things and tend to break at least once every season. Average user would probably not see as much breakage or need to replace as often as we do!
4,Les Girls,"Any movie in which Gene Kelly appears always proves to be entertaining. ""Les Girls"" is no exception."
2,FOR JACK COLE'S WORK...ONLY !,"There is only one good reason to watch ""Les Girls"" and that is to see what Jack Cole's choreography looked like. Cole was respected, loved and feared by scores of Broadway and Hollywood dancers but no one seems to write or speak about him today. Well, here's your chance to see some of his most iconic choreography...especially noteworth is the title number. What DIDN'T I like about the film?The dull plot (did someone at M.G.M. really believe a musical of the ""Rashoman"" tale was a good idea?); the totally unbelievable dialogue; the fact that Gene Kelly looks too old for any of his gorgeous, sexy leading ladies; the director, brilliant George Cukor, is simply not at home helming a musical and lastly, the fact that the leading man, as written, is a boor....even Gene Kelly, certainly one of the most charming performers in movies, cannot make him palatable."
2,Best forgotten,"This is one of the weakest musicals ever produced by MGM, leagues away from, say, American in Paris and Brigadoon. Gene Kelly, looking (oh, that wig) more like the dancers' father than lover, is saddled with a weak script that has him bickering, snarling, and bossing people about throughout the film. The girls in the story seem to be miscast, Kendall and Elg especially, and their lines are usually sappy in the extreme. The Cole Porter music is VERY minor and mostly embarrassing. The costumes are good, and the dancing is passable. All in all, this is a waste of time and money. An MGM musical that is best forgotten."
2,could ANYBODY resist a taina elg musical?,"george cukor only ventured into musicals on rare occasions. two of those (""a star is born"" and ""my fair lady"") are classics; ""les girls"" is assuredly not. this was gene kellys last mgm musical, and cole porters penultimate score of any kind, and neither master is at his peak; as a matter of fact theyre both pretty close to their nadirs. kellys attempt at parodying marlon brando in ""the wild one"" (already a passe reference by the time this was filmed) is downright embarrassing, and the supporting ""girls"" (when mitzi gaynor is the biggest star among them) just kinda sit there like a lump. if thats entertainment ..."
1,Dont be deceived,"I thought this would be a fun. light evening - something to take my mind off my troubles - I am on ublic assistance so it is very hard to scrape together the money to rent a movie - I had free passes from Chirstmas so I go this with those. I remeber loviing to dance when I was a litle girl - I tapped and did some jazz dancing - nothing like these ladies - who do almost nude dancing in this ""family"" film. This story was about EMOTIONAL ABUSE - women suffering becasue some man has treated them like garbage. I was abused my whole liffe until one day I took a walk to a store (my husband had hidden the keys from me - I looked for them but at the time I was drugging - hooked on meth) and found a book on emotional abuse that changed my life. They shoudl remake this movie and the women should get revenge on the men for all the abuse. No one will ever hurt me again."
4,"""Rashomon"" with music and beauties, energized by Kay Kendall","As several other reviewers have commented, this film, Gene Kelly's last musical with MGM, borrows its central conceit from Akira Kurosawa's immortal ""Rashomon"" - only this time, the central event isn't a murder, but a tangled love affair involving a song-and-dance man (Kelly) and his three gorgeous backups (Kendall, Mitzi Gaynor and Taina Elg) which becomes the subject of a media-magnet London lawsuit. The lovely, much-lamented Kendall's performance is the core of this movie (her drunken-opera scene is not to be missed!) but Elg, Gaynor and Kelly all turn in highly creditable work as well."
1,What a disappoinment,I have owned this blender for 6 months. I have used it to blend diet drinks and milkshakes. I used it today to make a thick milkshake and it died on me. I have bought much cheaper blenders in the past and they have outlasted this blender by far. I plan to stick with the cheaper blenders from now on.
3,blender,"researched for the best blender for the money before i bought this...well made, works good and looks good but it is SOOO LOUD that i avoid using it unless i absolutely have to!"
1,IgoUgo Travel Report: Mazatlan : The Inside Scoop from Experienced Travelers,This is an unnecessary purchase. You can go to IgoUgo.com and search Mazatlan to get the very same information word for word.
1,DVD Bad,"In my set, the DVD was corrupted and would not play on any player in my house or in my computer. A shame as I was looking forward to the video. Since the DVD obviously worked for others, this must be a QC problem."
4,Crazy Penis - The Wicked Is Music,"The Wicked Is Music, Crazy Penis' second album, starts with the dreamy ""There's A Better Place,"" which samples from film Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It's a nifty start, though the rest of the album doesn't always reach the same level. ""You Started Something"" and ""Keep On,"" although a perfectly decent house tracks, are both somewhat generic. ""You Are We,"" however, has personality to spare; it's uplifting and full of good feeling. One of the best tracks on the album. The quality of the house on The Wicked Is Music is still high, don't get me wrong, but perhaps they could have made the individual tracks more distinctive -- A Nice Hot Bath With... certainly had that going for it."
2,A little dissapointed...,"I was pretty disappointed with this purchase. I was expecting more, and went against everything I knew as holy by buying this on a whim after hearing a REALLY good track from another album of theirs (3 play it cool). There are some vocals on this album that really get in the way of what could have been great music. Boo..."
4,NEW PROGRESSIVE METAL AT IT'S BEST,THESE ITALIAN PROG ROCKERS ARE ONE OF THE FEW EXAMPLES OF TRUE TALENT IN THE WASTE LAND OF CRAP THAT IS MUCH OF TODAYS MUSIC. THE PLAYING AND SONG WRITTING ARE BOTH TOP NOTCH.
3,Save your money - youtube has better than this,"This drum video was of an international rudiment champion. He can play the rudiments, no question. It's good to have something you can easily go to in order to see the rudiments pulled off correctly. The video does that, so I can't really go below three stars. But, this video is not really DVD-quality. Plus, this guy is kind of a tool in the way he presents his drumsticks before and after each rudiment. There's also no real explanation of how to actually execute the rudiment, or how you'd use a rudiment in actual playing (like using paradiddles in order to switch hands on the downbeat). He just pulls out his sticks like some twitchy robot, launches into the rudiment and puts his sticks back like a twitchy robot.Bottom line...save your money. The rudiment clips on youtube are just as good, if not better."
4,Incredibly funky!,I could not believe this CD. I bought it for one song originally and realized that the whole cd is absolutely incredible! I listen to it whenever I get the chance.
3,Mobile Rack,"Nice rack but the fan went after 2 months, happened to have another fan available to replace the one in this unit."
2,Close but no Ceegar!,"This is the second rack purchased from Kingwin and I am disappointed. The tiny fan is way too noisy, and the system is not swappable without turning off the computer, even though it has a key to turn off power and unlock the tray.With external drives in general, all you need to do is either use the Safe remove in the oS or simly unplug the power. The drive stops and the reference in My Computer disappears. But with the Kingwin, using the key to turn off power does not provide this functionality. In fact, if you do so, you must reboot anyway, and it will involve a hard reboot, as the OS is stuck looking for this drive in an endless loop for reboot. You can go ahead and pull the drive, it is shut off, but the icon for it does not disappear from Computer, as does externals do.I'll likely look for a true hot swappable enclosure.Win 7 64 bit, AMD system 12G memory."
3,Loud fan noise on two units after less than two months,"I purchased two of these HDD enclosures less than two months ago. As far as initial quality, they are certainly fine...After a month, one of them started to make a tremendously obnoxious whining sound - I soon came to realize that it was the fan on the back of the enclosure.Less than a month later, the other enclosure started doing the same exact thing.The fans are easy enough and cheap enough to replace, but I'd think they could do better than two months..."
4,Great Stuff,"These are lovely and haunting selections....some new, some very old. I received it as a Christmas gift and had never heard much Andean music and didn't know much about these musicians but it is really wonderful and I find myself listening to it again and again. It is an interesting combination of wooden pan flutes, strings and percussion....give it a listen..."
3,Inkhay,"Excellent collection of andean music. While all other Amazon customer reviews single out Pepe Santana who is responsible for the wind instruments and some of the rhythm I would like to pay tribute to Atahualpa Poalasin whose harp playing on this album is phenomenal. Note that other recordings by this fine artist are also available from Amazon and others but not under the name ""Inkhay"" but rather his own name. Be advised that the first name ""Atahualpa"" is somewhat common among latin american recording artists so be sure you are ordering the works of the harpist and not the guitarist etc."
5,"great , pepe santana is out of sight",great fan of pepe santana and ish i could have an idea hen and where he will be performing if anyone could help i would appreciate it
1,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"There are no out of screen effects. The in-screen 3D is consistently underwhelming. The content is also bad.This is a side-by-side DVD, playable on the new 3D TVs.To sum up the content; this is a scene of a whale in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse. Here is the next scene, in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse...in forward...in reverse. The next scene, in forward...in reverse.....You get the idea.In the fireworks portion, each explosion on the screen is doubled, tripled or quadrupled at varying sizes and locations. At the same time some are shown in reverse. What you see is a headache inducing big mess on the screen. This title doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating.*** Keep Clear Of This One ***MY 3D RATING = POOR (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
2,"wash, rinse, repeat","Seemed like the same footage repeated over and over. Same whale, same tail. Couldn't watch in its entirety. Maybe it's just me...."
1,Terrible,This video consists entirely of Looped footage of just two sceens. It's poorly processed so the 3D imaging will probably give you a headache as it did for me.
2,Never really got going,"I didn't enjoy this book. The story line never really got going and I could always tell what was going to happen next.In a nutshell, it's about a single 30-something career girl that needs a date for her upcoming school reunion. Predictably, she bumbles through a series of almost relationships in search for the perfect man to have by her side. There is also a somewhat random side-plot involving her not-so-happily married best friend that I don't think adds much to the story except padding.I have also read Marisa Mackle's ""The Mile High Guy"" which I preferred."
4,Loved it!!!,"I am a UK amazon customer and have started copying my reviews onto here to help support the indies/less well known authors. Here's what I said on amazon.co.uk:I am a big fan of this genre and I am pleased to say I think I've found another gem of an author to add to my 'favourite chick lit author' list. I'd never heard of this author until she was recommended to me and I was reluctant to buy at first in case this was just another so-so chick lit read. I'm pleased to say I enjoyed this book very much- the plot was engaging and the characters were very likeable. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I downloaded another two books by this author onto my kindle immediately after finishing this. A perfect beach read!"
2,Eh...,I really did not enjoy this book. Maybe it's just not my style but I was pretty bored the whole way through it. It never really had any momentum.
2,Confusing,"The story line is fine, but I had trouble with the flow of characters speaking. The dialogue would change without saying who was speaking. The e-book format was off too."
1,Not What I Was Led To Believe,"The reviews said this was a romantic comedy. Well she does have sec but half way through I still don't see the romance. All there's been is a woman bitching about the lack of a man in her life, and her job. This sad little book will be deleted."
1,Awful characters,"A woman who just turned 30 searches for a Mr. Right to escort her to a party hosted by a highschool tormentor.Yet another chick lit tale featuring underemployed, unlikable women desperate for men and bouncing from one bed to another. I finished the sample and had no interest in reading the rest of the book."
2,"Mr Right is too choppy, too predictable, too outrageous","SPOILERSI agree with other posters who have commented the kindle version is poorly formatted.I found myself often getting confused with the author's style. Anna would be in conversation with a potential date, and then the next paragraph she would be retelling the story to a confidante.Predictable - was there anyone who didn't know she wasn't going to end up with the most desireable man of all - Mark? And hang on to her upswinging career despite not really indicating any crises or decisions she had made that would justify her getting being promoted to her own store in LONDON. That was predictable and contrived at the same time!And outgrageous - that Darren was Adrian? Not even in the same city! Give me a break. Adrian was often photographed with Victoria...to have a secret life and meet his wife's nemesis at the same time?Like many of her countrywomen, the author does have talent. I will read more of her work."
3,It was almost great.,"The book started off great. It really did begin to drag near the end. I wasn't happy that it went on and on, but then skimped on the ending. I would have liked more time at the end or an epilogue with Mark-a couple page ending wasn't enough."
1,dissapointed,I have to say this book took forever for me to finish. This book is quite possibly one of the worst books I have read in a very long time. The ending? Really? Ugh... total waste of time not to mention money not that I paid much thankfully!
1,finally just read the last five pages to finish it,"I have a strict rule; you start a book, you read a book until the end. I just broke it. I was, according to my kindle, 57% way through the book, and I was so done. I don't like the main character, who sleeps her way through one idiot after the next, i don't like the best friend, who is having marital problems and being an idiot about it, so i give up. The idea was great, the actual story....not so much."
2,Not so right for my night,Struggled to finish this one. Humour might have been lost in translation but suspect sadly not. A great title but the filler between the covers left a bit to be desired.
4,Finally found it!!,"I have searched for this cd for a very long time. I found the album at a garage sale, but the sound is just not quite the same. The music on this CD takes me way back and is so mellow for those of us who spend Christmas alone year after year. It will put you in the highest spirited mood. I can't wait to receive my CD so I will have it for next year."
3,Music for holiday spirit,"Seeing the Jets perform was my first concert experience ever. Ever since I was a child, I have loved their Christmas album. And while the music is dated, very 80's, it's not Christmastime unless I listen to the Jet's music. It's a tape of fun, lively songs and the sweet ""Christmas in My Heart"" make it Christmas for me."
4,Absolutely great!!! The best of the best!,Turely the world's greatest bass player. Jaco had what bass players dream of. He is my inspiration as a bassist. His music is timeless as well as the messages portrayed in his songs. Truely a monumental musician in the history of mondern music.
2,Arrangements and motifs hurt the ear....,I found it hard to enjoy - I miss melody and don't care for strange arrangements and jazz motifs.
5,probably his best studio performance,"Jaco at his best. Not only are his bass riffs both stunning and complex, but his awareness of the rhythmical intracacies and orchestral arangements is phenomenal."
4,Not just for bass players,"Word of Mouth is a collection of inventive, creative tunes and arrangements performed by a diverse collection of talented musicians. It runs the gamut of emotions, from the frenetic to the sublime. The music is always leading us somewhere, never content to stagnate. This is music that you should sit down and listen to, definitely not background music. This is the unique work of a gifted musician and composer.Oh yeah, and he can play bass too.This album is about Jaco Pastorius as a composer and a musician. While he does take a few moments to dazzle us with his virtuosity on the electric bass, what really captivates is the sweep of this entire album as a complete work. His bass playing is everywhere, contributing significantly to the musical whole, but is always subservient to the musical task at hand.This album is not just for bass players. This is a real gem. Go get it!"
2,"Caveat re: ""Three Views of a Secret""","This is not the same track that appeared on the original album. That was a lushly orchestrated studio recording, available only as part of The Essential Jaco Pastorius album.The one that's sold here is a live performance that, while pleasant, does not measure up to the original.Please make the original track available here as an option, Amazon."
3,Honest although not very entertaining,The Making of a Surgeon in the 21st Century is an honest account of the challenges and satisfaction that many surgeons-in-training could relate to. He explains what surgeons go through in easy to understand language and probably it would be a worthwhile read for the families of surgeons-in-training to give them insight and understanding of the process. Dr Miller is not a particularly entertaining writer - certainly not in the same league as Atul Gawande - but that is possibly one of the things that make the experiences seem more genuine.
5,The Making of a Surgeon in the 21st Century,"I agree........this book was very factual and intertaining at the same time. I liked his style of writing and felt like he was right beside me, speaking about his experiences. I cheered in the end. The brutal years that he went through in his training came to a perfect end with the roast! He finally got ""his day""!"
3,just...ok,"Compared to other ""surgical"" based books, this one did'nt have the kick in it. When compared to Gawande's Complications or Vertosick's When Air Hits Your Brain, this ones not even close. Not worth the time or ur cash"
2,Good for the price,"I was teaching the ""English Romantics"" to a small class of students. I needed something cheap. This did the job although it has no footnotes or annotations to the text. Introduction to each poet is helpful but limited in scope.Bill Kurry"
2,An Awfully Awful Adventure,"This dark and dreary book set in post war Liverpool(mid-50s) is really drawn out and confusing. The story is that of Stella, a sixteen year old actress, as she learns the hard way where acting stops and reality begins. She chases the director, and in trying to get his love, romances an aging actor who turns out to be her father. Tha characters are poorly developed past names, except for Stella, but she unfortunately, is hard to follow. She doesn't act normally, and the reader is left to puzzle over her. Near the end of the novel, we find that she was abandoned by her mother as a baby and is left with the deep physcoloical scars. This book loses the reader on page one, making it hard for the reader to want to fumble through it."
2,Not really worth it,"yes, this is a Very Good Book. it fulfills all the requirements of a Very Good Book, being tastefully short, having several flawed characters and one slightly ridiculous and sad main character. It might even be a Classic Good Book. But it isn't fun to read. It's dry, and sanctimonious, and you can't even bring yourself to be shocked at the dissapointing end, or to even care about the characters. Yes, it's very intellectual, but it isn't exciting, interesting, or even a little fun. Really very dissapointing."
5,The Great American Songbook,If you like music you will love The Great American Songbook. It is the history of American popular music in MUSIC!!
1,Not Worth The Money,Most of the songs are cut off and/or talked over by Mike. Fire the editor on this one . I wish I could find the cuts and paste them back. Nice try but no cigar.
5,"buy, buy, buy!!!","Wonderful, I wish there would be more DVDs like this!Mr Feinstein's commentary is a delight, you just wish for more! I hope this is just the beginning of a series for Mr Feinstein since there aren't many people who know this much about music background.....Mr Feinstein, I'm waiting!"
5,beautiful music,"What a wonderful way to spend a leisurely Sunday with my husband! Brought back a few memories but I recommend this to anyone - old or young - if you like ""real"" music! Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this DVD."
5,Great American Songbook,"This was a wonderful trip down memory land with some of the best known songs and the preformers who made it Great. From Lena Horn to Judy Garland, Fred Astar, Gene Kelly, Frank Sanatra, and more this show is packed with clips of your favoriate songs. Kate Smith and God Bless America, Judy Garland and On the Atchicison & Topka and Santa Fay, Fred Astar dancing to putting on the Ritz, Have your self a Merry Little Christmas, The Last Time I saw Paris and others. This is one show you will watch over and over again. It is well put together and well narited."
3,"good for whetting your appetite, but ...","i agree with most of horiuchi's review except i found feinstein's narration to be irritating. he's too earnest and has a rather plastic smile, and i found myself fervently wishing that they had replaced his performances (of which there are too many, esp in the second section) with real footage. the pacing is a little rushed b/c of the large amount of territory covered, and a bit confusing in the way the film jumps back and forth between composers b/c everything is presented chronologically. clips are generally great, but ultimately disappointing because usually they just show the verse and the first chorus and then sometimes they skip to the finale, i.e. less than 1/2 of the actual song. in other words, all in all it's good as an introduction to this genre, but for many of these you'll want to see the movies the clips are from."
5,Music Nostalgia,"My wife and I found this tremendously entertaining, informative and absorbing.We sang along with most of the songs and found some of the moments definitely moving. The host was not intrusive and the use of movie clips to illustrate the narrative was ingenious.In a period when most movies are made for 14-year old boys, this is a treat for those of us who love movies and music. Having a Cosmopolitan while watching is definitely advised."
2,Okay...,"I found the narraration terrible and boring. It seemed like he was lip sinking and his words did not match his mouth movement. I would have liked to see more performances and less of him. Also most of the performances seemed to be Judy Garland. I was amazed that there she was again and again, not that I don't like her but its not a Judy documentary. I was also disapointed that they ended with ""Annie Get Your Gun"". There was absolutely nothing about the great musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein like where was ""Oklahoma"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""My Fair Lady"", ""Music Man"", ""King and I""? These are some of the best musicals ever yet they were left off which I think is sad. Hopefully htey will have a part two where these musicals are covered."
4,Got me started in Jazzy stuff,"I've been a guitar player for 25 years. About 22 years ago I picked up this album. No idea why. It wasn't me. I was a rocker. Anyhow, this album led me into jazz guitar. Larry is an awesome player. Did you see who else plays on this? Jeff Pocaro on drums. Great music. This is a slow tempo CD. It's a chill out kind of thing. His new CD is a rocker though. But if your looking at good lad back music and some nice playing this is it. It's not going to rip or anything though. He's not a flashy guy. Conservative but right on the money and you can tell he bleeds studio work.Dave"
4,Using your senses to prepare for Passover,"A child describes the Passover preparations of his (or her, we aren't told which) family. Each time the child asks a question about the preparations he is told to use one of his 5 senses to figure out the answer. This clever presentation teaches us about the foods, story and games of Passover.An enjoyable book for 4-8 year olds."
2,th,"The guitar was a birthday gift for my 6 yr old nephew who loved it. When he opened the box in front of the rest of the kids I felt my first glimmer of shame. It had just arrived from amazon that morning so I didn't have a chance to inspect it. How embarrasing that the guitar can't even be tuned since it's not quality. The paint was chipped on each of the frets (?) So again I hung my head in shame. On the plus side- he is a boy so he'll probably end up finding alternative uses for the guitar, such as a shovel or baseball bat."
1,Terrible - couldn't return it fast enough!,"Warning, this seems like a great deal for all you get for the price. I have gotten items of better quality from Cracker Jack boxes. I took one look at it and packed it back up for return. Poorly made, not attractive, nothing quality about this product AT ALL."
2,jewel-less,".An expected plot, with an expected ending.."" A Fairy Tale Story "".Not what I expected..jc"
3,"Very nice luggage set, but cheap on the important details","I was delighted and surprised when I received this luggage set. It was a lot more, a lot bigger, and a lot nicer-looking than I expected. The visual appeal is very nice. It's an attractive design. I was extremely delighted with the set when I received it.HOWEVER . . . the first time I used it, the hardware failed. It was not an ""essential"" hardware failure. I was using the largest suitcase on a cross-country flight from NY to CA. When the bag came around on the carousel in CA, I reached out to grab it, reaching for the plastic standup support. The support popped right off. The hardware is chintzy."
4,Bounty once again proclaim his dominance of the reggae scene,"This is truly worth getting if you are any type of dancehall fan. Bounty is no doubt the leader of the dancehall scene and he proves it with this album. This one is a pure reggae LP. Fifth element includes the hit ""Look"" on the bug riddin' which is banned in Jamaica. Also Anytime and Mr. Wanna Be which you could pump up the volume when you listen. Also for the conscious minded, there are couple tracks with Barrington Levy and Junior Reid. Trust me, this album is worth it, was well worth the wait since Millenium."
2,Hawk Eternal,"I just couldn't really get in into this book. It seemed messy and poorly put together as you go between worlds and such.There were too many loose ends and the characters would do random, out of character things at times. It just may be me looking in to the book to much, but I felt that when the book was written, the author didn't put enough of himself into the characters. As a result, the characters seemed to have lacked definition.But, on the bright side, the plot was certainly interesting and unique. Points there."
3,Not Gemmell's Best Offering,"The first 2/3 of the book are classic Gemmell. The battle scenes, the challenge, the characters are all there. Then we take a turn into druids and their magic, time travel and portals, an ancient race and multiple realities. It is all very confusing and detracts from the novel."
2,"""The Hawk Queen arrives in a parallel version of her own universe...""","That's the jacket introduction - and this is the set tone for much of the book - the current enemy is really from out of the past - but from somewhere in the future there is a chance to save the present. And so, what starts as a very easy read - ye olde speak, a battle, an orphan, a man who is a leader in the eyes of his people but is at odds with the leader of his people, some magic and a prophecy... slides into a game of Chutes & Ladders as the wires get crossed - gates are opened and closed - characters arrive early as old and dying and then return later from earlier times young and ready for battle - la la la.I stuck with it - unknotting the story more times than I care to count. Not a bad read [it was a vacation airport purchase], but it's not likely I'll pursue others by Gemmell."
2,Such a Waste,"I finished this book with a great feeling of loss - not because I never wanted it to end, but because it had the potential to be quite good and couldn't seem to manage it. The storyline is original, but most of the characters (especially the heroine, who really got on my nerves after awhile) have no depth (excepting the hero - I really wished he could find himself another female interest, because he was much to good for the annoying heroine) and the dialogue (which is filled with pop culture references and what are supposed to be witty quips, but aren't) falls flat in places. This book is worth buying used, but definitely not worth paying full price for."
2,Hoo-boy Ho-Hum,"Except for the occasional witty wisecrack, I honestly found this book boring. I managed to get through about 85 pages before I started skimming through large sections just to finish it. The ending didn't intrigue me enough to want to go back and recapture the pages I skipped. Obviously others have enjoyed this book, unfortunately, I am not one of them. ZZZZZZzzzzz"
2,ho-kay,"I am a fantasy fan who also reads paranormal romances and i have to say this one could have been better. It's back blurp makes it sound funny and entertaining and was completely misleading. I found myself barely able to stay awake. The heroine automatically accepts that the planet she is on is guiding her destiny, even though she is a modern day woman from earth. She doesn't question what she should and i found her a little shallow. While parts were slightly surprising i didn't find anything that made me gasp in shock. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 due to some of the thought she made in creating the world, but the plot was pretty bad. I don't think i'll reread this book and i would borrow a book written her from the library before i bought one. If you want a light pice of fluff with maybe some magic thrown in you have it in this one."
3,What do you say???,Totally different from anything else I've ever read. Cute story but not for me. I don't want to read about another elf or fairy or dwarf. Maybe I'd enjoy another book by C. Sterling? Happy reading.
4,good read,"This was just a fun book. The main character is kind of wacky, but I liked her. The characters were not fully developed-at least not as much as I would have liked. I did enjoy the story and it was a quick read. I would read another book by the author. It's not great, but good."
5,Hard edged funk-fusion for the 21st century,"Adam holzman has formed an excellent band in the spirit of the early jazz/rock pioneers. Strong writing, killer grooves and ethereal keyboard soundscapes all combine to make a fairly effective jazz/rock document for the late 90s. Check out the track ""Jumpin' Jupiter""."
4,Great show! Episodes are NOT COMPLETE!,"I love I Dream of Jeannie - always have, always will. I've faithfully been collecting all of the seasons and eagerly purchased the long-awaited final season. Imagine my dissappointment though to find that the episodes are missing scenes and are not complete. Several scenes I recall seeing when I was a kid and even in syndicated reruns are blatently missing here. Have to admit, I feel cheated. I still gave a 4-star review because of how much I love the show - but it should have been 5 stars and isn't because The makers of this DVD package didn't take care to give us the original-broadcast length episodes!"
2,Episodes Not Complete,"It's too bad for the price we pay for these sets that the studio cannot release the original uncut, unedited episodes. I've only watched the first few shows from this fifth season set but they are only running 23 - 24 minutes, when shows from this time period still ran somewhere between 25 - 26 minutes per episode."
5,Yay! Season 5,"I can't wait for the fifth and final season of Jeannie! This was actually my favorite. It had the Bellows more involved in the stories. I found Dr. Bellows and his wife to be hilarious! Great episodes involving appearing and disappearing floors in hotels, the Bellow's nephew stealing Jeannie's bottle with her in it, the house getting redecorated (very cool I might add), old wine making the Bellows invisible and the final episode where Dr. Bellows finally finds out the truth about Jeannie (even if it was a dream it was still cool). This will also complete the entire series and collection for us Jeannie fans! I've waited decades to have this series so it will be good to get this last set. Thank you Sony Entertainment and Amazon!"
5,love it!,"I love this show, and I love the last season! It is such a clean fun! With great charcters played by gorgeous actresses and actors! Love love love it!"
2,Dorothy Costume,"I was very excited to recieve this dorothy costume for my 3 month old daughter, but I did expect it to be a little smaller. It seems big enough to fit a 9 month old baby in it, and by Halloween comes my daughter will only be 3 1/2 months. I guess I wish I knew the actual size before ordering this product. She will be wearing it reguardless, but I will need to get out my sewing machine and do some alterations."
1,Cannibal Vampire Schoolgirls From Outer Space,"The title sounds campy. It looks like it should be worth watching, it's not. It has poor acting, lousy camera work, no special effects, no nudity. The actors aren't even good looking. It was so boring that I never saw the end of the movie. If I had rented it for 3 bucks I would have felt robbed."
4,drawing a head,"This video is hard to review. It is well produced and Susan Lyon carefully describes what she is doing as she develops the drawing that is on the DVD cover.My problem with it was that she started with an eye, and drew the rest of the head from that. I understand that experienced artists do this, but as a beginner I hoped she would show more of the initial layouts and measurements.So if you are a little more experienced and interested in shading, tonality, the use of pastel pencils and the development of features I would give it 5 stars. If you are more of a beginner I think there are better choices and I would give it 3."
5,MONSTER Scissors!!!!!!!!!,"Shears is right! These things are huge and have cut through anything so far. The only drawback I have seen (and not enough to drop the rating) is that if you have small hands, these shears might be too big to use. Especially for the price at which these are offered, everyone should have a pair."
2,My first Republic let down!,I have seen the previews of this title and the previews are better than the serial! I have up until now thought Republic could do no wrong with their Movie serials...I was wrong! This one smells like something died and came back just to die again!
4,One of the Better Western Cliffhangers,"This an enjoyable cliffhanger with some excellent character acting.Don ""Red"" Barry is an excellent Red Ryder. Noah Beery as a sinister villan ""enforcer"" who does the bidding of an evil banker boss. Little Beaver plays a major role and saves Red from certain disaster on numerous occasions. This is definitely one of the better western serials with black hearted, evil villains and strong, pure of heart good guys. Some creative endings to each chapter keep you hanging on to the edge of the cliff!"
2,Not what I thought....,"CO2 NOT compatible... I had to go buy $60 worth of extra products to make this work without having to buy their $300 bottle. Not exactally what I wanted, but lesson learned !"
2,the phone that does everything....except make phone calls!,"I have gone through many different cell phones and let me tell you...this phone is overpriced and does pretty much everything but make decent phone calls! I was told by T Mobile that this was a great phone, and it did everything and so I only got this phone as a replacement because my TM Sharp 150 broke and this was the free replacement that matched my old cell phone's quality of pictures (My TM Sharp 150 took the best pictures ever!!!). Well, it's true...It swivels every different way, has a MP3 on it, records videos and takes pictures (although NOT good pictures; poor lighting, bad quality, crappy focus, overall bad pictures)but the one thing I have the hardest time doing with this cell phone is MAKING PHONE CALLS! It does not have good reception or a strong signal and overall it is NOT worth the $500 it can retail for. My advice is to buy another phone and spend the extra money elsewhere."
5,The Dogs...,Superb straight ahead Punk n Roll. Intelligent and smart as well as loud and angry.Think The Jam at their tuneful loudest rather than the dad rock of Weller and you won't be far wrong.
3,Live CD Fails To Capture Dayne's Best,"Taylor Dayne's first live effort finds one of pop's greatest voices sounding strangely muffled, in large part due to the poorsound quality and production of the album itself and less with the singer herself. The album's sound manages to mute much of Dayne's finest songs, with her career benchmark 'I'll Be Your Shelter' coming off as particularly dull. The ballads here come off far better, particularly the underrated 'Send Me A Lover'. She also breezes through several non-album tracks, which wouldn't be so bad if there were at least a couple of tracks from her first-rate NAKED WITHOUT YOU album represented. As it stands, average Dayne is better than most singers' best, but it still falls short."
1,Not a Honeywell product,"The description says ""Genuine Honeywell Part."" It is not. I have owned 3 Honeywell 50300 air purifiers for the past 5 years, and the Honeywell filters for the product have a black base and top, and black mesh on the sides. The filter being sold here has a white base and top, and white mesh on the sides. It smells bad, too, like adhesive.The filter being sold here, according to the information contained in the box is actually an RPS product, Model E295."
4,Bad Taste Fun,"T.S. Slaughter's film is probably the most in-your-face bad taste gay film I've ever seen, and I really enjoyed it. The acting is wonderfully subpar (and recalls early John Waters), the humor all over the place, and the screenplay a punch in the face to the politically correct. Nathan and Justin are ""roommates with benefits"" that are bored of their college lives and decide to get even with the ""Ivy"" boys by abducting, raping and killing them. Michael Burke is particularly wonderful as Justin -- his line ""You're awesome, Nathan!"" becomes funnier every time he delivers it. This is certainly not a film for everyone (the easily offended need not apply), but based on sheer audacity alone Skull & Bones is a must-see for viewers with alternative tastes. If you like touching tales of coming out and loving gay relationships, this is a must-avoid!"
4,400 Years rocks!!,"This ""new""/""old"" album is worth every cent. I watched them live with Delvic in western Mass. The album is a carbon copy of the energy they can give you in a live environment. Like Transmit Failure their latest recording, It always packs a punch and yet keeps an eery melodic flow to it.This is a great record for anyone into Hardcore,emo,indi,pop,rock,and even heavymetal. I think this is a must have for any collector! Four hundred years is four very nice down to earth people who would be glad to shake your hand and say hello after the show. Check them out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ..."
1,Terrible!,"This is a horrible product. The hardware doesn't fit together correctly, so when you attempt to put it together, it doesn't really work. The end result is an incredibly wobbly table that LITERALLY falls apart when you put anything on it. A total waste of money. Don't buy it!"
2,Stinks,"I'm all for natural sunblock for my kid, but this stuff really just smells. I like lemongrass as much as the next guy, but I prefer it in thai food."
4,A Good and Enjoyable Read...,"As one who loves to read and a Christian, I must say this is an entertaining Christian fiction with humorous situations which had me laugh out loud every once in a while. You really like the characters in the book (well, not including Darcy) and want the best for all of them. It could have been a little more descriptive, but besides that, it was a fun and quick read while getting my hair done. I would recommend to anyone who likes Christian fiction and wouldn't mind a sequel."
3,"Good Story, but was the script flipped?...hmmm",Ford offers a good read. The setting and plot appear predictable but offer some juicy turns and twists. The characters are not super original but do bring something to the plate that makes them interesting enough to follow. The storyline is well written and delivers a good read go to the library and check this one out you'll have a relaxing time which is why it was given a Bronze rating..
3,It works but not in Windows Vista,"A decent game for the little ones but be forewarned, it will not run under Windows Vista and will run in XP only if you haven't upgraded Internet Explorer to version 7. The security feature of IE7 prevents the game from running, something Activision Value acknowledges. And since IE7 is integrated into Vista, it's a no-go for Dora. (Thank goodness for dual-boot systems, my solution after the a new release of a Microsoft OS).The game is fun enough for my three year old although a bit challenging since he's still learning how to use the mouse."
2,"Dull, repetitive",This game was a complete waste of time for a 4-year old. The activities were limited and repetitive and there was very little to aid a child's development and some were mind-numbingly dull. I was disappointed that there was not more about the different countries that Dora visited.This will entertain for 1 or 2 hours maximum.
1,Will not work.,"You can't make this game work on XP with IE8. Even when you call Activision, they can't help you get it working."
1,Compatability issues,"I too have had problems with installing this game on my daughter's computer that runs Windows XP with the IE7 update. Tried it on my CPU with Vista and it didn't work either. I'm surprised that this was the only game that didn't work since all her other games (Lost City, Animal Adventures, BackPack game, and Diego game) work without any problems. I wonder what's so special about this game?"
5,This is a wonderful book !,"Lorraine Dopson's ""The Light at the End of the World"" is a great work of fiction. I believe that some day it will become a classic in women's literature. The dialogue is engaging and it is hard to put the book down. The book is well researched and shows a great deal of insight into human nature, as one might expect from a writer with a PhD in counseling and guidance. The story takes place 12,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. I highly commend Dr Dopson in choosing not to dumb down the dialogue. This book presents a fascinating view of a world before patriarchy. It is a spiritual book that is devoid of dogmatic religion. The characters are colorful, the storyline is engaging, the drawings by the author are excellent, and the print is easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone"
2,Rehashing of Better Dinosaur Shows,"How can we make more money out of our excellent dinosaur series? Let's take bits & pieces of it, mush it all together & get a big name to do the voice-overs! If you have not already watched the other dinosaur shows in this series, fling this one on the garbage heap & get the really good ones. This was not very good. My son, the resident dinosaur expert, watched it for ten minutes, took it out & put Walking With the Dinosaurs back in. He put it on the library return pile immediately. I'd have to agree with his review. Due to the excellence of the other series, it can't be completely terrible, but it sure comes close!"
3,Its Alright,Well I think its alright.See its the same thing as walking with dinasours but with shorter time and a different narrater.Its for kids of course.I got this when I was 9 or 10.Im glad they made it for kids.The episodes are in the same order but with different names.(I cant remember what they are)But its a 3 star program because the jokes stink and ben stiller isnt the best narrater.Thats why its 3 stars.But I reccomend it for little kids.But I dont reccoment it for adults or teenagers or kids ages 8 to 12 either.Well thats all I have to say.Ta ta for now.
2,Edited & Pirated from Walking With Dinosaurs,I was extremely dissapointed with this program and sold it. It had the same footage as Walking With Dinosaurs and the narration was annoying to say the least. I will not have this in my DVD Library. Get Walking With Dinosarus and Walking With Prehistoric Beasts. They are much better and well worth the money and the time. They can be viewed over and over again.
1,My children are dumber for having watched this.,Children are not stupid. They can understand many concepts when put clearly and visually. Get walking with dinosaurs. It is excellent.
1,Get the Real thing,This DVD is simply a cut up watered down version of the masterpiece Walking with Dinosaurs. Go buy the real thing. The amazing classic that amazed the world. Someone had the idea take this show. Get a youner American narrater and cut a half hour out of it. It is a usless cashing in on Walking with Dinosaurs success. There is no need for this.
1,Get Walking with Dinosaurs!!!,"""Prehistoric Planet"" is just a Discovery Kids copy of BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts. Cut over 30 minutes of it and get a younger, sillier narrator and call it a different name and there you go - Prhistoric Planet. Nobody needs this. Great if you don't have the real thing, but if you do... 0 Stars!!!"
5,Daughter loves it!,"My daughter watched this show a few years ago on Animal Planet. They stopped showing it and she was devastated! Santa brought this and, at age 7 now, she still loves it!"
4,Prehistoric Planet,"My kids are Ben Stiller fans so his narration made it entertaining. It is a very educational video for kids especially with interests for dinosaurs. If your child does not have an interest for dinos, I suggest purchasing other videos that do not have as much narration and more action."
5,Great for dino-loving kids,"If your child is in the dinosaur-obsessive phase as my son is, this is totally worth buying. The simulated dinosaur action is quite amazing - looks pretty real most of the time, and Ben Stiller's narration, which sounds half ad-libbed, is reasonably entertaining for the grownup in the room. I expect we'll be watching this many more times."
5,Great DVD,My 4 year old loves Prehistoric planet. This is a great DVD to take along in the car and to be able to watch the show on a whim.
5,Awesome!!!,My 11 year old son loves Dinosaurs so this was a natural choice to add to his DVD collection.
1,Well.....?,"The first thing you must notice when you are reading this book is that Cory J Meacham is a journalist, not a zoologist. In the book he constantly talks about killing, euthanizing and even hunting the tigers, that the book (in my opinion) starts to get a wee bit morbid. He dosent talk about planing the birth of tigers in zoos, in a sort of conservation sence but rather that births just happen. So his solution was insted of puting a little effort in and planing the births of the tigers we should just let them mate whenever and then euthanize the cubs. He dosent talk abut collectivising the villages and settelments around tiger reserves,and land distribution issues concerning tiger reserves. Also he talks very little about anti-poaching patrols and how effective they can be as we have seen with rhinos in Kaziranga."
1,The author went and put 7 5 star ratings for this book,"Hansen (I presume) went to all of his books, made 6 users and gave the top rating. Check out all the ratings by these reviewers above. They were all made on roughly the same day, their only ratings are on Hansen's books, and they're all stupid made up names."
3,Lacking Visual,"Harry Rand's Book ""The Implication of Symbols"" is indeed well-written and full of important information. Furthermore, his interpretation of the symbolic aspects of Gorky's work as it relates to his life is competent stuff. But here's where to start with a book on visual art: how many paintings does the book show, and of these, how many are in color. An art book discussing artwork that is either not shown in the book, or that is shown only in black and white (when a colorplate is crucial), is a frustrating read. At $..., one expects more than 15 color plates, some of which are poorly reproduced. I'm grateful for the information Mr. Rand provides, but greatly disappointed at the amount of work reproduced in what could otherwise be a complete presentation of the artist and his painting."
4,"Excellent, Readable Analysis","A well structured thorough analysis of the formal derivations, composition and media techniques of this extremely important artist. One always wishes for endless illustrations so that the reader could extend the engaging search of motives revealed in the analysis. There are easily enough illustrations here to tempt you. An excellent companion to any illustrated collection of the artist's paintings and drawings."
4,Very Period--Suggest authenticity and accuracy,"The book features great dated pictures of Karen alone and dancing with a variety of men with dated hairdos and suites, including weird silhouette illustrations of her figure. Nearly every page also contains a retro 20s image. It mostly features instructions for different steps, with only a small portion of the book dedicated to line and partner dances such as the Hustle. I also was unable to figure out how to do the Latin Hustle or any of its variations from the instructions given, but I've never read a dance book before or received any dance instruction."
2,Not worth the money,I am a K-8 School Counselor and purchased this thinking the entire DVD was about Bullies. It actually is only a 10 min. segment which is somewhat outdated (didn't even mention the impact of the internet). I also purchased 20/20 DVD The 'In Crowd' and Social Cruelty which is better.
2,pointless,"I purchased this dvd thinking that it was about bullying, but in reality, only the first 10 minutes are about a few stories of victims of bullying. There is no discussion of what contributes to bullying or how to deal with bullies - the video simply presents the stories. The rest of the stories on the DVD are unrelated to the title of the DVD"
4,Good but not Enough,"This is a fairly good book. It gives you the basis needed in order to step up to other books. It has the advantage of being the official guide, so everything written inside can be trusted to be correct. I suggest to make it the first book you read and then step up to a more detailed one. That said, the book is worth its money."
2,CD only for Windows!,"The software does not work on Mac OS (or anything but Windows), so the value of this product was greatly diminished for Mac users.Book is ok, though."
1,No one should ever buy this book,The arrogance of selling a product that so many people can't use has me dumbfounded. I guess I have to take the test wihout the aid which I have spent so much money on. There should be a law against selling this product.(The CD does not work on neither Windows vista nor Mac)
4,A lot information,This book was a gift for my daughter and I hope this will be helpful for her. THANK YOU.
4,good book,It's a good book to prepare for the toefl exam. But still you will need alot of practicing. Try to get used to the exam by practicing alot of exams on the toefl website.
1,No Window vista,This CO doessn't work on window vista. Please don't buy it if you have window vista version
1,Smooth jazz at it's worst,"The cd opens up with one of those synthetic funk grooves characteristic of smooth jazz, particularly uninspired in this instance, marred also by a tinny recording quality. However, the fundamental flaw of this disc is Davis's trombone which sounds murky and weak, especially atop all the electronic ""smooth"" mayhem. The session is not rewarding in the least bit... no improvisational fire, no rhythmic inspiration, no harmonic interest. Just Davis's thin trombone atop what can only be described as ""ungrooves."" unrecommended"
2,Blade is damaged after 2 months of use,We used this juicer for 2 months. After one month the juicer began to vibrate and make weird noices that scared our kids and cat. Finally the blade is dead and we are ready to get rid of this machine. Machine looks very nice and I give it 2 stars for the look.
2,disappointed,"This is the second identical juicer I have purchased. The firstwas sent in for warranty work and was returned to me withoutresolution of the problem. They are making their second attempt to fix it (now out of warranty due to my procrastination).The reports I have read say it is the best, but I am not so sure."
4,A singer that is hard to categorize!,"After her smashing performance in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" there were many - myself included - that thought that the sky was the limit for Holliday. However, it appears that no one knew what to do with the singer. She was just too good for the mass audience.This album, produced by EWF's Maurice White, runs the gamut from torch songs to pop ditties to gospel-influenced R & B with some success. Featuring works from outstanding songwriters like David Foster and Nick Ashford & Valerie Simpson, the album seemed destined for greatness.Sadly, it did not perform as was expected. But, the powerhouse voice of Holliday still managed to transcend the poor sales and ""Feel My Soul,"" even after all these years, is deserving a place in any collection of soulful divas.Playing time: 40:50"
4,Ballad and Funky stuff,"Excellent!If you like the combination of Maurice White and David Foster writting and producing great music you'll love ths record.And, What a voice this woman has!This record sounds like Powerlight of Earth, Wind & Fire sometimes.Good, good, good."
5,a terrific novel,"If you are looking for a different view of heaven and earth, I definitely recommend this book. Mr Knight combines an intresting view of the life after death and a closer look at biblical scriptures. Order it and you won't be disappointed."
5,Alive,"Piano parts and vocals for the Alive In South Africa concert. Piano parts are fairly advanced. Includes 'Take the Limits Off,' 'You've Been a Friend,' 'He Knows My Name,' 'Alpha and Omega,' and 'Your Latter Will Be Greater.' The book also stays open very easily (nice binding for pianists.)"
2,Same old garbage from EA sports,"Don't get suckered into the hype surrounding the good graphics and sound of this game, it's just same old junk that EA sports releases under the NBA Live franchise every year. The AI isn't any better than last year (one still misses lay-ups, makes bad passes, etc to make up for the lack of computer-controlled defense). Also, there are still joystick/control problems regarding player control. In short, if you dig a shallow game with a lot of eye-candy, this is for you. Otherwise steer clear of it."
2,I HATE THE LIVE SERIES,I think that this game was very poorly made without much thought i hate live series and i wouldnt reccomend this basketball
2,Stick with NBA Live 2000,This year's version of NBA Live is in my opinion the second worse release of the series. NBA Live '96 being the worse. The graphics are better than 2000 but that's about it. Gameplay is horrible. It is way too difficult to hit a shot on Superstar difficulty. You're lucky if you can shoot 20% in a game - very unrealistic. The 3-team trade option isn't much of an big advancement either in single player game.No wonder the release date was pushed to almost 3 months later than originally schedule. They should have taken another month or two. I am very disappointed.Save your money and stick with the 2000 version.
5,Slashin' to the hole!,"NBA Live 2001 is the maximum fun you will ever have out of a NBA computer game. With EA Sports' real life graphics, they make you feel like you're really In The Game! With some new annimations and take your soul to the hole features that including the 1960's -2000 all star teams avaliable for gameplay, NBA Live 2001 is worth every cent that you pay!"
1,"I can't rank the quality, because the game doesn't work","Buyer beware: this game does not work at all on a laptop. It simply won't run. Why EA released something this full of bugs is beyond me. I wasted hours going through their trouble shooting tips, all so that I could end up having to return it. What a waste..."
4,NBA Live 2001...Some improvements,"EA sports has given this game better graphics than it's previous games. The problem with this game is that now not nearly as many shots go in. I feel that that is not a major problem and would not dissuade me from buying it. Otherwise, the players ratings are more realistic, the players look more realistic, and the three-way trade option is good. But...about the three way trades, you can't give players from one Computer team to another, but it is almost essential to make a three-way trade work."
3,Not as good as last year,"Don't get me wrong. I did by it on the first day. I just waited this long to write a review.This game's ok. But it's not as good as 2K. WHAT???? No custom team. I was planning on putting my school team against the pros. No Practice, 3point shootout and refs!? At least the gameplays good."
4,"good game, way too easy","this is a really great game, but, just like every NBA Live game ever made, it's way too easy, which makes it get boring much quicker."
3,"Great graphics, but flaws in the game play","NBA Live 2001 has some amazing graphics, some of the best I've seen to date for a baseketball game, but sadly the the gameplay is flawed in several areas. The first very frustrating flaw is when your guy is taking to the basket on a fast break, and the guy will just stop a shoot a little jump shot and miss it, instead of dunking or laying the ball in at times. This is especially frustrating when you use a guy like Shaq when it appears he can dunk it, but instead decides to shoot a jump shot. And even when he gets a dunk attempt, the player will even screw that up too at times. The second major flaw is that all of your computer players are lazy and don't run after the ball, so expect to get your brains beat in on the boards at times. This game has the potential to be a great game with it's great graphics and sounds, but these two big flaws really hurt the game a great deal. I hope EA Sports fixes these flaws in next year's game."
2,pales in comparison to nba live 2000,"its fair to make a direct comparison to live 2000- and the conclusion is that live 2000 is a much better game. live 2001 suffers from a lack of smooth and intuitive gameplay that seemed to come so naturally with live 2000. the cut-away shots are VERY realistic and awesome looking, but the regular viewpoint of the gameplay looks a step below (in my opinion) of live 2000. however, easports easily still produces the best NBA simulation on the market. while live 2001 is a notch below 2000, 2000 was one of the best sports games ever and would be hard to duplicate its success. so buy 2001 for the roster updates but dont expect to be blown away."
1,"Not a movie, not porn... just ugly, amateur home video","Please don't -- I repeat -- DON'T waste your time or money. This ""movie"" is a bad joke, a nightmare, a scam! Tedious scenes of humor with drag-queen moms alternate with garish scenes of soft-core porn, all apparently shot with the cheapest home video camera imaginable. So yes, there is some full nudity and semi-pornography (edited so as *not* to be x-rated), but only the most desperate person will find it titillating. A 100 percent rip-off."
3,My Younger Cousin,spotty in the good parts. you have to slow down the action to actually see anything real good going on.i give it a *** for the effort and the actings not bad for an older pride movie.
1,Don't be Fooled!,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this is a drama about a boy's journey to visit his cousin. From beginning to end, this movie is pure ...Porn, and should be rated ""X""! (I can find no rating on the description page, or the cover box.) The storyline as outlined in the description is highly misleading. The opening scene is shockingly graphic porn, and so is the rest of the whole movie. ..."
3,Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this book, because it says Flowers and Nature, and shows a beautiful flower on the front cover, but she doesn't show you how to do anything that nice. Also all of her examples look unfinished and unrealistic. Her trees are the worst, but she does great bark, but she doesn't show you, she just tells you how to do it.I have a lot of respect for Lee Hammond, as I think she is very talented. I have her drawing horses book and I think it's wonderful.The only thing I like about this book is the tips in the front of the book.Also, I don't consider an artichoke and peppers to be nature. Also she just shows you the butterfly that's on the front cover, the same as she does the beautiful flower, she doesn't show you how to accomplish them. She does do one pretty rose with Col-erase pencils."
1,200 'tablets',"I ordered this online as the price was definitely cost effective compared to buying it in the local grocery store. Many were broken within the bottle, and every one that I took from the bottle and put into a weekly dispenser disintegrated completely. I would definitely avoid buying these again and look for something with a protective coating."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased the two pack, but when I openened the first bottle all the tablets were disintegrating and at the bottom of the container is deep in powder. Although I am managing to take the crumbling tablets I will be looking for Softgels for my next order.Taking the product has relieved the muscle pain which I suffered from taking a statin. My muscles also are stronger."
5,"Deep, brooding, and magical",Beautiful Japanese melodies for flute and orchestra. The vocal and flute pieces are very emotional.
3,Japanese/Romantic pageantry,"The Gate bridges Japanese traditional forms with a Romantic classical vision, most obviously in the pieces where a string quartet is enlisted to play folkloric melodies. For the most part, the album beautifully unfolds Hirota's view of nature as being the cradle of humans (rather than our enemy), but on the last half of the disc, synthetic keyboard strings mar the overall sound. But Hirota's percussion workouts help balance this clumsiness with what is ultimately the most subtle manifestation of his philosophy."
5,"Love it, love him","I had this DVD years ago and it was awesome! It was stolen so I ordered another copy. Tony Little's videos are so much fun to work out to. It doesn't take long before you are saying the same words he's saying, it's that much fun!!! I highly recommend this DVD, as well as any of his videos!"
5,praise from a rev war author,"Great to find this work on one of the boats in the northern campaigns of the Rev War. Good stuff. - Gregory Edgar, author of 6 books on the Rev War, 2 on the northern campaigns"
2,Another warning...,"This appears to be the same CD as London Live '68 with a new title, so don't get both! And yes, the sound quality is very poor..."
4,"Excellent live album, ****1/2.","Fleetwood Mac Live (late 1980) #14. Recorded for the ""TUSK"" tour. ""Fireflies"" would be their only single hitting #60 in the hot 100 and #59 MSR. ""I'm So Afraid"" and ""Not That Funny"" are really something else. ""Oh Well"" is a great take of Peter Green's classic. Lindsey Buckingham really stars on this, great guitar work."
3,OK - More Miss Than Hit,"Some really good moments and lots of really bad moments -- the live version of ""It's Not That Funny"" is annoying, obnoxious and embarassing! Lindsey Buckingham needs to stop yelling and yelping and try singing instead. Wish it had a live version of Angel - their best song in my opinion. Could be a great 1-disc album but too much garbage for 2 discs so can't recommend this."
4,Since I wasn't there...,...due to not being born yet this is as good as it gets for me as far as hearing them live at the time.
5,Another A+ performance!,"All the tracks are awesome, especially Sara! If you are Fleetwood Mac fan this is a great cd to get! Buy it and you'll love it!"
2,Fleetwood Mac: More Dead than Live,"As a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac, I found this 'live album' a major disappointment. The tracks sound as if they were recorded in a tunnel, lacking the spontaneity and energy of the studio recordings. Of the offerings, Christine McVie comes to breathy, urgent life in a beautiful rendition of ""Over and Over"", and Stevie Nicks' ""Rhiannon"" pulsates, but itself can only hint at the furious Joplanesque vocal crescendo contained on the ""Fleetwood Mac Live in Passaic 1975"". Buckingham delivers a knockout performance of ""I'm So Afraid"" but otherwise hogs the mike and all too clearly thinks himself the band's centerpiece, which he is clearly not. His songs are often mediocre and under-developed. All things considered, this live album is more 'dead' than alive."
2,"Choose ""The Dance"" Instead","This album, recorded during Fleetwood Mac's 1979-1980 ""Tusk"" tour is disappointing. The vocals sound weak and mushy throughout. This CD documents a band that was tired and coked-out and is not even close to the excellent album ""The Dance."" While it's nice to have a live version of ""Rhiannon"" the way Stevie Nicks performed it in the 1970's, there is little else to recommend this CD. ""Sara"" is a disappointment and you can barely hear ""Landslide."" At the other end, Lindsey Buckingham screams ""Not That Funny"" for nearly ten minutes and ""Go Your Own Way"" sounds like a demo. Christine McVie is obviously indifferent in her songs."
5,a classic live album from the REAL Mac,"without a doubt one of the BEST rock bands alive. I bought the vinyl years ago and recently bought the CD. All the songs are performed excellent. Favorites are: Sara, Never going back again, Over & Over, Rhiannon, Go your own way, I am so afraid, Fireflies and Landslide, which in my opinion is one of the most emotional performances Stevie has done ever, you can listen to the depth and the emotions in every whisper and words from her voice, truly amazing."
5,DESERT ALIVE,The sounds of the desert are a wonderful symphony of nature. This CD transports me in a desert Oasis full of surprising sounds. I also like the version with music added:DESERT DREAMS (Tranquility Series)
5,"""REPLACE"" something on your shelf with THIS !!","Great movie!! Have already watched it twice, once with my wife (she liked it) and once with my father (loved it). Great story, great laughs, hard hits, and great cast of characters. Like other reviewers, this movie also reminded me of Major League in regards to a strike in which ""replacement"" players must be used. This movie flowed great, and the music really matched the action on the screed. The DVD had some pretty good extras too."
5,Awesome Football Movie,"If you love football, mixed with some good comedy, this is a MUST WATCH!!!A CLASSIC that withstands the test of time!!!!"
4,Great movie,"Good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes football and cheerleaders. It shows how a team can come together and do the impossible."
5,Highly recommended!,Fantastic movie I love it!!!! This is a movie I can watch again and again without being bored. I would suggest this movie to everyone.
4,Fabulous movie!,The story was a great story. Some of the scenes were offensive and possibly should be rated with a stronger message. Lots of fowl language. Not a story for any children of any age. Only reason watched it to the end is because of the story line. Based on a true story...made me want to know the real story. I like that.
1,Run to daylight,"After laughing once in the first 45 minutes - and being interested in the story for zero minutes - I turned off the videotape of THE REPLACEMENTS. Not funny, not interesting, maybe the remainder of the picture was what gave it the high marks I saw in other reviews."
4,Simple and predictable story... but fun to watch,"Boy meets girl, buddies, underdog vs. favorite, a chance at redemption, throw in the expected group of misfits, some strippers, a little sentimemtality and there you have it. Hmm... sounds kinda like Armageddon (Another film I really liked).First and foremost the film is just funny. Whether it's John Madden diagrammin' a bustin play or guys goin' after their own teammates. Ok... so a lot of the humor was pretty infantile. So what. It's still funny.Just check it out for what films still can be. Entertaining."
3,Good for a laugh!,"This movie had some pretty funny parts especially with the cheerleaders. They are by far the funniest part of the show especially when they are trying to spell ""sentinels"" and the ""Who's your daddy?"" part. Gene Hackman doesn't do much for a movie with a good premise but leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, the NFL players go on strike leaving ""scabs"" to play in their place. Keanu Reeves, who's best acting is in My Little Buddha, plays the quarterback who gets the head cheerleader. It's good for a rental but I wouldn't suggest buying it."
4,"Solid movie, and lots of fun, guys will love it and so will the ladies..","This I must say is one of my favorite movies in my collection. The situations are pretty funny, and the shots during the games are OUCH! This is a pretty good date movie, if you ask me. My wife likes it a lot and laughs constantly, the romance is there and so are the guts and glory. Gene Hackmen is really good in this movie, and like I said the characters are lovable. The guys will love the cheerleaders, oh yes...they will love the cheerleaders, and the ladies will laugh about it too. Good story line about the triumph of the human spirit, and making dreams come true, and being determined. It inspires me, so let it inspire you. Watch it."
5,Increddibly Hilarios!!!,This movie will give you laughs for hours. It was filled with imature but funny events. I would give this movie a 100 stars if possible but they only give you five. From bar fights to increddibly riddiculous plays this a thumbs up. If you are into the funny stuff get this DVD.
5,A Fun Movie,"I would highly recommend this movie. I'm not really a football fan but this was such a funny movie. The characters are great and made me want to watch it again. As a matter of fact, I think I will buy it!"
5,A Wonderful Movie Keeps you Smiling the Whole Time,"This movie is not only well writtin, but keeps you laughing and smiling thoughouth the movie. The movie, staring Keanu Reeves, is definatly one of the years best. I recommend it to anyone that wants to have a smile on their faces."
3,Provides good laughs,"Keanu Reeves got $12 million to do this lightweight sports comedy about a group of replacement football players, all from different sides of the track, to fill in for the malicious and greedy players for a team. Loosely based on a football strike from 1987, The Replacements is a lightweight comedy that provides the laughs. It manages to blend the humor pretty well into a sports movie about playing football with heart. The film would not be good if it weren't rounded out by such a good cast. The always dependable Gene Hackman becomes the good guy/mentor to Reeves' quarterback. Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans, and Jon Favreau and the rest of the team provide comic relief as the out there players. A problem I have with the movie is the abrupt ending but aside from that, ""The Replacements"" is a satisfying rental."
4,Keanu at his best,"This is my second favourite Keanu Reeves movie, behind Point Break. A bit of sport, a bit of romance, and some feel-good moments. What's not to like about this DVD. It's a little bit cheesy in patches, but if you ask me, there's nothing wrong with that."
5,A good fun movie with heart.,Okay this isn't the most original movie out there. And it follows a very set and predictable formula. But given all that you still want the guys to succeed. You still want them to rise above what they thought they were and find something special. It's a good all round feel good movie about not quiting and of the strength of good friends. The plot is small but the laughs are big. Making this film well worth the watch and money. My wife loved this film and she has no love of football. Which makes me think that you do not have to be a big football fan to enjoy the movie. 5 stars well deserved.
5,I Love this movie,"I am a 64 year-old woman who admittedly likes football. However,this movie goes beyond the game and provides laughter and food for thought. Although I rarely watch a movie twice (exceptions are Casablanca, The Whale Rider and the Star Wars Trilogy), I watched this one over four times before I finally bought it and subsequently have watched it many more times. It is entertaining and moving (even when one knows the ending). Gene Hackman is a joy to watch. Really a ""feel good"" movie."
2,Snoozer,"The Replacements really isn't a bad movie. It's something of a cross between Necessary Roughness, Minor League, and Police Academy. It's totally predictable, and not very entertaining as a result. The reason formula movie like this keep coming out of Hollywood is that we keep going to see them, buying them, and renting them.All that holds it up are a few comedic scenes and the performances of the stars. John Madden and Pat Sumerall repeatedly announce the team's games, and they've got some great lines. Gene Hackman is under-utilized, but does a great job with his role. Keanu Reeves mails in another wooden performance and you're left wondering how he's ever cast in anything.The cinematography is great, but the camera work isn't challenging. There's nothing wrong with the video or audio-both are well produced, but this isn't a title that will show off your home theater system."
1,bad DVD,The disc froze up half way through the movie. Feel like I was misled by the seller but probably not - waited too long to return it.
3,football comedy,"I cant rate this movie since I didn't get a chance, someone stole it before I got to see it. I will purchase again once I get a list together"
2,not the real moviie,This is one of our favorite all time movies - except not the version that came from amazon this fall and was a gift to my son. He tells me that major portions of the music are different from the original; and the changed music does not match the action. Way to ruin a good movie. I will be looking into returning the dvd
4,not classic but fun,"This is a fun movie - the ``little guys'' triumph. It will never be classified a film classicbut Gene Hackman adds some acting gravitas and Keanu Reeves is perfect for the young, slightly confusedquarterback trying to win the game and the girl."
5,good flick looks better in hd.,Images were great. Love the flick. My favorite keanu reeves movie. Gene hackman is in fine form. It just makes u see some of the comedy on sports.
5,The Replacements,TERRIFIC.Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job.Brooke Langton is great as well as beautiful. I'm in love with her. In the scene in the pub she uses certain looks to explain just what she is thinking. The scenes with her and Keanu Reeves are great.The background music just adds to the enjoyment of this filmThis movie really helps you get an inside look at football. I would like to see a sequel where the cast of replacements gets brought in to the Sentinels as regular players.I think there are enough situations that can be expanded on to make a sequel.
3,My wife liked it too.,"Let's give it 3 1/2 stars. It's funny. Lots of football stereotypes, I think they all may be covered in this one. Broadly drawn characters. Hackman was good. Didn""t have to streach his acting muscles much. Pass the popcorn. Worth the rental price. I watched it once. Wouldn't buy it."
4,Great show,This is one of my husbands favorite movies...have seen it about 100 times on television so I thought it was about time just to buy the darn thing.
5,Great movie,"Never goes out of style... as good today as when it was released. I couldn't believe my significant other had never seen it, and he is a big football fan. He enjoyed it, and I did too even though it was about my 5th time!"
4,Lots of laughs,"This movie may start a bit slow but quickly warms up to FUNNY.Nice to see the ""misfits"" bond and be successful. Old story - zany twist."
4,"Entertaining, but Nothing New","Overall, you will remember Remember the Titans (interaction of each member), and Jerry McGuire (true spirit of sports) when watching this movie after the twos.Why this movie is worth to be watched more than once :1. Like other sport movies, you will find friendship, teamwork, sportsmanship, overcome previous failure, and doing the impossible. So .. you will enjoy the game.2. It's always interesting to watch someone (in this case, the coach) collecting different people with different skill to build the winning team, and how the skill is applied in the story.3. You will not bored. The story is flowing quite fast (only a few unnecessary scenes), lots of laughable moments and good songs.If you are film critics, perhaps you will find this film is 'usual' or 'light'. The plot is obvious, there is no intrigue/twist. Acting is so-so since characters are only revealed as much as this film needs.But overall, it is very entertaining."
4,Cookie-cutter comedy with a heart,"If you can accept the fact that this movie is predictable and appreciate that Gene Hackman and Keanu Reaves carry the dramatic aspect of this movie, you will laugh at the numerous funny scenes in this medium-weight comedy. Yes, it is the classic underdog movie with some sharp comments directed at today's pro athlete millionaires. I enjoy watching this movie and recommend it to any football or sports fan."
4,Great Movie!,"Although we have HD and Blu-Ray, I purchased this regular DVD for my husband. Not the quality, of course, as Blu-Ray, but a really fun movie...the kind you can watch more than once. I mean Keanu Reeves, HD or not!"
2,Love this movie. Shipping sucked.,Love this movie and couldn't wait to watch it. Too bad shipping took 3days longer than it was supposed to. Pretty frustrating.
3,unionism is officially dead in America?,"The hidden meaning in this strike where the rich players were fighting the rich ownerswas that corporations had killed unionism?We get the popular actor Keanu Reeves playing a ""popular"" scab.Since no body won in this fight,and everybody lost, the movie is certainly a type of double think?Below the comedy in reality you have American sweat shops opening in the big citiesat slave wages and illegal alien workers?Laugh at this all you want,you are laughing at the fall of American industry.My Dad and his brothers fought to get a fair living wagefor working men, and like the social security systemthe result today is lost?"
2,"""Bomber crew"" wins again","Another of the genre of ""any group of lovable losers can triumph over anything given the right motivation"" movie.Predictable from the start. I got sucked in because I didn't think Gene Hackman would have become involved in such garbage. He does well- as he always does- but even Sir Lawrence Olivier couldn't have saved this movie."
3,Dated information about recycling and waste management,While my preschooler enjoys this book a lot I have to revise the text quite a bit. Even though it has been revised the information in it seems quite dated. If you are looking for a simple introduction to the concept of recycling it does have great detailed illustrations of various types of recycling.
5,Every day Jobs that interest kids!,"My son, like many curious 5 year olds, enjoys watching the Garbage Truck. And he loves to ask questions such as posed by the book's title, Where Does the Garbage Go?As with most books I have seen in the Let's Read and Find Out Science series, it begins with a story to engage the child in the books primary theme. This one begins in a ""traditional"" classroom setting where the children learn all about garbage from their classroom teacher. It's a great conversation starter with a young child or group of children to ask them where they think the garbage goes.In this book children will learn:1. what garbage is (various types of garbage - yard waste, consumer waste, recycling etc.)2. simple diagrams explain how an incinerator works, how glass, aluminum, paper and plastic is recycled3. the process that transpires at a landfill, which includes bulldozers, compactors and dump trucks (a thrill for my son for sure)4. practical ways to reduce our own garbage"
5,Great informative book!,My 3 year old grandson loves this book. I bought it for him because he loves to watch the garbage truck come by every week. This book really taught him what happens to the garbage after pick-up.
3,Get it from the library,"This is just an ""ok"" book.Trash disposal, composting, and recycling are utterly fascinating to kids, but this book was blah. It was focused more on the fierce urgency of implementing community recycling programs than on the interesting and exciting details of sorting and recycling and landfilling."
4,Too short,"I love this series. It spawned the ""pretty soldier"" genre (Sailor Moon), and then it came back to make fun of its spinoffs.My only real complaint is that after removing the music video collection, it's only 5 episodes long."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as it looks.","The title and the picture on the box gives an impression that it would be very entertaining. No, it's not so much entertaining as it looks. Though it combines 'magical fighting girl', 'sexy red china dress' and 'comedy', the story is poorly designed and the characters are not well developed. Only to be entertaining, it should have been better.But it's not so bad as really stupid OVA animations. I think this animation is worthy of at least 3 stars."
2,Wish CD was feasible,"Yet another corporate conspirators forcing people into listening to headache-inducing distorted MP3 format (over their telephones?) instead of making CD of such great music available. Trying to dumb us down and destroy our ability to hear into the pulse and soul of music, the source material is Excellent. Had to buy LP elsewhere to get acceptable quality of listening!"
5,Emmylou Harris at her best,"Classic Emmylou--the best! I bought this CD to replace one I had lost over a couple moovs. Worth the ""collector's"" pricing. A must for any Emmylou fan."
1,Not the stupidest movie I have ever seen...,"Oh wait, I take that back - it is indeed the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Hey Amazon, I'd like my 99-cent rental fee back, please. I like David Arquette and all, and he plays a perfectly good psycho, but the script was all over the place. There were unnecessary characters and unnecessary scenes, and the stuff that was actually important was constantly in darkness. I have never seen people keep their house lights so dim, or fail to turn on a light when walking in a room. The relationships between characters was needlessly developed since their interaction ended up making no sense in the end. The biggest disappointment was that all the characters don't die as bad as the film. Lastly, I have to question the '5 star' reviewers that raved about it on Amazon - they have to be plants to offer it any credibility."
3,Just Ok,"This movie wasn't bad during the first half. It started out as if it was going to be a great suspenseful, creepy movie. However, it fell apart when we found out about his real home. I phrased it like that because I don't want to give anything away for those that want to watch it. Im glad it was only 99cents, that way I don't feel ripped off."
2,Boring...,This movie was so boring I actually didn't finish watching it. It would be nice if I could get my money back. Spend your money on another movie...
5,My Six-Year-Old and I Enjoyed It,"Like most six-year-olds, my son loves peanut butter. He is also interested in historical figures. Therefore this book--though it's intended for older children--was a perfect fit. My son liked hearing about Carver's travels, the way he overcame obstacles, and how, under pressure, Carver found various uses of peanuts. The story of this great man teaches the importance of determination, grace under pressure, industriousness, patience, and creativity. It inspired my son--and me as well!"
1,Classic Television but too expensive!,"This is television at it's best. Many of the funniest stars of that time, roasting one another. The problem is, the whole set sells for $999. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2726?&tag=shopwiki-us-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325). 27 DVD's and even when purchased individually are $20 a piece + S&H. Why couldn't this have been sold by season with multiple discs at a more reasonable price when compared to other classic TV Shows releases. Classic Television, but a classic rip-off!"
1,Defective VHS,"The picture is wavy and the sound is distorted. Since the cost was only $5.72, itis not worth returning."
4,Don't let the title disuade you!,"Retiring after 28 years as a federal criminal investigator, I obtained a State Private Detective license. I had seen references to this book many years ago and refused to even borrow it from the library. Why? Because any title starting with ""The Complete Idiot's Guide...."" seemed like it would be a superficial joke. Recently, I was going to add to my PI library and read a few of the mostly positive reviews about this book. Long story short, I bought it. Curious,I guess. Surprise! It is very well written and informative. Being a fed (or any LEO) and being a PI are like night and day. I wish I had not been hung up on the title years ago. I had to learn a lot of the differences the hard way."
5,A must read for any private investigator,"Great information in this book,teaches the reader to think outside of the box.The situations addressed are very real,Steve Brown did a great job with this.If you are a private investigator,or are thinking about becoming one,and know you will work a variety of civil cases,its a must read 5 stars all the way"
5,great book,"this is really a antastic book, i' v began reading it and i mnow i know how to leraning so much about PI secrets ands tricks !"
4,Very Imformative,Bought this for my Husband so he could get his PI license. He said it is very informative. He recommends it to any law abiding citizen that may be interested in a career as a PI.
3,Excellent book!,"As a novelist, I found Steve's book very useful in understanding how a protagonist might investigate someone's background or even a crime. As a person who believes that knowledge is truly power, I find it even more useful. Good job."
4,Great - and just what I needed,"This book is exactly what I needed. I'm working on a novel in which my male protagonist is a PI, so I'm devouring all the information Steven Brown has packed into this book. It's a great resource for helping me create a realistic and believable character in an occupation about which I know nothing."
5,Loved it,"Excelent for the beginner , loads of info and easy to read with plenty of refrence material great a must have."
1,Not a strong blender,"I purchased this blender to use on a boat. We tried to make milk shakes with ice cream, and the blender barely had enough power to slightly stir the ice cream. It was completely unable to blend the ice for blended drinks at all. I do not recommend this brand, and I am back to square one to try to find one that will do the job."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for the boat, and was disappointed with the results could not make a smoothie. Ice did not crush small enough"
4,The ending's a little off but overall a good read,"Purists will probably scream until their hair turns white but I thought this was actually a very good yarn. What happened to Heathcliff after he left Wuthering Heights? How did he become the gentleman he returned as?It's a nicely woven tale, tying in how the Bronte sisters conceived their tales and connecting the dots between Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is just plain wicked--the warning he gives Linton against marrying Cathy is absolutely horrifying--and his origins, though predictable after a while, are intriguing.Unfortunately I found it came apart a bit at the end, which after ping-ponging about and even making at attempt to give the fatal romance a happy ending ends on an ambiguous note that left me puzzled."
2,"Review of ""Fine Art of Small-Scale Woodturning""","The Fine Art of small-scale Wooodturning is a pleasant journey both visually and intellectually. Many fine ""small"" turned works are illustrated with superb photography. I found it difficult to learn very much about ""small-turning"" because the author discussed turning in great breadth with little depth. A nice coffee table book with minimal value as a serious reference."
4,Excellent description of Montana ranch life; then and now.,"Dan Aadland's ""Sketches from a Ranch"" creates clear and poignant images of Montana ranch life. Stories which are seasonally related describe how life was for the author's settler relatives as well as his life now, as the keeper of the family ranch. A special interest is placed on horses in these pages and their relationship to the ranch operation and the author's family. The ups and downs associated with equine relationships add texture and light to the real life struggles and pleasures presented here. This is an internal, reflective read which will fuel as well as deflate fantasies of western ranch life. I highly recommend it."
4,SKETCHES FROM THE RANCH,"I loved this book! Being familiar with Montana and the livestock industry this is one of the most heartwarming, well written stories I've had the pleasure of reading. From the 'old days'to the modern ways of ranch life and all the diversities. When you finish this book you know Dan Aadland and his life and love of ranching, his horses, cattle and Montana. Every chapter of this book is a good tale. Anyone who loves the lifestyle will be charmed and inspired by Dan Aadlands relationship with his animals and even his pick-up and tractor. His well educated prose and wit makes this book a joy to read. The art work throughout the book, Sketches From The Ranch, adds a wonderful visual that validates life on the ranch."
1,much to thick,I was very disappointed with this product. the ring setting is so high all the way around that you cannot close your fingers comfortably.
2,"A good idea, but, but, but. . . .","I sent this back to Amazon. It wasn't Amazon's failure, it was Rubbermaid's. The shrink wrap on this was so tight, it warped the tray; it didn't sit flat in the drawer and the top tray didn't sit properly on the bottom one. This was a total failure of quality control at Rubbermaid. The only reason I gave it two stars was that the tray really was a good idea, and if it had been packaged more carefully by Rubbermaid, it would have been a big help to me in my kitchen with limited drawer space. Rubbermaid usually doesn't let me down, so I was surprised to be let down on this."
2,Disappointed,"Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't fit my silverware.The top doesn't slide if you fill the bottom with a set of twelve pieces."
5,"""Homecoming"" deserves to be in your home!","""The Homecoming"" is DS9's 2nd Season premiere. Kira goes on a mission to rescue an old Bajorian war-hero from the occupation, Li Nalas. The action-rescue scene is riveting, but better than that--it is action with a purpose! When Li returns to the station, an interesting discussion between Li and Sisko occurs about the nature of legends. Sisko needs Li to bring stability to the political situation of Bajor, but Li does not deserve to be a legend. This is part 1 of a 3 part story. It will certainly be enjoyed!"
5,a classic for all who know,"Does this album really need ANOTHER review? I think not. Anyone who is buying this album is aware of who these jazz giants are indeed. As a bass player, I collect and enjoy any and every recording I can find featuring Anthony Jackson. His rhythm section work is unparalleled and always inspiring. His tone alone is worthy of your sonic sampling.The album is a mix of timelessly, elegant offerings along with more aggressive works reminiscent of 90's fusion. Overall, a joy to listen to and learn from as a must buy."
5,what you need to know when you bring your preemie home,"This is an excellent book, with information on the everything you could possibly ask about caring for your preemie, even if it weighs more than my preemie did at birth! Drs. Stein and Davis have spent hours interviewing families of preemies and the real-life illustrations are wonderful ways to make our issues seem real and manageable!"
5,A wonderful new resource for the parents healing,"This is a must have for parents of preemies. There is much to learn medically to care for them, but even more to learn for parents to cope. I have been raising a preemie for 8 years it is a welcome addition to my collection! In the pages you find companionship. The authors have been there,and it shows. The parent quotes bring a sense of belonging and the realization that others have survived and you can too. A wonderful book to buy for yourself if you have a preemie, or for friends or family to buy for others who have. Absolutely wonderful!"
5,You'll be laughing for days!!,"If you are looking for a good lightweight comedy that doesn't stoop to the lowest common denomenator for laughs then this is the one.I haven't been this surprised by a movie since ""Ferris Beuller's day off"". One of the funniest movies I have ever seen and will have you laughing histerically for days afterwards."
4,Good Movie!!!,"Forget what the so-called ""pros"" rated or rather under rated this movie. It's great movie! I laughed the whole time and it was $$ well spent. Tinker, Junior, & Earl were non-stop. Waiting for a sequel just to see Tinker stalk and finally shoot Earl..."
3,"the first five minutes were great, and then... kaboom",the only thing funny about this movie was the pizza delivery guy robbery.
1,"sorry, think its a disappointment.","I was recommended this movie by two friends, in this recommendation they acted out a certain part of the movie which caused me to laugh but when I saw the movie, It didnt tickle my fancy. I would of been better off just having my friends re tell the parts, cause they verison surely is more funny than what was really acted out. Needless to say, I got about half way through the movie and didnt finish it as of yet, its just sitting around on the shelf collecting dust, which is more than it deserves."
2,Terribly boring and unfunny,"I found this movie extremely dull and laughed exactly one time. The ""comedy,"" if you really want to call it that, is beyond juvenile... and not even the funny juvenile humor that makes other movies good. Overused accents are very rarely funny, especially when they're so over accentuated (like in this film) that it gets to be annoying. How so many people liked this movie is beyond me, but it makes me think about how bad society is becoming."
1,I really cant tell you yet....,I ordered this product on march 11 with the estimated arrival date being the 21 and Im still wating on it and its the 31 I know it some times takes a while but I thought it would arrive a little more timely.
4,The Best Unkinown Comedy of 2002,"Lone Star State Of Mind is an intelligent and hysterical comedy. Joshua Jackson as well as Ryan Hurst kept me laughing throughout the entire movie. If you are a fan of quirky comedy this film will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Interesting, original, and by far one of the best movies to come out of 2002."
4,Lonestar Movie,"This movie has that football guy from ""Blue Crush,"" the skinny kid from ""Road Trip,"" that chick from ""Pearl Harbor"" who use to be on MTV when she went by a guy's name, and Pacey. This is almost a Teen movie, but not quite. Entertaining and worth your time, though you may want to rent it before you buy it. Still a good movie."
1,New Tools for the 20th Century,"Helpful look at the usefulness of technology in the life of the church, but seems to be about ten to fifteen years behind."
2,YUK,"Never Again. Through Amazon, I bought a Paloma Picasso perfume package that was shipped from a company, Beauty Encounter-from California. When I received the perfume package, I opened it but it didn't smell ""right"". I've used Paloma Picasso for YEARS and I KNOW what it smells like! Per the enclosed instructions, I called the company to register my concerns and ask if the perfume was ""too old"" and could theyjust ship me another bottle of it and I'd be happy to return the one they sent me. The woman on their end of the phone was very combative and condescending. She told me that it was NOT too old and that I obviously didn't know what it was supposed to smell like and she couldn't do anything about it. After I begged her, she said she'd have the warehouse manager contact me the following day, which, to this day, I have never heard from. That was at least 1 month ago."
1,Damaged/unacceptable merchandise received,The product i ordered was opened and it looked like someone had destroyed it on purpose. i felt horrible for the person i gave it to because it didn't look like a gift!! really disappointing!
5,Nokia 5100/6100 Vibrating Slim Extended Litum-Ion Battery,"Excellent price, excellent battery, and extremely fast delivery. I will tell everyone I know that uses a Nokia 5100/6100 cell phone. I talked numerous times today for quite awhile. The battery still shows full charge."
2,"Better Than Nothing - Good Start, Needs Work","As a beginning student of Kazakh, I find the book only marginally useful. There appears to be a fairly high number of errors (I usually find out in class when I am corrected by my Kazakh teacher!). I've also found it lacking in its depth of coverage, causing me to default to a pocket Kazakh-Russian/Russian-Kazakh dictionary I picked up along the way.On a positive note, the author was breaking relatively new ground (in 1994), so it is only right to compliment his efforts. But come on, it's been 11 years since its publishing! Isn't there anyone out there to continue the work? It begs for a revision (of its errors), an update (inclusion of new words/phrases), and an English-Kazakh section (reverse look-up).Only barely adequate. I would have preferred to give it 2 1/2 stars..., but that choice was not available."
1,This Digital Book Incomplete,This book only includes 3 of the Darby O'Gill stories--it is missing several others that are included in the public domain edition.
3,"Review of W.I.T.C.H. #4 by Julia, a 9 year old girl","This book was pretty good, and had a good ending. In the previous book, Taranee gets herself locked in a bubble to save the rest of the Guardians. They come to Meridian to save her, only to discover that she'd already melted it. Elyon and Cedric were pretty surprised at that. I didn't care for the way that a lot of the book was centered around Taranee, and that Cornelia kept saying that she should be leader, not Will. I don't blame W.I.T.C.H. for doing so much for Taranee, because they probably missed her. If I were a Guardian, I would do the same for a member of the group."
5,Native American style life-lesson qualities showcased,"A faculty member of the University of Wisconsin and the College of the Menominee Nation, as well as the author of seven previous and well received collections of poetry, Grandmother Says is J. D. Whitney's latest anthology of original and memorable verse. The poems comprising Grandmother Says are each hallmarked by a buoyant, joyous, energetic, Native American style life-lesson qualities showcased in an especially quick-minded fashion. Grandmother says sometimes nothing./But/what/others say/she/says back to them/again/if/she likes it./Why Owl/ hears Echo Woman's/song/more/than people do./Why Wolf/does too."
4,Very Informative Book,"Of the books I've read about eating disorders, this is probably the most informative one regarding explanations of what eating disorders are. This is an excellent resource for anyone with a young child or teenager with an eating disorder. I did find their advice about leaving your job to stay home with your child or going to their school to eat with them to be a bit impractical, but overall think the book is a valuable resource."
3,From a parent of a child with an eating disorder,"This is a good book if you want to educate yourself on Anorexia Nervosa and the various types of treatments. The authors fail to go into enough detail about the in hospitalization programs or the residential programs. It would have been helpful to include a list of important questions to ask when touring these facilities. Also, the family based method needed to be much more in depth. What to do when...., where should the family members sit in order to be the most effective, etc."
5,Las 20 mejores de Sandro,"Este CD ha sido remasterizado de las cintas originales en 20 Bit High Definition Sound y las canciones que tiene son: 1) Quiero llenarme de ti. 2) Porque yo te amo. 3) Una muchahcha y una guitarra. 4) Querida. 5) Tengo. 6) Penumbras. 7) Rosa..Rosa. 8) Asi. 9) Noche de amantes. 10) Pobre mi madre querida. 11) Trigal. 12) Como lo hice yo. 13) Dame el fuego de tu amor. 14) Ave de paso. 15) Guitarras al viento. 16) Despu?s de la guerra. 17) La vida continua. 18) Las manos. 19) Como te dire. 20) Voy a abrazarme a tus pies.Para los coleccionistas, este CD est? fuera de cat?logo."
3,Okay book,"It's very useful to have the words listed by frequency. This way you can learn the most common words quickly. However, I find it annoying that none of the principal parts or alternate spellings are listed. Homer tends to use a lot of alternative spellings and it'd be more useful if the book told you what they were. A good dictionary would be a better purchase."
3,Not As Described,"This battery was not in ""Motorola retail packaging"" as described - it came in a generic clear plastic bag. And from the charge it holds it appears not to be new, either, but you get what you pay for, I guess. For the price it wasn't worth it to complain to the company or anything, but buyer beware..."
1,Not as Described,"It did not arrive in ""Motorola Retail Packaging"" as advertised, but merely clad in a plastic sleeve. As a result, I have no way of knowing if it was new or not. The charge does not seem to last as long as the original battery did when I first bought my phone, leaving me very suspicious of the seller. A disappointment."
1,Motorola Br50 Battery,"I don't understand why this type of battery takes almost eight hrs to charge. Before I order the new replacement battery, the old battery that I was using has been charging the same way. Can someone tell me why? I had other cell phones in the past, but those batteries did not take all day to charge up."
2,Low battery life: are these re-furbished??,"The extremely low price from Eforcity attracted me to buy this battery, but when I started using it, it has a very low battery life. I have to charge it every 1-2 days after talking on the phone for about an hour. Are these batteries re-furbished??"
3,Wrong product; can't review correctly,"I have contacted customer service three times regarding this order. I ordered the Kitten Kaboodle, but received the Kit and Kaboodle, intended for adult cats. The first contact I told customer service I would keep the product since I could use it, but asked about the KITTEN KABOODLE for a just weaned kitten. I received word back to contact the manufacturer. Why should I do that? There was nothing wrong with the product; just the wrong one. Everything had said Kitten; order verification, invoice, picture in the cat food section. I didn't receive a response to the other two messages I left. I finally decided it was someone's mistake and checked again. Again the picture shows the Kitten Kaboodle, so I ordered again, and everything I received showed Kitten. I received it today, and again it is the regular adult food. I had always received good service with Amazon, and I am very disappointed with this."
3,"Good cd, but disappointing sacd.","I've always liked this cd so I bought the Mobil Fidelity SACD and it is a disappointment. The sound is not much of an improvement over the regular cd, which is unusual, SACD is usually much better, but there are exceptions."
5,Erase your mistakes !,"If you have a brother typewriter or a compatible unit for these lift off correction tapes, then this is an essential item. You can buy the knock off ones online, but this buyer was reliable and the merchandise was exactly what I ordered. A great purchase, a must really, because it erases every mistake that you make...granted if you are typing ncr paper might be a challenge, it will only erase over what's on the top copy. However, I highly recommend you get this...believe me if only all life's past mistakes could be erased as easily... I'll be the first in line for this sort of thing,,,, oh, the angst of prom night....what I'd give to erase my date! Yes Mom I should have gone with Dad, at least he was taller :)"
1,Missing item,"I purchased this item. The delivery time was past 5 days from what I was told, then when I went to track it, it says in transit for numerous days. When I did eventually receive it, one item was missing. Will never order from this company again"
5,The definitive Bluebeard,"Though we are fortunate to have several recordings of Bela Bartok's sole opera ""Bluebeard's Castle"" on CD today, this old 1990 recording with Kertesz conducting the huge orchestral sound of the LSO to join with Walter Berry's and Christa Ludwig's impeccable characterizations is still the best available. The other worldly sounds of the opening of each of the seven doors in the darkly sinister castle that will be the home for yet another wife for Bluebeard continue to create sublime illusions of every scene described. Richly sung and passionately conducted, don't let the age of this recording deter you adding it to your collection. Excellent on every level. Even the sonics sound completely modern! Grady Harp, June 12"
5,This is exactly what I wanted,I wanted the original cord - to match my kirby. The price was lower than a generic cord and it was mailed right out too. I was happy with the whole experience.
3,it's alright... Not as good as i thought it would be.,"well, i like it, but i tought there would be a lot more hard rap and hip-hop. But thats not the case. i'll chart some of the songs down...1. Do or Die: O.K, they don't do a lot of singin, it more of just playin music. i giv it a 3 star...2.CMC's meet OGG's: it's a little bit betta then the first one but not that great...3. Gospel Gangsta Voyage: its pretty good.4. Y can't da Homiez Hear Me?: its not that bad.. & its not that good either :-/5. Gospel Gangsta Thang: (to me) it sounds like an ""older song""6. Mobbin: kinda boring, not really that cool7. Tears of a Black Man: it's a good song.. just the guys don't sing hardly @ all..8. Testimony: its not bad...9. Before Redemption: its a preatty cool song.10.The Holy Terra: after u think the song is over, wait for a while, something else will play... its ok"
1,fake Gospel Gangstas album. Worst ever.,"This album is just awful. Every remix is far worse than the original, and they cut a lot of the most powerful lyrics. When I first listened to it, I was surprised the double G's would put out an album this bad.Turns out, they didn't. KMG made the remixes from the original recordings without any involvement from the artists themselves.Don't buy this album."
1,"Do not by this album. Buy ""I can see clearly now""","The album is a hot mess. Maybe others can get down with it but not me. I have been a fan for a long time, I have this original GG Tape...4 real.. Now that was a good album. I bought this cd because I wanted to listen to this album, but I no longer have a tape player. This album must be some type of remix or something. The song titles are the same as the tape I own, but everything else changed. I am extremely dissapointed in the production. The beats are horrible. This is not a typical GG album, I have 3 or 4 of them, and they all sound a heaven of a lot better than this one. This album is way out of their character. KMG or whoever you are, I suggest you getting some feedback from the OGG audience before selling nonsense like this.If you need help with production, holla at me.God Bless, Gospel Gangstaz, keep doing your thing. Get at me!!Let's let the world know who the one and only true and living God is."
3,its a remix cd with no real message..,i kind of got into the music. it was different and something to listen to when i got tired of listening to anything else. i have Gang Affilitated and I Can See Clearly Now and DJ Doves first (if not only) release. I do have one concern about this cd and thats the hidden song after Testimony. you have to wait maybe 30 seconds of silence before you hear it. it makes no sense and makes you wonder WHO was behind the making of this cd. if you havent heard it check it out.
5,A Nice Purchase,"I must take a second to commend this book. The real power of this book is not so much what's in the book, but how it's represented - how Schonbrun teaches it. In reaction to the review below, most guitar players like myself struggle with modes, scales, chord origins and such - regardless of how many books I read. If you already ""get"" these topics, few books if any will help you as you are in the minority. The reality is that the largest group of guitar players in this world do not have a clear understanding of how the guitar works and this is where this title excels. Explanations are clear, the tone is friendly and most important of all, he helps you understand it in your own way. I have learned much from this book and I will continue to do so for a long time. I recommend it highly to anyone you wants to advance their skills on the instrument they love so much!"
2,Ok... BUT!,"To tell the truth, 2 stars is a little harsh of a rating for this book. It's really ok. I'd think it would be good for raw beginners. I'd just like to tone down the hyper exuberance I'm seeing in the reviews so far. When people gush about how it's ""good for anyone"" and imply all levels of players can benefit from it... that's a little overboard as far as I'm concerned and I'd like people with a little experience who are looking for ""WOW"" instructional packages to be warned. I've only been playing the guitar for about three years and I've seen everything in the book elsewhere, including freely available on the web. If you already know how chords are built, basic chord progressions, your Major and minor scales and the modes derived there from... and your pentatonic scales, I'd suggest you move on to the playing type of books. I've enjoyed the ""Blues You Can Use"" series and the packages by Troy Stetina."
3,Good Book,"I have a stack of guitar books and magazines and have found that interest in the instrument and practicing the right scales, chords, and just time invested is the best way to go. This is a decent book."
1,they advertise 2nd edition... but deleiver the older one,i have the older edition. i purchased again to tget the desription of 2nd edition. now i have two of the same book!!! no update!
5,Our daughter won't turn it off!,"We went to see the actual show in January and our daughter loved it, so we picked this up. She has watched it 3-4 times a day since. Sure the puppeteers make some mistakes and you can tell that they are puppets, but isn't that the point? Bear's strings always show even on TV. Bottom line is that this DVD has everything that makes Bear has been the one show or character that she hasn't outgrown or gone through a phase of not caring about."
3,"thorough text, not the most reader friendly","This book was required for a Groundwater Contaminant Transport class I'm taking. It is very thorough in it's scope and gives a lot of details overall. My complaint about it is that it is very inconsistent with its notation of equations, etc. ie: it will be talking about the same thing but using different notations and it seems they are different concepts. This book is written from a geologist perspective and not so much an engineering perspective (what I am). It assumes an in depth understanding of geochemistry. One good thing is it has some of the answers in the back."
4,Is it really non-stop?......Word!,"Im sure at this point, there's about 100 ""old school"" rap compilations out there, but as far as I can tell, this is one of the best. It's from the era after early 80's breakdance rap, and before the early 90's gangsta rap. When you got ""Jump"", ""It's Tricky"", and ""It Takes Two"" on one disc, you know it's good. Plus ""Humpty Dance"", ""O.P.P."", and ""Me Myself and I"". This would be the bomb if it included ""Set Adrift on Memory Bliss"", ""I got a Man"", and ""Bust a Move"", but no. This also comes in a 2-cd set, but the best of that is all here. Another great collection is ""Millennium Hip-Hop Party"". It's just as dope."
3,Hip Hop Non Stop cd,I was really confused when I recieved this cd it had a mixture of all!! Not just hip hop!! This cd also had r&b and different types of music at first it threw me off but than I got used to whatever songs that did play when I got my cd it was scratched from this seller so other than that yes it was ok cd but nothing I would ever recommend to friends. KC.
5,wow...,"These songs slip under the protective barriers we all wear and transmit pure heartfelt emotions. The songs are catchy, the lyrics carry weight despite their lightness, the singer's voice is soothing, and the total effect is amazing.Buy the album! You won't regret it."
5,The Jayhawks are incredible...,"The Jayhawks are one of my favorite bands and when I heard that Olson had left the group I was very skeptical of how this album would sond. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know how they did it, but they did. It is the best thing they have ever done (well, maybe tied for best with Tommorrow, the Green Grass).Everyone should write them a letter so they will continue to record, and Dammit start buying some of their albums!"
2,A self indulgent trip down mid-tempo lane,"Mark Olson left the band, and this is what was left. There are some fine songs on this record , but they are few and far between - and compared to previous Jayhawks efforts, it is quite inferior.The last track, the Sound of Lies, is a classic, as is Bottomless Cup. The Man Who Loved Life is also a nice song.However, there are far too many slef indulgent mid tempo snoozers on this record. Louris is a great talent, but it appears his judgement on this record wasn't fine tuned.I really dislike to say it, but this record belongs next to all Izzy Stradlin's solo , Filter, and 4 Non-Blondes cd's at the used cd stores."
5,P.L. Whitney depicts small-town life with wit and poignancy.,"In small-town Missouri during the '60s,Graceanne survives disasters such as floods and physical abuse through her keen intelligence and wit. Her persistence is reflected in her book, a treasure that Charlie, her devoted brother, helps her to protect.Through Charlie, the narrator, the reader gains multifaceted layers of understanding that embrace humor and pain, and I for one laughed aloud and wept in equal measure.P.L. Whitney has crafted a lyrical tribute to a troubled family. To Kill a Mockingbird is in the same league. Whitney, however, confronts behavior that is almost too unbearable to mention."
5,The way the hymns should be done,In many churches today the rich hymnody of the past has been replaced by Christian pop and simplistic choruses. Hymns seem old and stodgy. Not so the hymns on this album. This is the way the hymns should be heard in praise to God.
3,Defective Model,"When this item works it works fine. Note that the heart rate recovery function is pretty much a useless feature on this model. It is really only an effective tool when you are doing sprints and since this model does not do splits it makes the additional feature pointless. The only real difference between this and the Fusion 20 is the calorie counter. In hindsight, I would either go with one of the cheaper Fusions or upgrade to the GT series.My big gripe is that I got a defective model and I have had to replace the battery in the transmitter three times in the last three months. Not good. I have contacted Cardiosport. I will post how they deal with this issue."
2,This method of instruction just does not work.,"I will post this to the first four books of the series, which I bought all at once.I was hoping this series, as popular as it seems to be, would be the Go equivalent of Yasser Seirawan's ""Play Winning Chess,"" but this series has nothing in comparison. I agree with other reviews that describe the books' lack of depth. There is actually so little information presented in the first four volumes, that they might as well be combined into one book for the same price as one of the books. There are also glaring typographical errors throughout every copy.Don't let the glossy covers fool you, in my opinion, this book series is nothing but a money grab. (This volume would be a great accomplishment, if it were 1000 pages longer...Most of the book lightly brushes upon the life and death of stones, but in doing it so lightly, it really does not convey any worthwhile information for playing the game)"
2,simply not good,"The cover of the CD is deceiving. While you expect Ice T rhyming, he only does so in track #1. Other than that, I expected a better production by Ice T and DJ Aladdin (the effort is good though)"
4,Super Sonic Jay Jay,Our 2 1/2 year old saw one episode of Jay Jay on TLC and couldn't stop talking about it. We got him the Super Sonic Jay Jay stories and he loves it. It contains three simple 10 minute episodes--each with it's own basic message. Highly recommended.
2,Another Jay Jay video that will have your kids snoring!,"I got several Jay Jay videos from the library where I work, expecting a cute show for my kids. Instead, I found that they are all pretty stupid! Some of the episodes try to teach a good lesson, but the plotlines are misguided and lame.On this tape, Jay Jay gets very egotistical and endangers his cargo in the name of going as fast as possible. In my opinion this teaches kids a very bad lesson. This and other dumb stories make this a barely watchable video by kids and adults alike."
3,What Was This?,"Patrick Bateman is a wealthy New Yorker with a penchant for sex and killing people. The characters were very annoying. There were chapters on the music of Genesis, Whitney Houston, and Huey Lewis and the News, and I don't know what they had to do with the story. There wasn't a conclusive ending. What the hell was this? (B)"
2,disjointed,"I found this writing to be so disjointed I often found myself having to re read paragraphs. I found it very difficult to follow. As a young girl I felt sympathy for Karen Morgan, however, I found her so unlikaeble by midway through the book I only finished it to see if she ever came around and redeemed herself. What a pathetic woman. I'm hoping Tara continues to move on."
3,Average,"There were a few phrases that I enjoyed, particularly, ""my sweetness is thin and brittle, like a candy coating."" But, for the most part, I found the chapters disjointed between her immediate memoirs and history of Hawaii. The connections she intended to make between the two were fragile and disjointed."
3,"Some style, but rough around the edges","Supersonic Storybook starts off real well with ""The Kids Are Insane"". When King says ""Can ya hear me U.O.?"" you know they have some style and confidence. Songs like ""Candidate"" ""What Is Artane?"", and ""Vacation In Tokyo"" aren't bad, but the muddy singing and playing undercut the songs. ""Emmaline"" is a decent slower song. ""Blackie's Birthday"" and ""Henhough"" are basically novelty songs. ""Bionic Revolution"" is a fun (mostly) instrumental, and ""Navajo"" is a more thoughtful (mostly) instrumental to close the album out. It's not bad, but the best is yet to come from this trio."
4,great album,"This is well worth listening to, like most of UO's material. The Hot Chocolate cover is worth the price alone."
1,There's A Reason Nobody's Heard Of Indie Bands.,"This record is horrific. I got it more to be a completist after loving their more polished, later stuff. Most of it is unlistenable (""Emmaline"" is OK). After reading about all the ""controversy"" within the indie community when UO left to make professional recordings, I concluded that it's all jealousy. If the hippies could make professional records like ""Saturation"" (or even ""Exit the Dragon"", although that one's not fantastic either) they all would. If they say they wouldn't, they're lying or delusional."
2,"No standouts, indian drumming?",Love UO but they went the wrong way with this record. None of the songs really stand out and then the album descends into a some kind of a Powwow at the end. Didn't last long in my truck at all.
3,"Doesn't trim nails, but my birds still like it.","I was kind of upset because the claim that it trims nails has proven to be false. My cockatiel has razor-sharp nails, even after having this in her cage for about a month now. But even if it doesn't work well to trim nails, she still does seem to like the perch. I see it on her often, and I'm glad she likes it. It's a very nice-looking perch, and I prefer it to a wooden dowel like I'm used to because it's a ton easier to clean. It might not be worth the money but I am glad that I have it."
2,"too heavy, sags on cage","It is a pretty heavy perch, the washers should have been bigger to help distribute the weight across the cage wires."
5,"Right size , right material","Well made, easy to put in the cage, amd my bird likes it. So I recommend for all bird pets"
5,Excellent perch,I should have bought the smaller size but these are outstanding perches that will make your baby's beak really sharp!
4,good price for money,doesnt really use it to sharpen but is very long lasting for my bird (cocktoo) who chews everything lol will buy more in future
3,To heavy,"The carry on is nice, the problem is that is kind of heavy and I was expecting something smaller and more easy to carry, but a very good material."
3,I thought it was just O.K.,"I originally picked this up because it had The Roc Project ""Deja'vu"" a favourite of mine. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the highlights of this cdDavid Guetta ""Just a little more love""Mynt feat. Kim Sozzi ""How did you know?""Allie ""Can't Go On""Shapeshifters ""Lola's Theme""See Alice feat. Simon Luca ""Vision of love""These are great songs but after them, the cd goes to hell. It just doesn't keep up with these songs, the rest of the album seems to fall apart because the music doesn't keep the vibe that these songs have. E.g. Kylie's ""Red blooded woman"" remix is just horrible, and Daft Punk's ""One more time"" shouldn't even be in this collection because it's just too old. I would recommend the ""Ministry of Sound annual 2005"" cd instead of this."
4,Charming if a bit lightweight,"A slim volume full of photos, this is a nice little addition to your coffee table or art-crit collection. Sister Wendy analyzes porcelain figures of the Muses and Apollo, making them come to life as you learn what to look for and read her interpretations of them. The photography is simply gorgeous and it's worth buying just for that. Sister Wendy's analysis of the figures is full of her usual insight, and free of the condescension one might fear from a religious person discussing pagan deities. But then again, the Muses have become part of the secular culture and are everywhere in our language (amuse, bemuse, museum), so they're fitting topics for any discussion of our culture. Be warned, though, as you may feel motivated to start collecting porcelain figures yourself..."
4,Excellent pack -- strong characters for gameplay!,"I would suggest Heroscape to any one who loves strategy board games and/or fantasy roleplay games. I am a 20-year-old college student, and I love it. I think everyone could have fun with it. As for this particular set, it offers five of the strongest and most useful characters for gameplay, so I would suggest it for anyone who plays Heroscape competitively or with friends!"
5,"Another fine addition to the ""Best of Watercolor"" series","This is another impressive collection of superb watercolors. The editor has consistently gathered together quality, well-crafted paintings in all of the ""Best of Watercolor"" series books. It is not only a useful tool for the artist who is trying to work on the area of composition, but is also simply a beautiful collection of watercolors, which are diverse, rich, and a joy to view."
4,great product,reasonable pad. I use it about 20 hrs for now and it is OK. Will post if something wrong happens
2,Low expectations,"When I bought this, I had some fair expectations. The only thing this dance pad met was that it had a wire that could connect to my PS2 and that it wouldn't slide around.The pad itself is VERY crinkly and it seems almost baggy, like there's an excess amount of nylon-plastic. The good news is, it's slightly thicker than the regular thin plastic dance pads (the red-pink-blue ones)Unfortunately, it makes a loud crinkly noise - similar that of a diaper made from wrapping paper.The box says ""more sensitive"" so you're ""less likely to miss"" but it's a bit TOO sensitive. The arrows extend a little farther into the center, so even if you stand in the middle, you're likely to hit a button that you don't want to hit.If you're a beginner and you don't have any expectations for a dance pad or you'd like a durable dance pad that's better than the thinner ones - then you should buy this pad.But for 14.99, you should be reminded that your expectations shouldn't be very high."
4,A better DDR pad,"While this pad is slightly smaller than the pad that comes with some DDR games, the buttons are certainly more accurate and dependable. The bottom side has a little more traction than the cheap pad as well but I still found it will move around a bit. Overall, a good pad and definitely recommended for those who play DDR a little more than just casually."
5,"Good pad, cheap","The Red Octane pad has met all my expectations. Compared to the Pelican dance pad we have, it has a thicker foam core and is much more responsive. The only thing our Pelican has that is better is the fact that it can be used for all game platforms. This is a great pad for those who are just starting out and an excellent choice if you want to modify it. Once you begin playing DDR with a passion you have to modify these kinds of pads in order to get high scores. Modifying just involves attaching it to a hard surface (plywood) and then covering with a clear plastic such as a shower curtain liner."
3,Mediocre dance pad,"We bought this dance pad so that we would have an additional pad with our DDR game (which came with one dance pad controller). However, this pad is smaller than the standard one that came with our game, so it's a little harder to dance on. Whenever we play it's usually a race to see who can get to the other pad first, so that you're not stuck wtih this one. It's also very sensitive (maybe b/c it is small) and so when you are picking your song and setting up the game you cannot stand in the center of the mat b/c it still picks up your feet as trying to select something by touching the arrows when you have not moved from the center."
4,dance on,"I've been using this dance pad for almost a month now, and it still works just fine. I am not an expert DDR player, so I would only recommend this dance pad if you're just playing for fun or want a good work out. But if you're a serious DDR player, I would recommend some other dance pad because this one isn't very sensitive to your stepping, which lowers your game score because it didn't catch you stepping on the corresponding arrow."
1,Holy Moly!,"This has to be a joke! I can not fathom how anyone would want to slaughter good music like that. These samples are HORRIFYING!Please, just go buy a copy or a second copy of the real thing."
1,This isn't a Best Of...,"When I saw this, I thought it was a ""Best Of"" CD. At closer inpsection, it's a cheap imitation. If you want the Goo Goo Dolls, buy the real thing. And as one other review stated, its a shame you can't give a rating of less then (1)"
1,Why bother when you can get the real thing!?!?1,"Why would you bother to buy this CD when you can buy the real thing. It sounds like this so called ""Tribute"" album is just a [copy]from the GOO GOO DOLLS. I guess this [copycat] band couldn't make it with their own music so they had to [copy] the Goos. Don't bother!!"
1,-bangs head against wall repeatedly.-,"Just listening to the 30 second samples of these ""covers"" made me want to smash that CD up. And I dont even own it! If I could give this record a negative amount of stars, I would. Don't get me wrong, the Goos are the best band ever, but, please! How could they have let someone make this album?! Wait, they prolly didn't even get a licensed. Heck, even ex-Goo's-drummer George Tutuska sings better on the song ""22 Seconds"" (Hold Me Up, 1990) than this guy. Ugh. Don't waste your time!"
1,Most Expensive Drink Coaster Ever!,"Not 30 seconds after I put this into my stereo did all the dogs in the neighborhood start howling. After a minute my ears started bleeding. Within two minues the cops were banging at my door and threatened to arrest me for acts of terrorism, disturbing the peace and assault with a deadly weapon. I thought I was safe when I handed it over to the cops but it was too late! The angry mob from Frankenstein's castle was already on their way down the street. I am now in the witness protection program. Save your cash and don't let this happen to you!"
2,At least their hearts were in the right place...,"I bought this album because I think John Rzeznik's songwriting is the best I've ever heard. I was disappointed with what I heard from these guys. The main problem with it is that they don't try anything different with the music, which is basically the point of tribute cds. But you won't hear any acoustic orchestrated version of Big Machine or punk rock version of Iris on here. All you get is a 3rd-rate attempt by these guys to reproduce some of the Goo's hits. I agree with the other people that I could for a fact do a better job with a tribute cd, as I've played a number of Goo Goo Dolls songs for crowds and actually get a good response...unlike this cd. The only reason I give this 2 stars is that they cited a pizza place and beer in their thank yous."
1,"Can we say ""plagiarism?!""","What a bunch of ...?! I don't care know what people were thinking when they thought this was a great tribute album but like one of the people who reviewed it said ""why buy a tribute when you can buy the real one?!"" I couldn't say it better myself. This CD sounds like someone recorded a bunch of people singing Goo songs at karaoke! If I was a bonafide capitalists, I could of recorded myself singing and released it as a tribute album. No originality whatsoever and how disrespectful to the Goos!!"
2,Hattie McDaniel,"A biography that was interesting in some spots, long and boring in others. I came away from this one with an ""oh, well"" kind of feeling. While I appreciated the author's fact based account, I was never able to really ""get into"" this story. McDaniel came from a life of extreme poverty to become the first Black person to win an Academy Award. The book goes into great detail about McDaniel's life story, her parentage, her work in vaudeville, her work on screen and on radio. We also read about her multiple marriages, her fight with the NAACP and her last days as she fought diabetes and breast cancer. The running theme of this book is courage and perserverance, of which Ms. McDaniel had a lot. I wouldn't recommend this for purchase, best to get it from the library. 2.5 stars."
5,I love Hattie,This has got to be one of the best books written about someone. The book is well written and an enjoyment to read. I hope all get a chance to read such a book. thank you.
1,Half of the word count consists of one word - racism.,Get this one from the library. It's more of a history of racism (as defined by the author) than of the great Hattie McDaniel. Hardly a sentence is written throughout the whole thing that doesn't remind the reader that there are racial differences and history behind it.
4,Interesting,"The author makes the actress more complex (and lovely) then I think she actually was, but it is interesting, light reading for a rainy afternoon."
1,Save Your Money,"I was looking forward to reading an in-depth biography of Miss McDaniel - this wasn't it. Very dry reading, and for some reason the author felt the need to use the subject's full name in every sentence. If you didn't know who you were reading about just by the title of the book, you would certainly be sure of it by the end of the first chapter. By the end of the book, you were sick to death of the name Hattie McDaniel. Definitely written by a teacher, not an author who had any interest at all in her subject. A truly boring book."
5,Tejano masterpiece,"Les Blank and Chris Strachwitz are national treasures. They have a way of taking seemingly mundane footage and turning it into a life-changing experience without injecting any personal commentary. Chulas Fronteras is a film that stays in the mind long after viewing, because it is not just about a culture, but about what it means to be human among fellow humans. See it if you love Tejano music and culture. See it if you don't know anything about Tejano music and culture. See it even if you think you don't like Tejano music and culture, because you will still learn something from it."
4,OK - I was wrong,For twenty years I thought that this was the album that killedThe Ramones. It's not. It's actually very good - just different. I guess it's like when Bob Dylan went electric - some of us just were not ready for it at the time. The Ramones didn't sell out - they made a great record with Phil Spector who took them to places they hadn't been to before. Listen-enjoy!
3,"Great Potential, But It Didn't Work","This could have been a contender on paper with a legendary band working with a legendary producer. Sorry to say, it didn't work out. The first three songs are among the best the group has ever recorded. After that, the project runs out of gas and the famous Wall of Sound approach begins to sound like a chore."
2,what a disaster!,"Only Phil Spectar could kill a Ramones record. Bad idea, still bad. The Ramones are my favorite band, have been for years. I own all of their albums, and play, wear-out, and rebuy all of the albums. From ""Ramones"" to ""Mondo Bizzaro"". But this album, the only one, I never pick up to play. I have it on vinyl, from the early 80s, its the olny one I did'nt replace to cd.Over produced, horn sections, wall-of-sound? Hello! Three cords, four leather jackets, a grimy club and a thousand fans was the magic. Not trying to find where to put keyboards into a Ramones album. I hate to blast a Ramones record, but buy another one, any one. You'll be much happier."
4,Middle-Age Crisis?,"After four albums of slash-and-burn buzzsaw pyrotechics, all layered with pure pop sensibility, 1980's ""End Of The Century"" saw da bruddahs Ramone' Wall Of Noise battle producer Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound to a virtual draw, and Joey's aspirations for pop success finish in a dead heat with Johnny's staunch punk populism. Although Spector's production is a muddy sounding hit-and-miss affair when applied to Marshalls and black leather, with individual instruments indistinguishable on some tracks, the band's signature air wreck sound shines through on stormers like ""I'm Affected,"" ""I Can't Make It On Time,"" and ""This Ain't Havana."""
2,Production matters,"Phil Spector should have been on trial for murder years ago. Murder of an entire band's appeal. I'm a pretty big Ramones fan, and I'll be the first to admit their later work is totally lame, but the blood of this record is on Spector's probably alreadly bloodied hands. (I mean, chances are, right?) Don't get me wrong, his wall of sound works some places - - pretty much of all of his work with The Righteous Bros. is quality i.e. ""Unchained Melody"", but ""End of the Century"" is totally flat. Even still, the music on it is only OK. If someone somewhere pulled a ""Let It Be...Naked"" on this album I would at most give it 2.5 stars. Anyway, save your money. Personally, I wouldn't even check this out at the library."
2,Blah!,"This album is kind of strange . . . one of the world's fastest punk bands it seems is trying to give way to pop songs without any really hard edge to them. Only a few songs are memorable, some are funny, but really a pretty weak effort. The cover is better than the music!"
1,Note from Ventures management,"Buyer beware! This is a bootleg CD, produced in Japan and containing a compilation of product originally recorded in the 60's and 80's. It purports to have been legitimately licensed, but was not. Don't waste your time and money."
4,very good writing book,this is a very good writing book for children. There is enough space for young children to learn how to right.
4,Big help...,"It's not the newest version of this book since at the time I got it Amazon wasn't carrying it, but it was still very helpful and concise."
5,Freeweeling 75 year old gal,"Get up every morning and unhitch my bike, and hit the road. I got a flag for the back, and a loud horn, and I have never had so much attention, especially those old coots as I pass the old folks home on my daily ride."
2,Trike review,"I received this trike in a very large carton that had some damage. Fortunately everything inside was OK. It took me about 3 hours to assemble it. It is well built and a pleasure to ride. The steering takes a little to get use to but everything works fine. My 12 lb Schnauzer enjoys riding in the basket. I would rate it a 9 out of 10.Doug - Crystal River, Florida"
1,Disappointed,"Took over 2 hours and 3 phone calls to the 800 number to get bicycle put together. Never did get the seat to stay in position, it kept falling forward. Got ready to get on bike to try it out only to discover that the bike will not move backward -- no matter how hard you pushed it, it wouldn't move back. Who ever heard of a bike that only moved forward. Took it back, got refund. Waste of time, money and big disappointment. The final 800 call confirmed that no, the bike does not roll backward. If you want it to, you need to pick up the rear drive wheel (70 pounds)."
2,Very Bad Experience,"Bought the trike for Christmas, 2010. End of Feb 2011 right bearing desintigrates. Schwinn mails me new bearing within one week. Trouble is labor to replace bearing was $150 Took 4.5 hours. Otherwise trike is good. If you decide to buy this trike, I hope you have better luck.I have contacted Pacific Bikes and they said that if I provide the correct documents they will 'consider' reimbursing me the labor. Stay tuned."
5,adult three wheeled bicycle,"The bicycle is wonderful especially for an adult who can no longer balance on a two wheeled bike or walk for any distance. The seat was not comfortable for an overweight adult, but I ordered a different Schwinn seat and it is very comfortable. Putting this bike together took two adults and a lot of time and patience. It was not an easy assembly and if I had known that, I would have gladly paid to have someone else assemble it for me. It is a wonderful ride."
2,Instructions are HORRIBLE!!,"The instructions are not detailed and the parts do not correctly align. For the extra $50-100, you can get the bike already put together at a local store."
4,Purchased as a gift,"This bike came quickly. It was unassembled in a large box. I gave it to my sister for a gift. Her sons put it together. I don't know if she likes it, but she hasn't complained...that's a good sign."
3,way too difficult to assemble,"It is a great tricycle once assembled... the manual,however is written in a very technical language and I was unable to assemble myself. I had to take all the pieces to a local schwinn bike shop to assemble"
4,Schwinn Meridian Adult 26-Inch 3-Wheel Bike,"The Schwinn Meridian Adult 26-Inch 3-Wheel Bike is great. It is a single speed bike that is well made and easy to pedal. It was easy to assemble. The only reason the bike did not get 5 stars is that the corrugated shipping carton was badly torn by the shipper, however no parts were damaged or missing from the carton. I only wish the carton was stronger. I would buy another one."
2,Mediocre bike,"It's an average bike at best. Forget about the instructions to put it together. you get the standard instructions for a two wheel bike and then a piece of paper for additional parts. If you are not handy with tools, take it to a bike shop and pay for having it put together.the bike arrived with the box partially opened and scratches on the frame."
3,Somewhat Dissapointed!,"I give this product only 3 stars because the assembly was way more difficult than expected, given the information stated it could be done in 45-60 minutes. I suppose if you are a professional bike installer it could be done in that time frame. The fenders also arrived somewhat bent, and a screw for the front fender was missing. Had to call customer service for a replacement. They wanted a ""date code,"" as well as the model number; I was told the ""code"" could be found ""near the pedal area."" I found a small, shiny label on the frame near the pedal area that I could not read, even with a flashlight and magnifying glass. Don't know why they would put this info there instead of on or near the top. Also, the seat, with the ""horn"" on the front in extremely uncomfortable. I plan to replace it. I was also surprised at the amount of maintenance necessary. Don't know how long I will keep this bike. I was looking forward to using it for exercise, and to get around my gated community."
3,"Bike okay, assembly not so good.",The bike is quite good except for a few discrepancies -1. The seat is horrible. It is by far the most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat on. I will be replacing it.2. The screws supplied to attach the rear fenders did not fit.3. The brake assembly had to be modified in order to make it fit and operate.Thank goodness I am mechanically adept and have the tools that I needed to put the bike together and make the necessaryadaptations to the brake mechanism.
2,runs in circles,This trike only has one of the rear wheels hooked up to drive it forward. As a result it tends to want to go in circles and feel very unstable to my wife for whom we purchase.
3,Luke warm,"I am old and Schwinn was a legendary brand; this one came from China. It was a real challenge to assemble. Metric allen wrenches; metric end wrenches; english wrenches for the seat. The seat was not level and needed adjusting. Material and workmanship generaly was good. My advice to a buyer is to order through a store and look at the assembled trike. Sit on the seat; test the handlebars to be sure they are secure. Be sure a ""tricycle"" is what you want."
3,I would love to ride this bike...,"...however, the first one was damaged during shipment. It arrived 28 April in a battered box; one fender was severely scratched and one tire had a hole in it. A replacement was requested and confirmed on 4 May (Amazon customer service was very helpful).The replacement box finally arrived today in a box that looks worse than the first package. I would love to ride the bike and let everyone know how this product performed, but I just can't seem to get one to arrive unscathed. :("
3,Needs better assembly instructions,"The bike is OK, but I had a hard time with the rear drive chain, which at first kept skipping as I peddeled, had to disassemble everything, remove a link, then realized that the rear assy. could be moved to set the chain. Instructions could have prevented this agrivation."
1,Not a product for elderly people,"I purchased this tricycle for my wife who has had recent hip and knee replacements, hoping the tricycle would help to improve mussel function and improve her mobility. The trike. has only one rear drive wheel which causes it to want to constantly pull to the drive wheel side. It is imposible for her to ride it. I will have to sell it I have also tried to ride it, and find it very difficult to control"
2,"Schwinn Meridiian Adult 26"" 3-wheel Bike (Blue)","My first and last purchase from Amazon.com. One of the rims was slightly bent and something is wrong with the axle. It is at my condo in Florida and I haven't been able to try to use it but a few times. Calls to Amazon were basically dealt with a ""too bad, so sad"". When I go back down in a couple of weeks, I will have to take it to a bike repair shop. When I rode it, it made so much noise, people could hear me coming a block away. I received no satisfacory response from Amazon. They should have been prepared to replace it, but that is not going to happen. All I got was a brush off. It is a beautiful bike. I just wish it worked flawlessly. I don't imagine anyone at Amazon reads these reviews, which is too bad."
3,Cool bike! but...,"I received the bike and assembled it. The bike was my wife's Christmas present and she loves the bike. However, the front wheel was so bent when it was delivered, the bike was unridable. I had to go a local bike shop and purchase a new rim for the bike. It's a good looking bike and rides well now. After riding it I found it could use at least 3 speeds."
4,"Nice trike, looks good","Only had one complaint and that was that no assembly instructions were included. Managed to put it all together without instructions, but is always nice to have, just in case something doesn't appear obvious to those of us who are mechanically challenged."
2,Beware of problems with Schwinn Meridian 26 three wheel bike,"I bought the Schwinn Meridian 26 inch adult bike for my special needs daughter for Christmas. It has only been a month since I received it and there are problems with a cluncking noise coming from one of the wheels or from somewhere not yet found. The exact problem is yet to be discovered. The fenders do not fit properly and don't seem very durable. They rub the tires because they don't fit properly (they don't cover the tires). Had to adjust the rear chain already. Of course, it is past the date to return it so I will just have to keep trying to find out where the clunking is coming from. Meanwhile, my special needs daughter is not very happy either. I thought Schwinn was a good bicycle but apparently that is no longer the case. The tires are wearing already so they are apparently not of good quality either. It is a nice looking bike but I would never buy another one."
1,Unsatisfied - Customer service is horrible,"I bought this product and the first time out one of the sprocket assemblies came apart. Called Customer service they sent me the wrong part. Called again, got disconnected. Called again and they sent me the wrong part once again. I want my money back for this cheaply made product."
1,Many missing parts,"This package came in a very timely manner and packed well. However, it was missing the seat, the seat post, the parts box, chain, reflector kit and pedal set! Returned for a refund."
3,good bike but made a little cheap,"Overall the design is fine. My son loves it. The only negatives are the instructions and some of the parts. The instructions are worthless, just throw them away. I broke two bolts trying to tighten them, they were made of some really cheap metal, almost plastic. We do like the bike though."
2,Very disappointed,"Received 2 boxes of pedals and no box with the second chain that is needed. There were scratches and a large dent on the frame. The left back fender had paint chipped all along one edge. The right back fender was badly dented, paint scratched and chipped. One end is twisted such that using it will cause it to rub on the tire. It will need to be replaced. There was no parts list, so we don't know if there is anything else missing. The pieces were wrapped in paper and cardboard so damage happened at plant. Customer service is only available Mon - Fri (8-5). Can't tell if I'll like it til I get the parts needed to put it together."
5,SCHWINNTACKULAR,"LOVE IT,LOVE IT,LOVE IT.NOT ONLY IS IT BEAUTIFUL BUT COMFORTABLE. IM GETTING ALL THE EXERCISE AND FUN I HAVE MISSED FOR THE LAST 30 YRS.GREAT PRICE AND SERVICE. THANKS AMMASON. CATHY WAINIKAINEN"
1,parts are missing.,The following Parts are missing from the package.two pedalsmaster chain2 master linkstwo wheel capsOne corner of the box was damaged.
4,adult trike,all was fine except the smaller fo two chain was broken. I have not used it yet until I can get the chain repaired. Will seller send me the chain?the box had a big gaping hole at the corner so I called Amazon to make sure I mcould open the box and if anything was wrong or missing I could get them corrected.
3,trick it,"The bike is wonderful and it will give me the stability to once more ride again. It did come with some damage. Both back fenders were dented and one was scratched. I plan to trick it out with a bell, flag, and other adornments. I also ordered a cover but it has not arrived and no orders are outstanding."
5,Assembly Manual,"Many of the reviews of this adult trike expressed a complaint that the assembly instructions that came in the box were general for two-wheeled bicycles. Some mentioned a one-page insert for the trike. I surfed the net and found a 35 page PDF manual with text, diagrams, and warnings about potential problems. Anyone wishing to get that manual can find it at: [...]"
5,A Winner,"It was a little tricky learning the steering difference (BIG!) between two-wheelers and three-wheelers, but once that was mastered,it has been a superb,dependable,tough bike."
5,Great bike!,"I bought this bike 3 years ago for my autistic son to ride and he absolutely loves it. Easy ride, great for anyone."
3,3 wheeled bike from Schwin,"When I received the product the box was a mess. Upon opening it one of the rear wheels were bent, screws were missing and the stem for the handle bars was scratched. My husband called Schwin and they sent out everything we needed but it took several days. As far as the bike once we had it fixed so I could ride it I really like it."
1,Terrible workmanship,I was very disappointed with this purchase. Right back tire is crooked.Fenders do not fit correctly.Sure hope when I take it out on the road it's rides OK. My husband and I couldn't believe how cheaply made it is.For almost 300.00 dollars it' not worth it.
4,Needed a replacement..,The first bike shipped was obviously a returned item that nobody bothered to check - had damage and missing parts. But Amazon return (my first) was easy to use and replacement came faster than the original shipment.
5,I am very pleased with this 3-wheel bike,"I had been considering purchasing a 3-wheel bike for a while, but, did not know if I could pedal it since I have severe leg and knee pain. I ride my bike daily when the weather is good. I was amazed at how easy it is to pedal and I like the way I can pedal backwards to align the pedals up so my legs can begin to push. I use the rear basket to put things in, such as cans of dog food when I go out to feed my dogs. I can also carry eggs in the basket that I collect from the chickens. Even with the severe leg and knee pain I find it easier to pedal around instead of walking. This bike has opened up a whole knew expierence for me. If I get tired and want to rest I can just stop. With the 3 wheels I don't have to hold myself up. I recommend this bike to anyone who wants to get exercise and suffer from knee and leg pain."
3,Decent..,"When we opened the box for the bike, we noticed that some of the parts were scratched - deeply. On top of that, we were missing two nuts. Luckily we were able to find some that fit, but we were not overly impressed with the condition. Also, it would have been more helpful if the directions had a list of parts, that way we could have accounted for them before we found out there were missing."
2,Not Stable and Heavy,"I recently purchased this bike for my 70 plus year old mother that had knee surgery not long ago. The assembly was fairly simple with the help of a friend, although you need to be very careful tightening the bolts for the front fender since the head of the bolt cracked off after very little torque from the socket wrench.What I was most disappointed about is that the bike is very unstable. I have never owned a adult 3 wheel bicycle, but this was definatly not made to drive on anything but flat surfaces with little grade. My mother almost drove hers into the ditch after several attempts riding it on a slight grade. The seat springs are very weak making the stability issue more prevailant. Also, for an aluminum framed bike it is quite heavy due to the rear axel being quite heavy.I really wanted to like this bike. In the end it is sitting in her shed soon to be added to craigslist."
5,So happy abouy my Schwinn Meridian Adult 26-Inch 3-Wheel Bike,"I am so happy that I purchased the Schwinn Meridian Adult 26-Inch 3-Wheel Bike. I am a 59 year old female that does no exercise. So, i decided to purchase a bicycle. I first purchased a regular two wheel bicycle and found out that I could not balance the bike so I returned it and was really sad. I made up my mind that I really needed some exercise, so my husband suggested that I go on-line to see if I could find a three wheeler. I did and boy was I happy. After I received the bicycle I have not stop riding. The steering is a little different, but after riding for a while, you get use to it. I am really getting the exercise that I need and once I am done, I sleep like a baby,Hooray for Schwinn Meridian 3-Wheeler Bike..."
1,Target Doesn't Ship!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, I first ordered a Balck Cherry. Listed as ""IN STOCK""... 5 Days later, after looking like it's been shipped, it hasn't been and then I am offered a chance to CANCEL.So, I Cancelled. And, am now trying the Blue Color Bike.Two Things...1. **IF** this goes the same way I will delete my Amazom account!2. The inability to contact Amazon and inquire as to whether I could change color or if the Blue bike was in stock Is Maddening!If this is a Target/ITC problem Amazon should drop them!!!!!!!!!!!Yes, I am extremely angry! This is for my wife...Amazon needs a Discuss This Order Option... It's either IN STOCK (and ready for Shipment) or it isn't!!!!!!!!!!!Mike Sr."
4,Schwinn Meridian Adult 26-Inch 3-Wheel Bike (Black Cherry),"bike will take you approximately 40 minutes to assembly and you will need another person to help you. not hard, just alot of bolts and holding things steady.the bike rides well, but you need to slow down quite a bit to make turns.the handle bars are rather long and if you have a large tummy, it will get in the way when you turn.I like the color and the convenient basket. my two small kids likes getting into the basket and going for a short ride within my driveway."
5,3 wheeled bike,Quality bike as always with schwinn. I came near completely assembled - not much left to install.Very easy pedal for being a single speed bike.
5,Great Adult Bike,I bought this Schwinn Meridian Adult Bike because a year and half ago I fell while riding a two wheel bike when I turned to go up on a driveway. I suffered a serious injury to my left thigh and swore off biking. Then I saw this on Amazon. I feel safe on it and I love it. It is great exercise for me to work my upper leg muscles in conjunction with the exercise I do on the Tread Mill. This is a really good buy.
4,"Great Deal, and super fast shipping ?","This Bike is very nice and big. Standard shipping to me was by Fed-ex 3day, and received the bike in 3 days after ordering. Was quite surprised since it is such a big box. But since it was shipped so fast not much detail was paid to the handling of the item. Box came pretty torn up,1 bent fender and 1 nut missing, but was able to find quickly at the Ace hardware. Did not come with instructions on how to put it together, so everything was done twice. Instructions were for a 2 wheeled bike, which is substantially different. Once it was put together, it rides great."
5,Schwinn Adult 3 wheeled bike,"I purchased the schwinn adult 3-wheeled bike as a gift for a disabled friend whom is in a wheelchair for exercise. He thought he would need someone to hire to put the bike together! WRONG!! He said it was really simple to follow the instructions and put it together!!! And less than an hour later he was on it riding around town! ""We can't keep him off of it since ! ""The 3 wheeler bikes at bike stores in our community cost from $450.00 and up , and are not half as nice as the ""Schwinn 3-wheeled Adult-Trike""!! ""A GREAT BARGIN< FOR THE MONEY""!!!!!"
3,Schwinn 3 wheel bike is adequate.,I was disapointed that when we got the bike one of the parts was defective. We had to wait a week to get the new part which then meant we had to disassemble the hand brakes and reattached them. Upon trying to complete the installation we were missing a few bolts and nuts and had to purchase them at the hardware store so we didnt delay the installation. This was a gift for my daughter who has balance and coodination issues and cant ride a 2 wheeled bike. The fenders are very flimsy and so are the brakes. The frame is very solid. It will do for her who will ride the bike occasionally for recreation. I would not recommend it for someone who is going to be doing alot of riding. The price was right for what we wanted it for but would have liked to been able to have it come with all parts and have the fenders and brakes better quality.
2,Why do you need three wheeler?,"I purchased this because I did not know how to ride a bicycle, but now find it a mistake. The shipping from Arizona to Washington State might have left a big environmental footprint. Please try it out before buying it if you can. If you live in a city, where there are narrow bike lanes with many cyclists, think twice. In addition, if you live in a place with some grades, it is hard to get over the hills. Furthermore, it is asymmetrical powerwise, it steers to right. Basket is heavy, but you may decide not install it or replace it with a lighter one. The assembly instructions were poor. If you need it for exercise or mobility, it is not a good choice. It is heavy, it takes storage space, and it requires a lot of power. If you need a bike, get a bicycle, or if you want to learn to bike, use adult training wheels on a bicycle. If I knew what I know now, I would not have purchased it."
3,Schwinn Trike 2010,"I purchase my Schwinn Meridian in March of 2010. I love my Trike, I would give it 5 Stars, however I'm experiencing a noise in the rear of the Trike, I have oiled and tighten the outer bolts of the drive shaft but it continues to make a loud clicking sound when I'm ride the Trike. Also on two occasions my granddaughter has gotten her shoe string caught on the chain guard finder. The chain guard finder is not very sturdy, in fact very flimsy! But I do love my Trike."
5,3 wheel schwinn meridian bike,"The bike was exactly as pictured on the web page, was easely assembled, and delivered promptly. I am very satisfied, and find the bike just as it was described on the web page. I would recomend this bike to anyone who is interested in a three wheeler. Bill H. Hill"
3,A adult 3 wheel bike for Nancy,"A wonderful bike, delivered speedy, at a great price - took four hours to assembly - very well built - still one problem, however, there is a click every 360 degrees at the rear - in touch with Schwinn in trying to solve this minor problem and they have been responsive so far."
5,Perfect Ride,"Item arrived in timely manner and performs as promised. Still having some problems getting the rear fenders not to rub the tires but other than that, I could not be happier."
4,I like it,I wish I had purchased a bike with more gears so I would be able to make it up more of the hills around my home.The fenders are cheaply made but I like the collapsible basket.
1,Dents in the Fenders,"Well unfortunately just like some of the other reviews mentioned my bike came with several dents in both rear fenders. I am really disappointed because I order from Amazon on a regular basis and have always been happy with my purchases. I am returning it, thankfully the return shipping is free, and I'll purchase it for the same price somewhere else where I know it will not come damaged."
3,schwinn 3 wheel bike,"missing 3 bolts....but after i find all the parts that i didn't get, i will be able to complete putting it together....I'm sure I will enjoy after the inconvenience.."
4,"Crisp, refreshing period instrument Beethoven","Christopher Hogwood and Roger Norrington conducted roughly parallel recorded Beethoven symphony cycles with their respective period instrument orchestras (which actually had many of the same players between them), in the commercial recording heyday for those ensembles in the 1980s. Hogwood's began truly at the beginning, with Beethoven 1 and 2. 20+ years on, these performances remain very crisp and refreshing, even if the HIP ideas of smaller orchestras and faster tempi have generally caught on more in contemporary Beethoven orchestral performances. Factoring in the relatively brisk tempi, the performances are quite ""straight"" and unmannered, leaving the past era of Furtwangler-like free phrasing well behind. This recording is still worth hearing now."
1,This litter literally stinks!,"This has to be the worst litter ever. Not only does it reek, it clumps horribly and it's a pain to flush. So far the best luck I've had with litter has been with crystal based litters. No smell. Which is more important to me than the clumping."
4,as advertised,"I don't have a problem with re-ordering again. It was exactly as advertised. The price was reasonable. I felt that the product could have been packaged better, instead of just placing the bottle in a manila envelope. Maybe some air bubble padding to prevent any damaging to the bottle. The delivery time was about average."
1,Ingredients not understandable,"The ingredients are written in a language that I cannot read, therefore I cannot not rate it. If there is an English version, please advise."
4,Good Quality....BUT....,"Based on the information on the product, this seems to be a very good fish oil supplement. I recently switched over from regular use of the Nature Made brand...and simply wanted to give a new brand a try. I must say....the pills are easy to swallow for me. Softgels. BUT...while I never got the fishy burps with NM, I DO get them with this brand! Could it be the....potency? I dunno. That really isnt a deterrent for me. And the price WAS great! Happy with my purchase!"
3,heartburn?,"There's frequent mention of fishy burps- which I don't get. I do, however, notice that I get heartburn after taking these on an empty stomach. I would have to do some better controlled experiments to be sure, but for now I think I'll go back to the Costco brand."
3,"Not As I Remembered, But In Some Ways Better",Timely shipping and good video quality. The show definitely brought back memories.
4,US luggage briefcase,This product works very well for me and is quite durable. I have found it handles my daily caseload well including laptop and accessories. The only drawback I see is the overall bulk which I guess goes with the concept of carrying your office in a bag. Thanks.
4,Pretty good except for...,"Like the rest of the Walking with series, it is very interesting and filmed as if the documentary is being filmed in the present time. What I did not like was that many things were not explained. Like how do they know, or why do they think these people are the first to have white sclera? The bonus features do not explain these things either and are not very interesting. The overall program is very interesting though."
2,The Neanderthal of this Excellent Series,"We got this while still buzzed from Walking With the Dinosaurs. The buzz ended quickly. The actors playing the cave people look just like that--modern day actors playing cave people. I can just see the director saying,""Blake, you're hungry! You're tired! You just killed the mammoth and must carry meat back to your mate! Makeup--he needs more grime!"". It's bearable the first time you watch it, but then you spend the next time through hoping that some big predator will leap into the scene and crunch them all so you don't have to watch it again. Our resident dinosaur expert watched it once, took it back to the library and never wanted to get it again (thank you, thank you!). Having now watched Walking With the Dinosaurs at least sixty times, I can definitely tell you to save your pennies & get a different DVD."
4,Robert Winston is NOT in this release,"In case anyone thought from the review below that this is the same as the UK version they should know that it does NOT have a presenter. Instead the wonderfully imagined scenes of what our ancestors were like are presented more in the style of Walking with Dinosaurs, as if you are there, with a voiced narration explaining what you are seeing."
3,Alec Baldwin Explains It All,"When watching ""Walking With Cavemen"" which is a very-well produced educational film - I could not help but laugh every time Alec Baldwin appeared on camera. There's just something so goofy about him - that you half expect, at any moment, he will drop a 2 million year old skull smashing it into 10,000 pieces.And that hair of his! Can you imagine how much more entertaining this film would be if each succeeding proto-human species donned a hair style that was slowly, inexorably, evolving to look like Alec Baldwin's?""And here's Cro-Magnon Man, whose demise would have come eons earlier had it not been for the fantastic hair styling technique they developed 200,000 years ago. A hair style that is still widely in use today..."", as Mr. Baldwin winks at the camera.The ""Walking with..."" series is ripe for parody - if it's not already a parody of itself."
1,The Worse Prehistory Documentry,"This is by far the worsed Walking with... documentry yet. Getting humans in monkey suits running around just makes it plane useless! If you are really interested in hominids, you can buy this, otherwise just keep with Walking with Beasts and Walking with Dinosaurs!!"
1,Wow! It's the end of the world,"In the end, right will be seen as wrong and wrong will be celebrated as right. This show proves that. Sickening."
4,Has held up reasonably well for almost 3 years,"We got this set for my son's 3rd birthday after looking at every space themed bedding set we could find. This was our favorite set and it is just as appropriate for our child at [almost] 6 as it was at 3. I love the design and the colors and I am reasonably satisfied with how this has held up as his full-time bedding. Obviously, it's been washed a ton and while the blues have naturally faded some (especially in the matching comforter), the stitching in all but the embroidery surrounding the sun in this sham have stayed together. Overall, I would recommend it."
4,Fun for starters,Nice for shooting cups in your spare time. Don't bother using the laser scope or even putting it on. It doesnt work. The gun isnt accurate but can get within an accepted range of the target depending on your distance. I suggest you use the aim thing above at the end of the gun. The singer/semi/auto is just for looks.
2,I really was not good,I bought this gun after many others and i let sombody use it they cliped it in somethin and the whole front came off and the clip breacks easy i would look away if i were you [*-*]
4,SPOOKY MINI DOCUMENTARIES -- SILLY AND SCARY,"Hosted by Patrick McNee, TALES OF THE UNEXPLAINED is almost three and a half hours of documentary-like segments on UFOs, Creatures of the Night, the London Underworld and The Mysteries of Life.If you're a sucker for this kind of slightly tongue in cheek material but told with a styraight face -- and I am -- you'll relish the opportunity to yet again rethink the alleged Roswell UFO crash, or take a peek at the ghost of Montgomery Clift in an old Hollywood home. Learn more about the strange disappearance of Jack the Ripper. Visit the English home of author Bram Stoker and then the actual sites of the real Dracula. Ooooh. And much more.However, in light of todays headlines, the segment that truly lingers is a look at ""Divine Magnetism"" and the power of suggestion that cults and religious extremists have over their followers, getting them to perform deadly acts they might otherwise never consider."
3,Would have rather rented it,"The stories are really just ""okay"". A little boring. Would have rather just rented than added to my collection. Probably not something I would watch again."
5,good price on omega 3 fish oil capsules,"These are the least expensive Omega 3 Fish Oil capsules I have found so far. No ""fish burps"" after taking them. The only thing I don't like is the way the capsules tend to get sticky while in my pill organizer, but given the humidity and near constant rain here that's not an unusual problem for me."
3,A Little disappointing,"I thought that I would have received only Omega 3, but, I note that this product is Omega 3, 6 and 9.I'm very wary about Omega 6 so I do not think that I'll be using it. I'm pleased that I ordered Omega 3 in the 300 softgels as this will see me for some time.Thank youBarbara"
2,Not 42 minutes!!,"I can't believe that I put this in and sat down to watch a 42 minute DVD and it ended up being around 15 minutes. I don't know why it says the run time is 42 minutes. The 15 minutes is interesting, but not worth $20. What a dissapointment!!"
1,"Good idea, poorly executed...","I can only concur with the previous reviewer. A cultural history of reggae album covers would be a wonderful idea, but this one is not it unfortunately. The text is patronising and only serves to further exoticise Jamaican artists, the choice of sleeves displays a fondness for lions but very little knowledge of the subject. Nothing on Studio One silk screen covers, no mention of Orville 'Bagga' Case, no discussion of the 'Zippo' lighter sleeve to Catch A Fire... I could go on and on, as Buju Banton would say."
2,Reggae Marketing Ting,"This slim package tries to makes reggae biz'ness seem more important than the deep spirit behind the music. Empty reasonings, dumb view."
1,Pseudo Books Discover Reggae Market,"Purveyors of slapped-together pseudobooks have discovered the reggae market. So now we're getting products like this one, which feature a minor amount of disposable text and reproductions of assorted reggae records. Some are worth a short glance, most are not. Just as happened with heavy metal and teen pop, there are those who think reggae fans will buy anything with the word 'reggae' stuck on it. But this thing signals a new low has been found. Bah, Babylon!"
1,We Need A Better Book,"Let us be true. Most reggae album covers specialize in exploiting and demeaning the women of the Caribbean, with their wine and grind, ca'an dun, punanny, baggy and boops attitudes. That's how it really goes when it comes time to push all the tunes! There is a true book to be written about how reggae's sisters and lionesses have been mistreated, and this silly and insulting object is not it."
5,this is a great book,I am enchanted with this beautiful book of reggae album covers. Mr. Morrow's highly perceptive insight into reggae's truth and simplicity is gem that I haven't seen elsewhere.
5,Stir it Up: A thought provoking book,"I live in a town that is devoid of diversified cultures. The art museum mainly displayes classical and modern paintings and the music scene is comprised of little more than college bar bands. Therefore I am rarely exposed to different cultures. While searching Amazon's website, I discovered ""Stir it Up"" and was intrigued by the premise of the book. I decided to purchase ""Stir it Up"" and was amazed by how Morrow described a whole new sub-genre that was completely foriegn to me. Furthermore, I enjoyed how Morrow provided the reader with the proper tools to make intelligent and insightful interpretations to the symbolic and hidden meanings of the album covers. Thankfuly, due to ""Stir it Up,"" it was a whole new course in art appreciation."
1,Solti at his worst,"This performance is plain awful-especially now that there are so many fine, indeed extraordinary versions of this symphony on disc. This symphony seems to be the antithesis of Solti the muscian, a shame, considering how much I love the both SOlti and this symphony. Back when there were only a few choices, this was passable-except for Bernsteins 63 account which still ranks as one of the best. But now with Chailly, Rattle, and Gielen to name the very best(along with Berns first one) there is no need to waste your time with this one(or Solti's Mahler in general with few exceptions being the first and eighth(otherwise satisfy your addiciton elsewhere.)"
1,As Distorted In Its Way,"It sounded like an open-minded inquiry, but Chomsky advanced an agenda of his own. Disappointing."
1,Noam is an hypocrite,Noam hates the western world all the while living in america and enjoying the conforts of western civilization. Maybe he should live in a communist country to get some perspective on what his ideas amount to.Some people have told that I dont really know what I am talking about here. I can only recommend them to read what Noam wrote about Cuba. Hope to see you there Noam.
5,Very interesting DVD,"Professor Chomsky's new DVD release is a great experience for anyone who wants to gain knowledge about the war on terrorism. It gives very interesting analysis what is happening behind the news headlines. This DVD portrays the reasons why many foreigners dislike our politics and actions. The opening sequence is nicely done. The picture is clean. The audio mix is good. It has nice menus, and chapter search. My edition has English, and Chinese subtitles. Buy this DVD and learn, learn, learn!"
5,A must have! I'm buying a few to give to my friends!,"Prof. Chomsky offers a very interesting view about the""war on terrorism"" and other related subjects. Theentire DVD is excellent but the Q&A; is priceless.The one(s) who say that Prof. Chomsky is a masterof lies or a danger to the country (maybe he is a terrorist!)has either not seen the DVD, or worse, has not checkedthe data he has given.Get it! It's worth every single penny of your (only) [$$$]!The worst blind is the one that doesn't want to see."
4,Chomsky's perspective is always valuable,"Lots of useful information here. It's not going to make you happy if you can't accept that the USA is an imperialist country. If you can, you'll like this. It's presented in a no-frills way, which is good --- it's a lecture on DVD, not a fun movie."
1,boring lecture,"This is a video of Professor Chomsky at a podium, lecturing. There are no visual aids, and it is not a polished speech- just the casual (he leans on the podium) and disorganized talk. Very interesting material in a very boring delivery- too bad. A waste of DVD money- this would be better as a short essay."
2,Noam Chomsky - Distorted Morality: America's War on Terror?,Could fall asleep easily. Reminds me of poly. sci. 101The Q & A session in the end is good.
3,"Sorry, but Noam is a fluffer","The man never says anything significant. Believe me, I WISH he were legit. He is too poo-poo-ish in nature and he NEVER names names (REAL NAMES that you don't already know). And gimme a bank statement or two. I wish Howard Zinn were a better public speaker."
4,Chumpsky,"Noam Chomsky likes critisizing the USA because he lives here and feels like his efforts should be concentrated on the place he knows (hates) best. He doesn't critisize other countries because WE DONT KNOW if they would have been driven to the kinds of extreme reactionary measures they are today if not under American oppression. WIth that frame of mind Chomsky is free to tear American policy apart without even having to equivocate. He might want to check out history before America so see how violent and disgusting human behavior can get. And if he started critisizing other countries he might have to 'think outside the box' so to speak, and realize this country that provides him an expensive soap box at MIT isn't so bad."
1,BRILLIANT !!!!!!!,"once again, chomsky shows he is one of the most brilliant men alive! It's all America's fault! - the evils of capitalism! long live socialism! yet the man is able to publish the same book every six months and charge $14.95 for it BRILLIANT!from marxist to capitalist in one easy printing!"
4,Very good dictionary,I am very happy with this dictionary. It is helping me with the technical translations I got to do every day.
1,Do Not Buy This - Plug & Cord Melted after 3 Uses,"It seemed to work okay, but not as well as I had hoped.When shopping, I did read that the Kitchen Aid was probably better.I now have a melted cord and plug, after grinding apricots and nuts.When I called Cuisinart, they said I should have chopped the apricots, into small pieces before using this machine.I asked Cuisinart to pay the shipping to replace it. They said, they would pay half the shipping, but I would have to pay to send it to them.Arlene, the lead tech, said it worked, since it ""worked for one day""I spoke to Veronica and Arlene at Cuisinart on January 26, 2005.Now I hope Amazon takes this back, and I can get the Kitchen Aid instead"
3,bulky,THIS PRODUCT IS TOO LONG FOR ITS INTENDED USE. IT DOESN'T FIT WELL IN A SMALL SHOP BUT IF YOU HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM...BUY IT
5,Learn Spanish Like a Child,"I loved Richard Scarry picture books when I was a child. They were so interesting and lively, showing different aspects of life with the words next to the actions or objects. When a co-worker of mine changed careers to go from market research to teaching Spanish, I bought this book for her to use in the classroom. Then I bought one for my husband, who is a grade school principal where they teach Spanish as a second language. I still delight in looking at the pages and following the characters through town and farm life. It's a natural way to learn the first words of a Spanish vocabulary in a memorable way."
4,Killer playing!,What a great band. I wasn't as crazy about the tunes on this CD as I have been on his more recent projects. But his virtuosity is amazing! My personal favorite of his isSoul Insider
1,Absolutely terrible......,"Never, in my life have I seen a movie that was this bad. NO wonder that Shore and Baldwin's careers have evaporated. Imagine ten year old kids who have access to a camcorder and you still could not fathom how bad this movie is. Inept, juvenile, stupid, and not even remotely funny. Well I take that back, there were two humorous things: Pauly Shore's receeding hairline and Baldwin's inability to act."
1,STUPID,"Completely dumb, it's like if they took the four jokes that were too bad for ""Dumb and Dumber"" and they put it in this stupid film. The acting is bad, the dialogs are not funny, THE MOVIE IS DUMB. But maybe I didn't get the point, maybe it's a brilliant psychological drama. If it is, please correct me..."
1,BioDome,The movie was purchased for my daughter as a Christmas gift and it is defective. It will not play in any devise we try it in.
1,The 2nd Most Unintentional Homo-Erotic Movie Ever,"Next top Top Gun, this has to be the most un-intentionally homo-erotic movie ever made. If you watch the interaction between Baldwin's and Shore's characters you see lot of things taking place that two straight men would never do. A lot of the jokes play on homsexual subtexts. I watched this move twice with two groups of guys and said nothing and everyone in each group said the same thing afterwards. Not that they thought the movie itself was gay (it was just bad), but that the actions of the two male leads were very homosexual in nature and would be very reminiscent of what a gay couple might do."
1,This is unwatchable.,This movie makes me want to vomit. Watching Bio-Dome is physically painful to the overwhelming majority of people.
3,pauly shore,"Well...i have to say that the only reason i watched this movie was because it was late at night and it was the only thing on. I started watching it cause everything i read gave it 1 star or the worst possible rating. Well, when i realized that Pauly Shore was in it, i was like ""Well of course it 1 star if he's in it."" I was looking foreward to seeing how bad it was. But i was wrong. This movie actually made me laugh. I kinda hated all Pauly Shore's other movies. Jury Duty sucked and Son-in Law was horrible. But Bio-Dome was different. Dont get me wrong, this movie wasnt good, but it wasnt bad either. It had some really stupid stuff in it that annoyed the hell out of me though. It's definately Shore's best."
3,Okay! A Lot Better Than Jury Duty!,"There was some stuff in Bio-Dome that was funny, the flatulance joke, the whole routine of Pauley Shore's and Stephen Baldwin's characters getting flatulance and trying to guess what each other ate by the smell of their flatulance was funny but gets kind of old after a while, Now don't get me wrong, I'm no mamby pamby prude who gets easily offended and I'm not against flatulance jokes in movies, anyway I remember seeing a movie I think it was called California Knights that had a very funny flatulant scene that I personally found funnier than the one in Bio-Dome but different strokes for different folks I guess, and I do have another thing to say about this movie at least it's much better than Jury Duty which wasn't funny at all!"
4,CUSTOMER SERVICE,GOT THE ITEM EARLIER THEN EXPECTED. I GET THIS FOR MY NEPHEW. HE HASN'T COMPLAINED YET!
1,It was awful,"This has to be one of the most awful films I ever tried to watch. We are supposed to believe that Shore and Baldwin are two lovable scamps, but they come across as two obnoxious idiots who aren't the least bit funny. I can't believe that Baldwin, who has talent, would appear in a Pauly Shore film, who couldn't prove he had a glimmer of talent to save his life. I tried to watch this film when it premiered on cable but I gave up halfway through. Avoid at all costs."
5,This Is A Bio-Dome Of Laughter!!!,"I love this movie. I can't go an entire day without watching it. One time i was in the audience of leno. Whenever the camera panned over us, i waved a copy of this pleasure in front of it while yelling about how funny this riot is. Ahh, funny i remember the part where that one guy has to itch his balls. Just thinking about it makes me tingle with anticipation!!! Rent this movie or you will not see it. Buy it or forever hold your peace."
4,A Shore thing,"Remember when the Bio-Dome was not a joke? You have to be sophisticated to understand such subtle humor. Many people express themselves in a subliminal manor. If you do not watch closely (like going to the refrig while this film is running) you may not have the opportunity to hear key statements:""What? Do you think you are, some rocket scientist?""""Yes""""Sorry""If this film is not prominently displayed in your library, people will suspect that you have couth.Encino Man"
4,bio dome review,"The movie, Bio Dome, is a must see. Pauly Shore and Steven Baldwin are the main actors. They play as two frat boys who get trapped in a biological bubble with 5 scientists. It is rated pg13. The movie was released in 1996."
1,2 Wrongs make a super wrong...,"Take 2 bad things and put them togerther to make something incredibly bad, namely Pauli Shore and Stephen Baldwin. This is the most moronic unfunny movie I've had inflicted on me in years.The writing is poor, the acting terrible and it goes on forever."
5,viva los Bio Dome,"I love Bio Dome. It's a classic two pals movie like Bill and Ted, Jesse and Chester, and Harold and Kumar."
1,WRONG FREAKING COUNTRY,I read the description but I didn't see anything that said this dvd wasn't American. So I ordered it and it's definitely from Germany and doesn't work in my dvd player.
5,Funny as Hell,"The perfect comedy. I love this movie with all my heart. its the perfect comedy duo, with a great story line and great ending."
4,I had to watch this one twice to make up my mind....,"My favorite term from this movie: Purple Sticky Punch! I liked Baldwin-Boy in this one, although he's not one of my favorite actors. Pauly was his usual screwy self, but I've said it once and I'll say it again: Nothing matches his performance in Encino Man. Am I right? By the way...is it just me, or does the nickname Squirrely ring a distant bell to...Weasel? Think about it...bud-dy..."
1,Makes Adam Sandler movies seem captivating!,"The leading players of this movie say it all: Stupid! We have Pauley ""the Weasel"" Shore doing his thi-ing. Then we have the black-sheep of the Baldwin clan; Billy. Together they land themselves in a major scientific experiment. The story is well dumb, but could have better if actual funny people could have played their roles. Shore and Baldwin just try too hard at being something they are not:funny! I swear one can become dumber after watching this movie. It ranks up there with Carrrot-Top's finest! Don't waste your time or energy."
5,ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES EVER!,"I must admit that at first I really didn't want to watch it, but I talked myself into it. It is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. The only thing that kept me from laughing my butt off was that it was 1 o'clock in the morning. I highly reccomend this movie to people who are into not really having to think while watching a movie, and eveyone else should watch it anyway just in case(as it is an awesome movie and will bring you to tears). Pauly Shore is #1"
1,"BIO-DOME, PAULY SHORE SHOULD GO BACK TO MTV","Bio-dome is sick, disgusting and ridiclous, this movie is like watching a ricky martin video without any interuptions and stephen baldwin One of the baldwin brother should go back to threesome. this is a disaster, a Truly Wasteful disaster."
4,yay for pleasant engaging fun!,"I have to recommend this movie because not only is it silly and fun and escapist, it also has a HUGE rewatchable factor to it. You can watch this movie many times and it never gets boring. The plot is simple (you probably know about it), but it's just the interaction between all the characters that amuse you. Pauly Shore really is very funny in this, but it's also hard to imagine anyone but Stephen Baldwin playing the goofy sidekick. Nothing in this movie is too demanding, and it doesn't matter where in the movie you start watching - it's just breeezy and fun."
1,STUPIDLY OFFENSIVE JUNK,"I have no problem with dumb movies: Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite. Ren, Stimpy, Beavis, and Butthead are among my favorite characters. I even enjoyed other Pauly Shore's movies like In the Army Now, Encino Man, and Son-in-Law. But this one inexcuseably irritating. The two central characters are painfully annoying. There's a big difference between stupid movies made by genius and the one made by moron. This one is unbearable."
3,It's Much better than Jury Duty!,"There were some stuff in Bio-Dome that I thought was very funny and the scene with the whole routine of Pauley Shore's and Stephen Baldwin's characters having flatulance and trying to guess what each other ate by the smell was mostly funny but got a little old after awhile, now don't get me wrong, I'm no prude and it takes a lot too offend me and I'm not against flatulant jokes in movies as I remember watching a movie I think it was called California Knights that has a very funny flatulant scene and I personally found it funnier, but different strokes for different folks I guess! By the way I do think Bio-Dome is like a thousand times better than Jury Duty which I didn't think was funny at all!"
3,"Not bad...........But, not good","This movie had it's moments. That is to say one moment you had a pretty funny joke, the next two guys smelling each others farts. If your into slapstick comedies with no real plot and some lousy characters, see Bio Dome."
1,"Now, don't get me wrong...","...I love a Pauly Shore movie. Cheesy, idiotic, and hopefully with more than a couple laughs and memorable lines. But most of this was just plain tedious. So much so that I got up and took a shower, and when I came back I felt like I had missed absolutely nothing. Well, I missed the end of the movie, but same difference, really. We all knew we were in for a treat when we saw the box had not one critic's praise quoted on it. And Ryan, what kind of mall is this?"
1,"One of, if not the worst movie I've ever seen!!","My son and I took his three children (ages 15,11, and 5 to the movies. The two older children picked Bio Dome. Thank God 5 year old grandson was with us. He got bored and I used him as an excuse to leave the movie and amuse him in the lobby. Five or ten minutes went by and I was approched by the theater manager. ""You must be watching Bio Dome"", he said. I responded with ""yes I'm afraid so"". He said, ""I've been manager since they opened this theater up, and I believe this movie holds the record for walk-outs"". It was BAD!"
5,I now believe in Heaven!,"""~Chuckles heaven that is. THis film is a non stop treat, thanks in part by the comic( and when I use the word comic I use it in the sense that its not comical at all but rather startling un comical, as though shore has tapped into some sort of pseudo-sub particle form of being , in wich humor and rationality don't exist.)I am not being equivalent of an abstract painting. In other words he is so distortingly bad that one may either be inclined to look away or stare right into the center of it,in the vain attempt to peice together some sort of conclusion or at least to try to come to terms with the mess at hand. I really do mean that this film is worth seeing, but not for laughs. Although Shore's line "" just because were in a BUBBLE, doesn't mean we can't cause any TROUBLE."" Is worth the torment."
1,"Can you spell Abomination, Bud-Dy?","This flick makes Flash Gordon look like high art. That I can't get The Committments on DVD but this thing is available proves that there is no justice. Shame on everyone involved in this movie and shame on all of you who give this movie a good review. This movie is a blemish on the Memory of Mr. Shore and his body of work and...oh, he's still alive. That poor man.Update: You can now purchase the Commitments on DVD. And even though someone pointed out that this film features Kyle Minogue in a bathing suit, it remains the suck. If you want Kylie, go see anything else with Kylie in it."
5,Great Band,"This is some of the best heavy metal I have heard in a long time.I have never gotten into New Age Metal because I like to hear musicians that actually have some kind of musical talent and these guys have a lot of it. These aren't your typical metal band because they have great guitar rifts, a hard hitting drummer, and a vocalist wich actually has some vocal ability. If you are interested then check these guys out. They are worth it."
4,"Not as good as Enlighten the Darkness, but still good","I like this band. Very good speed metal. German but they sing in english, unlike Rammstien. I like Enlighten the Darkness. But all three are good. More classic METAL than most bands nowadays."
4,germany does it better,"bleed is a perfect listen until the 9th song 'liquid angel' comes on---a very generic ballad. my cd has 3 xtra songs on it---'memories' which a very good song, 'nightmare' which is definite ear candy, but is on border of reality cd, this i dont understand and 'temple of the king' which is a rainbow with dio song thus it cant be an improvement-----grade a songs include(bleed, never, follow me part 2, addicted to serenity, and surrender...."
3,This shows that Angel Dust is on their way to greatness.,"Enlighten the Darkness shows they have reached complete greatness. Bleed is a very good album, but since I first heard Enlighten The Darkness and can't believe what a perfect album it is Bleed is of less calibre. Angel Dust is one of the most amazing bands I have ever seen live and they get better with every album. I cant wait for thier new one in the later end of 2001."
5,Numero Uno,"I always dug Talking Heads but had the case of being born too late to really see them come into fruition. In my life I'd heard a bunch of singles and none of the other songs on the albums. I decided to go back through starting with this album, since it was the first, and hearing singles like psycho killer on here was really cool but mainly hearing the songs I'd never heard."
1,Save your money- This book is awful.,This book is just terrible. I bought it as a reference and to so that I wouldn't have to write down everything from dance class. But upon reading it I find almost every dance is presented in ways I have never been taught or seen practiced in any of the clubs here in San Antonio. I think maybe the Salsa step was the same and some the rumba but all the other dances just look wrong. Also the dance frames shown are the type of holds I have been taught as wrong. ( hand on the poor girls kidney instead of higher up.) In terms of the step being taught the diagrams and descriptions are not clear and many times they will use a term like Ball-Flat without defining the term anywhere in the book.Overall a very poor effort- I wish I had not spent the money on it.
5,Plant P blows my mind!,"Are you kidding me? This album is one of the all time greatest forgotten classics from the early MTV days. Why me, Power tools, King for a day, Static.....Excellent stuff. Got hold of this beauty years ago and play it all the time. If you like this, get Tony Carey's Some Tough City and his first album I won't be home tonight. They're awesome too. How many of you knew that Carey was the keyboard player for RAINBOW in the 70'swith Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio. Same quality talent, but this album is one of a kind for sure."
5,Goes Beyond Being An Early MTV Favorite !,"While many have compared Planet P Project to other prog rock bands one thing that still amazes me is how fresh the material still sounds ! Carey was able to produce an album that could convey a space or futuristic rock theme without relying on pure cold synthesized gimmickry that was prevalent in the early 80's. It's awesome 80's early rock;pure and simple. On the whole this is one album that has been a favorite of mine all these years due to it's atmospheric and rich-hook laden lyrics and musicianship. Fans of Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and even Enigma may be quite intrigued by this now 20 year old release with one of it's most captivating early MTV videos of Why Me ?..."
4,Remember the video?,"Years ago on some obscure TV show I saw the video with the exploding space suit for ""Why Me?"" After a long search I finally found the album on vinyl. Worth buying just for that song alone."
5,Glad tp find this!,"Glad to find this! I Love Planet P! Wish there were more bands like this, but what can you say!"
4,Out There on another planet,"I remember when Planet P Project first release the debut lp. It was something that was really hard to label for sure. Then I went and purchased the CD in the 90's. The sound was OK and did not offer any additional bonus tracks. This re-master with bonus tracks is just, as Dick Vitale would say, ""awesome baby."" While some of the songs have a slowed tempo you really have to appreciate how well crafted the tunes are. Sadly, Planet P really did not do anything that came close to this release commercially or creatively. This IS the CD to have with the bonus tracks and it being remastered shows the true strengths of this release."
5,"Mysterious, haunting and simply great !!","I was only about 13 years old if that when 'Why Me' splashed onto MTV and captivated me immediately. Not just the video (is so cool !!) but the song itself !! The intro gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. A good buddy of mine, who is about 10 years older than me, and I would also talk about this tune 'Why Me' and how great it was. We searched flea markets,record stores everywhere for the album or cassette. One day in 1997 our local radio station here in Orlando played it !! It had been YEARS since i heard it. Ironically and oddly enough I was poking around at a music store about a year later and bada bing ! there was PPP on CD ! Mind you 'Why Me' was the only tune I heard from the album and so I got one for me and my buddy. I was floored by how good the rest of the album(CD) was .. 'Static' to me is such a killer tune ... matter of fact I am signing off to go crank it up !! Seee Yaaaa"
5,The album has been glued to my turntable for 15 years!,I cannot add anything because this CD speaks for itself. A throwback to when FM radio programming was done on a local scale and the owner didn't own six of the stations on the dial. I would have paid twice the price.
4,This one this year....,"...the other one next year. I'm referencing my ""Writer's Handbook 2004"" daily as I search for markets for my writing and hints, tips, and direction from established writers for how to sell to those markets. It's got good info and it's well organized. I have found some of the web sites listed to be defunct, but I think that's the nature of the Web. ""The other one"" is ""Writer's Market."" I'm ordering the 2005 edition of that book. Double coverage."
2,Disappointing,"Not much here. I was looking for more than what's offered in this book/CD titled ""Blues Dobro"" - as in more on how to play blues music on my dobro. The book is filled with lots of basic, beginner stuff and lots of snapshot photos of the author playing at various clinics, workshops, etc. It should more appropriately be titled, ""Beginner Dobro info and bad photos of Doug"" Even the actual blues licks and pieces that are included in the book are too elementary to be of much use to anyone other than someone working through their first two or three dobro lessons."
4,Rebirth = The Chrysalids,"""Rebirth"" is in fact the very same book as ""The Chrysalids"". Someone must have figured the new title would sell better. Either way, it's an excellent book. Reminds me A LOT of ""A Night of Watching"", the story of Denmark under the Nazis. That was true, this is fiction, but human nature - good and bad - doesn't change. Real villians, real heroes. I always hoped they would go back for the girls. Yes, we need a sequel!Check out the rating and reviews under ""The Chrysalids"". Read it soon."
5,Scary,I loved it. I enjoy William Hartwell and Jacqueline Hill together. It is simple and entertaining. It is a classic.
2,doctor who,This episode was not that great. There are four episodes and to watch them you need to go to the special features to watch. It was poorly written.
3,Not exactly what I was execting,"I guess I was expecting more. I must not have understood correctly. I thought because it says ""The William Hartnell Years 1963-1966"" at the bottom, there should have been more episodes. But there is only three. The three that makes up story nine 'Planet of Giants'. My bad. I will make sure I understand what I am getting before I spend my money."
3,"Not the finest example of DOCTOR WHO, but still great fun.","While perhaps not the finest example of DOCTOR WHO in the 1960s (the serial suffers from a weak plot and a story that was difficult to carry out convincingly on the series' limited budget and production schedule), PLANET OF GIANTS is still great fun.Also worth noting here (and not mentioned in the Editorial Review) is that the surviving film prints for Episodes One and Two have been restored, and given the appearance of the videotape the serial was originally broadcast from. (Episode Three was broadcast from a film print, and has been left unaltered.) It's difficult to explain the difference, but you'll know it when you see it; it adds a nice sense of the experience of watching the serial when it was first aired."
5,Pony Clamps are great!,"I have 4 of these and use them for pre-assymbly, as well as glue-up assymbly of mitered joints.I'm surprised nobody else has done a review of them before me. I've used them for years and years now."
2,The clamps are actually pretty great...,"I have a set of these clamps, and outside of the adjustment bars having a tendency to bend due to their size... which is pretty unavoidable... they are great clamps. But... a 3 pack? Seriously? Not 4, but 3? That makes no sense!"
5,Beautiful,"This album is exactly what you expect from this lady, smooth, cool and entertaining, a great ""Sunday afternoon"" album easy listening, full and rich."
4,"A Beautiful, Peculiar Album","If this had been The Pretenders' first album, it would probably have been considered one of the best debuts ever. However,Pretenders 1 was an awesome debut, and Pretenders 2 suffered from unnecessary comparisons to it. Only ""Bad Boys Get Spanked"" is overtly a rewrite(of Tattooed Love Boys, so I docked them a star)There are huge chunks of great stuff on this record! Especially ""Talk of the Town"",""Birds of Paradise"",""Message of Love"",""Waste not Want not"",""I Go To Sleep"",""Pack It Up"",""The English Roses"",and ""Day after Day"". I truly miss James Honeyman-Scott, and Pete Farndon. Their expertise shines here, just like the first album, and Chrissie is a true original, and always fascinating. The whole thing is tied together by one of rock's greatest drummers, Martin Chambers. All in all a truly heartfelt and melodic enigma."
5,Better than the 1st!,"Any album that includes Talk of the Town is good enough for me, but there are so many other great songs on it such as The English Roses and Birds of Paradise that it feels like a greatest hits package. It is hard to believe that after their great debut they topped it with their second recording. I love Chrissie Hynde."
3,"prompt delivery, so-so product","the product was delivered promptly, but the skin itself isn't what I had expected. the screen protector fell off easily and I have since lost it."
4,Observation,"This item is a part of a graduation gift, so I really didn't open it. It doesn't look how I expected it to look. I could not see the belt clip, but I'm pretty sure it is enclosed. There is one thing that puzzles me, I didn't receive a owner's manual about this product. I seriously rely on them, especially when it is a gift for someone else. An owner's manual or a product information guide or paper would have really helped!"
1,I thought it would work for vision M 60G,"Creative said 60G is 3mm thicker than 30G. Assumed the case would strecth. But I guess it didn't properly.I have never been able to even ""power on"" Zen with this cover on :-(. I slipped on the cover after powering on the Zen, but I couldnt get it to recognize ""finger presses"" => could not use this in any way yet.. So this buy was practically useless for me."
3,"Good, could be better","First off, the case itself is fairly durable and fits snuggly to the player. Yeah, that's just the case. If you've been sold over on the extras, hold it right there. Secondly, it doesn't ship with the 3 piece LCD screen protectors, just the main screen shield that is supported in the two top corners and opens from the bottom. The stand is more than flimsy, I've already taken it off after one day of use, and the armband doesn't look trusty.The case does what it does, and it's relatively cheap, but the screen could use better protection from something safer than the protector given, and the other two accessories aren't anything special, nor useful."
4,Good cover at a good price,"I bought the purple cover that comes with the belt clip, kickstand and LCD screen protectors. I think it's great. The case fits well, although the printed symbols don't line up exactly with the symbols on the player and it is a little slick. The belt clip did take a minute to figure out but once you discover it screws off it's not a problem to attach. The kickstand allows the player to stand up on my desk so I can see the information scroll by as the music plays. The screen protectors prevent scratches. I think the people complaining about scratches had the case with plastic cover, not the LCD screen protectors. (PCMicrocenter.com has both versions if you want to compare) I like the cover and would recommend it to others."
4,Great Value,"The skin is too thick, but it is durable. The covers are nice and the plastic shield is an innovative feature. My player will not fit in the dock with the skin on.I would have rather had a clear skin."
2,OK but could be much better,"Like the other reviewers, I did have some problems attaching the beltclip. Some sort of instructions would have been nice. Within days, I lost the screen protector (because it doesn't stay on very well) and from what I read, that was a good thing because it may have saved my screen from scratches. So basically, the case was goos for one thing only - the belt clip."
1,Protectective Silicone Skin Case,"I wish there was a negative star option. I bought this stupid case and wasn't even able to use it. While sliding it on (or should I say wrestling it on) the case tore! I even had to reset my Vision as it got fritzed during said beatdown process. I don't know what else to tell you to buy, but DON'T get this."
4,Surprisingly well designed belt clip,"The other attributes and detriments of this product are discussed well enough in other reviews so I will stick to my most pleasant surprise in using the skin.The belt clip, at first glance, looks flimsy and can be confusing to assemble, but once on it is one of the best I have ever used.It places the balance at the top of the clip, so it doesn't easily topple off if clipped on a pocket, or loose clothing. (Which has been a beef of mine with belt clips all the way back to the days of the walkman.)Also, (my favorite feature) it has a quick release tab that allows you detach and reattach the player to the clip without excessive fumbling around at your belt.For my money and my needs, this has been an excellent purchase."
4,Awesome,"This item is an awesome steal. I love it, it's handy, cute and affordable. I will definitely be buying more for my new creative which I am truly enjoying."
3,Did its job i suppose,"I've had this case for almost five months.... IT was alright... i mean it was on but the little window on it came off and I've lost it probably somewhere around the two month mark, so my screen really wasn't protected well. and with that missing dust still managed to weasel its way underneath (having taken it off for the first time since putting it on) I dunno. I wasn't expecting the world with this. So... i guess it boils down to i don't love it... i don't think I'd buy it again anytime soon."
3,Skin is good investment,The skin I bought fit really well and now I don't need to worry about anything getting scratched.
2,"fits, but discolors quickly","As others have reported, the case fits properly, but I'm a bit disappointed in the material used. First, it's on the slick side -- I had a similar case for a different player that had more grip to it, giving it a much more secure feeling in the hand. Second, the material bordering the screen discolored almost immediately; within a day it went a light yellowish brown. Not the end of the world, but the case is supposed to be light blue and I wonder if it will get worse with use."
2,Buyer beware,"The Kroo Protective Silicone Skin was at first a great protectant against scratches, fingerprints, etc.--until I took my Vision M out of the case. Small dust particles and debris entered through the slide-touch opening, and completely destroyed the acrylic surface. Now I have to purchase a cleaner, and even that may not be enough to remove all the scratches this case has caused. On top of that, the metal stand has two rubber tubes that keep the player upright--in time, these tubes will stretch, eventually rendering the stand useless (the tubes will roll back, causing the player to lay prone).I give it two stars because I can still keep it in the case, I guess?Thank you for reading my review."
1,no screen protectors,"Half the reason I chose this product was to get the included screen protectors, which weren't included."
3,It worked ok,The kickstand and arm band are a joke but the clip works great. The protection from the case is good. It is pain to plug any cords into the mp3 player with the case on and its tough to get on and off. There are better ones out there but this one is ok.
1,Worthless Piece of Junk,"I bought this product shortly after investing in a Creative Zen Vision M 60gb, so suffice to say I wanted to protect my investment. The very first time I used this product as an armband on a short mile and half run with the arm band properly secured, the skin broke, it literally tore apart and my mp3 player went crashing to the hard pavement never to work again. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. I was able to get a new Zen from the manufacturer because it was still under warrenty but the process was long and drawn out. Avoid this skin, its not even worth the one star I gave it."
2,wrong item given to me,"I was very unsatisfied with the item given to me. It was supposed to be a hoodie, and it turned out to be a t-shirt."
2,Vest,"I have seen much nicer vests for the same price, this vest is very cheap looking and not as shown in pictures. I would not buy another product from this company"
4,My grandmother loved it!,"What to get for an elderly person? I'm often posed with the question around the holidays; when it comes to buying for my 93yr old grandmother. Until, I found this product on Amazon. My grandmothers tastes are very simplistic and certain fabrics can cause irritation on her sensitive skin. Because of this, I don't like to spend a lot of money on clothing she may or may not like. Three years ago I bought this as a Christmas present and she loved it! Loved it so much; that I'm buying it again for her this year. The vest was more than I expected. The fabric was not as cheap as I thought it might be, actually very nice and very durable. My grandmothers been wearing this vest for three years, just about everyday and they are now showing signs of being worn. Not too bad for a 24 dollar product in my opinion."
2,Cheap,The fabric is cheap and the fit is very boxy. Ok for everyday but not for work and certainly not for dressy occasions.
2,Disappointed in Michigan,"There are very VERY short snippets by Charleton Heston, Tom Selleck and Chuck Norris, though the picture is VERY misleading on the DVD cover. Many short shippets by various people including everyday people, and the DVD is very short. Okay DVD if you can get it for $1 or less, plus postage, otherwise save your money for something else."
1,But it's NOT a comedy !?!?!?,"I was enjoying this and laughing lots. Hysterically funny spoof. Then I realized it was not intended as a spoof, which made it even funnier.This movie is so dreadfully bad it's great! From the opening ""Hhhaaaiiiirrrryyyy"" I knew I was in for a rare treat. And the movie does not disappoint, as long as you don't take it seriously at all. There's nothing in this flick to make it even a moderately good action/adventure or suspense flick. Nothing even remotely Hitchcockian to it. But I couldn't stop laughing! Just kept getting funnier and funnier -- worse and worse! I love it."
3,Good Reading,I read the book Silent Night by Mary Higgins Clarke. This book was very intriguing and had a well defined and played out plot. The details of the story were also very well organized. I think this book is a good for the more mature reader. Ricky Gipson
5,I loved this book !,The book Silent night was one of the best books I have ever read it kept me turning the pages from beging to end.
2,BOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read!!!As a MHC fan,I was really disappointed. It was very boring and predictable.I only finished it because I'm required to read a certain amount of books for school.It seemed like a good story, but I was very wrong!!!If your looking for a good mystery, turn to another one of MHC's books."
2,Predictable and boring.,"I found this book predictable, its plot unbelievable, and frankly it really bored me. However, if you're a Mary Higgins Clark fan, go to it."
4,IMPRESSIVE,"This was the very first book I read of Mary Higgins Clark. I found it quite interesting. Not many books can hold my interest, but this one kept me reading. I enjoyed it very much and am now reading another one of her books. All I can say is, it takes a lot to be a good writter and Mary Higgins Clark has got the talent."
2,A major disappointment for Higgins fans,This book surprized me: never was a book more obviously written for the Chrstmas gift market. Totally predictably unbelievable events bring this short book to an early death. A big gyp
2,Bland,"After hearing my friends rave about Clark's books, I decided to pick up this book to see what all the fuss was about. Unfortunately, it was pretty much what I suspected. The characters were shallow and one-sided and the story was sappy. I didn't bother finishing it. I guess it's alright if you're looking for a quick read and want to turn your brain off."
3,Silent Night,"I've never read a book by Mary Higgins Clark before, so I decided to try this one since it had a Christmas theme and I wanted a holiday book. It was a fast and easy read and although it was based at Christmas time, the actual storyline didn't have much to do with Christmas itself. Overall though, it was a decent read, it kept me interested and I liked the somewhat predictable ending."
3,Hit the spot,"This was an impulse Christmas read and it was exactly what I wanted: short and sweet. Though truthfully, the only thing Christmas has to do with the story is to act as a setting. It's not like the bad guy has some big moment of redemption. Regardless, it was a quick little read that hit the spot."
2,Not as good as I expected,"A father diagnosed with cancer, a mother lost in grief, a little lost looking for hope, and a mad man who cares for no one but him self: that's how this book starts off. It's Christmas time and The Dornans are in New York getting treatment for their father, when tragedy strikes; the medal that is supposed to bring him luck is stolen. There is only one witness to this crime, little Christopher Dornan, and he runs after the thief. What will happen? Read this book and find out. This was not the best book that I have ever read. It was kind of slow to get started and to me it never really picked up. To me the character of Cally is not very deep and I like characters to have depth. Read this book to get your own options.Suspense"
4,Silent Night,"It's an excellent book and even if I speek french and that I'm not very good in english, I appreciated a lot this novel. I also read Loves music ,loves to dance and I liked it. According to me, Mary Higgings Clark is an extraordinary author and I advise you to read her book if you can."
2,"A sappy, predictable, story using christmas as a backdrop","This is the first Mary Higgins Clark book that I have read and it will probably be the last. It is a predictable story that reads much like a ""made for T.V. movie"". It is a quick read that requires a minimal amount of thinking. The characters are not developed, the plot is boring, and I disliked the use of a christmas theme to give the plot an overly emotional tone. Not a book I would reccommend unless the reader enjoys mindless novels"
4,"The powers of love, faith, and courage.","The powers of love, faith, and courage have rarely been tied together in an exciting suspense story. But in the novel ""Silent Night"" by Mary Higgins Clark, she managed to do just that.The setting in Christmas Eve in New York City. After Tom Dornan arrives there to recieve a life-saving operation for his leukemia, his wife Catherine and two sons come to visit from Omaha. While Catherine and her two boys watch a musician on the street, Catherine's youngest son, Brian, witnesses someone taking her wallet without her realizing it. The wallet had a St. Christopher medal in it that saved his grandfather's life in World War Two. Brian hopes that giving it to his dad will save his life as well.Brian follows the woman to her apartment and gets caught up in something far bigger than he expected. When kidnapped by escaped murderer Jimmy Siddons, Brian find's his courage and faith tested in this heartwarming novel that is great for all ages."
3,A Night that is Anything but Silent!,"Author Mary Higgins Clark writes an effective but predictable, formula novel in twenty-five clever little chapters. The plot is about a little boy(Brian) who is kidnapped after he runs after a women who steals his mother's wallet. Included in it is a precious St. Christopher medal; a family heirloom, which is to be given to his sick father to make him better. This is the third Mary Higgins Clark novel I have read; I find it odd that all the ones I have read are all are about kidnappings. (""A Stranger Is Watching,"" ""Deck the Halls"") Surely, the Queen of Suspense can find more effective material to write about. Still ""Silent Night"" would make a decent television movie."
3,Predictable,It is ok for a quick read. The story is quite predictable. No thrills or suspense. You can read it if you don't have anything better to do.
4,Good Short Story,"This was not one of my favorites by Clark, but it was a good short story. The characters were very well written. I read this book in two nights, I could not wait to see how it all ended! If you like short stories, read this one!"
1,Capturing Enigma,"The story of HMS Petard's capture of an enigma machine and related codebooks probably deserves no more than a chapter in a history of World War II. Whilst it is a story of great bravery by a few individuals, it is a lightweight story. Time and again, the author repeats the basic story of the ship, its crew, and their actions. Frankly, there just isn't enough material to fill a book or to hold a reader's interest. Save your money!"
3,"Okay book, Beautiful Pictures","As a counselor some of the kids I work with like the veggies, while others find it weird and difficult to understand why they are having all of these feelings. With small children 6 and under this can be helpful."
4,Charming & fun!,"I wanted this book for a while, as I thought it would be a fun book to show my 3-year old son about different kinds of feelings. I liked the book a lot. It's very funny and creative. My only complaint is that the paper is very thin, and he crumples the pages easily -- and maybe that there's too many peppers :)But for the price, I wouldn't let those small complaints stand in your way -- a great addition to the preschool library!"
3,how are you peeling,how are you peeling is a great book. me and my friend was reading it and we were just reading it for fun and it is has very good ideas. i really cant belive somebody would come you with such great food ideas. i really seen anything like that except when i went to my reading teachers room on the first day of school. it has other series but this one is my 2nd favorite one. and my first favorite one is the one about dogs. i just love dogs.
5,Wonderful learning tool for toddlers!,"My son absolutly loves this book and the uniquie photos of fruits and veggie are excellent for counting, learning colors, judging feelings and moods, and learing about healthy foods. Beautiful hard cover and nice glossy pages. We own this book in 2 languages! Because we get so much use from this book, we bought the other titles by this author and enjoy them as well."
5,One for everyone on my list!,"This is the best -- and funniest -- picture book this year. It is utterly delightful. Only problem is... I'll never be able to cut into a lemon or an onion again without seeing these funny faces! I'm giving this book to everyone on my Christmas list this year, adults and kids alike."
5,Lots of fun!! I'm buying a supply to give as birthday gifts,"It would be hard for any adult or child to look through this book without smiling - a lot! Not to mention, it's a great way to discuss feelings with a young child. A meaningful topic presented in a whimsical way. Order this for the child in your life and the child in you!"
5,Great Picture Book for all ages!,Adults and kids alike will thoroughly enjoy looking through this book and seeing the expressions these fruits and vegetables have to share with us! You will never look at 5 a day the same again!
5,A Great Artist and Fun Book,The fruits and vegetables come to life with emotions that brought smiles to my daughter and my face. Extremely clever and beautifully arranged on the pages. We hope there is a followup.
5,Great for teaching feelings / facial expression,"I love this book. I was inspired to buy it because I had a really cute calendar with similar images (real vegetables arranged to look like expressive human faces). What I didn't expect, was that I was able to use it to work on sound formation (mouth shapes) and social skills (facial expressions) with my students!"
4,a cute little book perfect as a stocking stuffer!,"a lovely book, i think the photos are great though i was left wondering if the veggies were treated before shooting! chalk one up for ""otto focus""...."
5,Amazing,"Saxton Freymann and Joost Elffers are playing with their food and we are the lucky recipients of their charming and amusing latest effort, How Are You Peeling? Foods With Moods. The simple rhyming text discussing emotions we all feel at times...happy, sad, grumpy or worried, shy, insecure, amused or confused...to name a few, compliments the amazing fruit and vegetable sculptures. It's hard to believe an onion, kiwi, radish or mushroom (to name but a few) could express such emotions, but they do. A vibrant, visual treat the entire family will enjoy reading and discussing, this is a book that should find its way onto everyone's bookshelf!"
2,Another crass moneygrab book,"Old interviews rehashed from the magazine. Just another example of The Comics Journal trying to wring big sack of cash out of dead artists (not all of them I know). There's some nice artwork here, that's unavoidable, but it would be better served in a book by a publisher that respects these artists, not one that's just trying to cash in."
5,Amazing Tapping,"""Broadway Melody of 1940"" features some amazing tapping. It is worth the purchase price just for the final 10 minutes of the movie! Eleanor Powell is a delight to watch, and is the perfect tap partner for Fred Astaire!"
5,It Doesn't Get Much Better than This!,"For once I agree with Frank Sinatra, who said ""You can wait around and hope, but you'll never see the likes of this again!"" Scene 9 (Jukebox Dance) is an absolute gem which deserves to be enshrined in tap-dancing history forever."
4,Great tap,Bought this just for the great tap sequence at the end. Very dated story but great for Astaire (and now Powell) fans!
3,Classic Tap With Astaire and Powell,"Fred Astaire's first post-Ginger effort was this entertaining MGM musical - pairing the dance legend with the incomparable Eleanor Powell. ""Broadway Melody of 1940"" will be remembered for Astaire and Powell's exhilarating tap duet in Cole Porter's ""Begin the Beguine"" and their equally impressive ""Jukebox Dance."" Great chemistry between the two stars, yet it was their only film together. Likable support from George Murphy and MGM's production polish help override a weak script."
4,Underappreciated,"The art direction in this movie is incredible. It is one of the ultimate ""New York as nightlife fantasyland"" films (like the 1936 Melody, and Astaire's own ""Swing Time""). The DVD replicates the silky B&W images just fine, especially the finale, which looks incredible on a big screen TV. Though Astaire tended to blow this off as ""one of those big Metro things"", it is a fun movie with a cool Big Band feel and a dream soundtrack, and Eleanor Powell is a revelation--it's too bad she isn't as well known today. Though the silly harlequin ballet doesn't really belong, I'll still take this over the pretentious MGM musicals of the 50s."
5,A Classic Among Recorder Instructional Method Books,"I purchased this as a used book. It arrived in like-new condition and was delivered promptly. This is a good instructional method book for someone who has some previous understanding of basic music theory. It is the method developed by the real Trapp Family Singers depicted in the famous ""Sound of Music"" movie. It is a fast-paced approach covering a lot in each of the twelve lessons. A person who completes these twelve lessons will have developed an impressive proficiency skill-level on the Recorder. Two versions are available and are distinguished by an arrow on the bottom-right of the cover pointing to either ""Book M-1"" (for C Soprano/Tenor Recorders) or ""Book M-2"" (for F Alto/Sopranino/Bass Recorders)."
4,The music Trapp,"This is ""the"" classic beginning recorder method -- it's been around forever and is still, IMO, one of the best & most useful. Of course, like any intro. method it's best used in the context of lessons or at least mentoring/coaching."
4,It's funny how a book about eroticism has so many reviews...,"""The supreme value of his testimony lies in its ability to disturb us. It forces uss to reexamine thoroughly the basic problem which haunts our age in different forms:the true relation between man and man."" - Simone de Beauvoir""Justine is the most abominable book ever engendered by the most depraved imagination."" - Napoleon BonaparteWas Napoleon really disturbed by these novels (or did he test out these static plots on his own)? How unsuccessful could this book really be if someone like Naploeon was repulsed by the story of 'Justine'? And why do so many people comment on this book, as opposed to other books that have a higher sales rank according to Amazon.com, when only a couple thousand copies have been purchased? Aren't you curious?"
4,For a limited audience.,"De Sade's work is ambiguous, and so is this book. It could be described as a 'poem# to sadomasochism, and if you are into this sort of thing buy it."
3,obsession,"After having seen the film ""Quivers"" about de Sade with Geoffrey Rush, I was intrigued and wanted to learn more about the writer by reading his writing. The guy is obsessed with sodomy--it gets tiresome. His writing, though intelligently presented, is eclipsed by his incredibly juvenile and obsessive sensibilities. Not a favourite tome."
1,A very boring read,"I understand that if you are young and in jail, as was Sade, you can dream all kinds of sexual fantasies. The dreams of the marquis de Sade belong to that category. However these dreams are not edited: this is not literature, it is repetitive and frankly not exciting at all for a normal person. Out of jail, Sade had a disorderly life, attacking his young servants and being, even for a 18th century nobleman,- at that time, noble people could get away with a lot of sins- absolutely repugnant. We remember Sade because he gave his name to a type of disorder, but he is forgettable as a character and as an author. It is hard to believe that the monster was born in the south of France in the beautiful and charming city of Lacoste. The castle belongs now to Pierre Cardin estate and half the town is an art school."
1,Poor binding...good book,"This is a great book, but it fell apart on me after page 20. The binding stinks ! Don't buy it if you want a book that will stay together for you...I will be looking for a hardcover edition to replace this."
1,cardboard characters,"A came to this ""work of literature"" via a true work of literature of the same name, ""Justine"" by Lawrence Durrell. M. de Sade was quoted extensively throughout Durrell's ""Alexandria Quartet."" I became intrigued. I am now disappointed. This failed attempt to turn a life-philosophy into a novel (if that was even the goal?) De Sade could have used an editor (I guess no one wanted to share a cell with him), the book is extremely repetitive. The characters are not people, just mouth pieces for De Sade and his detractors. As a work of literature it is as big a failure as Ayn Rand's literary efforts to advocate her libertine philosophy in the economic sphere with ""Atlas Shrugged."" You may complain that literature wasn't his aim. If so, then it must be shocking? novel? not anymore. Why read it? cultural literacy I guess."
5,legendary,"justine is of the greats from the marquis de sade. people who arent familiar with de sade should begin here. this buy (book in this format) is the best version i have seen of justine. there are other plays de sade wrote, other stories such as the priest and the dying man and philosophy in the bedroom. from sade's name, derives the term sadism. no other man on earth could ever deserve the title more than de sade. read 120 days of sodom, if you're in doubt. this man wrote the most vile stories of all time. this is a title that he still retains to this day in literary circles. while it is bleak and dark and abhorrent violence and sexual depravity run the table with de sade, as far as writing goes, the man is a great writer. his passion for writing is seen in the movie ""quills"" with geoffrey rush, which is a great film. if you think you are ready for de sade, start here. but be warned. it is not for the light hearted - in ANY way shape, form, or fashion."
2,Kindle Edition is Poorly Constructed,"This review doesn't refer to the writing itself, but rather the clumsy Kindle edition released for this product. The Kindle book seems to be constructed from a scan of the paper book, which has an ornate, faux-calligraphic font. This font, given the screen resolution of the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite, is almost unreadable at a normal size.Don't buy this Kindle edition."
5,the visionary sade,"Sade's spittle and bile for polite society is never on better display than here. As he probably would have predicted, we've become worse and more hypocritical than ever before. Progress is a myth; we like to pretend we've become transgressive, but in fact we've only turned sex and violence into cartoons - in fact we're scandalized more than ever by the real. This is particularly true among the progressives, leftists, and liberal priests who like to walk around and prattle about liberty while being as oppressive as any regressive hypocrite - the difference is we, the left, have managed to push our fears underground, where they've grown uglier and larger than we can imagine.Sade would have loved to be alive today in our culture of prudery. If Sade were working today, there'd be some truly revolutionary art . . . not to take anything away from Justine or Philosophy in the Bedroom."
5,Justine is brilliant,Justine deffinatly knows her way around the bedroom.My god it is fantastic just how amazing she is. I wish i had found her sooner.Thank you justine for everything you have done for me. I dont know where i'd be without you.I Love You Justine
1,It was so way off base from Erotism that it is just vulger,So much for the Father S-M. To call him that is insane. . . i hope no one takes De Sade to heart or someone will get hurt. . . .
5,Review for BookNews,"From Booknews: -- looks at the political thought of the two contemporary 20th-centuries philosophers<-->Husserl the founder of phenomenology and Collingwood one of its most read writers. Considers them together because they were addressing the same historical epoch and similar audiences, because the political philosophy of both has been neglected by scholars, and in order to place them in the mainstream liberal political tradition rather than in its more radical fringes. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)"
4,Still Good,"During its original run, Futurama was one of the best comedies on television, and its return from an unjust cancellation was, to say the least, welcome. Fan opinion on the revived basic-cable Futurama was split- some hailed it as a return to form, some called for the execution of all involved. Season 6 will be no less controversial, I'm sure, but in my opinion it was ""pretty good"".There's not much to say plot-wise: if you're reading this review, you've probably watched and loved the first five seasons, and the sixth is much like. I do have to say that it's a drop in quality from the previous, but you'll get more than your fill of the crazy adventures of Fry, Leela, Bender and the whole Planet Express crew in this 13-episode set. Highlights include the Zoidberg-centric ""The Tip of the Zoidberg"", ""Cold Warriors"" and the non-canon anthology ""Reincarnation"". I would recommend purchasing this DVD to any Futurama fan or fan of comedy in general."
5,Finally,So glad they decided to go ahead and proceed with the 6th season. As funny if not funnier than the originals.
3,glichy,"other then the fact that they have been produced of bad quality discs Volume six of Futurama is really ""futurastic!"" really awesome."
5,Great Gift,"My friend loves this series. So I purchased 5, 6, and 7. The price is great compared to stores. I was able to get all 3 for under $50."
5,Awesome!,These episodes continue bringing the high quality that made the show so great. A must have for all Futurama fans.
4,Keep 'em coming!,"Not quite as great as the old stuff, but some really funny stuff in here! If you like this show, get this season."
5,Still tied for my favorite TV show ever,"Along with Arrested Development, Futurama is my favorite TV show ever. Volume Six is another great addition to the series."
5,"It's Futurama, duh","I am so glad the guys from Futurama decided they didn't need a network and continued making episodes even after they were cancelled. They proved they had a strong enough following to survive and a good enough product that was picked up by a smart network in Comedy Central. We all win with these 2 new seasons, and this one won an Emmy! Can't wait for more Futurama in the future. Best cartoon ever!"
4,First Season after Hiatus,"This was the first season ""Back"" for Futurama, after being cancelled on FOX, and the season starts off a little snarky / vindictive, but ramps up quickly to some excellent episodes. As always, this show is a great buy."
3,No Shakespeare here,"If awards were given for exploitation movie titles, this one would qualify for Lifetime Achievement recognition. In this 1988 send-up of ""splatter"" films, female members of a blood cult pose as prostitutes and carve up their share of over-amorous males. With a title like this, you know exactly what kind of fare you're in for right from the start, so there's no point in expressing aesthetic outrage over any of the film's shortcomings. (This is not WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS, so keep your complaints to yourself.) Of special note is the participation of perennial ""Scream Queen"" Michelle Bauer, billed here as Michelle McLellan. Unlike some other SQs who perfunctorily scream and expose their breasts on cue, Bauer always conveys a sense of giddy enthusiasm in her performances; she actually seems to relish the idea of shrieking at the top of her lungs, getting splashed with fake blood, and cavorting buck nekkid. You've gotta love a trouper like that."
3,About the DVD,"The picture quality of this release is not that bad(by HCH standards) it's a bit grainy and dark, but not to bad. It has been cropped into a widescreen format, compairing this to my PAL video release it crops off a tiny bit at the bottom, a chunk at the top(although this area of screen is seldom used) and it does give you extra picture information on the right side of screen. The extras are fun but just not enough, it has interviews with the stars and Fred Olen Ray presents the disc(reminds me of the troma dvds). It's an okay disc and MILES better than the coaster UK disc but it's a little high on price, if it were a ... disc like Deathstalker II(another good disc) I wouldn't have a complaint. Overall if you like HCH this is the best disc available."

4,"What were you expecting, Casablanca?","""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers."" The name pretty much says it all. When you have a movie with a title like that starring Linnea Quigley, you are not going to get an in depth look at the human condition. If you want a way to kill an hour and a half without turning on your brain, this is for you. Personally, I thought it was a lot of fun. It starts with a detective looking for a missing girl (Quigley) and winds up running afoul of a chainsaw cult led by Gunnar Hansen.The movie does not take itself too seriously. The gore effects are so over the top that they are far from frightening, but rather fun. If you are a fan of 80's B movies, you will not be disappointed. I have never regretted buying this flick."
2,not much fish oil here,"This is the only fish oil I am able to digest without fishy burps amazingly. Since I was a kid I couldn't stand fish oil. I had tried Norweigan, English cod liver oil, salmon oil , Kirkland brand, enteric coated, even those disguised with lemon flavor etc, etc, every single one gave me a fishy burp. I was so shocked with this product, I decided to carefully read the small print on the label and I found that there was no indication that this is actually a fish oil product except on the front of the bottle. It says evening primrose and flaxseed oil which are really from plants. I honestly think maybe they put 10% or so actual fish oil, hence the cheap price. Just saying, you know my opinion."
2,"It is what it is... omega 3,6,9","I purchased this since I have to take a lot of omega 3, so I need to buy in big ammounts... I bought aroung 6 of these packages... good thing is that they only charged me 1 shipping so it is a good buy.Bad thing is that it is omega 3,6,9 and as far as I know I dont need 6 or 9, i only need 3, so do most of you people. So I wrote the manufacturer and seller asking about if its possible to know how much omega3,6,9 it contains and never got any reply.... I wont buy again until I get that information... I already bought another brand."
5,vitamin,This product have a nice price for the 200 softgels.The product is fresh and come very well package.
4,"nice price, no after taste.",The product came quickly and is as described. I have experienced no after taste. I would purchase this product again.
2,"""I've waited a long time for this!""","After ""The Deadly Assassin"", there always seemed to be a story or two in a season that helped fill new Gallifrey/Time Lord continuity. ""Underworld"" is one of them. Giving us the explanation of the Time Lords' noninvervention with other peoples and planets. That's the interesting bit. The rest is a mix of sloppy extras acting, repeated scenes of guards walking and running up and down and some bad CSO that hadn't been seen since the Pertwee era. There's a neat premise with the Minyons looking for their long lost race bank so their culture and people won't disappear. Their race bank is hidden in the middle of the newly born planet protected by the insane computer, the Oracle. Sounds decent, but it just moves at a snail pace. And besides the interior of the Minyons spaceship, it has a REAL cheap feel to the production. Still, there is some humor to help, and the leads, Baker and Jameson are consistent."
4,Apocalypse Culture,"Heady book with a profound impact for thinking types. Well worth the read. Shocking, provocative and memorable. Then again, that's to be expected from Feral House."
2,huh?,"much of this book i just read it and went huh? i just didn't get the point of the whole book. it was an interesting read and right up there with the most unusual, most controversial books that i have read. But in the end it just left a feeling of emptiness. There were points that were so disgusting that it was repulsive, other articles were just plain stupid. if the point of the book is just to shock people it doesn't work, it just leaves the reader wondering what the point of the book was because it isn't that shocking and it only has a few articles that are repulsive. the weird thing is, i want to perhaps read the second apocalypse book. can't explain why."
1,Perhaps the most disgusting book I've ever read,"This book is so bad that my experience with it is the only time in my 66 years that I approached the bookseller I bought it from and asked him to take it off his shelves. The bookseller got all First Amendment about it, but apparently he took a look at it when I suggested that he didn't sell all books and obviously makes a selection of what he wants to sell and to reconsider his decision on this one, as a few days later it (and Apocalypse Culture II) was off his shelves.It has absolutely no redeeming value whatever. Maybe that was the idea, to create a written work that is so bad it is no good at all. So don't buy this book if you hope to gain any sort of insight at all. It's just disgusting.I'm sorry that Amazon hasn't made it possible to give it negative stars. It's terrible. Badly written, too, if that makes any difference."
5,Christmas as you've never celebrated it before!,"Good old Amelia Bedelia! When Christmas is just around the corner, she just has to figure out which one! How can such a simple world turn out to be so complicated for America's favorite young housekeeper?Only hoping to follow directions to the T, Amelia makes a date cake using dates -- but not the fruit kind, the numbers cut from a calendar page! And stuffing stockings for the neighbor's children is sure to be an adventure that defies description!Merry Christmas, Amelia Bedelia is sure to be a favorite for young readers, and a wonderful opportunity to enjoy learning the wonders of word play!Highly recommended!"
2,Not your typical,does not treat Christmas well for young children---stuffing stockings for neighbor kids and strange depiction of Mr Rogers as santa
4,Just what I need.,Came in the time estimated. Strangely via USPS. Cans look big on page small in real life.
2,Expensive and hard to use,"This product is far more expensive than just buying fresh eggs and throwing away the yolk. They are hard to mix well, which makes them unsuitable for direct cooking, as in an omlette, or in situations where the whites must be well beaten before using.In addition, the extremely ""fluffy"" nature of the powder as it is packed makes it very difficult to measure properly. Do you measure it packed or loose? The extreme imprecision of the lousy volume-based directions makes it a tough sell for tricky baked goods, like airy cakes.There are other egg white powders out there that do a far better job for far less money."
3,Freakishly Sticky,"I rarely buy eggs and when I do I have to think of ways to use the leftovers before they spoil. So I bought a container of Just Whites to keep conveniently in the cabinet. I thought it would be great to have around anytime I wanted to make something and not have to go to the store to buy eggs or worry about having more than I needed, but I don't like using this product. The powder is ridiculously sticky, making it difficult to use. When mixing with water like the instructions say the powder simply sticks to the fork or whisk in clumps and won't combine with the liquid. It has replaced egg whites in some baked goods I've used it for but Just Whites has been more of an annoyance than a convenience."
2,wouldn't get this again,i see this might be good for baking and mixing with other dry ingredients but i was hoping it would be more versatile than that.
5,Eggs-actly as described.,"Great product. Very versatile and useful especially for low carb eating. This product is pasteurized for safety, too. The price is best for the case on Amazon."
1,This is sad...,"Where to begin? This is a country album, minus anything interesting or innovative. It is disturbing to see that this mediocre album recieved 'rave' reviews, when it is nothing more than polished karoke night at club country. Lastly, most of the songs sound exactly the same, lending nothing to originality.It's a sad album with sad songs..."
5,One of the Best CDs I've ever listened to,"Great Music, Every song as good or better than the Next, Fantastic Job"
3,dissapointed,"im being generous giving the book 3 stars as i believe it was poorly written and got boring in places to be honest the only thing that really kept me interesed was the continuous insestual relationship between cathy and chris, but it was silly because throughout most of the book cathy is saying she doesn't love chris like that so what does she do at the end???jump back into bed with him!!!!! i still believe their relationship is unique and was pleased when she eventually chose chris we all knew it was gonna happen so what was all that crap with the guys before hand y din't cathy save herself a lot of time and let chris have her at the beginning?? oh well now that they are together i am even more intrigued to how their relationship will develop in the next book so im gonna read that. this book was nothing compared to flowers but read it to get you filled in on the next book which should be better."
5,CAVU Days -- Earning your wings and surviving to enjoy them.,"Col. Weiland has earned his CAVU days after a lifetime of service to his country as a Marine Corps Aviator. This relatively short memoir covers his youth in South Dakota; his decision to join the Corps before Pearl Harbor; and combat tours in ""Cactus"" (Guadalcanal) and subsequent assignment to form VMF-451 and take it into combat. That combat tour was shortened by the Japanese bomber attack of 19 March 1945 on the USS FRANKLIN.Some background research has led me to learn that this memoir is an expansion of a shorter article that Eric Hamel of Pacifica Press (the publisher) encouraged Col. Weiland to write. I am very glad he did. Pat Weiland tells a wonderful story; top of the line writing; tinged with the poignancy of loss.As these WW II era vets climb into their eighties; these personal stories become the more precious.READ THIS BOOK!"
5,To die for......,"I thought the book was fascinating....it was a very good story and I learned many things about enbalming and what must be done when someone dies....and not only that, the ending was a complete surprise.....!"
3,Salute to marx and fell sorry for him.,"First of all my salute to grate marx and salute to his grate mind power,marx you have given us thoughts which is beyond your time and are really revolutionary.but for that you have sacrificed the idols of all time and that is why i fell sorry for you ,a grate scholar of all time and he is not accompaning the principles in BHAGVATGEETA ,if he couldaccompanied that then world is different today for liking of all.Marx is grate human ever lived on planet earth"
3,Not Bad--a campy drive - in type horror flick,"This movie wasn't bad. It's just about a psycho who escapes a mental institution and kills primarily women at a catholic univeristy.The movie moves along quite nice, but doesn't really get into the reason behind the why this psycho kills poeple--guess cuase he's just plan nuts!!I like the grainy ealy 80's look of the film and the clothes and hair are laughable--what's more laughable is that this flick must have been on a real tight budget--for days and nights go by and many of the characters wear the same clothes everyday!!! The gore is typical for the time it was filmed, stabbings, throats slashed and lots of fake blood everywhere....If you like old type B / Drive In Flicks and can get it cheap, it's worth picking up to watch occasionally with some popcorn."
3,I love amazon and the US for having such a variety of DVDs.,Glad to have bought it. I love old slasher flicks and its great to have such a large selection to choose from.
3,electornic fan,this is a great guitar for starters! it even includes a starters kit! so its great for teens of even children to start on!!
2,parents stay away! BRIO is much better and more durable,"We bought both because we were told they were ""compatible"" which they are not (with each other, but both fit the same tracks). Thomas keeps running off the track, can't go up hills without getting stuck on the track, won't fit through Brio tunnels, is made of cheap plastic and runs too fast for my taste (i like my son to be able to interact with his toys). In contrast, our Brio set is well made, has the best accessories, has batteries that are easier to change (& smaller & cheaper) and overall is much more fun to play with."
2,It's not Thomas as we know it!,"Well its not bad and certainly simple to set up and play with. However, its got the wrong number of wheels! As any thomas fan knows the engine is an 0-6-0. The Hornby product is far better, and comes in both clockwork and electric version...."
1,Millionaire,Game is fun for about a few days but gets stale very quick. Fun game to play with a friend or two though.
5,Ignite your own healing,"Dr. Peters presents a thorough foundation for his message - healing is accomplished by individuals who wish to heal. He anchors this in solid research and shares clinical experiences to add depth and meaning to his thesis. After laying the foundation he focuses in more detail on cancer and heart disease as specific examples of illnesses that can be successfully tamed using his combination of conventional treatment and emotional awareness. He includes specific exercises to put his approach into action.This book will be valuable to all who seek wellness, everyone from the apparently healthy to the ""terminally"" ill."
4,all,I was orginally given the CD as a gift and was unsure if I would like it. I am pleased to say the entire CD is both insightful and has a great beat. Now that I have found this artist I hope he continues to produce more CD's in the futhure...
1,Disappointed,"I was expecting this product to half way work, but it doesn't work. I will not be purchasing this product again. It's a waste of money."
4,Well pleased.,Well pleased with the service and quality of the product once received. All handled in a timely manner as well.
1,The author went and put 7 5 star ratings for this book,"Hansen (I presume) went to all of his books, made 6 users and gave the top rating. Check out all the ratings by these reviewers above."
2,Also somewhat disappointed,"I agree with the other slightly disappointed reviewer. The author too often relies on stereotyping, generalizing and anecdotes. I thought, the enneagram refers to the character of individuals. If that is so, how can Jaxon-Bear refer to entire countries as one type if they are made up of highly diverse individuals. Where do drop-outs or regime critics fit in who were born and raised in a country? That is where his stereotyping (mostly negative anyway, i.e. Austrians only bathe once a week) comes in. How can the author consider himself spiritual and still revert to such superficial narrow-mindedness? On the positive side, he does give some valuable insights in childhood dynamics and trauma that would explain fixations."
2,Not that great,"This book provides some interesting insights, but veers away and does not give appropriate credit to Enneagram pioneers. It is inconsistent with other Enneagram topology books."
2,A Bit Disappointing,"Despite high hopes for this book I found it a bit disappointing. The author uses a subjective, anecdotal approach to describing the different types (e.g., ""Females Fours usually have great boots."") as opposed to an objective description of the principles underlying each number. Also, apparently most of his contacts from which he draws his anecdotal descriptions are women (for instance, the section on Childhood Setting for Twos has very little male gender or gender neutral info - it is overwhelmingly geared to females, as most of the book seems to be). An emphasis on the negative aspects of each type while excluding the positive aspects makes for a bit of a depressing read. Some interesting ideas but not enough for me to enthusiastically recommend the book. For those interested in this subject, I'd recommend ""The Wisdom of the Enneagram"" by Riso and Hudson - they actually accomplish what this author set out to do."
5,Pluggger,"This is, without a doubt, the best example yet of intellectual biography. Richardson is masterful at revealing the inner landscape of one of America's great minds. At the same time, he also presents a lively and engaging portrait of the outer life of Henry David Thoreau. Not since Walter Harding has anyone told Thoreau's story so well."
3,Better Than Nothing,"While this is an adequate recording of the opera, it pales in comparison to the old Renata Tebaldi recording. Tebaldi infused life into the role and is still unmatched by either Callas or Caballe. Unfortunately, that recording has still not been issued on CD. This recording is acceptable. Pavarotti has a pretty voice, but lacks the dynamic presence that the role of Enzo seems to call for. The weakest part of the whole recording is the chorus, it sounds as if they were almost as if they were offstage when this recording was made."
3,WESTERN MOVIES,"I LIKE WESTERNS AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES THAT I DID NOT HAVE IN MY COLLECTION. IF YOU LIKE WESTERNS AND DO NOT HAVE THIS ONE, THEN GET IT.WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
3,"Long Riders Is Long On Music, But Not On Plot","I saw this movie for the first time a couple of days ago. What hit me about the movie was the amount of music played in the movie. The movie is fair. Not a movie you would want to repeat several times in your lifetime. Maybe watch once and then move on. The cinematography is fine. It seemed to lack grit. I found it difficult to believe David Carradine as Cole Younger. Frank Keach was good as Jesse James, but brother Stacy Keach was passable as Frank James. I think a better rendition of the story of Jesse James and the Younger brothers was in the movie ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"" made in 1972 as a television film (I believe). Cliff Robertson as Cole Younger and Robert Duvall as Jesse James seemed to be better renditions. The Long Riders is well made, but it seems to be missing something. Just rent it.....and if you really like the movie.....definitely buy it. Investigate the 1972 version with Duvall. Passable to good acting in the Long Riders."
2,Learning how to make a film,"This film is a step above inept, in writing and execution. The acting is decent...but the undeveloped weak script allows the actors no scenes that add up to drama, humor, or any insight to the characters. Scenes happen, end, and another starts with no sense of momentum or cohesiveness. No style in the direction, or sense of meaning in the scenes. Photography OK once in awhile, some boners in others. Music by Ry Cooder was enjoyable...made watching just palatable. Having real brothers, with a good script would have been great...oh well!"
5,The Long Riders,"Great movie, lots of action in the Old West steeing. Impressive cast and great action."
4,Tough and Underrated,"The Long Riders might be the most accurate portrayal of the James/Younger gang on film. James Keach plays Jesse as a severe, violence prone character who robs banks because that's where the money is. It's light years removed from the recent Rob Lowe version ""Frank and Jesse"". Walter Hill didn't whitewash his characters, at least he didn't whitewash them as much as previous and subsequent directors have. Their bloody finale at Northfield Minnesota is presented with no punches pulled. This is a fine, hard little Western. If you've seen the terrible ""Frank and Jesse"" you owe it to yourself to check out this one."
2,Not a serious survey of international printmaking,"I have long looked outside the US for great contemporary printmaking, so when I found this book I was really excited. What a disappointment! The book is dominated by North Americans while nearly ignoring the rest of the world. The real world of printmaking is almost the reverse - there is so much more going on in printmaking outside the U.S. than within it. Merely being a teacher/friend/colleague of the editor does not make someone an important artist. Being an art professor does not make someone an important artist. Nearly the entire printmaking faculty from one editor's alma mater is included! This is not a serious survey; it is a small step above coffee table book with an astonishingly pretentious title. There needs to be a serious survey of international contemporary printmaking, but sadly this isn't it."
2,HEAVILY SLANTED TOWARDS ABSTRACT WORKS,"A HARDCOVER BOOK FULL OF COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS, BUT WITH LITTLE APPEAL TO THOSE INTERESTED IN ANYTHING EXCEPT ABSTRACT PRINTS. UNLESS YOU ARE A COLLECTOR OF PRINTS THERE IS LITTLE OF INTEREST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AN ART COLLECTOR. TOO MANY ESOTERIC TERMS SUCH AS ""CHINE COLLE"", ETC.AND TOO LITTLE BACKROUND ON THE ARTIST OR THE TECHNIQUES INVOLVED IN THE STYLE OR SUBJECT. THIS US NOT A COCKTAIL TABLE BOOK, RATHER IT IS AN ART ASSOCIATION OR SCHOOL REFERENCE TYPE BOOK."
2,"inexpensive, and you get what you pay for in this case","Seems like a reasonable razor for the money, but as good shaver it leaves a bit to be desired. Even with the new blade, and foil I feel like I'm begging it to cut. The surface is very narrow, and rattles against your face. I'll give them credit for producing a razor at this price, but I should have spent a bit more and gotten something that does a better job."
3,"comfy and cute, but mediocre quality","I bought these shoes last season. They are comfy, a bit on the wide side. However, the outsoles are coming loose - detaching from the toe area. This is from very moderate wear, so it's disappointing."
5,Simply Fun!,"Natasha Chamberlain has a chip on her shoulder from a past trauma and is not above letting her anger rise to the surface to protect people or animals. Something that gets her into some zany situations and more and more trouble with her boss, sexy Jonce Striker. Striker questions his decision to hire Natasha as bodyguard to his good friend, reclusive millionaire Roger Valentine, but Roger is determined to keep Natasha on as his bodyguard.There are some great characters in this book (including Brutus, the Weimaraner), funny scenes, humorous dialogue, and sizzling chemistry between Striker and Natasha. I'd definitely call this a feel-good book and look forward to reading the others in the series.French joins the ranks of Karen Robards, Lori Foster, Linda Howard, and of course, the queen, Janet Evanovich in providing a funny, sassy read."
5,I'd give this book more than 5 stars if I could...,"I have been following this fabulous writer works since her first book (Chasing Horses), was published in 2001. Christy French has become a writer that continues to get better and better as a writer. Her books are exciting, interesting, and just plain fun. Do yourself a favor and read all of her books. You'll be very happy that you did! That's a fact!"
5,Love the writing-style of this writer!,"""The Bodyguard,"" is an exciting romantic drama that was so good I have read it twice already! I love the characters in this (the fourth novel) by Christine French. I think most people who enjoy this genre will nodoubt feel the same way! Fun Book!!!"
5,Action Packed,This book was full of action that will keep you on the edge. Christy Tillery French shows us some very well written imagination!!
5,I'm Still Laughing,"I really hope Ms. French turns this into a series. Natasha Chamberlain is the South's equivalent to Stephanie Plum or Kinsey Milhone. Natasha is wacky, impulsive, and gutsy. In her efforts to guard multimillionaire Roger Valentine, she tends to be overzealous and manages to keep getting into trouble, but her intent is good.Jonce Striker is a man used to giving orders and being obeyed. Along comes Natasha, who has a will of her own and intends to protect Roger, even if it means breaking a few rules and driving Striker crazy with her antics. Striker at first finds her amusing, then frustrating, and finally appealing. When the two connect, sparks fly. The Southern locale and dialogue are perfect.If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would. It's got it all: laugh-out-loud comedy, suspense, mystery, intrigue, and romance. I enjoyed it immensely."
2,Get her to a mental institution,"The story is nice and entertaining. Some of the dialogues are funny, and we like a girl with spunk. But this one just don't get it. To much of a good thing is sickening, and she is. I really don't get why the hero falls for her. He seems so nice. Beurk ! Don't bye this one, just get it at the library if you really like the author (not one of my favorite). After 60 pages you just can't stand her anymore."
4,Great read.,"It kept me wanting to keep reading, so that is great. I'll be buying some more from this author.Cheers."
5,Very helpful advice.,"If, like myself, you are naturally introvert it may still be difficult to apply the tecniques discussed for winning the date in the first place but the advice is completely flawless. Personally I ""won"" the dates by using an online dating agency which is one of the topics briefly discussed in the publication. If I hadn't read this book before hand I doubt I would have the same confidence in the dating situation and the dates may not have transpired to be as succesfull.Consequently this book has really worked for me, I am now dating women who I would previously of assumed would not look twice at me, though there is no magic formula to gain the confidence to attract women other than to question your assumptions and get yourself out there and do it by whatever means."
1,Not useful advice here.,"The problem about becoming friends before entering a relationship is it becomes very difficult to go from a friendship into a romantic relationship. I believe that this book is written by a man, that has been influenced by what he thinks women want. The fact is most women dont know what they want. This leads to the problem of trying to be something that may or may not be right. Women, like men want to be turned on by someone...they are not looking for friends, ideally during the process you become friends and lovers but the platonic/advice giving/exchanging type relationship goes nowhere 90% of the time. In fact, if you develop a good friendship first with a woman, she will not let it become intimate because of fear of ""ruining the friendship"" this is a well intentioned book, but not helpful in the real world."
1,What a Joke!,"I purchased this book with high hopes. I figured anything I could get out of it would be well worth it.For starters, this book provides very little new information for dating techniques/strategies. It is all common sense; that is any of it that's even of any use. He goes into so much detail about your personal appearance and hygiene, it practically undermines the whole purpose of the book. Mr. Wray also seems to put a lot of stock in being a 'friend' of a woman, that this will somehow improve your chances of starting a relationship with them. Anybody who thinks that having a 'friend thing' going with a woman and that it will somehow transform into a relationship is sadly mistaken. Sorry Mr. Wray, I'd rather try my luck at the bar anyday. (Something he repeatedly discourages.)While I haven't read many dating books, I can't say I recommend this one."
5,A woman's view on this book,"I was surprised at the number of reviews posted here by men. I was also surprised at how wrong they were. If men want to know what it takes to be successful dating quality women - it's all here. I gave copies of this book to my brother and two of his friends as well as the guy I'm currently seeing. We have had many long discussions about the topics in this book. While we don't always agree, I think he understands what I need for our relationship to continue to grow.If you are looking for easy sex, you already know where to go. No book is going to help you there. If you want to date someone worthwhile, I strongly recommend that you read this book and/or others like it. It's your choice. I know that I'm very happy now as things have really improved with my guy.By the way, I've also had many discussions with my girlfriends about the book. Again, not everyone agrees about everything, but we all agree that for the most part this book is right on the money."
5,Wonderful book! Great advice!,"This book really helped me clear my head. And gave me a whole new outlook to dating. I have totally change my perspective on dating. No more stessful times when it comes to trying to meet someone. I now enjoy going out to meet women. The cover was great, and format of the book was easy to go through. Nicely done!"
4,What You Want Is Now,"Good album, not as good as their Self Titled/Say No More album though. Still worth the purchase."
3,"Not bad, not good.","I'd heard ""Urban Station"" on the Jungle Flavours EP, and I was expecting this album to be along a similar vien.It was more like some of the other tracks on Jungle Flavours. Atmospheric experimental beats. It was interesting, but not too entertaining.The best part of this album, other than ""Urban Station"" is the cover art, you can't go wrong with enraged apes."
5,Great. Totally Hackable.,"You might be thinking, 'well I don't really tape anything or watch TV, so why would I need this thing, I mean, I never use my VCR anyway'. Well, prepare for a (dare I say) total paradigm shift 'cause this think will totally change your TV watching habits. I love how the thing learns the kind of shows you prefer to watch. I come home finding that Tivo has recorded a few surprises. There's always something in your liking to watch. Oh and the pause live tv feature is great as well. The one negative thing though is that you can't record a program and watch a different channel without going beyond the 'standard' setup (though that can easily be remedied with a splitter)... I can't imagine my TV without Tivo."
2,TiVo is heaven - don't buy Philips. Support is horrible.,"We adore our TiVo. The series 2 we got from Philips has worked fine - we upgraded the memory and love TiVo so much we're adding a second TiVo subscription to our household.We needed to get new cable boxes when our cable company went all digital. So now we want to use a serial cable to connect the remote from our TiVo to our cable box. Otherwise, you have to tape (really) a IR ""blaster"" to the cable box. Getting Philips to tell me what kind of serial cable cost me $19.99 for technical support and they didn't tell me how many pins there were etc. cGet the TiVo manufactured ones. They come with the cable -- that I can't find for sale in Chicago. I'll need to order online. It is not available on Philips' website of course....."
3,When it works,"I love the concept of the product. It's great when it works. Today, I'm sending it in because they say the hard drive needs to be replaced. I don't know if I will send it in. The exchange price is almost the cost of a new one. Funny how it waited one month after the warrenty was up. This one is really the fourth one that I've had. The first three didn't work out of the box. In order to get this one, I had a very patient Best Buy employee go through their stock until we found one that did work. In the end, there was only one left on the shelf."
2,"Tivo, great if it worked!",10/30/03My Philips TiVo 20 hour Tivo was working great for about four or five hours until the hard drive started acting up. Now the Hard drive seems to be messed up some how and all I can see now is a bunch of lines and blank screen. Now I have to go through the trouble of getting it fixed. This SUCKS because I just spent $150.00 for it and now the stupid thing won't work!
2,Great Idea - Defective Hardware,"I just got my HDR212 a few days ago, and I love would it says it can do. The only problem is, it crashes each time it starts recording. The problem is not addressed on either the Tivo or Philips website, and technical support is only open during regular business hours."
4,Learn WCF Hands-On!,"""Windows Communication Foundation: Hands-on!"" is a great book covering the framework and model of WCF.Each chapter starts with the basic concepts required to grasp the topic and then dives into a code example as a walkthrough.The topics are covered clearly and in depth. It completely changed my perception of what WCF really are.The book is well written with illustrative code examples and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn WCF."
4,Great book for learning WCF -- but examples are outdated,"This book was out well before the RTM of WCF and I'm amazed at how great a job the authors did being so far in the lead of the wave of WCF books. The entire book is really a set of explanatory articles walking readers through introductory topics, general knowledge, and deep dives into specific areas of WCF.The writing style is clear and to the point, and the exercises are great for demonstrating the specific bits they're talking about. The authors managed to keep all the code examples up to date via constant update releases on a companion website.There's also a bonus chapter covering InfoCard, its background, and how it ties in with WCF and some nice example code.(This is also one of the very few useful books I've found from Sams. I generally dislike their offerings, but this one's a winner.)"
2,Already Out of Date,Breaking changes in the June CTP make going through the samples frustrating and there are no updates on the publisher's site.These guys work for MS so they should have known about the breaking changes and delayed the book by 6 weeks so they could release it with updated content. If they are as deeply entrenched with the architects and developers as they say then they would know about changes long before they were implemented and released (i.e. they would know about June CTP changes in April).Now you have to drudge through the author's blog postings to find the updates. At the very least they could consolidate the updates into one zip file and put it on the publisher's site.Does it really make sense to release a book on May 25 only to have it out of date 4 weeks later?
1,Editorial murder,"I cannot fathom all the glowing reviews of No Mercy. First of all, the book crams 450 small-font pages into what should have been a 300-page book. Second, it took O'Hanlon over sixty pages just to begin his journey. My editor would have roasted me for that. Then he moves wrenchingly slow, presenting long conversations word for word, describing every single bird in minute detail, describing his boring, lecherous guides, telling of a poisonous snake (Wow!) that a companion killed. I'm not a beginner in true adventure. Give me Krakauer's Into Thin Air, or Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea, but deliver me from O'Hanlon's drivel. I finally had to stop reading about halfway through."
4,I want to go now,"This book gives anyone looking into searching for Mokele-mbembe proper discouragement before they can think twice about it. It was a fascinating study of sociology, history and nature. There was also a lot of useless irrelevant jabber about birds. It's amusing in that 'ha! British people are funny!' sort of way. It's worth reading, but only if you're committed to learning about the Congo, because this book is long and dreadfully boring in spots."
2,This is one weird book.,"Ok, I'll admit it.I enjoy arm chair travel books to places I would never,ever go to in real life. ""No Mercy""-- about Lake Tele in the Congo-- seemed to fit the bill. Wrong. It's not that its badly written but...well, its more along the line of J. Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" then it is a travel book. Its full of angst, and sturn und drag, and soul searching, the author against nature, the author against himself (he carefully chronicles his brushes with madness...I mean, toward the end he was THIS close to falling off his perch, if you know what I mean.) A mental health professional who also enjoys travel books would doubtless enjoy this ""Heart of Darkness"" type mode, but for the ordinary arm chair traveler-- like your's truly-- forget it!"
2,annoyance,"Like the previous reviewer stated, very difficult to get Inno in or out of the case. You can't use home/car dock while Inno is in the case. You have to remove it and that is a total pain in the ..."
1,Velcro Defective! Useless!,"Like other reviewers I, too, had a hard time getting the Inno into the rubber case, but I eventually managed, although I stretched out the rubber a bit putting it in the side opening. The problem I have is with the arm strap. The strap is made of a plasticy/rubbery/foamy material, with a sort of fuzzy-plastic surface. The velcro areas attached to this surface are sticky-velcro-- and the first time I put it on (just trying it on, rather than the hook and loop coming apart taking it off.... the fuzzy surface simply peeled off the armband.... leaving the velcro firmly attached to itself on the other side.This renders this product completely useless for running."
4,Good Trout,"I discovered Trout's fantastic grown-up music first, but as a perpetual child I must say that their kid's music is even better. ""Family Music Party"" blends both together beautifully with songs like the toddler tango ""Mine!"" and ""No Matter What Goes Right,"" one of my favorite love songs ever. If you like your music slightly southern fried (tangy, but not twangy) check these guys out."
1,Defective Product,"I purchased this to replace a printer drum that was almost depleted. When the printer said to replace the old drum, I inserted it, and it did now work. Pages printed were all-black, and the unit was leaking. I had to purchase another product -- this time a geniune product made by the printer's manufacturer."
5,"Appealing, compelling, sensitive, dynamic music and lyrics","What a treat when I picked this up just to ""check it out""! The cover art was intriguing--that sparked my initial purchase--and in my quest to study french language and culture, I figured I'd give it a try. With a variety of musical styles featured, beautiful lyrics, and Goldman's appealing voice, it's a very enjoyable CD on more than one level--whether you can understand the words or not! Studying the lyrics just makes it a fuller listening experience!"
5,what a great find: buy it now...,"I had previously heard the 'Fredericks, Goldman, Jones' album, and I found Carole Fredericks' husky voice and bad English accent a serious blot on an otherwise fairly good but not outstanding piece of work.En Passant was much more reassuring. It's good to see that Goldman's talent in song writing for other people (like Aicha and Le Jour Viendra for Cheb Khaled, and the album 'D'eux' and now ""S'il suffisait d'aimer"" for Celine Dion) has finally manifested itself in his own music.I loved this; Goldman does better on his own than writing for others; his songs for Celine (no doubt influenced by her greater popularity) display a lyrical banality that is absent from 'En Passant'. On the contrary: En Passant combines great music with sincere and often quite profound lyrics in a very appealing album. Buy it!"
4,Good work,"Honestly, I am not JJG's biggest fan. I own two of his CD's and am familiar with a couple of other songs from other discs. I do like this album for what it is, and I would recommend it, especially to those studying French, to get a taste of French music.My favorite song on this CD is ""Sache que je."" It is one of those songs that could last 10-15 minutes, and I wouldn't get bored with it. For me, this is a great CD for background music. When it ends, I don't want to put on anything else because I end up in a very calm mood and don't want it disturbed.I give it 4 stars because I think this is very good. Yes, JJG is an incredibly accomplished singer/composer, but he is just not completely my style. If he were, I would probably add that extra star."
1,One player only,"I was extremely disappointed in this game. First of all, if you are playing with more than one person, it takes way too much time. Bets are made one player at a time, so the people you are playing with have to wait until you are done in order to place their bets. That makes you feel rushed.The game also freezes up and stagers. It froze up on me twice the first hour I played.In all previous gambling games you could only play one player poker. I thought just possibly that your cards could be shown on your VMU, and then you could play poker with all four controlers. Not the case, only one player can play poker, slots, video poker.Graphics are nothing special, rather bad for DC. And If your going to have computer players that say things then at least have them say different things. About the 2nd time you hear the computer player next to you say the same thing they just said, you turn the computer players off.Slow, slow, slow. Don't buy"
3,"Good stickers, but....","Alright, these stickers are okay. Couple of things, 1. the adhesive should be on the other side, so they can be stuck to a window from the inside of one's house instead of sticking it to the outside of the window, which anyone can peel off, and 2. they're a bit too shiny and sparkly to look authentic."
4,Immediate results,"No septic tank pumping company suggested that monthly maintenance was necessary - or recommended this product for my septic tank. However, to see if odors seeping up from the toilet bowls would be eliminated, this septic tank treatment product was purchased - because it was the least expensive!This product seemed to work immediately... as there was no longer an odor seeping up from the toilet bowl. So would use it again!"
3,Septic tank,"11/26/12Hey, Ididn't have a chance 2 craw into the tank 2 check it out. W HEN i HAVE THE CHANCE i'lllet u know. Catch u later."
5,Beautiful and Engaging,"Appealing to the eye and soul, this book is a keepsake. The literary excerpts chosen are lovely, not trite. The images/artwork are peaceful. I enjoy just reading it for the warmth and love it conjures up. A wonderful gift too. Give it to your sister, your daughter, or yourself!"
5,Great book!,"We LOVE A Reson For Handwriting b/c the lessons are all mapped out for you, the lessons are short so the kids don't get bored and best of all it is a Christian book! Love it!"
4,Should i for Boys,I like this book for what it is and that you remember versus and learn the writing at the same time. What was hard was my 5 year old had a hard time with the length of each assignment. Boys are the slower developing side and was too much all at once. I had to shorten the assignment for him.
2,Not that helpful,"The Language activities are often book specific, and the activities are designed for younger children--through 8th grade."
1,not anything like photo,doesn't look anything like photo - balls are gray and can barely be seen. not at all worth the money - planning on returning.
1,"Law of Attraction, The Secret more insightful","This book was required reading for a workshop I was enrolled into. As someone who is an avid reader of The Secret, The Law of Attraction, Ask and It Is Given, Stephen Hawking, and quantum physics; I found this book boring and even offensive. Had I known Mr. Holmes would vomit scripture throughout this book, I would NEVER have purchased it! I lost respect for the author when he said The Bible is the most profound book ever written! He obviously has never studied the historical origins of the bible to make an ignorant statement. The material is bland and generalized. I've read much better books that give you examples, activities and creative ideas to manifest the life of your dreams. See above. This book is garbage."
3,Kind of a yawn,"Unlike many others who read this book, I found the presentation pretty boring. The thoughts are great but the book was, to me, dull."
2,This was good the first five seconds,"I use this cd player as often as I can ... but recently, I'm forced not to. It skips, actually it jumps from song one to song five playing 2 minutes and 3 seconds into the song. It always jumps, and I may not be moving the car at all. It plays regular cds somewhat ok, and mp3 cds are pretty much based on luck. It was good for the first five to ten minutes of its use with me. Now, it just screws up, gives me 'error' when I listen to cds, and jumps from song to song. I advise you to NOT buy this cd or from this brand, it's hard to trust them when they manufactor a cd player that doesn't do what the advertisements says it should."
3,Needs to be redesigned.,"I bought the Philips EXP103 Expanium Portable MP3-CD Player so I could listen to mp3s in my truck. And now that I have this product, I do. Overall, I don't regret buying it ... . However there are some problems: 1. It is TO light, it's construction is very cheaply made. 2. The LCD screen almost serves no purpose, in low light situations you can't even see it, and it doesn't display the name of a song. 3. It takes to long to start up, the first time I put in a mp3 filled CD, I thought something was wrong with my cd (or the player); after just leaving the CD in for a little while (probably around 45secs) it started playing. I have found no problem with the sound, it is plenty loud enough with the headphones, or with my factory sound system using the provided car kit. The headphones are a little cheap, but they work good enough."
5,Product satisfied my needs,"By now you know what this thing is capable of and what its drawbacks are. All I want to say is the volume and LCD screen were the 2 largest drawbacks for me. However, remember this is a 1st generation product. When I bought this, there were only 2 other MP3 CD players available. I must say this was by far the best buy then, and still is right now."
2,it worked fine for 1year..,now.. it plays first track and it wouldn't willing to play next song.(mp3 files) keep searching... and searching... have to stop and play it again.. and I get to listen to the first track over and over.. press FF? tried and I'm tired -_-;don't waste your money.. get a better one
5,Great Product and Great Value,It almost never skips. The screen is only hard to read sometimes. The price is great compared to other mp3 cd players and cd players. It has great sound.
2,overrated,"I bought the Philips EXP103 Expanium Portable MP3-CDPlayer not less than a year ago. I use it very often for my rides to school and whenever I'm going out. The mp3s burned onto a CDR when played on the CDPlayer takes a long time to examine the CD and finally playing it. Sometimes, it wouldnt even play a fine mp3 CDR.Anti-skip?. What a joke. I havent dropped it many times and yet it skips like a maniac. Just moving it slightly and trigger a skip in a regular audio CD and a mp3 CDR.This thing sucks lots of batteries. The mp3 component made it so cheap. I had to buy batteries everyweek just for playing a regular CD.Definitely an over rated product."
2,Highly Disappointed,"I had been looking forward to getting this product. Since I've received it I've gotten nothing but headaches. It skips on just about any CD I put in, including brand new ones. Sometimes it registers original (non copy) CD's as ""NF DISC"" which I assume means ""Not formatted."" Sometimes it says ""NO DISC"" which is even more frustrating. I sometimes have to try to press play over and over again until it is recognized. When reading an MP3 CD it takes quite a long time to read all the tracks. When playing from track to track, there is a slight delay between them, as opposed to having a nice flow from one to the other (terrible for mixed DJ CD's). And its bass boost isn't that powerful.I had a...normal Philips CD player before this one, and it performed much better.Don't waste your money. It's not worth it."
4,Philips EXP103 Great MP3 Player Great Price,"In order to make this unit play MP3 you must have a great MP3 utility. I use Easy Creator 4.0 and do not max out the CDR. I use it in my car and have not had any problems. I also use the player at my work and plug in my Harman/Kardon speakers that came with the Dell Computer at my work. It takes a while to get to a specific track, and it does not display the artist. But for the price, I highly recommend this unit! The unit from Amazon comes with a car kit and a set of earphone speakers. The car kit is great and works well in my Alero. I don't use the earphone, they hurt my ears! Anyway if you burn your MP3 correctly this unit works well!"
2,EXP103,"I also purchased this player and promptly returned it. It was packaged nicely with a nice box, but little else appealed to me once I got the thing going.First, the player failed to play many CD-R's that would play fine on my computer. I checked to see if this might just be a problem with my writer/reader combination, however using other CD players confirmed that my EXP103 was the problem.The sound is poor. When the player did play CD's it did so with a lot of background noise with a relatively ""flat"" sound quality. This even occured with original audio CDs.I returned this thing and took a stab at a Rio Volt and haven't looked back. The Volt is the best damn thing I've bought since I purchased my first Sony Walkman back in 1982. Maybe Sony will do even a better job..."
3,"Brand new technology, what to expect.",Well as mentioned befor you cannot scan in mp3 mode. Which furthers my frustration is when I burn a cd and the mp3 player Plays the mp3s OUT of the order I placed them in befor i burnt the mp3-cd. This is brand new technology and it is bound to improve......... If you can afford to drop the bucket in this item go ahead...If not wait for the refinded technology!
2,"nice as my first mp3-cd player, but there's better ones","when i first got my expanium, life was good. when it first came out, it was the best mp3-cd player of its time. the only things i didnt like is no ID3 tag support, lack of searching a song, and the long start-up time. the more directories i had, the longer it would take to start, up to 45 seconds.now i have a Rio Volt, which starts in 15 seconds, had a backlit display... its the best CD player i've ever had, and the best mp3-cd player."
4,A Great One,"This one is a great MP3 player: you just burn a CD with MP3 music, then you put it on your Expanium, hit play and its done. You can record tons of music (like 150 songs) in a cd, you can also put them in separated folders and it'll work too. You'll just need one or two cds to store all your music.The only bad thing is that the song name, author, etc. can't be displayed on the lcd screen, but its great."
5,The best CD-MP3 player out there for Xmas 2000!,"Interesting that I just read about a few of it's shortcomings! I love this baby! I didn't know it ignored long filenames songs! Anyways, if you are CONCIDERING getting this - get it! I DO miss the ID tags , but what the heck, songs are about LISTENING right? :) Very solid unit. Built great. Volume is a bit low with headphones. Played all my CDRs and CDRWs! no skipping, etc...perfect! jim@cheseborough.com"
3,Phillips EXP 103 MP3 CD Decent At Best,"The unit plays well. My complaints are that the one line display is very hard to read, even when holding it close. Next is the resume mode does resume where it left off when last played for regular CD's but has no idea where to start when playing MP3's. My biggest complaint is that it does not display the MP3 album title, just AL01, AL02, etc. nor does it display the MP3 song titles, just 1, 2, etc."
1,So what do I do with this thing?,"OK, I've had this thing since Christmas and all it is is a portable CD player from a company that can't support it. Like a reviewer I saw earlier, I get the DATA message when I try to use CD-RW. All I could get from Philips customer support is to make sure I use audio-only CDs, which I am, but still no luck. The single biggest appeal to me was the ability to use CD-RWs, but I have been unable to make it work so far and they can't help.If this will do what it claims, it will be awesome, but if you buy it you better be well-versed in how to create the MP3 CDs. I have made lots of CDs from MP3 via wav files, but still can't figure out how to do this with just MP3s. And good luck if you have to go through Philips customer support! I've been trying for days and they can't give me any answers."
2,Not but so pleased,"I've bought this mp3 player,and it has nice quality sound on regular music CD albums, but it seems it will not work for me on mp3s, I am using CD-RWs, but for some odd reason when i put the CD in, it with flash 'disc' ofcourse, but then turn ino 'Data' and will never play. I'm pretty sure the sub directories and names of the mp3s are correct, and have read the instruction booklet throughly. If anyone has any help with this, please contact me at magick_karma_@hotmail.com its very much appreciated. Thanks and happy shopping! :)"
3,"Don't buy this product, wait until next release","This is a very nice looking product, but it comes up short on a number of key areas in MP3 mode. 1. It is not possible to search throughout a song. For example, let's say we are listening to an MP3 track and we want to rewind it a bit. Not possible. It's 2000 for pete's sake. 2. Holding the fast forward button down causes the unit to advance to the next album. 3. No MP3 label information display.Philips can do better. Especially with the sticker price, they should be ashamed. I would have kept it had it allowed me to fast forward and rewind while playing mp3 tracks; the mp3 label info display wasn't all that important to me. I just bought a similar device that allows me to fast forward and rewind. It also displays MP3 artist/track info, the only problem is that it is a major pain to move to different albums. oh well, it too shall be returned..."
1,Too little for price,"Avoid this. There are better MP3 players on the market with more features at the same prices. Very surprising display is so limited - with 150 songs on a CD it would seem like a basic requirement to show the songs title and length (as most newer ones do).Frankly, I think this is an overstocked item that YOU are paying to clear out."
3,Good but got some bugs,"I buy this mp3 player in december last year, but 5 months later i discover some bugs (i primaly use it in the car stereo), it takes too much time to start playing mp3's, the resume feature don't works all the time, it skips some files in playing, from time to time an error ocurs and it reset the play to the first song of the first album, in the car is kind of dificult to operate it, if you want a mp3 for the car i recomend you one with remote control, besides the ESP works fine even in rocky roads"
5,Great MP3/CD Player,"After reading most of the reviews on this web site for this MP3/CD player, we bought one for my husband and he loves it. I ended up liking it so much that I just bought one for myself to have in my car. Yes, the display is dark and a little hard to read, but since I know what's on my CDs I really don't need to see a display. As far as sound goes, regular audio cds or audio cds burned to the same audio cd format sounds great. Some MP3s don't sound as good, but I expected that and it's not because of the player (they don't sound any better on anything else either). It rarely skips in the car. In fact, it didn't skip when I would have expected it due to bad roads. It seems to handle folders fine. Sure, you don't get the name of the folder (they're numbered), just be sure to print a list of your folders and songs to keep track. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have the flexibility to play both MP3s and audio cds."
3,Philips EXP103 eXpanium,I was very impressed when I bought this player a year ago but it gradually broke down to the point where it no longer reads any type of multimedia.
3,"Works ok, with some quirks","As always, I will concentrate on the cons of this item:I use in a car, and I found that after I turn on the car, I have to go through this sequence to put it in the right mode:(1) press play button(2) wait 30 seconds or so for it to scan the CD(3) press the mode button to select shuffle modeIt has a resume feature where it remembers the last song when it was turned off. Unfortunately it does not remember the shuffle mode. Very annoying.Also, there is no light on the LCD display. But I guess it's ok because there isn't much to see on the 7-segment digit display anyway (looks like calculator display)BTW, my unit came with a defective car cassette adapter. Only the right channel has sound. I hope there is a repair center near me because I don't want to return the whole thing.I have no other complain. Overall I still prefer it over my cassette player."
2,Sorry but not a great choice,Ok. Pros and Cons1. ... covering- I dropped it one time and it stoped reading Mp3 Based Cds2. ...!3. Need a Burner on ur computer BEWARE YOU CANT USE THIS THING IF YOU DONT HAVE A BURNER!4. No little..(charectors)..in your Song titles. Doesnt Read the file if you have these!5. Scrolls through REALLY slow takes a long time to get to High Numbers in your play list6. Horrible SOund HORRIBLE DONT BELIEVE THE OTHERS. I take this on my bus and i cant hear the darn thing.7. Sound Quality is ok.8. Need Quality cds9. Of course the Ear phones are horrible and hurt my ears. 10. Want Something good?? Intel Pocket Concert is the bomb mp3 Player. Overall dont get it not worth your precious money
3,try try again,"The best is yet to come in this arena, from any brand, but for now the best (and the best buy) is the MPTrip. Definitely check it out before buying this if performance (rather than brand name and appearance) is your concern."
3,duhhhhhh?,"i just recevied the EXP 103 as a christmas gift. i don't know what i am doing. is it able to play MP3s without burning them onto a CD, cause that takes a while? i don't understand the technical jargin they use to decribe the stuff about the MP3s. all i know is that if it can't download songs from off of the internet, they i will return it. i already have a CD player, i don't need another."
2,MP3 not as great as it sounds,"I bought the expanium expecting ""magical"" skip protection, which did suffice while driving, but not for walking or working out at the gym. as far as the mp3 cd's half of the time I end up hitting play three or four times as it tells me there is ""no disc"" quite frustrating. looking to return it and get a higher end player."
2,Disappointment,"I purchased the Expanium with the hopes that it would perform as well as my friend said it did. Unfortunately, that was not the case. My first problems were with getting it to play MP3s on a CR-RW. It kept reading the disc as ""data"", even after I contacted Philips to ensure I was completely the transfer of MP3s correctly. After several attempts, on both CD-R and CD-RW, I gave up and decided I would try an audio cd. Even with the ESP on, it skipped frequently, just walking with it, which my Sony CD player never does. I found the fastforward button did not work well at all. The volume was also very low, even at it's highest setting. Finally I just returned it, displeased with Philips customer service attempts."
1,Not good at all,"Bought one last year and was able to use for only 2 weeks. Now it plays (both ordinary cd audio and mp3's) sometimes but most of the time it will not recognize the cd at all. The player did not undergo any rough handling or anything. If all the reviews about how good this product is true, then I guess I'm just unlucky."
