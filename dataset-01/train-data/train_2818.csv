5,Klezmer Nutcracker,"Makes one want to dance and sing , call friends over to dance and sing. I hignly recommend it Mazoltov"
5,Perfect size,"I purchased this Bible a year ago and I take with me everywhere I go. It is small enough that it fits in my back pocket, yet the font is large enough and clear enough to read easily. Also, having it readily avaiable allows me to share passages with others when the opportunity arises. I prefer the NASB version over other versions because it's very closely translated from the origional languages making word studies easier. I have been very pleased with it's durability. It has a nice sturdy zipper case that handles everyday use well. I would recommend this Bible to anyone who is looking for a pocket size complete Bible."
2,Hardly the Best Giallo,"This 1971 offering stars Giancarlo Giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison-dipped needle before eviscerating them.The production is above average slick and the performances are fine, especially from Giannini, but I just didn't find it involving, suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward. It's not bad, just average. The climax and the killer's unmasking is particularly weak and anti-climactic.Fans of the genre seem to really like this one, but I suggest a rental before a purchase."
1,advertisiment shows it brighter than it is.,I was very disappointed to see it advertised as a 90.00 unit on sale for 30.00 sounded like a great deal. When I looked at the ad it looked as though the light covereda nice area of water. Yet when I used it my light covered very little about 2 feet in diameter. Very disappointed....
1,Coleman doesn't warranty this product!!!!,"In my opinion, this is not a well made product. It is not guaranteed by Coleman even though it carries the Coleman brand. Mine broke during it's initial use and when I wrote to Coleman, they told me to contact the company in Canada that makes the product. They replied that they would not replace the unit."
1,Very poor quality,"Used too keep a battery charged on an outdoor stored ATV, just like the picture on the packaging, after the winter months it stops working. I try to troubleshoot the item and the screws holding the body together have plastic caps over them. Upon trying to pry out the glass breaks on the solar panel. My suggestion for Coleman if making an inferior product make it easier to repair. Do not buy if plan on using outside."
3,Coleman Solar Charger 300 mA,"I'm not sure item works. It could be too small for what I am using it for. I'm trying to use it as a trickle charger to maintain a battery in our camping trailer while it sits idle over the winter. It may be too small for this job. The less than one year old battery is not maintaining its strength with nothing running.It is currently not connected directly to the battery but through a cigarette lighter type outlet inside the camper. Charger sits in the window of the camper facing south all day. I may try direct connecting it to the battery and placing charger outside camper (in the weather) to see if that makes a difference. If it doesn't, I guess it was a waste of money.ps: The only thing running off the battery is the smoke/CO2 detector."
2,Where are the specs?,"Solar panels always have a set of specs such as Open circuit voltage, Short circuit current, and an operating current at a particular operating voltage while being illuminated with a standard luminous flux.Nothing like that is given and in fact I can only get a maximum of 3.8 watts out of this panel at high noon during the summer. The comments on here questioning the weather resistance is worrisome. Amazon should pull this product."
4,Sunshade for my 2007 X3,Its the type you roll out fits tightly around the windshield I don't even need to use the sun visors and when you roll it up it has a velcro strap. Not bad it does the job and keeps it cooler.
3,This could have been better,"I was a little disappointed to find that this set, as good as it is, does not have some of my favorite SNL musical performances. I was hoping that it would at least have ABBA from the first season, but it does not, nor does it have the B-52s from 1979, Stevie Nicks from 1983, or Mick Jagger from 1992. But on the up side, it does have Simon & Garfunkel and Tom Petty. I wouldn't discourage anyone from investing in this set, but I would just advise that you take a good look at the performance list before buying."
2,WHERE IS STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN???,"my title says it all...well, mostly. so many others were omitted - why?? ridiculous! and why the pointless sketches?? some were pointless to begin with, but on this dvd, they are completely unnecessary."
4,Awesome Collection,"This is an awesome collection of some of the best moments from Saturday Night Live, especially the early (pre-Spice Girls) days. Great performances by Patty Smith, Paul Simon, Beck, REM, the list goes on and on. I deducted a star for some of the music-related skits that were totally un-funny. The early ones were good (Bill Murray's cheesy lounge lizard act - priceless!) but declined in quality as the show got older - which is reflected by the rest of SNL as a whole."
3,Saturday Night Live - 25 Years of Music,Unfortunately the person I bought the DVD for was VERY unhappy because the seller advertised that BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN was in it...and he was NOT. That was the sole reason for purchasing the DVD set.
3,No Leon Redbone?,Unless i missed it there's no Leon Redbone on this set. To my knowledge there's no Leon on dvd?? Please give us some Redbone.
2,If it was all music they would have had my money by now.,"Wouldn't it be great to have five DVDs packed full of music segments from SNL? Or, how about just one DVD for each season, with all the music performances?I'm sure glad I read reviews. If I had just bought this based on the title I would have been very dissapointed.If it was just music, I could put the DVD in my system at home or work and just crank the music! Or, I could watch it too if I wanted to. But what's the point of calling it ""25 Years of Music"" and have it be a lot of other stuff?"
1,Only Half Music and Al Franken?,"I would have rated this 3 stars because it was only half music. The rest was skits and some of them great but the point being that it is advertised as ""Music."" This is deceptive. When I got to DVD 3 the rating dropped to 1 star - wanted to give it 0 but can't. Al Franken's opening is absolutely discusting when he tries to make funny in some bizarre way, only Al can explain, the deaths of John Belushi, Gilda Radner, and Chris Farley. Where were the editors, producers, etc...Are thes people still snorting coke? Nope, their snorting a new more dangerous drug - Narcissus"
1,Garbage,"Just a few questions:What about The Specials?What about the B-52's?How about FEAR? (Halloween show, yes you remember...)And where's Pearl Jam?Think of all the truly groundbreaking musical performances that were on SNL, you know, the one's you saw when you were a kid and said ""What the...?"" but then you grew to understand that what you had seen was the real deal, forever opening your eyes to REAL music.Don't waste your money on this pile of stank."
2,25 years of music and smug comedians,"They had Paul Simon, and Carly Simon, but that wasn't close to their normal ratio, so the producers decided to add a good dose of their attention-starved, hard-on-the-eyes comics and writers (Al Franken) talking as smugly as they can about themselves, and the acts. Then they throw in some those ""for the ages"" Saturday Night Live skits with their marvelous use of loud and distorted speech filling in for comedy. As has been said, the difference between a SNL sketch and life, is that life ends. And who could ever get enough of Lorne Michaels smarmy self-promotion!! How about releasing another 5 DVDs just filled with music..."
2,Where is DEVO????,"Please tell me that there are more discs coming... And fyi, the Mick Jagger - Tom Snyder (Dan Aykroyd) bit was boring back when I saw it the FIRST time (in the 70s)."
3,Gives Debunkers a Bad Name,"Why does Gardner think of himself as a debunker of pseudoscience if he never debunks anything? He takes the attitude that it is beneath him to actually explain why these ufologists, New Age therapists, et al, are nuts. Consequently: (1) The layman will learn very little practical science (other than an interesting chapter about dreams); and (2) this book will appeal only to those who are already inclined to agree with him--and maybe not even them, as I found him to be self-righteous and not terribly instructive.Compare Gardner's work to the infinitely superior work of Carl Sagan, esp. The Demon-Haunted World. Sagan fights stupidity with FACTS and SCIENCE, not simply labeling people as kooky. (We KNOW they're kooky already--explain WHY!) I give this book 3 stars because I don't want to suggest it's bad, as much as it is a missed opportunity."
4,once the best Gardner's book.,"Martin Gardner surprises us again with his new work about scientific fraud. Together with Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan, Gardner shows us the real way of science. This book is a rich in surprising information an clear writing."
1,Save your money and your time,"If you are looking for anything having to do with common sense, ""tried and true"" unbiased scientific thought and method, helpful material, undisputable evidence in favor of evolution, you will not find it within the pages of this book. While the material is clich√©, it still does not warrant the cost of the book, for any purpose other than something to prop a door open.A good rule of thumb, if there are several authors on the back cover of the book that are known room temperature IQ types that are singing its praises, it isn't worth the trouble of reading it."
5,"My favorite album of all times,","My favorite album of all times. All the songs are meaningful and touch you in different ways - it's like a diary which unfolds through listening to it. Excellent songs Para Ti, No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti, Guarda el Vacio and above all that I love!!."
5,One of her Best..Totally Agata!!!!!,"This musical production is filled with energy and offers a wide array of musical rhythms and levels of energy. Featuring a typical characteristic of Agata productions, this CD offers a little bit of everything. All songs in this CD are rated 5/5 and contains tunes still popular on the radio airwaves today.If you've only heard the singles on the radio, you are definitely missing out on the entire CD. This is a must-have for any collector of vibrant latin pop music and contains many tunes that, if possible, should have been selected as singles."
4,"Handy, functional device","In teaching myself guitar, I found myself learning the notes and melody but not necessarily being a devotee to keeping accurate time. To realistically gauge my progress, I decided to buy this metronome. It comes highly recommended on various guitar sites like Musician's Friend, Zzound, etc. and having used it, I think the reviews are accurate. You can configure the rhythm, beat AND tempo and with it's compact size, it's more functional than comparable models. The only negative I have is the ""beep"" tone - as a former violin player, I'm used to the old school ""click"" sound of traditional wooden metronomes. But then again, I can't clip one of the old wooden metronomes to my music stand, now can I? ;-)Highly recommend."
2,Longevity not an atribute,"I bought the ""Boss"" about a year ago. It arrived quickly and I originally liked it. After only 3 months the thing reset to its default of 120 bpm. No worries, I replaced the batteries and it worked for about another 3 months. Replaced the batteries and the thing refuses to work. All my paperwork is tossed so here I sit with a no good piece of junk, unable to return it. Buyer beware on this one."
1,Glitchy!,"I have used this metronome for about 2 months. I practice about 2- 3 hours per day, most of this time with a metronome. After about 3 weeks of use, the unit would work well for about 60 minutes then quit and reset it itself to 120 bpm. Once this happened, it would work correctly for only a minute or two then stop and reset back to 120 bpm again. It needed to sit idle for at least an hour before it would work correctly. The replacement given me by the retailer developed this problem after only a week."
3,this metronome has problems,i like the way this metronome is thought out but think that in the end it is too endlessly complicated. there are also problems with it that i cannot seem to understand. when i am using it at a tempo and attempt to change the tempo it will suddenly half the metronome marking and stay there with budging no matter what i do to it. i will have to return it and get another brand as this is a malfunction i am sure.
2,Inadequate,"There's no volume adjustment, and no way to adjust the click tone, which is a high-pitched electronic bleep. The bleep has a definite pitch to it, which is a problem if you are playing in a different key than the metronome is bleeping in."
2,Doesn't do what I needed.,"This product was fine at first. Sure, it gives you simple beats and if you have a good ear you can tune your instrument, but it doesn't have a digital tuner, and the subdivision options aren't the greatest. Also, it is confusing to use. I do not recommend this product unless you are a very young musician, or have a good ear."
2,Not LOUD enough,"I am a piano instructor and one of my students has this metronome. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. My students have a difficult time hearing it when they are practicing and feel as though those students struggle more with steady tempo than my other students who use Wittner MT70 Unfortunately in less than a month, the MT70 has increased in price by $20 and has become increasingly difficult to find online at a reasonable price, Amazon or otherwise.The ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does have beat subdivision (i.e. eighth notes, triplets, etc) which is extremely helpful for my students, which the Wittner MT70 also has.If you can find it, Wittner MT70 is the way to go, I've been using now for 5 years and is the metronome we buy exclusively for our students."
3,"Works fine, but hard for kids to work on their own.","I bought Roland Dr. Beat Metronome after reading reviews on Amazon. My sons needed one for their piano practice at home. I figured out how to use it without the instructions, but my sons have brought it to me a number of times when they have gotten it into the wrong beat sequence, so they have struggled more with figuring out the options. They are 8 and 10. I am hoping after a little more time with it and a little more help they will be able to use it fully without any help."
1,"Frustrating, Eats Batteries and Glitches",My brother and I have two of these dr beats which eat batteries at an obscene rate and have a ridiculous glitchy problem of reseting whenever it feels like it.I've spent over a hundred dollars over the two metronomes so far and now i do not even have a single one of them working properly.Boss ought to do a recall...
3,Emitted pitch is annoying,"The metronome features are alright (via the RHYTHM/BEAT button), but the tone that it emits (via the NOTE/PITCH button) is annoying.I like to use a device like this to play a constant pitch that I then tune my instrument to. The tone that this device emits has some strange overtones, so it's hard for my ear to tell if my instrument is truly sharp or flat in relation to that tone.I'm going back to the Korg MA-30. I remember it having a much purer sound."
4,The best Di Luna on CDs!,"Ettore Bastianini in one of his show roles is absolutely marvellous! Just listen to his 2nd act aria or 1st act trio... Cossotto makes listeners thrilling, particulary in the final scene. Bergonzi is very ellegant and never shouts. Good, although it isn't his best recording. Stella - acceptable and not mannered fortunately as many other sopranos. Serafin's conducting is as usual, I mean heart moving. Just for music lovers!!!"
2,Took a dive just after warranty,The graphic card was great while it was working. 1 yr. and 6 mo. of owning in a lightly used desktop and the card went kapoot.
4,A very good novel based on the author's experiences.,"For those that don't know of CAPT Dale Dye, USMc (Ret), he is the technical advisor who adds all the realism, grit, and detail to films including ""Platoon"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". In addition to adding the realistic details and elements to these films, things that he has experianced in his own life, Dye also acts in a many films. You may recognize him as one of the guys who REALLY shot Kennedy in ""JFK"" or as the company commander in ""Platoon"", or one of his numerous other roles as a military man.The novel itself flows very well, a fluidity which seems to reflect the thoughts of the author and protagonist very directly. This novel is also very autobiographical, as far as I can tell based on some details of the author's life. I recomend this novel based both on it's style and substance."
5,Excellent,"This whole transaction went very well. I love the product, and it got to me in a very short time. Thank you."
4,Good punk compilation,"As much as I would like to give this cd 5 stars, I just can't do it. Even though it is probably my favorite cd right now there is one glaring prob. That is the first 8 songs rip and it drops off for awhile after that. There is some good Rancid, Ten Foot Pole and Pennywise mixed in after that but a lot of the other stuff isn't as good as the beginning stuff. If the tracks would have been better dispersed this would be a fiver. Still an insane cd!"
5,awesome punk comp,"This is a kick a$$ punk compilation with such bands as NoFX,Pennywise,H2O,Bad Religion,I Against I, and many more. I recommend this punk compilation over any other.It is well worth it for only four bucks. A great c.d. for tru punx."
3,Retelling of a retelling,"This is a novelization of the Hal Willis movie based on the stage play by Maxwell Andersen. So there you are. It's pretty good for a novelization. It has a bit more in it than the film does--the few conversations that 1969 censors snipped out are here for your mild titilation. Odd that such a long movie (146 minutes) should be such a short novelization (barely 160 pages). It's not terribly accurate, either in history or characterization, but that's hardly Fenton's fault."
3,"""Close but no cigar""","A Good Idea but its lacking: ADAD was on the right track BUT I had 6 problems with it. 1) Too much food at every meal! Like alot of the meals have double side dishes fish with peas and potatoes is fine, but you dont need the cole slaw. 2) Too much fruit in the entrees, They must love apples and oranges! One or two recipes, fine but not 7 outta 10! 3) Desserts, Im fine with maybe a muffin or yogurt. Not food colored, artificially flavoured coolwhip for dessert! Not wholesome at all! 4) Weird recipes like ""Pistachio Parfait"" that has NO Pistachioes! 5) Their Nifty Weekly shopping lists! Fine, but Im not gonna buy 10 sizes of apples or onions or why couldnt it have just said a quart of milk instead of 2 cups and 1/4 cup whole milk? 6) Extra unnecessary work Why Re-Refried beans or Fiesta fruit salad? It would have been heathier easier and cheaper to purchase premade fruit salad and warm the can of beans?"
1,"Great concept, flawed execution","I was delighted with the idea of having someone else plan my dinners, and the first menu I tried was nice enough. However, subsequent menus had several problems, ranging from nutritional imbalance to major and minor ingredient/instruction omissions. For example, one menu used soy sauce liberally in three of the four dishes (none in the dessert!)giving a distressing sameness of color and flavor and a high sodium count to the evening meal; another menu omitted leavening from a cake recipe, and another called for celery to be chopped, but never specified what to do with it. I gave up on this cookbook, and would have returned it if I hadn't splashed soy sauce on one of the pages."
4,good book,"I find that the general concepts presented in this book are still valid, even several years after its publication. Most of the commercial graphics software out there follows similar programming architectures and this book covers these fairly well.However, you need to read the Open Inventor Toolmaker book to extend your Open Inventor Library distribution by adding more nodes/actions/engines, it also gives a much more in depth understanding. The real power of this library is that you can extend it fairly easily.For the reference manual book for detailed specs about functions or callback methods, they are all available in the online manual pages now which are distributed freely by SGI since August of 2000."
3,Not much on Retail... and pricey for what you get.,"A bit dissapointed that there was very little targeted toward Retail, specifically lacking in the areas of shopping center and out parcel development... but the formulas were interesting, and the concepts that were explained... were done so in great detail."
5,Very Good!,"Very satisfied. The book is perfect as I thought. And it arrives on time. I have not read the book yet, but I am very happy with this deal."
2,no POE,"i bought this item to install some IP cameras, this switch worked good but the POE didnt work, when i did some research i found out this switch will work with cisco ip phones only.recommended for IP cisco phones installers only."
2,Nice,"Needed for daughters dance class, did what it was, however wasn't has thick as others, so tore fairly early....I wouldn't buy again"
1,Xxl it is not,These tights were supposed to be an xxl but when i got them they wouldnt even fit my size 8 sister. Absolutely horrible. Complete waste of money. So unless youre a size zero these wont fit
2,Runs small,"If you're a size small, get them. But they do not work for mediums also. Wish there was a regular Medium size"
1,The sizing chart is incorrect!,"I'm size 6, so according to sizing chart I should order S/M. However, on the product packaging, with height/weight, I am a Large/XLarge! These would not fit - they are too short."
2,Snag easy,"These tights are not holding up well. We still have competition tights from 3 years ago, that no longer fit my daughter and they are still in good shape - some minor snags. These are full of snags after only 2 competitions. I will be urging the coach to pick a different brand next year."
2,"Way, way to small.","These tights were of great quality, but way to small! If you aren't very short, don't buy these tights, sorry."
3,"I like it but,","I actually bought one pair in the Capezio star and according to the size chart I would be a size small. I am 5ft and 98 pounds. I am very petite and thin but the spandex waist is really tight. It squeezes my waist so much it looks like I am fat and it is not very comfortable to breathe. Anyway, I ordered a large and the waist lets me breathe better.."
3,First Wear Run,"I bought these for my 12 year old granddaughter, and with the first wear she already got a run on the back of one leg. I am really looking for thicker tights or leggings that will hold up with an active child."
5,Good tights,"These are great tights. They look nice and they hold up through several washings. As always, high quality from Capezio."
2,gross.,"Usually, I love the Capezio tights I order from Amazon. The ""nude"" shade is very gray and makes me look sick. It was a waste of money unless I plan to dress up as a zombie anytime in the future. And I dont."
3,"Always buy Capezio, unfortunately they have a hole already.","I bought these for my daughter the ballerina. We always bu Capezio products. Unfortunately on the day of her performance, she got a small hole in them and couldn't wear them and now they are relegated to class only level. They were a bit high priced, however with free shipping it was the best deal I could find."
3,Sizing Runs Small,"These are great quality tights, unfortunately the sizing runs small from what is listed on Amazon. I'm usually a size six, but just barely am a Large/XL based on the sizing chart on the package, which seems to be about right (they are just a little too small, no matter how I try to stretch them)."
4,Just What I Needed!,"I participate in competitive speech in my school. Our uniform consists of a suit and either black or nude tights/pantyhose. Tired of buying pantyhose that would always stretch and become useless after one use, I decided to give tights a try. This ""natural"" shade is just what I wanted! It just matches my skin tone (I'm light-skinned) without being nearly white. The tights are smooth to the eye and the touch. The hole at the foot is odd, but they ARE ballet tights. So far I haven't detected any stretching and am very satisfied with my purchase. They are a suitable alternative to pantyhose for me and well worth the price!"
4,great product,It was small for my size. But Quality of the product was great. Gave it to my little sister. She liked it.
5,Definitely buy at least a size up!,"Thanks to advice from previous reviewers, I bought a much larger size than I would have otherwise. My 5-0, 85 lb dancer daughter wouldn't usually even wear women's sizes. But she is wearing Women's L/XL of these tights - and they fit beautifully. She loves them - they are very comfortable. I don't know how much they'll stretch as she grows - but they are perfect right now. So glad I read the reviews!"
5,"""Ballerina necessary""",Amazon is the seller of this marvelous necessary item for any ballerina. The size was right and the color was perfect.
1,Most uncomfortable tights ever,"I am an adult, and I purchased these tights at my local dance apparel shop. I am 5'4 and I weigh 120lbs. I purchased the Lg/XL size because I like to be comfortable, and to be safe. When I tried them on they were so tight I thought I was going to be ill. I went to class without tights because I have never been so uncomfortable in a garment in my life.Please do not buy these tights...I honestly don't believe that even the largest size will fit me.Two days ago I decided to order the DASKIN Ultrasoft Convertible ballet pink tights. I purchased the C/D size to be safe, and they are comfortable. I just tried them on and they are a great fit.Danskin Women's Convertible Tight"
2,Disappointed.,"Initially found them to be very soft, comfortable. Within 2 dance classes a hole broke through at hip area. Unusual spot for a snag. Disappointed."
2,Ripped,"Ripped after only three uses. Possibly because I have long nails, but for the price I wish they were sturdier."
3,works fine for what it is,"This works fine for what it is, all the advertised capabilities are there. I do resent buying a product with locked capabilities (OBD-II for specific makes) that can add up costing hundreds of dollars more if you want to use them. Maybe that's just the way of things, but I'll look hard at this and other scanner manufacturers before buying again.So, one star off for charging extra for unlock codes to use something that's already built in, and another star off for continuing to charge full price for these ""upgrades"" years after the unit was produced. When you buy the unlock codes, you are allowing a company to literally print money for themselves."
1,"Why is this listed as Steve Fromholz on Google, etc.","Twice, I ordered ""Steve Fromholz: Live at Anderson Fair"" on CD, once from another vendor, and once from Amazon. Both times, I received ""timelines"" by Darrel Tidaback. Steve Fromholz is not featured on the CD anywhere. The first vendor refunded my money and told me to keep the CD I received. Amazon sent me a return label and refunded my money. Tonight, I Googled Steve Fromholz again and was directed to Amazon once more. This time, Amazon got the right title (timelines)on their page, but the price has gone from $17 to $99. I don't know how this CD has been confused with Steve Fromholz, but I am not impressed. As information, I wouldn't buy this CD for $17, and I sure wouldn't buy it for $99."
2,I kept expecting something to happen and it didn't,"After reading this book I feel I know more about the workings of a radio station that I needed to know. I could see the plot, and kind of know where the author is going, but she just did not quite get there. There was this build up and I kept expecting something exciting to happen and it didn't."
3,A Tribute To Genesis - 'The Fox Lies Down' various artists,"As for tribute albums go,this one is so-so.Some of the decent tracks include Daevid Allen&Solid Sound Space's take on ""Visions Of Angels"",the dream-like Flower Kings covering ""Cinema Show"" and Darxtar's remake of ""Dancing With The Moonlit Knight"".There are,however two truly outstanding cuts,Mother Gong's version of ""In The Beginning"" and Architectural Metaphor delivering their powerful brilliance to the progressive gem ""The Waiting Room"".Check out some of the other tribute CD's that've been released by the Cleopatra label,like the King Crimson and Neu! ones."
1,One good track,"Sorry to say this CD mostly sounds like an high school jazz/rock ensemble's rehearsal. ""Cinema Show"" is where it comes together, but it too is flawed because the ending on even this one good track seems to have been chopped-off(sort of like a radio station that miscalculates available air time and fades out the ending of a song to get the mandatory station ID in).Save your money; or buy it only if this ever turns up in a bargain bin."
4,I'm really with my new acquisition.,A nice collection for those who would like to have more from Tolkien's world.You may find it's between The History of Middle Earth volumes and the collection by Editorial HarperCollins.Really affordable and enjoyable.I recommend it for any person who wishes to have a fantasy time in bed right before going to sleep.
5,Great to have a Box Set,I love reading Tolkien books and it has been great to have my Tolkien library complete and in one place.
3,Book Reader,"This item that I purchased was ""ok"". It was a gift for a Lord of the Rings Fan. The case that it came in was slightly ripped, but the books in it were in good condition. I received my order in a timely manner and was overall pleased with my purchase."
4,collected works,"It's been a while since I was able to read the original trilogy, so after I did, I bought this boxed set. I like boxed sets, especially for serial material, as it looks better on the shelf."
1,Disappointing,I was extremely disappointed in the whole set of books. I wouldn't recommend them to anybody. Lord of the Rings was so good that I assumed anything written by the same author would be good and worth reading but I got an unpleasant surprise.
3,Needs to be updated,I ordered this book for my 6 1/2 yr old son who always tries to follow along with the missel but has a hard time. I love the layout and simplicity of this book but it does not include the changes recently made to the Mass so it won't really teach him properly. I was surprised that the book cost almost $12 - I didn't realize I was going to get 10 of them! If the updates to the Mass were made I would give the book 5 stars.
1,Not a package of 10.,Thought I was going to get a package of 10. All I received was a package of 1 used book for this order.
1,The Joke Was On Me!,"I love tacky/kitschy Christmas items and thought this would be a fun book to add to my library. Maybe some ideas decorating or using that wonderful stuff from the fifties and sixties? Wrong! It's not Kitsch, it's just plain dumb. Although some of the recipes might be worth trying if you want to re-create a classic fruit cake, why on earth would you add wheat grass to make it ""completely inedible"".I'm always open to new ideas and love to have fun things around, but for the life of me I can't find one thing in the entire book that I would try to use for a fun holiday. The white powder donut tree? Nope. The rubber glove tree or the weenie tree -- I think not.Yeah, I can take a joke and the book is meant to be one. But this joke was on me for spending the money on it."
3,Where's the website?,"This book looks at scripting from a conceptual point of view. I enjoyed its form and content. The examples of work were inspiring.Why do I give this 3 out of 5 stars? I feel slightly miss led. On page 94 the authors write ""Scripts from tooling experiments are available at www.arandalasch.com/tooling"". Yet the site doesn't exist! The authors have yet to create this accompanying site that could give more tangible insight into the nitty-gritty of scripting. I assume it won't happen as its been more than a year now since the book was published. Too bad, because there are really few books that get into the details of scripting without becoming ""programming books"". Aranda and Lasch could have been pioneers in this area as they seem to enjoy the hands-on aspects of making stuff. Instead, they have dropped the ball.The book is full of pseudocode which is fine if you already know how to program. But for DIY beginners like myself, its just not enough..."
2,Conceptual Analysis with Little Detail,"Aranda/Lasch provide a glimpse of what algorithmic techniques in architecture are capable of producing. Spiraling, packing, weaving, blending, cracking, flocking, and tiling are briefly defined, and their conceptual application in architecture is explored.Although interesting, the discussion is left at a highly conceptual level, and the book could benefit from more detailed exploration and explanation. A website promising programming code to accompany the techniques has yet to be developed (and 2 years from date of publication probably never will) and does not appear to require the purchase of the book in order to access if it ever does go online.A better discussion of algorithmic architecture can be found in Kostas Terzidis' Algorithmic Architecture, which not only shows better developed architectural projects but provides an analysis of code scripting."
5,a useful TOOL,"If you just started to dive into the world of algorithmic architecture, this is a great book to have. The graphics are great, the layout is clean and attractive and the concepts are very valid."
4,action,The book updates the latest trend and concept of architectural actions. I find it very useful tool to have.
5,"Old, out of print, but best guide to Japan ever","I live about 1/2 time in Japan and this is the only indispensible guide to the country as a whole.Use Time Out Tokyo if you are only going to Tokyo.However, Kodansha has stopped printing English language books so it is a little dated. Since the price of most things in yen has not changed much since it was written it is still valuable, just convert using the current conversion rate.Very, if at times all too complete, history, background, what to see, where to stay (still reasonably good) and an excellent introduction to the nation's culture.The only comparable guide in completeness and quality is the old, old JTB Guide which has not been republished since the mid-60's Still good for historic places, but super expensive to get a used copy.Ted Childers"
2,It is so hard to read that the attractions listings are almost useless,"On the plus side, I really am enjoying the 1-3 page history asides--they give a really interesting background to individual cities or areas.The text, however, is very cramped, and therefore hard to read. The text is small and there's very little whitespace around paragraphs, between lines, etc. The letters are so small that the font almost looks fuzzy. I realize that allows a lot more to be crammed into the pages, but it is so hard to read that I keep turning to other guidebooks to plan our upcoming trip to Japan since reading this one is so difficult it makes it hard to concentrate."
5,The Best of the Lot,"I recently completed a 19 day trip to Kyoto and Tokyo. If there is a perfect comprehensive guide to Japan I have yet to find it, despite buying 6 of them. This was the best of the lot. Especially helpful was the star ranking of sights which was very well done and generally reliable. The descriptions were a bit brief for my taste but more comprehensive than the other guidebooks I had. The historical and cultural information was outstanding. The restraunt and hotel information was useful although I supplimented it with other books. The only glaring weakness was finding sights using the maps in the book. The sights aren't numbered, and it was sometimes hard to even find the right map to use. Because of the map problems, it would be too frustrating to use this as a sole guide. In all other respects, it's good to excellent. I primarily used this book and the Eyewitness Japan guide for sightseeing. They made a good combination."
5,The greatest,"Having lived in Japan for the past 6 years, I've had the opportunity to use all of the major guidebooks (and quite a few of the minor ones as well), and without a doubt, the most useful and informative guidebook is this one. Of course Lonely Planet has lots of information about restaurants and hotels, but you can get the tourist information center to help you with hotels and wherever you walk you can find plenty of nice restaurants. What you really want is a purpose to visit the places that you are visiting. Lonely Planet just tells you what things are, but this guidebooks tells you the history of each place, so you can understand why each place is important. If you're looking for a guidebook to tell you where the clubs, hangouts, and youth hostels are, then maybe this isn't the book you're looking for. However, if you're looking for a nice meaty book to feed you mind on, this is it."
5,Bravissima La Scotto!!!!,"This recording of La Traviata is easy to pass by, but please don't. It's an unbelievably moving experience. Renata Scotto in her absolute prime sings like a choir of angels, her Violetta is a real person, so touching, so finely drawn that it's impossible to fault, singing like this comes only once every hundred years."
5,A most touching La Traviata,"Renata Scotto is one of the XXth Century greatest sopranos, and one who invariably gave all of herself. Her Violetta is so touching, so deeply felt, that it is truly one of the greatest of all recorded operatic portrayals."
2,Not happy # 2,"I purchased the booties of same brand; see my review on booties, feel the same about mitts. don't waste your money.Susan"
3,A 6th grade teacher in Rhode Island,"This is a book with a good, believable story that helps give the reader an inside look at life in a Guatemalan village. However, the author spends a good deal of time and a good deal of figurative language attending to the setting and feelings of the character. Since it is set in a place that is unfamiliar to many U.S. readers, this may be necessary, but for my younger readers, it meant the story moved along a bit too slowly. For many of them, reading the book became a painful process."
3,Can you say Soap Opera?,"Oh my god, this book was exactly like a soap opera. I mean, Isabel loves Lucas, but she's talking to Allen Waters, a doctor, and Lucas thinks she likes him. Isabel's ""best friend"" Teresa, still likes Lucas, they used to date so she tells Lucas a pack of lies, and at the end...guess what??? .... I highly reccomend it for people who like sappy love stories. The plot's ok, Isabel wants to be a teacher, but her mom, Manuela, is dying so she can't go to school. You figure it out."
2,Take it or leave it!,"I was dissapointed in this DVD. It is ""lightweight"" and doesn't go into the depth that it leads you to believe it does. It's over before you know it and left me dissatisfied."
2,Not a Reliable GFCI Tester,I am a home inspector. Bought the Ideal 61-534 primarily to get a reasonably priced GFCI and circuit tester with bright LEDs instead of the dim neon bulbs in the cheap testers available at big box and hardware stores. I found that this unit works well to find breakers. Nice bonus. And the LEDs are bright so getting circuit conditions on exterior electrical receptacles in direct sunlight is a breeze. But problems occurred last week while inspecting a 20 year old home. The -534 when inserted into a GFCI-protected receptacle immediately tripped the master GFCI without me pressing the button. Had to revert to my cheapo tester to finish the job. When I returned home I tried this device on my own ground fault circuits and it worked fine. Be aware that this device may act funny if relied upon for GFCI testing in older homes. I have notified the distributor and am attempting to return the device for a full refund.
5,Actually Finds the Correct Breaker Every Time,"If you need a breaker finder, this is the tool to buy. Follow the directions and it will accurately find the correct breaker every time. I am totally happy. It also locates voltage in wires and in some cases traces wires in walls. It also includes a GFCI Tester. However, Ideal makes several other models that look like the 61-534. Some of those are worthless. Make sure that you buy the professional model, #61-534 Circuit Breaker Finder with Digital Receiver."
5,Ideal circuit seeker,This is appropriatly named it works perfectly for me every time. It is ideal for the task at hand woth every penny from Amazon.
5,Outstanding representation,The seller was very honest in their representation of this product and I received it fairly quickly (within a week).
4,Great songs!,The music is the same from when I listened to the album as a child in the 80's. The music is classical country and timeless. The only regret is that it has not been digitally remastered for CD quality which is why the 4 stars. It sounds identical to the records growing up. That being said I recommend the CD unless you crave your music to be remastered to CD quality. If you don't care then buy all means buy the CD and let the music take you back.
3,Pricey Knowledge for Newbies,"The book is written in the Microsoft step by step style. Fundamentals in the title translates to newbies with no knowlege of programming. The examples are short, one liner code. As far as it goes its a fine book, but pricey. Microsoft charges a premium for its books and this is no exception. Other Publishers do a better job by giving you more for your money. Before getting this book look at the Que, Dummies or Sams Publishing (Teach Yourself) titles."
1,Copy,This book is a copy of Access 97 visual basic step by step. Author did not talk about new tools that Access 2000 offers
2,For Beginners Only!!,"I received this book with the ""Mastering Series""... boy what a dissapointment! If you have programmed in Access at all, then don't bother with this one. However, if you never have then this is a good beginning."
3,A Begineers Book,"This book follows the Step by Step series style. It is for newbies with no knowledge of programming. Their is very little code in the book and it basically shows you how to put simple one liner code behind forms and reports. If your a newbie, it's a good start, for anyone else it's just too basic."
2,I don't get what all the hype was about,"These work if you just want to lightly wipe down a bathroom or kitchen floor, but they don't work for any actual cleaning. After you open the package, even if you keep it closed between uses, the cloths begin to dry out quickly. They clean unevenly and don't last very long. I don't recommend them - they're just not worth the money."
2,Slippery,"While this product cleans the floor well, the floor is very slippery while still wet and if used in a small space leaves thick film behind."
5,Great Tie!,Good quality nice looking tie. Wore it with a tuxedo for the 2013 Official Presidential Inaugural Ball -- it looked great!
5,Great Tie,Very nice tie and good quality and pattern. Would definitely recommend. Look on YouTube for video on how to tie.
5,Well Made and looks as advertised,"It is difficult ordering ties on line. The fabric, weave, etc. is hard to discern from a picture. I am very pleased with this tie and will purchase more from this company."
3,Does not live up to it's own hype.,"According to the ""blurb"" on the book's back cover, this author was given ""unprecedented access to the investigative procedures of the experts who pick up the pieces."" Firstly, I know of no expert or department of any Company, Organisation or Government who could ever become responsible for - or even able to, pick up the pieces of a shipwreck disaster. Secondly, unprecedented access to any investigative procedure is of no use to anyone. What he should have sought was unprecedented access to their findings.In short, this book is a collection of short stories about maritime disasters in general and, very predictably, it just had to start with the Titanic. Having reduced that great but tragic story to just 10 pages, we then get an overview of Bulk Carrier, Cruise Liner and Tanker losses - to mention but some.This book is not of any use to me as a shipwreck historian and researcher and I would suggest it is of limited interest to those who are new to the subject.NM"
3,Mahjong towers eternity,"I think young adults may like this mahjong gam, but Im a senior citizen and I like other mahjong games better."
4,mahjong,"seems i got the product(fun to play)before i had ordered it, it came so fast. enjoyable game."
4,Mom loves it,"My mom is addicted to Mah Jong. While there are some she likes better, this was a good version. Addicting game!"
1,Mahjong Towers Eternity,"I purchased this game from another site, but it would not play on my Windows 7 Lap Top. I had to return it. I love Mahjong."
4,Love animated tile sets!,"Since I am a Mah Jong fiendd, I was pleasantly surprised that this game is different. Instead of the standard tilesets, this game offers animated tiles of cartoons. When you play a lot of Mah Jong, it gets boring looking at the same tiles. The other feature of this game is that you can download new layouts easily from the Mah Jong Towers player forum straight from the fame application. Also,at the player forum page, when you complete a layout, you can see your time in relation to other players for that layout. It only shows the top 50, but if you are in the top 50 it is exciting to see. If you wish to create a layout, you can do this also. Then other players can download your layout.I would recommend this game to other Mah Jong players, as it has layouts for everyone whether you are a beginner or expert."
3,mahjong game,I was expecting more possibilities between one play and another but I am enjoying it anyway.
2,Keeps Crashing,"I read the reviews before I purchased this game and wish I had taken their advice. The game played great for about 8 times and then as others have said it asks for a new version of the game. Then it won't stop asking until you either reboot your computer or as I did control,alt,delete for the task manager then I end the program. I thought it might be alright if I restarted my computer but no. I have removed the game from my computer and will try to reinstall it. If it happens again I will ask Amazon to stop allowing this game to be sold. I also want my money back even though it's only $9.00."
3,Difficulty with windows vista,"I purchased this version of mahjong for I really enjoy this game, however, after only playing it a few times, I continued to receive an error message to find the most current version of the game. I had to contact the manufacturer of this game and they tried to fix this problem, but now the game will not play at all. Do not waste your money on a game that won't play on windows vista. I am very disapppointed and will try again to fix this problem."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"THIS GAME WORKS FINE THE FIRST TIME YOU PLAY IT. THE SECOND TIME YOU ""TRY"" TO PLAY IT, IT WILL CRASH. A PAGE WILL TELL YOU TO GET THE LATEST VERSION OF THE GAME. I JUST PAID FOR THE GAME AND IT ALREADY WANTS YOU TO GET A NEWER VERSION OF THE GAME. ITS A GOOD GAME BUT THIS BAIT AND SWITCH HAS SPOILED IT. ALSO WHEN YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THE GAME, THE SCREEN IS FROZEN. YOU HAVE TO GO TO TASK MANAGER OR REBOOT. BAD BAD BAD!!!"
5,Mahjong Towers Eternity,What a GREAT game and lots of fun...not boring at all either.You cannot go wrong here!
1,Waste of time,"I purchased this game in 2008, and really enjoyed playing and creating my own layouts, it was fantastic! And then it shut me out, I lost all my layouts and had to start from scratch, so I started over, It went well for a while and then shut down again, everything gone again! Well I restarted once more about 3 weeks ago, and guess what? Everythings gone again. Now I am a very patient person and miss playing and creating the layouts, but really, the creator of this game should really try to make it a more reliable product, that is if they ever do an update. Game name JH29! Think twice before you purchase, its really frustrating."
2,mahjong tower eternity,this game was going along fine until it wouldnt allow me to play any longer until i do an upgrade. I dont much care about that happening. If I buy something I expect it to work all the time not just as long as the company wants it to work so i have to buy something or do an upgrade before it will play.
1,not want it looked like,"hard and can't wear it, the material is hard and not easy to wear I just don't like it I should have saved my money and got on from A&E"
1,Roll over and play dead,Much money can be lost using this system when it comes to rolling over your contracts. Take Caution.
2,Not good for the short-funded trader!,"An overpriced book. You would need a large account to trade this sysem in order to deal with large drawdowns that occur. If you have $2,000, you would only be able to trade oats. To summarize: strategies of buy-and-hold & buy-more-when-prices-go-down. No stop placement strategy is presented. The author is right that the markets change. I find this system rather inflexible, however.There is no substitute for disciplined study. Develop your own perfect system according to your account size, tolerance for risk, etc. Be sure to paper trade. Good luck!"
2,Be Careful!!!!!,"First - This books is blatent copy of ""Smart Trader by Dillon,"" or maybe Smart Trader was a copy of this book. Regardless - it does not address the issue of contract rollover. In futures, each time a contract expires you will be required to purchase another contract for a future month. Usually, these contracts are priced higher than what you just sold for. So basically, you will lose money each time you rollover.If you get lucky you may make money by picking a bottom using this method. If you are forced to hang onto the trade for too long of a period you will watch your chance of profit slip away.Be careful!!!"
2,A book for beginners,"This is a good book for someone who is just beginning in coaching baseball, not for someone who has been in the game for any lenght of time."
5,The Best!!!,"This is some GOOD Reggae!- Its even better than Raggae Gold '98 which was pretty good too. If you like Raga (as opposed to Raggea which is slower), then you'll definately like this."
1,Three Gothic Novels,"The stories themselves, are great. However, when I received the book, it fell apart the first time I opened it! It wasn't in good condition as promised. :("
2,Carefull!,"Don't rate this cd on the strength of hearing Who am I? in a mixed cd. this cd, on a whole, is weak! You'ld be better off buying something like ""The Doctor"" or ""Maestro"". Stay away from ""Art & Life"".Credible tracks include Oysters & Conch, Steve Biko & Foundation. Apart from that, I don't know what else to tell you. Sorry Ras Moses.PeaceKader"
4,Great blend of traditional and dancehall reggae,"A valiant effort by one of Jamaica's most noteworthy artists, Beenie Man's ""Many Moods of Moses"" is a noteworthy blend of traditional reggae music with the more popular dancehall forms of the present. Unlike previous albums, ""Moses"" provides listeners with an eclectic blend of musical genres that range from beat-laden hip hop to a quirky country tune found on the album's fourth track. In any case, this album gives us Beenie Man at his best; master of modern reggae."
5,The Perfect Mousepad,"I have used this mousepad for several years and have never had wrist problems again. When my husband started having wrist problems, he borrowed it and found it was perfect for him as well, so now I've bought two of them. I highly recommend it."
2,Bummer,This product was portrayed as brand new. HAH!! The blister pack was broken open the product was damaged and cannot work as designed this whole experience was a disaster.Bob
2,Causes back pains,"This is the first mouse pad I use and maybe I do not know how to use them, but it appears to be too hight for my wrist. As a result, I do not have a good grip of the mouse, and if I manage to, my elbow ends up up in the air making me sit in this crooked position. It all makes me feel a tension in my right upper back and shoulder."
4,"Large surface area, easy on my wrists","I purchased this item several months ago after a lack of keyboard and mouse wrist support left my wrists in braces for a while. Along with this item, I also purchased a Fellowes wrist rest for the keyboard. Using the two wrist rests together, I have not had any new carpal tunnel flare-ups.I have an optical mouse at home, so I was used to having the entire surface of my desk to use as a mousepad. Switching from that to a more limited space took some getting used to, but this mousepad offers more space than most others that come with a wrist rest. I also like the way the gel part slides around with my hand when I'm moving the mouse.The reason I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 is that the gel is a little hard, much harder than my keyboard wrist rest (made by the same company). It's a little less comfortable than it would be if the gel were softer, but it's far, far better than having nothing at all."
1,This didn't work for me.,"The idea sounds great, but it just doesn't work too well. Whenever you pick up your hand off the mouse it's hard to get started again."
5,Get used to it!,"I'm on the computer eight hours a day....At times the wrist pain is unbearable. I bought this wrist rest/ mouse pad in a desperate act....and I'm so glad I was that desperate. I will admit that it took some getting used to but I have not had one ache in my wrist since getting it one month ago. I love that the wrist rest moves with you (that's the part that took some time getting used to). Yes, it's ugly. Yes, it takes up valuable real estate on my small desk. And, yes I would buy another one."
5,Best Razor On The Market For Women!!,"I bought this razor over a year ago, and I wouldn't trade it in for any other razor out there. It really does leave your skin super smooth. I love the triple blades on it so I know I can get a close, comfortable shave, even in hard to reach places. Thanks to the pivoting head, it moves with the curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut. It's also excellent for shaving the underarm area. I find that one stroke is all it takes, and you have a smooth appearance you have to feel and see to believe. This is truly a remarkable product for the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day, or more than three times a week. With this razor, it shaves so close to the hair follicle, you will be shaving in less time, less often. I will never part with my Venus razor. The best part is - it's a bargain for what you get!!"
5,A book to live by,"If I had only one book to read and re-read, this would be it. Far and away my favorite translation of the book that is part of my blood and bone. I've memorized much of it, and have read it aloud onto CD as a gift for my friends. A treasure. ""Let life ripen and then fall. Force is not the way at all."""
5,This translation will change your life for the better.,"I found this book (or it found me) at the right time a hundred years ago and reading it has made all the difference in the world -- my life wouldn't have been a fraction of what it has been if I had not opened this translation one morning many years ago.""From wonder into wonderExistence opens."""
5,The Definative TAO,Witter Bynner re-presents the (great and simple) truths of the TAO with great fidelity. You have the sense that Laotzu was a co-conspirator in this one which is more than can be said for some translations of this work. The irrefutable truths of the heart are presented here. Dont miss it
3,Not my favorite version,"I really disliked this book, but for a petty reason, so I won't give it a petty star rating of one. I'll give it a three, simply because it isn't a poor rendition or overly complex, but I'm afraid I can't get past the western rhyme scheme (AABB, etc.) that he has put in maybe a fourth of the ""verses"" in the book. I feel the western rhyme scheme completely ruins the flow and meaning of the message. I would recommend Gia-Fu Feng's translation of the Tao Te Ching, because it is concise in a way that I feel would do justice to the original."
3,Yep they break,Not bad throwing knives. I have 6 of them to go with my other throwing knives. After about 50 throws one snapped in half at the G as others have said. Looking at the cross section of the break you can see they are very poorly cast. Expect these to break if you throw them. They are a pretty cheap price and fly fairly true so oh well. I TIG welded the broken one back together and will see if it remains that way. These are truly a cheap Chinese Knock-off of real SOG Knives but you get what you pay for.
3,Lite weight,"Weight is on the lite side, feels good in the hand. Releases smoothly. Had to add weight by using 550 cord and tape on the handle, still lite. Then tried using just a leather handle, still a lite throw. The best throwing knife I have so far is the SOG Seal Pup after that would be Cold Steel True Flight Thrower. Only because I've replaced the 550 cord Handel several times after cutting the cord with the follow up throw."
3,They definitely break right at the 'G' in the handle...,"After just 3 or 4 throws, one of them just freakin' broke in half right at the G in the handle. I applied some electrical tape, super tight, around the handle on the the other knife and it's been hanging tough so far. I have to say that when not worried about them breaking in half, these knives are pretty damn fun to throw. The E tape hasn't thrown them off balance. Kinda cheaply made from SOG I have to say....but pretty cool action and balance."
4,Great knife,"This is a great knife, very sharp blade that keeps its edge nicely. Very well balanced and weighted, feels good in your hand. The knife is weak at the ""G"" in SOG, has a tendency to break there if you throw it too much, which this being a throwing knife, is pointless. But it comes in a pack of 3 for a price of 1, so I just wrapped some 550 cord around the handle and now I've got 3 great outdoor knives.By the way the sheath is very nice,holds all 3 knives comfortably and fits to your belt to wear around.This is for how to wrap the handle with 550 cord, I would suggest doing that.[...]"
2,Not as tough as I would like.,"These knives are pretty sharp and hold a decent edge even after a bit of throwing, but they are brittle and tend to break where the letter ""G"" is located on the handle. After buying this set for my wife, two of the knives broke within two or three days. I wouldn't pay this amount of money again for a set of this quality."
1,Really?,How did this product make it on Amazon? Really? Its like $6 at Home depot but you could buy it on Amazon and pay $56 in shipping! I'd like to see them try to ship it! Can I request gift wrapping?
2,"Kind of fun, monotonous","Beyblades for PS1 is O.K., graphics nothing special. To do the 2-player mode was so confusing I gave up trying to do it.Here's what the back of the case promises,""Feel the excitement as D.J. Jazzman(Beyblade announcer) emcees it."" What a bunch of fibs. D.J. is sooooo annoying and repetitive it's best to turn the volume low.For Beyblade fans, you may enjoy this game, but I sure didn't."
2,The game that gives you seivures.,"... When I first got it I thought it would be great but then while I am reading through the instruction manual the first thing it says is, ""This game might cause epileptic seivures."" The game is tons of fun for about 3 hours but you know it gets really boring after time. It was ok but take it from me before you buy it rent it."
4,true color of dalvid coverdale--which is now dead and gone,"Let me be brief and simple on this ablum. If you think your musical taste is closer to Blackmore than to Coverdale this album is a disaster. Otherwise, this is a evidence of what makes David Coverdale such a great singer. Jazzy, bluesy and a little bit funky sound clearly shows why he and Blackmore couldn't go along together. I'm not saying Coverdale is better and Blackmore is bad or vice versa. What I'm trying to make it clear is that they were so different. ""Blind Man"" is my favorite track here. Sadly, Coverdale later remade this track in a shorter, mediocre version in ""Ready & Willing"" album. I believe that proves that he lost his true color after all."
1,Not Compatible,"I've tried 2 of these refurbished cardone MAF'S for my '05 Tiburon SE 2.7L V6. Neither of them worked. Idle is horrible, fuel economy went to hell, check engine light came on, and vehicle wont accelerate properly between 3k and 4k rpm's. Make sure to buy a new hyundai part if you intend to have your vehicle in good working order. It's a lot more expensive from the dealer, but it actually works."
4,"A little rough around the edges, buuuut...","...you have to expect that listening to a CD compsed by Jeff Tweedy's with his ""unusual"" tastes in sound. Jeff Tweedy never fails to impress me with his unique song writing and vocal skills. Each of his side-projects aside from Wilco (Minus 5, Uncle Tupelo, etc.) are great, and this CD adds to the list of fantastic groups. I wish that there had been more melodic tunes such as Elegant Transaction, which is beautifully composed and put together with O'Rourke's soft voice. Jeff Tweedy, I feel, is perhaps the most legit band front-runner of today's rock/alt. country bands. If you enjoyed this CD, I definitley would recommend listening to Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and their new CD A Ghost is Born."
3,"Well written, convincing evidence against counting.","This book had credible evidence against counting, but doesn't offer much in terms of providing any unique and refreshing betting strategy. I've used this system for 20 hours, never went down more than $50, but never went up that far either. I usually get impatient and dump the system and start betting more randomly,which is more risky, but more fun too!!"
1,That book do not offer what is pretend,"The table of content seem right, with history of blacjack and its turn around, myth of counting, and offering new technics. The author do not show or proof anyway that counting is not working at date. His technics is just a simple positive progression betting...which has to be clear in everyone head that no betting method works!! Blackjack is a dynamic game (mean change depending of player action) but with limited possiblities... therefore any sequence of bet is consider static and will not follow the rythm of the game. (except for ""Double-up"" because of its continous recovering action) The book is very short of ideas and content. I am deceive of this authors being so sure his method works."
5,"""SHE AIN'T AFRAID TO TELL IT , LIKE SHE SEES IT""","3 WORDS THAT BEST DESRIBE SANDRA, FUNNY, FUNNY,AND FUNNY-SHE TRULY CRACKS ME UP!-HER SENSE OF HUMOR, STYLE IS DIFFERENT AND WELCOMING. SHE JOKES ABOUT EVERYONE FROM A TO Z- THE SONGS SHE SINGS ARE FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING AS WELL- ""ON THE RUNWAY"" WAS HILARIOUS-IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT-YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING -DON'T TAKE IT SO SERIOUS-JUST LAUGH AND ENJOY- THAT'S WHAT I DID- GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT!"
1,KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING FUNNY TO BE SAID,"THIS DVD WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. THE HUMOR IS STRICTLY HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP CRAP, WITH NOTHING THAT RELATES TO THE AVERAGE FOLK. I WAS KIND OF DISGUSTED BY A COMPLETELY SEE THRU DRESS, ESPECIALLY ON A PREGNANT WOMEN. I DIDNT ORDER FOR THAT KIND OF THING. I WANTED COMEDY, AND THIS AINT IT. IRREVERENT IS ONE THING, REVOLTING IS ANOTHER. I NEVER LAUGHED ONCE DURING THIS DVD. THE HUMOR ALMOST STRICTLY PERTAINED TO HOLLYWOOD PERSONALITIES AND THEIR EXPLOITS (WHICH I NEVER FIND THAT ENTERTAINING). SHE DOES HAVE A GOOD SINGING VOICE, BUT I DIDNT ORDER FOR SINGING EITHER. YOU WONT FIND MUCH COMEDY HERE. JEWEL"
3,Not exactly what you NEED,"This looked like a good product to me, being that I am a perfectionist and love giving CDs to my friends for an extra birthday present. This package comes with inserts for the back cover and a foldable leaflet for the front cover. First off, these inserts are made of a solid thin white cardboard, which is very sturdy. One good thing about the cardboard; it is pre bended and even provides lines edging the leaflet and back. But then for printing reasons its quite terrible, because the ink seems to bleed if you chose a higher print quality. Also, the ink takes quite a long time to dry, and when it is dried sometimes the ink chips! Another thing is when the leaflet is folded, because with all of the ink on the leaflet, it tends to slightly stick together. Bottom line, use high gloss paper for your inserts and not this product!"
3,Seems ok,"I don't know much about strops, but this seems to work moderately well, but not overly well. Its small size makes it handy for keeping in the kitchen. I only use it for knives, but the convex edges would allow it to be used for other toolsIt's not overly well made, but adequate for its purpose. You may have to do a little re-gluing of the leather to the wood, and the little cushion pad on one side of the bottom, and the emery cloth on the bottom, as I did, but no problem.Its only real problem is the emery cloth applied to the bottom. It may scratch any surface that you set this on. I just hold it in my hand when using, but being able to set it down would be better. I suppose I could take off the emery cloth, as I don't use it.The paper that comes with it is more informational than instructional. It could use instructions on where and how to apply a grinding compound. When and how to remove it."
5,A Scientifically-Faith Based History of Civilization,"In this edition of a coming seven volume set, Dr. Carroll, in a very scientific yet faith-based manner, presents the history of man from his creation to the early apostolic times. Dr. Carroll supports all of his claims with a respectable sense of reasoning and support from reliable resources. Although he presents this history from the perspective of a believer, he, nevertheless, challenges his own claims and presents his answers to those challenges. His honesty and objectivity are a welcomed relief in this time of revisionist history that often demands more faith than the writings of this Christian scholar. This is a must read for all serious historians because a history of the West is not complete without a history of Christendom."
4,I am pleased with the product.,So far it is working well for us. Took a while for my dog to get use to the magnetic flaps but he is getting there. Haven't had any cold weather so yet to see how well it keeps out the cold.
2,Not for a 2 x 6 wall,"This door is ok, quality is not great, vinyl doors get hung up in frame, did not fit a 2 x 6 wall as described, chute they go thru is not long enough. Not impressed."
2,Not that great anymore,"This is the third dog door from this vendor that I have installed and the quality of the product has gone down considerably. The plastic tunnel is now so flimsy that the corners come cracked. I returned the first one sent to me and the second one had the same issue. I was able to repair the cracked corner and complete the installation. I had to uninstall the door to put in the ""optional"" bracing under the tunnel. My dog would not go through it because the floor was too weak and bowed when she tried to go through. BTW, my dog is 7 pounds and the travel from the outside to the inside is about 6 inches."
4,Good door,"I bought this door so I could put my cats' litter box in my garage. I bought this size rather than the ""cat"" door because one of my cats is 15 lbs. and there was no way he was going through that tiny thing. It took very little time to install (despite some odd wall construction in my house). The cats have more or less learned to use it, although I still have the interior flap propped open with a box. I do wish there was an easy way to keep the flaps open during training or remove them and then reattach them.As far as functionality, the door seems to be well-designed. There isn't much air movement through it with both flaps closed."
5,Works great,"Took my dog a few days to figure out the trick to using this dog door as the two flaps are quite a ways apart due to the thickness of the wall, but she figured it out and now uses it with ease. I had it professionally installed but he had no issues with installing it at all."
3,"Not bad, not great","The others reviews state its not all Aluminum, which is true and the hols for the screws will snap if you tighten to much, Do NOT use a drill to tighten the screws. Also if your walls are wider than standard 2x4's it will be too small... This would have been nice to know before I cut my walls so be prepared to get out the Aluminum tape to seal the gap between the two halves if you have 2x6 walls like I had to."
3,"Cheap and overpriced for the quality, but works","The door works and the instructions are adequate, but it really is light and cheap feeling, especially during the install. If the cut opening is a little off, the door will deform and still ""fit"" (do not do this). The mateup of the two pieces inside the door is poor (the smaller one was quite a bit smaller and left a gap), but you do not see that part once the install is complete.The door is good and my dogs (tell me that they) like that it is soft. I had no problem getting them to go through the door where I have had a harder time with the single, hard doors.It works, but for the price I expected better quality."
3,"not impressed for the money, but you can't really do any better","The black part is plastic, the white part is aluminum... So to call it aluminum is a tad bit misleading... anyway... it's not super duper air tight, but it's pretty good. I don't regret getting it, I'm just not impressed."
3,Does what it's supposed to do.,"The dog door worked the way it's supposed to and does what I needed it to do. However, the tunnel is rather flimsy at the corners and one split on me. I reinforced all of the corners with some duct tape before installing, which I would rather not have to do. It took me a long time to install, mainly because I had siding on the outside of the house that I had to trim out and a couple plugs to move. The other issue I have with this is that the magnets on the two doors often stick together, which means one door usually is not sealed, which lets a lot of cold air in the house."
2,does not work well,"I had one of these before and my son has one as well. The door worked just fine. This one is awful. The outside metal peice popped off in less than a week. I screwed it back in and it's holding for now. I put the barriar in yesterday, and one of my dogs went right through it and pulled the metal piece out on the inside. I had to find different screws to sort of hold it together. Nowe I have to find a door that will work for this house, becuase this one just doesn't do it. If you don't have studs on both sides of the tunnel, this door just falls apart with regular normal use."
3,Adds a lot of cold to the room...,The dogs get through it OK but the magnets seem a little too strong and it has visible air leaks in the lower corners of the flaps.
3,Made of Cheap Material,"I gave it a 3 stars since it is functioning as intended but it is made of cheap material. It is not properly sealed on the aluminum corner. It has gap inside where you can see the light from the outside. There is also sharp edges on the corner of the aluminum cuttings. Also, you need to install a wood on the base on the telescoping tunnel since it is made of a very thin plastic and it will crack if your dog is heavy."
2,Aluminum? What Alumnium?,"I ordered two of these doors (for walls) based on its good reviews and because it had an aluminum frame.Unfortunately, this product is about 95% plastic and rather flimsy. If you have one dog who might only use this occasionally and isn't very robust or athletic, this dog door might work for you. But if you have active, energetic dogs, Labradors, for example--I'd suggest a sturdier model. The only part on this dog door that is aluminum is the actual frame that holds the flap.It's very inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. The install seems easy enough, but this door would only last a month with my dogs."
3,"Works, but major flaws in construction and quality","All of the screws on the interior and the exterior of the door stripped out of their plastic ""casings"" in less than 24 hours of installation. The problem occured again within another 24 hours. Because my husband is a contractor, he was able to install screws with toggles, to ensure that the door would not continually fall apart. Also we installed the door in a standard 6x2 wall and the door was not deep enough. Even though we were able to make our own nesessary repairs to the door so that it was functional, we are very displeased with the construction and quality of this product. It was over $100 and we couldn't recommend it to anyone at this point. It is far from ""energy effiecent"" since there are large gaps between the pieces and at each top and bottom point in the door frame. Buy it, but be prepared to make adjustments for real functionality."
2,Petsafe telescoping wall entry pet door,"The PetSafe telescoping wall entry pet door looks good and had very good instructions with one exception. All homes in Oregon are built with 2"" X 6"" walls. The telescoping function of this pet door only fits 2"" X 4"" built walls. There is nothing in the write up or in the instructions to tell you this important fact. Also after one week of use, the outside frame screws fell out and it needed repair. .PetSafe Telescoping Aluminum Wall Entry Pet Door, LargeThe optional installation kit is relatively expensive and totally worthless. Not enough of the sealant or the weather striping was provided. No instructions provided.PetSafe Universal Pet Door Installation KitBut the dog likes his new door."
3,needs improvement,"The material is ok, magnets seal the access fairly but in the frame needs seal i can see the light from outside and bugs and loose energy thru it.el material es bueno pero falta sellar algunos hoyos en marco por donde perdemos calefaccion y aire aun cuando este sellado con su tapa. denrian sellarlo mas , pero la idea funciona"
4,dog lover,The dog door is a bit pricey for being plastic but it does telescope out far enough to go through brick exterior. The two flaps are nice for Colorado winters!
4,Good Product,"Wall door works well, a bit smaller than the dog door we currently have installed on our patio screen door (went down in size from 7x9 to 5x7) so the dogs are getting used to the smaller entry. Other than that, works well. Look forward to no longer having to heat/cool the outdoors by leaving the sliding patio door open for the dogs to have access to the outside."
1,disappointed,i bought a medium of this and a medium is autually for small dogs my dog is 22 pounds and can barely fit the product itself is very nice but the sizing medium is not for a medium dog!!!!! the seller is perfect and very nice am happy with that
1,The plastic liner broke,"They advertise that this product is aluminum; however, only the outside frame is aluminum. The inside is plastic. We have two-40 lb dogs. After 1 year, the plastic liner at the bottom of the door cracked and then a large chunk broke off, exposing the inside of our walls. We have to replace the door."
3,Refine Design,"Overall, it works. But, our house is standard 2 x 6 construction w/1/2"" Drywall, 5-1/2"" studs, 5/8"" ext sheathing and 3/4"" ext siding = 7-3/8"". This product accomodates 7-1/4"" wall. I have a 1/8 gap between the telescoping walls. The plastic telescoping walls are too thin and not long enough to overlap each other. The holes in the frame for the screws are too close to the cut-out and need to be farther away for a secure install. You will need to install a 2x8 at the bottom cut-out where the animals may step. Especially for large dogs. Make sure the top of the cut-out is 1-2"" above the height of your dogs back to accomodate the bend in the flap as the dog goes through."
3,Lots of plastic.,"This product calls itself an aluminum dog door, which is kind of true. The white frame that you see in the picture is aluminum, but that frame is mounted to a plastic outershell (the part that actually goes through the wall). Maybe that wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that the aluminum frame is attached to the plastic shell with four screws that go straight throught the thin plastic with nothing behind them to help keep the metal frame attached. My Labs had knocked the out-side door flap off of the plastic shell within the first hour of use. The inside door lasted another day then also came off while the dogs were coming through the door. I had to go buy some machine screws with nuts to make the doors stay on for longer than an hour or so. So far with the new hardware, it seems to be working just fine, but it would have been nice if the company had used some decent attaching hardware in the first place."
4,Does everything it should,"This door came with good instructions and a pattern that made it very easy to install.I have two minor issues with the door. First, it has two flaps with magnets on the bottom to hold them in place (that's a good thing). The problem is that sometimes the two flaps will hit together and the magnets with hold them together which leaves the flaps a little open.The other problem is that the flaps don't have any sealing around the edges. The old door had a soft brush material around the sides of the flaps that helped seal the opening. I haven't noticed any problem with not having this on the new door, but I wonder if it will allow the wind to blow in, or allow cold air in. Only time will tell.The looks and ease of installation I think make up for the defficiencies I mentioned above."
4,Little short for 2x6 wall but works,"This door is great though my guys have had a little adjustment problem with the double door. Had to bait them with food and even tape it open for a time. The part that forms the between the inside and outside walls is a little flimsy--I hope it holds up. Framing this into a 2x6 new construction wall there really could be a little more material for the ""flimsy"" part to provide a little more overlap. Outside of that it is a good unit."
1,Very cheaply built,"Very cheap material, if you take any screw out and then if you need to put it back you will trip the plastic."
2,"Product is fine, shipping ridiculously slow","The product is fine, though for some reason the belt is thicker than the previous belt, so the machine runs much louder. The product took over two weeks to get to my house; if I had known that it would take that long, I would have purchased it elsewhere."
5,"Creative, original, peaceful...","I found that David Anthony is the most captivating piano player ever! And it's all very original. He has a story for every song he creates. When you listen to each song, you are there, you can feel what David feels. You won't be disappointed in David's music! The Black Hills really come alive in this creative music and it all comes from the heart. He is David Anthony Piano. Please don't deprive yourself of this most amazing piano player."
4,"Not a recipe, but a coaching guide",Dr. Wimberly hits the nail on the head with this great encouragement for parents. We believe it has already made a difference in how we view our job as parents with four children. Can't wait to have grandchildren and pass along this wisdom!
2,Pedantic,"The preface makes Garner sound very reasonable in the balance between prescriptivism and descriptivism. But I found it to be more schizophrenic, sometimes being very reasonable and sometimes being way too pedantic. Did you know that schism must be pronounced ""sizm"", and that pronouncing it ""skizm"" is unacceptable? I didn't.Many of the ""essay entries"" are interesting, but most of the book consists of dictionary-style entries dealing with a single word, and most of these are simply a chance for Garner to quote examples of misuse he's found from newspapers and magazines over the years. These soon take on an air of gloating. For example, in 1980, the New York Times wrote ""duel exhausts""instead of ""dual exhausts."" You can almost hear Garner going, ""Ha-ha!"" After a few hundred of these, it gets tiring."
5,unique reference tool,"one caveat: you must, really must read the preface to make sense of the use of this reference, but once you understand its structure, it's invaluable."
5,DMAU is a perfect antidote for poor usage,"Mr. Garner's book should be on your bookshelf if you want to be recognized for excellent usage of English. To illustrate good and bad usage, DMAU is full of documented examples from books and periodicals, as well as references to Fowler and Follet. Fortunately, Mr. Garner knows more often than not which contemporary usage battles to take sides on and which are better left conceded to the ""liberal linuguists."" Thus, the reader can focus on the goal of developing crisp, clear meaning in written and oral communication. Because poor communication is so prevelent in business and industry, you can be recognized as a ""transaction cost"" cutter in your organization if you master the techniques laid out by Mr. Garner. And with that kind of recognition, the book is sure to pay for itself several times over."
2,Does not work well as a reading glass,Could not see very well through the magnifier when I held it up to my face.
3,"OK product, BUT......",Works well enough except for the fact that it was intended to be carried in a pocket for travel. Not this one...too thick and bulky. OK for purse but not for a pocket.
1,not worth buying,quicken's rental property management(QRPM) IS FLAWED IN SO MANY WAYS IT IS NOT WORTH BUYING.I BOUGHT IT WITHOUT EVEN INVESTIGATING IT BASED ON INTUIT'S REPUTATION.I WISH I HAD LOOKED AT THESE REVIEWS FIRST. NOW I'M JUST OUT A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR A PROGRAM THAT PENCIL AND PAPER WOULD DO BETTER
1,Terrible product,"This product is terrible. It is very frustrating!! I see some reviews that say its easy to install, well that's true, but that's where it ends. I have 14 rental houses and one commercial building. There is no category for commercial buildings. Periodically all my data that you spend hours inputting becomes lost. This seems to happen every time you have an update from windows or who knows what causes it because the tech support sure doesn't. When you have renters move out, you can't keep the data from the old renters and update to the new. These things are not linked so you have to go back and input all the property information again and print out the old for taxes so you can have it manually. I really can not believe that they didn't have smarter programmers than this! If there was any way I could give this product less than one star I sure would!"
1,Save your money,"Anyone still thinking about buying this should look somewhere else - use MS money or a spreadsheet.Not only is it not very useful, but you can't even update the mileage rate on your own so you can't generate a correct end of year report. Quicken customer support says it will be in the next release. Well, it's already two years old with no updates in sight. Save your money and buy something else.I've always heard great things about Intuit but this and another of their popular tax programs have both been a major disappointment."
2,Quicken property manager,Quicken is a decent small number of rentals manager with helpful tax data presentation. The problem is that they are not friendly to previous purchasers. Anyone who buys this software should be prepared to pay full price for any upgrades. Most software I buy does offer a discount to upgrade to previous owners. I would be happy to pay a reasonable upgrade fee.
2,"Promising, but not ready for prime time","This will be a great piece of software one day. It is not yet. It is still essentially a ""beta"" version with many ""known issues"" (i.e. flaws and things that don't work) that you don't find out about until you visit Intuit's help site. I'm disappointed that Intuit would release a software package like this and charge full price when it still clearly needs a lot of work. The basic functionality is there, but I broke it four different ways just using it the first night. Like I said, when they get all the bugs ironed out, it will be a great piece of software. As of now, I feel disappointed and ripped off that they are charging full price for a prototype that doesn't work completely."
2,Very disappointing,"This product will be just fine if: you don't have to enter historical data, you're tenants never move out, you never sell a property, you don't mind entering data manually instead of having the program do it for you (silly you).I've been talking to Tech Support for three weeks now. To their credit, they are very responsive. But they keep telling me how great the updates are going to be; meanwhile, I'm loosing more time trying to figure the d*&% thing out. They swear they had property managers invovled in the program design. They must have been playing with Monopoly money at the time.Next time, guys, do the product tests on focus groups, not your (ex)customers."
2,Not for vacation rental property management!,"I have a resort condo that rents on a weekly basis, and I hoped to use RPM to schedule and track that activity. RPM is almost totally unable to do any of that. You can sort of jury-rig an entry, so that end-of-year reports will still be useful, but that is all it is good for..."
2,Disappointed and NOT recommended,"This is the first piece of Quicken software that has ever really let me down. Quicken Rental Property Manager 2.0 has turned out to be a fancy interface for a spreadsheet. While it will keep tenant information and track income and expenses by property, that's about all it will do. Do not expect to be abe to issue rent receipts or anything else. Buyer beware!"
4,Great Interaction,Great interaction among normal characters who are not presented as men and women of steel because they are cops. I wish there was more than one season of this show.
5,Jeremy Renner! Nuff said,"I was sad that I discovered this series three years too late...I love Jeremy Renner and this series packs in a lot of screen time for him.I think the show was good, the cast meshed well together and the dialogue was funny. I probably wouldn't watch it again, but I would recommend watching the season at least once."
4,What time slot was this in?,Never heard of this series before. Must've had poor marketing and publicity because it's an entertaining show. Love the chemistry between all the characters. And it has some really funny moments. Just finished watching the series through Amazon Instant Video at the Prime rate : ) I'd try to catch it if it was still on the air.
3,silly show,silly show but jeremy renner is hot. also i cant not watch the last episode of something. it has some funny bits and i like adam golberg so for $1 it wasnt too bad
3,small float,"this float is an ok float. seems to be made out of a thinner material and also made for small or skinny people as the float is very narrow. I didnt have a problem with it, but i could see that some people may. Overall it is a good float for the price. I dont think its one that will last from year to year."
3,float,"I bought one very similar to this, from Amazon it was wider and the pockets were silver and it had thicker material. I loved that float. this one is just too narrow so when your laying onit you feel like your going to tip over easy. I just wished it was 33 inches W instead of 27 enless your a skinny person"
5,Pretty durable raft,"Used this to float down the river on family float. Had cheaper ones before that always popped since we float on a shallow river with a gravel bottom. Bought one of these and have had it for several years, taking it on several floats each year. Very durable and well-made. Also holds air very well and supports your body very well...unlike the cheap rafts you can buy which don't last long at all and provide no support. Very comfortable and durable...would recommend it!"
5,Great buy,Took this on vacation for my husband who is a big guy and it held up great. He used each day without any trouble.
2,won't last too long,You will need to replace this every year. They are made of poor material. One season in the sun will destroy themBut okay to buy once every year and enjoy them. Price is reasonable
5,Nice and pretty durable!!!,"We have a couple of these that we have had for 5 years or more. They just keep on lasting. As long as you keep it away from sharp objects and don't drag it on the concrete, its pretty much good to go. The kids pile on it to see how many can fit. I figured it would pop but it hasn't so far."
5,This CD is very good,"There is a problem with a lot of the title not matching the tracks, when you try to lisen the Demo. I am probally one of the top 5 reggae listerners, and this like this should be corrected"
3,Unexpectedly fun music comes from this unusual ensemble.,"The other review here pretty much said it all for this album's music, but I would like to add comments on several aspects of the work. First, you will be amazed at how versatile an instrument the harmonium is; we expect it to be corny--and when need be, it is--but it can also be quite gothic or even rocking. Second, when you get this CD, give it one listen without reading the lyrics, and try to guess what the songs are about. You will startled by the gruesomeness of some of the lyrics, especially those which flow to bright, cheery tunes. Third, I want to applaud Alistir Cochrane, who translated the lyrics. The translations rhyme and scan to the tunes, thus making the songs accessible to English-speaking artists who want to borrow them. Fourth, I want to say that harmonium, fiddle, and voice work together much better than you ever would have thought."
3,a treasure!,Jeff Bridges was wonderful in this little gem- a hint of good things to come! What fun seeing Andy Griffith as a meanie! Glad I found this video at amazon.com
1,Wrong Issue Date,This is NOT the December 1965 issue. Either the sellers did not look at the book before listing their sale or whatever. let them look at the actual book and correct their listing. The volume # is correct but not the date.
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"I just finished reading this book again. This is one GREAT book. In a word, ""WOW"". Totally interesting and captivating all the way through."
5,WOW,"I'm only fourteen and I've read almost all of J.M's books and I love all of them. This one is one of favourites, if you haven't read SOMETHING WONDERFUL then read it and read this one. I own a lot of books and those two are my very favourites I must have read them thousands of times. SO if you want a good read......."
5,The best historical romance I have read,"I usually don't like to read sequels. So I read this book many years after I read my first Westmoreland story: Whitney, my love. I truly love that book, and this one is even better, or at least I don't want to compare them. I also like Paradise by Judith McNaught a lot, five star, highly recommended."
2,"A little romatic, midly sexy, and really average","Unfortunately, I was surprised to find that I didn't like this book. I had heard great things about J.M, but found her writing to be very normal. Nothing jumped out at me. Everything was luke warm. I am a fan of Diana Gabaldon (and believe no one can be placed in that category), but enjoy Karen Marie Moning as well. I also found it a little creepy that ""the wolf"" was nearly 30 (*I think*) and seducing a 17-year-old virgin. I know the times were different, but I was still displeased when he considered that his new lover may be with child, yet me might marry another. Again, I know the times were different and no, the ending was better than that, but still..."
3,It was just an OK,I couldn't get into this & I love historical romance & Judith McNaught. I found it too unrealistic. I don't want to give away spoilers so I'm not going to say more.
2,dissappointing,"I liked the book in the beginning. But almost halfway through the book, I realized Jenny was blind and unreasonable. She couldn't see what was right in front of her face. I wanted Royce to leave her and find someone else. He is a great hero who deserves a better heroine."
3,This Heroine was AWFUL...,"This is my first McNaught disappointment and it pretty much exclusively falls on the shoulders of Jennifer, the story's heroine. From the moment when she killed the H's beloved horse to the end where she ""proudly"" marches past her husband's (and her own) people to sit with her ""kinsmen,"" I DETESTED this woman. Royce was a real pleasure to read about and the only reason I carried on with the story. After all the great reviews, I am at a loss as to how this book can be compared with Perfect or Almost Heaven, both of which made me life-long McNaught fans. AKOD does not even come close."
4,Good book.,"I read this book and love it. It made me laugh at points as well as cry. I thought the character development wasn't extremely good but it was enough to make this a great book. I would suggest reading it if you have time. This book managed to hold my attention as well as create a world of its own inside my mind. I looked forward to picking it up when I had a chance. I am not an avid reader. I typically do not like to read books as a hobby so for this one to be able to hold my attention says so much for it. If you are a person who likes this book I would also suggest reading ""Velvet Fire"" by Elda Minger.Velvet Fire (Heartfire Romance)I have put the link in here for it."
5,"Bad Cover, Great Book","This was definitely a really great read. I absolutely loved the characters, some were mean and dark, others brooding, and Royce was a big, strong, lovable man. Jennifer, the main character was a little too pushy, but I loved her too. It took me a day and a half to read this, because I couldn't put it down. Once in a while these type of books interest me, and I am glad for it. A Kingdom of dreams is a gem worth your time."
4,great for mcnaught fans,"I've read most Mcnaught books, this one was particularly fun to read. Recommended for all historical romance fans out there..."
2,BUMMER!!!,"After reading books by Judith Mcnaught like ""Until You"", ""Perfect"", and ""Paradise"", this book was, to say the least, a let down. It was very predictable and very boring, and I haven't bought a Judith McNaught book since. I have lost faith in someone I used to say was my favorite author."
1,i don't like a munipulative hero,"I was unable to finish even half this book. Royce, the hero, manipulates Jennifer, the heroine, into becoming his mistress. The story line continues with Royce believing Jennifer has betrayed him...the hero and heroine continue to misunderstand one another. Ugh, frustrating."
1,A Really Bitchy Heroine,"I can't believe this is a Judith McNaught book. My god, how could she have written such a horrendous one? Contrary to what has been written in the reviews, I adamantly recommend that you do NOT waste your money on this book. Here's why:-Jennifer is a bitchy, bratty heroine who whines and is too ""silly, shrilly, and shrewish"" for her own good. She is so blind to her clan's faults that she gives Royce up for them (at that infamous tournament scene). I mentally screamed through the whole description of her riding away from her husband Royce's stand and joining her ""dastardly"" kin.Jennifer Merrick ruined the whole book for me. If you want a Judith McNaught book, try PERFECT or SOMETHING WONDERFUL. Now THEY are the better ones!"
1,the absolute worst!!!!!!!,"in contrast to all these raving reviews about how wonderful and incredible this book is, I have to say this is one of the most boring books I have ever read! where is the plot? the characters SUCK , they were so typical and bland. i have to say i don't really favor the time period but even then , this book almost made me fall asleep. actually, i didn't even finish it. i couldn't have even if i wanted to. don't get me wrong.....JM is my favorite author. i've read many of her books and Perfect is my all-time favorite book. now THERE is a book worth reading over and over and over. i've never read a book with so much emotion and empathy and the characters and plot are beautifully developed. how JM can be the author of both Perfect and kingdom of dreams, i have no idea.."
2,Not as good as her other works,"I was bored to tears with this Judith McNaught book. I bought it recently and am still regretting throwing away the receipt because I really want to go back to Barnes & Noble and exchange it for another book. I loved ""Something Wonderful"" and as a result am reading all of her other books. The only reason I did not give it one star was because Judith McNaught writes so well. I didn't sympathize with Jennifer at all and that was another problem. Jennifer, the name, only became common during the 20th century. I think having a Scottish lass being named Jennifer in the 15th century would have been very unlikely."
2,Hmmm...,"I hate to be the only one who didn't care for this book very much. However, I found it to be only a bit better than marginal. It started out fairly interesting, but quickly gave way to a disjointed story. When romance novels do this,it reminds me of a teenager writing about ""grown up"" topics. As for Royce and Jennifer; it has been only a month since I read this book and I had to look back at the product page to even remember them. I'm always looking for new (to me), authors. This one is a pass for me."
4,Absolutely wonderful!,The main characters were wonderful. They made me laugh and cry. And I cheered when Jenny finally realized where her true happiness lay.
5,Kingdom of Dreams was the perfect Fantasy novel!,"This novel was and has been my favourite of romances ever since I read it. I could not keep it down for a minute. I finished the book in a day and a half. It had the perfect blend of reality and fantasy mixed in with romance, adventure, kidnapping, rescues, escapes, and tournaments. In my opinion, anyone who loves Judith McNaught should quickly read this novel before any of her others. Nothing else compares to the waterfall of emotions you go through while reading this book. It is definately a must-read!!"
5,Superb...,...This romance was suspensiful as well as funny and sad. Judith McNaught is an excellent writer. I think her victorian and medevial time writings are the best of her talent. Waiting for another! Loyal reader.
5,A Good Read,"This book was so good reading that I could not put it down. I read it within two days! That is how good it was. When I finished reading it, I almost wanted to start reading it all over again. This is the first book I read by Judith McNaught that I picked up at a local booksale. Now I think I will read all the books available by J.M. I have read many fiction-romance novels. So far, this was the best. I enjoy reading books by Laurie Mcbain also, but this surpassed even Ms. Mcbains's novels. If you enjoy reading romance novels, this is one you should not miss!"
4,Heavenly,"I loved this book. After just finishing several Diana Gabaldon books I was in dire need of a Scottish-Highlander-Fix, so I ordered this book. At first I didn't think I was going to like it, as the writing is not as good as Gabaldon's, but in the end it was more than satisfying. I loved the strength of Jennifer's character, although she did frustrate me more than once for her unfailing loyalty to her horrible family. I mean, could she really be that blind to their cruelty? When she went with her Aunt to sit with her family during the games, my heart was breaking for The Duke. But in the end when she knealed before him, I thought it would burst. If you liked ""Whitney, my love"" you must read this. You'll love how she ties the stories together. This was my first Judith McNaught, but will not be my last. I have now read all of the Westmoreland stories, and look forward to reading more from her in the future."
5,A Keeper!,"I came accross A Kingdom of Dreams in a small used book store. Till this day I think I found a treasure. If you love passion, adventure, laughter and love this is the book to read. I have read it so many times and still I cry and laugh! I have yet to come accross an author that grabs you and takes you away like Judith does. Her stories are wonderfully written and grab you and never let go. You will not be dissapointed."
2,JUST OK,"THE PRINT WAS VERY DARK MAKING IT LITTLE HARD TO READ OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS JUST OK,JUST EXPECT BETTER."
5,The Best!,"I read this book about 20 years ago. Then reread it many times. Now I am looking to buy a new copy as mine got wet and had to throw it out. I cannot say enough about this book. It is true romance. It will make you laugh, cry, and sigh...Here you have Royce Westmoreland, the first Duke of his line. He is tough, strong, yet capable of a love so deep he would die for Jennifer Merrick. Even though there are many other books which are wonderful with great heroes and heroines and love so great, there is something so pure and unique about this one. It will leave you wanting more and you will want to reread the end before you close the book because you don't want it to end. If so, never fear. If you have not read Whitney My Love, now is the time! The hero in Whitney My Love is no other than the Duke of Westmoreland, descendant of Royce Westmoreland. A Kingdom of Dreams is at the top of my reread list. Royce Westmoreland...sigh..."
5,A GREAT Book! It completely blew me away!,"This book was SSOO Good! I couldn't put it down! I usually don't like historical romances, but this one was WONDERFUL!!! If I could put more stars, I would!!!"
5,Unbelievable,"This was the first full-blown historical romance I had ever read, and I have read it at least 6 times since then. The story is intriguing and surprising. I could not put it down! Jennifer is awesome in her spirit, pride and strength. Way to go!"
4,A beautiful read,I loved this book. The characters were very well developed and its had a great plot. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes historical romance.
2,Not For Me,"It must be me - I can't get into her books. This is the 2nd one I've tried. I put this one aside fairly quickly. I couldn't get past the horse scene - sorry. I guess I'm too much of an animal lover. After struggling through Whitney, My Love, I decided to pass on this one after I read about the horse. It seems she always has to have something disturbing in her books, and I don't care for that. I'm a wimp, I guess."
5,Judith McNaught is a dream writer.,"6 stars and more. This was my first exposure ever to romance novels 15 years ago and boy, did she REALLY set the high standard for me. KOD still remains my ultimate favorite romance novel (of all sub-genres). Trailing right behind are Paradise, Perfect, and all her historicals (not to be missed). I've also lost track of how many times I needed to reach for a tissue towards the end. I have yet to find a more poignant love story that grips at the heart as this one and I'm pretty sure it will remain that way for a very long time. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I absolutely adored it, my love for the love between Jennifer Merrick and Royce Westmoreland intensifying with each turning page. McNaught is truly one-of-a-kind and knows how to weave her stories beautifully and poignantly. As the titles suggests, this tale is a dream come true and still lingers close to my heart after over decade and a half."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"A Kingdom of dreams was the first book by Judith McNaught I ever ever read, and I am hooked. I have read this book 4 times and I just can't seem to get enough. It is not often you find a book where the heiron isn't a weak, spineless, crybaby, and Jennifer Merrik was anything but that. She kept Royce on his toes. And how often in a book do you see a girl who is not truly a godess sent to earth??? Jenny insists over and over again that she is plain. And could you ask for a better hero?? A warrior,smart, sexy and absolutly irrisistible. Everyone should read this book!!!"
4,Absolutelly captivating.,This book portays true love that keeps its promises. A real page-turner and a roller-coaster ride of emotions!
4,A delicious and amusing love story.,"As usual, Judith McNaught brings her characters to life by giving them real human attributes. The story is filled with tenderness, humor and great love scenes. Anyone who enjoys McNaught's writing will enjoy this book."
3,Takes time,"Very humorous story, but it took me many chapters to get to the point where I couldn't put the book down. I would recommend reading this book, because once you get there it's worth the time."
5,Romance to die for!,"This is my favorite Judith McNaught book, and yes I have read all of them. She is one of my favorite authors, and for sure my favorite Romance author. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!"
4,Useful & practical,"It's very useful for keeping lens caps attached to your camera so you don't have to look for where you last placed it. However, the adhesive in one of the items detached from the rest of the leash after a while. Also, the plastic that you bend around the D-ring is not flexible so it's a little difficult to attach. Overall however, it's a good product."
2,Not that great,"I thought these lens cap leashes would be great - I'd just gotten a Canon XSi and wanted to protect the caps of the two lenses (I often try to lose the caps to my husband's lenses). But, the tether isn't long enough to reach easily from the cap to the camera body, even for the smaller of the two lenses. Also, what if you have lenses with different cap sizes? The fastener isn't really easy to clip on and off.I wish I'd looked around more; I remember having a lens cap tether with an elastic band that went around the lens itself, and I think that would have been a better product.Still, it was a cheap lesson, thank goodness..."
2,"Nice idea, but severely limited in functionality.","I found this product to be rather difficult to use. It was my first lens-cap leash and I don't like it.The plastic attachment strap really restricts the type of lenses that can be put on your camera as it cannot be easily removed. Also, even on a shot lens, this leash is barely able to reach to the front of the lens. If I switch lenses, the cap is useless, unless the new lens is of the same sice diameter.I sentenced this lens-cap leash to be with my old 35mm Minolta 600si, which I rarely ever use now, thanks to the digital age. ;)I recommend the other lens-cap leashes with the elastic strap, for they work so much better."
3,Damaged goods...,"I first received this stock pot in Oct. I noticed it had a dent towards the bottom. I packed it up and shipped it back. Low and behold, I received another one in return. Upon close inspection, I realized it was the same pot, only someone had hammered out the dent. I asked for a replacement, not a repair. Amazon has gone to the dogs!"
1,Not impressed,"I made the popcorn with the butter and the mix. I avoid using butter on all foods for the pure fat content. I thought the butter packet was actually some type of caramel or sweet flavoring - but it was just butter. I used less than 1/2 of the butter packet after realizing it was not a flavoring and chucked the rest int he trash. The other packet tasted like seaweed and rice snacks. I tried it, won't try it again. Not impressed with the flavor, calories, or the snack in general."
4,I have had no problems with the cradle,I dont know why there is so much neg. feedback. I find the cradle easy to use. yes it does lack the AC power but I charge my cassiopeia every night and have no problems.
4,Greater starter camcorder,"This camcorder is very affordable and easy to use for beginners. My husband has always strayed from ""technology"" but can use this camera easily. I like that the camera has many options (fading in/out, titles, dates etc.)that make using the camera a little more challenging (and fun) for me. You can definately afford this camcorder! My only concern: the viewfinder seems to put the pictures in a yellowish tint and it is distracting."
2,Overrated....,"I love ECW but I don't love this event.PPV Name- ECW Heatwave 98Date - 8/2/98Buyrate - 0.25Attendence - 4,370City - Dayton, OhioArena - Hara ArenaJustin Credible over Jerry LynnChris Candido over Lance StormMike Awesome lost to Masato TanakaRob Van Damn/Sabu over Hayabusa/HakushiTaz over Bam Bam BigelowTommy Dreamer, Sandman, and Spike Dudley over Dudley Boys"
4,A review of the actual video!,"A lot of reviewers have missed out on a few things that should be told to anyone thinking of purchasing this tape.As an ECW fan, this was one of their best shows ever. I have seen every ECW pay-per-view, except for a few. This is not the official pay-per-view version and a few things have been cut, due to copyright problems and other reasons.Make no mistake, every match on here was classic and if I was ever going to show a non-ECW fan an event in hopes of getting them to enjoy, this would more than likely be in the top 5. However, I was slightly dissapointed by the fact that a number of things were cut included a pretty good entrance by Taz."
5,THIS DVD IS FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IF you love the old ECW this dvd is for you. all the matches are good from start to finish.I believe this has to be the best pay per view ECW ever did. buy and watch it yourself.
3,Carl Weathersbys performance is the high point of this CD,"Carl Weathersby is featured on several tracks, which make this CD worth having. carlweathersby.org"
3,Labels - Pure & Very Simple,"Good product, they work very well in an InkJet and a LaserJet printer. If you are looking for a really professional look spend the money and get the ""glossy"" finish. The ""matte"" finish is good for basic data disks."
4,These are good labels,"These labels are nice and thick, and both inkjet and laser printers print very well on them (no bleeding or flaking). If you have dark writing on the face of your CD, you will still be able to see it through the label, though, which is kind of annoying."
3,Nothing but labels.,"This is not a very special product. The CD labels you receive are way to thick, making printing look real paper-ish. They do stick to CD's very well though. THe address labels on each sheet are a pretty dumb extra though. You will never find yourself using them. I mean come on, are these not CD labels. Go get some cheap labels, do not waste your money on these. At least find something besides Neato."
3,I was expecting the kit,"I wasn't aware when I ordered this that I would also need more and should have ordered the kit.As far as the label material and the way it looks after printing onto the label, it looks great....but wish I would have know to order the whole kit."
1,Wow.,"This is possibly the worst cd ever created. The music is terrible and could have easily come off of a blink 182 cd. It sounds like every other crappy pop-punk band, except for the lyrics. Blink 182 is Shakespear compared to this garbage. It's like it was taken directly from some 15 year old's diary. Actually, make that a 15 year old with ADD.""I met a girl named TaraShe lived in the heart of AmericaShe liked black caddiesListened to Puff Daddy""How intriguing! How incredibly profound! This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life. At least they're good at rhyming... even if you know, it sounds completely idiotic. And after that brilliant stanza, it actually gets WORSE somehow.Maybe they could have careers as rappers, since obviously they have no talent as musicians."
4,Definitaly,"i love FM statis they rock, i think that their message is really good they are so good i think that they are like Hawk Nelson, Christians who sing rock music without all the bad words. you should definitaly get this cd"
3,"FM Static ""What Are You Waiting For?""","""Three Days Later"" (3/5): A decent opener.""Crazy Mary"" (3/5): A classic punk pop song in the tradition of Good Charlotte and Simple Plan.""Something To Believe In"" (4/5): This is a fun sing along song.""Definitely Maybe"" (5/5): The first real good song on the album.""Donna"" (3/5): A real catchy tune.""All The Days"" (3/5): Not a bad track, just not that great.""How Me Twice"" (2/5): This song is just way too poppy for me.""The Notion"" (3/5): A tune with a really catchy chorus.""October"" (3/5): The first song with some decent guitar parts.""My First Stereo"" (3/5): A good closing track to a decent album.FM Stereo's debut, ""What Are You Waiting For?,"" is textbook pop punk. If this is your style of music, it's not a horrible album. Some of the songs are a bit too poppy for my taste, but it is definately a fun cd to listen to. Not amazing, but definitely fun to check out.Rating: Three stars."
4,fantastic sound...not fantastic lyrics,"If this cd had better lyrics, i would no doubtedly give it five stars. Most of the time, they just sing about girls and relationships. I mostly like bands that not only have good sound, but good lyrics too. Truly, you wouldn't know this band were Christian unless you read SOME of the lyrics or label. None of the songs are bad at all. Trevor has a mind-blowing vocal ability. And when he wants to, he can write awesome songs. CRAZY MARY is pretty much the only song that sends a good message: don't judge a book by its cover. Also, the other disappointment the songs are too short (each is less than three minutes long). Well, overall, this is a good cd. Buy it."
3,A Fun Listen but May be Better to Buy Just the Songs You Like,"My sister had downloaded this CD and said she thought I would enjoy it as well. I have it now and have listened through it several times. It is a fun listen but there are only a few songs that I would want to listen to more than once.I really liked Stereo 1 and Donna, they have entertaining lyrics and a good sound. The remaining songs do come across a bit repetitive and the music choices are not as interesting. The band is very talented though. If you listen close each song seems to almost sample a bit from some very popular songs. This holds up my feeling that these young artists are focusing on the world around them and quoting it.As noted in the title, I would purchase the individual songs you like off a reputable sight if you only like 1 or 2. If you like more than that then get the whole CD!"
3,Definitely a maybe~,"I love this CD! I don't actually own it, but I have friends that do and I've heard it on their website. Trevor McNevan has an amazing voice, but the songwriting could use a little work. If you like Hawk Nelson, I definitely recommend this CD. My personal favorite songs on this CD were ""My First Stereo"", ""Crazy Mary"", ""Definitely Maybe"", & ""Something to Believe In"". Some of the songs like ""Donna"" and ""Notion"" were a little boring to me, but it could just be that I'm not the world's biggest punk-pop fan.It's true they had little references to God, but they didn't have anything Christians shouldn't be listening to either. I have no problem with them talking about Harry Potter. However, if it's any comfort to any of you, it wasn't the singer that was going to see Harry Potter in ""Definitely Maybe"", it was the girl he had a crush on and her shady boyfriend. So maybe her boyfriend forced her to go to it since he's evil and stuff lol."
3,its good,"this cd is pretty good.... and for all u christians out there who freak out because they mention harry potter in the one song, u need to get over urselves. i mean come on, im christian and i think that harry potter is the most amazing books ever written in the whole entire world. ummmm, maybe if u would stop being so judgemental and just read the books u would realize how amazing they r. u cant tell me that the whole idea of the books r just completely wonderful."
1,true to it's name,This stuff [is bad]!As far as I'm concerned fm STATIC is true to it's name. I can't believe members from TFK would do such a thing this is the worst cd that I've ever heard!!!!! Do not buy this cd.The only song that might even qualify as decent is the first track (three day's later[i kinda like this song]) and that isn't even very good considering that it features members from the always original band TFK (I'm thier biggest fan) I'm disgusted that they would actually put thier names on this.I went to see them on the Kutless tour and they were even worse there than on the cd like I said (especially TFK fans) DO NOT BUY THIS CD[!]
3,This is a CHRISTIAN album?,"I honestly cannot believe this band calls themselves Christian. A lot of guys said the songs about girls (9 out of 11, I belive, as has been stated) got old really quickly, but as a girl, I got tired of them the first time I heard them. It's obvious that the lyrics are terrible. I only give the CD 3 stars because I like the music itself. If you can overlook lyrics about shady boyfriends, Donna, Tara, and Mary, more power to you, but there are much better ways to spend your money. The lyrics are clean, but not God-centered. The 2 songs that aren't about girls are about a stereo with oddly human qualities (""always accepts me, never rejects me"") and searching for religion. That song doesn't even make sense, as they claimed to be Christian already. All in all, I'm glad I borrowed it instead of buying it. If you want a truly Christian CD, look elsewhere, but if you like this style of music, who's stopping you?"
4,Good pop punk cd,"Not a bad first effort from the lead singer of Thousand Foot Krutch. Some good pop punk riffs, and catchy sing-along lyrics to boot. A nice short cd to get your energy going. <:)"
4,It's not bad...musically,"The music and rhythms are so catchy and have such a high replay value that it completely blankets the fact that the lyrics are retarded. And I guess (according to a previous review) that it is an accurate reflection of a Christian teen. Well, in that case Christian teens go around calling cheating jerks pylons and hang out with alcoholic slow girls. Music is good, lyrics are stupid; it's pop so it doesn't matter anyway. Buy it."
5,One of the Best Manga Ever!!,"Book number 4 is the best in the series(so far)! There's a lot of emotion between Alice and Kyo, as well as Alice and Frei. The story moves along at a faster pace than the others, but it still keeps you an the edge of your seat, dieing of anticipation of what will come next. But be warned, there is some hentai in this volume. Mayura is found by other Mram Masters and is made their leader. Alice and Kyo also accept their responsibility as Neo-Masters of the Lotis. You also get to see a serious side of love in Frei toward Alice!(It's so cute!!)>.< The artwork by Watase is as good as ever and she leaves you waiting for for the next volume to come out, and you want it so badly, that you would kill to get it. *giggles*"
2,Missing minutes,"This really was a good film when it first came out. Itcould also have been a good film as a DVD release. Butit falls short. The reason is that this edition is missingapproximately 20 minutes from the theatrical release. Ifyou watch the credits, you will see the names of stars whodo not appear in this film. Also, part of the reasoningbehind Valdez leaving his days behind as a peaceful man,and returning to his glory days as a sharpshooter and scoutare largely lost in the missing minutes. It is a jumpy filmthat seems uneven due to the missing minutes. There is noreason why the film should hsve been cut, but it was. Andas a result is a butchered film. I would not waste money onit again."
1,MGM blew it,"I think the publication of this VERSION of ""Valdez Is Coming"" is a travesty.The version published by MGM is NOT the original version. It is MISSING over 20 minutes of the original film. AND nowhere can I find a caveat advising potential purchasers of this film concerning this abominable editing.I have previously stated this opinion on the phone. WHY does AMAZON continue to PEDDLE a bastarized version?Repeat, repeat and re-peat. Isn't there a law against this sort of insidious editing of the work of a performer- Burt Lancaster, in this case?BAD BAD BADDON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING"
4,They pushed him too far...,"An atypical western, with the always-excellent Burt Lancaster giving a nicely understated performance as aging Mexican constable Bob Valdez, whose persistence in seeking recompense for a penniless widow gets him into trouble with a ruthless land baron. After some very nasty treatment, he digs out his old personna and sends the warning that is the film's title. Nice supporting cast contributes much. Many fine scenes and memorable lines, along with rugged location filming, help to lift this movie into the higher grade of western. Highly recommended."
3,Why do they have to cheat us=cuts!,"Is it MGM/UA or someone else, I'm 55 years old & also have seen all the great Burt Lancaster westerns Valdez/Lawman & I also love the great Michael Winner films. Does anyone know the answer to this-why are we being raped Off?!!! All are still great films,but I'm not buying.(I don't like being raped-off!!!Valdez is Coming"
3,Did you miss the performance of Jon Cypher?,"As you may have already read, this DVD is deeply cut and some of the fonder scenes missing. However, the storyline moves along. Great performances by all. Jon Cypher stole the show. Great flick, I bought 2, one to keep and one to loan."
4,"Great Burt Lancaster movie, classic revenge story","Burt Lancaster is small town ""has been"" sheriff who doesn't even use a gun. Once was a great gunfighter year's ago. He is scorned by a cattle barron when he tries to get a small money award for a poor mexican widow.When he asks again he is beaten and left to die in the desert. He makes it back to civilization, opens the old trunk with his gunfighter duds and old buffalo hunting gun, and the fun begins.GREAT ending!!!! If you get into stories of the little guy or the old guy triumphing over powerful men used to getting their own way, this one's worth a watch."
3,so so,"ok book- it was sort of flimsy and too short, but for the price it was fine. overall, a decent purchase."
2,It is a waste of time,"If you're serious about getting impressive scores, then look elsewhere. This book was really a waste of time. Although ""Cracking the GRE"" is the best GRE book, ""Cracking the TOEFL"" is not as good."
1,a very skimpy book,"The first third of this book is the catalog of violations. It consists of poor, grainy, black and white pictures that often don't show what they purport to (one picture taken from 8 feet away from a small 4"" electrical box has a caption ""cover is held on with only one screw""...heck, I can barely see the *box*!). Each violation example has 2/3 of the page left blank for ""notes"". What notes, exactly, should one take here? ""poor picture""?Despite the subtitle, nothing in the book explains ""how to recognize"" violations.The latter 2/3 of the book is just reprints of OSHA, etc. documents, which are available free or cheaply from various government agencies.A major let down."
5,Great Information to use in the field!,"This book opened my eyes to how many Violations are out there, I now look for and find violations in everyday situations just about everywere I go.I would recomend this book to anyone, interested in Code."
2,Not for me..,"I purchased this product after being very pleased with NeoStrata's AHA face wash, but this was too much for my skin. IT was not irritating, but it did dry my skin out. I won't be purchasing this again. This is not the best product if you have dry or combination skin (as I do) but would probably be okay if your skin is on the oily side."
1,Cartridge Leaked and Left Streaks on Paper,"My company ordered four cartridges (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, and Black). The black cartridge was the first to be replaced in our printer. After we opened the package, we noticed that the cartridge was old and had been used before. There was yellow toner on the outside of the cartridge and the black label that designates what color of toner is in it was peeling off, revealing a yellow label underneath it. We decided to try it out and immediately started seeing black streaks on our prints. When we opened the printer to look at the cartridge we noticed that black toner had spilled out and onto the inside of the printer. When we took the black toner cartridge out of the printer, black toner started spilling out of the side of the cartridge. We will be sending this, as well as the other three cartridges back."
2,Cyan Cartridge did not work,Just put in the cyan cartridge and it does not work. How do I contact the distributor to get a replacement. My email is glharris154@gmail.com
5,Great belt or tie rack,Finally - a belt rack with enough well-designed hooks! Maybe my husband has a abundance of belts but they were eternally falling off other racks when he loaded 2 belts on each of the 5 or 6 hooks that were provided.This belt rack fits well across the back of a closet door and has deep hooks that easily hold the belts.Great product; highly recommended.
3,Fine for ties,"This is fine for ties, but belt buckles that are bulky and/or dont have moveable prong this becomes hard to hang up and keep stable."
5,"Cheap, functional.","I hung one up in my closet to help organize my small array of belts and ties. This was the perfect size, and it was trivial to mount and the pegs arent' coming loose like an older model I owned."
2,A Plain but Touching Memoir,"The author wandered from being nominally Catholic to a devout Jehovah's Witness to a super fundamentalist Baptist to Catholic again. Frankly, the writing is not exicting and the author's decisions will leave many readers mystified. Whole years are skipped so the narrative seems choppy. This sometimes confused journey of faith does have some touching moments. The main reason to buy the book and it's real strength is it's sober look at the inner workings of the JW sect."
5,Good buy,"I wasn't sure about ordering a nylon hand truck at first, but after using it I'm very happing with it. It feels just as rigid as my previous truck, which was very similar style to this one only made of steel tube. The only time i notice less strength is when going over uneven surfaces, there is a little more frame flex with the nylon. The real advantage for me is not worrying about it rusting like the steel truck."
4,Hmm,"We have well-water here and it calls for double the amount compared to ""city"" water. I would rec. you only use what it calls for, we have a queen size soft side pillow top waterbed and only used 4oz. So far so good (I think)"
4,Good quality stuff,"The bottles arrived promptly and well packaged. I just added it a few months ago. So far, the water quality seems good. I've used this product before and it's worked very well."
3,Waterbed Conditioner,I poured it in. What else can i say? I'll let you know in 9-12 monthsso i need more words for waterbed conditioner?
3,Good service,I don't have a way of testing how well this product works. Using it in hopes that it is doing what is says. I do appreciate receiving it quickly.
2,Came Up Short,This spark plug wire set was fine in material quality and general fit as far as an average set goes. I'm unsure if all the sets were packaged this way or some one was just having a bad day but one of the wires was very tight between the coil and plug and I had to stretch it to make it reach. All the other cables were fine but this one just didn't seem to go in the box with the others.
1,Not a great pie book,"When I ordered this book I had in mind a great pie book from the description of it and turned out to be a mega disapointment. It has only one picture of a completed recipe and that is the cover work. It has several bad traits to it, It is written completely in red type. It is very hard to read. It does not say what it should look like when completed. Not for people who are just starting baking. When we got the book we returned it right away for a refund. Do not waste your time with this book."
2,disappointed,"Wow. Looking for the best of this movie? Check out the cinematography...absolutely beautiful filming/locations! Hurts me to say, some of the worst acting I've ever seen."
1,WOW WHAT A BAD MOVIE,"The acting was horrible,it felt like you were on the movie set listening to the cast practice their lines. The crime, where was the crime? A large amount of time in the movie didn't connect to each other and precious screen time was wasted. This is a real sin in the movie industry. The acting, script, and directing gets a big zero. Almost any 44 minute TV program like CSI and Law And Order produces a better crime that holds your interest. I writing this review so other people don't waste their time and money on this B, way below B movie."
1,Just Bad,"The movie started ok, but continually fell apart. I found my self getting annoyed with some of the acting and the slow plot. Finally, we just stopped the movie because we couldn't watch it anymore."
2,Not bad...but feels a bit off.,"Started out ok, however it seems as if the viewer must assume there are relationships between characters beyond what is obvious. I think what bothered me the most was the female officer that plays a major part in the film. Her acting went from being very stern to very vunarable, with no reasoning other than a past relationship with the other female lead, that isn't made apparent. The chemistry between the two female leads left a lot to be desired. I definitely wouldn't recommend rushing to see this film, but if you have some time to kill and nothing better to do, then at the very least give it a chance."
1,do not waste your time,"YOu could almost see the women hold their breaths and man up before they kissed each other. Predictable, disjointed preachy. No flow between shots.Have they never heard of a segue? Hokey gimicks,did the lemonade have to change colour on the carpet was it not obvious enough? Oh and skinny lanky serial killer takes out the heavily muscled dude who conviently dies of a heart attack right after the final drama. He didn't fit in the picture .So bad it should be in one of those movie marathons for stinker flics. Not even lesbians would like this movie.Filmed poorly acted poorly written poorly. What a mess.."
2,Big Disappointment with calendar sync,"After Nokia I got spoiled with the easy calendar sync. This program is not friendly with Lotus Notes, especially where repeating calendar entries exist. It's too much trouble to use."
1,useless item,This doesn't help me transfer photos and movies from my phone to the computer.Not as I expected it to be.
1,Amazon's Item Description Lacking,"The CD was apparently intended for distribution outside of the U.S. (Actually China and Taiwan) and installation requires that the phone be UNlocked. Consequently, it is unusable with phones obtained from a specific provider. Those phones are ""locked"" into the protocols unique to that provider's service. This little bit of information was omitted from Amazon's product description.Unless you are sure that you have a phone that can be unlocked, don't buy this item."
1,Typical Motorola garbage,"I have tried all versions of Motorola Phone Tools from 2.0 up to 5.13B and have tried to run it on WindowsXP and Windows Vista I have tried to use it with various Motorola phones and if I remember correctly actually got it to work once a long time ago and don't even remember which phone it worked with. The problem is though, even when you get it to work it doesn't last. Eventually it just quits working. I wouldn't recommend this program to anyone. Another irritant I have with the program is everytime you install the program it has to update itself several times which takes hours on my connection and then doesn't save the update files so when you have to re-install it again and again to try despearately to get this expensive program to work you spend your whole day for nothing."
1,very poor product,this product was awful it crashed my pc i had to get it fixed twice thank god i only payed about three dollars but i had to pay more for my pc repair i will not buy again i do not recomend this product
1,Beware!,"All of the advertisement says works with Motorola phones. Advertisements do not specify any certian types, just Motorola phones. This does not work with iden phones ( i670 to be specific). Paid cheapo price. Not worth bothering with return. Will give to a friend or sell at flea market."
3,Don't Get The Update From Motorola,"I have new phones and I am trying to get the old pics off my old Motorola. I have a V-300 which is no longer supported by the Motorola website. If you have an older phone like this one and you are trying to download the pics to your computer, this software will work. However, when you install it, you will be prompted to download (separately) the drivers and the updates that are newer than version 4.0. Download the drivers. But, avoid the updates like the plague. I initially downloaded the updates and the software ended up giving me a message that said it no longer supported my old phone which was the same thing the website's software had said when I downloaded it previously. I then uninstalled the whole thing (drivers included) and rebooted. Then, I gave it one last shot and reinstalled everything except for the updates. It worked like a champ. I got everything off my old phone despite Motorola's backwards software that couldn't care less about you as a customer."
4,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software CD,"The CD was delivered in a very timely fashion. Easay to install, but some of the directions for the functions between program and phone are not clear. This must be a Motorola issue."
1,Not compatible with my phone,"I researched syncing items before purchasing motorola phone tools 4.0. I installed it on my computer but couldn't find my particular phone to upload so I could go through files, transfer picture etc. I needed another version of motorola but the item description stopped me from doing so, because it stated it was spcifically for my type, make model of phone.It wasn't. As of right now it's useless, I uninstalled the program."
2,Not compatible,After I got the product I found my phone was not compatible with this disk. Should have had better info from the phone company.Not your fault.
1,rhino engineer,"Product will not work, my granddaughter was very, very disappointed!We spent approximately 5 hrs trying to download pics from my cell phone!Motorola is not a good company to purchase items from, I will never purchase any item made by Motorola again. This software disc is trash, it does not work!"
1,Not what I needed,I was hoping to use this produt to download the pictures from my RAZR V3 to my PC and it didn't work
3,"Once you can get installed, it's good.","It is a good product once you figure out how to install it. It took me forever to install it and get it working with my phone. Once I did figure it out, it was great."
3,Wonderfully Good,This product is good. I used it on my Windows Xp SP1 computer and it let me connect to the web using my cellphone via GPRS Cingular. It also is fun t o use the multimedia software. Onlyu problems is sometimes my comp dont recognize modem (rarely )Jesus Rules
3,motorolla phone tools review,"I got the phone tools to try and back-up my phone numbers, should anything happen to it. I was able to save the numbers(i think) but couldn't download my pictures or anything, so just be aware, it may not have as much functionality for you phone as you might want. The price was right though."
5,"Make your own ringtones, etc.","This product allows you to transfer files of all sorts between your phone and computer. In addition, you can charge your phone through the USB port and sync it with Outlook. I made my own ringtones using music on a CD. I only wish Motorola would haveincluded this with their phone."
1,Won't finish installing,"After loading the program, it goes into a setup mode which hangs. I spent hours uninstalling, rebooting the computer, then reinstalling it to no effect. I tried stopping Norton Anti-virus first, but that didn't help. This is the basic version of the program. The full version costs an additional $59.95."
4,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software CD (no Cables included) for Motorola Model Phones
4,Motorola Phone Tools Review,This software did exactly what I wanted by allowing me to extract a bunch of pictures on my phone at once and put them on my computer. Very easy to install and worked the first time.
1,Not what I had ordered!!!,I had placed an order for the Motorola Phone Tools 4.0. I recieved this generic software that does not even resemble the software I was looking for. Not worth the time or the effort to make an issue. Probably what they were hopping for?
1,Don't buy this if you have a Verizon phone,"If you have a Verizon phone the only thing this, or any other Motorola software, can do is back up your contacts to your computer; ALL other functions are blocked by Verizon; as I found out later. For backing up contacts I would recommend using the Verizon backup assistant that you can download to your phone, even old ones, for free. (It will say the cost is $1.99 but with the online ""My Verizon"" they will remove the charge). I bought this without any research because it was a few bucks so it was a bigger waste of time than money."
1,WRONG PRODUCT,I was misinformed of this product. It is not compatible with the equipment that I have. I required MPT.V.5.0.7a. All the while I was inquiring the MPT program for a Motorola phone W755 and everyone was telling me that this program would work. WRONG. A waste of time and money. Seriousley doubt that I will use this service again!
2,Phone tools,"I couldn't get phone tools to really do anything for my krazr. Kind of a waste of money, but maybe I just didn't know how to really use the program. I have a new phone now and tend to lean away from motorola phones."
4,motorola software,Great value. It did everything that it said it would do and with the cost of $5 for the product and shipping it was worth it. Works with the two motorola model phones I have.
5,Lesbian gothic thriller,"Mary Wings is the author of the witty and entertaining Emma Victor series. With Divine Victim, Wings achieves higher and succeds. It is a dark, haunting story that links, surprisingly, lesbianism and the Roman Catholic faith. Other components of the story include art, art history and cloistered life.The narrator's girlfriend Maryam inherits a house and a considerable fortune from her aunt Rebecca, on the condition that she has to live in the house one year. In Rebecca's house the narrator comes accross strange objects such as a nun's habit and a box full of red human hair. She become's interested in Rebecca's life and the secret that her house seams to hide. Meanwhile, someone is after the narrator, and it is not only the traumatic memories from her past, of her former lover Ilona and of their nightmarish trip to Italy."
5,ECW,"What can I say? With the WWF the only company left, it seems we can only look to ECW DVDs to remember why we liked wrestling in the first place. Don't expect to see people dancing around the ring with their pants down, people's eyebrows or 3 minute matches. This is wrestling. NOT sports entertainment."
4,a good vhs but the dvd would hav been better,"i bought this tape on vhs cause i thought it had the 2 matches i mostly wanted 2 c which was the sandman vs cactus jack & rvd vs sabu but they aint on the vhs version so i was a little dissapoined but not 2 say the vhs wasnt a good video ,its full of hardcore ecw matches from 1995-96 & all the matches r good but i should hav bought the dvd version overall its a good way 2 remember wot ecw was like in its early dayz so buy it now!"
1,An artistic abomination.,"The sounds of the German language play as important a role in this music as the notes themselves, and I cannot believe that anyone would waste time performing this in English. Moreover, this is the clumsiest, most unsingable English translation I've ever come across.Thank God, beautiful recordings of this work are available -- for example, Anne Sophie von Otter's rendition, which is stunning. Marianne Faithfull should not be singing, let alone recording her work for all to hear. Avoid this recording at all costs."
3,Hugo Rocks,"I was given this CD as a ""white elephant"" gift, and it turned out to be one of the rare surprises in life that I can count. Although not familiar with Miss Faithful's previous work, I was delighted to hear the choices of artists accompanying her. Track 5 is definitely a fun sound, and made more so by the melodic harmony of an angelic Hugo Munday. One for the treasure trove of items to pass to the kids!"
3,Mixed feelings,"Yes, she offers an interesting interpretation, although this version is somewhat of an oddity for me, having become familiar with the various original language versions available. If you're a fan of Faithful already, then by all means. My felling is that reading the libretto and translation (if necessary) ahead of time is not such a big deal. Brecht is highly nuanced German, after all, and this work is extremely interesting as literature alone. If you're looking for a definitive version of the work, don't even think about this one. I suggest those seriously interested in the work try three others: 1) Lotte Lenya, of course, 2) Gisela May, maybe even more *perfect* and 3) Brigitte Fassbaender, for a deeply felt and vocally magnificent take."
4,Faithfull does it again!,"Wonderful recording of a wonderful piece of music, with a wonderful singer. An excellent follow-up to her previous work. Very recommended."
1,No cigar,"This is at best an interesting curiosity for the collector's library. Perhaps it was courageous for Faithfull to compete in an arena so dominated by one singer. But compared with the Lotte Lenya version (ASIN B000002991), her rendition sounds both mechanical and lugubrious."
4,Shor's Criticisms are Unfounded,"Shor's negative Library Journal review of this book cannot be taken seriously. A conventional vet, Shor obviously has a vested interest in dog owners not empowering themselves with a holistic approach to care. His criticisms are unfounded. Nux vomica, which Shor fearfully labels as strychinine is a homeopathic remedy that contains no measurable amount of the poison. His reluctance to feed dogs raw meat ignores the fact that dogs in nature consume raw meat, including carrion, bacteria and all. Let's not even consider what goes into most commercial dog foods. His final example of a contradictory statement concerning not bathing dogs yet allowing them to swim doesn't point out a contradiction at all: the last time I checked, dogs swim in water while they are bathed with water plus soap and/or chemicals that strip their hair of its natural oils."
5,Wonderful overview of holistic care for dogs!,"As the proud owner of a fourteen year old poodle named Murphy and a roaming tom-cat named Spencer, I appreciate a book with a holistic approach toward animal care. As with all older pets, my dog Murphy has experienced his fair share of medical problems and I don't like inundating him with prescription medication on a regular basis. The Natural Dog gives me a variety of natural and safe ways to treat Murphy's ailments, and provides methods to keep him healthy! This book is informative and entertaining, providing pet owners with an A-Z guide on common dog problems and their natural solutions. The Natural Dog will assist anyone who wishes to become acquainted with holistic medicine for pets."
2,"Henry Kidd, Outlaw","""Henry Kidd, Outlaw"" is the sixth Western novel by Will Cade. Marsh Perkins from North Carolina is out to find and kill a man who murdered his father. He has traveled to Texas to avenge his father's death by killing Henry Kidd. Kidd is a truly diabolical man who murders innocent people and then mutilates them. The reader finds out that Henry Kidd is a simple-minded, gentle person. It is his brother, Starky, who is the killer. Starky is willing to let innocent Henry take the blame for the murders. Will Marsh be able to kill Kidd or will Kidd get away? Will Cade has written some excellent Westerns like ""The Gallowsman"", ""Genesis Rider"", and ""Stalker's Creek"", but this novel has little plot and virtually no Western ""flavor"" that the other novels by Will Cade have. This was the first Western by Cade that I did not enjoy. Hopefully he will return to form with his next novel."
5,Staying power,"This has been one of my favorite albums for the last 15 years! I don't know anyone who's grown sick of it, everyone I've played it for liked it, and it remains one of my most listened to albums after all these years."
3,It's ok,"This book offers many recipes that are easy to make, however, some are very strange and the recipes seem like they are from the 70's. Nothing wrong with that except if you are looking to impress some of your guests with more contemporary items."
3,Ok...,"I found this cookbook at a friends house and searched the internet for it. It's ok...It's more for beginner cooks. I'm starting to like more complicated recipes, so this isn't really useful to me anymore. I've made some of the dishes and they aren't great unless you doctor them up."
3,5 ingredient cookbook,"The cookbook pages were very good however the back part of the book cover was crinkled and had some spots on it, like moisture had gotten to it. Delivery was not as fast as I hoped it would be."
3,"Not ""Like New""","The book arrived as scheduled. The disappointment was that the book was described as ""used - like new"" When it arrived the cover had dried food on it, the corners of the covers were bent, and there was other wear on the cover. There was one page that had a folded down corner but no writing on the pages. Not ""like new""."
4,Interesting world rock music - Native artist,"Filed sometimes under New Age Music but actually would consider this World Music. Pretty good, am surprised that more people have not caught on. This native award winning band is a multicultural asset.Intersting and unique- various slower harmonic/fast paced rock includes drums, flute, guitar, piano in modern and pulsating arrangement, some tracks peaceful and serene. Mainly instrumental with vocal enhancement. Give it a try.. it will take you to another land."
3,Interesting blend of Native American and electronica,"This was an OK album. I got it because I expected more Native American sounds, rather it is mostly electronica with a Native American theme. I don't have a problem with Brule doing this kind of music, it just doesn't appeal to me."
3,Slow start but interesting to the end,"Slow starting off but if the subjects (China, military history, adventure) interest you it is worth sticking to it. The pace of the writing picks up after a bit and the last 2/3 are enjoyable. I do wish there had been more historical pictures and maps."
3,An interesting and rich account from Asian history,What an interesting story. History is full of now obscure individuals who have achieved far more than we can imagine. Ward is an inspiration to those who believe in adventure and still hold to their principles. Well done.
1,Is this the same writer who penned 'The Alientist'?,"I bought Caleb Carr's ""The Devil Soldier"" because I was interested in what his writing was like before he wrote The Alienist (which I thought was great). What a disappointment. The writing isn't nearly as descriptive or exciting as that in The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness. I understand that this is historical non-fiction, but I've read textbooks that were far more exciting. I guess I should be grateful for whatever turned Carr's writing around, whether it be his editor or whether he was able to make the changes on his own. Whatever the reason, it's a good thing his style did change. To sum it up, The Alienist is one of my favorite books of the last few years, and The Devil Soldier is definitely one of the most forgettable that I've read. Don't waste your time."
3,"For people interested in that part of history, good source.","I read the book because of my interest in history. I'm Chinese from Taiwan, recognizing Ward and ""Ever Victorious Army"" from text book. The book certainly is well researched and written, however, it will not be for general consumption. The writer tried very hard to elevate Ward's importance, such as the sub-title ""The American became a God..."" which he explained later ""more like a saint"". Ward did not become a God. Chinese respect deceased in general, it may appear to Westerner as worship, THEN and NOW. It is not right to down play his role, but at the same time, don't do the opposite. The idea of training Chinese soliders was a logical move, Ward was there and he did it first. However, to say his existence impacted modern China, will be self-serving. Read it as a page of interesting history if you're interested. By the way, Ward's standard was upside down in the picture insert. Just compare it with the cover picture on the lower part."
2,Measure your Dumbbells,"No problem setting it up but I was really disappointed when many of my dumbbells would not fit. If they don't have a 5"" handle, they end up on the floor. I am too lazy to undo the thing to send it back."
4,Very solid and attractive dumbell rack,"Ordered this to keep my increasing collection of hex dumbells organized. It shipped quickly, and was well packed on arrival.I have no idea what other reviewers mean by hard to assemble - even without instructions (which were provided) it was super simple. (You do need two wrenches for the bolts and the nylock nuts) If you cannot figure out how to assemble this, then you have no business lifting heavy objects without adult supervision!It is attractively finished, and stores my 6 sets of 'bells, from 10lb to 35lb with ease. It is very stable, and keeps the dumbells well organized and easy to access.The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was I think the cut-outs where the dumbells sit on the rack could do with a rubber lining, both to make putting them down quieter, and to prevent scratching. But that is a very minor peeve. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent Value,Excellent Value. Easy to assemble and takes up a small footprint on floor. Very sturdy with 6 pairs of dumbbells racked from 5 to 30 lbs.
5,~,"I'm not an avid anime fan, but my friend is. She drags me to watch all her droning anime series, most of which did not enthrall me. However, when she introduced a more-than-skeptical me to FY...consider me bewitched. Absolutely! This anime contains all the elements of a deftly crafted series. No movie, TV show, or other such had engaged me as much Fushigi Yuugi. I've never been so emotionally connected to any other show. The plot and characters are chiseled with such precision...and each episode very effectively beguiles you to watch the next. It's inspiring...every minute is a breath of fantasy... it's as if you're living in an epic."
4,A rather addictive movie,"I first saw this series at college, and I just could not get enough of it, and that was the subtitled version, even people who said that they dont like anime were drawn to this series, a must have if you want to introduce anime to new people"
2,Disappointed!,Waited several months for this film only to find out it was not the full version; i.e. it is censored from the original French version. VERY DISAPPOINTED! It would seem fair to expect that information to be disclosed beforehand.
2,Disappointed w Censored product,"While I enjoyed the film overall the fact that this has been censored from original French version is extremely disappointing. I am assuming that Amazon did not do it, but do not know why French producers would do so. Be careful when buying that you get original French film ""Q"" when purchasing."
1,desire,"not worth buying. another disappointing venture in North American censorship just to get a movie released. i wish America would grow up and accept films that depict real life and real sex. honestly i'm shocked the french sold out just to get their movie released but money rules. anyway, if you're looking for the uncut version, this is not it."
1,Censored version.,I should waited for some reviews before ordering this. I threw this into the garbage because everytime I saw the box cover in my collection it reminded me of wasted $$$.
3,Censored,It should be noted that this is a somewhat censored version of what turns out to be a very mediocre and disappointing film
2,Wrong advertising,"I preordered this DVD a few months ago and just got it in the mail. It is advertised as unrated version, but clearly is a rated version. I have seen scenes of the unrated movie elsewhere and the DVD does not contain these. Don't buy this DVD. I will return mine today. Too bad, because it seems to be a great movie, but clearly looses with the scenes cut out."
1,don't waste ur $ on this DVD,"Don't waste ur $ on this DVD. It's not worth to buy cos they deleted all the male frontal nudity scene! Its not ""unrated"" at all!"
1,"""That doesn't work""","A classic example of rushing a product to market before it's ready. It freezes my G4 if I try to start it with the dock plugged in, and gives me an erroneous power warning otherwise. And my 8-series HP printer will only work with an out-dated 6-series driver. I explained all this to tech support, and the reply was, ""Oh yeah, that doesn't work."" They're supposedly working on a fix that was supposed to be ready a month ago. When will computer companies learn to fix products before they sell them?"
1,Controller,"I have an Entrega mac4U hub that is still in warranty and has been a source of lots of trouble...freezes, etc. When I first got it I wrote Entrega about the problems and they advised me to write ...apparently Entrega wanted this address to reply. I wrote them several times...they never answered my mail.I have no idea who they are and what their connection with Entrega is. This hub is completely unreliable when used with an I MAc and Entrega never made an attempt to make it right. I paid 129.95 for it but will never buy their product again. If anyone knows how to contact entrega (if in business) please let me know. Totally dissatisfird with their product."
2,B train ride,"Rail Kings revolves around the quest by a rich man's feckless son suspected of the murder of his parents. He avoids the murder charge by riding freight trains in search of the hobo he suspects of being the real murderer. He experiences the lifestyle and company of the various hobo jungles, love interest, robbery and an unexpected twist in the tale along the way. Good box car scenery apart, this is a B movie special rather than an A train ride, with no name actors apart from a cameo appearance by Ernest Borgine of the incomparable hobo movie `Emperor of the North'. There are grounds here for a more engaging road/train to personal redemption movie to break out, beyond its otherwise base banality and obscure direction. I watched Rail Kings on U Tube, so I can't comment on the DVD format. Its watchable but forgettable"
4,Nice product,I would have given it a 5 star. Took off 1 star because my fish died before the replacement filter arrived. Shipment should be a little quicker. For the price it should have had the lid closure
4,Helps you to think more clinically,"I bought this book because I heard it would be a good review for the shelf. I haven't taken it yet, but I've found it to be quite useful in helping me answer USMLE world questions. What I have found to be most helpful is that it presents a core clinical vignette, and then asks you what you would do if the patient presented with various additional problems. I feel it helps to remind me how different each patient can be and understand the diversity in care options based on those differences. For a similar style book, Surgical Attending Rounds is also very good."
3,"Ok, but that is it...","There are better books out there for reviewing surgery, but I read this one (as one of several) and performed well. So, I can't say I wouldn't recommend it. Just not one of my favorites. I also liked First Aid and the abdomen section of Step Up. Remember the shelf is written with an internal medicine slant."
1,Rude Factory service and lack of information,"I shopped for the machine locally and had a courteous service person call the factory for the information I requested, since they didn't have it in stock.While I waited, he was connected with three different people; he reported how each was abrupt and rude. Finally the person who was in charge answered with a recording saying he would be unavailable for two weeks and to leave a message. Thelocal salesperson apologized in their behalf repeatedly.Needless to say, I won't be buying this machine."
1,"Good flow, but it would kill you fish","Very true, it will kill your fish. Dont buy this power head, the suction part is poorly designed that will suck your fish. Yesterday I found two of my fishes death in the suction cone. Dont get this power head unless you are using a under gravel filter."
4,"If you loved the last one, you'll love this one.","THis is not as good as Mario. Mario seems to spank everyone in this area due to two major factors. The levels and action is very creative, and the graphics are fun. Now, that said. Pac-Man World 3 is way good. It is not as creative or pretty as Mario but it is close on both accounts. The controls handle very well. And they have even thrown in a bit of old school pac-man emulation. There are over 14 levels in this game, most of which will engage you. If you loved the last pac man world game. You will love this one. This is more of the same which is fine by me."
4,Fun Game,Overall I like this game because I love PacMan. My biggest complaint is that the graphics spin you around a lot and it makes me dizzy just watching it so I haven't gotten very far in the game.
2,Noisy little buzzer with flimsy attachments,"I bought this little clipper to clean up my Yorkie's paws after reading the positive reviews here. My dog is fine with other cordless Wahl clippers, but this unit makes a lot more noise, and neither ones of us likes the irritating buzzing it makes. The basic clipper seems pretty well made for the low price, but the plastic guard attachment that controls the depth of cut is flimsy and hard to adjust. Three other comb attachments come with the unit, but the instructions fail to hint how these are to be attached and they're too delicate for much trial and error. All in all, I wish I had applied the price of this unit to one of the better, higher-end, rechargeable Wahl clippers."
1,Didn't work...very disappointed,"I was really looking forward to receiving this trimmer to help trim my cat's backside, but I could not get the trimmer to turn on. I tried 2 sets of batteries (thinking the batteries that came with it were just old), but new batteries didn't work either. :-( I'm debating whether or not to order another one, in the hopes that I just got a defective one...i will update my review if I try a new one and it works."
4,Works well,I have 5 Westies and this trimmer does the trick for touch-ups. Very convenient and works for the those sensitive spots around the neck and face.
5,Mini-trimmer,"The trimmer makes it easier to tidy up around and in between the toes of any size dog. ""Wahl 9990-502 Touch Up Pet Trimmer"""
3,Clippers,I needed clippers to trim hair from the bottom of my Briard's paws. These clippers just don't get it done with one pass.
3,"Good, Solid Rock Music","This CD has three songs on it that I like. The first, and foremost, is the song entitled ""Invade My Soul."" For some reason this song just speaks to my heart that we need to let God invade all the barriers we put up against Him so that He can take control. Let us do that: allow God to work through us, and not around us. Overall, this CD is not one of my favorites but it still has a good Christian message to it."
2,Boring and predictable,"There had to be something more deserving of the 2001 ""Best Modern Rock Album"" Dove Award than this. The band sounds like a knockoff of Vertical Horizon or some equally forgettable alt-rock band but without mustering even 1 tune as eminently catchy as ""Everything You Want"". No interesting musical or lyrical twists and turns. There were only a couple tracks I found to be ""acceptable"" and these aren't good enough to stick in my memory when the disc is out of the player.BOTTOM LINE:No no no no no. Spend your money on something else. The Choir..Daniel Amos...Benjamin Gate. Just not this one."
2,About Average,"I ordered this reed and started playing it, but to my distaste, it was too wide to give proper pitch or a comfortable playing experience, while it functions well as a reed, it does not have the same quality as other reeds that I have purchased."
2,Performance issues,"The concept of fake security cameras with blinking leds and motion is a good idea. I had to return the first unit, because the motion detector would not work. Second unit doesn't always move when motion occurs. Wife did not like the look of the unit. On the second unit, one of the phillips screw's head was deformed and I could not use the screw. I may have to return the second unit. That's says it all. Try the more expensive fakes."
3,Rock around the Apocalypse,"Now, the idea of a rockabilly/martial arts/postapocalyptic flick done on a shoestring may sound like the result of mixing medications, but in this case, it works! Six String Samurai's tale of Buddy and his quest to take Elvis's throne as the new King of Lost Vegas - the last cradle of American 'civilization' - has a few slow parts, but is generally pretty entertaining. The fights are good (mercifully bereft of 'wire fu') and the idea is realized pretty well. Russkie rockabilly group the Red Elvises do some of their best work in the soundtrack, and the guitar battle between rockabilly and heavy metal is a pretty cool symbolic showdown. I only gave it three stars for the occasional slow parts, and all in all, I would buy it again."
1,Not worth the time it takes to read this review,"If you're an adolescent boy who has seen about 5 movies in your limited life (three of them being Mad Max films), or if you really get off on awful, low-budget cinema along the lines of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" then you'll probably enjoy this perfectly wretched execution of a perfectly brilliant premise. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,About the service,"I ordered this Item, it was sent twice through DHL Global mail and... I never received it"
1,"CRAPPY FILM, GOOD MUSIC","If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and don't! I rented it @ my local indie video store thinking it might be a cool watch,it looked kinda silly, kinda like buddy holly+ a kung fu movie wrapped into one film....one lousy film.This is not one of those movies that is so bad it's good ,...it's just plain bad.My friends shot me looks of horror after about 15 min of this crappola, then I was getting all the insults a bad movie choice deserves...but this time they were right!! One thing we all agreed on it had to go! It was boring,cheesy,cheaply done(and yes I know this is an indie movie)and just really not entertaing.The only saving grace is the music by a group called the Red Elvis' they themselves are a weird mix of russian music and inst-surf music,sounds weird but it actually comes off pretty good in comparison to the movie. Like the headline says above: ""CRAPPY FILM,GOOD MUSIC"""
3,Great Spoofy Type Movie,"This movie is a complex juxtoposition of images and sceens. The movie is almost like a live action anime. There are a lot of things going on that are not entirely explained, but the movie is fun to watch. If you like those actions movies with a touch of cheese, you'll love this!"
1,It has to get better.,"We've all seen movies that we thought had to get better at some point, ending up watching the entire film when we should have left an hour earlier.The cinematography was impressive and original. That's my excuse for the one star. The story was horrible. The acting was good, given the fact that they had no script to work with.This is a film that had no business being made. I think it would have worked marginally well as a comic book, but I can't say for certain.Only in LA could people like this film, where everyone professes to love everything no matter how bad it truly is."
2,This movie is a waste of time.,"When you think ""shall we turn this off, or just finish it"" and others begin leaving within the first 10 minutes of a movie, it's certainly a waste of time/money. It's not funny, it's certainly not serious, there was no plot, in general: no point. The filming was done perfectly however, which I do not understand. Where did they get such a budget? ugh."
2,The cinematography was nice...,"I can allow for an incredible amount when it comes to movies, but it still didn't help me to enjoy this one. I know that this film wasn't meant to be taken as high art, but I couldn't even stomach it as a parody. The only things I did like about it were the beautiful scenery, camera angles, and some of the comedy. Waaaaay too much slow mo - take all that out and its running time wouldn't last 45 minutes, and seeing as how it only has about 5 minutes worth of story, you'd better heat up some popcorn.I love films of the nature that ""Six-String Samurai"" represents, and I can at least admire the concept, but its execution was horrible."
4,cool,"Its worth checking out,plenty of sword action,a cool idea stretched out a little too thin,not sure about the ending,4.5 stars actually."
1,WOW...... This is REALLY BAD,"I usually LOVE B movies, cult etc... Killer Tomatoes, Wild Zero, all the mad max wannabes.THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.These reviews below where it is positive??? NO WAY.Usually a B has SOMETHING good. Terrible acting, cool explosions. Bad filmography, funny gore etc.... You get my point. SOME redeeming qualities.This movie has no cool effects, no action shots worth anything, ONE vehicle in a post-apocalyptic world, just bad bad bad."
5,Fan-freakin-tastic,"Who knew? I always thought I wanted to be a cop, or a fireman, or even a computer programmer. Turns out what was really right for me was to be come a guitar wielding, katana swinging bada** wandering the wastelands of a post-apocolyptic US, on a sacred quest to become the next King. So there you have it, this movie changed my life. Too cool for words hero, The Red Elvises (""Nice Shoes""), incredible cinamatography, what more could you want. Oh yeah, rockin' soundtrack. Got that too."
3,Wacky,Of all the post apocalyptic rock opera samurai movies out there this is likely the absolute king. Is there any one else going for that genre?
5,A Great Movie,"This movie should definitely be regarded as one of the best cult classics of all time. The story is silly, the acting atrocious - but it's charming in the way of Army of Darkness."
4,"Say ""Cheese!""","Sure, fine... this movie doesn't have much of anything positive for it. Bad acting, bad action, bad story, plot, execution... even the comedy is pretty bad.But for some strange... absurd... unexplicable reason... I like this film! Maybe it is the pure campyness.. somewhat reflective of a bad attempt at a Sam Rami film... I don't know... rent it, buy it... catch it on TV. Watch it!"
5,a very respectable independant film,"this film had alot of charisma. amazingly enough, there was hardly any blood shed, and that made the movie even better. the violence was tasteful and not over done. the action sequences were well choreographed. the characters were memorable and lots of fun. very few people would take the chance to make a film such as this, im glad someone did."
4,One Bad Ass Buddy Holly!,"No matter how hard I tried, I could never adiquatly describe this movie to my friends, because this film fits into no standard genre. Nor could I accuratly describe how good it is and how much my friends would dig it, being the raving martial arts fans they are. So now I've just gotta buy it, sit 'em down and show 'em and I'm sure they'll be writing one of these reviews to. P.S. It's good to know that in all the alternative realities there are out there that in at least one Wolfman Jack lives on!!!"
5,Wonderful idiocy,"This is NOT a story to take seriously. This is simply a fun piece of what Ray Bradbury calls ""sublime trash"". This has no redeeming values, will teach you absolutely nothing and has no real moral, either. However, it is a fun and wonderful way to spend 90 minutes or so. It moves from one crisis to another quickly, is full of action and has all kinds of one liners. Personally, I loved it, but then, I have a sense of humor unlike some of the other reviewers."
5,Punky Fresh movie!,Awesome movie that's produced independently to boot. Excellent movie that is definite to become a cult hit soon.
5,Buddy Holly with kung-fu on a post-apocalyptic quest,"This is the best movie I saw last year. It has tremendous action (very HK cinema, no surprise considering Jeffrey Falcon's roots) a wonderful score, and a truly fun plot."
5,"Strange, Fun, and Addicting","When I first heard about this movie from a friend, I thought -- B-Movie/Cult Film. But this movie is so much more than a Cult Film and doesn't have the gore of a B-Movie. The music is fantastic, the acting is great, and the premise -- although far-fetched -- is just wacky enough to get you addicted. This is a movie you'll want to watch over and over again. And if you want some great Ska-Punk-Rockabilly, I suggest you pick up the Soundtrack or buy some Red Elvis' albums."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I romanced myself with a broomstick","This is perahaps one of the most artistically flawles films ever seen by man. It was an absolute cinamatic masterpiece. It is the movie upon which all other should be compared. It defined our generation, and every other generation for that matter. As many of my colleagues have pointed out the cinamatography was genius, the acting was superb, the direction was perfection, and the plot was nothing short of divine. It is the king of films...."
5,There is a god... and he plays the guitar,"This was definately the greatest movie I've seen this year. And although it reassured my biases against child actors, I'm forcing all of my friends to watch this even if it requires me to resort to violent force and the use of poisonous cephalopods."
5,Extreme Faith Bible,Excellent replacement for my son who lost his Bible and needed one who needed one for a good price until we had more money for a higher quality print format.
5,Extreme Faith Bible,Extreme Faith Bible is what we chose to give the families we presented with Christmas Food Boxes. Our church is trying to provide for physical and spiritual needs of underprivileged families.
5,best,"this is one of the best albums i have bought. shannon is one of the most originial lyricists i have ever seen. her music is so brilliant and well executed, it's amazing. and man, her voice. it moves me like no other one. you can really feel her pain and emotions in each and every word."
3,"Songs need to be longer, lyrics need a translator","a lot of potential here, however, I found a lot of the songs leaving me in the lurch... some of these tunes have EPIC written all over them, but Ms. Wright stops them when they are just getting going.There is no hope in hell of this stuff getting on mainstream radio(and that's a good thing!) so don't be afraid to stretch these out, cause these tunes need them. And the lyrics! Holy DAMN! What ARE you talking about?!Both of these points make this album fairly disapointing but so chock full of talent I had to give it a 3."
1,This record is abysmal,"I tried to like this--really, I did. Her voice is among the worst I have ever heard. I love dissonant music--I like Masonna, John Coltrane's ""Ascension,"" Skullflower, etc. This sounds more like Lilith Fair combined with P.J. Harvey. It's cloying and grating. After a while, it becomes a dull, maddeningly annoying noise--kind of like workmen banging things outside your window early on a Sunday morning. If I weren't so lazy, I'd sell it to someone."
3,A Bit Over Cautious,"While I agree with the statement that one can never be too careful regarding safety on an EMS call, no matter where it is, I also believe in the validity of Sigmund Freud's ""sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.""If one was to follow this book to the letter, you would nearly have to slather war paint on your face every time you went on a night call!There are definitely some gems of wisdom to be gained from the text, but take a lot of it with a grain of salt. It is more useful to the EMT or Paramedic with a few years experience and has a fair idea of what he's doing than to a green rookie. At the end of the day, there is no substitute for experience. (PS: dont read it before bed time, it'll give you nightmares!) :-)"
3,Rather disappointing,"I've been a BE fan for a while now, and I'm sorry to say that ""With Teeth"" wasn't as good as I would have hoped. Their tune selection, as always, is excellent, but various tracks seemed badly mixed so you could hardly hear the vocals, and I'm not particularly fond of the new female vocalist's voice. The drums are an interesting addition, but I don't think they really add anything to the mix. So I would suggest buying all their other CDs, starting with ""More Bad News"", and only picking up this one to round out your collection."
5,Indispensable!,This is one of the best reference books that i have come across! Highly reccomended to any literary or theory students! It is very comprehensive and is one of the best reference books out there.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"With the cost of food and conserns about food safety, this book will help me raise poultry with assurance that it is the best possible.This booklet has detailed information about how to castrate a cockrel (rooster)chicken and is applicable to other types of fowl.I was interested in this skill to have good meat and leave the hens to lay eggs.Homegrown poultry may not be as cheap as Wal-Mart, but I am more at ease knowing my familys food isn't subject to a nationwide recall! Also, if allowed to roam for a few hours a day, the chickens greatly reduce the insect population."
4,Scenes from an Ordinary Life: Getting Naked to Explore a Writer's Process and Possibilities,"This book was quite different from what I expected. But, as a wanna-be writer, perhaps I didn't know what to expect. That said, I gained a lot from Lou and am glad I took the steps to read it."
5,Good price,I used these decals to decorate two children's chair I refinished for my grandchildren in Florida. They are too young to really appreciate them but their parents loved them.
5,High Quality Foredom Power Carving Stones,"As usual, the name Foredom refers to excellance in power carving. These blue stones are ideal for fine detail work. A valuable addition to the arsenal of anyone pursuing power carving."
4,lots of good alternative christmas music,"Amazon lost the ball here...A.R.P.'s offering is ""Little Drummer Bwoy"" not as they phrased it in the title selections. This title alone is worth the price of the album!"
2,didnt remove the Splat!,"My daughter dyed her naturally blonde hair with pink Splat. 2 months later, we wanted the dye our before her gymnastics competition, and this didnt touch it! Maybe would have worked if we hadnt waited so long, i dont know. didnt work for us."
2,Ruiner!,"I bought this product because I had dyed my hair black many times, and I wanted to go back to my natural color. I followed the directions but, it turned my roots a blonde/orange color and a big circle in the back of my head was blonde. Everything else was black. My hair was ruined and I had to spend $150 to fix it."
5,Great Item,"I couldn't find this item anywhere but on ""Amazon"" neither Menards or any of our local hardware stores knew of such a replacement item. This screen was very easy to install. Took less then 10 minutes. I am a very happy customer. Thanks Candi"
4,Very Bright,"I Love this light, its super bright and easy to handle, but I didnt not recieve the car adapter shown in the picture and written in the disciption which is really the reason I bought it so I can keep it in my car, other than that I have no complaints."
1,VOMITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the only thing worse than the bad acting is the directing of the film. I guess anyone with a camcorder can make a ""movie."" This movie is like a bad meal. Ingredients: bad acting, no story line. What a waste"
4,Cute movie and nice story,This is a cute movie with more plot line than one might think. It was funny and touching. A little bit of romance and a lot of hot guys. What more can you want? Mink Stole as the aunt is very good. I enjoyed this movie.
2,"light on writing, sex, acting","Lightweight film, which would be okay, but the plot isn't interesting, the sex isn't tempting and the writing isn't clever."
4,Fun Movie,I enjoyed the cute actors and the funny leading lady. It was a guilty indulgence. (No academy awards here though) :)
4,Loved it,"Very camp at times, some overacting, but it adds to the charm of the movie. I've see the whole series, and hope they keep making more. I'll definitely buy these in the future."
3,Not silver tip badger hair?,"I bought this from Amazon-Marketplacer ""Perfect Beauty"".It seems to be just a pure badger brush whose tips have been bleached, NOT a brush with silver tip badger hair.The box it comes in says ""100% Pure Badger Shaving-Brush"".You can check omegabrush.com (Italian site) and it says nothing about this model having silver tip badger hair.[...]I also would not recommend buying from Perfect Beauty unless you wish to wait 2+ weeks for your product."
4,Great starter book for people unfamiliar with VBA Excel,"This was my first book I used to learn the VB intricacies of Excel. Showed me step-by-step what is possible as far as developing a user application, with a VB fueled spreadsheet. One thing that I liked was code that removed all the users toolbars (makes the visual screen area maximized) and the upon closing, puts them all back. Had results in just about a week with some help from the Microsoft news groups (Excel related). Recommended as a starter for those unfamiliar with VB or Excel."
2,Not for beginners,"The book does not do a good job with the fundamentals of VBA. Very brief in its explanation of objects, properties, and methods. Gives plenty of examples but often refers you to Excel help to find out more info about a particular item. If I wanted to do that I would not have bought the book. Very disappointed."
1,Very Bad book - Reed Jacobson's excel VBA,"Very bad book to learn Excel Visual BasicCons1) For beginners this book is terrible. The author has not explained the concepts in a methodical way.2) Estimated Time: At the start of each chapter the author gives ""Estimated Time"" to finish the chapter. No way anyone can finish the chapter in the said time. Grossly Wrong. How in the world anyone can do this?3)Very brief in its explanation of objects, properties, and methods. Simple concepts were complicatedPros1) Nice approach - step by stepSounds good but the book is terrible.2) Project - Answers and CD provided.Someone with excel experience can learn from this, but not beginners.Conclusion: Bought this book with the hope that I will be able to master some good excel knowledge, but I was really disappointed with the way this book is written. Wasted so much time trying to grasp the subject. Hate it. Don't ever buy such a piece of junk."
4,Nine West Women's Elirissa Platform Sandal,THE DEISGN IS VERY FUNKY AND ELEGANT.The insoles are nicely cushioned and the height is quite comfortable due to the broadness of the heel.
2,5th number one single for P.Diddy,This was a number one hit by B2K and P.Diddy from last year it was alright but nothing very special other then the fact it gave P.Diddy his 5th number one the most ever by a rapperLyrics 6/10 Production 5/10 Overall 5.5/10
5,the absolute best tire inflator,"I work professionally as a mechanic, and had one of these for years. I also have a MILTON brand dual foot style, but i prefer this one.After about 5 years of everyday abuse, I finally dropped it one too many times and bent the air gauge. I was distressed to see that my tool guy no longer stocked this style on the truck, so I decided to try to find one online. Thank you amazon prime, it was less than half price what i paid on the truck years ago.I find that this style of inflator easier to hold on the valve stem and the gauge portion where you rear the psi is easy to read at a glance. No glass magnifier to crack, and the inflator tip holds up well to use hunderds of times a week, and no batteries to go dead.Look no further, this is the one you want."
2,Knowledge without understanding,"Carig Keener in his commentary on the book of Revelation recommended this book. It is full of historical details that would be of interest to Mr. Keener. But, to my chagrin, Mr. Aune cannot tell the difference between Christian prophecy and shamanism/magic/demon possession. To him it is the group in power that determines which kind of prophecy is acceptable and which is not. A tremendous amount of knowledge without any discerment. He views himself as an unbiased historian without a theological axe to grind..."
5,New Generation Motown Soul,"When you think of Detroit House you think 1) hard bass 2) sharp high-hats or acid lines 3) a minimal but veryyyyyy soulful sound. That's what Mr. Baxter delivers. As the title indicates, he's been at this for quite a while and it shows. If ya dig tech-house, you'll die of joy listening to this. Baxter mixes brilliantly from start to finish, and have no doubt he sounds everybit as good live. This blows aways several other Blake Baxter tapes I've gotten over the years. It's a litte techno, a little deeeep club soul, but 100% pure Detroit house.Every track here is full of Detroit soul. And let there be no mistake Detroit House really kicks. Don't try to sleep to this one- just go ahead and jack! This is one of the best I've heard in a very long time."
2,Useless with LCD,"This was perfect for my 19"" CRT for many, many years, but with LCD monitors it is an eye sore and takes up too much desk real estate."
3,"When they say complete, they mean it.","I would have preferred a volume of nothing but Lovecraft's ingenious and immersing works of fictional poetry, and I do not think I'll read all the way through this weighty tome... I actually bought it because it contains ""Fungi From Yuggoth"", a favorite of mine, and for that I shall enjoy it... until I find that same work in a different collection, at which time this one will be retired for sure."
1,WinCraft Keg Gril,"This grill is constructed poorly and the directions are lousy. The handles are made of Bakelite and are an integral part of the grill. The legs snap into the handles and fold up to hold the lid on. When we tried to fold the legs up for carrying the ahndle broke in three pieces.I made a temporary repair so we could use it that day for a game. The propnae tank I bought that they recommended did not work with the regulator they supplied, however, I did use another cylinder I had and that worked. When you fold the handles down to use the grill there is a good chamnce you will not get them in the slots completely and the grill will colapse while using it. I contacted [...] who was selling the grill on Amazon.com asking them for a new handle. They wanted me to pack up the broken handle and ship it to them. I don't have time for that. Their customer service is lousy like the grill."
4,Great Female slant on Texas History,"This book brings to light some stories of TX Women. Well written and documented, it's entertaining as well. This was a welcome addition to my Texas History collection. Thanks for writing it!"
2,Not bad for a first novel...,"....I liked the ""kill SaddamHussein"" plot angle, but unfortunately it got abandoned tooquickly in favor of a ""bad guys kidnap girl"" plotline, whichI found far less interesting. I didn't find any of the characters inthis book particularly likeable, so found it hard to really care aboutwhat happened to any of them (very little time was spent on JessicaBaldwin). A very humorless book, with humorless characters. Too manycharacters that really brought nothing to the story (President,Baldwin's wife, the Iraqi, Sarah's mother, etc.). Also, too manycharacters that were poorly fleshed out. And a few hard-to-believeplot points.But overall, not a bad book for a first novel. I'llbe interested to see what his next book is like."
5,Epic tale of intrigue amidst the highest perches of U.S.,"Steve Samuel's exquisite style of telling a tale of intrigue,double cross and some healthy doses of reality about the workings of our Government make this novel a must read!The pace was gripping,the story complex enough to keep one pondering the next move of the dauntless protagonist Sarah and the ever growing supply of plotting enemies.The immense detail of people,places and scenes allowed for maximum entertainment.It was a thrill to try and read as much as posssible at one sitting.Then came the inevitable ""finishing"" of the book the next day! Hopefully Mr. Samuel will have much more to offer to keep that thrill going and going. Well done,extremely well done."
5,Wow!,"Do not run reds, but drive fast to your bookstore to get your hands onto page one of this book. Be assured, your hands will not leave this book until they are at page 340."
3,Mr. Samuel asked me to read his book.,"Actually, the story line is quite good. A young woman gets a monster promotion then quickly gets involved in a conspiracy to destabilize the Arab world. Due to her skill, cunning, and great connections, she's able to overcome a multibillionaire's scheme and possibly save the world (a slight exaggeration there).I did have a problem with several errors concerning technical points in the story. However, reading some of the other reviews, I may have been one of the few to notice such things. That aside, the book read well."
3,Exciting But A Bit Too Predictable And Contrived,"Steve Samuel is off to a good start in his first book, Rock, Paper, Scissors, but he's not quite ready to be in the top-tier of suspense/thriller writers. The plot is fast-moving, exciting and has lots of action. However, too frequently the action is predictable with not many real surprises. Furhter, without going into detail, several of the characters and some of the plot twists, while interesting, were too over the top and contrived for my taste. Nonetheless, Rock, Paper, Scissors is worth reading and Samuel is an author worth watching, but I'd recommend that this book is one to wait for until it comes out in paperback or to take from the library."
3,Pretty Decent Thriller,"A good story on the life of Sarah Peterson in her Washington adventure. Good story-line involving the higher ups in government. The villans get tamed and the sake of good display the way to achieve the greater good. Lots of interesting twists, some can be predicted, others a surprise. Revenge, high stakes and motive play a key role."
1,Item not as shown,I was disappointed that the item pictured was not the item I recieved. The # 3964 which was in the description was for a full sized iron. The pictured iron is # 3932. I hope this can be changed so others don't get the wrong iron.
5,DWR RULES! GRADE K.A.!,"i love this band with all my heart. they really rock and rock hard for you live. they're album is really good. however, i don't know if its worth 30 bucks to get this cd, but either on is great. listning to jabe and grimm mf is like hearing seperate voices become one....something poetic like that. anyway, that's my piece. the album rocks and you should get it cause my mom says so. PEACE!SKG/OJane"
3,Moderate rock,"While not a bad cd I can find little rave about. Its very well done vocally and instrumentally but in my opinion not very memorable. Feel so Stupid(the single, though I didnt know it till recently) is by far the best track. The singer is very similar to Brandon Boyd and Doug Robb of Incubus and Hoobastank. The emcee is a little harder to coral into a category however, though at times he reminds me of (HED)PE voalist MCUD. Genearally I steer clear of bands that stick to an obvious and overplayed pop format, and DWR are far from cookie cutter pop, but taking their sound to a more radio friendly territory would guarantee sales in an era where Alien Ant Farm and Lost Prophets dominate radio and MTV. If your looking for something less glossy and studio-perfect than Linkin Park but in the same genre give these guys a shot. This band has potential, their debut cd just lacks what makes their live shows so entertaining."
2,"Massive amount of potential, but...","Every once in awhile, you hear a band that has an unreal amount of talent, but just does not seem to know what to do with it. Darwin's Waiting Room is, in my opinion, at the top of this heap, and is set to explode, but consider the timer still ticking after this record. A few times over the coarse of ""Orphan"", you can hear what this band could really do. One thing they really need to do is learn how to utilize the two singers (one rapper, one singer) that they have. The singer is way to often just mindlessly holding notes in the back round. Other than that, they are good... but having problems with your singers drags you down quite a bit. The writing is sensational, and the record is worth buying just for ""All I Have Is Me"". All and all, this record is a good icebreaker, but do yourself a favor and wait a few months for Darwin's forth coming effort. (If I could, I'd rate ""Orphan 2 1/2 stars)."
3,Decent...,"The album is not really all that I hoped it would be. I heard so many great things about this album, but was some-what disapointed with this pure nu-metal album. I am not a real big fan of nu-metal, so my review might be misleading. The songs themselfs are all really the same, and the music has it's hard points, but what I was surprised at is the choruses. I mean, almost every single chorus on the album is memorable and catchy, especially on ""Feel So Stupid"" (Table 9)and ""Live for the Moment"" (now there's a shout along chorus, ""F*ck that, fight back, live for the moment, it's now or never so let's stand together..."" genius). But other thatn the catchy choruses and some decent riffs, the album is just another nu-metal casualty...-MC"
3,Great CD...If you like cd's that come from a Xerox machine,"Seriously, this is a good CD. But I really liked it better the first time I heard it when it was called Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park. It's basically nothing new musically and the one MC/one singer vocal attack is a carbon copy of Linkin Park. But the songs are pretty good."
3,gets stale,"i was very exicted eith this cd when i first got it but now it sounds stale and boring standout tracks-feel so stupid,live for the moment,all i have is me(best song),another way."
2,like Linkin Park? umm no...,"Okay...well I'm a big fan of Linkin Park. I understand that their style isn't for everyone, and wasn't for me for a long time. I love heavy music, heavy metal...but Linkin grew on me with their sound and talent.Everyone saying you will love these guys if you love Linkin Park is full of it. Mike Shinoda (guitar, vocals, Emcee) of Linkin Park, has a voice about 50 times better than the ""emcee"" of Darwin. The Darwin guy sounds like he should be in damn Beastie Boys.They have some catchy songs that wouldn't be bad at all if it wasn't for this guy who ruins any chance. Guitars are basic, but decent sounding. Band resembles Limp Bizkit much more than Linkin if any comparision...but is most like another small band, Lifer."
2,Mediocrity in Action,"Im not one to judge a CD based on its genre. I've stated in many other Rapcore reviews that just b/c a cd is rapcore i dont dismiss it, that is true, but this is not a very good cd. This is why the genre is going downhill, the cd's coming out sound very very similiar. They sound like every other new rapcore band out there, (Endo especially). This is a cd to be overlooked."
3,decent cd- exellent band,"the cd is pretty good, but i must say that it lacked the raw energy of their live shows. I am a big fan of these guys , since catching them live a few time here in birmingham. their style is not really for everyone, but if you even remotely like this album, then catch them live you'll love it"
5,I have felt the boom!,"I bought the Sonic Overload CD set a few months ago, and I had never played a Bass Mekanik CD on my stereo system before. You can imagine my surprise! My system consists of a Roadmaster speaker (RBB3000, I think) with 2 6.5"" low/midrange (20hz is the lowest it can handle) 300-watt woofers and 2 22,000hz tweeters, a Roadmaster BASS BLASTER 600-watt subwoofer (10"", it had a neon light but the controller module got fried somehow), and 2 50-watt Magnavox bookshelf speakers (mainly for bass). I give the Sonic Overload CDs 5 stars!"
3,"its okay, but not the best",i have two pg 12's with over 1200 watts and am able to hit under 15 hz but this cd dosen't really have but about one or two tracks that really hit well
5,COOL AND CRISP!,"This is almost a sequel to ""A MILLION YEARS OF DOO WOP"" by Jamie / Guyden so get it, it deserves an audience of you oldie fanatics and collectors. I've been buying a lot and try to give many reviews as possible, AND I read a lot to which have been very helpful on what to buy and what NOT to buy (especially remakes by the original artist 30 years later, ugh!)I'm sure there is a PHILLY DOO WOP CLASSICS VOL. 1, is there folks?"
5,Nice addition to anyone's Doo Wop collection...,"If you like Doo Wop music, you'll like this cd. It will help bring back memories of the 50s & 60s."
4,"Fast Read, Good Info","I bought this to get a little more background on Ireland, I am going to be spending a week there and reading this was helpful. There is a lot of information that I don't need, like info about living there, working there and buying a house there, but the historical info was really helpful. I love these ""Culture Shock"" books! Super fast reads, just make sure you get the newest edition available for up to date information."
4,A Useful read before travel,"Provides very useful insights to the Irish culture, especially the more rural regions. A must read to understand how best to get along with the locals. Relatively short and easy to read."
4,Cognitive Therapy and The Emotional Disorders,We found this book to be very helpful when working with our adopted Son with emotional and mental health issues. It helped us to see things in a better light and to understand why he does some of the things he does.
3,Simple Student,"Reading Cognitive Therapy for a book report, I found myself boggled down with heavy...almost convoluted terminology. The book could have been written lighter, and yet not miss the meaning nor the purpose of writing it. I would suggest the book for someone who not only had a sold foundation in psychology ,but also has the ability to cipher through the heavy language."
5,Very easy and educational,"From the originator of the practice, this is an easy book to understand, and had some very helpful tools in it, especially if you are already proactive with therapy."
5,one of my favorites!,"I loved the item. One of my favorite movies. It was shipped quickly, in beautiful condition. If amazon has it, that is where I will be ordering!"
3,OK,I was expecting more music (Frank Sinatra) and perhaps a more responsible father. The acting was good.
4,AKA Frankie Screws Up Again........,"Sinatra is such a dufus in this movie. He gives up the beautiful, kooky goddess Shirl (Carolyn Jones) just so he can play house with a red-head chick. Besides that disappointment, this is a wonderful film. Not to mention you get a fabulous performance of the song about the ant & the rubber tree that just sticks in your head.....years later. A definate must see for any Carolyn Jones fan. My favorite part is when she's out surfing and comes from the water all salty. Two thumbs up"
5,Great Series,"I enjoy ""series"" books and this one although related settings does not have carry over characters. This one was totally entertaining. Enjoyed the reality of the novel. True to life characters with a few twists and turns to keep it interesting . Will look for Diana Dempsey's future works"
4,Spicy Mystery,"Normally, I tend toward softer mysteries that are a little cute and corny. But To Catch the Moon was a great break from my pattern. This mystery is heartracing and exciting, with great characters and a little grime at the edges. Enjoy this mystery but make sure your doors are locked."
1,"Not helpful at all- there is nothing wrong with ""classics""!","While I was originally intrigued by Mr. Somers' myriad of poetry selections, I became extremely disappointed in the virtual lack of fundamental terms and techniques. Thus, while the contemporary poems were entertaining, I was looking for a more inclusive introduction to poetry. I believe students need to be exposed to the classics in order to appreciate the contemporary-- one needs to know the rules in order to break them.Furthermore, I do not think this book is well suited to upper-level English classes."
4,Great Effort,This is a good idea but the African percussion is drowned out. Needs more balance. Don't just remix these African songs into techno drown-outs. The idea is to blend traditional African instruments and rhythms with modern technology and make folks dance. I think I'm going to do it myself...
2,"A great concept, underwhelming in its execution","I am a big fan of many of the Malian artists featured on this collection. Some of these remixes live up to the originals, but alas, most of them don't. Neba Solo's ""Noumou Foly,"" for example, as remixed by Frenchman Frederic Galliano, loses much of its precious steam. Galliano actually slows it down, reduces its momentum and does little beside. I don't know much about techno (is that even the genre here?), but I don't think it's supposed to make its source material LESS danceable.I did like the treatment given to Abdoulaye Diabate's ""Foronto,"" which rocks on this CD, and a few of the other remixes. But given the promising idea these DJs started with, I'm not so satisfied with the results."
5,Trip The Night Fantastic,"We first heard Soul Ballet on a local modern jazz station about two years ago. The first time we heard their music, we were mesmerized, to say the least. We immediately went out and bought their other three albums, but until just this week, were unable to find this one. The other reviews here are on the money in that their music is sexy, sensuous, relaxing, and most definitely fit the Saturday night with the lights down criteria. Unlike other artists, we never tire of listening to Soul Ballet. What a shame they have so few CD's to offer. A very distinct sound all it's own, which is very unusual in this day and time."
5,Fantastic!!!,"I have had this cd for over two years. Every time I put it on I am completely swept away. I LOVE IT!!!! I purchased it when I was living in Charlotte, and I was homesick for LA. I heard Blu Girl on the radio, and fell in love. When I purhcased it, I never made it past the first two tracks, because I kept hitting ""repeat"". Then one day, I made it through the entire cd. Now, I listen to it all and often. It is sexy, smooth, and takes you to another place....that is if you are a person who really feels music. You will not be sorry with this purchase!"
2,Avent Sippy Trainers,"I got a bunch of these for my 8 month old son and he's been working on getting the liquid through the sippy top. He's a good sport and will work on getting 4 oz. of juice out of it, but it the day care lady says that it takes him the whole day to finish it. My parents bought him a sippy cup with a larger more ""bite-able"" top (Foogoo phase 1) and he seems to like that much better. And, it doesn't take him all day to finish his juice. :)"
2,"Baby doesn't like the shape, not natural enough...t","The Design of these needs to be more natural or shorter, baby has to open his mouth really big to get this in. He just looks at it and wants to play with the bottle instead of try to drink from it. It's too ""weird"" looking I guess, he pushes it away every time I've tried it. I also think it's too long for him to put his little mouth over on his own. This is not a good trainer spout that's for sure, maybe for older kid, it's more like a wide straw then sippy spout."
1,horrible,"I do not recommend these. I wanted them because the go right into our avent bottles... but no matter what I do and how I try they leak HORRIBLY!!! I would recommend finding something else, I know I am going to."
1,They Leak!,I have some of the older Avent cups that have three pieces to the spout and they never leaked at all. So when I bought the new spouts I did not think that they would leak either but I was wrong. Avent has changed there spouts to just two pieces and the air hole leaks fluid after your child begins drinking from the cup. I thought it was just my old cups so I went out and bought new cups and they do the exact same thing! I really thought these were great products with my first two kids but now with the third I am second guessing the quality of the products.
5,Fantastic product,"The Avent bottles can withstand a lot, so I didn't want to get rid of them (especially with how expensive sturdy sippy cups can be). This converted perfectly from the nipple to the sippy top. It snapped in and fit snugly with no leaks. Super easy to clean. I take out the seal because my son doesn't like to have to suck too hard to get the juice/milk... it still works perfectly."
4,Just as described,Just what I thought they'd be like. Arrived early. Couldn't find these individually sold anywhere. They work great with the kanteens!
2,Soft spout is impossible to clean!,"My 10 month old daughter has only ever had water to drink out of this sippy cup and I clean it daily, but for some reason the inside of the spout is now spotted with black mold that is impossible to scrape or clean off. It's like it's embedded right in the soft ""rubber""(?). The hard plastic parts are easy to clean, but the different material used on the spout to make it ""soft"" is impossible to clean properly."
3,ok item,I truly love the fact that my avent bottles are so compatible with so many different things. However this product can leak it does not always but it sometimes does. I had to switch to these tops because all my daughter did was play with the nipple instead of drinking her bottle. I do love them when they don't leak.
4,Good spout - very little difference between 6m and 12m version,"I wish I would have known that the only difference between these spouts and the ones for younger children is the color and the fact that these are made of hard plastic and the others are soft. Otherwise, no difference. I do like the Avent spouts in general as they are about as leak proof as a sippy cup spout can be."
2,Not a soft spout,"This is not a soft spout. It's hard. There is nothing wrong with it, but it is not as advertised. I'm not sure this is good for transitioning from a bottle to a cup."
4,Great sippys,"I tried a million different sippy cups, but my daughter just didn't take to the straw valve ones that were too difficult to suck from, or the freeflow BornFree that gave her more than she could handle. The straw cups without valves worked ok for her, but sometimes she would suck up too much and it would go down the wrong pipe.These spouts were perfect for playful drinking, but she would not take large amounts. Either way, I love that I extended the life of my Avent bottles (which I never used becuase they always seemed to leak) and no new bottles to get in the way. Good value."
2,Leave the rubber stopper on!,"I got these sippy adapters so that I can continue to pump and take milk to daycare in my AVENT bottles. The packaging shows a hand taking off the clear rubber stopper- don't do it!! The stopper is what makes it spill-proof. Child must suck in order for liquid to come out. I unfortunately threw them away before using them.I tried for the first time without the stopper and to my horror, when I retrieved my cooler bag from the fridge I found spilled milk everywhere! The sippy lids had leaked milk even with the clear dome caps on top. Not spill-proof without the rubber stopper piece. I wish I had read reviews."
2,Okay,"As I have stated with the trainer set, they are okay if your child takes to them, just don't buy more than one set if you are not sure your child will take it. I would recommend buying one set from Target ( or some grocery stores cary Avent) and trying first. If it works, then buy more sets online. You will know within days if your child will take to it."
3,avent sippy caps,"I thought these non-spill spouts would help my girls who don't want to use a cup as a transitional product. They won't drink from them any better. It was an idea from the mind of an adult, not from a baby mind - makes sense but not baby sense."
4,What a great idea!!,"These are such a nice alternative to having to invest more money into sippy cups once your child is fished with the ""bottle"". We spent a small fortune on Avent bottles, nipples, etc. only to end up with a son that went from the breast to a sippy cup. However with these handy ""spouts"" we can turn our small fortune into baby gear that we can continue to use. They are easy to put together and snap in and just as easy to disassemble and wash. Though if not put together correctly and snaped into place tightly they can leak. Overall a worthwhile product and I am extremely pleased with this purchase! Now if only other baby product manufacturers would come up with products that can be repurposed for maximum use -Yea Avent!!"
2,Extremely Leaky,These are not nearly as good as the yellow ones. They leak every time. I use them with the Pura bottles and have used the yellow Avent spouts since the beginning but have been unable to find them so I finally just bought these thinking they would be just as good. They're not.
3,Much better than the whole transition cup system,"If you're thinking about buying one of the ""training"" cups, just buy these instead and use them on bottles. The addition of a handle on ""training"" cups doesn't really add anything. The bottle is much less confusing for baby and, therefore, a much easier transition.That said, these spouts are a little hard to clean and there is a lot of ""air"" in the beverage when baby drinks with them, which frustrates her, I think. But that is a problem with ALL sippy cup spouts, not just these ones. We skipped this nonsense and went straight to straws for our babies, but some babies prefer sippy cups - in which case, these are a good way to go."
1,Leak like crazy.,All four that I purchased leak from the small vent hole opposite the spout. Get the 18 Month+ version if you can still find them.
4,"Interesting design, my kid aged into them.","They are easy to use and I liked the idea of just modifying my current avent bottles, but my kid never figured out how to get a good drink from them. She just chewed on the spouts. We had better luck with the nuby cups until she figured out how to drink from a spout shape.EDIT 6 months later: these have held up really well in the dishwasher and now that my kid knows how to drink from the spout shape, they're pretty great. We have recently taken off the plastic no-spill valve, and this made them my kid's favorite cup. They do spill a little when dropped without the valve, but it's a small amount compared to an open cup, and it still allows her to take big gulps when she wants. I added a star- I'm glad we kept them and tried them again once the general sippy cup concept was mastered."
2,NOT SOFT SPOUT,"They advertise it, or it shows if you search for soft spout and they are hard. They are probably a good option to convert your bottles into sippy cups, but my son did not like them. I think also it does not help that they are green so he paid even more attention that they looked different."
1,"Leak easily, hard to keep clean","The other reviewers were very accurate when they said these soft spouts leak. They leak if the cup is on its side, if its shaken at all, a lot when its upside down and onto the child when they are drinking. As a result, if your child is just learning to handle a cup, it will inevitably be in all of these positions and thus create a mess. Additionally, these spouts seem much harder for them to drink from than others (such as the NUK spouts). However, the most important aspect about these spouts that needs to be fixed is the fact that liquid gets caught in the chamber and begins to smell/mildew. Dishwashing and hand washing does not clean these spouts. Boiling them every use is tedious and may be hard on the integrity of the product as well. Not a recommendation."
1,Gassy baby...,"These create lots of tiny bubbles that my son swallows when he drinks from this top. It's a terrible design because the rubber on the back side covers the air vent and the spout so the air gets sucked into babies mouth instead of back in the cup. Boo! I was really excited to still use my Avent bottles to transition to cups, but this prodect doesn't cut it, I ended up buying other sippy cups."
2,undecided about this product,"My daughter will actually drink from these a LITTLE bit...she doesn't take bottles at all, though, so this is progress...BUT they leak sometimes from the smaller hole opposite the spout...the one for air flow i guess? i tried taking the spout out of the ring and re-inserting it to make sure it was in all the way...but they still leaked."
3,OK for a while,"When my son first started using sippy cups, this was a good fit. He could still try to suck on it (since it was on his bottle, it was a good transition). However, as he started getting older and liking to be in charge of his own cup, I've stopped using it. Liquid drips out of the air hole and tends to be as messy as any other standard sippy cup."
1,They Leak,"i bought these for my girls to attach to avent bottles i already had, but the milk was leaking from the hole at the side. i had these before for my son and they worked fine but it looks like they have changed the design. i am disapointed cos it is not cost effective to return for a refund and they r useless to me. A case of if it aint broke dont fix it!"
4,Book Critique,Other than the book having somewhat of a coffee looking spot in the front as soon as you open it...its perfectly fine. A very perfect condition book. My mom opened the plastic and started reading it herself. She found it very interesting. Thanks again!
3,Merchandising Class,Ordered for Merchandising class. Informative but as the times change the information will become unusful. I confess I didn't read all of the chapters as I had an awesome instructor who was far more interesting than the text.
2,ballroom dancing - advanced,this is more on a lower level than advanced. i was disappointed when there were only three steps to each dance. i would love to see her give more of an advanced video with more than 3 moves. i have her country dancing videos and they are more advanced than this video.
5,Very Satisfied From Ireland,"Service- ExcellentPrice- Incredibly due to our ridiculous tax system,Purchase and delivery of book halfway around the world cost half the price of the same item as new on the shelves of the cheapest Bookshop in IrelandQuality of Book.-Was stated as used.This is an understatement.Except for one small blemish on the first page,the book was as new in my opinion.Customs- No problems.Delivery- No Problems within a week and fitted in through the letterbox .Customer Service.-Excellent Had a slight problem with payment due to security features on my credit card.TN Valley books were understanding and Patient whilst the problem was being resolved.Payment-.Used 3V Card on this transactionReturn Customer-Yes will Use TN Valley books again."
3,it's ok kinda,"The begginig of this album is kind of ok, then its has some really turning down pieces.. as a ""putting together songs for the mood"" - poor job. Sorry guys. The idea is to be a pleasant background music which ideally helps the mood, not attract attention to the music, like you start thinking ""oo what an annoying song, when is it over?.. then it happen to be one of the longest songs in the album. Then you forget about music, and soon again something.. in one song girl had such a bad sense of music and something with voice.. umm.. this cd - set me in a mood of putting an album myself"
4,Almost a gem,"For seventeen tracks, despite a little crackle here or there, I thought I had found a little gem. Many titles,new to me, sung in the romantic Johnny Desmond manner, reminiscent of Dick Haymes. Not for the first time I wondered why he has not received greater acclaim. The highlight, for me, is "" In Love In Vain "", which captures perfectly, the agony of unrequited love. From track eighteen, however, it could have been a different singer; a completely different mood ; a completely different style. This is not to say they are not well sung, although, in the context of the first part of the CD, they are not to my taste. Why do CD compilers do this sort of thing ? Maybe others will find it acceptable. Personally, it spoiled what had promised to be a real gem."
1,"""Don't Put That In Your Mouth -- You Don't Know Where It's Been""","Not all versions of the Hebrew Bible are the same, and this one is of unknown provenance. Who knows where this ""publisher"" got what it claims to be the Bible text? Who can vouch for the text's accuracy and reliability as the actual words of the Bible (without scribal or typographical errors)?This CD includes the 1917 translation published by the Jewish Publication Society (JPS). That translation is in the public domain and can be found online for free. Meanwhile, JPS itself has produced a newer translation (second edition, 1999), which is in modern English and draws upon the advances in biblical scholarship since 1917.JPS has published its newer translation together with a Hebrew Bible text whose editing is carefully documented. That edition is available in a very sophisticated electronic edition from Varda Books. That is NOT this CD. Buyers, don't be misled!"
4,BHS in paperback,"A clearly printed, well-bound version of the BHS. The main drawback, in exchange for the compact size compared with the full-size, hardback edition, is that the Masorah Parva notes in the margins and the footnotes are so small that they are very difficult to read. A magnifying glass is required to ease the eye strain. While the price for this edition is attractive, I wish I had purchased the full-size, hardback edition."
2,Better than nothing,"I read a review that said the sliders are great. They are. Everything in between is not. The plastic cracks. My biggest compliant is the mouse tray. It mounts to the side at a significantly lower level than the keyboard tray. It's killing my wrist. I avoid my mouse as best I can for this reason, but sometimes it can't be avoided. On these days, my wrist is sore for days."
2,Keyboard Tray,This product is a good idea that needs to be manufactured better. The mouse tray slide is made out of plastic and the slide broke after a couple of weeks of use. This makes the tray significantly less atractive. The gel wrist rests are very nice. The mouse tray is a little small but would have been very useful if it had not broken.
2,Psychology for slaves,"There's nothing in it about building authority or winning over enemies, rather you will find the usual Buddhist practice of rationalizing intellectual laziness, submissiveness, and concrete-bound (non-) ""thinking"". Calling a person practicing what the book preaches a warrior is in my opinion highly misleading. Real warriors interested in personal emancipation and the philosophy of winning will learn more from authors of books about life strategies (like Robert Greene or Balthasar Gracian) and sports psychology."

5,"THIS BOOK BRINGS YOU TO TEARS...OF HOPE, NOT SADNESS","Nani's story is unique. When I began to read it, I expected to feel sympathetic and even had the Kleenex tissues close at hand. Tragic stories always do that to me. However, I didn't expect to finish it with such an exhilarating feeling of hope, albeit in tears. What would have brought most people to their knees in absolute despair and surrender (probably contemplating suicide), only served to feed Nani's determination NOT to give up. The circumstances of her unfortunate exposure to TB and the life-changing aftermath for herself and her family are indeed a tragedy. But love, faith, and sheer force of will can turn even the most horrendous tragedies into valuable lessons which serve to teach and inspire others. Nani's telling of her story, framed by her multicultural roots (both Eastern and Western), reminds us of the many miracles of nature, through the grace of God. I was reminded that we are all here, by a miracle."
2,Total dullsville.,"Very dull album. Just goes to show you HAVE to listen before buying. I wasted a lot of money on jazz before I got wise. I bought this on the recommendation of a guy I have bought many CD`s from. Sorry, But I think it is the two instrument thing. However, I have had some dull stuff from Scott before. I`ll take this one back and donate it to the store."
2,Along Came Jones -For A bit Too Long,"Great premise, poorly delivered.Gary Cooper and his entire cast (excluding the horses) were guiltyof over acting in this whimsical tale of mistaken identityand the trouble that can develop- exploiting it.This film could almost be characterized as a stepping stone forGary Cooper's lighter comedic delivery in another obscure(but better film) The Saratoga Trunk co starring Ingrid Bergman."
3,Gary Cooper,"I am a Gary Cooper fan, enjoy all his movies as I see them, but do not think this is one of his better movies."
2,Poor Film - Very Flat,"This is just about as flat a film as you could make. The premise was the old mistaken identity one - a regular cowpoke is mistaken for a violent killer. Given a quality director and a MUCH better script something might have been made of this. Frankly the actors appear to be standing around waiting for someone to tell them what to do next. The Annie get your gun stuff trotted out at the finish seems not so much perdictable, as convenient. Very disappointing.Loretta Young deserves far better on DVD - despite all the problems and the B budget look of the picture she's an A star, at times, ravishing with a Kelly LeBrock sultriness to her eyes. (Of course Young could also act.)When will those perverse Gods in the film industry release some of her best films - such as The Farmer's Daughter? I mean she did win the Academy Award - how hard can it be to sell it? Why issue the bad and not the good? This sort of bungled mess does no ones reputation any good."
3,Cooper was Hollywood's greatest simpleton.,"Too bad they didnt give him any material to work with in this turkey.Cooper plays a dimwitted cowpoke (not much of a stretch) mistaken for a notorious outlaw. Some light moments, but no humor. Actually, about the only highlight here is a gorgeous Loretta Young as the outlaw's reluctant girlfriend. OK, I'm out of compliments.An interesting but overlong diversion, only for huge fans of the genre, or Gary Cooper."
5,Along Came Jones,"I am a huge Gary Cooper fan and this is one of my favorites. It is funny and as with all of Coop's movies very well acted. The DVD is good quality. There was no sound problem or choppiness in the flow of the film. If you like Gary Cooper and haven't seen this movie, you are definetely missing a good one! If you haven't seen any of Coop's movies - this is a good place to start."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This is supposed to be a wireless device that let's you serf the web, when in actuality it is nothing more than a pager. You send web inquirys, and it sends back a reply, then you have to send another... get the point. An absolute worthless device, with the limitation of 100,000 characters a month you run into the maximum rather quickly. If you have a cell phone just get a cable to connect it to a modem and your off. It's cheeper..."
4,Works Great,"This springboard module is pretty good, but you've got to check which paging service your specific module will work with. For instance, since I own a Skytel module I am only able to use Skytel service. That means you can't price shop for service at all. You are limited to whichever company your module is preprogrammed for. Hopefully this is some useful information if your considering buying one. It only costs about [money]/month for email service on your PDA which is a pretty good deal, considering I can use my email service pretty much where ever I like."
1,"Nice effort, But does not protect","I bought this for my newborn and myself. After I applied a small amount to my baby's face (only on the left side) his face became very pink. Over the next few days, his face turned bright red, scaly, and pustuly. It took 2 weeks for the pustules to go away. As for myself, it made my skin a bit greasy, suffocate, and sweat. I never spend more than 2 hours in the sun. But even with 1 tablespoon of product, it did not protect me from sun damage (spots) I will stick to other natural mineral sunscreens now.On the plus side, it is a good moisturizern for those with dry skin. It has a light, pleasant fragrance to it."
2,Not planning a return visit to this hostelry,"I bought this CD while on a flying visit to Ireland since I already own several De Dannan CDs and have been in general very pleased with their eclectic mix of instrumental pieces and folk songs from their ever-changing lineup over the years. But this album - a tribute, according to the liner notes, to the impact on Irish music of rock and roll - is simply 15 well-known rock and roll standards (such as Hey Jude, Whiter Shade of Pale, Bohemian Rhapsody) played on various combos of fiddle, accordion, guitar, whistle, pipes etc. giving a vaguely Irish flavour. The tracks feature no vocals. I found it all quite bland and close to Muzak - fine for background music when entertaining but I haven't bothered to put it on my iPod, where all my other De Dannan CDs have gone."
2,missing in action.,"I'm a big fan of the accompaning artwork when it comes to movies and music. This DVD movie had none on the cover and none on the DVD its self,simply that of the company that sold it. It reminded me of a pirated DVD knock off. I wont buy from the company again. I expected quality, something I could show off, I didnt get it."
1,not for 8 year olds,"This might be good for 5 or 6 year olds, but, too babyish for my 8 year old grandson."
2,Not for children,Game is meant for young children but it is hard to navigate through the different levels. Not much fun for children
3,Podr√≠a ser m√°s entretenido,"Pens√© que ser√≠a m√°s entretenido este juego y aunque lo compr√© para mis hijos que son fan√°ticos de bob esponja, no los he visto tan entusiasmados. Bastante sencillo los gr√°ficos."
1,LINES!!!,"When my printer prints, there are blank lines in the middle of the picture. Doesn't work. Can't fix it either."
2,Michael Park's CD,I found the CD quite interesting . His voice has changed over the years. I would rate the CD about 2 stars.
2,"Good tunes, musicians, very weak vocals","As my title states, ""Coolin' Soup"" would rate one star had it not been for the very decent session musicians. Michael's vocals are choppy and slurred. He doesn't sustain a note longer than maybe a half note (two beats). I felt as though I was in a piano bar with a mediocre singer. On the positive side was the nice jazzy/bluesy songs and good players. Sorry Michael, I liked your old stuff much better (his voice has changed through the years)."
4,Wonderful Songs,"If you liked Long Lonesome Highway you will enjoy Coolin' Soup. This is heartfelt music that makes you smile and cry at the same time. If you are looking for a slick production that sounds like it was engineered for the American Idol crowd, then this CD is NOT for you.Michael's voice is not that of a young man, but his song selections match his vocal ability beautifully. If you want music with depth and humor, then buy this CD."
5,LAY BACK AND RELAX,"IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE I FIRST LISTENED TO MICHAEL PARKS SING, BUT WHEN I DID I LOVED WHAT I HEARD. THIS IS A RETURN TO THAT WONDERFUL SOUND THAT IS ONLY MICHAEL PARKS! I LOVED THIS ALBUM WITH ITS SOFT JAZZ SOUND AND AGELESS STANDARDS. IT IS JUST GREAT!TRY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
4,Love the comb. Brush is useless...,"I love the fact that the tines of the comb form a curve that follows the contours of my daughter's head. I don't feel like I'm raking her scalp. It's also pretty ergonomic and easy to hold. It's cute, but I more appreciate the function of it!The brush is too soft to be of any use. I have had it since she was born and no matter what stage her hair was in, it never did anything.A previous reviewer says that her child loves to ""play"" with the brush. I don't let my daughter run around with pens, her toothbrush, spoons, or anything else that could jam itself in the back of her throat if she fell, so I wouldn't use this as a toy at this stage (19 mo). I still have it, so that maybe she can use it for a doll's hair or something when she's a little older."
1,DO NOT buy this product!,I bought this item because it was nice and it said that the bristles are soft and for 0 months! This is NOT true. I comb my baby's hair soflty and after that his skin was red and a bit irritated. Please DO NOT buy this product!
3,More cute than it is functional,"Very cute, love the comb, but bristles on the brush are too soft for anything but tiny baby hair. In my opinion that's a missed demographic in the design. They can't really appreciate the bug design at that age, and by the time they can, its completely inappropriate for their hair. The comb is terrific though."
1,bristles too hard to brush hair,"We bought this because we thought it would make a good toy/hair brush. The bristles are much too hard and close together to comb fine baby hair. It doesn't even do a good job on grown-up hair. The baby likes to grab it and wave it around, but that is all we can say that is good about this brush."
1,bad brush for baby,Brush is not suitable for newborn. It is too stiff and could hurt baby's skin. The brush given by hospital is alot softer.
1,You can do better,"Bought this for my 6 month old, and I need to just put it in the trash. It's dangerous and should not be marketed for babies or children. The comb teeth are VERY sharp and could easily scratch an adult scalp. The brush is also very tough and the bristles are so close together they are essentially worthless. Might work on my 2 year old when he has a buzz cut..."
4,Splash through the muck that is humanity,"Heavy/Light book - hard to explain. There is a realness to the characters that made me say ""Hey, I know that person!"" and sometimes even, ""Eeek! Too like the self I don't want to be!"" This ain't no fairytale collection. This is life, complete with trips to the toilet. Not exactly anti-heros, the main characters show their flaws unknowingly as they search to move forward, often even unsure what direction is forward or which way to up. Some do successfully navigate towards up. There is some hope. But some also stagnate and a few slide further down. The stories hang in my head weeks after reading them. Thankfully, Bannan has a wonderful dry wit that helps us do more than muck our way through human exposure. We can wade along splashing, enjoying the lightness of the weight that reveals our world to us and makes us think."
4,Better than the Poor attempt at the movie,"I have just finished the first two campaigns and am very glad that I bought the complete set. I was unable to access the Hydra campaign from the beginning and had to backdoor though the scene selection to get to the first of the viewing. Am a little disappointed in that, but was able to view the whole thing. I am trying to make the savoring of the complete series last as long as I can."
4,Better then the movie but not quite like the book,"Unlike the movie, this series had better weapons for the troops (heavy weapons)and better tactics (coordinated air and ground operations). Like current special operations. Not quite like the book in that suits were of limited use compared to the book. I enjoyed the series more then I thought I would."
4,Better than the movie(s) by far.....,"Had they actually completed the last 4 episodes, this would have gotten 5 stars.I feel this treatment of the excellent Heinlein novel is more ""accurate"" than the two movies. We get the bugs, the Skinnies, and some decent storytelling as well.The technical presentation is good. Clean images and sound throughout.If you've seen the movies, but haven't read the original novel, you should. I'd bet you'll like Roughnecks a great deal afterwards."
5,Great,"This is a great DVD box set. It has the whole season including some of the extra shows that were created when the series was taken off the air. If you liked the show you will love this collectible box set. Just be aware that if you buy the box set you will not get the extra behind the scenes footage found in the individual campings found on DVD. If you like me and just enjoy the show, this box set is one easy payment and is one nice box set!"
2,"Awful animation, poor physics shouldnt be allowed!","Like my title says, even when the technology was new, this looked god-awful. I'm a hardcore fan of the books as well as the movies, but this is just garbage. No extras, nothing. Plus you have to watch these guys and other objects bounce around, defying all physics. It looks worse than Captain Planet (the late animated crap)"
1,Wish I had my $$$ still.,"This was a cartoon, not a ""movie"" as I had expected. Was very disapointed when I discovered this. Not only that, but the script seemed horrid to me. The animations seemed stiff and forced, not fluid.Only watched the first one of the set.My own fault (not realising it was a cartoon)for not paying attention to the details when I was reading the available info."
2,Boring. Just...boring.,"The animation is not very good. The lips do not sync. If Disney could sync ""Steamboat Willie"" in 1928, the Roughneck animators should have been able to sync this. The stories are simplistic. Okay, what should I have expected from this series? If you have a simple story, then make it visually exciting (like the Starship Troopers film).My 10 year old son watched about 35 minutes of this before leaving to play with the cat. He was ""bored""."
5,A fun adventure with spectacular fx.,"This box set is missing some things.Like subtitles, and a few audio options. But if you plan on just watching it works well."
2,"Something Missing. OH yah, The Ending Of the Some Shows","While I was happy with most, I found three problems so far. The Tesca Campaign, Klendathu Campaign and Court Martial of Lt. Razak were all clipped at the end. Was I just unlucky or did others find this also."
3,"Quite good, for the time period","I remember watching a few episodes of this on TV when I was ,maybe seven or eight, and I loved it immensely. It's not something you should go out of your way to buy, its really very unrealistic when you look at it again as an adult, but of course ,it was a childrens animated show, so you shouldnt be surprised that they never die, even when Rico is alone and unarmed in an entire bunker full of the oddly slow and stupid warrior bugs, who for some reason can charge across a field like a hydrocephalic cheeta, but always slow down and stay to snap at things up close.Anyway, the animation is actually very good givin how old it is, (only seven years actually, but thats ancient for something made with computers)"
5,Great item,"I already saw most of the videos on VHS, but I wanted to have an all-DVD version. I'm very happy with this collection."
5,Roughnecks - The Starship Troopers Chronicles - The Complete Campaigns,"Fantastic, beat the movies any day.."
4,Roughnecks--An OK series,"Three-D animation, good bugs, fair voice acting, so-so story lines... In all, taken for what they are, a good set of entertainment videos. Sort of a ""Band of Brothers"" set in the future.The series of disks follow Rakzak's Roughnecks in their battles against the bugs. The only resemblance to the original book is in the character names. If you ignore that, and take the stories for what they are, you'll enjoy the set."
4,Starship Troopers,Standard good vs evil. The series preys on the inborn fear of 'bugs. your are asked is our tech the only workable kind or are there other techs outthere. The animation for the period is good. The story line is consistant.
4,New Pokeworld To Explore!,"I haven't read this one yet, but since the Johto Journeys haven't made it to VHS and/or DVD yet, I'll give this book a whirl.Heroic Ash Ketchum, Misty and Brock, plus Togepi and Princess Poliwag (from Stun Spore Syndrome in the Orange League Saga), and Mr. 25 himself, Pikachu boldly go where no trainers have gone before! I'll write a follow up as soon as I get my hands on it."
4,VERY USEFUL,"As a person that works adapting material that has already been written for teaching on a classroom, I found this book very consice and to the point.I would recommend it to anyone who is starting on the world of teaching on-line."
3,The Raid,"Set in Manchuria in the early 1930's, a small army is controlled by an emperor in exile, forced to this far corner of China by invading Imperial Japan. Dr. Cho is a skilled medicine man who discovers a plot to manufacture poison gas, and is forced to help a group of rebels try and destroy the factory where it is produced.The movie is a comedy, with frequent action sequences involving furious gun battles and explosions. It is fun and exciting, even if it does almost resemble the Three Stooges at times."
3,"isn't a snap, but after a little calibration works just fine","I bought this thinking that it would be an easy way to label some burnt CDRs. Calibration?? Yea, that's right - you have to calibrate your printer before using this, otherwise your pictures/text will be off center. This was a little discouraging because I just wanted to install the software and start printing. It took about 10 minutes to calibrate the printer so that it would work with my printer (an epson 777), but now it works just fine. It's great burning CDs and labeling them for friends; even though they don't look professional, they look a whole lot better than just the blank CDR with the company's name on it. This kit is a great deal."
2,"Some OK, some not","This kit is not as easy to use as one would like, the software can be maddeningly obtuse, but that's not unusual. The lables are good, the applicator works just as advertised. To me, the software adds more to the price than it is worth, especially since better programs are often included with CD burners."
3,"Nice labeling system, weak software","This is a complete package with everything you need to create a CD label and a jewel case. It is fairly easy to use and the variety pack of labels lets you decide which labels you like before buying them in bulk. Unfortunately, the software is very buggy and the help system is shallow. The software has many impressive options but few of them work well. Images often show up on the screen differently than they actually print. The CD labels are too thin to cover existing marks on the CD, but they print well and don't smudge or jam the printer."
1,Piece of Junk,"This software is a mess. I bought it for the ""fingerprint"" capability which is suppossed to be abel to identify audio tracks and supply title and artist info. It is not good. It identified about 85% of the tracks I tried, but the information is supplied field by field. That is, track number, title, artist, duration, etc. are each supplied separately and have to be placed on the label separately, with minimal formatting options. Is some cases I couldn't even get them all on the label.I would recommend that you look at other packages."
5,this is great!,"I thought this was great.. And people act like it is sssssssoooooo hard to calibrate you computer! #1 I didn`t even have to calibrate mine so it shows that all printers don`t need ajustment. #2 It comes with nice labels but you`d better have a color printer or else they`ll come out in black and white (of course). #3 It may seem tough at first, but in the end it pays off. #4 There is great selection!"
1,1945-47,"If you're looking for Billie in her prime, look elsewhere. All the music on this CD was recorded between '45 and '47 after she had lost her voice. Look for the classic recording of Strange Fruit from '39 on one of the other CDs available."
5,Superb translation.,"Ovid in some ways the most important of the ancient Roman poets, as author of The Metamorphosis, the compendium of ancients myths well told and enjoyably readable. This is his volumes of ""love"" and ""romance guidance"" poems brought together and make excellent and enjoyable reading."
2,Don't buy Kindle version,"Like others I have noted that the software doesn't work anymore that comes with the book. Also, I can't understand why they sell a kindle version, when the software obviously would not be provided. I could not find the author's e-mail address so I could not request an alternate software program."
3,Good Book with Outdated Software,"The good news is that this book is very nicely done, providing a useful foundation to beginner and intermediate options traders. I found that I learned quite a lot about the interactions between option pricing and the various factors influencing pricing. The author provides numerous case study examples utilizing the OP-EVAL(TM) software included with the book. A majority of the book contains detailed examples describing how to use the software and interpret the output. The bad news is that the software will not run on current Windows operating systems (Windows 98 or newer). So don't buy the book if you want to try the software on your own. Efforts to contact the author, through the publisher McGraw-Hill, about the possibility of updating the software, have been unsuccessful. Otherwise a good book."
1,Book based on poor software,"This book is based largely on a software package which comes with it. The software allows only one install. If you have to reformat your hard drive (happens to me) chuck the whole works. They want more $$ for a replacement program than the book costs. If you must buy it, copy the diskette before install. There is no warning. Software is for European Options, not American. You can get better freeware. I regard this as highly amateurish, and feel really ripped off. The book itself is ok, but worthless if you lose the software."
2,Software Will Not Install on Windows 98,"I was eager to use the software that came with this book, but since my PC runs on Windows 98, it will not install. They should update the software so it will run on later versions of Windows before they sell the book again, or least ask you what version of Windows you are using before you place the order."
4,excellent,This is a great product and at a low price. I highly recommend it. I hardly ever cut myself even when I switch on a new blade.
1,Ouch!!!,"These razor blades are painful. I ended up with 4 cuts the first time I used them. They don't have any of the lubricating strips around the blade, and the blades are not as easy to use as the venus divine or embrace. Not buying them ever again."
2,"Meh, I'm going back to the low tech Schick Silk Effects","These razors dull very quickly compared to my Schick razors. I used to be able to shave my legs 3 - 4 times with the Schick. The Venus blade kind of dies after two shaves and if you use it in the armpit area after the leg, it is rather uncomfortable."
2,are not the same,"long story short; these blades are complete low quality. i have no idea how ""blades"" dont work or how an item as universal such as razor blades can be of bad quality, but you have been warned"
4,Simple refill cartridge,"Sometimes you don't need anything fancy like attached soap strips or gel strips etc. Plus, these are cheaper since it has no extra frills."
3,Not as great as Venus Embrace,"I bought the Venus Embrace razor (the one with 5 blades) and LOVED it. I assumed it was the Venus razors (versus the Schick ones I had been using) that had made the difference, but the real difference turned out to be the number of blades. Going from a 5-blade razor to a 3-blade razor sucked! Though these ones are much, much less expensive, I find myself having to almost shave twice, going over spots the razor missed. Even after my shower I found spots the razor missed. I never had to worry about that with the Embrace.Also, I feel like the blades dull quicker. With the Embrace, I only had to change the blade about every month or so (shaving about 2-3x week) but this cartridge dulls much quicker than that.However, it is nice that any Venus blade fits all styles of razor handles."
4,"No cuts, mach 3 gets closer","I like the smooth feeling of the Mach 3, even if it is a masculine color. The Venus just doesn't get as close. Good on your knees, if you tend to nick yourself there. I'm sticking to the Mach 3 for a longer-lasting shave."
5,great,"These are great, cheaper then my big box store and unlike other reviews the blades are great and real not messed up like some say. Ive ordered these a number of times and never get anything but the best!!"
4,The only razor for women that crosses our threshold...,"...anybody (and especially a male) who shares their home with one (or more) women over the age of 13 has probably made this mistake when working from a shopping list: you see a woman's beauty product on your list, and then buy something close...but not *exactly* the listed item.Big mistake. I did this once with Venus cartridges, and paid a major price. You'd have thought I tried to import smallpox into the house when I showed up with what was considered an inferior off-brand.These are the only blades for women I'm allowed to bring home. Ever.I tried a new Venus on my face one time: very similar to theFusion cartridgesthat are my own choice for shaving."
4,Good Razor,"I won't claim that this is the most amazing razor out there, but it's a very good one. I've never had any problems with Knicks or cuts with these cartridges, and they have a nice moisture strip. If you want soft, smooth legs, this is a great razor."
3,Wear down very fast,They must be making these cheaper because they wear down in sharpness very quickly it seems. I like them though because they never cut my legs even when dull.
5,Great Deal,"These are quite a bit cheaper than the price at retailers near me, and they are the same product. You can expect exactly what you get from this product when you buy it in the store. It didn't seem any different."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I was very pleased with how fast I received my product, and what a great price I got !"
3,Not the best,There are definitely better razors out there. No moisture strip. Doesn't contour to your body. This is just your basic razor blade.
1,Dull,"The product arrived in a very timely fashion but, so far all the blades are dull. Not sure if this is Gillette's fault, bad batch or a reselling of B grade merchandise under the guise of A grade merchandise."
5,Great Razor For Women,I really like these razors/blades. I wish they were a tad bit cheaper...but they are worth the money when compared to the other razors out there.
3,this was purchased as a gift,This item was purchased as a gift for a family member. She has a Venus razor and asked for these refills.
5,Venus razor,Great price & service Ill be back when these run out. My wife loves these bladesand these are a great bargain
3,wondering if they are the same quality as at a store,these seem to not hold their edge as long as ones I got at the store. Could they be knockoffs? I'm disappointed in how long they are lasting me.
2,save your money and buy the good ones,"Might as well buy the disposables instead of wasting money on these ones. These don't have any of the nice lotion, soap, anything that goes on your skin after or before you shave like the other much nicer Venus cartridges."
4,Wife likes them and they are cheaper online.,"My wife likes these plain ones over the ones with moisture bars and the such. The fancier ones not only cost more but they are mostly useless when the moisture bar runs out, even if the blades are still sharp. Just use decent shaving lotion and you should have no problems with this razor. Sometimes simpler is better.I normally buy these at the store, but they were cheaper on amazon so I now purchase them here.I am giving it 4 stars, although it is better than the $18-22 price in stores, the $16 price on amazon is still way to high for the product. Although I can't say how much Gillette charges for companies to buy these, I would say $10 is a fair price."
4,daughter likes it,my youngest daughter likes this item. it kicks her out of a few programs but other than that she likes it.
5,Easy Link Smart Keys - The Wiggles and Barney,"I bought this for two small children, 3 and 5 years> They were able to use it very quickly after being shown once how to use it. They were able to navigate to their favorite, mom approved websites by themselves. They really love it."
3,Just as good as what I got at the archery store,"Trouble is, the Barnett quivers give me trouble, they break and fall off, maybe it's just me. BUT why pay a lot more for the same thing, so this was a good deal!"
3,"Good, but Uneven & Schizophrenic","There are some bright spots on this disc, but there's some real ""filler"" material, too. Some of it sounds more metal, some of it sounds more electronic.. first track in particular sounds out of place & doesn't represent the rest of the disc at all.Not as much in the way of cool riffs or solos when compared to the Shrapnel debut, although Medicated, Syncopated & Face Down are standouts in those areas.Singer is a downgrade from the debut disc as well.. this guy is really tough to understand and has one of those nightmarishly annoying vibratos.Not an awful disc or anything, just a bit uneven. It's one of those you re-arrange the track order on your iPod, putting the filler at the end of the list."
1,This book is really hard to understand !!!,When I bought this book I thought it would develop my interest in politics. Instead I found that this book does not make sense at all sometimes and assumes that the reader knows all the events it is talking about. I don't recommend this book at all !!
1,The weakest MCSE book I've ever seen,"This book is a fairly decent read, and it does cover a lot of VERY GENERAL information about the internet and IIS 3. It does, however, an extremely bad job of presenting material relevant to taking and passing the 70-077 exam. The days of IIS 3 are coming to an end so this book can, thankfully, soon slip into oblivion. There was a substantial shortage of material available for IIS 3, probably because of the amazing pace of IIS software version release from MS. This book was and is one of the very few on the subjects. If you are still wanting to go for the 077 exam, and want more than the on-line docs (really the best source on this one) you might try ""Internet Information Server 3 Administrator's Guide"" by Allen L. Wyatt - Prima Publishing. It's ""fluffy"" too, but even the fluff is more substantial."
2,A bit on the light side and lacking in information...,"I found this book to be a bit on the light side and lacking in information. This exam was the 11th that I have passed, but I feel that this book did not help me, although I love other Sybex books I have used. I much more prefered the Microsoft Press IIS 3.0 Study Guide."
1,**DON'T EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS BOOK FOR MCSE PREP!**,"This book will NOT help you pass the test. PERIOD. End of story. I took the test today and found everything I needed to know from printing the online docs, transcender, and hitting the braindump sites. Whole sections were never described in depth so I never fully understood WHY something was the way it was. About the sample questions at the end of every chapter, not ONE did I see on the test. If you're a beginner coming into IIS without any background, then this is an OK primer. But if you're looking to pass the actual exam, look elsewhere."
2,Alarmingly INadequate!,"Contrary to the publisher's claims, this book does NOT ""provide all the information you need to pass this challenging exam."" I passed the exam because I studied the online product documentation, not because I used this book. Chapters such as ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective Webmasters"" and ""Creating Compelling Content,"" while interesting, will NOT prepare you for this exam! Further, important topics, such as Index Server, are covered too lightly. If you can't locate a better book, use the online product documentation instead; it's less expensive and more effective. And good luck!"
2,"Introduction, not a study guide",This book covers ever aspect of IIS and Index Server but is so light on detail that you'd fail the exam by a large margin. I passed with a score of 897 but this was mainly because of the brain dumps and cram guides found elsewhere on the Net. Spend your hard earned cash on another book.
4,A great study guide for an awkward fact based exam,"This is a GREAT BOOK to go through once before the exam. Also, another great study review is the IIS3.0 exam simulation at www.mcpprep.com. Both together are almost a guaranteed PASS the first time and isn't this why you would buy the book in the first place!"
5,Excellent Preparation Guide,"MCSE IIS 3.0 book by Strebe and Perkins is the best and the only book you need to study for 70-077. Actually, this exam is one of the easiest to pass. Even though the book has more than necessary information to pass the exam, it is advisable to just go through the whole book once. The long portions on Dfs, Crystal reports and Web creation tools are not need for the exam but it is good to know. The exam mostly deals with NTFS security, virtual sever and directories and ODBC connectivity issues. I passed the exam within 10 days of starting with this book. May be I am just too conservative to give a perfect 10 rating for this book."
1,I second the motion...this book is horrible...,"I too am an MCSE, and this is by far the worst ""tech"" book ever. Fluff, fluff, fluff. Save yourself the money and agony this book will cause. The IIS online product documentation is all you need to learn IIS or pass the exam."
2,Very little help for the exam.,I found this study guide little help on the exam. Most of the chapter topics are not covered by the exam and those that are are woefully lacking in crucial details.
3,Overall a Fair book,"IIS 3.0 Study Guide is techically accurate and well written but if your purchasing strickly for the purpose of passing the exam your money would better spent on the Transcender practice test. I used Transcender, Braindumps and the online manual that ships IIS 3.0 and scored 960/1000 (easy test)."
4,Uplifting and Inspirational,I found Jennifer's book touching home in events concerning my own inner awareness. I have attended Jennifer's seminar and wish that I had more opportunity to spend time with her and learn how to get in touch with my inner self. Her book is uplifting and inspirational. It makes you aware of the true meaning of life.
3,out of date,"If this was 1995, I'd give this book five stars. It's an excellent, readable book on an important scientific topic. The trouble is that this second edition, which dates back to 1993, is now out of date. It came before some important tests of General Relativity (Gravity Probe B, Cassini-Huygens), and it also came before the discovery of the nonzero cosmological constant."
1,horrible shipping!!!!!,I got my package today and the battery looks used and has a huge crack exposing the cell!!!!! they have this thin box it cam in and looks like it was tossed around!!!
1,Sure don't last long,Purchased this battery less than two years ago and it is now dead. There is no warranty coverage from Amazon and the manufacturer will not cover the product even though it is advertised as a 3 year replacement warranty.
5,Arrived in perfect shape.,"Yep. Happy customer. Works well. Arrived charged...No dings in the packaging, and the packaging itself was thick reinforced cardboard.The battery has a carrying strap, so you don't even have to cut the box open, you just hoist it right out. The top plastic guard doubles as a stand to get it to the correct height (needed for my nissan sentra 06).Very happy."
5,great battery,"probably the best part i have bought for my 04 nissan sentra 1.8L.i got my car used and for the longest time couldn't figure out why my car wouldn't start on the first try every so often. still don't know why its the battery, but am thankful it fixed the problem anyways.UPDATE:turns out it didn't fix the problem entirely. it happens a lot less frequently. so far in the past month it has failed to start on the first try one time. which is a lot better than what seemed like every other day. still very happy with my purchase though."
1,Great Battery but Poor packaging,"I would rate the battery 5 stars but only gave 1 becaus of Amazon's packaging. They just drop the battery into a box and send it off. My original order arrived broken. The battery corners were cracked and the cells exposed. After speaking on the phone with them and explaining how the packaging was not sufficient, they sent another. This one arrived broken too, with cracked corners and the cells exposed. The packaging was the same as the first. After calling again, and re-iterating how the packaging is not good enough, they issued a refund and said they would forward the packaging issue up the management chain. Hopefully this gets fixed. Amazon is just throwing money away with poor packaging (of this item)."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY,"If I could give zero stars I would... I know its cheaper here, but this battery just died after 6 months of normal use. Amazon will not stand behind this product and will not accept returns. Optima will also not warranty from an unauthorized seller. Funny, they left that off the listing for this battery. I learned my lesson, so hopefully everyone reading this will learn theirs too without the loss of $$. Unacceptable business practice in my opinion. FAIL."
1,"Great battery, horrible shipping","2 batteries were completely destroyed during shipping, money was refunded, purchased one locally. Great battery.I gave 1 star because Amazon doesn't know how to package things correctly."
1,An expensive Vehicle Battery that DOES NOT work TWICE!,"I got this Battery first last July 2011. With barely six (6) months, 600 miles added on my mileage it stopped working, my car does not start, the OPTIMA Yellow Top DID NOT fulfill its ""reputation"" AS ADVERTISED/ expected. Borrowed a jumper charger, I was able to bring my car to Tustin Toyota and Tustin Midas-BOTH dealership and shop declared the battery was NOT GOOD or BAD. Thanks for you Amazon, a same battery type replacement was sent last January 2012. Last week of last month-August of this year, with barely 2,000 miles added, the same concern came up... My car does NOT start, that same battery was dead.I ended up doing the same thing ALL OVER AGAIN, but this time Amazon NO LONGER WANTED to send or refund me the purchase amount. SAD STORY."
5,Optima D35 Yellow Top,The Battery arrived as promised by the tracking Number in perfect condition. After installing in my SUV it starts faster than it did with the old battery. So far I am very pleased. Could not have made a better choice.
1,Outlasts it's warranty and that's about all it can do...,"Mine died after just about two years... couldn't bring it back to life. VERY unimpressed. My truck was having a tough time starting for the past six months and I was blaming everything else, but not the virtually new batteries - until they finally totally gave up after the car sat around for a month (while on a trickle charger), after that I couldn't keep them alive. I wouldn't recommend these..."
3,conditioner,clairol conditioner much better...high in price...did nothing for hair rather thick to put on and rinse..wld not buy again..hard to rinse out of hair
5,My favorite conditioner,"Works great, moisturizes well, and leaves my hair incredibly shiny. This is the only conditioner that works to detangle my long hair."
3,Disappointed,I thought this product would come in a tube and I would be able to use it more. It was a small packet and could be used only twice.
1,This is NOT diswasher safe as described,I ordered this for my parents as a Christmas gift solely because it said it was both nonstick and dishwasher safe. I just found out from them that the instructions that came with the cookware say DO NOT WASH in dishwasher because it will ruin anodized coating. These are not as advertised.
4,"Not the best, but outstanding for the price","I liked the first one so much I bought a second. These were about $15 each, shipped, and worth every penny. This knife is made in China, and is not the quality of a Victorinox or something similar, but is a good, solid knife. It had a decent edge when it arrived, and I improved it a little with my ceramic hones. Still not as sharp as my Victorinoxes, but plenty sharp. The handle is the same sort of comfortable, slip-free material as the more expensive knives. I'd have to say that the blade thickness is just right-- thick enough for stiffness, but not too heavy. It also has just a little flex in it, if you like that sort of thing. If you need a good knife on a budget, try this one!"
4,What a breath of fresh air from radio pop,"Matt Marque's record ""get there"" is a very good CD. I recieved a copy from a representative of his record label (truckstop) and immediately fell in love with it's simplistic yet effective approach to music. it relaxes me anytime i am needing relaxed."
1,Simply Awful,Poor Matt Marque. His voice is awful. What little talent he has cannot make up for the excrutiating off-key singing voice he has. I would rather listen to a cat being skinned alive.
5,I've Enjoyed BEULAH LAND for many years.,"I've read Lonny Coleman's BEULAH LAND series of three books three times. The first time in high schoo., again as a young adult, and for the third time just last week. I saw the movie when it came out as a mini series a long time ago. Today I finished the movie again. I found the movie follows the books closer than most movies do.True, it's no GONE WITH THE WIND, it's better. I can relate better to Sarah Kindrick than I can to Scarlett O'Hara. BEULAH LAND is a heartwarming saga that I recommend to anyone interested in a saga about the old south and Civil War."
4,"Southern Plantation Life, Before, During and After the Civil War","Enjoyed the movie. Good and entertainin about the civil war before and after and the futility of slavery and its aftermath as well as suffering of people post civil war. Particularly interesting were how people in the South viewed themselves, the glory of plantation life and slaves contributions in making it what it was. Also showed that although some slaves were freed, they really never were."
3,A bit boring,"The story line of Beulah Land is very predictable, and I found it boring. Did not watch the whole thing; lost interest. It does feature some great stars who performed well, however."
1,Beulah Land,I decided not to purchas this DVD because it does not have closed captioning (acccording to one of the reviewers)and I am hearing impaired. I would love to purchase it if and when cc is added.
2,Beulah Land,"BEULAH LAND is a pitiful excuse for a movie. Acting was fair but the story line was horrible. Partly due to the fact it kept jumping ahead seven years. This fact made it hard to keep tract of who was who. I love period movies but this was nothing more than a soap opera disguised as a mini series. Save your money on this one, it is nothing more than a cheap imitation of Gone With The Wind. Two thumbs down!"
5,Beulah Land,"This film kept very close to the book. Enjoyed very much. Great costumes and acting. I did think the leading lady was a bit to ""happy"" for all the tradgies she was faced with. And two of the ladies never seem to age at all through the years this was suppose to spand. Other wise fanastic movie."
1,almost hideous,"as everyone else seems to reveal: yes, this is very much a soap opera. what everyone else doesn't seem to reveal is that it is BAD soap opera. characters appear out of nowhere and disappear almost as quickly. most of the acting is almost laughable; lesley ann warren is the only actor who gives anything approaching a watchable performance.to be honest, i couldn't believe how bad this was."
5,"Well-done, well-acted!","Enjoyed this the first time around on TV years ago and again just recently. Well-acted by established stars Lesley Ann Warren, Michael Sarrazin, Don Johnson, Meredith Baxter, Dorian Harewood, et all. Plus a few up and coming players of that time such Jonathan Frakes and Madeleine Stowe. If you like sweeping civil war epics, check this one out!"
2,Beulah Land,Beulah Land was trite and very untrue to life. Lesley Ann Warren was clearly acting her role as a southern belle and the other actors were also miscasted.
1,Never worked,"I ordered this with high hopes. I was severely disappointed. This unit came with Metrocall service and after 2 weeks of doing everything humanly possible, and 4 hours online with customer service and everyone possible, I mailed it back today. This unit looked great and was a serious disappointment. Part of the problem is that you have 3 or more providers with each piece of equipment. 1)hardware 2)wireless service 3)software writers for hardware operation and programs. This just seems to be too many cooks in the kitchen. Everytime I had a problem, each would point fingers at the others. I, being the customer did not appreciate that and the attendant wasting of my time."
3,Call T-mobile to unlock the phone with other sim cards,You can call T-mobile to unlock the phone with other sim cards. Not sure if this costs anything though.
5,Best cleaning product,"I have been so pleased with my Swiffer Wet Jet Mop, that I was delighted to be able to purchase new Wet Jet Cleaning pads at such a good price. This is one of the best cleaning products I ever had."
5,Amazing,"I was having PH crash problems in my fish tank when we moved to a town with a different tap water supply...for some reason I couldn't get my goldfish water to maintain a PH above 6.4!!! My poor babies :( I tried every chemical known to man, and it's a miracle my fish survived. I finally found a website online that suggested coral as a PH buffer. I put about 1/4 c in a hanging mesh bag into the water and keep it there 24/7...and now the PH is 7.4. I have a 14.5 gallon tank. I heard that mixing the coral straight into the substrate causes nitrate issues down the road when it breaks down, which is why I keep it in a bag. I can't support whether that is true, but my method has worked just fine so far, and I've replaced it once in the last year. I highly suggest trying this if you have the same issue like me!"
4,Very Cool Children's Introduction To Maps,"Good reading for 3-8 yrs. This book wins big points for originality. It serves as a good tool for demonstrating how places relate to each other and exposes them to the concept of maps. They are very basic maps--landmarks only--combined with good illustrations, that make it so easy for children to comprehend."
5,Excellent introduction to the concept of maps,"This is a great book from the 'teaching the concept' point of view, but what it more it is beautiful (great art work) and sweet for little chidren, with each map introduced through teh eyes of an animal's travels."
5,A great Introduction to reading maps,My son and I read this when he was around 6. He learned a lot about maps and directions.Great book.
4,Great for teaching perspective,"This book is a great companion to Me on the Map. It's a nice lesson in perspective, illustrating that we all share the same space, but see it very differently. Short and sweet, it makes a good addition to teaching map/world skills."
4,Good for a 3 year old,I bought this book for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. I think he will grow into it over the next 6 months. I like the illustrations and the concept.
3,Instant Confidence...Instant if you follow the advice.,"I bought this book recently, which also contains a CD. I thought it was a well researched book containing practical ways to self help which is always handy unless you are a person bubbling over with confidence already, in which case this book is not for you!!! A lot of what Paul is saying is commonsense but none-the-less I feel sure that it is worth it's money. From Meryl Heasman (songwriter) CATFLAP MUSIC."
3,An English reviewer,"Pay no attention to the vitriol of the reviewer below. McKenna won his court case against claims that he knowingly bought his doctorate from a disreputable university. He also won a previous case brought against him. And if you have Sky TV, he is on TV over the last year with shows about confidence, fat loss etc. His reputation in the UK is pretty good."
3,Different versions?,"Three stars. The version of the book I received is different than the one pictured. One of the reasons I ordered this book was because a previous reviewer commented about a stirring rendition of Silver Bells, which wasn't included in the book I received. Also, the included CD is not useful for learning the songs. Its a nice CD for listening to harmonica Christmas songs, but it basically useless as a learning tool (fyi, I'm a beginning harmonica player).I still gave it three stars because the songs are fun and simple to learn. Even more advanced players can get a lot out of the cross harp versions."
4,Tape Review,I was plesently surprised by the information on the tape. Mr. Lorayne has a very different yet simple way for you to think about and remember people's names. It's a short tape but very succinct and he touches on possible questions you might have. I plan on listening to it a few more times and would definately recommend it to anyone!
1,Like a One-Joke Wonder,"Other than ""Actually hear the person's name,"" Harry Lorayne gives basically one suggestion for remembering names. It's a tidbit that, in all likelihood, most people have heard before and, disappointingly, it has yet to help me. Also, I located no advice in this audiobook for how improve one's recall of faces. I feel appalled that I spent $6 on this title."
2,Somehow disappointed,"I bought the book based on the reviews on the Amazon but was disappointed by the content of the book. The examples on the book are very limited and the author keeps referring his another book for further discussion. Since the book is short and the author uses his own short stories as examples, it is hard to learn the depth of writing a realistic dialogue and I found myself getting more from other editing books such as ""The First Five Pages."""
2,Very Little,I think all of his books are great for beginning writers. Not much help to one who has been in the business as long as I have. He does offer some great tips for newbies though.
1,Awful!,"I've bought two of these, and both split open. The most recent one started oozing gel after only a few days."
1,Dangerous?,I am still not able to use the wrist rest. It has a chemical smell that is overpowering. I have kept it over on a shelf unused for about a month now and it still has this nauseating odor. There are lots of vendors. Pick a different one.
1,GREAT -- for a day.,"I bought a couple of these because they were the simplest, most neutral design, and because they seemed comfortable ( (I use two, side by side, to create one long wrist rest). They seemed well made, so I thought when the first two fell apart in a couple weeks and started spewing silicon glunk all over the place that it must a fluke. So I got two more. Again, silicon glunk EVERYWHERE. Disgusting, disappointing, infuriating.Can't someone make one of these that doesn't fall apart? How hard can that be?"
2,great comfort - but fell apart quickly!,"sadly, the spandex cover came off on both sides so that the gummy gel touches my wrists - yuck! i had the same on in burgundy that lasted much longer prior to this one. i really like the gel wrist rest, but this one needs to last more than a few months."
3,Busted open after a few days,Fellowes used to make really good products. This particular one busted open after a few days because I tend to rest my elbow on it while in The Thinker position. DON'T PUT ANY WEIGHT ON THIS OR IT WILL CRACK OPEN AND SPEW GOO. As a wrist wrest it does the job. Just don't lean into it.
3,good; not excellent like it's predecessor,"Joshua W. Burton made the best review of this product. Let me briefly repeat his review.There was a prior product of the exact same product name, number, etc. That product is in the pictures. I give that product 5 stars. Very squishy, comfortable gel that has saved my wrists.However, here you are buying a different product. It is not the same! It feels like a soft styrofoam. The pressure on my wrists is a bit harder and focused on a smaller area. This product is okay but it is not excellent like the prior gel-based product."
2,Disappointing quality,"Full disclosure: I'm using this wrist rest as an elbow rest (I work on a laptop on a small desk). CLEARLY it's not designed for this purpose...if you're looking for actual wrist wrest, this thing is probably workable.Anyways, here's how it went down.3 days. Left side starts to pull apart. Goo starts leaking out. I grab some tape, wrap up the left side like a little mummy, and keep on using it.2 weeks. Right side starts doing the same. I ignore it.4 weeks. Goo is making it's way out the ends of the tape wraps on each side. Goo is getting on my elbows, forearms, and desk top. The good news is that it's easy to clean.8 weeks. So much goo has leaked out that the rest is no longer effective. I start looking for a new one.10 weeks. It's in a dumpster.Bottom line - To me, even if you use this for it's intended purpose it WILL fall apart and leak at some point. If your expectation is to get a new rest every few months (maybe every year?), this is probably fine."
3,Is what it is.,"It's a wrist rest. Judging by other reviews before I bought this, I thought it was going to miraculously remove all my wrist and shoulder irritation, but it's really just a soft, comfortable lump. Nice texture. Doesn't stick or make my wrists sweat like other wrist rests. Nothing special though."
5,the best,very well designed. seems like it will last for at least five years. i don't know why this doesn't have any less than five stars.
3,poorly manufactured,"In my experience, it was comfortable (good texture, soft padding) but quickly fell apart on me -- a tear was worn in the plastic seam and the gel leaked."
2,comfy but toxic!,"This product is definitely comfortable. I felt very cushioned when typing. However, the off-gassing from the product is atrocious! It made me physically sick every day I used it -- even after letting it air out for several days. Unfortunately, I will not use this product because of the toxic fumes it emits. If it is not bothersome to you, it is a pleasant-feeling product to consider."
3,Good Gel Wrist Rest,"Fellowes 91737 Gel Wrist Rest - Graphite/PlatinumThis wrist rest is very comfortable and it is soft and now my wrists have no more pain. The only complaint is when you take the wrist rest out of thee package it has a terrible odor and it take a few days to go away, if you do not mind the smell it is a great wrist rest. I have owned it for 3 days and the smell is still there but the smell us much less, so I have decided to keep it."
2,"Comfortable, but not very durable","I have used this product just over a year with no complaints. It has now begun to seperate, and leaking gooey sticky stuff onto my desk. I would have thought it would have lasted longer. It has been comfortable, just not as durable as I hoped."
3,Razors are damn expensive,"Its a good product, does the job, shaves my legs, duh. Razors in general are expensive so I can't criticize this product in particular, but man I hate buying razors. That havng been said, Venus razors are on the cheaper side (but still a set up from the multipack disposable razors) so they are the way to go for me."
4,It's a razor and it works,What to say about a razor? It's sharp and it cuts the hair! I like it and can recommend them. I have 3 of the Venus razors...one for each of our two bathrooms and one for travel...they all work great!
2,"They do the job, but not very softly","I bought these as replacement blades for my Venus Embrace because they were slightly cheaper than the Embrace replacements. I used one for a week or so and then went out and bought the Embrace replacements. These do the job, but it kind of hurts to shave with them-- they definitely aren't a gentle razor. I would recommend the Embrace razor instead."
3,Rehash of first book plus new missions,"New mission coverage is good, but the typo's and mistakes are many. On one page he repeats the same paragragh (talk about filler) -- buy it on sale to get the mission info, the rest you can get from his first book. Tables in back are incomplete."
2,Starcrud!,"Chances are you probably got this guide with the Starcraft BattleChest. Good for you, you didn't buy it! If you're considering buying it, don't waste your money. Go buy Age of Empires or something.The book features many errors. Not spelling errors, but serious errors that can badly misguide a novice Starcraft player. It cited the Corsair, the most over-powered single ""unit"" in the game, as ""incredibly weak."" Even worse, it offers strategies that are worth little more than a rock. The only plus side I can think of is those big maps. There is a statistics table of all the units in the back, but you can easily get those statistics online at one of Blizzard's web sites. Do not waste your time or money on this!"
2,An ok book which could have been a lot better,"Ok, so you bought brood wars did you? You want a strategy guide, do ya? Well my advice is don't buy this unless you want a walk through of its 30(about) levels. This is basically what the book consists of. The unit table for the new units; lurker, medic, etc...is good but it fails to mention cooldown times. The multiplayer section is everything but complete. Bottom Line: Save yourself the money and buy the game Tribes or something."
2,Campaigns ONLY,"I bought this book with the starcraft battle chest and I must say that this book is not very good. It is okay to use it for campaigns, but for custom games, it's horrible. Either the strategies are to basic, or they don't work. You'll find your self saying ""Wow, thank you captin obvious."" If you like to play capaigns, then you may want this book because it helps you a little bit. If you're like me and like to play custom games or have little intrests in campaigns, look elsewhere."
1,Falling StarCraft,"As far as helping you through the different levels of Brood War this book gets the job done and is written in the same style as his first StarCraft book. Farkas definately didn't earn his money writing this one. You get the distinct feeling that he played through the game and wrote down what he remembered in a weekend or he never played the game at all and wrote down what Blizzard's game designers told him. Based purely on the elements of what defines a well written book, this one falls flat on its face. How do you get so many spelling errors in a book today with spell-check and proof readers? Go to level C. Where? It's not even shown. The fine edge between winning and losing is found in the details, so where are the ""cool down"" times? Every chapter in the book contains these kind of mistakes and more. Buy the book to get you through Brood Wars but for no other reason. Lets hope he doesn't write a math or history book."
2,Helpful for ABSOLUTE beginners,"It seems apropriate that this book is included with the Battle Chest - the only person this book would truly help is someone who has never played StarCraft before. ""Tips"" from the author range from obvious to shaky to wildly erroneous; More often then once the author states that an ability does one thing when it really does something completely different. The maps of single player missions are helpful, but the overly general nature of the ""walkthroughs"" leaves much of the thinking to you.While people who are tenatively picking up SC:BW for the first time will appreciate having a book to hold their hand until they acquire a feel for the game, any regular SC player will tell you that the book's suggestions border on laughable. I use this book for the maps, but thats it; its a nice bonues with the Battle Chest, but not worth buying on its own."
3,Not so much.....,"I keep reading the wonderful reviews saying how great the Swiffer duster is. I have used this product off and on for a few years and would never consider using it as a sole method of dusting. I think it's great for in-between sprucing up but I find that after time, there is a film of dust left behind that is essentially ""stuck"" to the surface. On the granite countertop in my laundry room for example, I have been swiffering and it wasn't until I used a wet all purpose surface cleaner with a cleaning cloth that I noticed how much better and shinier it looked. It wasn't only a little nicer. It was dramatic. I'll still use a Swiffer to get hard to reach areas, door frames, etc. but glass surfaces, granite and anything that is shiny doesn't look it's best after a few months of only Swiffer. I really, truly wish I was wrong because cleaning could be so much easier, but experience has shown me otherwise."
1,Radiator,I purchase this radiator and no less than 2 months it started to give me trouble i had to patch it twice for leaks and it should be new I don't know whats the problem.. would never buy again..
5,radiator replacement.,"Had pretty much everything I needed. The only thing that was missing the radiator cap for the new one, which was fine because I just used my old one. First time I replaced a radiator ever..let alone in my car. The installment that came with it was a big help. Since put in everything runs great. Very pleased. :)"
4,Un album √† aprovoiser...,"Il m'a fallu quelques √©coutes pour d√©couvrir toute la richesse qu'il recelait! On est loin ici, des chansonnettes auxquelles nous habituait parfois Mireille Mathieu. De beaux textes et une voix qui les sert tr√®s bien,sans en mettre plus qu'iln'en faut. Prenez le temps de vous laisser charmer et c'est un album que vous r√©√©couterez avec toujours autant de plaisir."
2,expired too fast,"PURCHASED A CASE OF 12 BOXES ON MAY 15,2012. WHEN I WANTED TO MAKE HAMBURGERS IN DEC., I NOTICED THE FANTASTIC ALREADY EXPIRED IN SEPT. WHAT IS THE NORMAL SHELF LIFE? CAN'T ORDER BY THE CASE ANYMORE."
2,I would Highly recommend not buying these burgers.,"Hello,I have tasted many veggie burgers. Frozen and fresh.--Firstly .. These are A LOT of work to make. You have to use many dishes and boiling water. then you get your hands very dirty as well.Secondly. They taste ok. After cooking for a very long time, they turn out like just ok. Not great, not horrible. Just ok...Thirdly. I think the frozen burgers are FAR FAR FAR superior. I enjoy them so much more. AND no work!Lastly, NO RETURN POLICY.. YOU ARE STUCK WITH 12 BOXES Of these guys. if you don't like them..----In summary, I would not recommend buying these..Nothing against the company or anything, but they are just OK and it's A LOT of work..TAKE CARE."
3,Ok for everday uses,"I used this tape to hold gauze to what the medical field calls a stable wound. Which worked for that purpose however, if you are looking for a heavy duty hold this is not the tape as the adhesive does not provide a strong hold."
4,Great CD,"This is one fine CD. It has a high energy feel with a few nice blues shuffles thrown in and an excellent cover of T-Bone Walker's ""Cold, Cold Feeling."" Finis' smooth vocals are backed by a bunch of very talented musician. This is one of the best blues releases in 1998."
5,Glorious Journey by Charles Stanley,Difficult book to find now but great reading with a lot of info. Arrived in great cond.
2,hat,Unfortunately the hat didnt fit properly even with the velcro.and i felt that the hole for which the ponytail was to come out of was far too big. postage was far to over priced for such a light weight item.Sorry!!!!This product just wasnt for me. But thats the price you pay when you risk buying of the net.
3,Poor chinese construction,"These are necessary if you own a Shure guitarist wireless. They are the only replacement cords that fit. Based on the reviews here, and the fact that the one that came with my wireless only lasted 3 months, when I bought this I wrapped it from end to end with 3 layers of black plastic tape. That made it a lot stiffer, and so far it has lasted almost a year. It is starting to short out occasionally, but I hope to get 3 or 4 more months out of it before having to order another replacement. If you need one of these, do like I did and reinforce the entire cord with electrical tape from plug to plug, or you will be needing a replacement very quickly! I play bass and use mine three times a week at church, and at a few gigs in the past year."
2,Shure not so sure!,The cable started out fine but it began to loosen up quickly and soon had to be taped so the the connection would stay in the mic pack. I do not believe I would purchase another one of this type of cable from sure.
2,not good but have to have,"I agree with some of the other comments. This is a crummy product but if You have a a Shure PX wireless You have to have. My first one last probably 3 yrs, which by some comments that is very good. My second last just a few months. I am not pleased."
2,Seems to last only 40 gigs,"I'll be ordering my third. What am I going to do? It's the only cable that fits the unit. If you buy a Shure wireless system that uses this cable, you'll be stuck with a cable that just wears out and doesn't make proper contact anymore. I've had great success with Shure, but this cable needs some help!"
1,Don't get stuck with this...,"I received the 00R model last year and while it's a very cheap PDA, you get what you pay for. Royal barely supports their PDAs at all, not having released any OS or link upgrades in over a year, the things fall a part on you (my cover especially) and worst of all, despite what it says on the box, you can't install new software on it. There's no way!My advice, shell out 20 bucks more and get a real PDA, not this over-priced organizer."
1,"Horrid Product, Don't Even Accept as a Gift!","What a mess. Subject to breakdowns, can't use all the memory claimed in any reasonable way, no applications, no expectation of any applications, tiny individual note storage space of a few characters(no warning at limit), unbelievably poor support, long litany of complaints on Web bulletin boards (...), flimsy, faulty, embarassing product that is not of a quality that should be sold to the public."
2,"Was good for a while, but...","Initially, I really enjoyed using my DV3. But I didn't get the keyboard, and it was difficult suffering through the hunt-and-peck method of touch-screen writing. Although I wasn't unhappy with this product, it ended up dying out on me one day. I had only used it about 3-4 weeks before the PDA died and lost ALL my information -- there was no low-battery warning or anything of the sort, because if there were I would have changed batteries and not have had to throw it in the back of my drawer, where it still sits today."
1,Very Disappointing!,"In less than a week my DV3 lost all my data. I exchanged for a new DV3, and the lid broke off the next week. I kept it because I enjoyed using it and found it very helpful, but within a month the new one froze on me, loosing all my info again. I was using the DV3 correctly, not abusing it (I bought a padded case for it almost immediately) but there was evidently a fault somewhere. I can't take the chance of loosing my data again. I'm returning it and getting another brand."
1,The problem is about support,"I used a daVinci during 1 year, I think it's a good gadget, but it has a very big problem with support from Royal. The daVinci has a button to upload applications, but Royal hasn't released any SDK (Software Development Kit) in order to developers make programs. In other words, you won't found any program for this PDA, you're limited to the original apps."
5,Fun,"Lots of famous movie starts, in a crazy chase. Good moral, in a way, as the movie shows that the silliness people get into when they obsess over money."
4,Original Funniest Movie,My bf highly recommended this movie for me to watch. I think is funny and very original.
5,Better than the remake!,I didn't even know that Rat Race was a remake of this movie. The original was great!
5,It's a funny funny funny funny movie,"Think of a huge ensemble of the major comics of the day, throw in Spencer Tracy (in his last - a comical - role), situations that defy the imagination and you've got a great comedy. Never a dull moment and you get to see where some of the greats of the genre came from."
5,"""A CLASIC""","I bought this for my son. It was made many years before he was born. I can't understand anyone not loving this crazy wonderful adventure. All the starsare at their best, and most are gone now. Anyone who likes a good laugh and a ""G"" rating will love it. I hope anyone who has not seen it to takethat chance and enjoy the comedy that we rarely see any more, that is so crazy that we can enjoy it with our youngest and oldest family members. Hope Ihave not made this review too short, but I can't tell you how much you will love it once you see it."
4,OK for a classic,This movie is definitely a classic and has many of the famous comedians of the time acting or making brief cameos. Overall its a good movie but not the greatest movie
3,Not This One,"This is a shortened version of the movie. The original version released in 1963 was 193 minutes long. Granted it is overly long and can be a bit rambling. But as it included a great many of the top comedians of the time, in both starring and cameo appearances, it is priceless. Try to hold out for the 50th anniversary of the movie in 2013 when hopefully the original version will be released on DVD along with the hour long documentary about the movie with many of the surviving stars in the late 1990's."
3,Missing scenes and the wrong aspect ratio...,"I was pleased to see the release of this movie as it has always been a favorite. Upon viewing the DVD I was rather dissappointed. The Laserdisc Deluxe Box set was in the correct 2:55 screen ratio and had a run time close to the original. This DVD is cropped at 2:35 and is missing many of the scenes that were included in the LD set. Shame, shame MGM - you did it right for the LD and then dropped the ball on DVD..."
2,Uh oh! This Movie Has Been Sliced & Diced!,"""Mad World"" is one of my all-time favorite comedies...but this DVD left me somewhat dissapointed. I have been watching a VHS copy of this movie for years, and know every line by heart. But when I first watched this DVD, I quickly noticed that lines of dialogue, and even entire scenes are MISSING! When the movie was over, I discovered that all of these ""missing pieces"" are now located in the Out-takes section of the DVD. So...I guess the ""Whole Movie"" IS on the DVD...but not in one continuous piece. If you're not already familiar with the movie, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this DVD version. But it distracts me greatly when scenes I know by heart are now truncated or absent. I would not have bought this DVD if I had known that it was sliced up like this. On the brighter side, the bonus materials are quite interesting, especially the interviews with the surviving cast members."
4,"Stanley Kramer's ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World""","Spencer Tracey And A Cast Made Up Of ""Who's Who Of American Comedy"" Are Combined In This Wacky Chase Movie To End All Chase Movies...Tracey Is The Crafty Police Captian Who Is Following The Progress Of Various Money-Mad Citizens Out To Beat One Another In Discovering The Burried Hiding Place Of $350,000 In Stolen Money...Starring Spencer Tracey, Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, Sid Caesar, Mickey Rooney, Peter Falk, Jimmy Durante..."
4,Its a Mad Mad Mad World,"Very funny movie, good acting by Spencer Tracey.Teenagers would love it too. Has a great plot ,energetic with people running all over the place."
5,Excellent,"Definitely enjoyed this movie. The negative reviews are very dumb. Comedy films of today are garbage compared to this classic. I guess many people can not laugh at a film unless it has something nasty in it or uses the f word in it's jokes.Everyone was great in this picture. I particularly liked the Englishman, he was a riot. Ethel Merman was great too. Really the whole cast is very funny - you will love this movie!"
3,full uncut version please!,"Bill Renek is absolutely correct. Why is this great comedy not available in it's uncut version of 192 minutes? Especially now that it is available on Bluray! Bluray easily has the capacity to hold the entire 192 minutes of the movie plus loads of special features on just one disc. I see no reason whatsoever to present a Bluray version of this movie in edited form. I would like to buy the Bluray version, but I won't until it is released in it's uncut 192 minutes. The three star rating I used here is for the edited version. I would give an uncut, 192 minute version a full five stars."
5,GREAT REMAKE!,Great Blu-Ray Remaster of the last of the best of Slap-Stick Comedy. All of comedies funniest comedians from the last days of vaudeville to early television.
5,Excelente,"Es una pel√≠cula que en su d√≠a la vi en cinerama y todav√≠a perdura su frescura. Es divertida, bien interpretada y muy bien conservada la fotograf√≠a."
2,A Lavish Misfire,"""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" makes one yearn for the musical-collision antics of ""The Blues Brothers."" Stanley Kramer's lavish, incredibly overlong comedy strains to achieve an epic quality, but doesn't even come close. The best bit is a silent, restrained cameo by the Three Stooges. As a matter of fact, you're better off catching one of Moe, Larry and Curly's classic shorts."
3,Overblown Nonsense,"This is a long, long, LONG excursion into one slapstick situation after another. How they milked the plot of this movie into more than 2 and a half hours is just beyond me. A bunch of idiots trying to reach the treasure first. And it just goes on and on (AND ON!) with totally clownish trip-ups and hindrances as each bratty adult tries to beat the others. The hilarity of selfishness? The women in the movie are mostly loud, obnoxious and boorish - the henpecked men are not much better. This is a high-budget production with lots of big names, but finally the story is silly and basically boring beyond all the bluster. Come to think of it, this whole movie is just bluster. I fast-forwarded it slow enough to read what little dialogue there was through the last 20 minutes of endless car chases and the idiotic characters being themselves. This won't be a popular review. The only reason that I can come up with for why it's so well-loved is nostalgia."
2,It was good to see so many old/funny friends again but.....,"The movie had some great moments but they were far too few to support a 3-hour movie. It seemed to me that anything that had the slightest chance to be funny was just beaten to death until it went from funny to not-funny-any-more to pathetic. (There were a few exceptions. The director didn't try to improve on Jack Benny's perfectly timed, ""WELL..."") The movie came out when I was 17 years old. I took my girlfriend to see it. It is 2:00 in the morning now, I just finished watching the movie, and I feel like securing a private detective to find this girl I haven't seen in 35 years so I can apologize to her for taking her. Oh, never mind. I just remembered why I have better memories of the movie than it deserved: we saw it at a drive-in. What was three hours of almost boredom tonight had been 3 hours of bliss in 1964. (I'll give my girl 4 stars but leave the movie at 2 stars.)"
2,"It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad Movie!","Except for the scenes with Phil Silvers, this film is a mess. The late, great Spencer Tracy is wasted with a silly script that provides him with the opportunity to give the worst performance of his career. And most of Ethel Merman's scenes are where she is flashing her sizable girdle. Milton Berle's acting is too low key for his talents. . . and on and on it goes--for way too long."
3,corntrader19,"This is a good slapstick comedy with some of the greatest comedians of the first half of the 20th century. The only disappointment in this movie was the fact that my favorite comedian, Joe E. Brown, is on film for only 18 seconds. Other than that, it is a wonderful comedy."
5,One of the greatest classic comadies ever...it dosent get old over time!!,"I have been a fan of this film since I was young, I remember watching this with my family and laughing till it hurts and after all these years it's still great. Some old films get old over time but this film dose not. It's ahllarious from start to finish. The acting is the best and it dosent get better then this. Ethel Murmean is the best and all the other actors shine from begging to end. The story is pure classic it dosent get better then this. I wish they made more movies like this there is only a few other films like this example Rat Race. One of the best films ever made it tops my top 10 list of all time films. I highly recomand this film to anyone it's great."
5,how do I find it?,"how do I find it on video? does anyone sell it?Why is it so hard to buy a copy of a really really good movie, but there are a million copies for sale of bad movies?"
3,Not as complete as the VHS edition.,"The movie: Excellent! However... I couldn't wait for the DVD of this movie to come out so I could replace my out-of-print VHS copy. Unfortunately, I'll have to keep the tape, because the DVD cuts many scenes from the movie and then labels them as ""extra"" or ""deleted"" footage. These scenes are correctly placed within the movie itself on the VHS edition. It's a shame and I don't know why the movie had to be chopped up like that. As it is, I'm looking forward to burning my own DVD of the tape as soon as I can."
4,Umm Love The Picture! This Edition well probably not.,"I love this film an awful lot , i would like an edition with the cut scenes restored to the film like i have on my vhs version that would be nice i probably won't buy it until, because as i remember as kid watching the theaterical version it was missing something. so a couple of years ago when purchased the widecsreen with the extra scenes restore to film on vhs i was excited, it made me laugh so hard. i think mgm should do a two disc thing like the stargate and the abyss editions, that had both versions of the films in the case. it just make more sense to do that, you know,as i said. i would buy that edition , until then i will hold on to my dear vhs version of this classic which i love very much. this one film that you should'nt see unless it's in widescreen trust me.Highly Recommended Film Classic."
5,my all-time favorite movie!,"This is the best movie I've ever seen! When Jimmy Durante crashes his car; Milton Berle, Sid Ceasar, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, and Jonathan Winters stop to hear about his fortune in gold, which is buried near the Mexican border. The day now becomes a race, with everyone competing to get there in time by whatever means necessary. Along the way they meet just about everyone who was in comedy at the time, and half the fun is just picking everybody out. Even at 3 plus hours, there's not an ounce of fat to be found, and it even leaves you wanting more!"
5,It's great movie,"I had so good laugh, in the end it took few minutes.I barely could breath.If somebody has bad mood, it will disappear after few minutes"
3,2 stars off for deceptive advertising,"It's hard to find anything wrong with this movie, but Amazon's listed run time of 181 minutes is DISHONEST. Don't be fooled into thinking this is the new restored version you may have seen on Turner Classic Movies. This DVD is the older theatrical release and is over 20 minutes shorter than the restored version."
5,"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World",This is my favorite movie of all time! It is hilarious and has a cast of some of the greatest actors that ever lived.
5,Funny Funny Funny!,This is a great movie! I have enjoyed watching it since I was a kid and now to own it and watch it whenever I want : ) I love that it has so many old actors that are such funny comedians.
1,"It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad Movie","If you enjoy silly yelling in every single scene, then this is the movie for you. I had to turn it off right after the intermission at which time the DVD was thrown in the garbage.I was very disappointed."
4,"One of the greatest comedies of all time, but...","...what is this with MGM DVD? I have a tape of this wonderful movie that is the restored version, about 20 minutes longer. Why was this version not used for the DVD? Why not a 65mm copy? I guess we'll see this come out later as a ""Special Edition."" MGM has been doing this lately, the most recent example was ""The Greatest Story Ever Told."" Although created from a beautiful 65mm interpositive, it was advertised as ""restored"" but turned out to be the same old cut version with some additional music. I would think twice about purchasing any more of these classics from MGM. This film is excellent and we play it on a regular basis. I would have rated it five stars if it was not the cut version."
1,Blu-Ray missed a chance at glory - will pass until fixed,The blu-ray version checking in at 159 minutes misses over 20 minutes of footage that was available on VHS. What the blazes are they thinking except to make a cash grab for the upgrade and then another cash grab on the re-release for those who want the added footage? Cheap a$% ba$stards whomever put this out. Shame on them. Don't waste your time since you don't get anything that wasn't on DVD except a shortage of movie. Boo...hiss...and rotten tomatoes at the producers of this garbage version of an otherwise great movie.
3,"Clean transfer, but incomplete DVD edition","This DVD does not feature the full-length release of ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."" Instead, the DVD contains what is supposedly the ""Original 35mm Theatrical Version."" This, I believe, was also featured on an early VHS release of the film. That VHS version, released on CBSFOX Home Video, was not letterboxed.However, in 1995, MGM/UA Home Video released its 2-VHS Deluxe Letterbox Edition, which restored nearly 20 minutes of scenes. The video quality on those deleted scenes, however, is noticeably worse than the rest of the film. Even still, the presence of those scenes puts us that much closer to the original release of the film.As of 2010, the video quality has since been corrected, and this expanded edition of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" has been shown several times on Turner Classic Movies. I hope this edition will be released on DVD. This needs to be done out of respect for the film and for Stanley Kramer's contributions to cinema."
3,Too short,"This is not the entire cut of the film. The orginal full length uncut Cinerama version is only available on a now discontinued laserdisc. I guess this will do until it is finally released forcing one to repurchase the movie.However, it is one of the funniest movies ever made and worth a look even in its truncated version"
3,Watch that aspect ratio !!,"This is indeed a hilarious movie. However, be aware that this film on DVD is letterboxed at 2.55:1. Unless you have a widescreen television, this film will appear as a VERY NARROW BAND across your screen. It would have been feasible to compromise at 1.85:1 and still preserve much of the director's original vision. If you have a regular 36"" screen or smaller, you will have to get very ""up close and personal"" to view this film. Unfortunate."
5,Fun!!!!,This movie is one of my favorites. It has an amazing cast of characters with a great mix of screwball and intelligent comedy. It is one I can watch again and again and never tire of.
4,"Loved it as a teen, Loved it as a retiree","I saw this film the week it was released at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. The walls of the theater literally vibrated with the laughter. I watched it again last week on DVD, 44 years later, but laughed in the same spots. Plot? What plot - a bunch of wacky 50's & 60's comedians try to best each other on a treasure hunt. The lot of them thrown together is what the word ""Juxtaposition"" was invented for. Who would think of casting Ethel Merman, Terry Thomas, Spencer Tracy and the Three Stooges in the same film? But it works! Enjoy....bg"
5,Wonderful to Have this Movie,"It's been so long since this movie has been on TV and I have missed the Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. It's a movie that always makes me laugh and laugh. Most of the comics are gone so it's great to see them again and as many times as I want. My only regret was that I ordered the wide screen version when I don't like ""short stuff"" on my not great big TV. I didn't notice there was a choice. Still I'm glad to have the movie. I love that the old movies are becoming available."
5,"Its a mad, mad, mad, mad world",Great show. DVD quality is excellent. This movie is so funny and has so many famous people from the time period. I love it.
2,Disapointed in tape.,"I ordered the movie ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World on tape because it was supposed to have closed captions. The tape version was the closest to the original movie. it was a 2-tape set. My wife requires closed captions. Tape #1 was without closed captions. # 2 had it. The seller tried to make things right by sending another copy of tape #1. It too, was without closed captions. My wife and I have been wanting to see this movie in it's entirety for a long time. The DVD's are missing almost 30 minutes from the original. The tape are only missing 11 minutes from the original. My only chance to see the entire movie will be when it comes on TCM again, don't know when.... The problems were NOT the fault of the seller. rather the people who made the tapes. Thank you."
5,Great cast at their best,"What a treat to see the finest comedic talent that we will ever see together in a hilarious production. Each of these legendary performers are marvelous and none of them overact. There is no competition between them, but a wonderful blending of talent that is from the better days of entertainment."
3,They Didn't Get It Right,"What a bummer. For the DVD they should have used the wonderful 188 minute restored version that was released on Laserdisc and VHS in 1991. But NOOOOO, they stuck with that horrible 161 minute butchered version we had to suffer with for years. Go to Ebay. Look for the 188 minute version of this movie on Laserdisc or VHS and have a ball!"
3,Missing special features,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it. When christmas was beginning to roll around this year, I happened upon the DVD in my local suncoast. So I immediately added it to my wishlist. I ended up getting it for christmas, so I was happy. I open it up and pop it into my DVD player to inspect the special features. It's a one-sided DVD, yet the main menu says To Access Special Features Insert Other Side of Disc. What other side? The top of the disc has printing on it, it's not readable by a DVD player. I want my special features!Come on, MGM, the least you could do is put the friggin special features in the package... I loathe double sided DVDs, so preferably slap them on the same side of the disc as the movie, or include them on a separate disc. Now if I could take it back... or if this was a widespread problem and there was a recall... that would rock."
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","I am 13-years-old and I bought this movie without any idea what it was about. I saw the list of all the comedians in it and had to have it. I watched the movie and loved it. I read on IMDb that Buster Keaton had an extended scene, so I tried to watch the ""extended scenes"". I found out the hard way that most of the scenes are soundless or the film is messed up or something. Belive me, you're not missing much with the VHS."
5,I still love this movie,I remember watching this movie as a kid and still enjoy watching it today. It's one of my all time favoirites.
4,Great movie but incomplete,I recently puchased the DVD version. It is still funny and great as usual but I was disappointed that the presentation was of the 161 minute general release version and not of the longer version that was previouly available on VHS and Laser Disc. These had the overture and more scenes which when you are used to seeing these the DVD version becomes noticeably incomplete. Having these missing scenes in a special features section of the DVD still does not put them in their proper place in the film as a whole. Here's hoping that MGM will issue a new complete version as soon as the production run on the current version is sold.
1,part of a movie,"Doesn't have the full visual frame of the movie, doesn't have all of the movie- looks like about 45 minutes are missing. I'm pretty disappointed not to have gotten all of one of the greatest comedies of all time."
2,The Uncut 192 Minute Original Cinerama Release Version,"I see this is being released once again on Blu-Ray on February 7th, 2012 and don't know why...this states that this is the same time length as the original Blu-Ray release. We need to see the original, uncut Cinerama release version of 3 hours and 12 minutes finally to arrive for its 50th anniversary in 2013 and also incorporating the original poster artwork that was used in the MGM/UA double video cassette release."
2,One of the unfunniest comedies ever,"Seems Stanley Kramer's idea of comedy was to make something very big and very loud and not a bit funny. He should have let Blake Edwards direct, as he has had much better luck with this genre. The true travesty of this mess is to see the great Spencer Tracy lower himself this much. I guess he really needed the money. It's also quite sad to see real comic geniuses like Winters and Caesar stoop this low. This film really makes me want to cry!"
2,"It's a boring, boring, boring, boring movie",Having heard so much about this movie I was keen to watch it. It proved to be rather a disappointing experience. Whilst it might have been great for the 60s it falls short off what you might expect in the year 2000. I prefer witty comedy as opposed to slapstick and found the most disappointing part was the script. I was waiting for a funny line. I waited and waited and waited. I also found a lot of the action sequences repeated over and over again. Many weren't funny the first time and were really testing my endurance on the third time round.I suppose the movie was well summed up in the title. Make it long and repetative and hope people find it funny. Well I for one didn't.
1,brutal,"if you love yelling and screaming for 3 hours,this is the movie for you.for everyone else who has a brain,stay FAR away. it really is shocking what a big stiff this movie really is. and i thought Airport was the first disaster movie !"
2,"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World","This version of the film has been edited, leaving some of the nice little gags out, such as the man popping off Phil Silvers' steering wheel, and Mickey Rooney dumping water on Buddy Hackett in the airplane...suddenly the cut back to the scene, Buddy is wet but you don't know why if you haven't seen the uncut version before. This is not the version for the true fans of this flick. I don't understand why the company who transferred the film chose to cut out little funny scenes but kept the tedious intermission with it's blank screen and theme music...omitting this instead could have saved the original humour and flow of the film."
2,Disappointing,"Those expecting ""pure Feinstein"" doing ""pure Gershwin"" will be disappointed. Too many of the arrangements are a departure from the Gershwin standards that one expects from Mr. Feinstien. The lush orchestrations drown out Mr. Feinsetin attempts to sing, while others sound like a Latin American dancebeat for a basic dance class. S'Disappointing"
1,"He should stick w/PURE Gershwin; overmixed Gershwin, ugh!","I loved ""Pure Gershwin"" and the liner notes. I loved Feinstein's book. He, of all people, should be singing these songs the way Ira and George wrote them to be sung. ""Nice Work if You Can Get It"" is farther from that than ""Pure Gershwin"", and this ""Michael and George"" (who should be first here?) is TOO far for me. It's going to the used CD store. When Michael introduces George Gershwin on the player...too much. I'll listen to George play on my Duo-Art, instead."
2,"Love Feinstein, but...","While both Feinstein and Gershwin have attained holy status in my musical lexicon, this was kinda off the mark. Michael must have done intense research to unearth these obscure, probably very early Gershwin ditties. Not his best. There's so much else from which he could've chosen. Not what I expected, or loved."
2,Michael & George(Feinstein Sings Gershwin),I love this music and the way Michael Feinstein sings it BUT this recording has the piano music over shadowing Michaels voice...there were points that I could not understand/hear the words.
1,Ghastly,"Feinstein manages to make even the best songs sound awful. His appalling voice defies description. It manages to be deeply sentimental and smirky at the same time. There is not a moment of real emotion on this album, just track after track of foul self-congratulation."
1,Feinstein has lost touch...,"As a musician I appreciate Feinstein's ""carrying the torch"" if you will for this genre if music. This CD has pretty well soured me on his more recent work. After ""Forever"" he seemed to make some fundamental changes to his approach and performance of this style of music. For my tastes, it's not working like his earlier releases did. Too much production, odd interpretations, and a sense of trying things almost for the sake of trying them... When Feinstein is on his game, he's likely the best going, but lately he's not ""got game""...spend your money on a Harry Connick,Jr. CD...you'll have a lot more fun..."
3,Award Winning Musicality at its Best!,"This award-winning album of Gershwin songs is not your standard Feinstein balladeering. He is a master at interpreting these wonderful, old standards. If only he had included my favorite Gershwin, BUT NOT FOR ME; that would have capped it off and made it the most special."
2,Going back to the store -,"I got this TV at another place. I paid just less than $600 for it. Yes, it is the exact same model number!However, the picture is not good. It has the capability of showing the ""specifications"" in the menu section. It shows clearly that I have a resolution of 720 x 240 rather than the 1280 x 720 it should have. My old TV, about 8 years old, had a great picture. The same connection is on the new TV, there is no reason for the poor quality.I could not get the PIP to work either. Additionally, I had to delete the non used channels one at a time, could not get the ""scan"" to work either.I am debating a ""swap"" or paying more for a more known brand."
2,Poor quality of the psuedo stereo mix,I would advise bobby darin fans to stay away from this cd. The conversion from the original mono to psuedo stereo is very poor. It has removed all the excitement from what were a few great rock and roll tracks in mono. I have the original bullmoose on 78 and this is better than this cd version.
1,An unusual low rating for me,"Outside of the well-known hits, I found nothing of interest on this album. I listened to it once, and that was it. Your mileage may vary, of course."
5,"Great collection, a must for RRK fans.","The first album included in this 3-album compilation alone is worth the price of the whole package. The Return of The 5000 lb. Man is a masterpiece - his rendition of Goodbye Porkpie Hat is as good as the Mingus version, and Theme For The Eulipians is like nothing else."
2,The Da Vinci Papers,"I was actually a little disappointed with this book after all the buzz. The prose was simple and straightforward, the story a fantasy and the conclusion a little boring.I know a lot of people like this book but I'm left a little confused wondering why it was written in the first place."
3,Nice Pictures-Silly Story,"The visuals were great--soft colors, cute animals, but I did not like introducing the idea of hanging onto parents legs and having them stay in kindergarten and fully participate in the children's activities. It was an unrealistic expectation. Kindergarteners are now entering the real world of big school and should be made more aware of what they can truly expect. I found that to be true in ""'Twas the Night Before Kindergarten"" and ""When You Go To Kindergarten"". This may be a cute story for younger children but not as a preparation for real school."
2,patriot trap,Better proofreader is needed. Too many typos! Couldn't get into story as mind kept processing the typos instead of concentrating on the story line.
2,Automotive parts RAPE,"It's a sad situation when a supposed ""great"" seller like Amazon advertises a part for 2 1/2 times what it can be found for if you just look around a little more thouroughly and use your brain for something beside a lint filter. Open your eyes and avoid AUTOMOTIVE PARTS RAPE!!!!!"
5,Works great on my Porsche,"I spliced this into the stock porsche wiring on my 987.1 Cayman. I was even able to get the horns mounted in the right location.These are the exact euro sound I was looking for and they are plenty loud enough on the stock wiring. If i had more room in the front, I would've used a relay and wired it to the battery."
3,Quieter than Expected,"I ordered these to replace my fried factory horn. The horn(s) sound fantastic and mounting and wiring was a breeze. The 115dB rating seems to be right at the exit of the horn though, so it's not as loud as you may think. I haven't had to use it for any 'emergency' purpose yet, so I'm unsure how other drivers will react to it."
4,In response to the last review,Very impt. The 1101 does not have SSB receiving capability.The 1102 does.So in that regard it is a very different radio for those who want to hear Ham radio.
1,Could not pick up any Shortwave,All hours of day and night could not pick up any SW radio. Even went to ther side of state and tried. No luck. Went and got shortwave listings and put in. still nothing. Had to return this Item to Amazon.
4,"Very nice, full-featured portable radio","Bought this radio last month in order to listen to music and talk radio in my office. I needed something that could pick up signals through several thick interior walls, and still take to the beach and on ski trips.When I got the radio, I was surprised at how small it is (about the size of 2 cassette tapes or decks of cards), but was pleased by the heft. Directions were a bit confusing at first, but not the worst I've seen.AM/FM Reception is quite good. It's better than the Eton 300 I picked up at LLBean (and lost), bettern than the $10 Jwin I bought at Walmart, and almost as good as the much, much larger Emerson MBR1 I have at home. SW reception is better than the Eton, but I haven't used that feature much. Signal doesn't seem to drift. I unplugged the radio yesterday at noon, left it on overnight, and it's still running on the same charge 20+ hours later.All in all, this is a very good, very portable radio."
2,"When it works, it's great. Mine DOA after few days","I wanted to like this radio. The reception is very good, especially AM radio. Speaker is very loud which is nice. Using the AC adapter to charge the batteries never seemed to work. I tried to tell it to charge for 5 hours like the manual said and 5 hours later, I'd use it and the batteries would die. Even charging the batters in an external charger, the battery life meter on the radio never read they were full. I don't know if the charging problem is related but after 4-5 days, the radio died completely. It felt like it still got warm near the battery compartment when plugged into the AC adapter, so maybe there's a short somewhere. If it was reliable, I'd keep it but now I'm a little hesitant in case there's QC issues."
3,For the completist only,"The best thing I can say about this disc is that it proves even early on that Frank was a decent orchestral composer.And if you've ever wanted a picture of the Mothers when Henry Vestine was in the band, it's here."
2,"Is This PHASE ONE of the ""Lost Episodes""? Yes","This CD compiles the tracks from the two vinyl ""Mystery Disc"" releases that were, once upon a time, part of the first two ""Old Masters"" boxed sets. The casual FZ fan may not find these interesting, but for the FZ fanatics who care about historical FZ recordings, ""Mystery Disc"" (and ""The Lost Episodes"") offer up a slew of oddities that will enhance your FZ collection, and even provide more ""conceptual continuity clues"". Although a few tracks are repeated on ""Lost Episodes"", I find both titles necessary for my Zappa collection. Unlike ""Lost Episodes"" which compiles assorted recordings from 1958-1980, ""Mystery Disc"" features tracks from 1963-1969, with one spoken track from 1972, which features Frank interviewing two females about ""The Story Of Willie The Pimp"". I'm thinking that this is not a good starting point for the newbie FZ listener."
3,slophouse zappa platter,"This mixed bag offering is hardly essential listening and is really for the hardcore fz diehard completists. A large portion of the material is available on other albums, most notably the chunks of the play from ahead of their time. Some highlights include speed freak boogie , original duke of prunes and how could i be such a fool. If you like your zappa raw, buy this. For juicier cuts , look elsewhere."
3,The meek should not inherit this disk,"This disk is only for the well informed zappa fanatic. I just bought it, and I'm listening to it now. It seems as though Frank lived a life similar to the Truman show. Was every second of his life recorded? Dont expect a great guitar solo or Dukes wonderful vocal or keyboard work this is raw zappa"
4,Good for What it was Bought For,"First off I bought these speakers to go with my PS2 and PC. I have a Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 card and the sound is crisp. Also Creative Labs sends you everthing you would need to connect you sound system to your devices (TV/PC), whether you are going for an at home theater or PC Desktop. The only problems I found with the system is that the satelites do not push enough volume and are really over powered by the center channel. And also the chords for the rear speakers aren't quite as long as I needed them to be. All in all, however, I found the system to work very well."
1,"Wow, can you say ""Crap!""","These are the worst computer speakers on the market. When turned up, not even high, these speakers sound like a tin garbage can being smashed against a brick wall. I fyou buy these you would have to be completely idiotic. Smelling my old dirty sicks is more fun than listening to these. The DTT3500s are really lousy speakers, not only for the price, but overall."
4,Tropics Palm Tree Fabric Shower Curtain,I bought this as a gift for someone who Loves this look.....The quality was great and the print was tropical but not HOKIE.....It is a nice choice if you are going Hawaiian
5,Troy-Bilt 2BAF572B766 5.5 HP 27 Ton Log Splitter,"I purchased trhs splitter to split firewood for myself and my family members. After researching on the internet, checking out a couple at local dealers, and trying out a homemade splitter, I ended up with this one. The price of this brand name splitter compared well to unheard of brands. I really like the ability to use it in a verticle or horizontal position. The 27 ton capacity is more than adequare for the average user. I have split approximately 15 cords of wood cosisting of maple, black cherry, hickory, basswood, and pine. This machine handled it all with ease, even when splitting a crotch. The Honda engine starts great and is QUIET. I would have preferred that it had a larger fuel tank, but I can live with this. Also, if I were going to tow it long distances or very often, I would like to see larger tires on it. All in all, it is a compact, powerful, well built unit that can be stored easily. I would recommend this splitter."
1,silence,"I am a skeptical professional scientist looking for alternate views on how science should be conducted. This book is a joke, and a short one with big margins, that isn't funny. It may be valuable if you are considering writing a book and want to feel encouraged by how bad you can be and still get published. The authors get close to some significant worries about the misuse of science, but come nowhere near capturing our interest, preoccupied as they are with getting the 59 pages written. It took me an hour to read; it can't have taken them more than a weekend to write. We'd love to silence bad science, but would settle for silencing charlatans like these two."
1,Pure propoganda,"The authors try to smear everyone they disagree with, while at the same claimng that ""their side"" is being smeared. Overall, leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. If you are interested in a well researched look at politicians interference in science read Todd Wilkinson's Science nder Siege."
1,misleading,The authors are hypocritical. This is a bad example of critical analysis of scientific work. It is more political trash than a serious attempt to address problems with scientific research. Don't even bother reading it.
5,the best,"is this the 5th book? ahh!!!this series is one of many mangas made by the great Yuu Watase. Once you pick it up, you can't stop reading it! this story's filled with romance, comedy, and many more. All the essential needs in a masterpiece like this!"
2,not a lot of thought went into this product,"I'm a touch typer and have no need to look at the keys while typing; nevertheless, when inputting special software keys (requiring the control, alt, etc. keys) I - like everyone else - must look at the keyboard. It is at this point that the stupidity of this product becomes evident. There is nothing gained by leaving off the key labels, but it is a major problem when you need to use some combination requiring moving your hands from the standard ""asdf ;lkj"" position.I've had to use a paint stick to label certain keys, but the paint comes off quickly. Mechanically the keyboard is fine, but the lack of key identifiers makes this a poor choice for PC users (i.e., 99+% of intended customers)."
5,The missing CD,I have this album on vinyl and love it. But I have had it on my wishlist hoping to get it on cd. Is it available or not? Why is it so difficult to locate? The album is comprised mainly of Motown ballards done ala Smokey. Very romantic and vert soothing.
5,very good cd,"this cd need to go back in print .. it is a great album, and i remember it as a little boy. i think that it would really sell. we as music lovers need to do all we can to see about getting this back in print"
1,New Credit File is Illegal!,"The information that this book contains is very illegal. I should know... I owned a small mail order company and we sold a book with the exact same information as this one and the FBI is now in the process of sending me to prison simply because I sold this information.Don't Buy It - Don't Sell It, Trust me, write to me, ask me....This information destroyed my whole families life... Dont have the FBI come to your home and take away all that you have, then all that you will ever have. Don't Buy It - Don't Sell It - Please for the sake of your entire life."
1,Questionable thinking,"First of all, this book has very few writing samples. The author describes the handwriting rather than using a graphic. Secondly, she comes to conclusions about the person's physical appearance through her analyses, and that makes the book smack of racism. She also editorializes on morals, etc. I don't really care for this book and wouldn't recommend it."
3,Good,"Hello, I bought this for my husband, and he said it's a good guiro for the price I paid. O and it has a good size not too small nor too big"
3,Not bad.,"This CD offers some electonic as well as some pop mixed into it. Nothing too catchy. This won't grab your attention much. A nice try, but it just doesn't get there. I gave it 3 stars - if you are into electronic music, I would suggest this CD. If you are more of a pop person - I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Not worth the plastic it is written on!,"I bought this album with very high expectations of some classic electronic tunes and dance type music. However, I was very disapointed at what I heard. The title track ""King of my castle"" Has very little going for it, it is too slow, the vocals are too sparce and the computer digitalised sounds are a cheap effort at class which does not succeed. The rest of the album follows in simmilar fashion which left me almost at a loss to describe this junk. I returned the CD within 12 hours of purchasing it."
5,A Great Read,A gret read that will be a blessing to any who chose to spend a few minutes having their thought lifted heavenward!
2,looks like second hand to me,"I have the impression that the product was second hand although I though I bought a new! I can read the book, so am happy I guessEnergy Risk: Valuing and Managing Energy Derivatives"
1,I didn't like it at all,"I have read other's review on this book, and then purchased the book. Though it contains some useful stories, the book lacks of anything really useful. Lots of comments, math, model without any proof and/or reference. I really wasted my money, and time to read the book witch contains virtually no information."
3,ok but not a reference book,"Quantitative-oriented type of book but real quants will probably find it a bit ""light"".The first chapters are supposed to give some background on power, nat gas and oil markets, but there is not much interesting content, which can be summarised like this :""volatility may be very volatile, especially on power, and spot and forward contracts are at best loosely correlated"". So nothing really new / interesting unless you are really new to the energy business.That said, the author proposes an interesting commodity model in the following chapter, and some indsight on model building and validation. Worth a read, but far from a reference book. I would recommend it for a new manager that wants some quick background / crash course on commodity models, to help in discussions with quants and traders."
4,"Handy source for punks, artists, activists, and funsters.","This is a large book with an admirable variety of designs. Especially handy for photocopying--for cutting and pasting the old fashioned way! Great for zines, party invites, announcements, flyers, and so on.The book has a nice variety of designs from sports to animals to tech objects, and so on. It's main drawback is that most of the designs are older ones. So, for example--you can work with a funky old bicycle design, but nothing from a recent decade.Still, these designs completely spice up nearly anything you're working on. I thought it was worth fifteen bucks."
3,A Few Good Pics,"This book of clip art was very interesting. I was looking for images to use for screen printing and there were a few usable pictures. Most would be very good for ads or flyers, but not really for screened reproductions. Interesting book. It showed up quickly and in very good condition. Thanks."
4,I'm using almost every picture in this book,"All of the Dover books seem to have been drawn in the post-Victorian age, but the pictures are still usable and I am making due. A little more modern stuff would be great, Dover!I'll buy from this seller again"
2,Not what I expected,"I had no idea that these images were all very old, and therefore there is not a single modern item in the book. We were looking for clip art so we could look at it to draw everyday objects, vehicles, etc. but all of the images in this book are from about 100 years ago. I wish that had been made clear before we bought it."
3,The tale of three kings,"This book was very insightful in regard to dealing with ministries hurt, pains and woes. It also discussed the many ways one can stay channeled to Gods direction for your life plan in ministry."
4,Powerful quick read!,Enjoyed the Biblical perspective on how to respond to God's authority in your life. Highly recommend this book to those who find themselves stuggling with how to respond to an unjust authority.
4,"Very funny follow-up to ""Elephant Parts""...","Back in 1980, former Monkees member Micheal Nesmith had a great idea-- to do a ""video album"" of songs and sketches; that idea became 1981's ""Elephant Parts"" the first video release to win a ""Video Of The Year"" Grammy. Several years after the success of that Video, Nesmith and director William Dear were approached to do a summer replacement series, NBC TV's 1986 ""Television Parts."" This tape, ""Television Parts Home Companion"" is a short (40 min) compilation from several of those episodes. It's very funny, but the ""Dr. Duck's Super-Secret All-Purpose Sauce"" compilation of those same shows from 1987 is much better."
1,Don't believe the date on this,"This CD looks like some remastered early work - it has a 1999 date on it. As much as I'd like to see Lou Ann get the money, these importers have pulled a fast one on us. These are basement recordings of outtakes and not very well composed. She has much tighter, high tech versions of several of these songs on ""Read My Lips."""
4,The good old days!,"This was bought for my mum! And she told me:""Robert and Elizabeth"" brought back happy memories of a lively and excellent show, some memorable songs and a stirring love story, especially because it was true. After my recent hideous encounters with certain films running in the cinema (best not mentioned!), it is reassuring to recall something entertaining which did not need horror comic effects to make an impact."
5,I've Tasted Bayou Water Too,"Maurine Bergerie was one of my high school teachers, an interesting person and a great educator. In They Tasted Bayou Water, she provides a brief history of Iberia Parish which began with the Settlement of New Iberia in 1779 by the Spanish. Louisiana was under Spanish control from 1763-1803 although administration began in 1768. The Spanish soldiers were joined by settlers from the Canary Islands. Ms. Bergerie captures the spirit of the people and her love of Iberia Parish can be seen throughout the book."
3,Euro-Pro #2 just died...,"I bought my first Euro-Pro mix Nov 2005. I LOVED it! I had never had a stand mixer before. It was great for cooking with my daughter. I hand mixer popped off the stand so easily. The blades didn't touch the bottom of the bowl. As others noted about the blades bending, my daughter was mixing something simple like a cake mix and the blades wigged out. I ordered new blades, but the mixer never did work again. So, I ordered another about a year later thinking that was a flux. As soon as I received the second one the motor sounded labored. I should have returned it right away. The second one last about 18 mos and died. My husband won't let me get another one. So, I bought a reburished KitchenAid which works great but it is heavy."
2,"looks great, but...","This mixer looks great and had great reviews. But, I have to say that this is a REALLY low end product that does not deliver good performance. I thought I was getting a sturdy mixer, but it turned out to be a very light duty appliance. The low setting doesn't really work at all and the high settings don't respond to a regulated speed. After about a minute of mixing, it just stops - you have to shake it to keep it going. At that point, I got my old hand mixer out of the drawer to finish the job. This is not an appliance with which to form a long term relationship. Actually, you'd be better off not to form a relationship with it at all. You'll just have to go spend more money on something that really works. I used it only about a dozen times on light-weight mixing jobs, nothing heavy, and this was my experience. Save your $$ for the big guys that really work."
1,junk.,9 weeks. 5 batches of cookies. Mixer motor dead.... Repair/replacement from manufacturer requires 2 way shipping equal to half of the item price. I now have a KitchenAid.
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"It's an ok mixer. But doesn't mix as well as a simple hand-held mixer does. Even mixing simple cake dough, the machine sounds like it's strained. Not high-powered. You would be better off passing on this one."
5,mixer,"I love this mixer and it works Great, My kitchen is red and almost all of my appliances. It really blends in and now I need a red microwave thats powerful and electric can opener . I have a red Mr. coffee and toaster oven and pots and mixer and tea pot."
2,I would not recommend this,"Bought this after a small research.Finally chose this because its light and portable.I use it without mounting it on the stand because it doesnt mix the onces below.It gets stuck and I have to use a spoon to mix it again.If u want to use it without the stand then its ok.And the blades are delicate.Mine got bent in couple of uses.I would not recommend this, instead can buy the blender separate."
5,The little mixer that could!,"We had an older top of the line Westinghouse which served us well, but after using the little Euro we were surprised at its versatility and power. Light weight yet powerful. The offset configuration is a little starnge but after using it we found it to be very practical. Love the powered turn table."
2,Powerful but doesn't mix small quantities well.,"I was looking to substitute a heavy stand mixer by something lighter which I can easily remove from the counter after finishing with it.It is sturdily built, insert and removal of beaters, changing from stand to hand mode are all very easy.However, it doesn't mix well in the stand mode. The beaters are small and don't reach the bottom of the bowl.Mixing is not even and batter is separated into the side of the bowl, while the center is left untouched. To achieve a thorough mixing I have to continuously help it a long with a spatula, or change to the hand held mode."
2,Loved it now very disapointed,"Very good looking. LOVED it at first, but am now on my 4th set of beaters. Either they bent or just busted while mixing stiff dough. No its not me, I had a hand mixer for 25 years and NEVER had one problem!!! I hate to get a different one because I LOVE the looks of this one. But it is time to give up, so sad in Oregon."
5,I love this mixer.,Im a baker and my mixer died on chrismas eve. Thank God I was done with my bakeing. Ive always had a hand mixer. My husband Matthew looked around on the internet and found this Euro-Pro. It is excellent I still use the hand mixer but I also love the standup. However im still getting used to it because i never used one before. I am a happy baker now.Geri Kilkenny
4,How is Florida producing such great Rock n Roll???,"This is an incredible album. Florida just keeps bangin out great band after great band...Further Seems Forever, Seville (The Agency), Farewell to Fashion (check em out!!!), and Dashboard Confessional just to name a few... With this album, look for My/Hotel/Year to be in that list in the near future..Great Indie Rock, pick it up if you all ready haven't and go check out MHY w/ Farewell to Fashion..Their live show in incredible. Rock."
4,A Solid Sound: For an Unknown Band,"It's sort of funny that the past 3 reviews have been from people in Florida. I know they're from the Sunshine state, so don't sweat my little remark. There are a lot of bands coming from Florida nowadays: Nonpoint, Keepsake, New Found Glory, Darwin's Waiting Room, etc.... MHY has got that fresh sound that fans of Jawbox, Superchunk, Jawbreaker & even Diffuser (if you've heard of them) may dig. The songs are melodic, yet crunchy and raw. Definitely an indie rock favorite. This band should try to get on some high profile indie rock tours with bands like Jets To Brazil, Jimmy Eat World, Hey Mercedes, Appleseed Cast or maybe even Fugazi. They have a good sound on CD. It's not the most inventive stuff, but it's solid enough for fans of hardcore/punk/emo to really dig it."
5,"A multi-layered dimension of Art, Music, and Rock and Roll..","After seeing My Hotel Year live several times and purchasing this album, MHY has become one of my top 3 favorite bands. This album is absoloutely phenomenal. There is so many different dimensions to it, that not even a thousand listen could encompass all it has to offer. The catchy melodies, textured guitars, and grooving drums combine to create a masterpeice of an album. MHY's greatness does not stop their either. They have the best live show I have ever seen. Give these guys a listen, you will not be sorry."
3,"Helios Creed - 'Dark Matter,Vol. 2' (Dossier)","Maybe not as good as the first Dark Matter release,but still decent.Main thing you need to keep in mind,is that this CD is a bit different than any other Helios Creed disc that I've ever heard.I've heard like maybe at least seven Helios Creed titles.'Dark Matter,Vol.2' is more in the ambient direction.Three tracks here that run over the ten minute mark are the cuts that I essentially enjoyed the most,""Spiral Arms"",""Other Oceans"" and ""Vastness(Flipside)"".Check it out for yourself."
3,Twisted lineage exposes Arthur (!?),"Rather convoluted but *very interesting theory. Not sure how to rate, but 3 stars for interest.Theory here claims ""Arthur"" line through Cunneda, Enniam Girt, through a murky Cuneglass lineage *back to a Owain D... Lineage freaks, good luck with this!"
3,Good buy heavy with battery,"The LED headlamp is bright enough for me to do the night hiking. But one thing I dont' really like is the headlamp has to use at least four AA battery. It will be very heavy if mount it on your head. Fortunately, it has another option that you can use another battery box to mount it on the back pack of waist. I have no idea how come the waist battery box need a bigger battery? For the long distance trail walker, every once is extra burden. If they can modify this option to use the AA battery. I strongly recommend everyone who love hiking should have one."
2,Who recorded this??,"The Gregg Smith Singers and Gregg Smith's writing are both high on my list of creative eye-openers. The ""Magnificat"" was recorded so poorly I was almost happy when it ended. I will not guess what the problems might have been, but fortissimo started breaking up, rumbling, and downright crackling in some instances. This is inexcusable.The ""Prayer"" and the Bach arrangement did not have the audio problems.Admittedly, ""live"" recordings have an unpredictable nature and that environment requires extra attention. Who was monitering this??The Magnificat was just a screw up, plain and simple.Not your fault, Mr. Smith"
5,Mauviel cookware,"Mauviel professional copper/stainless is substantial cookware after proper seasoning these items should give a lifetime of service even for the most active residential kitchen. Have fun but be careful....Large pieces of Mauviel copper cookware are quite heavy, so if you plan to use them(24L and 30L+ stockpots, 28cm+ saucepans, 28cm+ sautepans, 28cm casserole, 16x13 and 18x16 roasting, 16cm+ round pan, 12qt+ jam pan, and others.) remember to ask for help before you move the cookware. Hot stock, sauces, or meat can ruin your day. Mauviel's quality is second to none but if you cant't find it....call Falk in Belgium."
4,A Great Soundtrack - But Buyer Beware!,"The Good News: The soundtrack to House Party will instantly take you back to 1990, when parties were about dancing to good music. The 80's and 90's were about remembering certain periods of our life by the songs that were big at the time, and this soundtrack has jam after jam reminding us of that era. The soundtrack is more than worth the cost just for the ""Surely"" jam by Arts & Crafts (cue Groove ""I'm getting those digits"").The Bad News: One of the hottest tracks from the movie ISN'T on the soundtrack! The most memorable scene of the movie is inarguably the dance battle between Kid 'N Play and the ladies, set to the classic ""Aint My Type of Hype"" by Full Force (who also appear in the movie as Stab, Pee Wee and Zilla). I would suggest this CD to anyone who enjoyed the movie, but just know in advance that ""Aint My Type of Hype"" does not appear on the soundtrack for some strange reason."
4,Terror...this is what you call me,"Terror the first single from My Ruin's debut album Speak and Destroy. Terror is a song with a very deep and hard bass line, and is based on the song ""The Terror"" (the secret track from Tarrie B's last album -Relief Through Release by Tura Satana, Tarrie's last band.) and is a sort of biography for Miss B. Not a particularly up beat track but a must have for anyone who enjoys Heavy Metal. Track 2 of this CD also stands out, June 10th is a very dark ballard, it is strangely melodic compared to the previous track. I'm sure that it has most definatly come straight from the heart of Miss B. If you are unsure about buying the album buy this single and it will change your mind I'm sure."
1,OLYMPUS LETS ITS CLIENTS DOWN,"Olympus has decided to discontinue the manufacture of the ES-10 scanner. So, it did not develop a driver for Windows XP. Thousands of ES-10 owners will have to throw their scanner in the garbage.Without a driver for Windows XP, the scanner is useless. Olympus supports its customers? Yeah, sure."
1,poor service olympus,"I have windows xp on my computer, scanner dont work with system.I would have given it 0 if I could."
1,Terrible!,"I am on my 3rd one now and I am getting very upset! The first one lasted about 6 months to a year, the 2nd one about the same time, and now this 3rd one that I got lasted barely 3 months! What is going on is, the cord gets raveled from time to time, and as it does it creates a short in the product, and it does NOT go on anymore. This is totally unacceptable. You would think the 6 figure rocket scientists would figure out to put an unraveling type phone cord at the edge of the handle or something so this cord doesnt ravel up and have shorts.this product for this reason is a waste to buy. DO NOT BUY IT!I have gone through 3 this time. And this time I am getting a refund or a replacement product. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!"
4,It is nice...,"My husband and I just bought this and we like it just fine. We have not tried the heat yet, but are not looking for a high-heat massage, so it was not a concern for us."
4,Wonderful Aid,"My wife has spinal problems and some nerve & muscle issues. We were on a trip and had walked so much that she was in great pain. I went to the pharmacy and found this wonderful product. I firmly believe that her feet still have feeling due to the daily use of this massager. It has heat, adjustable spacing and several caps. It's heavy and the handle vibrates a bit too much but it serves it's purpose just great."
2,Best for big people who need STRONG massage,"I loved what I read about this massager in the reviews, but now I know everyone must be much bigger and sturdier than me. For one thing, this massager is HUGE. Also this massager can't be set at a lower speed or power, and the default setting is too strong for me. My main problem is my neck, and if I put this thing near or on my neck it vibrates my skull so much it seems dangerous. Literally makes my teeth clatter. It's also disturbing to put it near the spine it's so strong. I regret I tossed the box, because otherwise I would have returned it for refund after 5 seconds of use. This item should have been designed for a broader range of users, not just people with thick tough muscles."
1,"If I wanted a club from the middle ages, I would have bought one!","Beware of this product, it's the size of a club from the middle ages. You can kill someone with this thing! With two hands, it's still hard to maneuver since it's so big and heavy. A horrible, clunky thing that will serve no purpose but knocking someone out."
2,"I want a massage, not strength training!","This thing is waaaay too heavy. Forget trying to massage your back with it. The rotating option doesn't help either. Along with the vibration, weight, and clunkiness, it is impossible to get a relaxing massage out of it. Could be useful when massaging another person, but self-use is not recommended. It's too bad because it is a powerful massager with lots of add-ons and modes."
5,Doesn't get any better,"Brainbug is incredible. Every track is a keeper. Benedictus, Rain, Nightmare = The Best Trance. You won't skip over any. In fact, you'll probably find yourself putting it on a loop. Highly recommended. Hope to see more from Brainbug in the future..."
3,Raven Kaldera Saves this book,"Otherwise I would have given this book a 2.I'm disappointed as I have been waiting a long time for this book to be published. I was hoping to find some stories that speaks to the experiences of transwomen. I only recall one that the main character was a transwoman, the others tend to utilize transwomen more as props and to further other people's stories.There is one exception. William Dean does capture this in his story Tango. The transwoman's sexuality goes unfulfilled while she services the needs of others. I can't think of a better story that captures the experiences of many transwomen."
4,melancholy pop,"Former Dambuilders frontman, Dave Derby, delivers great, sad, slow to mid tempo, pop songs on this album. He really has a nice vocal quality and songs that take you to another place."
2,Slow road to nowhere,"Nothing particularly to recommend here. If you're looking for singer songwriters who not only can sing, but write songs that will remain with you try Freedy Johnston, Todd Thibaud, D. Henry Fenton, Patrick Park, or Bill Fox. This one had me nodding off after song 4. I suppose if you want something non-offensive, this is ok. Personally, I need a little more."
3,My smile looks out of place,"This CD contains two albums by the Miracles. Going To a Go-Go was originally released in 1965. The Tears of a Clown was originally released in 1967 under the title Make It Happen, then it was rereleased under the title The Tears of a Clown in 1970, after ""The Tears of a Clown"" became a hit that year. These are typical Motown albums of the era, in that they contain a few hit songs and a lot of filler. Going to a Go-Go actually features more hits than usual, with four Top 20 hits (""Ooo Baby Baby"", ""The Tracks of My Tears"", ""My Girl Has Gone"" and ""Going to a Go-Go""). The Tears of a Clown has three hit songs (""The Tears of a Clown"", ""The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage"" and ""More Love""). The non-hit songs here are nothing special, for the most part. The best of the rest are probably ""Choosey Beggar"" and ""The Soulful Shack"". Should be of interest to Motown fans."
2,Disappointed,"I've been doing Visual Basic programming for about a year now, and BASIC programming on my old Commodore since I was six years old. I have wanted to expand my skill set with C++ for some time, but some of the concepts--and even the syntax structure--of C++ is a bit frustrating.When I found this book, I definitely identified the fact that this book is indeed geared towards beginning programmers. However, after the first chapter or two, I found myself completely lost. I was unable to follow the author's orginization. Rather than describe in detail how C++ works, he instead jumped around describing what he was doing using C++ terminology. ""Jumped around"" is not an overstatement--I've played a game of Twister that was easier to follow than this.I stopped reading after the second chapter. Overall, I'd say it's *probably* a very good beginner's book, but it really didn't click with me."
1,This is generally a bad book,I had the experience of reviewing this book for use in my High School's Programming II class. We decided to dispose of all 30 copies that were bought before anyone knew any better and go with C - How to Program. This book is bad in the fact that it demostrates concepts well out of the range of a beginners level. Starting on the first few chapters they jump into graphical programming. This gives novices unreal expectations of themself as they are only modifying the author's code. A real no experience programming book should explain the concepts of programming and how everything works from the ground up. Looking at the tiny details of preconstructed code is bad. I suggest you pick up another book.
1,BAD BAD BAD!,"this is the worst computer book I have ever read. They don't teach you anything at all. All they do is tell you to type in code that they created, and don't tell you what to do. Then they say that they have additional code on their website. It's hard to find the code. And once you get the code, it doesn't work. This is the worst book ever. Please do not waste your money on it. Even the ""For Dummies"" books are better. It only has one chapter that teaches you how to program in C++ w/o using their code... and they don't teach you much at all. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Excellent book for people serious about learning to program.,This book was excellent because everything was made so simple. Nothing was made overly complicated like some C++ books often do. This is the book to start out with if you are serious about learning to program in C++ or if you're about to take a C++ course in school. Highly recommended.
1,NG,This item was cancelled and they sent it anyway then when they got it back they never issued me credit had to call credit card company and file a dispute and have still not received credit. I am history from this site.
1,Avoid this horrendous digital transfer! Get the VHS...,"While this is a great VHS- (amazing sound) - the DVD version has increadibly awful audio (tinny, tons of hiss, echo, difficult to hear)! It sounds like someone dubbed it with a cheap portable stereo in front of a TV playing the VHS! Avoid the DVD edition- stick with the video. I do not know WHAT Shanachie was thinking with this one."
2,New Yorkers' changing perspective toward demolition,"Max Page discusses how the notion of demolition has fit into New York public policy over the decades. The topics of the eight chapters are, after an introductory chapter: the work of the Fifth Avenue Association, a critique of Jacob Riis' views on slum clearance, the controversy over saving the old City Hall, the history of the Museum of the City of New York, policy regarding trees in parks and along streets, a critique of Stokes' multi-volume ""Iconography"" treatise, and the symbolism of the children's book, ""The Little House."" The book has over 70 illustrations, mostly period photos of streetscapes and key buildings.Parts of the book are fascinating, especially Page's critique of the writings of Jacob Riis, the 19th century Danish-American writer and reformer. But as the list above demonstrates, many of the topics of this book are simply too esoteric and remote to be of interest, even to a devoted enthusiast of New York history."
2,Wish I didn't.,I originally bought this album for Piano in the Dark & Get Here. But I truely wish that I hadn't. Apparently there is another artist that sings her songs better than she does. I think that woman's name is Oleta Adams... not sure. Either that or they just used all old tracks for this CD-- no upgrades. I have heard awesome versions of those 2 songs but those versions are not featured on this CD. I wish that the music samples were a little longer so that perhaps I would have known this sooner.
2,Buyer beware...,Beware these aren't the original Decca recordings. There are no notes to explain what they actually are--Some are from a live show someplace and all are pretty low-fi. FYI.TAG
5,"Fun, Educational, and Great Competition For the Whole Family",My family and I really enjoy this game. The discussion started is invaluable. The kids have new ideas of where they want to visit on vacation. The strategy is good for even the younger players.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I began taking a spanish class and the instructor recommended we buy a good dictionary by Heritage. I was extremely please with the ease of being able to order and I received my books in less than a week. The price was great too!
2,5:30 Challenge Cook Book,I purchased 2 of these cook books thinking that they would contain the recipes that have been printed in the Atlanta Journal Consitution newspaper which I wanted to try. I was wrong. The recipes in the books were not the same ones as in the newspaper articles. There are some I will try but I was disapointed and feel a little misled by what I expected and what I received.
5,Excellent & interesting cookbook,This is an excellent cookbook. You may not have some of the ingredients on hand so you should review the recipe(s) ahead so you can get the needed items.
1,This book is so not what I expected,"In many of these recipes, one of the five ingredients is bottled sauce. You use hoisin sauce, teriyaki sauce, bbq sauce, pasta sauce, there's even a recipe to make salmon with bottled tartar sauce. One recipe is ziti, ground meat, bottled pasta sauce and two cheeses.In other recipes, instead of bottled sauces she uses large doses of heavy cream, butter or cheese, and while that's not cheating since they are ingredients, they're not at all creative and not the kind of healthy food people today are looking for.You could save yourself the money by buying a variety of bottled sauces, a variety of meats, a variety of cheeses, onions, butter, heavy cream, a frozen vegetable or two, and mix and match as you please. Or to drill it down to one sentence, buy meat and cook it something fattening or processed.Even a college kid who never cooked would probably know they can buy sauces in the grocery store. What is the point of this?Also, the Kindle version has no pictures."
4,Some powerful music,"Alex North was among the most innovative and unique talents that wrote for movies. Although I would not rank this among his best over all, the title music alone is worth the price. It is powerful and moving and conveys the very essence of the tragic arc of the film. Thankfully, the title motif is repeated a number of times throughout the score (except for the cut where he introduces it as a dance tune!) For those who remember and appreciate his scores for Cleopatra or Spartacus, this is not in that league; but it remains vintage North. (Now will someone please tell me why they haven't released Cleopatra on CD?)"
1,Too cacophonous for me!,Music sounded appropriate for a horror film where you're waiting on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. Music had no structure or peaceful quality to it. It sounded like some kids were let loose in a music room to try out different instruments and were having a good time.
1,I didn't find drivers for mac OS's,"The description say ""(PC/Mac)"" but I did'n find anhywhere drivers for MAC OS's!I wrote a e-mail to DR and they said:""I have checked with everyone I can around here, no one has ever heard of a DRUSBmodem, in fact, DRT does not sell any modems.""Bad product for MAC's"
2,just an introduction.,This is a very introductory DVD. It assumes you know nothing about harmonica. I think one would be better off looking at the various lessons on Youtube before purchasing this item.
4,Works as designed,"I use this to move batteries, does its job well. Just make sure that it's centered or the battery can swing and fall on your foot."
3,Great while it lasted,"We bought the Canon ZR25 right before our daughter was born. It took excellent video but was slightly grainy and did have some problems with it trying to focus on other objects. We could live with that because it was so easy to use.However, now I've been working on doing some video capture with my PC and it just ate my daughters 6 month old tape. I figured I'd better not put any of her other tapes in until I tried it out with a new tape. That was a good decision. Now the camera won't play or record and just gives me a ""remove tape"" message.I checked with the store where we purchased the camcorder and they say it starts at $199 to get it repaired.From reading other reviews.... it's probably not worth it!!!!"
1,Defective Product-Avoid,"We bought this camera about 2 years ago. Shortly after buying it, the camera stopped functioning. The only way to fix Canon Camcorders is to send them to one of two Canon repair facilities. We sent it in and it was repaired under warranty. Annoying but fine. Now less than 1 1/2 later, and after light to moderate use, the SAME THING happened. We sent it back to be repaired and were told it would cost $145 to fix! What robbery. I might think of repairing it if I thought it wouldn't break again in a few months/years. Avoid Canon or at the very least buy an extended warranty."
5,Great performer - easy-to-use,"Canon strikes again. This little camcorder picks up where the ZR10 left off. Easiest camcorder to use. High quality of DV - you gotta love those little tapes. Functions that put it above the rest...Analog input, long battery life, media card. Use the still mode instead of a still camera. No more carrying multiple big cameras on my vacation. Just one little versatile ZR25"
2,Very Disappointing,"The only positive thing I can say about this video camera is that it is small and easy to use. The outdoor picture quality is mediocre and the indoor quality is awful. One of the biggest problems is the fact that the auto focus takes far too long to activate and even when activated, the picture is not as sharp and in focus as I would expect from a digital video camera. This problem is even worse indoors. In average to bright indoor light, the picture is grainy and out of focus. My old Sony Hi-8 Handycam took much better videos. Unfortunately, it broke. While I would not recommend the Canon ZR25, I didn't see any other digital video cameras in the stores that looked any better. The Sony pictures looked even worse than the Canon, as the reviews here on ...(the website)support. Perhaps the consumer digital video cameras are not ""ready for prime time."" I would recommend sticking with Hi-8."
2,Misleading title,"This is NOT a rare plant. This is a very common plant. Also,the name is totally made up. It's just purple shamrock or Oxalis regnellii."
4,Nice pan - not sure about the lid yet,This is a great every day pan but I was very surprised that the lid was so light (in weight). I would have thought with a pan this expensive the lid would have been a little more sturdy. There is not problem so far but I am really worried if I drop the lid it may bend?
1,Grammar Shock!,"You'll learn more about the author and her problems, especially with modifiers, than you'll learn about Switzerland. Any Swiss student who completes Gymnasium studies can write better English. The publishers of this series should pulp the book ASAP. They have a good concept, but clearly didn't edit the book."
2,Only for the complete novice,"If you have any experience with Switzerland, or even Europe; you will learn precious little from this book. There are better books to buy on the subject."
3,not for those with any european experience,"If you are hoping for an in depth analysis of customs in Switzerland, this book certainly will not deliver. This book is intended for those with zero experience in european customs, or even those with no experience with western culture at all. If you have been to europe before, this book will probably be of little help to you. The lonely planet guide is probably a better choice. There is an interesting chapter on the history of Switzerland - but you can get that from any encyclopedia. On the other hand, this book was not written from an American standpoint which could be a bonus for people that are not familiar already with Euro-American custom. I give it three stars because the advertising suggests that this book is much more than it is."
2,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this book. Although the book contains some useful information, it doesn't give enough detail to be truly useful most of the time. It's also rather poorly written--the writing style is very strange, almost as if it were a diary. I was hoping for information about the Swiss culture, but instead I got the experiences of one person, which in the end didn't amount to much of use for me. I'd definitely recommend the Hampshire ""Living and Working in Switzerland"" over this any day: although it focuses more on the logistics of moving and settling in, it's much better to read and actually gives you a better view of living here than the Culture Shock book does."
4,culture shocked!,"This book helped me understand a lot about switzerland. From what to expect to eat to what to what to expect at a baptism! it helps you to understand how different parts of switzerland live and helps you for what to expect when you live there for a period of time. if you need all the basics of this buitiful country, this is the book for you! very easy to understand!"
3,Steelers Pencils,"My kids love the pencils. They look great! However, the erasers work terribly. Fortunately you can put an eraser cap on them. I hate when I buy pencils that have bad erasers, but it's better than buying pencils that the lead breaks each time you sharpen them. (The lead breaking is NOT a problem with these pencils.)"
1,Hitler Attacks America!!!,"Norman Goda would have us believe that Hitler was on the verge of launching an attack on the America mainland. Certainly, Hitler had grandiose war aims, and certainly conquering America was one of them. But then again, given the chance, Hitler would have turned all non-German lands into some mixture of an Aryan Disneyland and penal colony.Any decent tactician, which Hitler was, would plan for wartime eventualities, such as a conflict with the US. Goda presents a lot of ""what if's"" for armchair historians to consider, but given that Hitler only ever landed a dozen or so saboteurs on American soil, one cannot say with any precision how workable Hitler's long-range plans were."
1,This album [is bad],"Let me be blunt, this album [is bad]. Is this what passes for metal these days on the west coast? These guys are not hardcore! They sound like a bunch of whinny suburban kids dressed up to look like a hardcore band. Out here on the east coast we would eat them alive, that is if anyone showed up for their weak little show. I don't think it is even fair to compare this band w/ true emocore bands like Tool, Helmet and Deftones. Simon Says sold all of its street credibility. How can they whine when they get paid millions of dollars to put out creatively vapid ""music""."
1,WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?,"If you liked their first album at all, and are thinking about getting this one.....DONT! They are nowhere near good rock anymore, and defineately not close to deftones or tool(as they were compared to). This album is basically a mess of noise and screaming, and their lyrics are terrible to say the least(plenty of unneeded cussing). The first album was, in my oppinion, good....But somewhere between that and now, something went terribly wrong...This is hardly the same band."
2,A dissapointing change for these guys.,"I was extremely impressed with their debut album ""Jump Sart."" So when I heard they had a new album, I had to go get it. I was impressed with the first couple tracks on ""Shut Your Breath"" but it gets the same old sound after every song. The problem with this album is that they are influenced by too many bands out there right now. The album has a lot of Deftones in it. There is also some Papa Roach, Filter, and Stabbing Westward. All those bands are huge, so Simon Says figured they should make an album that would get them more recognition by sounding like everyone else. They actually did a poor job doing it. There are only about 4 or 5 tracks worth listening to. The rest of the album is all filler. They should have just kept their sound of ""Jump Start."""
2,middle ground,"Wow, looking through these reviews it appears people either absolutely hate this album or they seem to love it. I don't see much of a middle ground. I have to say, it sure seems like there are a lot more negative than positive and the total # of stars doesn't seem to reflect that. I do take the middle ground. A lot of what has been said is superfluous, who cares what the band looks like or if they are signed w/ a major label. We should just judge them by their music. That being said, I do see that this band is, while not a straight rip-off of, highly influenced by the Deftones. Unfortunately, it is to their detriment because Simon Says is talented and one can't help but imagine they could bring something more interesting to the party so to speak. Still, for what they do (which is not really earth shaking) they are pretty good. If you like the Deftones and can't wait for their next album, this one ought to hold you over."
1,A little too late.,"This album was great the first time I heard it....when it was put out by the Deftones. It was even ok the second time when it was put out by Papa Roach. In short, this is a band that will probably never amount to much of anything because their sound is completely played out. I can understand Disney's attempt to sign them for big bucks and try and cash in on the rock craze of 2000. But, ultimately Disney's 3 million will be wasted because this band has nothing new, and nothing unique to offer. Don't waste your time."
1,junk,"I bought this album a couple weeks ago, it is horrible. This band is so unoriginal it is almost original if that makes any sense. Every song sounds exactly like a song some other group has put out. I exchanged this one after 2 days. Also, my friend told me that this group got the boot from their label (Hollywood Records which is owned by Disney), because they have no talent. I think Simon Says is the rock world's version of O-Town. Whoever put them together should be embarrassed."
1,Da Haters,"I'm with the guy from Sacramento, a lot of these reviews sound like haters! I'm not going to dis these guys for the way they look or the fact that they are signed by a giant corporate entity that restricts artist's freedom of expression and limits the types of music that are available on the market place. No, I am going to dis these guys for their music. You can definitely hear the Deftones influence in this band. When I say influence, what I really mean is that they ripped off their sound. Sure, both bands are from Sac Town and all, but it would chap my hide if Simon Says blows up on the creative backs of innovative Sac town artists like Deftones or our neighbors from Vacaville, Papa Roach. Those artists came first, they built up the sound. If Simon Says wants respect, they should bring something new to the table. Until then, they get the dis!"
2,unrealized potential,"I have seen Simon Says a couple of times now as they have been the opening act for a couple of shows. Both times I saw them live I thought they were pretty decent and I finally decided to get this, their newest album. I have to say, none of the energy so evident in the shows translated onto this glossy and overproduced album. It really is a shame to see a band with so much potential put out an album that is so mediocre. There are a couple of good songs, but nothing that makes the album worth buying. I'd pass on this one."
3,Dead Weight - the best song ever,Buy this album for the song Dead Weight. It is one of the best songs i ever listened to. check it out!
1,BlahBlahBlah,"I bought this album believing that this band my have something new and interesting to bring to the ever growing stable of rock bands on the popular music market. Unfortunately, what I found was a band that lacks originality and essentially a cookie cutter version of every other rock band out right now. If you are like me and don't like every CD you own to sound like the next one, just buy the Staind album..you don't need this one."
1,please stop.,"I had the misfortune of being forced to listen to this album 3 times through on a recent roadtrip. What is even more unfortunate is the fact that my girlfriend just made me buy it for her. She likes the way these guys look apparently. Don't get me wrong, I am not a hater, and I really like good rock. But, where most killer rock bands like Papa Roach and Staind come off sounding angry and with something to prove to society, these guys come off as whiners. My girlfriend likes their look, that is not enough for me, I like talent. There has to be something better than this out there."
4,Very enjoyable and inspiring !,"I found this book to be very enjoyable. Being a chile fanatic, the red-hot combinations in some of the recipes were exactly to my taste.Being a vegetarian as well also helped! I love Mexican food but can never find that elusive combination of Mexican-Vegetarian; here it is! The Yellow Mole with Vegetables inspired me to invent a similar soup which went down (literally!) like a house on fire. The Banana tree in my garden helped me to enjoy ""Verdura Pibil"". I would recommend this book!"
1,Save your money. This text is uninspiring and uninteresting.,"This is one of the few cookbooks that I have purchased (my collection is in excess of 500 volumes) that I have found to be totally disappointing and uninspiring in its content. There was not a single recipe that I found even remotely tempting. Not one that I was interested in making. Nor was there any useful information imparted vis a vis cooking techniques. Save your money, look for something else."
3,Good grip... unless moist/wet,"At first I thought this was a great ball. Great sticky/tacky grip. A NFL replica, good NFL ball size (NFL balls seem smaller than college balls, which I like since I have smaller hands). However, when this ball gets moist, it becomes extremely slick for some reason. It doesn't even have to be raining.. Some QBs just get sweaty/moist hands, and they will complain about my ball being too slippery.Don't get me wrong, this ball is still nice, much better than your average cheap Walmart football.But I would strongly suggest this one instead: Wilson F1780 GST. The grip on that ball is amazing. It lasts a long time and doesn't get slippery when moist. Yes, it would appear to be more of a NCAA college (big) size, but it's not as big as some other NCAA balls and throws/catches really really well. My new favorite."
1,Not advertised item,I purchased this ball on amazon because i wanted a spare to the one i already own the pictures show the duke football and the gold nfl logo like the one i own. When i received the ball it does not have either logo and is not the same as the pictures show. It is actually the cheaper ball that has a slick rubber surface. Dont purchase from target if you want quality and dont go offf the photos!
1,Wrong item,"The football shown in the photo is not the football you will receive! I had to return this item, due to the fact that they're advertising an NFL gold shield replica game ball and in actuality you will receive an item that is nowhere near the replica. I was satisfied with the fast delivery as I received my package three days befor it was scheduled to arrive, but extremely disappointed in the false advertisement of this item. This picture needs to be changed to the actual item that is being sold!"
4,Good - wish it was on DVD,"I have done some Tai Chi and wanted more, and this tape was perfect. The moves are well demonstrated, explained, and are done very gracefully. I also appreciate how he explains the benefits of Tai Chi. The video I received is not good quality though, and a little hard to view. I did order a used one though."
5,Excellent,The book arrived in a timely manner and was in brand new condition. I am highly satisfied with my purchase.
4,"A Comprehensive, No-Frills Look at NLP","Like most magic tricks, once you learn the secret...it's not as impressive. This book definitely peels back the magic curtain of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in a good way. The book presents a logical progression through the basics of NLP which is great as an introduction or as a comprehensive review for a more experienced practitioner.The Magic of NLP Demystified is filled with content that is well organized. Bandler and Grinder, co-creators of NLP, presented much of their material through books that were transcripts of seminars. These books, includingFrogs Into PrincessandTrance-Formations: Neuro-Linguistic Programming and the Structure of Hypnosis, provide a good context for the use of NLP patterns while The Magic of NLP Demystified provides a clear map of the content of the basic elements of NLP."
4,Bits of PNL in a Handbook,This book is not a theoretical work as you could think reading its title. It's more like a handbook where you find how-to of some tricky techniques ready-to-use.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Something has breached the barrier between the dead and the living, and the dead are coming back to walk the earth, not to mention eat the living.Slowly people begin to realise that is something wrong, but react too slowly, and the dead take over. Some small number of survivors try and hold out."
1,A book as lifeless as a zombie itself,"Yes, George A. Romero is a genius, yes Dawn of the Dead is a career high water mark (to me surpassed by the far darker and mature Day). But this ""novelization"" by Susanna Sparrow is nothing but the script in text format, and with nothing added to give it depth as a novel. Sorry fans but this isn't a classic bit of writing, just some really great marketing."
2,Titulo comercial para un estudio espeidfico,"Mi comentario no pretende ofender, simplemente me parecio una obra con un titulo comercial pero su contenido esta muy dedicado a pocos items, lo que la hace muy especializada y no tan generica como pretende el nombre. En realidad son muy pocas las platas descritas."
1,Quite a shoddy scanner if you ask me,"We bought one of these, and the slidefeeder attachment, to do scans at work. Well, we're on our 3rd scanner right now. That after having to make numerous calls each time to tech support before they decided to replace the scanner each time. The scanner is VERY buggy, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The slidefeeder is poorly designed and poorly manufactured, sometimes it jams, sometimes it tries to feed 2 slides at once. The most common error we get is ""Stage locking screw is still in place"", even though the stage locking screws have been removed. Our first scanner simply died, the 2nd one kept getting the ""stage locking screw"" error, and the 3rd one which we have currently is doing ok, SO FAR, I have no doubt it will fail shortly and we'll be on #4. There are better scanners to be had."
3,Very Poor Tech Support !!,"I have to say that when the scanner works, it works beautiful and when it doesn't it becomes a total mystery. You start to receive funny error messages like ""Cannot focus on slide"" or the screw is still in the unit. Tech support is gravely lacking ! They took away the discussion board which really helped, so now you have to call tech support.I love the unit when it works, I also have the 50 slide feeder which works 97% of the time. The software and tech support need to be upgraded."
4,Best hardware for slide scanning,"I work for a doctor that lectures around the nation. Two years ago, he decided to go digital. That meant scanning all his 35mm slides and preparing them for PowerPoint. I checked out all the flat-bed scanners with the attachments for slide scanning, and finally decided that purchasing two scanners (one flatbed and one for slides) was the best way to go. I never regret that decision. We have scanned over 6,000 slides and still plan to be doing more. Here's a hint for those needing to do a large amount of scanning - buy the automatic slide feeder and then write your own batch commands in PhotoShop to save yourself repetitive work (like rotating the slides 90 degrees, saving them etc). I have also found that the scan quality is better than some of those scanners promoted to be the top of the class."
2,What support?????,"I have had the same problems with my scanner as others have had. Starts off by making wonderful scans. Then after a while scans become a little foggy. Try calling Nikon to have a tech assist me or info to send the scanner to be checked out was drawn out and frustrating. I cant believe that Nikon, a world leader, has such...poor customer service. I bought Nikon becasue of all the wonderful things I had heard about the company, but when it comes to support, forget it. I hate to use such harsh words, but they simply [is bad]. Here I sit with a scanner that makes foggy scans and NO ONE to assist me. $2000 for this? I've been taken, but I only get taken once. I will spread the word and hope others who are in a similar situation will do the same. It's simply not fair."
5,Taras Bulba on CD AT LAST!,I saw this movie in the theatre when I was a kid. I remember I couldn't get the music out of my head. I looked for years trying to find the LP soundtrack. I found a MONO copy just a few years ago. It was not in very good condition. The music also sounded very flat.I was surprised when I saw this title issued on CD. You have got to hear the remastering of this soundtrack to believe the quality and the power of the score. They really did an excellent job on this one. It sounds great.
4,"Great score, cool themes, bit too dated to hold up today","Listening to the Taras Bulba soundtrack it's clear that John Williams was a fan of Franz Waxman. Much of this score seems to be the kind of stuff that inspired him in later years. So much so that much of the feeling and emotion in Taras Bulba is not too far removed from the Harry Potter score.My problem is that the orchestra is rather sparse. I've heard the Taras Bulba score done massively and it's much better than what's on this CD. Yes, the score is great and some of those themes are really cool but they are rather primitive sounding. Even though this release in an 'enhanced' CD (it contains a random clip from the film in pan and scan), try to find the concert CD of the score in the classical sections of your music store. It really is much better."
4,Carle It Rock and Roll!,"This CD is damn catchy! Right out of the box, Ralph E. Carle has turned in 8 fine examples of solid songwriting, with thoughtful lyrics and memorable melodies. While a bit more pensive than its Kiss-themed cover would indicate, the music enclosed herein should more than appeal to their huge fan base. Indeed, Ralph's brand of moody rock & roll is hard to categorize, yet its immediate appeal is undeniable. His rendition of Eric Carr's ""Your Turn to Cry"" is especially enjoyable -- a delicately modernized version of the classic (conveniently, also included on the CD!). Lots of fine acoustic and electric guitar on this album, too. All in all, an impressive debut from a talented young musician."
5,Love it,"I have a 1970 copy of this book, and I love it, absolutely love it. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get lost in a book for hours. You feel like you're walking beside Francie, and Sukie on the streets of Harlem. This book is a thumbs up."
2,Poor product / lousy delivery service,"Was purchased to replace one which blew out the top seal @ 600 miles, note warranty replacement claims may take 4+ weeks, so how can you drive around with only 1 rear shock ? ALSO DELIVERY TOOK ALMOST 2 WEEKS..will order elsewhere next time"
1,Keith Bryan: Twentieth Century Flute CD,"Not impressed with this CD whatsoever. Sound is strained, technique is crappy. I would not release a CD with this quality."
5,"heavy, grooving, slammin death metal","After hearing thier skin the living demo ( which can be purchased on repulse.com) I have been hooked ever sense.The music is heavy and it slams your head in.Murder one has to be oneof my favorites on the disc.I recently caught a show in san antonio and it was intense.If you like chunky riffs and slammin grooves this is a must. I highly anticipate a new disk from dave and the rest of the jugle rot guys.Catch them on tour if you can.They are great live.Remember""change your socks and you wont get jungle rot"""
3,I would have stopped watching.,"If I hadn't needed to watch the documentary for a history project, I would have turned it off. I felt that, in an attempt to make the documentary more interesting, objectified the performers. The scenes from modern carnivals and sideshows, especially, were poorly done, very MTV-esque.On the other hand, the conversations with former sideshow performers are interesting, honest work, as well as valuable historical data."
1,Two and a half stories is what you'll get,"In anticipation of a long boring 8 hour drive ahead of me, I got this CD thinking I'd have at least an hour of Dorothy Parker stories. But in fact, there were only two complete stories and half way through ""Horsie"" the recording company thanked the listener for listening. Now I've read Horsie and they definitely cut out in the middle of the story. Ridiculous! Why??? Don't waste your money."
1,Great for sleeping!,This book is awesome if you want to take a nap in the middle of the day. I read it and felt drowsy after just 5 minutes. This is a must have for the insomniac!
1,Not worth it,"500+ pages for 3 or 4 good ideas just isn't worth it. To all you teachers out there, your time will be better spent reading other professional books/journals rather than this BONE-DRY work. (Makes tax forms look interesting.)Everyone in my district was paid to read this turkey and I still don't think it was worth it. Look elsewhere, friends..."
4,Student Involved Classroom Assessment,I am satisfied with the delivery and quality of the book I received.
5,Will Show You How To Quickly Teach Your Child To Swim,""".....instructional video WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO QUICKLY TEACH YOUR CHILD TO SWIM, not only for fun... but for important, lifesaving water safety.....""[from the back cover of VHS case]"
5,Great cushions!!,Got these cushions in just a few days and they are great looking . Very soft and thick enough to give you a really comfortable feel. You'll love them.
3,decent value for the cost,"I bought this item at a discount and it's fine, but it would not have been worth the full price. The beads are nice (and darker than in the photo, but that's fine with me) but they're strung a little tight so they don't lie flat like in the photo and the chain and clasp are really flimsy."
2,Poor Video Quality in Low Light,"I ended up returning this camera because I was not happy with the quality of video in low light. If you are going to shoot decent looking video indoors you would need to light the setting in some way -- I know because I experimented with a number of light sources including consumer halogen. I had to use at least 20 50W halogen light sources directed at the subject in a room with two windows to get reasonable detail/resolution. Clearly, this is not the indoor environment the average user is going to encounter."

Clearly, this is not the indoor environment the average user is going to encounter."
5,Alice and Another Woman,"These are my favorites Woody Allen 's movies.They are so human... with a touch of humor, I just love themWoody knows women as no other movie director does.¬°¬°¬°Bravo!!!"
1,Alice,This product was defective. The sound was very poor quality....sometimes undeciphable. I was very disappointed.
1,I hated it,"It's simple, I hated it. All the jokes were stupid and the plot made no sense. Don't buy this movie, burn it in your fireplace."
2,Lethal Review,"I reviewed the CD, it was not bad. I was disappointed that the original artists and original score is no longer available. The CD is a mild attempt to compensate, but lacks the authenticity of what has promised to become a millineium classic film series."
1,Come on,This CD was very deceiving. I really thought the songs that were performed on the CD came from the original artist.
2,Not bad for the money,"The songs on this cd aren't the original artists, but for the money, it's not bad."
2,Film Focus,"I must have misread the synopsis of this cd. I didn't realize that it was unknown musicians performing the songs from Lethal Weapon 4. The one vocalist sounds very similar to Eric clapton but it's not quite the same. It's as if a bunch of studio musicians were putting on a recital and trying to impersonate the original performances. Sorry, but it just didn't do it for me."
5,Excelent!,"Even though the songs are new versions of the old, they are very well done. This CD is NOT EXPENSIVE either. Given that there are only 6 songs. I highly recomend the movie too. BUY THIS CD NOW! It's VERY worth it."
2,Stopped working after 9 months,"The fan stopped working after 9 months of occasional use. In fact for the first 3 months I had this, I didn't use it at all. It got so hot, it lit up in my hand. Very scary, It's a nice item, but the warranty is over at 6 months and now I need a replacement. My old craft heat gun is still going after 7 years. Definitely disappointed in the quality, but while it worked, I liked it."
3,Didn't even last 30 days!,I have to buy another... let me start with that. It was working GREAT it is exacly what I need. Only one problem - it fried out set itself a blaze and now will not work.Hopefully it is just a one time thing.Trying another because I have never had a heat gun work so well.Would give it five stars if it lasted more then 30 days.
5,I can emboss after 10 pm.!,"LOVE this Heat It Craft Tool! My previous heat gun was LOUD and blew air with such force it removed some of the embossing powder while heating it. This Ranger tool is quiet, hot, and blows the air gently. Now I can emboss and dry ink projects after the children are in bed~"
3,Not a lot of heat,"I was excited about this product because I heard it was very quiet as opposed to other heating tools that are incredibly loud. Well, with that it doesn't seem to get very hot. I have to hold the tool very close to the paper in order for it to emboss and that sort of wrinkles and warps the paper. I guess I'll be going back to my loud but quick and effective Stampin' Up heat gun."
5,Nice tool,This is an awesome dryer. Keeps you from having a long wait when wanting paint or ink to dry fast. This is definately a must when you are embossing and crafting. Great product.
2,Not enough heat,"I watched videos, read some reviews and didn't think it would be bad.My backup gun burned out (it's used to many things besides papercrafts) and I wanted to make sure I had a backup. Quiet is good right? Well, quiet is but I have yet to get the gun to melt embossing powder! I pull out my Milwaukee (SU) to get the job done. I'm not kidding when I say I sat there for 2 minutes and it didn't melt any powder! I timed it. My other gun did it in seconds. It works great if you just want to dry your paper but to use to emboss I haven't been able to get it to work. A waste of money in my mind. Did I get a bad one? Are they supposed to be painfully slow? I will be contacting the company about it. My recommendation, don't buy this one. Heck my cheap $15 backup lasted 13 years, at times running for hours to thaw out pipe! This one, wouldn't thaw out a Margarita in Mexico."
4,More than just yoga for surfers,"In this video, Peggy definitely steps it up compared to the two previous videos. The video extends beyond the yoga realm into pilates and beyond. I found this more challenging and enjoyable than YFS2. My only complaint is the use of Brian Conley and Garrett McNamara. They are both just tokenly going through the easy motions. Tom Carroll is the real star of this video, and his flexibility and strength is definetely impressive. All in all I would recommend this video."
4,Great DVD for those who are dedicated,"I have been doing this program for a little over a week and can already see results in control, focus, and confidence. Work as hard as you like and see positive results in the water. ---Jamaican Rob HB,Ca."
3,Good but specific,"This DVD is tough and definitely advanced, and long, it is definitely worth the money. it is less of a power-fluid flow movement and more focusing on poses that are very advanced. i was expecting some flow for warm-up and then a transition into the poses but it isn't organized like that so its not a dvd i'll use a lot, but i'm sure if I ever get bored with my power yoga for surfers II dvd i'll advance to this one"
2,"Comfortable and durable frame, but flawed electrical","I've owned the above bike for about a year now, and it has just gone out on me. I've used it sparingly during that time, and have had nothing but problems with it. As another reviewer has noted, my bike has also developed a loud thumping noise in one of the pedals within days of having purchased it. I should have returned it, but I thought I could live with it. Now, the tension control on the wheel has broken, making it impossible to increase the pedal tension above the first level.It's unfortunate, because overall, it's a nice bike. It has a sturdy, durable frame that was rather easy to assemble, and looks nice. I found the seat to be comfortable and easy to adjust. It's just the electrical or mechanical controls that I had a problem with. For the money, I would have expected a more reliable product. I'm rather surprised at how quickly it broke, and would give the bike more stars if it were not for that."
1,Waste of Money,"Delivered in a broken box. Computer went on the blink 4 weeks into using it. Fly wheel broke and could get no resistance after 6 months. Overall, disappointing."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"The bike goes together easy enough, but the 1st one I took delivery of had an electrical problem and made a loud clunking noise which transfered a bump to the left pedal. I returned that one and the 2nd one also developed the loud clunking sound after only two days, but this time it transfered the bump to the right pedal.Also, you have to plug this bike into an AC, which many other brands do not. Finally, the jumps in resistance from level to level are too great.It's too bad because the price, size, and comfort of the exercise bike is excellent, but the problems with this model would make me think twice about buying another Schwinn exercise product."
3,"great bike quite, fast shipping horrid comfort","The bike is great use it 5 hours a week, but the seat is so uncomfy, I have found myself going to my condos workout room more often now because of the better comfort while doing my cardio. If you are going to use it allot dont save like I did get the 213 or better model."
2,Full of typos,"This is a revised edition of Reuben Fine's 1952 classic. However, this edition has an average of two or three typos per page! It is disgusting what they have done to an otherwise interesting book."
3,A ruined classic,"... Reuben Fine's ""The Middlegame in Chess"" is one of the greatest technical manuals ever written. The revisor (Mr. Hochberg) states in his revisor's note that ""the book was, and is, a unique volume of chess wisdom from one of the greatest players of the twentieth century."" Mr. Hochberg then proceeds to ruin the book with typos and mistaken diagrams. A reader will have to spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out what the moves in the original play lists were or where the pieces in the diagrams are actually supposed to be. I still give the book three stars because it really is outstanding information. But I don't recommend it to anyone who can't figure out what the errors in the text and diagrams are."
3,"Great Material, Horrible revision & editing","Reuben Fine had a unique, clear style in explaining the game of chess, and it shows in this work. His assessment of positions is great for a patzer like me. However, Burt Hochberg & McKay / Random House have managed to revise this on the order of John Nunn doing Bobby Fischer's 60 Memorable Games. Huge numbers of typos and errors in diagrams make for difficult reading.Fine produced a classic work. the reviser and publisher forgot a couple of things -- proofreading and accuracy."
2,Lots of mistakes,"Some of the diagrams and a lot of the text items have typos and mistakes as the other reviewers have pointed out. This guy who did the update to this book did a horrible job.If you want to learn a lot about the middle game get Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors along with Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors. These books will also help make your game stronger in the Opening and Endgame too. Also, The Middlegame by Euwe is also good."
1,Do not buy this of #$#@#!,This is worst product I've ever purchased. First they claim they will send you a rebate which I've never got and it's been more than 2 months already. The speed is not even close to what they claim. Take my comments to heart and don't make the mistakes that I've made. Amazon should ban this product from their site as it looks really bad to carry a non reputable vendor that doesn't live up their claims.
4,It's a $ drive ( assuming rebate comes back:-),"Drive arrived after being shipped to WA, very quick though as I was living in GA not so useful :-) 2nd attempt drive arrived installed 1st time, and so far I have had no problems. It reads CD-RW / CD-R with less errors than the drive that's burning the disks. Noise on full spin is intrusive but music cd's play with no more noise than my other drives. ( If you need hi-fi a cd-rom and speakers aren't the way to go anyway :-) Only complaint is the frail tray mechanism. 4 stars with a rebate, 3 without."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRIVE!,"I am a computer engineer, but even I couldn't get the piece of horsesh!t to work. I went through 3 drives and countless hours of tech support, but it was totally hopeless. At least i get to keep the rebate."
1,Digital Research rebate never arrives,"I purchased a Digital Research CDROM drive in March of this year. I mailed the rebate coupon, my receipt and the UPC code from the box and I never received the rebate.Don't count on receiving rebates from Digital Research."
2,"Poor customer service, but drive operates OK","The drive installed and perfomed OK for me. I was also one of the ""lucky"" ones who received a faster drive than what I ordered (supposedly, 1 in every 5 or so was randomly chosen to receive a faster drive). Take that for what it is worth. BUT, as for their rebate program, IT SUCKED! After about 2-3 months, I emailed Digital Research 4 times, and called twice, before FINALLY receiving a phone call from their customer service department. I then received the rebate after a total of about 4 months. Overall, I would neither buy nor recommend buying from Digital Research."
3,Not perfect,While they look just like the photo they don't operate quite so smoothly. They are made of wire can be slightly bent out of shape causing the cans not to roll. They do not work well on uneven surface so if your fridge is not perfectly level do not expect the cans to roll. They're OK but not perfect - might try the hard plastic once next time as comparison.
1,did not like this product,"does not hold 12 cans very well, the shape is awkward inside our fridge and the cans drop at an angle causing them to get stuck in the back"
3,Would be Five If not Bent...,"I ordered two of these items. I took them out of the box, removed the packaging and put them in my fridge. The first one loaded up perfectly with cans. The second not so much. The second one is bent and ends up catching cans and does not roll as freely as the first rack. I thought of returning it but by the time I factored in time to the post office and other time I'd have to spend, I opted to just pitch it. I have not decided to take a chance and order a third.So if its not bend, the item would be great."
3,Now that I've had it a while...,"It's getting annoying.Aside from it being difficult to load because the cans go all sideways and crazy, it only holds about half a pack. When loading, unless it's about 3/4 of the way full the cans will fall sideways and get stuck.If my fridge had a lip it'd be easier, but when pulling a soda out or loading, you have to hold the dispenser down so it won't slide out and fall out of the fridge. If this had suction cup bottoms it'd be better.I'll use it a while longer, but it's becoming more of a pain than it's worth."
2,Cans don't fit,I keep having to flex these open to accommodate 12 ounce cans. My husband will not even use it so they just get set on the counter and sit. A little pricey to have to constantly adjust to use.
2,Disappointed.,"From the photo I assumed that I could put two rows with one row of brand of soda, one row with another brand. This isn't what it does. The top row rolls back and down to the bottom row."
3,Flimsy,It was a little bent when I got it so I bent it to where it would hold the cans. A little flimsy but doing the job for now.
3,Good price but not stackable,I assumed these would be able to 'stack' one on top of another and was disappointed to find they do not. Good price for this item though especially if you are not looking for an option to stack them.
2,It looked good but....,"Yes, it looked good but after using it for several months, I hate it. The design allows the cans to either fall out the back or become dislodged at the back which stops the thing from working.I have bought a new plastic model which I got today and hope will do the job. It sure won't let the cans fall out!."
1,poor design,"The cans do not slide smoothly, get stuck sideways, and the top cans fall off the back as often as they drop into the bottom slot. The angles of the top and bottom are not enough for the cans to rotate down."
2,"made in china, way way over priced","when arrived says made in china on front of package, extremely light, also, much smaller to me than the pic looked, looks and feels like cost $5.00 to make, in china probably ten cents. these should cost no more than $10.00"
3,"Loved it, but...","We loved this toy, but within a year of purchase the spinning sand/water funnels and wheels have all broken. I contacted iplay to find out about a replacement and apparently they are not available. You can't just connect another toy to the table because the toys connect with holes. So now we have a sand and water table with no toys attached, which is a bummer in only a little over a year!"
5,beautiful,My fiance got me this ring almost 2 years ago and I have yet to take it off. It is absolutely beautiful and I get so many complements on it!
4,This is great,"This is a great cd... Different from your average pop punk... but still great.. and not so annoyingly catchy and stick in your head brain rotting... Its brilliant, and you should buy it now!!"
4,Pretty catchy CD these boys have.,This cd is pretty darn good. I got the oz factor cd and I liked their sound but they were missing that catchy happy pop sound that gets the song stuck in your head and makes you sing along. well on this cd thats all taken care of. This cd is where it's at if you like a little softer punk kinda like surf music. Some songs are kinda lame. I don't know whats up with the end part but It's cool. If you like the band or this kind of music buy it.
5,Better than Blink,"Wow. Amazing. This CD blew me away. The first time I heard it, at 2 in the morning, I knew it was good stuff. They've got their harder songs like Teenage Suicide, Sorry, and Holiday, which carry on the Unwritten Law name. But two songs in peticular, Cailin and Before I Go, made me re-think what Unwritten Law is all about. Buy this CD, regardless of what music you like."
5,This is one of the best!!!!,"I love this CD!! I recomend it to all my friends and have gotten so of them hooked too cuz we dont get to hear the on the radio. The mysticism of california sky and the sadness of before i go to the hilarity of sorry, makes it a well rounded album. I say this is for those who want something not beat to death on the radio."
5,Really good So-Cal punk,"This CD is incredible. Unwritten Law takes every espect of So-Cal rock and blends it into one excellent cd. This is probably the best punk rock cd I have heard since NOFX's Decline. Don't compare this with NOFX though, Unwritten Law has their very own unique sound. Every song explodes with an energy and raw uncut sound that no one can compare to. These guys are very talented musicians too. This isn't you usual underground bar chord punk, this music has serious depth. Harmonic, Teenage Suicide, and Before I Go really shows the talent that the band has. Genocide/418 is a great 2 song set featuring Brandon Boyd and Mike Einziger (2 of the best musicians of rock) of Incubus. Of course, there are some really hardcore punk songs on this CD too, I haven't mentioned most of my favorite songs. Anyone that likes punk rock and music that has depth and meaning will love this CD. This one will be played over and over in my CD player until the new Tool cd is released. Enjoy!"
5,"One of my Top Four Fave Bands, and my FAVE CD","My four favorite bands are Weezer, Beatles, A New Found Glory, and Unwritten Law. I have several CDs by these artists, but I have to say that Unwritten Law's self titled CD blows them away (well except maybe the Beatles, but, c'mon, Its THE BEATLES) I would recommend this CD to people who are into punk, softer stuff, emo, indie, almost anyone can relate to it. It has funny tracks like ""Sorry"" and then sweet stuff like ""Cailin"" BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,Soulful and touching. Great album.,"This is a painfully depressing album to listen to. In all my sessions of listening to it I have never once felt that bad because of an album. It's such a powerful collection of songs. I sincerely doubt a punk band can become and more emotional. It's a great achievement to the genre. The lyrics are powerful and hit deep within. Musically it has an epic feel to it(check out ""California Sky"" for example) and than comes down to an almost bluesy and melancholy level(Check ""Before I Go"" for another example). ""Teenage Suicide"" is a fast and hard-hitting track and has a powerful message in it. All around a great showing from the band. I eagerly anticipate other releases."
3,Hard to read hands,Beautiful to look at. Get compliments from friends however the true functionality is to tell time. I find it hard to read the hands unless I tilt to catch the right glare of light off the glass cover. Always have to double check what I thought I read.
4,Fun Memory collections,"If you are a ""scapbooker,"" don't get this scrap book, it isn't what you are looking for. It is a cute little book to store unconventional little mementos like parking tickets, fortunes from fortune cookies etc. Some of the pages might be a little too racy or grown-up for little girls, so save this for someone who is a teenager and can take it to college with her.This is a nice way to hold onto all the random things you've saved from dinners and dances and group dates, and not have agonize for hours over the perfect page arrangements and decorations. Who wants to spend their life perfectly arranging the ""ideal"" scrapbook? Try living a life instead."
3,"A good book, but too bad for a good girl...","This book is like a page by page scrapbooking template printed on pink patterned paper. The illustrations and designs are scrawly and gorgeous and the book is what it says it is: a perfect book for those who have lived a... full life. In some ways that's one of the drawbacks... to fill in every page of this book it seems you need to have a lot of bitchiness and hatred in you. One thing that might be useful for customers to know which isn't clear from the Amazon pic is that the scrapbook's cover is transparent matte plastic, which kind of cheapifies the book - but the book is spiral bound so the addition of stubs, papers and the link won't warp the spine of the book."
4,Too soon to die.,"A potential heir to the Sinatra throne, Bobby Darin passed away at the height of his considerable powers as a crooner. His evolution from his ""Splish Splash"" rock and roll hit to a master of the American Song Book is evident in this album. A treat for all who saw the almost realized greatness in him."
5,Great as always,For me Bobby darin has never performed badly. Never be another like him.As always this is a great CD.
3,A little bit of a let down.,I know Kaffe Fassett reuses his photographs and designs. I don't blame him. But I prefer not to pay for repetition.
2,Just OK,"I am enthralled by all things Kaffe and always have to have his latest book. Somewhere along the line I missed this one. When I saw it, I ordered it without looking closely at the reviews. It is not the usual. I will probably put it in the least accessible part of my Kaffe shelf. It had nice photos but very little for the quilter part of my soul."
5,They just keep on going,"I've been a Pivit fan ever since they were on the surfing movie ""Loose Change"" by Poor Specimen. They are a great band that never lets down (sort of like a beer). I recommnend this to anyonme who likes the sound of a real rock band. By the way, i'm not really 12, i'm 16. And as a guitar player, Pivit is fun to listen to and fun to play as well."
5,Pivit rawks,I love this group. Who cares about the drummer. Just don't change vocalists. Buy this CD if you want to hear something good.Big up to ULBig up to Blink 182Big up to Agent 51
3,good basic book,"This is a good book particularly for first time buyers. About half the information is devoted to general real estate matters, and half specifically to second homes in particular. More specific information about specific problems and advantages in certain areas would help (what to look for in beachfront property, mountain property, etc.). Competent but not the only resource you'll want to read."
2,"A ""Boomer"" in Pa.","There was more basic information about real estate in general, than in second homes in particular. As most people considering a second home have already been through the buying,selling, or building a few times they know most of this stuff through experience. But I understand Tiger Woods works on the fundamentals routinely, so an evening going over the basics didn't hurt."
5,Overlooked in the field of storage. Great buy.,"Works great. Fast and effective, snap to install. unless your a monkey :) no problems at all with any of its functions. One happy customer."
5,The Genius Emerges,"We have two masterpieces here. The first is ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."" The second is ""Alice."" The others are vintage Allen and deserve to be seen, for the first or tenth time. ""Crimes"" is a brilliant piece, gorgeously well-acted and directed. The cast is superb, probably the best ensemble performance since Cassavetes' films with Gena Rowlands and co. Martin Landau gives one of the most startling performances of the decade, a performance which must have helped give this remarkable talent a second life. But in the end, it is the writing and direction that make this such a deep, moving film. ""Alice"" has, of course, the incomparable Mia Farrow, who emerges here and in other Allen films as one of the most exciting actresses of our time. They made a great couple. She introduced him to the Upper-East side, grand WASP lifestyle that became his subject matter for the next twenty years. She was his muse. He has never really recovered as a film director from her loss."
2,A trap when ordering DVDs from the USA?,"Upon arrival I could not view the DVDs due to a problem with a ""regional Code"" Must be with the DVD player (LG) and because I am not in the USA ( south Africa)Hope I can solve the problem otherwise I have wasted my money."
1,PRODUCT DETAILS: WHAT PRODUCT DETAILS?,"How about including the names of the movies contained in this boxed set in your so-called ""product details"" ?We all know that Woody Allan is virtually always ""vaux le voyage"", but the merest hint of the actual content would be useful here.Bless you and may you have many children."
2,Not as good as 3,"Ultra Chilled series got weaker here (though this is a stronger effort than 5). The standouts on the CD are Erlend Oye's, ""Prego Amore"" and Kelli Ali's beautifully haunting track, ""Sunlight in the Rain,"" both of which you can play over and over again without getting tired. Other than that there is a mix of mediocre songs."
2,Weakest chilled CD,"I am a chilled CD fan, but I found this to be the weakest CD in the series. Most of the tracks are slow and uninteresting. I had a hard time finding a single track that I liked. I am surprised that other reviewers rated it so highly; so I had to give my opinion, since I bought it on their recommendations. The only track I liked was the one with Nora Jones doing background, but it alone is not worth the price of the CD. For a much better compilation, check out Ultra Chilled 3, which has many great songs."
1,This Item Arrives As a Big Crate Full Of Parts,"I debated on purchasing this splitter or the 27 ton Troy-bilt also offered on Amazon and I went with the larger size because I often split large heavy wood. The 27 ton states specificly that only minor assembly is needed, this one did not but I didn't notice it. When this model arrives it is completely disassembled! UPDATE! Now that I have used it I love I love it, very heavy duty, easy start and cuts through logs like butter. I would like to change my rating to four stars but I dont seem to be able to do it. Would give it five except for the assembly issue."
4,Vocabulary to Conquer the Divorce Process,"Divorce Empowerment provided me with the vocabulary of the technical aspects of divorce which I knew nothing about. After reading, I felt particularly well equipped in areas that had intimated me previously, particularly the legal and financial concerns.I would recommend Divorce Empowerment to anyone who is in a position where they need answers to their questions as well as to know what other questions and issues need to be addressed before it is to late."
4,Not just for exercise,"I bought this just because I can't find any of Traci's movies anywhere. She looks terrific in her yellow bathing suit and the camera loves her too. Lots of good angle and closeup shots. There is another girl and a guy on the tape too but not much of them. It's 90% Traci bouncing and flailing around looking hot and I don't mean sweaty hot, I mean soft porn hot. I am not induced to jump up and jazzercise along with her, I just watch. It does become somewhat boring after a while, watching her exercise and having to listen to the pumped up music. You can always turn down the sound and put on your own music, as I do. I might have put it on 6 or 7 times in the years I've had it. If it came up missing from my library I probably wouldn't miss it too much. Even so, if you are looking for Traci you won't be dissapointed with this. She is here and looking real good. Heck, maybe you could even exercise along with it..."
1,For those who need to know how porn stars keep in shape,"Yes it's Traci. The same Traci who was an underaged porn queen and switched careers to disco diva, actress, porn star again, and now exercise enthusiast. Who produces this no talent bimbo? She's like the Jill of all trades, but does nothing well. What's next? Broadway theater?If you're a Traci fan, I guess this is a must for you too. Someone went through the trouble of filming her bouncing around in a bathing suit, so I guess you need to see it. Personally I'd rather give my money to the poor and hear Traci just once ask ""Would you like me to Supersize that?"""
5,skill builder,"using this toy in a skill center for adults with intellectual disabilities, nice patterns that are not too juvenile, big shapes eases use for all skill levels and hand sizes and shapes, excellent tool for individuals that need ""busy hands"" as well"
5,Everyone wants a pet like this one.,I loved Star Dog when I read it as a child and I reccommend it to my children now I'm a parent. A great adventure story with all the emotions of E.T. you will want a pet like the Star Dog.
5,Celebrating Success,"WOW! As a native Richmonder I was completely awed by this book. It captures the lives and events of Black Richmonder's with vivid pictures and thorough captions. This book is more than just a picture book because the writer took the time to research and write detailed captions about EACH and every picture. The book was a joy and the pictures were fantastic. The book is divided into easy to follow sections and includes sections on Landmarks, Churches, Politicians and Education. (There is even a section devoted to Virginia Union University) Now all can see the Richmond I have always known a place where Blacks have fought and thrived for many years. Kudus to the author!"
1,look great but poor quality,"I was excited to find these at such a great price on amazon and was happy with the product when I received it in May of 2010. I also ordered along with the front mats, the 2nd and 3rd row for my 2007 ford explorer. The fit is great, the color matches perfectly and they look great...however, it's now 7 months since I put them in my car and the drivers side mat has worn a hole completly through where my heel hits the carpet. I expect wear, but not a hole just after 7 months. I thought the Amazon price was great compared to everywhere else I found them, but not worth the money for the quality."
3,Mejor una versi√≥n m√°s moderna,"Esta es una versi√≥n cl√°sica, pero me gustar√≠a o√≠r una versi√≥n m√°s moderna como la Versi√≥n Popular o La Palabra de Dios para todos."
4,Good Travel Companion for parks around Lake Superior,"A good camper and RV traveler handbook. The book begins with Minnesota's North Shore Parks and Campgrounds and continues north and east into Ontario featuring Provincial Parks along the circle tour route. After crossing at the Soo, Upper Peninsula State Parks along or near Lake Superior are featured. The guide book ends with the Bayfield Peninsula, Apostle Islands, and Amnicon Falls."
1,This is freestyle?,"I don't know what Thump was thinking....but nothing could be further from a FREESTYLE compilation than this. ""In De Ghetto""?...Great track....but NOT freestyle. If anyone is looking for a non-stop continuously mixed freestyle c.d....check out Bad Boy Joe's Best of Freestyle Megamix...'cause he truly mixes with passion! Thump should consider Bad Boy Joe for their mixes in the future."
5,"This worked so well for me, I still remember it years later","This book had a huge impact on how I wrote my college essays, and it was a good read, too. It _has_ been a few years since my college days, but I found this book so helpful that I looked it up immediately when my niece reached the college-planning age."
5,What every DBA should know...,"Frank McBath has successfully filled a gap in the reference book section with this complete guide to SQL Server 2000 Backup and Recovery. With its in-depth content and real world examples, McBath's book provides a comprehensive look at everything you will need to know about SQL Server backup and recovery. He highlights common problems and provides practical workarounds. One of the great things about this book is that it is not so general that you would be hard-pressed to find useful examples. McBath gives you the commentary, the code and the specific content that you can use at work. This is definitely the kind of book that every SQL Server DBA should have!"
5,momofjst,"This is by far our family's favorite musician! His songs are fun, humorous, and even have a lesson to learn. We came across Zak by accident as he was playing at our local library last year and we now have both of his CD's. He is playing at my son's school this spring and I can't wait to see him again. Our newspaper recently had an article about him (he grew up in Cincinnati) and had rave reviews also."
1,one of the worst sci fi books I've ever read,"This book uses trite, convoluted language to tell a story that's frankly just not all that compelling. Yes-the concept of implanting computer chips in human brains may have been revolutionary at the time, but now it's passe and I think there's got to be a GOOD writer out there who can make that theme a LOT more interesting.You will yawn all the way through this book. Only read it if you're having trouble sleeping!"
4,Superb Collection For Beginners,"This is the collection to get if you are only a casual fan of PF as it resurrects an old Herd song 'From the Underworld' and continues with tracks from his time with Humble Pie including 'I don't need no Doctor' from Rocking the Filmore. The remainder of the album concentrates on his seventies output with the obvious 'Show me the Way' from Frampton Comes Alive. That is probably the only gripe as it would be refreshing to hear the studio version of this song as FM rock stations seem to overlook it.A terrific overview of Frampton's career from 1967-1979 and not overly long winded, it would have been tempting to issue a 2 CD set covering his entire career but enough is enough and this does the job of introducing PF to the uninitiated handsomely."
3,Bloch not quite at his best,"Like Psycho, Bloch based this novel (however loosely) on real-life events. American Gothic focuses on the career of H.H. Holmes, a serial killer who lured victims to his ""castle."" Bloch's version is appropriately chilling, and carries his typical stamp of suspense.However, Bloch is best known as a short story writer, and for good reason. His stories shine, while his novels tend to drag. This book is no exception. His writing style is much better suited to shorter fiction, and the plot and atmosphere of American Gothic are not well sustained throughout the length of the novel. If you are a Bloch fan, then by all means read it. If, however, you are a horror lover, something faster-paced may be more to your liking."
2,Bland,"The main downfall of the story is not that it's not readable - it certainly is - but that the pacing is snail slow and seems to drag on and on. It would have been much better suited as a shorter story, or else where more action (even if invented) took place. His writing style is as enjoyable as ever, and Bloch fans should still read this one if they run into it. Suspense is there in moderate doses, but not with enough frequency to save this book from the to-be-traded pile."
5,I really liked this story,"Despite the other reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed this story and have re-read it on several occasions. I do not think that the story line dragged and the characters were well-developed, I thought. I would like to see the book available on Kindle."
3,Good-if you like Aerosmith,"This album is really good; if you like Aerosmith, that is (since many of the songs recorded on this CD are Aerosmith songs). Oh, yes, the Aerosmith songs are the ones that make buying the Armaggedon soundtrack worth it because of the fact that the only truly good songs that are not Aerosmith are ""Starseed"" by Our Lady Peace, and ""Leaving on a jet plane"" by Chantel Kreviazek. In short, if you have Aerosmith's greatest hits, save your money and don't buy the Armaggedon CD. It's not worth it."
1,Hit Songs From The Film Armageddon,"Cheapo Lollipop Music Spanish pressing of the Armageddon hit song album with all the familiar tunes . Has a small piece of the Armageddon theme by composer Trevor Rabin at the end , but the sound lacks dynamics . Poor artwork , no photos and no liner notes . OK if you just want the songs . There is a better quality release of the hit song soundtrack available from Sony Music . For more thematic material check out the better quality pressing of the ""Original Motion Picture Score"". It has no songs , but plenty of ballsy , macho sounds from Trevor Rabin plus liner notes and photos . Best of all is the 2 CD bootleg which has all the music recorded for the film by Trevor Rabin and co-composer Harry Gregson Williams ."
4,A real interesting music in relevent to the movie,"Even this piece of music is abit wierd to me, in terms of techno and rock and pop...it sure makes me wake up."
4,Thousand Peaks is a small treasure.,"This is a picture book with a small collection of poems from throughout Chinese history.A poem appears 3 times: in chinese script, aa a literal translation into english, and as a poetic translation into english. There is also some background information for each poem. The only thing I could wish for, are more poems.I found this book extremely satisfying to add to my lesson block on China. I paired it easily with two other books, so my students and could try our hand at Chinese calligraphy: #1 The British Museum; Chinese Caligraphy; Standard Script for Beginniners, to learn the strokes. #2 What's in a Chinese Character, to confirm and translate a chosen character from the poem.I also, of course, invested in a few chinese calligraphy sets. The small ones are fine. You just need an ink stone, a well, a brush, and some rice paper."
4,Not as good as her previous ones,"I really do like the Eclaire mystery series. And I'm looking forward to delving into the last, Shiveree and hoping it grabs me like the first two books.Bad Hair Day...was just too much. Too long, too much going on, too many characters to keep track of, much more 'dark' than previously. Ms. Dunbar's writing is still superb. I just wish Bad Hair Day had been a touch more on the light side.Despite the overabundance of action and characters, the book is still good, and I'm very glad I read it."
5,?????One or the other?????,Good comparisin between the two and goes from hand to hand. Shows each side of the story and goes in to great detail. Great one to get for an imformational video.
2,"Creation or Evolution, not really.","My wife purchased this video recently to use in a college course she was teaching on Evolution. She was looking for a video that would present an unbiased view on the ""Question of Origins"". Unfortunately what she got was a video that is most definitely skewed toward a Creationist point of view. Totally useless to her. I have given the video a 2 star review since if you are a Creationist you would probably enjoy this video, while if you are an evolutionist you should look somewhere else for a more compelling video."
