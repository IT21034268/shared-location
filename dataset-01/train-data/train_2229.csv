1,new formula is poor quality,"The original pears soap was hypoallergenic and did not clog pores, it also smelled wonderful and had less ingredients. The New formula dropped the the two beneficial claims and added chemicals. It now smells of frankincense and a touch of tar. Otherwise it's not the worst soap in the world but it speaks't deserve to be called Pears."
1,Product Limitations not posted on outside of box!,"The product installed per instructions. However, when I attempted to transfer files, the product I purchased did not allow selection of specific files to relocate. ALL files had to be relocated! However, if you wanted to be able to select specific files, then you have to buy the ULTRA version (costs twice as much). I feel this limitation of the product should have been clearly stated on the box. I am sending the product back to Eisenworld for a refund."
2,Stopped working after an year,"Bought this from amazon. Worked well for compact flash cards. Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera). so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera. And all of a sudden, it died on me. Had to throw it out."
4,Smart and To the Point,"I selected this item because of the rebate offer that was associated with buying the product. I believe that Dazzle will honour all 3rd party rebates on their site. The product is compact and sleek, and fits nicely on virtually any desktop. I've already tested my SD and CF media and it works great. I'm not such a connaisseur of data transfer speed that I could ascertain Reader --> PC Speed, but I really don't think you could warrant spending more money for only marginal performance increase. I'm very pleased with my purchase and know now that I can accommodate all my digital media (until they come out with something new of course). One note of interest: The little contraption that the reader sits on to give that 'elevated' feel/look is actually not attached to the reader. It's a little add-on piece you use optionally. From all the pictures I'd seen, I'd always assumed it was attached. Just FYI."
4,problem with memory stick,"The reader does not read Lexar memory stick. You have to go to the dazzle online to down load the firmware to solve this problem. I only used it to read memory stick. Don't know if it works well with other medias. However, the price is low if the mailing rebate works."
4,High quality television that will endure,"I have owned a 13-inch Sony Trintron for more than five years and have been very pleased with its performance. My television has never had any maintenance or performance problems and it works as well as a new one. I noticed that this 13-inch TV is significantly more expensive than several other 13-inch brands featured, but I'd say it is worth it since it will last for years."
2,Dull write up of grand adventure,"I have by now read many sailing adventures, circumnavigations, etc. While I'm sure this was a grand adventure, somehow it just comes across as flat and ho-hum. Very little interaction with local peoples along the way, mostly just hung with the other cruising sailors, especially if they were also from the midwest. If you plan to cruise there is information here(albeit a bit out of date now), that would probably come in helpful."
4,"Not a parrot light, but good light","This is not a parrot light. I had earlier reviewed this light as a full-spectrum light for parrots. You need the ""True Color"" lamps, which Amazon does not carry, for the proper spectrum for parrots, and the ""Vision Saver"" is a different spectrum. It is a very nice light, so in that respect it warrants a good rating."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH OTT LIGHT,"Bought an OTT lite and it worked, but, when the bulb burned out, no replacement bulb worked. Exchanged the lite for a second unit and the same problem occured. Coincidence? I think not. Buy any other kind of light-not this one."
5,A Wonderful Book on What Real Yoga is All About,"Sri Chinmoy is a realised spiritual master (he conducts peace meditations for the United Nations staff). He explains what Yoga is (real yoga is spiritual union with God, not the exercise postures that most westerners perform). After reading this book you will want to read his book ""Meditation"" (to learn in depth meditation yoga)and then all of his books, which contain not only invaluable information, but will spiritually uplift and transform you as well."
5,Excellent Steamer for the Price,I highly recommend this steamer - it matches perfectly with any of the Cuisineart Chef's Classic pots and works flawlessly for all vegetables. A steal.
2,cuisinart steamer not universal,Unfortunately I had to return the steamer as it did not fit my triclad cuisinart 4qt pan. I should not have listened to another reviewer who said it did and actually measured if my pot was 20 cm in diameter. It is off by a cm. The triclad steamer insert was actually cheaper but did not have as good reviews. It does not list the diameter so I am nervous about ordering it. (Cuisinart website doesn't list the triclad steamer diameter either).
5,Steaming right along....,"A must have, if you own the Cuisinart Chefs Classic set of pans. Steaming is the most healthiest method of cooking, locking in the good things that are washed out with boiling. This steamer also makes a great colander! Very useful kitchen tool."
5,love this,I always wanted one for steam veggie now that I own one will use it.and we'll tell my family to purchase this item.
3,why so cheap,"was made of such cheap flimsy plastic. i guess everything is these days, i just hoped this would be better quality."
3,Sandisk Sansa Silicone Case for e250,The silicon skin is fine. We had to wait an extra week for the armband.
4,Very nice!,"I really like this case. It fits the player like a glove. The armbad is comfortable and easy to use.The only thing I didn't like about it was the belt clip. I tried to put it on the case and snapped. No big deal for me, because I didn't buy it for the belt clip.So, if you just want a case and arm band...this will do very nicely."
4,Sansa Silicone Case,Nice product for my Sansa player. Slips right over and protects it well. The armband is a nice touch and a good value. Got a pink one for my wife.
3,Unbeatable price,I purchased the item on the 19th and it came on the 22nd so I was able to wrap it and put it under the tree in time for christmas. The case seemed real good but I was confused on how to attach the belt clip to the Mp3 player itself and the armband. Also I'm wondering on how to attach tthe protective screen. It came with no instructions so I guess I'm gonna have to figure it out.
4,Good Buy,"After looking in various stores for these items, I found exactlywhat I wanted for a good price and realy good quality."
3,"Case ok, but no screen protection","We bought and like this because it changes the colour of the unit. However, fitting it means the screen is no longer protected when not in use because is now too big to fit into the velvet cover.An improvement would be to replace the arm-band (which we have yet to use) with some screen protectors."
3,e280 Silicone Case & Accessories,"I purchased this combo package for the silicone case/skin tha was offered in the package. - Skin, screen protector film, armband, belt clip assembly. The silicone skin is actually very good and the screen protecting film is excellent (watch out for air bubble when applying). The armband is okay and the belt clip assembly is not very good."
3,jazzersharon,The silicone case is fine. The belt clip will probably never be used. The armband is much too long to fit around my (or my daughter's) arm.
3,Save your money,"The silicone case was nice, no complaints. However, if you want a functional belt clip and arm band you could do a whole lot better. No instructions for the belt clip, and it feels like it will break the first time its used. The arm band was just one velcrow strip that can be brought just about anywhere.My recommendations, just get the silicone case. The rest is trash."
3,good cover bad clip,"First I ordered the blue and got the pink but i like the texture and it fits well. no instructions TIP: the round part of the clip unscrews to attach. but it didn't work well anyway so i just removed it, and after i spent all that time figuring it out."
4,Silicon Skin Good; Armbelt & Belt Cliip Cheesey,"The silicon skin was good as was the screen protector. The belt clip was confusing to put on--no written directions. The armband is one velcro strip. Overall, enough value for your money."
3,Get what you pay for,"It's does the job great. My biggest concern was getting a screen protector for my mp3 player. The clear protector that came with the package had a sticker on it, and when I removed it, there was a bunch of residue that wouldn't come off. I ended up throwing it away. The armband works good though."
2,Sandisk Sansa Silicone Case,"Not the quality I expected and the screen cover was a piece of thin plastic like material that looked like it could cause more damage than help protect the screen.I have tried to return the product because the add says thirty day return policy but the seller has not responded to any of my emails. He is not interested in customer satisfaction, only the dollar.My biggest mistake was not paying through pay Pal so I would have some sort of mediation.I would not even entertain this purchase or seller."
4,Great Case,"I actually bought a couple different cases for my Sansa before I got this one, they were a waste. This case is awesome, keeps the player protected & doesn't take away from it's look at all. It fits great & since it's rubber it's a little easier to carry & doesn't really slide around if you lay down, say in the car. The only thing I don't like about it is the clip that comes with it. You're getting a sweet, rubberized case with a huge clear belt clip that totally takes away from the case! If you're like me & don't plan on using the belt clip, get this case, if you plan on using it with the clip, look around & try something else."
4,Just what you need,Everything you need to protect your player in one package. The screen protector is tough to apply and not get any bubbles - but once the screen is illuminated you can't see the bubbles anyway. The belt clip is kinda useless - but I really only wanted the case and screen protector anyway.
4,Good product,"I have been running on the treadmill with the arm band and it works great. Also, the screen protector is nice because the screen seems to pick up some scratches. Would be perfect, but the belt clip is white while everything else is black. This is exactly what I needed for a very inexpensive price."
4,Sandisk Sansa accessories,"Delivered within good time, no probs, pink cover is a good fit. Armband could have more thought put into it."
1,Never Agian....,This vendor has the slowest responce time ever. I had to e-mail him to ask him where my order was a week and a half after I ordered it. I have e-mailed him recently to ask him about the missing belt clip and I have yet got a responce from him. P.S-I e-mailed him last Friday 1/5/06Still no responce..1/11/06
4,Intricate design!! Not a bad buy for your buck,"Very impressed with the intricate cuts this cover had for the hold button, SD slots, power button. I had bought another cover prior to this one and it did not have slot openings to access the hold button, which I tend to use a lot. It also comes with a semi-durable plastic belt clip, which i probably won't use regularly as it looks like it can snap after a few uses. this item came with an armband and protective screen also. The screen was easy to apply but make sure you are not around too much lint or dust to maintain a smooth application surface. Overall, a good buy. I would order from them again in the future if needed."
4,Good but.....,It's a pretty good case. I love the feel of it. No hassels to put on. Keeps my Sansa clean and looking like new. I gave it 4 stars because everytime you turn the volume up or down you hit the the pause button which is a nuisance. PERFECT that and it would be 5 stars.
5,1:24 1978 pontiac firebird,"I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase, and will definately use it again!"
1,The Biggest Piece of Unmitigated Garbage I Ever Bought on Amazon,"STOP! Do not buy this set of unmitigated garbage. I have been buying products on Amazon since 1998 and without doubt this set of ""pots and pans"" is the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought. Within two weeks all of the ""pots and pans"" in this set were either scuffed, stained or chipped. SAME ON YOU AMAZON for making such a piece of crap available on your website. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"
2,very difficult to clean and easy to get dirty,even i just boil the water...it is easy to get water mark and very difficult to clean
2,Pot lids do NOT 'stay cool',"So I feel I got suckered by these reviews claiming 'stay cool' handles. The long pan handles do stay cool. But the pot lids most do not. Try boiling a pot of water with the lid on -- yeah, very basic thing to do, with pot lids too hot to handle. It would have cost them so little to add some protective material to these lids, very cheap of them not to."
4,Nearly Perfect.,"This nearly perfect cookware set is worth the investment. I use them nearly dail for cooking most any meal! A few spots have black specs as I noticed mentioned in other reviews, but it hasn't impeded the performance of these pots one bit! The construction is solid! I prefer plastic-free and non-stick coating free cookware. These will be in my kitchen for a long time coming!"
4,great pots and pans,"These stainless steel pots and pans are great! It is good value for the money. I bought these for my college going son. I did not want to spend as much as Alclad, but still wanted something that would last a while. He loves them. One thing he did mention is that the pot he uses for pasta got rainbow colored spots. I think that perhaps he used very high heat setting. I think that medium heat is all you need to use with this set. Overall, for look, price and performance, I would highly recommend this set."
4,Very pleased,Arrived as described in protective yet minimal packaging. The pieces work well - providing even heating across the bottom and all the benefits of the material. I couldn't be happier with the value for the price.
4,Be careful: follow instructions,Good product. Haven't had a problem for the past 1 month. For an all metal product the handles do not heat up even after a long time on the stove. Please do read the product instructions to understand conditions under which these work well. Your stove could be too hot for the cookware to handle.
5,Best set of pots I've ever had,"I love my Cuisineart set it is wonderful. First it saves on electricity because everything must be cooked at a lower setting on the stove, but the pots still get very hot and the food gets cooked really well, I am very pleased with this purchase and hope to buy more Cuisineart products."
5,So happy,"I recently purchased this set for my daughter. I have used a Faberware stainless set for the last two years and THOUGHT I was happy with it. After seeing the Cuisinart set I decided to pass my Faberware on to her. So glad I did. First, besides the nice appearance, I love the fact that the handle really doesn't get hot, unlike the other stainless I had. Also, I noticed that my water boils much quicker, too. I'm going to add to my pieces because I can see using this for a long time."
5,It's a pleasure to cook with these!,"I am extremely pleased with all the pans in this set. What a great value for the money! The heavy bottoms are wonderful for everything from melting chocolate to making something like lemon curd, which requires a lot of watching and whisking--even rice doesn't stick and is easy to clean. As the directions say, soaking the pans while they are still hot makes for easy clean-up. I occasionally use Barkeeper's Friend cleanser on the insides and bottom (not the exterior sides) to restore the shine. I also love that the lid for the larger sauce pan fits on the omelet pan--didn't realize that when I was purchasing it.My only caution would be that for heating something over a long period of time, such as soup or stew, the handles to the lids can get pretty warm. On the other hand, the pan handles are constructed and attached so that they do NOT get uncomfortably warm, which is fantastic.These pans are not only functional, but beautiful. I am very pleased."
4,Excellent quality for the price,"This 7 pc Cuisinart cookware is a perfect addition to my othercollection of pots and pans. The quality is excellent, thesizes perfect, and use, clean up are easy. The heating isalso an improvement to what I was using before this purchase."
4,Looks and Cooks Great!,"The cookware set cooks evenly. The set conducts heat well enough that your stove can be used on much lower heat settings than cheaper sets. The pots and pans are beautiful and can be hung beautifully. Make sure to follow the directions on how to clean the cookware and it will look good for years to come.BTW... the handles stay cool when cooking. However, I would still suggest that you use oven mits with them."
5,excellent,"it's shiny, strong, and even not heavy. I use them everyday.we are 2 people to use it, the size of each pot and pan is really proper for us.I strongly recommend it."
1,Very Disappointed,"Just very disappointed of the quality. I've already replace the whole set once, because the pan had some coating went off in less a week.This time, the pot in the set split down the side when cooling down after cooking some soup. Unbelievable, I've never seen this happened from any pot, any brand, any price. Don't buy it even they have Buy One Get One Free. I wish I could load the picture for you to see it.This is not a bad reflection on Amazon, but very disappointed in Cuisinart."
5,Thank You Amazon & Cuisinart *Mint*,"I brought (2) sets of this beautiful Cuisinart Cookware, it is fantastic!! Free Shipping!! Great Price!!! Plus a $25.00 Discounted Deduction!! & Free Rebate OffersThis was all too good to be true, but indeed it is a awsome reality, my items arrived well packed & the products in mint condition...I am so pleased that my food will be graced with the usage of Cuisinart at the complimentary offerings of Amazon, you both have made my upcoming holidays beautiful, again thanks to Amazon & Cuisinart, god bless everyone & all the best to everyone!"
5,Always excellent quality,This set was a gift to my son and the reason I chose Cuisinart is whatever they make I can count on excellent quality. My son loves them and has only good to say about them. No negative report.
4,Inexpensive but invaluable in the kitchen,"It's wonderful to find a reliable, well made set of pots and pans at such a great price point. The pans are easy to clean and cook evenly. Running them through the dishwasher does cause them to change color a bit, but I've used them long enough to know they'll hold up well and stay lovely."
4,Great Bachelor Set,"This set was great. I wanted stainless steel but didnt want to piece together a set or buy a huge 14-piece set. I was cautious to buy online because I was afraid of getting this bottom cookware that didn't cook evenly. This aluminum core set heats very well even on my gas stove.A bit tougher to cook eggs, and cleaning just requires a little soak and it cleans up easy. If the pots ever lose their original luster just hit them with a bit of Barkeepers friend."
1,Falsely advertized,"When I received this Cuisinart 77-7 cookware I notice that the term 18/10 stainless was not imprinted any where on either the product or the accompanying enclosures. I called Cuisinart twice and talked to Richard and Tiaira and both of them said if the pot or pan is not stamped 18/10 stainless it is not made of 18/10 stainless. An Amazon customer service agent referred me to Susanne the Amazon customer service Supervisor; she said that since I ordered the pans from a third party, I would have to go through the third party to get my money back. I explained to her that I have been an Amazon customer for years and all I was trying to do today is let Amazon know that they are falsely advertising this product. She was no help at all and told me to contact Cuisinart again."
1,Worst cookware ever!,"Be aware. After first use, the pot showed some dark spots that couldn't be removed. Called the customer support and was told to send the pot back for inspection at my own cost and included a $7 check for handling fee. Why do I need to pay extra money for a defected item? Will never buy cuisnart again."
3,Good value for the price,"I ordered this as a lightning deal for $74.99.Pros:looks really nice - very shiny and professional looking. Would look nice on a rack.convenient sizes - good starter set to do the basicsIt really is stainless - my husband burned the bottom of the pan cooking bacon and it all came off with a brillo padCons:I have a gas stove top, and the handles get really hot on these pots - you definitely need to use a pot holder with these"
4,Very good and affordable,I have had mine for awhile and it is nice. It does not heat exactly evenly but give the price it was worth the money. I use them very often but my only issue with it is that I wish the skillet to be a little deeper. Other than that it works very good. I would say it at least deserves 4.25 stars
5,Excellent Cookware,I am very satisfied with the stainless steel cookware. Just what I wanted. I would recommend it to anyone who is contemplating getting a new set of cookware.
4,Good stuff,"Everything is sturdy and well made. I've used the pots several timesand made a stew with the big pot that turned out well.The frying pan, however, is a disaster. Even with lots of oil, everything sticks and scorches and falls apart. Definitely not good for eggs - use your non stick pans."
1,Pitting / holes developed immediately,"Cannot recommend this set. Just received it today and used the large crock pot, which immediately developed two pitted holes in the bottom after first use. I followed all directions and recommendations, and never even turned the heat above Medium-Low. Stay away!"
5,A absolute must have,"I bought this along with ""Wildlife Art: 60 Contemporary Masters & Their Work"". Both books are great, but""Best of Wildlife Art 2"" is a must have. The captions under the art tells you what the medium the artist is using. ""Wildlife Art: 60 Contemporary Masters & Their Work"" doesn't alway tell you and you have to guess at it. I also like the art in ""Best of Wildlife Art 2"" better."
2,Not much artwork on big game,"Not sure I was pleased with the contents of this art book. The cover features a big leopard, so I assumed the book covered big game and large cats and other mammals. The book was 80% paintings of birds. Many of the featured artists were ""no-names"" so don't let the cover fool you into thinking this is another wildlife art book with the likes of Bateman and Seery Lester."
4,The title is apt! A fantastic chronicle of Marilyn's more unusual photos,"Defintely worth buying! And yes, there are many photos in this book that have not previously been published; although all of them are in black and white, this does nothing to diminish the radiance and loveliness of Marilyn. This is a great book for Marilyn fans, with many photos you will recognise as previously unseen from many of her appearances. With sympathetic and expanatory text by Clayton, who appears to have done her research, this book is definitely worth keeping."
4,So nice to have these on DVD.,"I always liked ""Night Court"", it was one of those few off-beat comedies like ""Green Acres"", ""Barney Miller"" & ""Taxi"" which introduced really quirky characters which are missing from today's banal offerings. It's really good to have these first 2 series on DVD."
1,Talk About Being Over Charged,"Lets read the choices on this page:Night Court Season 1 $16.49Night Court Season 2 $19.99But, buy both together and pay $42.99, or only $6.51 MORE than what one would pay by buying the two sets separately.$19.99 + $16.49 = $36.48. $42.99 - $36.48 = $6.51.So, I have to ask, are the 34% who supposedly buy this overpriced two pack just bad at basic arithmetic, or what ?"
4,great sitcom,Night court is a really funny sitcom and I am glad I found seasons one and two at such a great price.
4,Night Court: Seasons 1 & 2,I like movies and old television shows and this is a good T.V. show and it is a classic that had to have.
1,2nd Edition?,"2nd Edition is not currently used in the college course that is being taught. Unfortunately, I needed the 3rd edition"
4,"Real People, Realpolitik","Legacy and Destiny is a fine book, especially for a first book. Though it's billed as a political thriller, I found it dealt more with ""realpolitik""--the down and dirty about the horse trading that can make or break candidates for political office in America. More than anything, though, I appreciated the care the authors gave to developing their main protagonists. Though some characters were somewhat two-dimensional, ""Jack"" and ""Elizabeth,"" the book's heroes, were lovingly crafted and well developed."
1,Simplistic dreck,"I found this book to be highly disappointing. It is shoddily writen, and despite the potential of its subject matter, is ultimately just 250 pages of simplistic dreck, with vapid characterizations and really bad dialogue."
5,"Outstanding, riveting - I could not put this book down","I picked this book to read instead of two new books by best-selling authors, and I was very glad that I did. After the first five pages, I could not put the book down. This political thriller is packed with action and drama, and it makes you wish we had more politicians and presidential candidates like Elizabeth. Voting would be more fun if we did. I loved this book, and I'm sorry that it's finished, but I look forward to more by the same authors. The book would also make a great movie.This book also meets my requirement for teaching me new information at the same time that I enjoy a good story. It is obvious from the description of the authors, and the information in the book, that they know what they are talking about. I'm a book collector and an avid reader, reading about a book a day, and this book ranks among the best I have read. These authors tell a great story and I hope they write more soon. (Robin in San Diego)"
3,not a good fit,not very happy with this product. Wasn't what I expected in terms of the fit. I wouldn't buy this item again.
5,Wlangler rugged wear pants,"Very pleasant to wear, great material, perfect fit, feels like it willlast for years. I ordered the second one, different color, samefeatures. Currently I am retired in a tropical country, these are just the pentsthe doctor ordered."
4,Educational and fun!,"I bought this for my 5 year old son. He is engaged by it and has fun figuring out where the pieces go. The cards go from very basic to difficult, which is nice for kids of all ages. I love definitely recommend this to parents, teachers, day care providers, etc."
2,Mixed bag,"Though I like the idea of the toy, there are couple of reasons I didn't like this as much as I though I would:1. From the photos it appears that the figures are like kid's jigsaw puzzles where the border is raised so that kids can easily fit the pieces without the pieces moving. But only two figures are like that. The rest are just pieces of thick paper with figures printed. So no real value for money and makes me think that the packaging is a marketing poly that makes customers think all puzzles are of the same type.2. The puzzles range from just joining two half circles to form a circle (which I think a 2 or 2.5 yr old could do) to fairly complex ones probably more appropriate for a 5-6 year olds. Unless you are buying it for a 2-3 year old and plan to use it for 3 years or so you will 'waste' part of it."
2,"Good, however flawed","The concept for the toy is god however, the reality is quite different.....the main flaw is that the small plastic shapes are hard to keep still when placed on the small card. When my child plays with card, it tends to slide around and the small plastic shapes have little weight and are hard to place. She will put in the shape outline and as soon as she takes her fingers off it moves out of the outline. It moves even more when placing the next peice as well.Buy Block Buddies by MIndWare....I purchased both at the same time. Block buddies was a few dollars cheaper and much better. The shapes are made from wood and overall learning method is similar. The shapes are easier to manipulate and stay in place."
5,Exceptional Toy,"My son received this for his third birthday from his aunt who is a professional buyer in the toy industry (so she has a lot of time to review products). The toy is extremely educational. It teaches kids how they can create a whole picture (like houses, cars, trains, etc.) from shapes. It also shows them things like how 2 squares can make a rectangle or how 2 half circles make a whole circle. The shapes are extremely durable (they are made of a heavy duty plastic, and are not painted, so they don't loose paint. It comes with about 30 different tile mats. My son is now 4.5 year's old, and he still loves it. We are going to be buying the SuperMinds 5+ version in the future. We have hundreds of toys for our son, and this one is in the top five. Exceptional toy! Also, I think it is made in the USA, which is a nice perk."
4,Mighty Mind - builds confidence,"My daughter just got this for Christmas. She is 4 1/2 and loves it. It gives instant confidence and is good for an active child who doesn't like to wait a long time. She got oodles of toys for Christmas and she keeps coming back to this one, so I ordered the Supermind upgrade. For those of you who are missing pieces, maybe you can order them from the manufacturer. They were very courteous and helpful AND they answered the phone immediately! I'm going to buy more to give as gifts too."
4,Awesome Toy,"I bought this for my five year old's birthday this year. The first time he played with it, he played for an hour and a half. He really likes it. But he's the kind of kid that loves puzzles and building things--I can see how other kids might not like it as much."
5,Awesome service,Product came in the fast manor that was indicated by seller. Book was in excellent condition -- almost like brand new! Thanks for the help and I look forward to buying from you in the future :)
3,"An ""ok"" book, not the best","I only needed this book for my pre-req statistics course, Some of the easier examples were easy to understand, but there are times when certain concepts were not depicted with examples which made it easier to grasp concepts. wish i had a better book for course, maybe my grade wouldve been better. oh well!"
3,"It's dry, but it's statistics, so what can you expect...","The content is dry! If you work through the problems at the end of the chapters, it helps in understanding the concepts and to determine when and where to use the concepts."
2,Textbook,The textbook was in great condition but the cd that accompanied it does not work. After I installed it the application did not run right and the excel workbooks for the homework did not exist.
3,ZenMed serum,"Although this product alleviated some of the flakiness on my face, it did not help much with the redness. That being said, I have not found any other product that helped as much with flakiness. I do plan to at least try some of the other ZenMed products."
2,disappointment,I used this product for 3 weeks at which time I developed a rash on my cheek. Also there was no evidence of lessening of the redness. In fact it was even more red on the one cheek. I was very discouraged. I had high hopes for this product.
1,didn't work for me,Used this product faithfully for months to reduce the redness on my nose.Didn't do anything. Very disappointing. Money wasted.
4,I'm not sure what the other reviewer is getting at...,"Although I prefer The Crook of My Arm, I don't view this record as a disappointment. My only complaint with this record, if any, would lie in the fact that, to me, it sounds too much like his first solo album. On these records, Ali Roberts applies the idiosyncratic style that he used in interpreting traditional folk compositions on The Crook of My Arm to his own compositions, which sometimes borrow from traditional material. Nothing about his record is far removed from any of his earlier work. If you like Appendix Out and like The Crook of My Arm, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't appreciate this fine, consistent effort."
2,Bison Designs Rasta Nylon Dog Leash,"I bought this leash to go with the accompanying dog collar (size S)[see my review]. The leash, which comes in only one size, is too large for a small dog. The colors are not a vibrant as in the picture. This leash should only be for medium and large dogs."
3,I would pass on this,"This item is great if you are trying to get your last minute email at the airport or something along those lines. You have to be careful when the card is sticking out of your palm though. It's very thin and although I never broke mine, it always seemed to lead me to believe that it was going to happen soon. The speed is really slow with this card. Don't get this card and expect to be surfing the net on broadband speeds! Also the battery drain with the wifi on is super fast! I would recommend that if you are looking for a handheld to surf the internet on, don't choose one that needs this card."
4,Palm Wi-Fi Card,"Transfers are slow, especially if pictures are included. It really sucks the battery down quick. But overall it is what I expected and connects my PDA to the Internet."
2,Have to say...not loving it the way I had hoped...,"I get a lot of fatal errors on my Zire 72 and it freezes often, requiring me to perform a ""soft reset"" when trying to browse the web. It works OK from home with my wirelesss connection there, but my whole reason for purchasing it was to use at work, but that's where all my problems exist. Others I know have had MUCH higher levels of success with the Sandisk card. Wish I had gone that route!!!"
2,Wi-Fi Card Review,"I do not recomend this card. I bought one and it is very flaky. Works one time and next time does not. Keep getting error that it is not compatible with my E2. Looks up my palm and I have to soft boot to get back working. When it is woring the range is horrible. I would say there must be a better solution in the near future.Gary ChamberlainFennimore, WI"
1,Unsupported and buggy,"When it works, the wi-fi connection is good and fast. However, the software is buggy and causes my Tungsten E2 to crash a lot. If you try to get support, they repeatedly tell you to hard reset the Palm and install the Wi-Fi card before anything else. I did so 3 times, trying also to identify which other software was responsible for the crashes. It was still the Wi-Fi driver. And the support refuses to hear about that and repeat their useless advice. By now, PalmOne could issue a new version of the software since many users do complain.My suggestion: keep away."
2,"Product works, but energy consumption makes it impractical","This add-on WI-FI card adds this wireless functionality to those Palm devices that have none. In my case, I paired it with a Tungsten T3. Although I was able to connect to the web easily, the power consumption was so great that I had to turn off my Palm device within 10 minutes. If you want to use your palm as a notebook replacement, wireless internet is not an option. If you use it while charging, it might work. This will, of course, reduce its portability. If you want Wi-Fi on a Palm, my advice would be to get a Palm with WiFi already integrated; e.g., Palm TX. There is a separate power source for WiFi which allows wireless web access without the power consumption problems plagued by this add-on card."
2,Bad Signal,I am dissapointed with this product. It loss very easy the signal and I could't get the wep authentication with my Linksys router.
1,Bad Deal,The WiFi card was advertised as being easy to install with a companion CD. It was actually delivered without instruction or the CD. I had to search the net for the correct drivers and it functions intermittently with my wireless hub. I no longer use it with my PDA so this was a waste of money.
2,the wi-fi card,"Allthough it was described to work with my specific PALM device, I just wasn't able to connect. Maybe it is the right device and I am just stupid, maybe it would help if there would be more instructions of how to configure it...so far it is useless. Sorry."
4,PalmOne P10952U works very well,"I found the installation to be easy and I was able to connect to my home network within minutes. I am also able to locate other open networks while on the road and in professional office buildings and I am able to check my e-mail, etc. However, I recommend that the user implement WEP encryption to protect from malicious sites."
4,WiFi Card for Tungsten T2 Palm Pilot,This works fairly well. Doesn't always allow me to get my e-mail but usually picks up a local wi-fi signal at the airport or wi-fi hot spot. It's fine for me as I just use it to surf the net and check the stock market when I am traveling. It beats carrying the heavy laptop.
2,palm wifi,"Disappointed with this product. The first thing is its excessive need for power, battery life used up in less than 15 minutes!!. Secondly, is the screen resolution with the webpro browser that comes with the palm tungsten T3 is very deficient. A lot of things with graphics will not come up, and the screen even with its unique option to expand the screen, still is very inadequate. Unfortunately I have alredy bought 2, one for myself and my wife's T3. Looking to see if it can be sold back somehow."
2,Disappointing,"The range is limited, it drains the battery within twenty minutes and the settings are challenging. Transport is irritating, as there is no case. Leaving it in the device means risking snapping it in two because it sticks out half and inch from the sd slot. Save yourslef money and frustration and don't buy it. It does, however, function, for the most part, as advertised."
3,Send me a teckie please,"I have no doubts about the WiFi card purchased through Amazon for my Palm Zire 72, but I am continuing to have difficulty configuring the device so that it will work.For those of us who use computers, why is a degree necessary to decipher instructions which could so easily be written for a consumer with no technical savvy.The reason I purchased this item was that I had been told that it ""installed in a breeze.""Some aroma. Some breeze."
2,not what i thought,"This card works, I guess but you can not browse the internet with your palm through it. Still have not figured out what use it is, I thought I would be able to check my email and such if I had this card, not so. A bit frustrating to get into a room that has wireless access and not be able to browse the internet."
2,Too complicated,"I never use it. If you want to have wifi in your palm, you-d better buy one with this feature incorporated. This card is too complicated."
1,Works well when it works,"Under normal operating conditions, I have no issues regarding this WiFi card, which I use in a Tungsten T3. While the battery drain is a bit high, it still performed very well... Until... The big problem I got from using this device was a ""Fatal Exception Error"" that seemed to rise out of nowhere, requiring a hard reset. This is an exceptionally big problem if you have any sensitive information on your device - I used mine for storing some encrypted data. It's amazing how little PalmOne has done to help. Their website offers little information (they say to do a hard reset - thanks for the great tip!), and their support line is no better. My advice is to not bother with any PalmOne products if you are looking for a WiFi device - get something more reliable. I hate to say this, but I feel like PalmOne is headed downhill FAST, thanks to their poor customer responsiveness."
1,compatibility,"I bought the wifi card that said ""it now is the only card for the TungstenE2"". I get it and it comes up not compatible, now what do I do.Frustrated customer!!! jankramm!"
3,Good...but i lost my money!!,I really like Amazon.com and everything but I did lose a lot of money! I returned the item (Palm Wi-Fi Card (P10952U)) back to address stating that I purchased the wrong one. It turned out to be incompatible with the PDA that I use. I returned the item and did not receive any sort of refund! I would appreciate it if someone could contact me about this! My email is Ywjpheej@myldsmail.net. Thank you very much!
2,"As Jim Cramer would say, DONT BUY","I have the Treo700w and get this card for Skype VoIP. The sound quality did not come through at all. slow speed with sound distortion. If you are getting it for same scenario, dont waste your money. This thing is going back to Amazon."
4,The zodiac and WIFI,"This product was bought to be used on my Tapwave Zodiac2. I had already downloaded the drivers, so the installation was a breeze. It works like a charm except for the fact it gives an error message that it can't find DCHP servers on the secure WIFI network. Remove the authentication and you have no more issues....wish I can get rid of that bug though. All in all in I rate this card a 4 for the issue described above and the battery drain... which is conciderable.....The service from Amazon was exemplary.Amid"
5,Good product,"I like the card, it is really convenient and easy to use, once you setup for the first time.I ran into what looks like a rare problem, when I first installed it I will constantly get DNS timeout errors every time I wanted to connect to the Internet, the solution? I had to hard reset and re-install all my programs. After that it worked like a charm and I haven't had any other problem, I love it and now I barely use my Sprint Sony-Ericsson T608 to connect to the Internet since almost anywhere I can find a hotspot either free or very cheap.Word of advice if you have a T3, buy a Power To Go battery, the T3's battery life is not great and with WiFi is even worse, having the extra juice will allow you a full day of all day connectivity."
3,A good product,"If you have a Palm and want to surf the web you'll need itPalm presented the T5 without Wi-Fi, why? bussines !!!!The problem: you have to put in and put it out every time you need it and it uses the SD slot, this represent a problem when you have some info in you SD card and need it at the same time of the Wi-FIBesides that, this is a good product, it helps you when you travel not carrying your laptop to keep in touch using your e-mail"
2,Didn't Last Long,"I set up a Wi-Fi hotspot in my home. Now I can pull up the Internet from my PDA anywhere inside and outside the house. For example, I was putting up a tree swing and needed to know how to tie a knot. I pulled out my PDA with the Wi-Fi card and Googled a site on knots. I followed the directions without having to go inside and look it up.The card is a battery hog, but it does have a feature to shut itself off after a period of time.Unfortunately, the card malfunctioned just past its warranty date. As usual, I couldn't get a response from Palm. I think my next PDA will not be Palm. They may have grown too big too fast and have forgotten customer service."
5,an excellent overview of difficult subject matter,"As an out-line of how a multiple sees the world outside, this is a good read. Some of these things are quite true to what I know regarding my own internal system, and some are not. I'm a Christian multiple trying to heal, and thought of myself as a walking ""contradiction in terms"". I know now that at 6 months of age I had few options for survival. You have to draw from the options available. I chose life over death. I'm a surviver. And I still choose life."
5,A wonderful insightful book on DID/MPD,"I have DID/MPD and I found this book to be quite useful and informative. My husband liked it just as much as I did. I would recommend this book to hand out to family and friends so that they can have a better understanding of what DID/MPD is. Hocking explains DID/MPD in layman terms that everyone can understand. She gives the reader some ""do's and don'ts"" in dealing with someone with DID/MPD. A great book for someone who has just been diagnosed with the condition. Hopeful outcome! THUMBS UP!!"
1,get a proofreader!!!,"The unbelievably poor grammar was so confusing that I often lost the plot line..story kind of interesting but seemed to have a lot of disconnects too...or maybe it was just the grammatical blocks. I thought it may have been (poorly) translated from another language, but that does not seem to be the case."
1,So glad I'm not the only one...,"I have to wonder about the motives and experience of those who gave this book a decent review. While I could suspend judgement about the facts in the story (not being an expert in plutonium or radiation sickness, etc.), I could not ignore the numerous and completely distracting grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors. Did anyone even proofread this book before it was published? I also agree with those reviewers who thought the plot and character development were thin, at best. An interesting idea that would have made a much more interesting book in the hands of a more gifted writer and diligent researcher."
2,Ignore the cheerleading- save your money.,"Not having read any reviews,I took the plunge and picked this one up from the discount rack at an airport. I realized shortly that I must have picked up one of the editions that was rushed to the publisher. I began to ""dog-ear"" pages with gross spelling errors, and I can only hope, after counting off 75 pages, that ""Dr."" Davis uses more caution in his medical practice. The dust jacket reviews suggest deep research into the subject matter. I didn't see any evidence of this , with the exception of a few easily obtainable Russian phrases. I also realized that those reviewing for the dust jacket must have been the Author's drinking buddies. (By the way, I quizzed several teenagers on the proper spelling of the noted errors, and most were able to see them.) In fairness to Dr. Davis' effort, the story was catchy. I feel perhaps that he would have been better served by selling the concept to another writer."
1,not a good read at all,"I can see that the majority of people who have read this book liked it, but I couldn't get through it without a lot of effort. I maybe could've lived with the terrible editing if the writing style and story had been decent, but I found neither to be true, so it was a real struggle for me to read. I admit I skipped a lot just to get through it. Obviously many people liked it, but if you haven't read it and want to do so, you might want to try and get it from the library just in case you find it as bad as I did."
3,Exciting Thriller - But Rather Far-Fetched,"Robert Davis seems to be attempting to emulate Robert Ludlum in this fast moving thriller... He falls rather short of Ludlum however... Too bad Mr. Davis didn't take the time to finish the story however... The ending really leaves one hanging and sort of frustrated... Who came out, the Lady or the Tiger???"
4,Not bad .I could have done worse,I'll have to admitt it was not the best book I've ever read but it was up there. At times the book got boring but would quickly right itself and move on. I did however like the background info in the begining and thought that was intresting and needed because in many good guy bad guy books there's just the bad guy with his sinisture plot and no back-up for his actions. This book provides that character background info needed for a good plot. Mr.Davis I believe you did a good job but hopefully your next book the Doomsday Kiss will be better.
1,"Highly predictable, unpolished in style","Ignoring typos, verb tense inconsistencies and a lack of general proof-reading, I'm sorry to be at odds with the ""5-star"" reviewers. The story conflict was trite and simplistic, the action was of ""comic book"" hero proportions, and the outcomes were predictable. The ""cliff-hanger"" endings of many of the chapters were superficial. Story potential was superior, the execution was greatly disappointing. Sorry to disagree - this is NO Clancy suspense novel!"
1,Not a Clancy,"Nowhere near a Clancy! Too much of nothing but filler, persons wanting excitement need to read something else."
1,A BAD book,A poorly written book and not tangible plot equals nothing but disaster for this book. The book has more spelling errors and geographical misplacement than any book I have had the ability to read. I hope the good doctor is a better practitioner than writer. I tend to agree with some of the other people here that the idea for the book would have been better being pitched to another author. The ending is somewhat short of complete and leaves you wondering what happened?
1,The author doesn't know how to end a story.,"I reread the last 3 chapters along with the first 5 times trying to come up with the ending. Was this a ""lead in"" to another novel? If so, say so! I am a Clive Cussler fan. I believe that Robert is very close to the Master. I thought that this was an otherwise outstanding novel. I heard Robert Davis interviewed on KLPW radio, Union, Mo. This is why I bought the book. An explanation from Robert about the ending would turn me into an avid reader of his books.mperkins@mail.usmo.com"
1,The Grammer & Spelling Are HORRIFYING!,"I read a lot. I love to read. I read all types of books. But this book is ridiculous! I couldn't hold out past chapter three! The grammer, the lack of proper punctuation, and then to make matters worse, the prominent use of ""their"" for the word ""there""! I finally slammed the book down in disgust! Was there no editor? Did no one even try to read the book before it was printed? Did they just run spell-check and tell it to ""ignore"" the errors found? The author, editor and publisher should all be ashamed. And anyone who wasted their hard-earned money on this book should demand a full refund (can we get extra money back for our pain and suffering?!?)."
5,superb,"This is great music.starts slow and builds and slows builds and slows its a journey.Dark and moody. Improvised jazz but its great. These guys know each other so well they just play off each other.they create this other worldly down tempo almost menacing music.this is the soundtrack for stalking and killing, both scary and creepy.like nothing you have heard before. Dont listen if you are mentally unstable, or like the music of Justin Beaver.This is dangerous music."
3,Recess is so so...,"This book is written in a mediocre style that is neither appealing nor exceptional in any way. It seems to me that a hard-core southerner moves to Alaska and is trying to impress the relatives back home with our winters.Not a bad book, but definitely nothing stands out in it as being special."
5,Excellent,"Book was well written and extremely interesting. it exceeded my expectation. If a person has any interest in the King Phillip War, I highly recommend reading this book."
5,Fantastic insight to the real you!!!!!!,"Sylvia Sheppard demonstrates a real grasp into our inner selves in this book. I followed the simple instructions which are definitely user friendly and I was astonished at how simple the whole process really is. The calculations were very easy to work out and the book is rather enjoyable to complete. The actual personality discriptions were fab, they really grasped your whole self and you do not need to be a Psychology grad to understand the book. I found that each of the four sections dipped into my inner self from different angles and after completing the book I did get to understand myself much better.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to search into who they really are. However this book is not only for reflecting internally it can actually guide you into making better career options, decisions and so forth. The book also can be a great present, it looks good and makes the person feel great."
4,Belly Dance workout,"I use this often. It is good for a quick workout, uses dance and weights and gives you a good mix of both."
4,"hey, it's all right","I'm not into the New York art and theatre scene, and I was expecting something more along the lines of ""American Arts Quarterly,"" which has more theoretical articles and is focused exclusively on visual arts without any political overtones. However, I forced myself to read through the first several issues and found that there were articles I liked. Now I look forward to getting issues in my mailbox. I still don't read theatre reviews, which are tedious as a species. Recommended, but if you are really looking for an art journal that is conservative (in a non-political sense), go with ""American Arts Quarterly"" from the Newington-Cropsey Institute."
2,An attempt failed!,"A very interesting movie if you don't want to relate it to the book. However, if you have read the book prior to watching this movie you will know the obvious flaws. Movie emphasizes on Grushenka and Demitri, and the struggle between them and the father Karamazov. The book takes more philosophical approach and fulfills a purposeful debate about the existence of God. If I had to chose between the book and the movie- I would chose the book without thinking twice. I recommend the viewer to read the book before watching the book. This will help him see the shortcomings of the movie."
4,One of the best classicals,Brothers Karamazov is one of the best DVD s and this DVD has excellent acting and cinematography. I wish the resolution of the DVD had been better.
5,"Marilyn Monroe wanted to play GRUSHENKA in this movie, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV","This was the movie for which Marilyn Monroe wanted desperatelythe role of Grushenka, the sexy girl in the movie. She wantedthis role to prove her acting ability. But it was not to happen.Well, maybe it was for the better ...since she filmed in 1958the role of Sugar Kane Kowalcyk, in SOME LIKE IT HOT.But one wonders what Grushenka would have been like played byMarilyn Monroe, seducing Lee J. Cobb and Yul Brynner."
5,Meshtastic!,"If you haven't checked out this band yet, do it now! And this double album is probably the best to start with. Catchy synth pop songs with great lyrics. Sounds simple but their music is more complicated than that!"
1,dvd review,"Wasn't able to view this DVD because it was made for use outside of the U.S. If I'm purchasing item in the U.S. and your shipping it to an address in the U.S. this should have never happened. I am displeased and will probably never do business with your company in the future. You can say it left a sour taste in my mouth. Thank You, Jose."
3,The book slightly misrepresents itself,"The author spends a lot of time telling you that many homework assignments are trivial, and it is not so tragic if your child doesn't do them all. This may be true, but the problem remains - how do I get my kid to do the assignment? I didn't think the author had anything to say that I didn't already know."
3,Five Finger Whiner,"Book definitely not a self-help manual. Doesn't give insight into the real disorders such as kleptomania, impulse control, or addictive behaviors. It's one man's account of he only made a small mistake and was miraculously cured. In the real world, therapists call this a throne of lies. Save your money and time."
1,Confused about intention....,i bought this book after contacting the author to request information for my sister who was caught shoplifting twice in three years. i had hoped she would find some help in this book and in the group that is referred to. unfortunately my sister was not able to find much information in the book or from the author and has since located a specialist in the field who also happens to have authored two very concise and informative books that have helped her find professional help from real psychiatric specialists in impulse control. i hope others will seek help from actual doctors. this book is a lame attempt to get the information out and it is unfortunate that the author is not a true md who can treat people. that is what people really need.
1,Like no other recovery book I've read,"I am an addictions counselor at a highly respected treatment center in the midwest. After reading an article written by Mr. Shulman in our treatment center quarterly periodical I was interested enough to purchase his book. I would love to say that the book is written in a manner that will help people in recovery, but unfortunately i don't feel that it is. The book does not model the most basic, well known, and successful recovery model - the 12 step program. Mr. Shulman is writing from first person perspective. The book is more of a bio than a self-help book. (...)"
2,Misunderstood Disorder,"Kleptomania and compulsive shoplifting are both rare conditions that are hard to distinguish from each other. Most people do not seek help when they are stealing unless the courts have told them to because they are so ashamed of their actions. I began therapy on my own because I realized that I did have a problem. I was hopeful this book would provide new insight and therapeutic details, both individual therapy that works and pharmaceutical therapy that works or shows promise but the book did not give any new insight. I am still searching for help with the problem I have. At least the author is bringing some attention to the problem though; there are only three or four books written on this subject and there must be thousands who suffer like i do."
1,Not a 12-step program in any sense...,"I recieved a rather nasty e-mail from a supporter of Mr. Shulman deriding my review of this book. I returned to check my words to see if I had shared any untruths or poison, but my first review seems to have been deleted! I wrote to Mr. Shulman as a member of a recovery program and asked if his program was similar (the 12-step method), he recommended his book. Upon recieving it I read first thru the chapter on the 12-steps and found that he (the author) dismisses the method, the spiritual aspect,and the informal meetings with no professional class. I trust this review will remain to help the next 12-step member seeking help for a friend."
5,Misconceptions about shoplifting - To explain is not to excuse.,"Shoplifting is one of those hidden behaviors that only occasionally surfaces into public awareness, usually the result of a high profile celebrity ""acting out"". Terrence Shulmans book reveals the underlying reasons that ""petty-theft"" can no longer be dismissed as a harmless blemish on society. Shoplifting is surrounded by misconceptions that not only underestimate its magnitude but contribute to the lack of serious attempts to view it as a problem. It is harmful at an individual and social level. As a recovering shoplifter Mr. Shulman has a genuine understanding of the inner psychological dynamics of the often addictive behavior. ""Something for Nothing"" doesn't sugar coat this type of theft, but offers a means by which those who wish to change can navigate their way out of the maze of their compulsion. As a treatment provider with over ten years of working with shoplifting offenders, I highly recommend his book."
1,Just Do It!,There is one thing that compulsive shoplifters need to do and it is very simple - STOP. Pay like the rest of us do. Who needs a book to know this?
2,Public Perception Wont Change,"Shulman's books that speak about shoplifting and theft addiction and employee theft give him a reason to live -- to try to get the idea that these issues are widespread across to the general public. He says that in his opinion the urges to take items that don't belong are as strong as any other addiction a person can have, to drugs, alcohol, work. Even though he tries to get the world to buy into his philosophy that this is an addiction, it will never happen. The court system, the stores who lose millions, and almost every person alive who has never stolen in their life won't care why a person steal, only that it is a criminal activity and illegal. Even if these people need help, the general public doesn't get it. A commandment says it is wrong, so it is wrong. A commandment doesn't say drinking or drugs or work is wrong. There will always be a disconnect."
5,Great Phone,This phone is awesome. The reception is great and the Caller ID makes the phone even better. This phone has the most bang for the buck. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
4,This is an excellent phone!,I have had this phone for 18 months and I love it!!!! We bought several and returned them including a Sony. They all had a horrible echo that I couldn't stand. This Uniden has no echo and the reception is clear. The only complaint that I have is the battery is starting to go. It has lasted quite a while but I think a battery should have a longer life!I would highly recommend this phone!
1,Bad Battery,"I purchase this phone as a Xmas gift for my roommate. She didn't set it up until mid-February. Now, only 2 months after she started using it, the battery has died. My Sanyo phone did the same thing, but it lasted over a year before this happened."
1,Phone didn't work....at all!,"I pulled the phone out of the box, plugged it in and...nothing. It didn't work. Don't waste your money on this phone."
1,going back to Panasonic,I have had my Uniden phone for 4 months and the battery is gone. I am never buying anything but Panasonic from now on. I have never had problems with my Panasonic phones and don't know why I bought another brand.
3,Don't print directly to the printer...,"Pros: Easy to use, fast, versatile, good quality when scanning to a file (color and b/w)Cons: Image prints appear faded and washed out when sent directly to a printerWanted to use the RICOH IS200e combined with a color laser printer to function sort of as a color copier. When scanning to a file, the image quality and colors are perfect, but when sending directly to a printer, the image prints faded and washed out.I e-mailed Ricoh support about this problem, thinking it might be something in my setup or maybe a driver issue, and they responded as such: ""Regrettably the capabilities of using this equipment as color a copier are limited.""For the price and supposed features of this scanner, I would think that Ricoh would at least bother to acknowledge the existence of such a LARGE problem, rather than just writing it off as being ""beyond specified capabilities."""
1,GOSPEL MUSIC BUT THE PAGE JUMP TO A NETHER PAGE.,AM LOOKING FOR CLARA WARD WARD SINGER BUT IT NEVER GOT THERE.SO I CAN NOT REAL RATE THE SING SOMEONE WAS TALL ME ABOUT THE SING LIKE TO HEAR IT.BUT FOR I RATE IT I LIKE TO HEAR IT. TELL ME HOW TO FIX TO THE PROBLEM?
1,Wrestling???,"A bad attempt to make wrestling erotic. Wearing a singlet doesn't make anyone a wrestler, which is exactly what any of these guys are. If you enjoy wrestling as a sport this is not what you are looking for, believe me."
4,"Works fine, easy to use, a couple of disappointments","I've owned this player for 2 years now and use it almost daily to listen to podcasts. So, I am constantly erasing all the files and starting over. The two things that I've been disappointed about:1. Even though it has 256MB it always quits accepting files after 150-180MB of data have been downloaded.2. It will not play files from an SD card at all. So, I cannot expand it."
3,Worked Great.....for a little while,"Worked perfectly for about 6 months. Dropped it once on cement and it was curtains for the mp3 player. Also doesn't recognize folders. Other than that, I was happy with it until it passed away."
4,X-cellent 1st Buy,"Purchased this player over a month ago and was skeptical from reading the reviews. After receiving it, this has been everything that I need in a 1st mp3 player...price being #1. No complications when adding songs, play time is excellent considering only 1 battery and very small in size. I use it for working out & long trips on my motorbike.Only one thing I would change:1. Backlight screenWonderful 1st buy!!!!!!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I've had this player for approx 5 months and for the last month it only works when it wants to. Most of the time I have to lay it flat and not touch any buttons for it to work properly. The headphone/earbud thingy's hurt my ears so I sprang for a pair of phillips behind the head phones and the sound is better. It's awful touchy. If I bump the table I'm at or touch any button at the wrong time, it shuts off and I have to spin the battery or take it out and replace it. I've only dropped it once (about 3 feet onto a carpeted floor) and it played just fine after that. I use it at work since I have a sit-down job in a large quiet environment. My next player will be a samsung or an ipod.Ok so this is an update, I was able to solder new connections to the battery compartment and seems to be working fine now. Still wouldn't buy again."
1,defective item,"I cannot rate this item as it was defective! I called RCA and they said this was common in this MP3 player. I hesitated to re-order it from Amazon, but took a chance anyway and then the response from them was that I wouldnt receive this item until mid May!!! I, of course, cancelled the order. What I do know is that the songs would not download to the player from my computer. I have an updated windows ME version, but RCA said that wasnt the problem. My friend however, ordered this same player and hers works just fine, she says she loves it. Very basic, great for the MP3 player ""impaired"" as I understand. So good luck and hope yours works!!!"
4,nice little mp3 player,bought this a few years ago and it still works....great little music player but the ear plugs hurt so you need to buy something more comfortable but otherwise the music plays great and loud when you want it loud. would recommend for the price.
4,RCA Lyra RD1072 256 MB Personal MP3 Player,"This is my fourth mp3 player. I like the fact that it is powered by a AAA battery. I use rechargeable batteries and always carry extra charged ones with me in a plastic film case. It does'nt hold a lot of songs, but I can always delete them and replace them with new ones from my computer music library. It also has very good volume with easy to work controls on the side. The ID tag is in rather big type so it's easy to read, but you can usually only see the last couple of words in the title after the song is playing. It also shows the elapsed time of the song. I like the navigation on my RCA 4 GB player the best."
4,great for the kids,"Bought this as a christmas presents for my kids for 2 reasons: it was cheap, and it was a brand I trusted. It is very easy to load songs on, works just like a thumb drive, only with a cord you plug in. Drag and drop songs from windows explorer and go. Says it will hold 160 songs, fine print: if encoded at 56 kpbs. Most music is 124 to 192 kpbs, so it really holds about 60 songs unless you want to take the time to encode at a lower bitrate. Still, for my kids 60 songs seems like a lot, and it was only $15. Now lets see if it lasts more than a year."
1,Horrible with podcasts,"If you plan to listen to podcasts or other longer music files on your mp3 player, avoid this product.There is no ""resume"" function, so if you have one file that is 30 minutes long, and you stop in the middle to come back later, you will have to start over again at the beginning of the file and fast-forward through the file to find your spot.But, there are 3 problems with fast-forwarding:1 - The fast forward button is the same button as the ""next track"" so if you accidentally jiggle your finger you will skip ahead to the next track.2 - The button requires a lot of force to press and hold down. It starts to hurt my hand after a few minutes.3 - Fast-forwarding is sloooooow. It takes about 6-7 seconds to FF one minute of audio, so to FF 15 minutes into an audio file would require 90 seconds of holding down the button.This thing is really frustrating."
1,"bad quality, non-existent service!","BUYER BEWARE!!!I'm not the only one with this complaint. The Lyra keeps breaking, jamming up in the middle of playback and nothing will make it play except to remove the battery and put it back in. Which is no good when you're in the middle of your workout or your hands are busy. Then it may play for 30 seconds or 30 minutes before it jams up again. Usually about 3 songs, it seems.I sent it back already once. The customer service line is NOT toll free and they take forever to answer it. They took a month to get me another one, and the second one came with the cheapest, worst headphones ever made. The first one had great headphones. Then the second Lyra broke just like the first one. I'm about to go buy a different brand. Customer service won't respond to my request for the better headphones I payed for. They didn't fix their product. And I will never buy another RCA product again."
4,A Definite Good Buy,"I've had my Lyra for almost two years and have had a great experience with it. Aside from some minor issues-- freezed a few times during the middle of a track or two, and would shut-off on a few occasions-- it's great. I also had dropped it in the weight room and dislodged something inside. It rattles sometimes but still works like a champ. The 512mb SD flash card is more than enough space to put together a good mix to keep you jammin during a workout, and the battery life isn't too shabby for a single AAA. For the price it's limp peter, you can't beat it."
1,Beware! Old and Used Tent from Amazon!,"To be honest, I was excited that I was going to get my first tent and I plan to use it really soon. However, after I received it today, I was surprised to find out that the condition of the tent was in. It was not new at all and as matter of fact, it was very used. The carrying bag has dirt/grass over it. The tent was folded nicely in a box to fool me to think that it was new but once I opened up the tent, I notice that the tent has probably been used many times. I guess it was a customer-returned item before. I am a regular customer of Amazon. It's not my first time that I received an used product from Amazon but this time the condition of this tent was just not acceptable (I would probably find a newer tent in a thrifty store). Needless to say, I am returning this but the shipping charge will be costly and straight coming out of my pocket. What a disappointing experience."
4,Corben at the top of his form,"The story is ordinary. It takes place in a world with Nar stones, like the ones that drove the Heavy Metal movie. They are a source of great power, coveted by evil men. Den becomes involved, to save his friends and the woman he loves, or so he thinks.OK, it's your basic sword 'n' sorcery kind of plot. Airships, deranged hermits, terrible beasts - the usual. What's not usual is Corben's lush artwork. Den, the hero, is a superhuman figure of rippling sinews. Kath, like all women of this world, is a powerful figure of superhuman bosom. The monsters are evil, the escapes are narrow, and the mad mage is a whirling nutjob. His direst threat is ""The Nutcracker of Death.""Good adventure comic, great Corben art, not for folks shy of skin on display, but certainly not an ""adult"" comic. A classic, and still a favorite.//wiredweird"
4,Amazing polish,"This is a great product, it helped almost diminish the scratches and wet stains on the wood. It couldn't completely remove them specially the stains caused by coffee/tea. Though the polish is very easy to use."
2,just oily polish - but might have gotten it for wrong reasons,"I have light wood floors - just redone, and with furniture being moved around and kids coming over, lots scratches, rubbed off areas and scuffs. I saw this product for dark wood floors everywhere, but not light - so I paid premium to get it internet. Basically - once your finish is compromised, there is no going back. This product was like a heavy duty Pledge, but my scratches and rub outs - though shinier, were no less evident at the end of the day. Maybe I expected too much. Disappointed."
3,OK but Spendy Shipping,"I couldn't for the life od me find this product in a store - they only had the dark color avail so I had to buy it online, but the shipping was almost as much as the product. The product itself works great - got a lot of scratches to go away 9or look to go away) but the shipping fee is just too much."
5,Swear by this,I had the Old English scratch cover for dark woods for my coffee table and got this for my floors after the movers put a huge scratch in them when we moved. You can't even tell where the scratch was unless you know where to look. Definitely a lot cheaper to buy a bottle of this than to have to floors refinished. Highly recommend!
4,Works,I moved into a house where the finish on the kitchen cabinets had rubbed off. This product and the dark version brought the cabinets back to life.
4,A good start in subduing scratches on floors,I ordered this product based on a few very positive reviews. It worked well on superficial scratches but i discovered that also applying a floor polish and/or refinisher with a flat finish versus gloss did a much better job of subduing the scratches from my dogs on the wood floors. Lighting and natural light accentuates the scratches and gloss finishes make them even more obvious. I now use old english scratch remover to touch up newer scratches after cleaning the floors -then apply a good liquid refinisher or polish and voila - my scratches seem all but gone. One note: when applying old english a bit of elbow grease is required and on deeper scratches- 2-3 applications for it to take.Old English Furniture Polish: Scratch Cover for Light Wood 8 OZ
4,Great stuff,"I just used this on an old honey oak dresser. My husband walked passed it and could not believe the difference. It doesn't look like new, but the appearance of this much loved piece is much improved."
5,Great Product,"This scratch cover really works well. I thought that we were going to have to have our cabinets resurfaced, but I found out that by using this product on a regular basis it solved our problem and saved us a lot of money."
4,Drop dead...,"I purchased Visionary Complex due to a little magazine called Newgrave. I had picked it up one afternoon when I visited a Tower Records because there was an article about London After Midnight. Either way Fear Cult was the band on the cover and after several months of sitting around on my bum I decided to go on Amazon and finally buy their album. I wasn't exactly sure of what to expect but sure enough two to three business days later it arrived on my door step.The music is extremely campy as well as the bands image, but over all I enjoy the album. There is an interesting cover of Safety Dance, originally performed by Men Without Hats. The album is a decent, although it is not the best in modern goth."
3,A decent addition to my collection,"This is a pretty good CD by deathrock band Fear Cult. Though Im not 100% sure Id call it deathrock, its VERY electronic based. Still has some catchy stuff on it though. If you buy this youre most likely not going to be blown away, youll hear some catchy songs here and there but nothing thats gonna make you obsess over them. I enjoy the CD, Im glad I got it, but its easily topped by other modern deathrock bands."
4,Every Little Bit Helps,"Improving Reading Comprehension, Grade 3 has a wide variety of short blurbs--fiction, nonfiction and fantasy--with a wide variety of completion exercises. I really like the book for quick assessments and for homework. Many kids can read words, but I find that too many have difficulty understanding what they have read. The content and length of the pieces are quite well suited to third graders. Steck-Vaughn does a great job.I couldn't find ""83"" activities as described on the cover. I only found 46 and would love to have more. Perhaps someone could clarify this for me."
1,Mistitled,"I bought this book thinking that it would cover the subject of Religious Humanism. After reading the introduction, however, I feel as though the author has deliberately set about to confuse the term. At first I thought that the author might have been simply ignorant of the historical use of the term ""Religious Humanism"" as defined in documents such as the 1933 ""Humanist Manifesto I"". With statements like ""religious humanists [...] go about their work without much taste for manifestos"", however, I do not believe that ignorance can be blamed. Readers will be disappointed to find that this is a work on liberal theism, not Religious Humanism."
3,Black & Decker,"Although this product is working ( for now!), I have been dissapointed in B&D's quality slide over the years. I now make it a point to look for another brand and eliminate Black & Decker entirely when shopping"
5,i hour charge?,an excellent and cost effective upgrade instead of the lame charger that comes with Black & Decker products.well worth the extra price.eliminates frustration from waiting on regular charger.most charges take less.good to bring on jobs.
4,Battery Charger Review,"Product works great but made a high pitched noise when certain batteries were charging, other than that it charges very rapidly"
4,charges fast!,"This charger works really fast. My only complaint is the high-pitched noise it emits while charging. My husband can't even hear it, but it drives me nuts!"
4,Great Charger,"For the money, this is a great buy. It charges quickly and, for me, I can leave the charged battery in the charger without harming it."
4,Battery Charger 1 Hr,"I'm very happy with this battery charger. I wish I had know about it before as I burned up two battery's and a old type charger. This lets me know if the battery is taking a charge or it is a bad battery. The fast charge (1 Hr) lets me not but the battery in the charge before I need to use it and it will be ready when I need it and I can also leave it in the charger and it will not over charge it or burn up the battery or charger. This item should be put in the products operation books to let us know about it. Keep putting these products out, as now I can use your products more. Thank You."
4,nice unit,"Very nice little charger. Way better than the stock piece of junk I got with the tools. On a side note: If you think your battery is bad...after charging your battery test the voltage output. If it doesn't read a voltage at least as much as it's rated output i.e. 14.4, 12.0 etc it probably has a dead cell. And no... I do not believe that those magical battery re-conditioners actually work ! ! !"
5,This is the charger that should have been included with the drill,"This charger works like a battery charger for cordless tools should. I recharged all three of my batterys in just over an hour, it will tell you if there is a problem with the battery so you don't wast time trying to recharge a battery that won't take a charge, and you can leave a battery in the charger and it will keep it toped off with out over charging it. B&D should have sharged a little more an included this charger with there cordless tools insted of the dud the send with it now."
4,great buy,"THis was easy shopping. This charger was not available anywhere else and it was necessary to keep my husbands drill working. If we could not get this item, we would have had to purchase a new drill. It saved time and money to order on line. I will be ordering again."
4,great products,"This is the cheapest replacement of my battery charger that I can find anywhere. It works very very well, much better than the original one."
5,Battery Charger,Just what I needed; the time from placing the order and recieving it was very short. Very statisfied with the whole process.
5,works just as expected,"Enough said. This works exactly as I expected. I had previously bought and older plug and cord charger that would actually drain my batteries of life if I left it plugged in. With this model, I can leave the battery in the charger until I need to use it."
5,Much better than the standard charger,I almost bought a standard replacement charger but then I read a review about how bad they are and it recommended this charger. Indicator lights told me that one of my batteries was shot. Other indicator lights let you know when the battery is fully charged - usually in 1 hour. Totally worth the money.
1,poor description by both B&D and Amazon,"I bought this to replace a missing charger for my PS130 12V battery. What the description doesn't tell you is that this charger is specific to a squared off tip. Mine has a piece of plastic that juts out from the side and doesn't allow the battery to fit all the way down in the charger. Be ware! My battery says PS130 Power Pack Type 3 12V. If you have one of these, don't waste your money. It will not fit."
5,Great Charger,I have been using this charger for some time. It works great and I would recommend. It keeps my batteries charged and in working condition.
4,Nice Product,"Works exactly as described. I lost the charger for a drill I had and was about to throw it away till I found this. Glad I bought it, it was good to have an extra drill when building my deck for anyone who cared to come over and help."
5,14.4V battery charger,"Totally outperforms the original charger that came with the tool (3/8"" drill). Recharge in an hour or less; able to continue working without having to worry about energy consumption."
4,Glad I Read The Reviews,"I have become an avid review reader and once again it has paid off. I was in need of a new charger for my older but still very functional drill. Initially I was going to just replace the charger that came with the drill, til I read the reviews. I thank all of you that take the time to write a review. This charger is all that I had hoped for and then some. It made for a quick charge (probably less than an hour) on my battery that had been completely dead for sometime. Battery has held it's charge so all is well. I would recommend this charger anytime. It works wonderfully - far better than the original equipment that came with the drill."
4,good charger,"great charger, good on all different battery sizes/voltages, could not beat this price on Pod style type. Glad I found it."
2,Not satisfied,"When I got the charger it did not work. I tried it on two batteries and neither one would charge. It would flash constantly when plugged up, but no charge. Waiting on my refund, but have not received it."
1,Amazon Can't or won't Deliver,"I'm very surprised but, Amazon apparently has some new companies they are using for shipping. One of their new shippers, Velocity Express, claims to have delivered 2 of these to my home, the original and the replacement. They NEVER delivered either one. Instead of contacting Velocity Express and taking care of this, the csr says all they can do is give a refund. The 1st csr I spoke to after the 2nd non delivery said they won't send another one because they just wouldn't deliver it again. Amazon...what's happened to you?"
3,"Not bad, could be better though.","I've owned this charger for a while now, and it does a pretty good job of charging up my 14.4v Dewalt and Firestorm batteries quickly. I don't care for B&D;'s method of indicating the charge status on batteries. The flashing light is ok, but having some sort of series of lights or varying colors would have been a better choice. As mentioned earlier, this unit is not rated to charge 18v packs and does not ""condition"" the batteries as does the Dewalt unit.The charger is leaps and bounds above the standard cheap charger that comes with most of the B&D; tools, and for the money, its not a bad investment. If you are looking for conditioning capability or the ability to eventually move up to 18v products, buy the Dewalt."
5,Does the job,My original charger quit working and I checked local retail stores for a replacement and found that a new charger cost almost as much as I paid for product initially. It would have been cheaper to just buy a new cordless drill.I found this new charger at Amazon and the cost incl. shipping was very reasonable.The item was shipped quickly and it worked right out of the box.I actually like this charger better than the one that came with the drill.
5,Fast!,Got this for my husband to replace the one that came with his drill. Replaced the original one once before and decided to buy this one when we needed to replace it again. Very fast charge and love that it tells you when your battery is bad. Would definately recommend this product
4,Black and Decker PS1MVC 8.4 to 14.4 Volt charger,"The charger came quickly and well packed. I confirm that it works with 12 Volt battery for B&D Drill and can be used instead of PS160 that came with the set and was recently burned. The charging process was as the following: after 15 minutes charging the lamp stopped blinking and I tried my drill. It looked like the battery had been charged for about 30%. I put the battery back into charger and the lamp started blinking again. That process was repeated 3 times. So it means that to fully charge the battery you have to put it into charger and pull it back 3-4 times. Anyway, the battery had been charged and I was able to use my drill again."
5,Found it!!,"wonderful, love the product. The drill had been useless for months since the original charger died, I was thrilled to find a replacement on line thru Amazon!!! Working great!!"
4,Should be sold with the tools.,"The charger that originally came with my drill is a piece of crap, as are generally the cheapo chargers that come with rechargeable tools. The charger I had to buy does an excellent job and is solid. The tool sellers should provide this type of charger in the first place."
5,A great TV!,"This TV has a great picture quality. The picture is great. The sound is awesome. Eventhough it is very expansive for a TV but if you have the money, this is great TV to own. If the lights are out and your watching a movie on this TV it feels like you are at a movie theater."
4,earphone clips for the wireless earphones,"Any one know where I can get the plastic replacement ear clips for the wireless earphones? One of the plastic clips broke while I was attaching it to the eaphone. I tried calling RCA(Audiobox) and talked with several people who stated that they would get back to me and to date(two weeks), no one has. It's just a very small inexpensive piece of plastic but without it the wireless earphones do not stay in place when I run. Need help.""Wired"" runner"
1,needs lots of improvements,"The wireless headphones were a good idea, but are to cumbersome, heavy and very uncomfotable! 1 gig is way to small."
1,Not for high humidity,"The wireless earphones lasted about two weeks in the South Florida summer.The viewing screen went screwy about two weeks after that.For the top item that comes up under a ""sports mp3 player"" search, this item is not robust. I'm used to replacing mp3 payers every 6 months-1 year. My Ipod nano lasted almost 2 years so maybe that's still the best value."
1,Plain.,"There's nothing special about her.She has blonde hair and tanned skin, making her look slightly awkward.Honestly, I would suggest On Ice Dana, who is easily the prettiest out of the lot.Her clothes are simple too."
5,great knives,"these are great knives and haven't worn out at all in a year. both are still pretty sharp and come razor sharp! do require tightening every couple uses but other wise, awesome!"
3,"Great picture, but $$$ bulb, no HD tuner, no HDMI audio","The picture is great, but the bulb costs around $250 to replace, and goes out every 1-2 years. You cannot receive over the air HDTV broadcasts using an antenna, because of analog only receiver, and I've never been able to obtain audio through the HDMI connection. Great television except for those rather important oversights."
5,"Study of times, people, animals and goodness","This story of a good man who made a good life for himself, his family and his animals, built from circumstances that were to say the least, less than the best, is a case study in human nature.I cannot help but contrast Dr. Key with Michael Vic. Key was a man born into slavery and from that experience, chose to treat all life with respect. He and his horse became a catalyst for the change in public sentiment that came as a result of his goodness toward animals and activity the American Humane Movement. Michael Vic who, when given a life of plenty, choose the opposite path. It seems to be a sad commentary.I must heartily endorse the book. It is a good story and a good read."
5,A Thinking Horse and His Man,"This is an excellent and accurate account of a horse that learned to spell and do simple math. It is also an amazing story of the emancipated slave who trained him. It gives an excellent history of the time after the civil war. It changed my view of what is possible. I was taught in psychology 101 that the horse Gentle Hans was a fraud and that he had learned to pick up unconscious cues from his trainer, that he wasn't really able to think. Beautiful Jim Key proved without a doubt that he was able to spell and do math and make change. Wonderful history."
5,This book will answer all your equine nutrition questions,"I can't say enough about this book. These days we are bombarded with these ads for supplements the manufacturers insist our horses must have! But we can cause real problems if we don't know what we are doing. Too much of this? Not enough that? We can cause serious damage. This book will tell you exactly what your horse needs by taking in all kinds of factors such as how much work he does, where he lives, etc.Easy to read, easy to understand. Buy this book!"
4,Check it!,"This album is cool don't get me wrong, but the album that I like is ""Gang banning poetry"". If anyone can help me find it get at me on my e-mail. Don't forget to get this disc you'll like it. I'm out people!"
1,dont waste ur time n money,hard shell=easy to break=waste of ur money.mine broke in 2 weeks for no apparent reason.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC.
4,great for the price,"I got my case in the mail yesterday, and it fits my L7 like a glove. The only down points are that the screen is exposed, and the case is a bit difficult to put on/remove. Because I just got it, I haven't had a chance to see how well it keeps dirt out. Overall, this case is great, especially for the price."
3,Playwrights,Good Reference guide which can give you an opening the the mind of a playwright an why he or she does the things they do when writing.
2,"The price is nice ""BUT""","I bought this coffee maker for the speed it claimed and the price.I will not make that mistake again.About every 30 minutes the element comes on to heat the water inside up and it gets louder every day,sounds like a jet engine after about a month.I will be reading reviews before purchasing another brand."
2,Momentum,I'm sure the Momentum is the usual Mellita quality but it's too big for the average kitchen!!
1,"Run Away, Run Away","Took a chance on this machine for $20...a disaster on every level. First off, there's some bizarre pre-use preparation step you have to take which takes 20 minutes. It leaks water everywhere, and (get this), by the time I was able to get it going 45 minutes later and bleed a cup of coffee out of this monstrosity, the machine turned off.And never turned back on. No lights nothing. It doesn't work, and I argue whether it ever did.Needless to say, this thing is on its way back to Amazon as I type."
1,Machine and coffee are luke-warm,"We purchased this machine at a Melitta factory store 2 months ago, and we have been disapponted with it. If the machine is accidentally unplugged, it does take about 15 minutes for the water to be heated. Even after doing so, the coffee made is not very hot and the warmer plate doesn't seem to help. One would think that the ""quick brew"" feature would mean the coffee would be nice and hot -- where the heating element is always on keeping the water hot, but that has not been our experience. I have to put the cup in the microwave to warm it up. It also isn't really any faster than other machines we've had where you just pour in the water and start the cycle. The taste of the coffee is OK, but we have had other machines that overall were better. I am looking for a new machine."
1,Coffee Maker Defective II,"We had our coffee pot for less than one month. It quit working. My husband, who missed his coffee that morning, took the defective coffee pot and gently tossed it in the dumpster. Needless to say, I was unable to return it. If you are a serious coffee drinker - do not buy this coffee pot!"
1,Save your money,"I ordered this to replace a Kenmore coffee maker that was taking forever to brew a pot of coffee be it 2 cups or 10. The promise of speed really attracted me to this model and I thought for $20 I'd try it out. This is a huge appliance that took up a lot of counter space and as another reviewer mentioned there are several steps to go thru before you can even brew coffee. It worked wonderfully for 2 days.....then all it brewed was cold coffee and the warming plate never warmed. The only reason this got 1 star is because Amazon will not let you give a product 0 stars. Save your money, time, and aggravation."
1,Melitta Momentum Coffee Maker model MERB10B,"Well, was all excited to find something that brews as fast as the Bunn.Bought one on Ebay for $29.99. If you want a fire, then buy this. It leaks from the bottom and ends up sitting in a pool of water.Bummer!"
5,Awesome!,I ordered these for my hubby for Christmas. Got them within a good time window and think they look awesome. I cannot wait to see his face Christmas morning!
5,Mesmerize your toddler!,"I was doubtful a couple of years back when a friend encouraged me to buy this for my dog, who watches animals on TV. She said her toddler was captivated by it, and thought a doggy might be, too. Well, the dog didn't like it because it doesn't have doggy noises, but my 1 year old is entranced by it every time I put it on. In fact, one of the ways we now get her to sit still long enough to eat is to put it on. Nice music, great doggy faces. You might even find yourself watching! :)"
1,A ROUND OF PIES FOR THIS VIDEO,"As an inveterate, long term Beatles fan, it was only natural that I would want to view this video. Needless to say, I was highly displeased with the quality (or lack thereof) and Mr. Guiliano's long established career of smearing the Beatles. Mr. Guiliano is not well loved among the Beatle literati and this video will certainly help explain the reason for this.The interviews are lackluster; the filming quality is poor. Take the advise of all the other reviews and skip this one. Watch the Beatles First U.S. Visit, a Beatles' film or any other Beatles' related video instead."
1,A Whole Lot of Nothing!,"While no one can fault Giuliano for his research on the Beatles, this one should have remained in the dark! He has absolutely NO sense of production and the crew he assembled to shoot and edit this mess doesn't seem to have a clue on any level! When you hear someone talking about Yoko Ono, you see footage of Paul.. and that sort of ""presentation"" runs through the entire DVD!Sound levels are awful and Giuliano brings absolutely nothing to the screen when he wanders around Liverpool, pontificating ad nauseum.About the ONLY redeeming element in this mess is the segment of Pete Best.. and even that is obviously shot on home video and bumped down several generations at that.Wait for the Beatles Anthology on DVD -- THAT will be worth the wait and the money!"
1,"""Buyer's remorse"" guaranteed here","Luckily, I wasn't the unfortunate buyer in this case, but I feel bad for my friend who thought she was buying me a nifty Christmas present... The blurbs on the packaging promises a great documentary along the lines of The Compleat Beatles, and even during the initial scenes it's still easy to hold out hope for something good, but slowly but surely the realization sinks in that this documentary is all about stirring up anticipation without ever giving a payoff. One major strike against this film is that it contains no Beatles music, and the only exclusive interviews are with bit-players connected to the Beatles. The rest of the film consists of boring location shots overlaid with meaningless commentary interspersed with equally dull footage of random press conferences with solo Beatles... Geoffrey Guiliano has achieved what I would have thought impossible, in creating a boring film about the Beatles"
1,It's hard to believe a budget label would release this,"Paraphrasing a line George Harrison spoke in ""A Hard Day's Night"": The author of this DVD is a ""drag, a well-known drag...""Laserlight, the distributor of this DVD, handles cheap-o, marginal programs, at budget prices. But this is a new low, even for them. To saddle up with infamous Beatle-leech, Geoffrey Guiliano (the Jerry Springer of Beatles ""experts""), and distibute his childish and smarmy ""Celebration"" is below even their standards.Even for the price shown, this is a complete waste of money. There is absolutely nothing of value, interest or entertainment on this DVD. Purchasing it will only cause Guiliano to do this again.Avoid..."
3,Not bad!,"Geoffery Guiliano makes it his life to put out as much as he can about the life of The Beatles. I enjoyed the DVD because I like Geoffery and I think his enthusiasm shows when he talks about his passion, The Beatles. There currently is no other DVD with what is presented here. The clips have been previously released but not on DVD. Soon the Beatles Anthology will be released on DVD, but even some of the stuff on this DVD is not currently on The VHS version of The Beatles Anthology. You have to see it for what it is. It is not officially authorized by The Beatles and states that there is no music by The Beatles on it. If you want to hear Beatles music while watching it then ""put it on""! I am sure you have a CD player, put it on, man! To sum it up, I liked it! Buy it!"
2,Come on...,"What could I say. Pffft. I'm not a fan of this dvd. Grainy footage, poor sound quality, and this guy's vocabulary is huge and hard to understand. No music and hardly any Ringo. Heres something interesting I found... the menu on the DVD says ""Beatles Celebracion"" Come on! The editors are not in grade school here! They didn't even have access to Strawberry Fields. That was the funniest part. They just kept showing footage of the gate and the trees. Totaly a budget film. Use the extra money from this movie and buy one of the Beatles real videos like A Hard Days Night or Yellow Submarine."
1,I'd Prefer To Give It No Stars,This was a joke! The worse piece of work done on the Beatles that I have ever seen. If only my hand hitting the T.V. screen would actually of hit the annoying guy who created this load of garbage. Thank God I only paid a few dollars for it.
1,"In my honest opinion, the worst Beatles DVD in existence","Beatles-Celebration? There is nothing further from the truth with this DVD. Let me first of all say Im a huge Beatles fan and this DVD looks like it was made in someone's garage. Literally. The host is so obsessed with them (even wearing the Nehru jackets and following the ISKCON/Hindu guru ideals...coincedence?)that it becomes scary. You almost feel like you are watching a home video tribute..done by a stalker. The DVD shows very poor quality interviews. Yes, I mean ""look ma, Im on home video"" quality. Horrific. In fact, I don't even think that the DVD even uses Beatles music at all. Kinda ironic when you call the DVD a CELEBRATION and it's regarding a MUSIC group. Stay far away. Stay very far away. I quickly wrapped this package up after one horrible viewing and returned it. Learn from my mistake. Please."
1,not good at all,"This dvd is funny. Not funny like entertaining funny. Like it seems like a joke. None of the music in it is by the beatles, probably becuase the beatles didn't authorize their music to be used on the film, or the filmakers didn't have enough money to get the rights to use the music. Also if you watch it you might notice that they never get to go into any of the buildings because they're not authorized to go into any private buildings. I was expecting concert footage and more fun and entertaining stuff but it was mostly press conference footage and a odd man wearing jeans and startrek suit trying to create metaphors and other crazy things about the beatles lives. I bought it and I wish that I hadn't."
1,Wow...,"Well, that was terrible.I'll watch pretty much anything that has to do with the Beatles, and I was psyched when I got this for two dollars in a bargain bin, but now I know why. It's bloody awful.I watched the first ten minutes, then skipped ahead looking for good parts until I ran out of film. The narrator is cheesy and has no idea what hes talking about, and the footage is underwhelming.I never thought Id say this, but that was a waste of two-fifty. And ten minutes."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS They didn't have a NO STARS category,"I would venture to say that Geoffrey Giuliano has made a ""career"" of both beatifying and belittling the Beatles while trying to make himself out to be the foremost expert on the Beatles. All of his material contains much erroneous information which should be a sign to true Beatle fans that if this ""expert"" can't get these simple easily-researched facts straight, how can he keep his other so-called ""facts"" straight? I once corresponded with him and brought this to light and his response hinted that this wasn't important. Let's get this straight...if he has to rely on others to get info on the Fabs, then maybe its because they don't want to tell him anything. He gets a lot of material from previously published interviews and has no real new information. Click on his name ono the right left side of the page and you will see all the garbage media he has put out. WORD OF WARNING. He is the new ALBERT GOLDMAN."
2,Buy it only if you're a Beatles fan,"I have to tell you - if this movie wasn't talking about such great band as The Beatles, I wouldn't say you should buy it. Even so, this item, I think, is only for collectors. I must admit: that's not a good movie, not a bad one, but not something you should keep.Bottom line, I advice you to buy it only if you're a Beatles fan, like myself. If not, good for you to choose something else."
3,"Mostly A Downer, But With Some Redeeming Moments","Geoffrey Guiliano is a very boring person to listen to. He talks with such monotony that I almost fell asleep. There is no music in this DVD at all. But there are some interesting interviews.Frederick Seamen, a friend of John Lennon, was interviewed for this DVD. There are interviews with Alan Williams, Pete Best, as well as with John, Paul and George. There is information here that is not in the Anthology, which I like. More importantly, there is an interview with the Maharishi, which is something I haven't seen in any other documentaries.Interviews aside, there is little value here. Just a boring Beatles ""expert"" talking about the Beatles. A casual fan would not want this. An extremely dedicated fan will be interested in the interviews on this DVD."
1,Don't Bother,"Amazon needs to create a negative star rating for some items.When you have a built-in market that will buy anythingabout a subject like the Beatles it's hard to lose.But this does in a big way.It's sort of like a PowerPoint presentation of random Beatles-related things.A voice over including snippets of what may be the Beatles' voices rambles on asyou see a slide show of such fascinating items as receipts, pages out of booksand magazine photos, taped to a wall. At least they could have varied the fadesfrom one picture to the other, or cropped out the tape holding the picture to a board when they shot it.It's very mechanical and soul-less.Basically this would have to improve to be bad."
1,Does not even deserve one star,"This terrible attempt at a documentary of the Beatles has been released on DVD a couple of times with different covers. Be warned, despite the label claiming that it also includes an added extra ie. a special on Beatlemania, it does not.Worse still, this DVD contains no Beatles music! This should give you an insight to its lack of authorisation. It comes across as a cheap as chips production which is probably why there is no music. The producer simply could not afford it. Don't be fooled by the label stating rare footage. It does not shown anything that has not been seen before. Such utter garbage, and an offence to any Beatles fan. It should be renamed to ""The Beatles Slandered by G. Giuliano"". Avoid at all costs."
2,Amatuer video,"This documentary relies mostly on existing footage woven together in a somewhat coherent manner. The short ""news conference"" with Pete Best is probably the highlight. Relatively interesting to watch but nothing to get overly excited about. The Anthology series may be overkill for a casual fan-but this dvd is too brief and generic!"
4,For display only!,"I have this doll for display purposes, and she's very pretty on a shelf. The only problem is that she isn't very poseable. You turn one arm and her leg moves, but you can't actually get her into any accurate skating poses. This doll is better for a collector than for a kid to play with. Any figure skater will no doubt become frusterated by her innability to bend like Sasha Cohen."
4,Intelligent - not quite le Carré - but engaging enough.,"This franchise was never going anywhere as long as Bond was around. It's interesting & certainly different, to watch but far less engaging."
4,The Best Player Ever.,"This is an exceptionally detailed biography. The statistical chart at the back of all the games he played in was a very pleasant surprise. The only things missing was some tactical diagrams and a map of Brazil. Every chapter added colorful insight into his life-Ch's-2,6,8-facts of life, 9-Pele in love and 17. He also gave the reader the fine nuances of the ""beautiful game."" Chapters-1,3-5,10,12,14-1,000 goal,15-16,18,19-20-Cosmos years. I found chapters 7-race relations in Brazil,11-the trainor, and 13-Santos years to be the most interesting. Lastly, I could not agree more with Pele's distaste for defensive Football on 310-11."
3,So what if he can't write that well. He's Pele!,"This isn't a particularly well-written book, but it's the only place you can go to get Pele talking in depth about himself and his incredible life. That alone makes it worth reading. Where else would you learn about the goalkeeper so embarrassed by Pele's ease of scoring that he (the goalkeeper) ran off the field in embarrassment in front of a crowd of 20,000 people? (Pele apologized to the goalkeeper after the game.) Anyway, the book isn't literature, but it IS history. Check it out."
4,Best Player Ever,Pele is perhaps the best player to have ever played the game and came from nothing - a poor boy from the streets of Brazil. This is a must read for every aspiring soccer player.
1,review of bear-tracker,"This is the first bear tracker I have seen that did not come set up for 12 volt.(And, I was not informed of this by the seller.) I had to buy a converter. For the first week I used it, it never alerted at all. Then after one week it stopped working altogether. I will never buy used electronic items through Amazon again. I tried, unsuccessfully, to get some kind of return label for this item. It is currently sitting in my garage.Robbie, Glendale, Arizona"
4,The Kirkus Review up above is incorrect,"This is book #4, not book #3. The format is the same - an old black cowboy is telling stories to his old dog about Blacks in the early history of the United States - a long-ignored area of history. This series sheds some much-needed light and avoids being preachy.The information is solid and written in an active style - aimed at and just about perfect for 6-9th grade boys. It is written in a historical fiction style, rather than a biographical style. The average story is about 20 pages long. Each story has a picture.Book #4 features Mountain Men:-'Esteban and the Seven Cities of Gold'-Jean Baptiste Du Sable: Founder of Chicago-Jim Beckwourth: Mountain Man and Indian Chief-George McJunkin: Scholar and Cowboy"
3,La Pasionaria,"They shall not pass is both a sad and informative commentary on the communist propaganda surrounding the Spanish Civil War. What begins as a sometimes touching autobiography soon descends into shameless promotion of the position of the communist party, and vicious slander against the anarchists and POUM. It is interesting if only as a testement to the lengths the communist party was willing to go in attacking their allies, in order to consolidate power in Republican Spain."
3,Not a cd to focus on.,"This cd is good for playing without headphones while you do something else. It's difficult to just listen to front to back all the way through with total focus. All along the watchtower is fairly unrecognizable to me, but most of the cd is very pretty. Common margins is probably the song that's most distinguished from the rest of the cd. Tim Reynolds isn't pulling off any solos and the guitar isn't any more powerful or clear than the piano, it is equal parts piano and guitar and if any instrument is more active during the playing time it's the piano. Not a guitar album. Don't buy this because of DM and TR's Luther college cd, it's really not like it at all. I give it a three because the music is beatiful, but still keep in mind it's strictly improv and no overdubs and touch-ups, and for the most part it's hard to tell certain songs from each other. It's not like a normal studio album at all. Good but not great-not like work with DM and theDMB or even like Tim Reynolds own cds."
2,Not worth the money,"I had purchased one of these bottles a few years back and just loved it. Then one time we left it at a baseball game and I was determined to get the exact same one again, and wouldn't settle for the ""boring"" plain water bottle they sell at any store. But after the first day of taking it on the road I realized that it leaks - and not just a little bit, within about 20 minutes the bottle was almost empty and my car seat completely soaked. It was very disappointing and now I'm buying the good old plain bottles you can get anywhere."
2,Pretty but one of the stones fell out,"These earrings are really pretty, but one of the stones fell out the third time I wore them. I did not wear them for long periods and only wore them when I was sitting. So pretty but poor workmanship."
4,Another great Veggie Tales!,"I am a huge Veggie Tale fan. My 3 year old son loves them, my 7 year old daughter loves them (although she won't admit it) and I love them too! This one is yet another great DVD to add to your collection. The story line is very different from the other ones and is a spoof off of Dr. Suess books. It is a very unique and enjoyable story. The silly song is not my favorite. I wish they had chosen a different style for this song because the words are very fun, the music could be better. That is the only reason this DVD did not get 5 stars from me."
4,Fun Show with a Great Silly Song!,"The Dr. Jiggle and Mr. Sly segment of the show is entertaining and fun. The SUV Silly Song is great and quite funny. I think it's funnier for adults than the kids. The silly song pokes fun at how some SUV owners think. The Snoodles tale is nice, not too many laughs though, a Dr. Seuss narrative in a Max Lucado story. The message is OK, but not as strong as other shows."
3,"Not the best, but pretty good","The first part, about the snoodle, is pretty fun. It's like Dr. Seuss meets ""You are Special""(by Max Lucado). It's a nice story, but not one that really grabs all ages, like other Veggietales do. The silly song, Sports Utility Vehicle, is not as funny as others. I don't like the girl they had in it. The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story is ok, but it's not nearly as funny as other ones. All in all, it's not a bad collection, but definitely not their best."
2,french book,"This book was ok, but the CD's that coame with it were missing. When it said new, that is what I assumed. You are better off purchasing this book from a campus store. For the extra $50.00, because that is how much the CD's cost without the book."
4,Excellent introduction to Robert the Bruce's early years ...,"This is the first book in a trilogy. It portrays an impetuous strong-willed young man who agrees to co-govern Scotland with his personal enemy in an attempt to win its independence from England. The effort soon fails and Bruce steps down, but then he makes a separate move to unite the country under his sole leadership. Amongst much internal fighting, he makes great strides.The book covers Bruce's youth from about age 20 until he begins to call himself king. While I enjoyed it, I liked the second and third books in the trilogy better. They are THE PATH OF THE HERO KING and THE PRICE OF THE KING'S PEACE, respectively."
1,Balanced?,"The subtitle of this book reads ""A Balanced, Comprehensive View of Abortion From Its Historical Context To The Current Debate"". What a bunch of garbage!! I am Pro-Life. I was looking for a book that FAIRLY represented both sides of abortion. This book seemed to represent this, based on the subtitle.This book is actually a very one-sided book. It talks only about repressing women, selfish males, right wing wackos, and the heroism that women have gone through to win their rights.All of this is would be fine...if the book did not represent itself as something else. Please just say that you are Pro-Choice. Don't try to deceive the reader. You do nothing to help your cause by misleading. You only disappoint."
2,this toy is made cheap,I got the dream house for my 5yr old daughter for christmas it is now about 3 months later and there are so many things wrong with it the elevator was hard for her to use to begin with the bathtub keeps coming out the bed has already broke for the price I paid for this toy I expected better quilty I don't thing this house is worth more than $50 and even if I found it some where for $50 I still don't think I would recomend this house.
5,Barbie Dream House Playset,"This is one of the best Barbie houses Mattel has ever created! It has a kind of old fashion class to it. It has an elevator that the dolls can go on. To make it work, you just turn the handel and Barbie can get up to her bedroom. It has a lovely old-fashioned balcony and its got really pretty detailing to it.It is also one of the first houses to have a door bell! It also has a luxurious bath tub so Barbie can bath and relax. It has a toilet, but it doesn't open. It has a very small table and i'm pretty sure it has two chairs. It has a lovely sofa, and at the front near the doorbell, there is also a mailbox so Barbie can step outside and get the morning paper! This is a truley beautiful house that has an old-fashioned French/English class to it. I totally recomend it!"
2,price to high for nothing,"the price for this is rediculous considering you can barely fit anything in it. not much of a dream house with 1 couch ,1crib next to a single bed and a compact rv kitchen . for 10$ you can go on ebay an get an original dream house which is twice the size and get better funiture for an entire family. Not a single mom barbie."
3,Print of Cafe Art Poster,"The print is acceptable, however the tonal definition between very dark brown and black areas in the upper left quadrant is lost."
4,Synopsis and Review,"Brilliant painter Molly Light escapes her silent world by communicating with people through her paintings. Stefanos Metadorakis, offering an opportunity to an artist to travel to Greece and paint scenes of Greece that will be put in all his hotels, offers Molly that job. Although deaf, she adapts to the new environment to follow her dreams, and falls in love with the mysterious stranger.It is a suspenseful novel of new places and danger. The descriptions of Greece were realistic, and you can sense Molly's struggle on how to communicate with Stefanos."
1,George W. Bush: Portrait of a Deceiver,"One of the best examples of hero worshipping going way over the top. The only time Prez AWOL said ""bring them on"" during Nam was to a couple of cold six packs at the frat house in Texas."
2,"This must be some alternate usage of the word ""leader"" that I wasn't previously aware of.","I thumbed through this tripe at an in-law's house. I saw lots of big glossy pictures of our fraudulent, appointed ""president"" and quite a few of his various cronies standing about- but no people I would consider ""leaders"".Still, I rate this book 2 stars because I expect it would be fairly useful as an idiot detector. Morons seem to be drawn to pictures of other morons (particularly successful morons- I imagine it makes them feel better) so lay it out on your coffee table and see who picks it up. If the handler doesn't grimace, laugh, or throw this piece of ham handed propganda on the floor... chances are very good that you've located an idiot."
1,"good idea, but all filler","This book could be the memoirs George W. would have a crack team of political writers put together after his presidency. Not a critical or even neutral review of his first four years in the office, this book fails to make any impact on the reader at all.In this collection of short vingettes, from the President's trip to Ground Zero to a chance meeting in Texas that provides the only surprise in the entire book (you'll see what I mean), the author(s) try, and fail(s) to paint a portrait of a good old-fashioned, true-to-his-values president who stands up to the Enemy and fights the Righteous Cause. However, the totality of all these stories is fractured, like the man himself in times of stress.What I wanted from this book was a straight forward, upbeat and selective adoration of This Great Man. But after the last page, this book is just a bunch of cheap, cute filler."
1,Portrait of a what?,"With a Presidency about as leaky as a New Orleans levee and a credible as an Enron balance sheet we have now a tombe about as accurate as a non existant Iraqi missile. Where does the administration get these allegedly washed up hacks to write such drivel. An hour with this epistle from the asylum was like a week being forced to watch O'Reilly on Fox News. Questionably accurate, always with an apparently cynical vicious slant, and about as entertaining and informative as watching paint dry. If your an insomniac you'll love it because you'll never get to the end of it and it will be the best value cure guarenteed for life!"
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent book. It is a book you don't get tired of. If there was an option of giving it more stars, this book truly deserves it. One of the best in the market, portraying one of America's best and truest leaders."
1,Don't bother,"Google ""miserable failure"" and you'll read everything you need to know about our Fearless Leader."
5,A True Leader,"Many people blame President Bush for ""starting a war based on lies"", being ""incompetent"" or ""getting elected only because of his Dad."" They say President Bush ""stole the 2000 election."" This book proves those critics wrong. It shows a man who had the intelligence and humility to understand the presidency is much larger than the person. Someone who understood such a powerful position requires the need to make hard decisions that affect our daily way of life and our future. Often times, those decisions come up unexpectedly. A man who worked hard to comfort the frightened and grieving. Someone who helped give strength to rescuers searching for victims in a vast jungle of destruction where thousands of people died in just a few hours. This book illustrates how President Bush had to make the difficult decision to send brave young men and women to fight in an unknown, volatile area. It also shows how President Bush never forgot that his greatest support system is his family."
3,Lots of glossy pictures of,"George Bush and occasionaly Laura and very occasionaly the twins and only once in a while members of the hoi poli (us regular folk). All carefully staged for maximum glossy effect. At the end of it however, the impression that is left is of the massive isolation of a poseur."
1,PORTRAIT OF A LIAR!,"The cover of this book is really amusing, considering that we're talking about George W. Bush! I've never seen a president make so many idiotic decisions! I hear his brother Jeb wants to run for president next! All of the Bush's need to be removed from this planet, so that America still has a fighting chance! Does anybody really wonder why we havn't found Bin Laden yet? And you people who support him, are dumber than Bush himself."
1,Portrait of a Loser,I chose to give this one star only because zero stars was not an option. Another piece of propaganda from Bush & Co. Rabid right wing agenda machine. Suitable for lining a bird cage.
5,Let's cut the crappola!,People who hate Bush will hate the book. People who like Bush will like the book. 'Nuff said.
4,I love this President,"And I really loved the book. Being a long time supporter of President I've seen most of these pictures before. I wish there were more pictures that were not published before, and that Ted ""Drunken"" Kennedy wasn't in this book, but if you love President Bush you will truly enjoy it.God Bless!"
1,Propaganda,"The very title of the book says it all. One has only to read ""Bush's Brain"" to realize that Bush-43 is anything but a leader. The man hardly exists at all, but is the figurehead for the shadowy cabal led by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Karl Rove, Grover Norquist, and Richard Mellon Scaife that sets the course for our country, a republican democracy such few years ago. From the manipulation of the Supreme Court to declare Bush President in 2000 to the exploitation of the attack on the World Trade Center, these greedy, power-hungry men have taken the first steps toward an American empire. Bush is likely to be given credit, but the leadership comes from behind the scenes."
1,The Portrait of a Idiot.,"Anybody in your right mind supports this horrible president should be ashamed, This book is horrible, everything this president has been telling you is a lie, He is horrible, he doesn't care about black people, He doesn't care about the poor, all he cares about is the rich and other ignorance.It makes me sad that how american has become, this president is worse than reagan, nixon and his own father put together, in fact he's worse than Hoover.This book deserves to be the bottom of the barrel, in fact this book doesn't deserve to be mention in the same sentence as the barrel."
1,Winner of Errors Per Page Award!,"And I don't mean typos! This author has no clue about even the most basic concepts of electricity. I've seen hundeds of electicity books over the past three decades, but none include so many false concepts as Fowler's book. He confuses mass with weight, potential with potential energy, potential with force, etc. He includes that big lie that voltage makes current flow (No! Electric force makes charges flow from one voltage level to another.) If you want to be a massively ignorant electrician, this is the book for you. If you want to learn basic electrical concepts, get ANY other book. Better yet, try Thomas Floyd's books-he only makes a couple mistakes in his book. However, if you are up to snuff with your calculus, get a college introductory physics text with several chapters on electricity and avoid all the garbage taught to electrical field workers for the past century..."
1,Horrible Stay Clear,"This book is written for someone with a 6th grade education and no more. It talks about magamps for pete's sake. It dosen't even broach the subject of transistors. NO TRANSISTOR THEORY!! What in sakes is electronics if not transistors! The stupid objectives at the beginning of each chapter, and the even worst review problems at the end of each chapter are simply a waste of pages. I am a former nuke electrician from the navy and a current IC Fabrication Technician in the semiconductor industry. I purchased the book to just stay up on my studies, but this book fell way short. My fiancee's daughter has learned almost everything that is covered in this book, and she is only in the 7th grade. Be forewarned, a bad book indeed."
5,Unique View of Japan,"Magatama Doodle is an intriguing memoir by a young Dutchman who settles into the banking business in Japan following its surrender after WW II. The reader enters an exotic yet emerging modern world, reflecting the author's growing love of the country tempered by the developing knowledge of cultural contradictions including the stifling of individuality. Brinckmann's vivid descriptions reflect his extensive knowledge of history and a remarkable memory for details conveyed with wry and whimsical humor. A sense of time and place is brilliantly presented through the author's creative and poetic skills no doubt enhanced through his intimate knowledge of the country after acquiring a beautiful and artistic Japanese wife. This reader was enchanted and enlightened and eagerly awaits another volume."
3,OK Duo,"This disc holds two movies in the Howling series that I would rate as OK werewolf flicks. Howling V is set in a Romanian castle with the guests trying to figure out who the werewolf is and Howling VI features a werewolf tracking down the ringleader of a travelling circus in order to avenge his family's death. I would give each of these movies the same 3-star rating given that they weren't bad.Number V was a bit boring as the suspense would be interrupted by the remaining survivors congregating once again in a room to discuss the next plan of action. It would have been much better if tension was maintained without interruption and needless banter.Number VI did a good job with keeping things interesting and the setting was an unusual one for a werewolf film. However the werewolfry was almost unwerewolf-like in both appearance and actions and this made the movie into something else of it's own as opposed to something in the ""Howling"" genre."
4,Horror Collections,"This brings my libery to date with these dvd's. I haven't watched them yet but will soon and have it as a horror night with my friends starting from 1 to 6. These movies sould not have been as 1 etc, They are too different in storylines with no connections to the previous ones. But too much telling of ones own opinions and somebody elses are different. The movies are watchable there are worse but I wanted to finish my collection and that is the reason I brought them."
3,Howlong 5 & 6,I remember this from the 80's and liked it immensely. The first howling was good except for the end where Dee Wallace Stone turned into a big mouse. This one was just as scary as when I first saw it without being super bloody and gory! Loved my sister trying to figure out who the were wolf was.
2,OK,"I want to start out by saying that I own all of THE HOWLING movies and the first one and the second one are the best out of the entire bunch, but if you are like me and buy horror movies to add to a collection go ahead and pick them all up like I did. They are worth the watch on a lazy night when you have nothing better to do. These two movies are decent, they aren't really scary and don't really have anything to do with the original concept but again they are good to watch on a night you have nothing better to do."
1,Fire Hazard,"I got one of these for Christmas and it has sat in my closet ever since. The problem is that the light doesn't fit snuggly into the base and as a result, this won't shut off. Since there is no on/off switch, I can't just shut it off and have to pull the plug every time I want to shut it off. A zippo lighter would be more convenient for lighting up my workspace!!"
2,"Kills germs, smells strong",I bought this soap because I have 2 wrestling boys and skin diseases are easily passed. I think it prevents germs but it smells very antiseptic and medicine like so getting them to use it is a match in itself!
2,Ok Vocal Chill,"I'm a huge sounds from the ground fan. I own most of their stuff, including natural selection. I'm NOT a huge fan of this album! For me, sounds from the ground is about downtempo electronic chill. The occasional and rare vocal track is a nice change of pace for these guys. But that's just it, occasional and rare is the key to my enjoyment. Most of natural selection is vocal based, not my cup of tea. Those that enjoy vocal chillout, this might be the album for you. But if you think that the words get in the way of blissful relaxation, stick with the other albums by SFTG."
2,A waste of my time,"I have to say that the title of the book really intrigued me and I am the type of person who will browse different types of books and pick one based on what is on the back cover. However, this sad tale of love really struck my brain a couple of times and I was almost at the point of putting it down a couple of times because I felt sick to my stomach. I am still in the process of reading it but am really trying to just finish it. I would like to know what happens in the end and I only have 40 pages to go. Maybe the ending will make a difference in how I feel about this book. And I also think that the footnotes are a pointless waste of space. Evidently, this was just not my type of book and I really couldn't identify with any of the characters because they all seemed to be outlandish and overexaggerated. Just my opinion, as I am entitled to it...."
1,Can't finish this book,"I don't see what so many saw in this book....maybe I just didn't get it. I was looking for more humor, and he was just depressing and weird. Stopped at page 100 and could not go anymore."
1,A disappointing novel from a great writer,"This book is so poorly written it was hard for me to get through it. Tim O'Brien is such a good writer, and I have enjoyed so many of his book s that I kept going and was really disappointed in the slap-dash feel of the story, the weird attitude of the hero. The best part of this book is the (too brief) flashback to Vietnam where you really feel O'Brien's power to reach through the page and grab you. But ultimately, this is a really bad read."
4,Of course he's obnoxious. That's the whole point.,"Let me explain something to the folks who disparage Tomcat in Love because the narrator is a self-centered, obnoxious prig: This is a novel about a guy who is a self-centered, obnoxious prig out for revenge on his ex-wife and her lover. It is a hilarious portrait of a total jerk. I loved it.Then again, I have to admit to being an Updike fan. I even like Philip Roth! And, OK, maybe I'm old--but more of a dog than a cat. I haven't read John Cheever, but if he deserves as much scorn as O'Brien, Roth, and Updike, I'll have to check him out."
2,"I love Tim O'Brien, but...",This was a really difficult book to read. The narrator is so dispicable and confused in his own mind that it's hard to wade through the book. The main character has few if any redeeming characteristics and that makes this just painful to read.
2,Hope this book means Tim is feeling a little better ...,"When I read a profile of the tortured Tim O'Brien in the Washington Post a couple years ago, after the publication of In the Lake of the Woods, I got the distinct impression that he was teetering on the verge of shuffling off this mortal coil. I am so glad that he chose to write another book instead.Tomcat in Love is vastly more light-hearted than O'Brien's previous work and good for him. Good to see a fine writer testing the waters and enjoying success as he does so.I just wish I'd found Tomcat funnier. I know other people will. Cheever and Updike fans, and those old cats who always liked Philip Roth, may just have found another literary pal in the kinder, gentler O'Brien. Not so much, me.Because O'Brien is a masterful storyteller with a vivid sense of place, I'll read his next novel also, but the work I'll keep recommending is The Things They Carried, one of the best short story collections I've ever read."
3,fairly funny,"It was fairly funny but about 3/4 thru the humor was poor and much was based on women, even girl children."
2,I love Tim O'Brien but...,"I hated this book. Hated may not be a strong enough word. And I have really enjoyed everything else by Tim O'Brien. None of his characters are flawless people, but I found the main character of this book so distasteful that I couldn't get beyond that. There has to be someone in a book that you can sympathize with and this book just did not provide that. I barely made my way through it."
3,Huh?,"I have just finished this book and kinda wondered what the point is. Sure it has some great characters , kooky situations and Mr O' Brien's mastery of the English language. But what does it make me feel? Nothing really. I loved Going After Cacciato and The Things They Carried but this book just sits kinda uneasy in my heart!"
1,Bad,"I wanted to like this book, really, but after 70 pages or so, I realized life is too short to waste on crap like this. Where to start? The lead character speaks like someone in a Stephen King novel. For instance, who have you ever met someone in real life who introduces themself with their full name, including middle name? Now, that wouldn't be so bad if, like King, it had a good plot. But I didn't believe this one for a microsecond. The whole family watched from a window as the teen couple kissed? The girl in the lingerie store cheerfully tried on clothes for the lead character? Come on. When the protagonist showed up in the yard of his family's old house and started weeping, I made a vow to myself: If he wound up bedding the woman who came outside to chase him away, I was outta there. I'm glad I followed that vow."
4,Journey to the center of delusion...,"An amazing accomplishment. Tim O'Brien took me inside the mind of an arrogant, misogynistic, over-inflated windbag, a man impossible to like...and I ended up feeling sympathy for him. He deserves every comeuppance, because he's so totally clueless, until the very end. I was getting a bit tired of the plot, and looking forward to the end of the book, just to be done. But the surprising last chapter was the best of all."
2,Our book club found this to be a big disappointment.,"Our book club of 6 dynamic professional women found this book to be pathetic, except for Christy who liked the humor, which eluded the rest of us. We thought Thomas was an undeveloped creep, an offensive womanizer. If Thomas was the anti-Christ, doubting character, then Lorna Sue could have been the redeemer except she ended up as evil as he was. Where is the redeeming value of these people? Not to mention where is the compassion? Our intention is to read meaningful literature, and we thought this was close to a waste of time, but for the lively discussion. We look forward to next month with Barbara Kingsolver. And our Long Beach, CA public library will have 4 donated copies of Tomcat. Are they lucky? We doubt it."
3,Getting even is better than getting mad when you wife leaves,"""Tom Cat in Love"" is a story about a middle aged Professor of Linguistics in Minnesota and his love/hate relationship with his childhood sweetheart who leaves him for a Tampa businessman. He fancies himself ""irresistible"" to women and his best writing is his descriptions of Vietnam and his interreactions with the troops there. The book through flashbacks attempts to explain his bitter-sweet relationship with his childhood sweetheart. He really doesn't seem to like women all that well and the plot weaves on from one difficult to believe scenario to another. ...I became bored with the plotting and after one third of the way began reading backward and found it more satisfying."
1,Does anyone remember Nabokov?,"Because he wrote this character well. Chippering makes you want to hurl, not laugh. I don't know what people liked about this insufferable book. O'Brien was very highly recommended to me, and I intend on reading something else of his on the strength of these recommendations, but Tomcat in Love was a horrible book. Do yourself a favor and read Lolita instead. Humbert is funny and disgusting, Chippering is just disgusting. And what a bore."
1,"Hated it, couldn't finish it",This book is sophomoric. I could not even finish it...in fact I had to throw it in the trash because I would have been too embarrassed to pass it on to my friends.
1,A notch below dissapointing,"This was a huge dissapointment to me... not only not funny, but not even interesting! Obrien's a fine writer... what happened here??"
1,Way Overrated. I Couldn't Finish It.,"Beware whenever a review says ""run do not walk to your nearest bookstore; it's that good"". I fell for that plug, and purchased this book, with high expectations, but was disappointed. It's interesting and funny in places, but the way it was written, in first person, using flashbacks throughout, created little suspense and made it difficult to follow. There was way too much introspection and reflection by the lead character, and this made for laborious reading at times. Many of the supporting characters seemed like very interesting people but the reader never got a chance to know them. I gave up and stopped reading after the third chapter. I did skim the rest to see if there was anything worth reading on for but I didn't find anything."
3,"Crazy at first sight, sweet in the end","This book is a easy read at the beginning. It starts with some childhood memory like a lot of other books. Then it became hard to read all that Tommy's craziness and obsessive behaviour. At last, alas, it ended with common sense and some bitter sweet twist.You need to be patient to read through all those pages, and in many ways, all those loose ends."
4,Lighten up-You'll laugh!,"If you are introduced to Mr. Chittering thinking you know him by way of his creator, you'll miss one of the true joys of reading-namely meeting quirky characters living quirky lives. Tom's mind thread is whacked (or is it?) Expecting to be reintroduced to a familiar character will guarantee you miss a seat on the bus. Mr. O'Brien touched our hearts in his previous works. It's a precious thing to know his heart is a bit lighter...and we all get to smile. Enjoy."
5,Works like a champ,I wanted a spare battery for my Nikon D80 and this brand was recommended by a pro photographer on my message board. The price was right so I decided to give it a try. Works great and holds the charge just the the Nikon brand. I'd buy again without hesitation!
3,Didn't expect to see animal lovin',"Although based upon Thoth, the colors aren't as vibrant and don't jump off the cards like the original deck. Plus contains some bestiality (bull doing a woman from behind) and other unusual sex scenes. I really wanted to like this deck, but I don't use it often. Sorry, stick with Thoth."
2,Deserves a different title,"I would have called this book "" Unpublished Photographs of the Eastern Front form the Soviet Propaganda Machine "". The vast majority of the pictures are from the Soviet view, with hardly any photos of Wehrmacht troops. I ordered this hoping to have more pictures of German equipment as I am an avid modeller. I was disappointed to see instead pictures of smiling partisans, smiling Russian soldiers, staged "" attacks "", etc. If you want pictures of the Soviet side, then get this book, although it has few pictures of equipment for those so interested."
2,Tons of fortgetable pictures,"This book DOES have tons of pictures of the Eastern Front. But the majority of them are typical pictures of non-combat operations. The term ""the unpublished photographs"" leads one to believe this collection of photos is special or rare. Well I'm here to say that they my be 'rare' but they are definately unspecial. Very boring shots of men standing here or there, shots of equipment and solders marching across landscape. But zero pictures of the combat horrors in which the eastern front well known for. If you want endless undescript photos of Russians, buy this book. If you want action photos of quality, search elsewhere."
5,Good Book,comes more from the russian point of view which you don't see much. alot photos i've seen for the very first time.
3,Weird...,"Fight, Team, Fight! wasn't that great. It was weird, and a little boring. When you find out who the person is, you are like, ""Whoa!"" but other than that, the book was pretty dull. I do recommend it though, because all of the Seniors books are pretty good. This one wasn't great, but good."
4,A Good Book in the Senior Series,"I read the Senior Series when it first came out (I think I was in junior high at the time, and now just graduated from High School) and the books still stick in my head. I remember this one because I had always been of Stine's Cheerleader books, and this one actually felt somewhat like those books. It had the great suspense, and gore of the first two books, and had a very likeable cast. The book is pretty darn violent, but nothing worse than what Stine normally write. I would read the series in order though, just because of the fact that you need to pay attention to who dies in what book."
5,The Best Fear Street Seniors book so far...,"I dont know what some past reviews said about this book being boring...it was the best seniors book till now...I didnt really enjoy the others, but this had a style like the older Fear Street books I always loved...the first few books of the series were not so great and could have been so much better...but this one lived up to its reputation...the killer was quite possibly the most sinister from any Stine book and the most evil...this book was intense and enjoyable and there was nothing boring about it...hope the books that follow are just as good..."
5,Very Surprising!!,This was a good story with a shocking finish. You won't believe the culprit! I also think that Phoebe is a very likeable character. You sort of feel sorry for her throughout the whole thing. I definitely recommend this book. GO BUY IT!!
2,Disappointing Second Half,"... The first half of the story was rich with descriptions of the party and the battle, and took 31 pages to deliver. But I was so disappointed with the cursory and quick ending of the story - Maria's adventure in the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy - which only merited 16 pages. It seemed imbalanced. ..."
1,Totally Misleading Title,"As the other reviewer has noted , this is the pilot episode only. Great show,but buy the season 1&2 releases.How they can say ""The Complete Works"" and get away with it is beyond me."
2,This is not the complete series . . .,"Advertised as The Complete Works, this is actually a pilot for the Crime Story series that followed. While the original pilot was good in its own right, this particular show did not hit its stride until the second season, when the story moved from Chicago to Las Vegas.The video itself is a ""region one"" DVD, which essentially means it is made for sale and play in the United States and Canada. However, the DVD is an import of dubious quality."
2,Not Bad but Not Great either,"This book is just there. Yes, it's different in the fact it's written in a type of prose-like style that gives the reader the impression they are listening to a TaleTeller speak around a firepit at night. It's advertised as a story where a woman warrior strides about Ancient Japan wielding a magic sword and fighting demons. Um..no. That's not what it's about. It's a mish mash of Japanese Folklore that plods along with some of the characters finding closure but the main character not. It just ends, and not in a satisfying way. I wouldn't spend the cash, but it's worth checking out of your local library for a quick read. Not anywhere worthy of the praise given it by the other reviewers, in my opinion of course."
5,I love this book,"I bought it when it first came out in 1972, because I thought it had a cool cover. I was right out of high school and scandalized at the way he wrote: little if any dialogue, strange passages that just seemed to go around and around. It was my first inkling that literature could color outside the lines. I still have my original copy on the shelf behind my desk. It is different in a way that suggested to me that the author was writing in the grip of some fierce desire to please himself and look: all these years later, it's still in print. I just bought a copy for my son who is about the same age I was when I read it. I won't make promises that you'll love this thing, but it's an hypnotic trip. I give it five stars for the journey that it put me on."
5,Edge of your seat!,"Great book! The main character, Mark Stevenson, is sent on a macarbe scavenger hunt around the country looking for ""The Family Man,"" a serial killer that was never apprehended. I listened to this one on tape, and it kept me hooked from the beginning. It was VERY suspenseful. The ending was a twist I didn't see coming...I wished the book kept going after I read the last page!"
2,Totally Boring,"Picked this up in a used book store in desperation as I had run out of reading material. I won't make the mistake of picking up Tom Savage again. Aside from the plot weakness, the character development was really disappointing with the exception of FBI man O'Hara. Perhaps if the book had been written with him as the central character, it would have been more readable. The ""hero"" Mark, and I use that term loosely, was pitiful and hard to root for from the very beginning, and his girlfriend, Tracy, a paperdoll. It was an extremely quick read which is probably a plus since I was glad when it was over."
3,OK Read,I really like Tom Savage but this one was not his best. Read it if you are a fan but it could have been better.
2,Stupid ending!!,This book started out great but I was very disappointed by the bizarre ending. I felt let-down. I can't say very much more without giving the ending away. Get this one at the library so you will not have wasted any money on it!
4,Had me fooled...,"My cousin bought this book for me as a Christmas gift and what a nice surprise it was! I never read Tom Savage before, but I will be sure to catch up with his previous novels. I thought I had the ""Family Man"" completely figured out. Of course, I was wrong. WAY wrong! You can distinguish between a good and bad thriller based on if you have figured out the killer. Therefore, this was an amusing read. I would have given it 5 stars, however parts were somewhat redundant, and the ending, although surprising and satisfying, was a bit convoluted. Anyhow, ""Scavenger"" is a good read under a warm blanket."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Having read both ""Valentine"" and ""Precipice,"" which were both terrific edge-of-your-seat thrillers, I expected the same quality and suspense in ""Scavenger."" Save your money, this book is nothing like Savage's other books and not worth the time reading. The plot started with all the right ingredients and ""The Family Man"" was an intresting concept. However, there were too many victims, too many villains, and the ending was just too far-fetched. By the second half of the book, keeping track of all the characters was more trouble than the book was worth, the interest level dropped significantly and one was left with the feeling, ""I hope the author never writes a sequel"""
1,Contrived.,"""Scavenger"" contains 1-dimensional characters who fail to touch any chord of recognition. The prose is often forced, the descriptions unappealing. The ending is so contrived that I was actually angry at myself for finishing the book."
1,Rotten Tomatoes Only Get Worse the Longer You Keep Them,"I tend to treat a book like an investment-- the more pages I read, the more determined I am to reach the payoff the end. But sometimes-- and Scavenger is one of them-- it pays to dump a loser and try something new. Scavenger is easy reading and the beginning of the book shows some promise. However, soon the plot seems rather flawed and the character's motivations appear contrived-- a flimsy excuse for the character to continue his hunt. The plot only gets more contrived and ridiculous; and I, the reader, felt more and more like a fool for not having the strenght to ditch the disaster. To redeem myself, I threw the book out after I read it and wrote this review. Don't say you weren't warned."
5,Incredible ending !,"This was my first Savage novel, but it will not be my last. Incredible ending! I thought I had the plot figured out, and I'm usually good at correctly guessing the ""killer"", but I was way off base on this one. That is how I judge whether a thriller or mystery is good or not. If I can figure out the plot too soon, well even if it is a good novel, I'm usually disappointed. Don't be fooled by the negative comments, you will be surprised with the ending. Mr. Savage has a new fan! Beware of the ""Family Man"""
2,disappointing ending,"This was an interesting novel initially. Although it was rather graphic and somewhat far-fetched, the pace was fast and the chapters were short enough to keep the plot moving. However I had a real problem with the ending. The suspense kept me involved until the last couple of chapters when the ""secret"" is revealed. What a miserable way to end the story, cheap and unsatisfying. I felt annoyed that I had read this book and paid good money for it. This was my first Tom Savage novel and my last."
1,I can't believe I bought this...,"Wow, Usually I love a serial killer novel, but this book just made me want to fall asleep. I couldnt even finish it (Something that hardly ever happens!) I found myself just waiting for the antagonist to kill off the protagonist just to get the book over with. By the time I finally gave up on it the only thing I kept thinking with the turning of each predictable page was ""Who Cares!"". The positive reviews by James Patterson and Michael Connelly make me suspicious about any other reviews by these two fine authors."
2,No Surprise,"Scavenger held my interest for half the book. When I figured it out,(which I wasn't trying to do) I thought, ""Oh, it can't be that."" But, it was. I thought it well written, but it didn't surprise me, but I think I may have read too many thrillers."
2,"SO UNBELIEVABELY BIZZARE, I DIDN'T LIKE IT!","I have read all of Tom Savage's novels except for Precipice and I don't think I'll read that one. I read ""Valentine"" and I thought it was quite good. In ""The Inheritance"" I just couldn't get past page 70. That book was very dull. In ""Scavenger,"" the book's ending is just so amazingly and incredibly weird! I can't talk much about it because I would be giving away too much. The whole thing is about a crazy man making this author play a game and going on a Scavenger Hunt to find the truth about a murderer. The ending is just so bizarre! I did not like the way it turned out at all. Sorry, Mr. Savage, but I think I'll pass on your next novel."
1,A Waste Of The Author's Talent,"The basic plot of this book - that a serial killer will send someone on a scavenger hunt before killing him is so ludicrous that the novel has two strikes on it before you start. Then - chapter after chapter (and city after city) the tale becomes so trite and repetitious that it does the almost-impossible; it makes a book about a serial killer BORING. What is missing from most of books of this genre - and certainly from this one - is WHY SHOULD WE, THE READERS, CARE about the characters? The answer is WE DON'T! Go buy a Dick Francis novel (anyone of them) and you'll get a better, less gory, less sensational (but much more intelligent and entertaining) read."
1,Literary falsehoods.,"Tom Savage has a very bad habit. He tends to lie to his readers. Much like Valentine, this book has an interesting premise, but a killer who is much too obviously the culprit. The only way Tom Savage is able to hide the killer's identity from the reader is to lie. He has the killer act, speak, and think in the way an innocent person would, even when they are alone with their thoughts, which defies plasusibility.The real problem with the 'twist ending' is that it removes any motivation that the main character might have had for their actions - Savage seems to know this, when he tries to off-handedly throw in a theory of the crime in the epilogue.The premise really did have promise, but unmotivated characters, a terrible ending, and plot points that don't hold up to the slightest bit of common sense make this book another disappointment."
3,Stupid Ending is Right!!,"I usually don't go for the Mystery section, but I picked this one up on a whim. The storyline was OK; the cat-and-mouse game was pretty good once it picked up; but the ending was just stupid!! Again, without giving too much away - I don't know if the author planned this ending from the start, or he finished the game, and didn't know what to do next, so made up the only thing he could think of (Stephen King is guilty of this too I think in several of his otherwise great novels).But what a disappointment.It was worth reading once, I guess."
4,"Great for party artists and hobbyists, but pack extra batteries.","I'm a henna artist, and got a few of these for party gigs where you're not always guaranteed a good light source. Let me tell you, they work great! They're small, lightweight, and easy to pack in my on-the-go henna kit. The light is also easily adjusted to point where you need it to. My boyfriend stole one of mine for installing hardware in his computer. I would suggest having extra batteries handy if you use it regularly on gigs, because my batteries didn't last quite as long as I was hoping (though they did last through multiple gigs)."
4,low budget high technology jvc home theatre,"Had a limited budget. Rolling Stone magazine, gave this home theatre in a box; a solid review. A low cost system with HDMI. 1000 watts, 5 disc cd/dvd player and SMALL. Sounds great and I've ran it HARD. MOVIES, SPORTS and MUSIC. CLEAR cranked all the way up, and its LOUD.Could use some more input channels, but there are ways around that and it wasnt hard. Highly recommend! I scored it for 250 DELIVERED!!!"
4,Great product .. Great sound for the price,"I installed this product in my bedroom, and it sounds great. I'm not sure how it would sound in a larger room, but I suspect it would sound good because I don't even raise the volume above the half way point.I would have given it a 5 if the rear speaker wires were longer, or if the wires were't wired directly into the speaker. Also, the remote control is a little difficult to figure out without the manual, and it is very symmetrical, which makes it difficult to find the right buttons in the dark.Despite these shortcomings, it's a great system. I would definitely recommend it."
2,Does not play an ipod,"What is the use of a USB port if it won't play the Ipod. Also, the speaker wires aren't long enough."
3,Not Loud Enough !,"This systems seams to do the job well, but i wouldn't recommend it for bigger rooms. It's just not loud enough. My TV speakers are louder. Other than that i would recomended it if you have >47"" TV."
1,"Useless, cheap, defective, junk","The float is mounted crooked and sticks in it's travel toward the top. I tried knocking it loose several times with the palm of my hand but the angle is such that it is unusable, ie. it needs to ""float"" freely. Cheaply made junk, very disappointing. I'll look for a different/better brand. Was going to make a video review but forgot to bring it home from work this weekend. Just wanted to go ahead and make this comment before anyone else wasted their money on this junk."
3,Good for getting a rough reading,"[edited] Upgrading from 2 to 3 stars.Overall, this tool will do a good job of letting you know whether any of your cells are bad. If that's all you need to know, then it's is a fine product.I found, however, that the readings are not consistent enough to provide accurate measurements. Test after test usually ranges plus or minus a graduation (about .025 each).Previously, I had a complaint that it was difficult to tell if the proper amount of fluid was being used because the meniscus (curvature of the liquid) didn't match with the fill-to line, but was informed that standard practice is to read at the bottom of the meniscus. I may have known that at some point, but certainly forgot about it. So, it turns out I've been using a number of devices incorrectly, but unfortunately with this one the readings are still inconsistent. Regardless, I've found this item to be useful enough that I'll give it a star boost."
5,Works well and great tool for the price,"I'd been having issues with my car batteries and use a trickle charger to recharge them. Rather than taking to Autozone to find out if it's bad I've used this handy and low tech tool to check the acidity of the fluid and thus far it has worked well and been confirmed when I've needed to exchange my battery for a new one. Any product you can purchase that doesn't need electricity to work is a good thing. Plus, no maintenance and it's a no brainer to use."
4,"Simple , works as expected",Needed a hydrometer for golf cart batteries and this works as expected. Simple and inexpensive. I have used hydrometers before but it would have been nice if more thorough instructions were included.
4,Seems to Be OK,"I have used this product a few times since purchasing it, and it seems to work OK. However, I have no way to verify accuracy."
4,Works like it should,Put it to work as soon as I got. Appears to give a accurate reading of the battery cell condition. I would reccomended this tool to anyone.
5,Great product,"Works as advertised, what else can I say to take up enough words that the site will take my review"
3,"Plain English, finally","I work at a job now that lets me use plain English in my writing. It's about time! This book covers the topic relatively well, since the concept is still new and will take awhile to spread. There are still a lot of writers who won't follow the plain English trend. I keep the book on my shelf at work hoping that people will see it and inquire."
4,The Glucosamine Advantage,Love this product simply for the joint healing agent. I can really work it at the gym and not feel sore the next day with this product!
1,Self Promotion Leavened with Cheap Sentimentality,"So Al Gore's national campaign manager has finally gotten around to scribbling down her inspiring blahblahblahblah biography and her pithy blahblahblah political observations. I guess you could call it ""one heck of a recipe!"" So: what exactly should we learn from the campaign manager for an incumbent Vice-President for one of the most popular administrations in decades who manages to lose to a a guy who obviously is a moron? Can Donna teach us how you can lose an election even when you start off with all the advantages?? Can she teach us how to write off Ohio when it's still competitive, and how to scale back media spending in Florida for the last weeks of the campaign? Somehow I have a feeling that this book is not going to age well. I suggest you wait until it's remaindered by that book store at the outlet stores mall where they sell discount Bibles and last year's Tom Clancy novels."
4,Real People,"I had the chance to meet Ms. Brazile at a college graduation. She was the commencement speaker and I found her surprisingly down to earth and a good natured. The book adds to my opinion of her. As a woman in a man's world, she handled herself in good fashion.Pick it up and enjoy!"
5,practical and inspiring,"katherine stone's book on loft design is one of my favorites. if you have an open loft type space and need help laying it out - this book is both extremely practical and as well as inspiring. katherine walks you through every choice you will face and gives you the pros and cons of each decision. this book is very oriented towards creating your own dream floor plan and to that end she gives you starting measurements for literally every possible room, appliance, closet etc. the book is very well organized and the pictures are great. i showed this book to my architect and he bought himself a copy. not a bad recommendation!"
2,Does NOT have the same loft as real down!,"This ""comforter"" is a disappointment. It's more of a blanket. It's very thin and does NOT have the same loft and warmth as real down, as stated in the product description. I was expecting two fluffy and cozy, twin size comforters for my children, ages 3 and 5. The the soft, cotton cover is well-made with satin piping around the edges. The manufacturer put money into the cover, but skimped on the filling. When the comforter is held up to the light, there are many places where the light shines through the filling. I would have returned the two comforters, but decided against it, since I'd have to pay return shipping for two boxes. (They were shipped separately.) I put the comforters in ""Pinzon 100% Cotton Solid Flannel Twin Duvets"" (also ordered from Amazon) and use them as ""blankets"" for the kids. They ended up being very expensive blankets! I rated two stars, rather than one, because of the quality cover."
5,Down alternative comforter,I bought this last year and I have been very pleased with it. it is very soft and warm I use it as a top cover on a flannel top sheet in the winter.It is a nice size covers my queen bed..It is a good alternative to down if you are allergic to feathers like I am.The only bad thing about this comforter is it needs to be dry cleaned but then all comforters needs to be dry cleaned because they do not fit in an average size washer very well. I would recommend this highly
2,neither dance nor workout,"I've been doing dance workouts for years. I'm 65 and fairly fit for my age, and I was bored to tears with this DVD. It's extremely repetitious and not strenuous at all. I returned it immediately."
5,"AN INVALUABLE, INFORMATIVE, FUNNY BOOK","GETTING THE MOST FROM YOUR YELLOW PAGES ADVERTISING is in many ways unique. It's packed full of information, yet it's also humorous, in a couple of places it's laugh out loud funny. And it taught me a lot about small business marketing and about yellow page advertising in particular."
5,I TELL EVERY SMALL BUSINESS PERSON I KNOW ABOUT THIS BOOK.,Yellow page advertising costs so much and is potentially so valuable (and potentially also a waste of money) that no one can afford not to practically memorize this book. I've been through it twice already!
5,EVEN BETTER THAN THE HYPE!,"I bought this book because I read a review that claimed it would make my advertising work far better than it had been working. I was skeptical, but since I was paying $85 a month for phone book advertising and the book only cost $20, I decided to give it a chance.Our phone book came out the month before last, and using what I learned in this book, I'm getting so many more calls that I've already earned more than the cost of the whole year's yellow pages advertising, and I've made a fine profit.I'm going to re-read the book every year before I do my yellow pages."
5,Finally!,I never thought that this Luis Valdez work would ever be released on DVD. The picture and sound are wonderful. Start a Christmas time tradition. Buy this dvd and share it with your family!
1,Wanted to show it to my students but...,"I saw this movie years ago. At the time it was funny and worth watching. Now it just seems boring. After 30 minutes, I had to force myself to watch it to the end. The idea of it is great -- a dying cultural activity captured on film -- but not worth showing to students."
5,I loved it!,This simple DVD brought back many memories of his childhood to my sister. It is a very nice movie if you like to see her family and have memories of your childhood. It is in excellent condition.
5,Skecher's Tinseltown,Extremely comfortable and light shoes. I work on my feet for 8-10 hours per day and have had significantly fewer knee and shin problems when I wear them!
2,"Works, but costs too much for flimsy plastic.","This thing does work as advertised, but I guess I expected something more substantial. The only value in this thing is the hinged door that you can press with your foot. If you could dig a hole in the ground and put a door on it, you have everything this thing offers. I mean come on, $35 for some thin plastic and some screws. Valuewise this thing should go for around $10, and then I might buy one again."
1,Waaaay overpriced,"Great idea to break down dog waste instead of throwing it away, but there's no way this product should cost more than $5 - it's just five pieces of flimsy plastic with a hinge and digestive enzymes. You could make your own for much cheaper, considering that it's just a hole in the ground with a lid over it.Keeping the enzymes active is a pain too - you have to keep the turd soup at the bottom of the hole wet and active, which means adding poop and water every day. Not very convenient if you only clean up after your dog a few times a week. I definitely wouldn't buy this again."
2,disappointing results,"Product quality ok, install ok with proper drain pipe I provided, however, after using with chemical provided and proper drainage and water, devise performed terrible according to advertisement expectations. I would not recommend this product. I would rather dig a hole and use ridx and dispose of excrement on my own."
2,Mosquitoes!,"Just started a month ago, and got a swarm of mosquitoes today! Three mosquito fish were added to give biological control a chance. Please share if anyone has success with other methods. I'd only use chemicals as a last resort."
4,Not as bad as they say,"I didn't buy one on-line from Amazon, but I bought it from my Napa automotive store. I too use it for parasitic electric draws. It's nice to quickly zero the meter for an accurate current draw. The large clamp is nice as well given numerous leads off batteries. I like to be able to hang it off some wires using the clamp while I read the voltage with the test leads. All and all not a bad meter."
5,INVISIBLE IS VISIONARY,"FOR WOMEN OVER 50 (AND ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT WOMEN), THIS IS A MUST READ. THESE WOMEN SHOW THE WAY WE CAN OVERCOME OBSTACLES AND MAKE ENRICHED FUTURES FOR OURSELVES. HOORAY FOR THESE YOUNG-MINDED, WISE AND FASCINATING WOMEN!"
3,"""Invisible No More"" could have stayed invisible...","I heard one of the authors interviewed on a Sunday evening radio program. It was a good and interesting interview. I found the book to be neither. I'm a 59 yo man who bought it for a woman friend. The interesting topics in the interview (how women are perceived by others at certain ages, effects of changing/not changing hair color, etc.) were not featured in the book, which struck me as 3 not-very-interesting-but-overly-self-absorbed people with not much to say of interest. It had some thoughtful stuff, but not enough to capture my interest. I'm sure there's an audience for this out there, but I'm not in it..."
1,Invisible no more,I wish this book was invisible so I wouldn't have bought it. One prolapse after another is enough for me. BORING!!! And a waste of my money. Actually I wouldn't of given it one star but I couldn't send the review unless I checked one.
3,"Just purchase ""The Herbalist's Way"" instead","If you own or are looking to purchase ""The Herbalist's Way"" by the same authors then this book is as good as redundant. The Herbalist's Way can be considered the new revised addition to ""The Village Herbalist"" & is packed with ""more"" information. The distinct difference I have found (I just received this book after ordering) are the 8 full color photos of people tending & picking herbs (cover & title have been changed).It's still nice to get if you just ""have"" to have it but not really necessary so I am a bit disappointed that this was not mentioned anywhere before I paid money for this book. Still, no complaints on content but 3 stars because there is a better version out there.Well now I know why it's no longer in print lol!!"
1,Nice Look - Poor Functionality,Nice looking bag. Laptop pouch way too small. Will not accommodate basic Dell notebook. I had to return this item.
2,Over Kill.........,Way to much information that I grew exhausted trying to read it. Ordered it and tossed it 2 days upon receipt! Crazy but it just wasn't for me!!
5,A great resource,I have found Pocket Guide to your Heart to be a valuable tool in bringing me to a place of peace and love in my life. It has helped me find that place in me that I always searched for but could never find.Everything in my life is better because of my work with the Pocket Guide to your Heart formulas. I have been able to improve and enhance my relationships with others but especially my relationship with myself.It is a book that can be read over and over with new lessons to be learned with each reading.
3,A Nice Attempt,"Don't let the title of my review mislead you. This is a great reference book to keep on your shelf and look up when you run into a problem. In fact, you'll find many of the same answers in this book if you search for them on Google Groups, not surprising since Swinford is a regular there. What lets the book down is that it provides a scant three pages on problems arising from using PowerPoint with other applications like Word, PDF and Flash. And in my years of using PowerPoint in a real world situation, these annoyances come up more than anything else. I thought I'll be able to work around these issues when I bought this book, but was disappointed. However, maybe your requirements are different, so to be fair enough, this is just my opinion. Overall, this boom is a nice attempt."
2,Deceptive,"If you think you can learn Statistics intuitively and without mathematics or in otherwords the easy way, I have an intuitive Brain Surgery book for sale."
4,Cheap and useful!,"This book is useful for some basic statistics, but for more complex statistics not so much. But, I guess if you do not know anything about statistics it will be very helpful. It has lots of relevant examples to biological experiments, which makes much easier for someone with biology/medical background and little knowledge in statistics."
5,Great Songwriting for Times Like These,"Dave Morrison is a songwriter's songwriter, but that's nothing new. I've been hearing that from songwriters in the Los Angeles area for many years now who were also describing Dave as one of the great unrecorded songwriters in the area. Times change. Dave has released a great debut solo CD that surely lives up to its promise. More importantly, Dave conveys those songs on stage like he's been doing it whole life, with passion, presence, and an irascible charm that will win over any audience. Great songs. Great CD."
4,A genre classic - finely crafted and worth reading,"This second installment by PN Elrod continues the story of an Ace Reporter turned Vampire. When his girlfriend is held hostage, watch out.But enough about the plot, which is pulp in the finest sense. The real reason to buy and savor this book is because it is a classic. PN Elrod's easy noir narration and stunning though sparce imagery set it apart from lesser novels. But more importantly this novel, though set in an earlier, gangster era, came out in the early nineties about the time when fantasy started modernizing from medieval to contemporary times, making this one of the series that spawned the birth of what we now call the urban fantasy genre.It's also a fun read."
2,This book is no ACE,"This is a good book for getting familiar with Premiere 6.5, but if you're goal is the ""ACE Certification"" in Adobe Premiere, better find other study materials because the exam does NOT follow the lessons in this book (very diappointing)."
5,"Excellent, informative, well researched book!",This book is the best source of information anywhere regarding Paul's Boutique.Highly recommended!
3,Just a case,"While the plastic is constructed very well, and the colors are very attractive, it is in essence a plastic blue box. It stores the MDs ok I suppose, but in my experience they shift around too much. Perhaps with more individual slots for minidiscs this problem could be avoided."
2,"Great book, inaccurately described","I want to make it clear that this is a well written fascinating book about an awesome fearless woman who did an extraordinary thing. After my wife, who is the horse person of our family, was through, I read it as well and thoroughly enjoyed it.I am giving it a low star rating because the ""new"" copy I received from Amazon had a thick black Magic Marker line across the bottom of the pages. Meaning this is an overstock, rejected, surplus book. That should have been noted in the description by Amazon.So, great book, scammed by Amazon."
4,An interesting read!,Last of the Saddle Tramps by Messanie Wilkins was an interesting book about a particularly fascinating woman. She was a woman who seized hope and the opportunity to go forth on an amazing adventure after her life to a bad turn and her options looked pretty bleak. All of this took place after the woman was well past the age most women would consider such an adventure. It is not particularly well written in novel form but is more her memoirs of her travels in her own words. I really enjoyed it.
4,Last of the Saddle Tramps,"The book was good, a very interesting story, saying alot about the way life was 40 some years ago. The service from Amazon was exellent."
4,Ficara - Stormy Weather,"If you like the music heard on The Weather Channel in the last few years, then you'll LOVE this CD! ..."
2,Laserlight DVD (Delta Entertainment) is not in color!,This DVD of Angel and the Badman/John Wayne on Film inclues a black & white Angel and the Badman using a poor quality transfer to DVD. An inferior copy of the film was obviously used. Obtain the DVD from the Goodtimes company if you want a good black & white copy. The colorized version used to be available on Republic vhs. I don't know if it still is. Get the Goodtimes Dvd or the Republic VHS and enjoy this great movie with John Wayne and Gail Russell. The supporting actors are also to be commended for adding human touches to their roles. Laserlight did a great DVD job with The Vanishing Lady (Hitchcock) but not with Angel and the Badman.
1,Ruined my life,"Do not recommend. It will show you truths not meant to be known to mankind. If you want to keep your sheltered little bubble and ignore the real truth about our world, stop reading.As the description said, technically it doesn't just detect flying objects that are unidentified, it picks up disturbances caused by alien craft. This distinguishes unidentified planes and such from actual alien vehicles. However, when I bought it, the detector went off with everything. Cars, planes, helicopters, even my printer. It took me a while to understand, but I finally know.We're the space aliens. We've been them all along. And I've been a fool to think otherwise.I just can't take this knowledge. It.... it's too much. This is the last thing I'm writing. I hope some of you can cope with it more than I can."
3,Seemingly effective.,"This seems to be effective. I got it earlier this week, plugged it in, and...well...it just sat there. But just tonight it started flashing and beepi"
1,Do not buy this item,"Do not buy this so called ""UFO detector"". It's not a detector at all, it's a transmitter. A wireless transmitter with a direct link to the government. Don't you think they'd love to keep tabs on all the true believers our there? They want to know who you are, and what you're doing at all times. They know you're on to them. Aliens exist, but they're not like you see in the movies. Silicon based life-forms. It's been a cover up for years. Now, in a near transparent ploy, the government is tracking down everyone who knows about the 'others' through the one product that all of them would buy. A genuine UFO detector. It's so obvious that it hurts my brain just thinking about it. You buy this product; the next day guys in suits show up at your front door (you can't run, there's a guy at the back door too).If I can only figure out a way to reverse engineer this thing to figure out where exactly the signal is being sent."
2,This not work!,"We here. This thing not find us. It not work. We watch you from afar. You think, why we post on here? We post because we want become friend. We not like movie. We not want blow up congress. We not want steal water. We not want eat you. Most time not want put thing in butt. When human ready, we show you us. For now, we wait."
4,Works TOO well!,"This product is lovely. It goes off every time that an alien is in the vicinity. The only problem is I can't seem to find a way to turn it off. It's rather too much when my friend John Smith comes over. He was trying to show me this lovely old police box, but this alarm would not shut off long enough for him to explain what it was that he was showing me. He must have some alien powder on him or something. I don't need my friends disturbed because this thing thinks their an alien! It would be especially bad because John has volunteered to take me on an adventure to ""see the stars"" (I think he's taking me to a planetarium.)"
4,Ruined my surprise party!,"I keep this bad boy strapped to my spring boots, so I know if any of my space buddies are in the neighborhood (they don't have cell phones). They were mysteriously absent for weeks before my birthday, until the UFO-02 ruined the surprise party they had planned for me! There should be a special function for these occasions.Also, the product description doesn't tell you that the 02 model only picks up plasma core ships, not the crystal cores. It seems odd to leave that out of the description. The 01 is for crystal, 02 - plasma, and 03 picks up both but can be spotty.Overall, having space buddies is well worth much more than the cost..."
2,Critical Flaw,"If you're hiding in a hedge waiting for a UFO to make an appearance, bear in mind that nothing attracts attention like a beeping plastic cylinder with sixteen flashing LEDs. So instead of settling a bet with your brother-in-law Eric, you might find yourself on the business end of something called (I think) a ""dermal inverter."" And you might also now have a recurring nightmare where little David Bowie impersonators make fun of your math skills."
3,You guys are mean !,"I read all the reviews, and you were all saying it was fantastic. So I bought two. Surprise ! Just a little plastic thing with a non-included 9-volt battery. So I bought two. Totally inefficient, useless piece of decoration.With all that, I got slapped in the face by E.T. while I was sleeping, again."
2,Barely useful,"This device is only good for detecting the greys, which are not the ones to be looking out for. This would be a lot more useful if it also detected Reptoids."
1,Didn't work.,"A silent triangular-shaped aircraft the size of a football field was spotted by my neighbors flying directly over my house, and what does this thing do? Sit there, silently. Mocking me as I missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In fact, the only time it has ever sounded the alarm is when it heard Michele Bachmann speak on television. I already knew she was ""out there,"" I didn't need this hunk of junk to tell me that.Save your money and wait for the UFO-03."
4,Interesting conversation piece,"To be frank, I purchased this product because of its reviews. I received it in good shape and set it in my living room with some other eclectic items I've collected over the years. I was shocked the first time it did something, so I started doing some simple research and experimentation. Apparently this device does detect magnetic fields, as it reacted when I brought it close to my neodymium magnets. But after a little research I found that the spontaneous flashing and beeping was timed almost perfectly with increased solar activity. After, I used it to impress my friends with my knowledge and perfect timing of the sun's flares (we're all big science geeks btw). Anyways, it turned out to be a really fun product despite its inability to detect our presence. 4 stars."
1,"Sorry, my mistake...","What the...???? This is for detecting Unidentified Flying Objects?? Crap, I bought one, but I thought it was for detecting Uniformed Female Officers. NOW what? How am I supposed to satisfy my obsession (some say fetish, but whatever..) with female cops? I mean they're so cute in their little uniforms... and the handcuffs! I REALLY like the handcuffs! I am sorely disappointed."
1,The TSA confiscated it!,"I bought this for my trip to Roswell. At airport security, I put it in the bin on the conveyor belt, with my laptop and ipad. The TSA agent took it off the belt to examine it and it started flashing and beeping.After that, I was surrounded by four TSA agents and an armed soldier. I got a full pat-down and search of all my bags. An hour later, I was finally allowed to leave--but they confiscated my UFO detector. Which was still blinking. I guess it was broken, hence the one star review!"
2,No IPhone Support!,"At first I thought this was a toy or scam, but the device has changed everything. I am now more aware of my surroundings. Last week I adverted an alien abduction. During my trip to new mexico, the alien detector setoff while I was relaxing in my hotel room. Needless to say, I packed my things and left. Had I stayed one more minute who knows what would have happened to me. If I had one complain is that it does not connect to my Iphone. I would be ideal if it did. I carry my Iphone everywhere at home. I don't necessarily want to carry the alien detector. If this could call my Iphone or send text messages, it would be great. Timing is everything!"
1,Oral equivalent of a train wreck,"Here's a simple formula:Creed-No Talent HacksTribute to Creed-Iffy at bestNo Talent Skanks singing tribute to Creed=End of days.Some store that I was in was playing this garbage. I left and I will never go back. Do you think ""Arms Wide Open"" can sound any worse??? Listen to this and you'll be begging for Scott Staph Infection to sing you to sleep."
2,Does not work,"I tried to charges an iphone and my GPS at the same time with this device. It would only charge one item at a time, which defeats the purpose."
1,Not as good as it looks,The actual item isn't a quality clock - its really small (I didn't pay attention to the product measurements if they were published) and the projection bulb was burnt upon arrival.
5,Exquisite,"The book is an eclectic mix of old and new poetry. As the favorites of individual people in the range of life, the book has many poems you might not come into contact with otherwise; of course, the classics are there: John Donne, Yeats, ect, but also the newer poets and a few I've never heard of before. Excellent book."
3,Nice Selections But Horrible Navigation,"The reading selections are nice, if not exactly contemporary, but the lack of navigation from the table of contents makes the vocabulary list rather useless when reading as it is at the end of the book."
4,Good Read for Learners of Spanish,"This book is great for 2nd or 3rd year Spanish students. The Spanish seems to be an older version, but still very understandable. I understand many of the words, and can guess the meaning of new words by the context. The content is interesting and has variety. Read it as you would an article or novel, without looking up every new word, and you will get the general idea, and learn new words in the process. It works very well on the Kindle. It would be nice to be able to link it to a Spanish dictionary, but has not been a necessity. It does have an active table of contents."
3,It's okay be not great.,It would have been helpful to have a vocabulary or a translation for us beginners. Also its difficult on Kindle to go back and forth to a dictionary .
1,I don't know any Spanish!,"This is written entirely in Spanish and assumes that you know Spanish. I thought is was a beginners Spanish primer, like it states, and I started going through it, and recognized like three words, only because I took French. I was terribly disappointed. This is a secondary Spanish book."
5,The Epistemology of Consciousness,"Churchland's primary goal is to demonstrate that the problem of mind-brain is reducable through neuroscience. She gives a brief history of the study of the brain, basic neuroanatomy, and talks about recent developments in the philosophy of science.Tremendous job ! Very detailed, hard reading, but extremely worthwhile"
3,"A comprehensive overview, but very lengthy","There's a lot of reading to do here. Churchland presents an overview of physiological psychology, psychological neuroscience, and philosophy and epistemology. That takes a long time. The coverage is good, the writing is OK, but the subject matter is so broad that it can't help bogging down and becoming quite a chore.The really interesting stuff starts when she reaches the edges of what we *know* and goes into theories about what we may learn in the future. That's where the book gets really interesting, it's too bad that that has to be several hundred pages into things.I would only recommend this book to those with a fierce dedication to the subject. It's definitely a challenge, but a rewarding one."
5,Movie Maniacs,"The 3 Stooges at their absolute finest! 3 Curlys; need i say more? Probably not, but the transfer is superb, and its a genuine Columbia Tristar movie. Enjoy! LOL stuff!"
2,dreadful quality....avoid unless you are a collector...,WOW this stinks...this is bootleg quality video ...a 5th generation duplication I'd say. The sound is also bad ....its just not good. I have video of some of these show that puts this to shame (VHS)...and was hoping this was a legit DVD from the source but its not. AVOID unless you need every warbely video of Chet and or Stan you can lay your hands on. AVOID...buy the CD sets they are splendid!!
2,a moderately dissatisfied customer,"I bought this storage tower thinking that it was the answer to my storage problems. However, I didn't realize that the disks must be in a plastic case in order for them to fit in the tower. Loose disks don't fit. Since I buy my disks in bulk and record onto them, I have to buy new plastic cases now, or the tower in unusable. If that had been clear from the description, I wouldn't have wasted my money"
3,Mini disc coward,"this product isn't a bad one, but its far from perfect. the thought of buying two and getting three for that price is a nobel idea, but i have to agree with some of the other reviewers. i buy the 20 packs which come in four packs of 5 discs - cheaper then buying 15 discs with covers. but buying the four packs like i do means i can't use this brand of tower. of course if you have this same problem, you can stack the discs on top of one another. doesn't look as good, but it works.overall - its an ok product, but make sure you have the cases."
5,Wonderful!,If you're smart and don't throw away the plastic case of your MDs then this storage is just for you. It's a perfect way to display your nice MDs (in its case) and shows the world how intelligent you really are :-)
1,Bunch of crap,"I am not satisfied with this product. You need the plastic cases in order for the minidiscs to fit. Do they tell you that in the description, NOPE! I bought two and wasted my money. Now they sit... and sit..."
2,Not great,"This product is overpriced for its quality. The unit is flimsy and does not hold MDs that do not have cases. So many manufacturers offer the MDs without cases, and then this holder becomes worthless."
5,Nice,"Best! very well made, It does all the functions that I need. For my old Ur quattro. For CIS injetion"
1,caution,"I love Votivo's Red Currant room spray but the one I received was without packaging and had clearly been impregnated with something else, you could see the bubbles at the top of the liquid. It smelled off and I was sorely disappointed; buy new!!!!"
2,Can't get it to run on my Profile 2.,"I can't get this to run! Even after reading all the documentation, and trying this and that and more, it won't recognize my joystick (and pedals). The flight control surfaces are stuck in extreme positions, leading to immediate crash during take-off roll.(Note: I have a Gateway Profile 2, with Celeron 466. Plus MS sidewinder professional joystick, plus Cirrus rudder pedals)."
3,flight unlimited 3 why?,why cant you use the jetliners that are shown in the pick an aircraft screen? That irritates me. other than that this game is one of the best flight sims i've ever played. this game is very realistic and very customizable. i use a sidewinder precision 2 joystick and it just makes flight a breeze. if your into flight sims you wouldn't be doing bad buying this game. oohhh another thing is that i would like the graphics to be a little better...but thats just me...i'm a graphice freak!!!
1,Total Loss,"If I could I would give it no stars. The program will not run at all on my system, a BRAND NEW P-III, 700MHz, 128 MB RAM, and 64MB NVIDIA video card. EA Support blames my system, or my drivers, whatever, anything but their product. But after following their suggestions for a solution, the game still locks my computer up as soon as I hit the ""fly"" button. Forget about it."
4,To Be Real,"Excellent ATC interaction, weather generation, and all-around realism. Would hope for more detailed and interactive instrumentation on secondary aircraft in future versions (such as interactive instrumentation available on the Beechjet.) One big problem is that the approach light systems (ALS)are non-existent, a feature that Microsoft has down pretty well."
2,Nothing Special,I'm a big fan of the Fear Street series and it's author RL Stine but this book was not so good. I figured out the ending early on and even though it was sorta original I found the book to be boring...so boring in fact that I refuse to buy the second one. Trust me people it's a waste of money...If you choose to read it make sure you check it out of the library..
4,fear hall=very good,"the story is about Hope who lives in Fear Hall, she shares a room with some friends in here. She has got this terribly sick boyfriend who is jealous as hell. He basically kills everything that touches her (or that is what he thinks). But in the end all is not what it seems........This book was so original and exciting and gory sometimes. I only gave it four stars since I kinda figured out the ending in the middle of the story. But it still came as a complete shock to me. READ IT!"
2,This Book is better than the second one.,I though this book was as good as any other of R.L. Stine's books. I think he is a great author with a lot of talent. I don't think this book was really in the Fear Street collection because there was only a dorm called Fear Hall. I think this book could have been better with a little work
1,Stupider Than Usual - Why Do I Still Read Stine's Books?,"I have just finished reading this book and as soon as I put it down I logged onto the internet, for I feel morally obliged to warn the rest of humanity about this book. I wish it were possible to choose half a star, or even better yet, no star, as a rating for I feel that one star is WAY to generous. The basic plot - guy kills guy talking to girl who he thinks is his gf; is actually gf's roomate wearing her clothes. This happens twice. Why doesn't the girl just stop lending out her clothes? At the end of the book we learn that none of the main characters actually exist, it was all a product of the girlfriend's imagination. What possessed me to borrow another one of Stine's book? I've learnt my lesson, I swear. No wonder there was a letter on the back cover from the author practically begging people to buy the sequel. No thanks. I've already exceeded my recommended stupidity intake for the year."
3,"Not a review, but for what its' worth...","Most of the Soldiers used in the Rank film were USAF Airman stationed at Chateauroux AFB Base in Indre. They were selected, because they were in good condition, mostly tall and had short hair. The monk/priest, who gave the last rites, was also an Airman. In the guillotine scenes, He winged it and used the sign of the cross. The Director loved it! Unfortunately, he did it backwards and being sticklers for the truth, the Director cut his great ad-lib. So much for a brush with fame. They did serve great food."
1,Never Received This Product and Inquiring Emails never answered,"I ordered this for my grand-daughter who was moving to Idaho and wanted to see it before she had to read the book. I paid for this product, the seller TOOK my money, the product NEVER CAME and the emails that I and my wife wrote to the seller went unanswered. We will hesitate before ever doing this again."
2,Bad tape,"I sent for a tape of ""Tale of Two Cites"" It came promptly but unfortunately was of poor quality. I couln't tune out the lines out on the tape using the tracking function. C'est la vie. Don't have the time to repackage the VHS version and send it back. I don't plan to buy anymore VHS tapes on the internet.I'll stick to local vendors where I can return the VHS tapes the next day. Everything should now be converted to DVD anyway."
3,chinese/cinemasie/hk flix = the castaways pictures,"I saw this in TV; I am a great fan of Dirk Bogarde and thought he made a superb Sidney Carton...so, I order this DVD.It has chinese subtitles...so, I wend my way thru the companies involved in producing it....The Castaways Pictures seems to be bound up with Cinemasie and also with HK Flix...be nice if the ad specified it was an Asian production. I bought an Asian DVD of Song Without End/Dirk Bogarde...it had scenes deleted, was grainy and sound was poor at times...in fact, I went and got another copy of the VHS I had given my sister when I got the DVD. So, with fear and trepidation, I sat down to watch this DVD...it was not of the quality that you expect from a DVD. But, seems to be the only version of this adaptation available."
2,Everybody is just going through the motions. Lacks verve and class.,"My downgrading of this film is more severe than any posted here because I bailed out even before Charles Darnay decided to return to France. The characters are cardboard, deeds are extremely evil or 100% noble/good, nothing in between, and watching the film unfold is like watching a film director painting unimaginatively by the numbers. Dirk Bogarde is studiously bored and a very unconvincing drunk. Even the storming of the Bastille is something perfunctory and dutiful. Everyone is trudging wearily along the path marked out by Dickens, getting their time card punched and bored with what they're doing. Anyone hoping for a Dickens with the magic of the Ealing Studios/Alec Guiness GREAT EXPECTATIONS is advised to look elsewhere."
1,What a waste of money!,"A predictable, pedestrian storyline, coupled with a text that appears not to have even been proofread, never mind edited, make for a big waste of the time it takes to read this book. I have never been so disappointed in an Amazon recommendation. I would give this book less than one star if I could."
3,"Oops, I made a Mistake....","I counted on the reviews of others to find something new and fresh to read while I waited patiently for my ""regulars"" to publish their new and best works.....but, I was let down. The story itself was so-so. I have to say though, meeting someone online and meeting them ""anywhere"" else....really, what is the difference? You never really no anyone! The errors in spelling and grammer do play on your mind after awile (what were the editors thinking- maybe they were out to lunch!) If you need to fill some time and are not to picky, try the book, but if you are trying to decide between this one and another.....pick the other one!"
2,Simple story,"I would agree that it is a quick read. However, I found the storyline to be rather simple as were the characters. I was shocked at the number of misspelled words and poor punctuation in the book. I would have a hard time recommending this book to anyone I know that is an avid reader for the mere fact that it is a very simple story and very predictable."
5,Betrayal of Trust,"I was very pleased to find this book. It was not only captive in it's contents but it had a great lesson about computer ""(friendships) the other side of truth-trust and vunerability. I rate this novel a big 5 star. Good work Cheryl Bourne"
5,Fun little Ecchi Love story,"Lots of innuendo, lack of modesty, and all around comedy. Follows the manga fairly well except in a few spots, but still highly entertaining."
5,Confused mom needs to know,"I bought ""Pure Engagement"" and ""Sekirei: Complete Series"" for my son. He wants ALL Sekirei DVDs available. Do these two cover everything? I read that the Complete Series is just season 1. Is there a Season 2? Is that what Pure Engagement is? He is 22 and disabled and lives in a nursing home and he absolutely loves anime and at the moment this is his FAVORITE one. I want to get him everything that's out there, but it looks to me like in purchasing these 2 sets, he has them all. Am I right? Thanks for helping."
4,METROPLEX,"This guide gives a very good overview of Dallas, as well as Fort Worth, I am familiar with both cities and whomever wrote the guide has actually done their homework, which quite frankly is not always the case in guides of this sort. The guide's reviews for the most part are spot on, and I liked the maps, even though I am familar with Dallas I did learn a thing or two from this guide, which surprised me. Fodor's guides are normally well researched and this one does not disappoint and most of the guide is very current. If you are someone planning to visit the Metroplex, then I recommend you picking up this guide, it will give you a nice overview of the area and set you on the right track to having an enjoyable time in these most enjoyable cities."
5,You have to read this book,"This is a rare book. I can't stopping reading it, and I'm not a special fan of science fiction, but this masterpiece is beyond all classification. Follow my advise and read it."
2,"Looks good, but...","This toy was attractive and interested a four year old for about ten minutes, but the sounds it made were not very loud and it was difficult to operate. The Rockin' Riffs Guitar needs a strap of some sort. A very young child cannot hold the thing and operate it at the same time."
2,OK for Middle-school level overview,"The author provides a bibliography of her sources. Because of that, the reader can see that she did not take the time nor the effort to research primary resources. The entire book is a compilation of gleanings from other secondary sources. One chapter had only one source, making it more like a book report than a work of historical quality. The stories seem to wander around Colorado and the region as much as the outlaws themselves did. I would expect the same level of writing from a 6th or 7th grader, not a serious researcher of history. Save your money and get this one from the library."
2,Simple,"It seems as though the series needed a filler, so they blew some dust off one of the older series' scripts, changed the names, and let the cameras roll. There was no immediacy to the story, since it was so cliche that we the audience knew every beat before it occurred."
1,Where are episodes #2 and #24 for Enterprise Season 2?,"It is really cool to be able to download episodes and play it on the computer. The Unbox player works well, but sometimes it freezes when switching from full screen into a different mode. The down side? Well, the first disappointment was that I was not able to play the files on my Zune. The second problem is that Season 2 has two missing episodes and Amazon was not able to explain why (at least until now, and after asking twice). If the episodes are not available at least the web site should have mentioned that the season was partial. I would have given more stars but the partial set of episodes spoils the package.I also suggest care on using the ""brightness"" and ""contrast"" controls of the ""Unbox player"". When the player is initially installed both controls are set at 50% be default, which generates a horrible image (at least on my computer). You may want to adjust the controls to get a better picture."
3,"Not bad, not great","The other person who wrote a review was rather accurate. This episode does have the feel of being a ""filler."" Unfortunately, this episode along with several before it are a lull in the scripts being made. It is predictable. I was expecting Hoshi to say, ""I see dead people. Oh wait, I am dead."" Kidding aside, this episode can be safely passed over without losing much of the continuing story (what little there is at this point). I still liked the episode, although it didn't introduce any new characterization. However, Hoshi's father is Ba-Ba-Baram from the cheesy Surf Ninja's movie, so I was expecting him to bust some moves."
4,how can you not love Borg?,"like most fans, i love the storylines that include Borg. while i think that Captain Archer would have more realistically gotten his arse handed to him, this was still a highly enjoyable episode."
3,RICK BERMAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!!!,"This is a review about the overall series not just season 2. Don't get me wrong I LOVE STAR TREK, but this series didn't get me hooked at all. This could have been a great series. It had a great actor for archer, overall character devolopment and a star trek legend behind it all: RICK BERMAN. So you're thinking, Why did I give this 3 stars? Two words.LOUSY SCRIPTS!!!! These Episodes are so booooooooring!!!!! THe characters make terrible dicisions in tight situations and they only come out on top by luck. It is a joy to see the characters grow, but it is shame to see them tarnished by the poor scripts. In season 2 The only good one is REGENERATION which brings back the spirit of TNG. Season 4 on the other hand is great and brings back old STAR TREK. So unless you are a die hard STAR TREK fan you might as well skip this series."
1,To boldly go...,"...where everyone but the pathetic human race has already been!There was nothing original about this series, just ST:TNG transported back 200 years. Time travel, alternate universes, transporter accidents, blah, blah, blah!The creators stuck with a formula that seemd to work for three other shows, but with Enterprise they had a chance to do something really special, and they blew it. There was absolutely no feeling of going where no one had gone before, because all the humans really had to do was download the Vulcan data base. They were nothing but ""Johnny-come-latelys"" in this show.Don't waste your time with this garbage!"
2,The Beginning Of The End,"From the first epsiode of 'Enterprise's' season two the show started to quickly go downhill.One reason was too many 'bubble' episodes that took place ONLY on the NX-01.That and too many shows about Captain Archer getting in trouble,or squabling alien races that get Captain Archer in trouble or better yet,watching another episode of this this show drag on and on without anything really happening.The show should've gotton a mercy killing here-the last two shows of season 4 were the best of the whole series almost and just about everything in between was dullsville.Where TOS,TNG,DS9 and Voyager all had dozens of classic Star Trek episodes for EACH series four full seasons of Enterprise had no classics to speak of and only about half a dozan good shows over four whole years.What a mess."
1,"Rolling, rolling, rolling...","...straight to the bottom of the trash heap!In Season 2, Enterprise continues its descent into oblivion!UPN was smart to drop this stinker."
4,GOOD SCI FI,"EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM THE ENTERPRISE SAGA, GOOD TO WATCH, AND KEEP ONE OCCUPIED, ABOUT A 7 1/2 ON THE SCALE OF 10 IF YOUR A SI FI FAN, A COUPLE OF EPISODES WERE A LITTLE SOGGY, SOME CARACTERS IN OTHERS WERE PREDICTABLE, BUT SOMETHING TO PUT UP ON THE TUBE"
4,Star Trek Enterprise - 2nd Season,I is nice to have the video on hand to review and enjoy at my liesure. The video quality was better than season one.
4,Enterprise,Very good TV show. To bad it was cancelled. I am watching season 4 as i type this review from my Iphone.
3,Wrong Director listed carried over from previous episode?,"It appears the wrong director is credited for this episode, one of my favorites. It was directed by Levar Burton as it shows on screen in opening credits and on Memory Alpha."
2,omg Padma's acting is THE worst,"Padma's awful acting made watching this episode so painful that I couldn't finish. I thought that maybe her character would go away, but she had a major role. I wish I was warned..."
4,A good continuation of the Andorian/Vulcan conflict,"This is the third appearance of the Andorian Shran, who seems to be one of the more level-headed of his race. This show also continues the character development of the Vulcans beyond what Spock gave us. While not as good as the two prior appearances of the Andorians, this one is still a good adventure. I wouldn't recommend passing this episode by as I have said of the past few reviews I've done of this season."
3,Hit & Miss Season 2 is Recommended for Hardcore Fans Only,Let me start by saying I am a mad Sci-fi fan and have seen just about everything. Season 2 is hit and miss. 50% of the episodes are not worth watching and the other 50% are great. If you are a real fan then it is worth it for the casual viewer I would not recommend it.For the casual viewer I recommend Star Trek Enterprise Season 3 which is truly excellent. Most surprising. The introduction of a long and good story arc makes this season great for fans and casual viewers alike.
4,DVD far better than TV,"The Season One cliffhanger finally got my attention. The DVDs avoid the day, date, time, and station confusion and the commercial interruptions. I'd actually rate Season Two a 5, but the difficult to use plastic DVD case and inconvenient DVD menu options, suggest a lower grade. What ever happened to the ""one click"" ""Play All""? Finally, Season Two delivers! You won't be disappointed."
2,"""Enemy Mine"" rip-off","In 1985 a mediocre Sci-Fi movie came out called ""Enemy Mine"" where an Alien and a Human crash land on a desert like planet....at first they fight and almost kill each other, then they end up helping each other. I know Star Trek has been known to rip-off other Sci-Fi books and movies (and it frequently re-hashes it's own material), but this is almost straight up plagiarism. Just watch the trailer for ""Enemy mine"" and you'll have watched this episode: [...]Aside from that whole fiasco, the episode itself was quite laborious to get through and the ending felt contrived and rushed. I'd recommend skipping this one, it's rare that I say that."
3,Classic? hahaha...oh you were serious .___.,"That reviewer might be one of the only people on this planet to ever say that...most people regard this as the worst of this series...if not all Star Trek. I didn't think it was that bad, but it certainly wasn't 5 star or ""classic"" worthy...and I love dogs. ""Night in Sick Bay is an ensamble coalescing the cast around the Captain's dog that brings out the soul of this series."" none of that even makes sense...did you even watch it?The episode itself is watchable, but right off the bat it's ridiculous...Why on earth is there another contrived half naked gel rubdown scene? What is the flippin' point?It was pretty obvious that the producers of this show were trying desperately to sexualize Star Trek, but c'mon there's probably pornography with better story. It's just disappointing considering how amazing this season has been so far."
4,The adventure continues,"The opening episode has an interesting plot line involving time travel and the ""Future Guy."" The Vulcan history episode, ""Carbon Creek"" was awesome, so was the Romulan first contact episode, ""Minefield"" written by X Files great Frank Spotnitz. The Tholian episode, ""Future Tense"" and the Borg episode ""Regeneration"" are probably the best."
3,More of the same,"Sadly the other reviewer of this episode is correct, if a little too blunt in their assessment. The only reason I enjoyed this episode was the polygamous Denobulans and Dr. Flox's wife hitting on poor, hapless, moral Trip. If you've watched this series you know the Denobulans are polygamists and evidently they have no qualms about hitting on someone directly in front of one of their spouses. It was comical to watch, even if I have to side with Trip's point of view."
3,"Missing Ep # 2 and #24, not a complete season 2.","I bought the season thinking it was complete. It is not. Might be a mistake, might not."
3,Ups and downs in its sophomore season,"Star Trek: Enterprise had a bumpy beginning with its first season, with some dull shows that turned off many viewers permanently, causing a ratings slide that it never recovered from. In its second, there were some very strong episodes and just as many clunkers and unoriginal stories rehashed from years past. However, by the end of the second season, the episodes got stronger and reached a high point with the attack on Earth by the Xindi.The extras on the DVD are all worth watching, especially the hilarious outtakes."
3,Love the series,"Love the series, hated the way this set was sent/received. I would have sent back and asked for a replacement if I had a way to do so."
5,great show,This episode was brilliant! The plot was unique and the story was well presented. Easily one the best episodes of the series.
3,Ratings low? Let's put T'Pol in heat,"Okay okay I know it can be tough making a TV show, getting people to watch it and all that. But you don't always have to resort to gel rubbing false Vulcan condition contrived sexualizations....ever try good writing and story? That usually works too.For the past 50 years of Star Trek the Ponn Farr has been an exclusively Vulcan male condition....but I guess that's not true. That makes me doubt the motives of this silly sub plot, but whatever it provided some goofy uncomfortable moments. The kind of goofy uncomfortable moments that happen in horribly written porn movies where they try and make an excuse that leads to the sex part. Basically every 7 years the Vulcans have to RAPE the nearest opposite sex (this one was forced early...by the writers) Ya know, the more I learn about Vulcans the less logical they seem.Oh yea and by the way the main plot is good, who doesn't love a Sci-Fi Bounty Hunter story?"
1,"Skip the book, see the movie.","Unfortunately, the book has none of the style, wit, or raw seductive power of the movie. To be fair, it's probably a mistake to compare the two, as the storylines differ in vitually every way. Those who like myself, bought the book because they enjoyed the movie, will probably be dissapointed by this. On it's own, however, the book still cannot stand on its own merits. It's a prime example of supermarket fiction: one-dimensional characters, silly dialogue, and ridiculous plot. It thoroughly lacks believability, and at times appears to be a blatant rip-off of an earlier bestseller written by a certain ex-lawyer from Mississippi. All-in-all, it's definately a book for the undemanding."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I was prompted to buy this book based on the film. I adored the movie. It has become one of my favorites. Imagine my surprise when I opened the book to find not just a bland, slow, tiresome read, but a stylistic atrocity! Neiderman writes like a sixth grader. His use of rhetorical questions and foreshadowing plays to the lowest common denomenator. It boggles the mind that anyone would publish this hack (speaking of which, there are numerous blatant grammatical errors... what the hell was the editor thinking when he allowed this to go to press?) When writing a book about a place where people actually live there is some need to research (Long Island towns don't have small town mentalities, especially in Nassau County). Needless to say, don't waste your money, but definately see the movie. The screen writer deserves an academy award for turning this pedestrian attempt at a novel into such a thought provoking film."
1,Makes you wish for a 0-star rating...,"If you have enjoyed the movie, then by all means do NOT buy this book: aside from the movie and book stories being almost completely different, it is poorly researched, poorly written, the characters are uninteresting, the text is full of clichés, and the ending is so atrocious it'll make you want to throw up. Go see the movie, instead. P.S.: Kudos to the screenwriter(s) that managed to turn this book into a very nice movie script..."
1,dreadful,"Don't waste your time. The premise is interesting enough, but how is it possible for a writer to make the devil out to be a bore? The movie is far better."
4,A good beach book,"Maybe it's because some of the reviews were negative, but this book was better than I expected it to be. The book is very different from the movie in plot points but there are some common themes. I almost think I like Kevin Taylor better than Kevin Lomax (and believe me, I adore the film). The book moves quickly, and it's not particularly challenging -- reasons why I would categorize it as a beach read."
2,Ehh,"The movie caught my eye, and I was thinking, the book's gotta be better. Right? More often than not, a book trumps a movie hands-down, though some adaptations have turned out to be decent efforts. This book is from the same man who ghostwrites the V.C. Andrews novels (and the books he writes under her name are just god-awful) but I figured that if someone wanted to make a movie from this book, then the book had to be good... right? Right???NO! The screenplay is actually better than the book! I could see echoes of Neiderman's lame ""VCA-esque"" writing in here especially with the bland dialogue. Some parts were all right, but overall the book fell rather flat and it left me surprised at how such a good (if somewhat disturbing) movie could have been greenlighted from this book. It is definitely better than a one-star, but I just couldn't bring myself to give it anything higher than two stars."
1,AWFUL,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK SOLELY BECAUSE I LOVED THE DVD AND PRESUMED (WRONGLY)THAT SINCE THE SCREENPLAY WAS BASED UPON THIS BOOK, THE BOOK WOULD COMPLIMENT THE MOVIE AND OFFER MORE INSIGTHT. WRONG I WAS. THE ONLY WAY THIS BOOK RESEMBLES THE AL PACINO MOVIE IS THAT THE TITLE IS THE SAME AND THE KEY CHARACTERS ARE NAMED KEVIN AND JOHN MILTON. TERRIBLE PLOT AND STORY. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE MOVIE."
2,OK,IT WILL DO THE JOB BUT INSTEAD OF AN XLR CONNECTION ON THE BACK YOU HAVE TO WIRE IT IN DIRECTLY? PRETTY STUPID IN MY OPINION TO HAVE TO RUIN AN XLR CABLE TO HOOK IT UP.
3,Much smaller than expected,I bought these stickers to decorate some party favor bags for my son's construction themed party. The stickers were cute but the adhesive seemed to be lacking. They did not stick well to the bags at all. The size of the booklet is about the size of my hand.
4,"Authentic, good size",My two year old grandson with a passion for large truck type stuff liked the stickers. We used them as potty training rewards.
2,"Good stickers, but feel like I've been ripped off","I was very pleased with these stickers - my son likes realistic pictures of construction vehicles. They seem good quality. However, I feel ripped off because the price on the back of the book is $1.50 (see photos). The Amazon price is $3. I would give 3 or 4 stars for the product itself but one star for the price."
5,Very realistic drawings,My son absolutely loves these. They are by far the most realistic looking construction stickers out there - and everything is labeled with the technical name!
1,Very disappointed,"I bought these stickers for my grandson but didnot give them to him-instead, I'm returning them. Because they are in a ""book"" I thought I was at least getting a book that has a scene to put the stickers on, if not a little story with them. But there is nothing but stickers-the same as I can get at the dollar stores. This is hardly an ""activity"" book."
2,Not worth buying online,"These are regular old stickers, fine for a child who likes construction equipment, BUT, the book is small - 16 stickers, roughly 1 x 2"" each. The manufacturer's price is $1.50, it costs more than double that amount to order these online. Disappointing."
2,Not A Wu Banger,"The Movement is wack.Here's why: average beats.1/2 was produced by Ayatollah who is kinda a hit or miss producer, in Decks case a miss.The other half produced by Hass G (UMC's) also produced Apolo Kids.The lp is full of generic cornball hooks.INS is an ill mc but has used weak beats for both his solo efforts.Imagine Deck over the beats from Liquid Swords, it would be classic.Overall for me it was just like Uncontrolled Substance, disappointing."
4,the realist,wutang has change over the last 7 years when u listen to wutang u get very smart indaveual when i buy a new cd from any of the 9 members solos album i listen to the lyrics first then the beat cause they got hot production i must tell the truth i didnt like this album when i first listen to it am stupid because this is a very good album.
4,"New Deck album noy for everyone, but....","...if you are looking for true hip hop in today's watered down hip hop culture, look no further. Deck's style is still as raw as ever and his vocal style has taken on a new, more mature flow. The lack of any RZA production and the absence of any real WU cameos take away any chance at the fifth star, but for my money this disc was a must have."
5,Deck's unorthodox style of attack. NEW ALBUM.,"Yo whatup, I already heard the album because I'm in the music business so I got a copy. When you hear it, the beats are gonna be material that you're not use to from Deck, but the lyrical flow is still the same. I'm really feelin' this album!! A different sound for hip-hop. Not that looped sound that MC's are puttin'out na mean!! WU-TANG, THE BEST RAP GROUP OF ALL TIME!! Holla"
4,Bangin,"Straight bangin, and Mike last time I checked Killa Sin was a member of Killa Army who are Wu so get you facts right prior to your review"
2,Just not quite up to par,"I expected this album to be a lot better after the under the radar classic ""Uncontrolled Substance"". Sadly, this CD is pretty poor by Wu Tang standards. There are a few bright spots, but overall this album sounds too commercial to be a Deck record. Still, INS is a great lyricist and I wouldn't give up on him yet."
4,still spittin darts for the art,"Since 93 the debut of the super rap group the wu-tang clan. The rebel INS came back with a new album, after the uncontrolable subtance gone gold without out comercial support and poor advertizement from his ol record lable, this artist knows how to hold his own. This album his a wu banga with his street smart rhymes sharin the knowledge to those in the streets. Whever never hear about inspectah deck ask the wu bangas what he's all about. He's a well respected lyricist check out some of these songs that he was feature in and his first album (tres leches by big pun,cloud above by gang star, etc....)"
5,Hot to Deck,NIce. Exceptional hooks and incredible lyrics from deck. Real good s***. Makes me want to cruise real slow down federal in a Hummer with a high end audio ensemble. Too bad I dont have either. This is the kind of cd that will get alot repeat listenings.
3,Slightly better than Uncontrolled Substance,"Deck's second effort is only a slight improvement on his previous release, Uncontrolled Substance. However it's not any worse than Meth or Raekwon's most recent albums. This is probably the only true Wu solo... conspicuously missing are any collabos with his Wu brethren and the famous W logo. Perhaps Rza has overlooked arguably the most unrealized potential from the Wu. That's the reason why he seems to save his best for other people's albums. Because he's more focused on his lyrics and not the rest of the production. But just remember this, Deck at his worst is iller than Nelly and P.Daddy at their best.City High: 4/5That Sh*t: 3.5/5Get Right: 2/5The Movement:2/5Who Got It: 2/5It's Like That:2/5Shorty Right There:1/5U Wanna Be:2/5Framed:3/5Bumpin and Grindin:2.5/5 (whack chorus cost it a star)Vendetta:4/5The Stereotype:4.5/5That Ni&&a;:3.5/5Big City:5/5Cradle to the Grave:2.5/5"
4,Rebel INS is back,"This cd is very good overall. As always, Deck comes with a steady flow in his personalized style. This cd sounds different from other Wu-Tang affiliated records, but this is expected as the RZA produces no tracks on this record and there are no Wu affiliated rappers on this except for Street Life and Killa Sin. If you are a fan of the Wu or you want to hear something besides the stale commercial rap of today, pick this album up."
1,He has betrayed the Wu-Tang Clan,"Inspectah Deck needs to go back too Shaolin and train in the 36 Chambers. Don't let the title of this album decieve you. Instead of ""The Movement"" it should be called ""the run the hell away screaming."" It is definitely the worst Wu album I have ever heard. It's nothing like his last album. If you buy this album you will end up crying. I can't even say that the lyrics are good...that's how bad this album is. Get the RZA ~ Birth of a Prince album instead of this. You will not be dissapointed."
1,What a disappointment!!,"First let me say that I ""LOVE"" Emmylou Harris. If I don't have everything she's done, it's not for lack of trying. This CD just isn't very good. I think one of the other reviews called it ""lackluster."" I think that's being gracious. Back in the bad old days before CDs and the internet, record companies used to pump out LPs of floor sweepings and sell them on the strength of the artist's name. They got away with it because they controlled the reviews and most of the time it wasn't possible to listen to any of it before purchasing it. That's what this CD impresses me as, floor sweepings. There's not one single ""HIT"" on this whole stinking CD. Soooo....if you ""LOVE"" Emmylou, and you have $16 you don't know what else to do with....just send it to her direct and spare yourself the pain."
3,Stumbling Toward Ecstasy,"Not convinced with her previous efforts [Wrecking Ball too spacey, Red Dirt Girl too art-house] why she doesn't stick to her goldmine inherencies [as the greatest backup singer of all time], she gets me this time - maybe I'm getting too old to fight off her earnestness - her erudite storytelling and ravishing and at-times flat vocals tell tales that never prove sententious, just authentic and unadulterated. My grade: B+"
3,Who Knows?,"I like Emmy Lou, and I loved her early work, but Wrecking Ball, with its meandering, amelodic ruminations, was a disappointment. (Songs can be poetic, but they shouldn't be conflated with poetry. The means are not the same, nor is the function.) I might buy this album, but I'd like to hear a couple of clips. Unfortunately, Amazon hasn't put any on the site. So I'm gonna hold fire until they do.Tom"
3,who is this?,"I'm not a fan of rockabilly type music, but this woman intrigues me. Shes no sarah mclachlan or ""love, shelby"" or sinead oconnor in her voice, but her voice touches my core. I think I will listen to the samples some more and come up with some song titles I can send to her management that she could use."
3,Deserves to be listened to,"3.5 stars. This album definitely grows on you. At first I was disappointed, and exasperated. I gave it another chance. Now I am sorry I was so harsh. It really is beautiful, but definitely not in the same class as `Wrecking Ball', which still is my favorite Emmylou's album."
2,Stumble Into Snoozeland - BORING,"Emmylou is on a roll to put the world to sleep! I thought Wrecking Ball was ok with some really great songs and several duds - the production was muddy but fit several of the songs. Unfortunately she has continued again with the very muddy production sound here which would be ok with great songs, but here the songs are just BORING - just like Red Dirt Girl. They all sound exactly the same! zzzzzzzzzzzz Avoid."
4,Back with a bang,"Emmylou Harris has turned to her own - under used - writing skills for this new release. And what a stunner it turns out to be. It is up there with Red Dirt Girl and Wrecking Ball, and brings her right in the frame again. A brilliant performance that is bound to grow on you. Highly recommended."
2,Emmylou Harris is Depressed,"Emmylou Harris is depressed!Her voice on this CD is flat - minimal emotional affect - no highs, no fun, little hope. Her photos all look down at the ground.The lyrics are OK but there is little in the music that is tuneful or melodious. It is more like a wake!At least the production is much better than the awful effort on ""Red Dirt Girl"".Sadly Emmylou is in need of help.This one will go to the bottom of her CD's - it is that bad!May she have a speedy recovery."
2,Time for EH to rethink,"I can't believe those Emmylou Harris fans gushing over this CD are actually listening to it. It really is inferior to most of her work. And I liked Red Dirt Girl a lot, and thought Wrecking Ball one of the great pop recordings ever made. But this ... it's professionally done but just lifeless. I've given it a few listens, I swear, but probably not any more. I think she is one of the great voices of our time, but she needs to rethink...."
3,Decent but Disappointing...,"Stumble Into Grace is disappointing in the same way that Iris DeMent's The Way I Should was disappointing: each arrived on the heels of two trailblazing, sublime recordings & neither seemed to remember or appropriate the boldness or vision that cleared the path for em...Roses in the Snow is iconic. The Ballad of Sally Rose irresistible. Wrecking Ball dazzles me. Red Dirt Girl is among the finest albums I've ever heard. But with Stumble Into Grace: there is loveliness but it's self-conscious loveliness...the melodies hiccup...the songwriting is uninspired. She's bunted on this new one & I'm used to her homeruns that knock the lights in a shower of sparks over the ballfield..."
1,professional but boring,"I used to be a fan of Emmylou and love what she did in the 70's and 80's. Since Wrecking ball she's taken a turn I find hard to like, record by record. This is the worst record I've spent money on for a long time. The cover art work is worth one star and I cannot deny that the album is a work well done, it's just that she's lost her voice, she's trying to be so off mainstream and serious about what she's doing and just ends up being sooo boring! There's not one single song I want to listen to again after giving it a try three times. Emmylou, try to loosen up a bit!"
4,a stroll to beauty,"This is a very welcome change from Red Dirt Girl with its excessive and intrusive ""backing"" instrumental (electronic) sounds. I especially like the last two songs on the cd. They showcase the beautiful voice that is unique to Emmylou. I find the quality of the vocals to be a bit uneven on the cd but the overall effect is very good.Highly recommended for Emmylou Harris fans who like to be able to hear her voice without the distraction of throbbing noise. The cd conjured up more of a stroll into the beauty of Emmylou's voice as opposed to any kind of stumble."
4,excellent product,I got this movie a while back it really gd condition and works well but just to let know make sure you have a region dvd player i did not have one but used a xbox360 to play it i was satisfied with it i recommand this move thank you
4,Great CD,"This is probably the only musical I will ever enjoy, however it still is good, I would love to see the actual film of it some day, and if anyone happens to have the this version on any media please contact me, does not need to be a professional copy, copied off tv is just fine with me"
2,Good if your Dillman fan,"A good companion to George Dillmans first three books. The techniques used are like the books, unrealistic in a real life or death situation. I think George Dillman has done a lot for the martial arts community, but this video make his teachings look robotic. A good video for followers of George Dillman. The techniques he shows are brief with little explanation. The video looks like it has been shot on a cheap camcorder, the lighting is not good either."
4,Elektra epoch,"Elektra has a long important sidewalk parade float in the celebration of American music. Leave it to historians to delve deeper..there is enough on this box set to have all of us wave, grin, shout out loud, sing along, and be proud as the music passes.Blues, as deep as grits, Folk, as tattered apron bits, rock and roll, as '60's kicks, all the tricks of a new way of listening to music.This set has the obscure (Dave Ray), the pure (Phil Ochs), and the sure (Doors). The hits (Judy Collins), the misses (Nico), and the damn close (Love), +the Andy Griffith Show heroes, the Dillards!Elektra gave us the swoon of Carly Simon, Bread, Queen, MC5, and she always called back. First Love is best...From the red lipstick label to the last big E..Elektra remains important special anddamn I like her sooooooooo much!"
4,Such A Shame......,"Such a shame this movie could not have apent more time developing the storyline & in the process the various lead characters as in my opinion it comes the closest of any movie I have seen that tries to tell the truth about decision-making in the highest levels of government. The fact that various real-life events were referred to proved that this was not just another fictional thriller but someone trying to make a statement of reality concerning the situation as it actually is. However truthfully this reflects the state of affairs in Britain, it does also (& perhaps more so) for that of the US.If more time & care had been taken with this film it would have been truly great. But since as with so many films it cut corners, I can only give it 4 stars."
1,I Missed Something - Thriller? Chiller? Niether,"I am not sure that espionage stories and the thinking person genre fit together very well. This movie is at all times provocative, if only because it gives you so irritatingly little to go on. And the music always swells as if something is finally going to happen and things are going to really start rolling and everything is going to come together and there is going to be some wild getaway down the back alleys of London and you get...cut to next scene with indiscernible clue. This is the kind of movie where you look at the counter on the DVD player and it says one hour ten minutes and you are thinking to yourself - wow, they are going to really have to pack a lot into the next 30 minutes, and then you look again and it says one hour 30 minutes, and you say wow, this is going to be a cracking last ten minutes, and then it's over and you wish you had watched football instead of wasting your brain and time for so long."
5,A profound lesson for my young children,"While my young children and I were visiting my dying mother, I read a chapter a night of this marvelous book to them. My daughters were 11 & 13 at the time. My youngest daughter was so affected by the moral of the story that she wrote to the author, who wrote her a very lengthy letter back. My daughter decided to take sign language in the hope of meeting the author one day and being able to communicate with her. To this day, 13 years later, this is one of our favorite books. It had the impact on my daughter the way the movie, ""Imitation of Life"" had on me at the same age. In fact, by the last chapter, I was in tears and my daughter had to read it to me!"
3,A must for discerning Monument Valley fans,"This book is essential for all lovers of Monument Valley--the bizarre, red rock triangle of Indian land in northern Arizona and southern Utah. I highly recommend it for all fans of Glen Canyon and Navajo Mountain as well.However, the book completely lacks a bibliography or any sort of source notes, and the text at times seems so much like a campfire yarn that such notes would be nice to have. Many of the book's stories are well told, but they just don't seem true.If you buy this, also buy James Knipmeyer's ""Butch Cassidy Was Here."" He examines many of the same stories and legends, but backs up his sources, and is a more careful historian."
4,Helped me get through,"I used this during my first pregnancy pretty much every day from about 8 weeks until my morning (really, all day) sickness died down around week 14. It helped me, not sure if it was the placebo affect or actually helped. I showed it to my OB and he approved it for me (each situation is different, so please check with your own OB). He looked through the ingredient list and said he could see why it might give a little relief. I had gotten mine from a local natural remedy store that is no longer there. So, I'm glad to see it offered on Amazon. I will definitely buy another bottle as soon as I find out I'm pregnant again - placebo or not it helped and is definitely worth $14.95. I didn't even go through the whole bottle with the first one, but that was 2 years ago, so it has expired."
5,Around the World in 80 Days,We are very pleased with the condition of the DVDs and appreciate the speedy delivery of the product. We highly recommend this vendor!
4,Fun Movie,"The movie is long but held my interest. A lot of money must have gone into its production, as there are elaborate scenes throughout the film, which took place across the globe. I have my doubts about the accuracy of the cultural depictions, but that's Hollywood for you. The movie is clean if you don't mind guns and gambling."
3,A traveloguethat hasn't aged as well as it might.,"This movie is a mixed bag. Where the actors are actually doing something, it is very entertaining. The many cameos of long-gone stars are delightful. But in-between are many minutes of beautiful scenery.Don't get me wrong. I love travelogues, but the long, loving shots of nothing but exotic countryside tends to wear thin after awhile."
1,Not what I had hoped for.,"It's just a bad movie. I love old movies, but this one is just real bad. I would return it if I could."
2,Around the World in 80 Days (Two-Disc Special Edition),excellent...cantinflas y david niven just only excellent
1,Get your act together,"I originally asked for D. Niven's version, yet, I got a cartoon one from you guys(!) So I reordered, hoping this time I get the right thing. It's no big deal, especially considering the lower price of the item, a used one. Only thing, is, I hate having no choice over things, and accepting them because again, it's ""no big deal."" I gave the cartoon version to a friend's kids."
5,I agree,I agree with Gary Camp. I have seen this film many times in theatres and it NEEDS at least a letterbox format. I used to have this on laserdisc but lost it. Reluctantly I'm going to buy the VHS because there isn't a letterbox DVD. Actually I am amazed that this isn't on DVD.
3,Doesn't Stand the Test of Time,"I think Halliwell's review of this film sums it up best:Victorian gentleman and his valet make a bet that they can go round the world in eighty days.Amiable large-scale pageant resolving itself into a number of sketches, which could have been much sharper, separated by wide screen spectacle. What was breathtaking at the time seems generally slow and blunted in retrospect, but the fascination of recognizing 44 cameo stars remains. The film is less an exercise in traditional skills than a tribute to its producers energy. - Leslie Halliwell, 1985."
2,"Boring, boring, boring!","I remembered this movie fondly from my youth and wanted to introduce my children to it. I can't believe how boring it is. It is pretty much a travel guide, loaded with beautiful scenery but with little or no action. If it weren't for the antics of Cantinflas, this movie would be totally worthless. David Niven's Phileas Fogg is a bore who does nothing but play cards and look at his watch. Shirley MacLaine as an Indian princess? Even the character of Detective Fixx is a bore. The theme music is beautiful and the cameo shots are fun (I learned from the bonus features that this film is the one that introduced cameo shots and from which the term ""cameo"" appearance was coined."
2,One of those old movies that doesn't age well.,"Here's lots of great old movies. ""Around the World in 80 Days"" isn't one of them.I can't believe this is rated 4.5 out of 5. Really? Maybe it was 4.5 out of 5 whenit came out and world travel wasn't common and the specticale made up for howpoor the rest of the movie is.. Now though 50% or more of the movieis spent on travel scenery and it's not even impressive scenery like like sayLawerence of Arabia. You can see better scenery on the National Geographic channelor the Travel Channel.The rest is slow. The comedy too silly for the subject matter. David Niven's characteris wholy unlikeable. The 20 something woman falling for the 50 something man cliche' fromthat period is completely unbelievable. There's no chemistry and if she was going to fallfor anyone she should be falling for the man who actually saved her, not his ""master"".But like many movies of the era that ""everything leads to marriage"" is just shoved in thereand has nothing to do with anything."
3,A visit to an old favorite,"I bought a copy of the original movie, Around the World in 80 days, because I hadn't seen it in years and the Art director was an old friend, Jimmy Sullivan. After seeing the movie, I read the original book just to compare the two. It was great fun and I would recommend both movie and book."
5,Around the World in 80 Days,"This is Michael Todd's original movie, not the remake. It is long (182 Minutes) but this ia a great movie. It won five academy awards including best picture. As anyone might guess, it is about a man who bets he can make it around the world in 80 days (it takes place many years ago). It has great actors, great music and a great plot. It is well worth the price I paid for it."
2,AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS,I only give this one 2 stars because it is such a poor transfer. The picture image is very soft. Such a shame...but then that is Warner Brothers who do not seem to take a great deal of care in their work. One of my all time favorite movies....I can't tell you how many times I saw it in the theatre and was thrilled when it came out on VHS a few years ago. But the picture is soft focus....actually gets hard on the eyes. Shame on you Warner Bros.
5,Very entertaining!,"Thumbs up from the whole family. While the movie does show it's age (over 55 years old now), it's still a lot of fun. As others have mentioned, Cantinflas as Passepartout is the centerpiece of the show. But what a centerpiece! It's easy to see why he was so highly regarded in his day. And it's hard to go wrong with David Niven as Phileas Fogg. Shirley MacLaine probably wouldn't have been my choice to play the Indian princess Aouda, but that's not to say she was bad at all. Just a curious choice.The movie isn't totally faithful to the book (hot air balloon, bullfighting) but the changes do not detract from story as far as I'm concerned. And there are plenty of special features.""Around the World..."" is a great three-hour ride. Compared to the Pierce Brosnan and Jackie Chan versions, I'll take this one every time (and I like Brosnan and Chan!). Finally, for the price (currently $9.99), this movie is a steal."
3,Best Picture Oscar ??? Why???,"Around the World in 80 Days (Two-Disc Special Edition)For some reason, maybe because of the names, Phinneas Fogg and Passepartout, I was expecting a funny film. I was sadly disappointed on that score, although there were some somewhat amusing scenes. Basically throughout the first disc, I felt the film's story was a threadbare line on which to hang a sort of travelogue of scenes from various countries along Phinneas' route. The Spanish dance scene and the bull fight were unnecessarily long, as were various other episodes. My interest grew during the second disc, but I am still glad I didn't pay full price for my set. On the whole, I would say I found the film mildly entertainig and it was educational on a cultural level (such as where ostriches were used to pull carts in the Orient). I also felt there was the odd disconnect in the story."
4,Great Movie,"Great Classic movie very enjoyable.It was hard to start kept giving error messages once started worked great ran straight true without problems,"
2,Around the world in 80 days,"Unable to play - wrong zone so sadly not able to comment. A great pity, as I was looking forward to itJP"
2,Episodic Scenic Epic Pales With Time,"Time has been unkind to Around The World In 80 Days-- in more ways than one. A prime example of failure in film preservation, the film can no longer be seen as it originally appeared. This aside, the episodic, leisurely pace of the film is a bit TOO episodic and a bit TOO leisurely to substain the film's running time. A first rate cast and entertaining cameos make the movie worth a watch, but only as a second or a third choice."
5,A film treasure to be enjoyed no matter what the years is ..,"One of the 1950's best films ever this classic books in at a solid 3 hours in length .. Not bad when today's films barely hit 90 minutes and then they do it begrudgingly ...I don't know if you have to be over 50 to enjoy this film since it certainly does have a lot of the hottest stars of the time like Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Jose Greco and so on .. The main start, David Niven and Cantinflas are incredible and of course the number of Oscars won by this film still put's it up there as the best ....The DVD is excellent both the Dolby tacks and the colour video ....Wonderfull ....."
5,The Best History Book,"This is a must for anyone who loves history. Unfortunately, if you were educated in the United States this part of history is left out. It is a must for Americans to read so they can understand how a war could last 622 years. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and keeps your interest level at the top."
5,Texsport Amesbury Arbor (Canopy),"I looked for a replacement canopy for one that I had for the past five years. The Texsport was a little bigger than the one previously owned, but it works perfectly in the patio space. I was surprised at the good quality workmanship of the cover. Better than the old one. It comes with numbered directions. (It does take two persons to put it all together. My husband is 79 and I'm 74 and though it probably took us a little longer to put together, we did it and it looks great. It comes with a zippered bag, so that when it is taken down, you can put all the pieces together in one place. We're very pleased with our purchase and the quick response we had from our Amazon.com purchase. We recommend the product and the service we received. Everything was in good order."
1,Not very useful...,"My wife bought this thing for my birthday. I like the display and the compass (It needs to be recaliberated every once in a while to be accurate) and the voice alerts. Hardly impressed by the radar detection, which of course, is what it's supposed to do. Drove right through a speed trap without a beep from this thing. The promised 360 degree protection is baloney. I have figured out that the radar or the cop car has to be straight ahead for this thing to work. It does beep on almost every automatic door opener I am close to. It is suppsed to alert me of emergency vehicles as well, but it didnt when i was close enough to one. Bad buy and now I am having problems returning it."
5,Cobra 12 band radar/laser detector,It is just amazing. Thats all i have to say about it! Its well worth the GREAT price I got it for.We havent gotten any tickets since we got the radar detector.
4,COBRA RADAR/LAZAR INPUT,THE XRS9830 12 RADAR-LAZAR DETECTOR DOES EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE IN THE BUSY CITY OR ON THE HIWAY. THE FIRST TIME I USED THE DETECTOR IT PICKED UP EMERGENCY VEHICLES EVEN BEFORE I HEARD THE SIRENS. I HAVN'T USED IT ON THE HIWAYS YET BUT AFTER READING ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS I AM SURE IT WILL BE FINE. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE I CAN SEE IS THE COMPASS. IT IS NOT 100% ACCURATE ACCORDING TO THE COMPASS IN MY INFINITY.
2,not what I was looking for,"This item was mirepresented as ""new"" from the seller and was a factory refurbished item. It works somewhat, the compass doesn't know which direction is which. Its actually comical to see the direction change from NE to SE while driving straight on a highway. Avoid seller and product"
1,Waste of $,"Don't spend the money on this item. You don't get the whole article, only a link to a magazine website, which you then have to join if you want to read the article. I didn't bother going that far."
3,"""Send more blood-soaked babes!""","I'm rating this movie at three stars because of audio problems. Volume dips down in some areas, nothing more. Otherwise! I loved this movie! This film is great fun. Don't expect great acting. At best it's below average. But thats okay, it works for this film. Besides there are plenty of blood-soaked babes running and bouncing around to keep you glued to your seat. I loved this movie. I want to see a Stippers VS Zombies II with higher production value!"
1,Just a zombie strippers knock-off,"This is another typical movie with strippers that dance with there cloths on. For a b-movie about strippers, I would have expected more than a couple quick glimpses of flesh. If you bought this movie expecting block-buster quality acting and cinematography, you will be disappointed. As expected it is a typical low-budget b-movie but it is funny at times. I had hoped that they actually wrote some sort of plot but they didn't. The plot is ripped off from ""Zombie Stripper"" with only minor changes. Not sure how they kept from getting sued for the rip-off since it is so very nearly the same exact movie.Low budget movies are what they are. No stars off for that.1-1/2 stars off for a lame ""strippers with cloths"" theme. :(2-1/2 stars off for being a total plagiarized ripoff of the real ""Zombie Strippers"" movie.Save your money and buy the actual ""Zombie Strippers"" movie, at least it has more skin and Jenna Jameson as a lead character! :)"
3,Crack whore zombies,"Okay, but a far less successful effort than the superior Zombies vs Strippers. It has a few momemnts of crude humor and zombie gore, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone beyond fans of the genre."
4,Not for Everyone,"The acting leaves a lot to be desired and the production value and effects are not great. That being said, I still liked this movie a lot. Crack whore zombies fighting strippers with an all-American, good boy hero as the savior is too funny to miss. I loved the pimp, Johnny 'Back-Hand' Vegas, he is hilarious. I know a lot of people will say this movie is stupid but I enjoyed the humor and the zombie horde bearing down on a strip club."
1,Not even bad in a good way,"First off I am a huge zombie movie fan as well as just good ole fashioned low budget films. Therefore, don't think my low rating of this is because I just don't ""get"" this kind of movie. The acting is horrible even for a low budget which you can get passed if there is nice gore and a good nudity-to-bad acting ratio, however, for this film there was not. Drop the cgi special effects and stick with fake blood and common household items. It looks better and can be taken a little more serious. Not to mention the character they tried to make into a Samuel L. Jackson got about as close as being his retarded cousin. If you want good zombie movies look to Romero if you want a decent stripper zombie movie check out Zombie Strippers instead."
1,Do not buy this DVD at any price,I only write reviews on especially very good or very bad products since everyone has their own opinions about individual products. This movie is particularly bad. The movie is not funny; not gory and the women are not very good looking. I purchased the movie as a joke and now realize the joke is on anyone who buys this poorly done DVD.Save your money.
5,To stand the test of time,"For the converted it's a waste of time going on about how Randy Newman is a living American treasure and that in Years to come it will be the Zevons, Waits' Newman's et al. whose music will really be appreciated, simply because it's only music of true quality that can stand the test the time. Here Newman revisits his vast songbook and once again lets me in to his World, and now at his stage of life the songs seem to make more sense than ever - vital, amusing, sardonic, and 4 the unitiated very easy to listen to - but then REALLY listen and welcome to the World of Randy Newman. A 'no risk' disc from one of America's greatest treasures. I just can't wait to consume Volume 2!"
3,My opinion of The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 1,"I am not a huge fan of Randy Newman, and the only song on this album I really loved was Louisiana. I am a little disappointed in the rest of the songs. Maybe I should have bought a different album, but I was influenced by the reviews of those who must be bigger fans of his music, or perhaps if I listen to it more, it will grown on me."
5,Not surprising: simple and wonderful,"I very briefly debated buying this (through iTunes) but I was right to do so.He's taken some of his great tunes and simply replayed them without the elaborate and sometimes distracting production. In some cases he's made very subtle changes, but mostly he's stuck to his original vision.I totally expected to be neutral about this, but hearing him redo Rednecks, or It's Money That I Love is a totally wonderful experience. You may have heard the songs a million times before, and seen him do them in concert, but there's still something very special about this recording."
5,Everything's right,"The balance of styles throughout the album is dead on.This is a rock-synthpop-electronic-trance hybrid in a punk mood.I'm a newbie to Goldfrapp. A friend recommended Felt Mountain, I got Black Cherry instead. I'm sure I made the right choice.Opening track Crystalline Green might be my favorite. But then there's Train, title-track Black Cherry, Tiptoe, super-hot Twist, Strict Machine...The songs on this CD that rock totally rock. The sound is new and cool. Of the slower songs, Black Cherry is the standout. The rest of them sound like St. Etienne, The Cardigans or someone even more obscure. That's not an insult, just an admission that I'm not sure I want to buy Felt Mountain. I do want to hear more Goldfrapp though."
3,Hmmm...,Someone once said to me it takes 30 years to write the first album and approximately few months for the rest albums in someones music career. I really did like Felt mountain even though I found it a bit too polished and I do like black cherry( only a little bit less.). I somehow think that goldfrapp's next cd is going to be even better than these both since they didn't fully explore the electronic sound that they seem to want to experiment with. As far as the lyrics are concerned I do like most of them with few exceptions (sometimes bit fake) But there is one thing for sure that they can definitely create landscapes with their sound from crystaline gardens to decaying hells...(?)My favourite tracks on this album are :1.tiptoe 2.deep honey 3.twist 4.hairy trees...
4,Next Blondie?,"Came on, does anyone here feels a close similarity with Blondie?Well I do, and it seems to me they want to transmit what Blondie did in the 80's: originality, strength and passion."
1,Black Cherry is the Pits,"The promotional review of this album was correct instating that Black Cherry was a departure from Goldfrapp's(successful) style in Felt Mountain. With Felt Moutain,I absolutely fell in love with this band. But, withwith Black Cherry, the love affair is on the skids.Personally, I believe that a band should make at leasttwo albums in the same style when they know that styleworks. Too bad Goldfrapp decided to go astray so early.Black Cherry sounds like it belongs back in the 1980swith all of its primative synth and tinny vocals.As a previous reviewer noted, the sound is reminiscentof what we heard on their ""U.K. Girls"" cover.This will probably please fans of that style. But,for me it was an unwelcome change. I firmly believethat one should give an album three full listeningsbefore rendering judgement. And, after doing so,my copy is headed for the used bins.Goldfrapp, here's hoping you can return to yoursmooth, seductive Felt Mountain weirdness!"
3,Black Cherry,"Since the recent commercialization of track 7, Black Cherry may be on its way to overplay; however, Will Gregory's musical creativity and the sweet, sexy, smooth voice of Alison Goldfrapp, will never lose their splendor."
2,"Geeze, what was this suppose to be?","Talk about derivative, this group (or whatever) steals from everyone. I'm not talking mood or style, but actual riffs of dozens of songs from early Simple Minds to Pink Floyd. You go through this thinking, ""hey, I remember that"". It doesn't help that every song is embellished with bug zapper squawks and all sorts of wee-oh stuff that sounds like a theremin trapped in a garbage disposal with a drum machine working the switch.The pity is that some of the song ideas and the vocal performances are quite engaging. This thing desparately needed a producer strong enough to enforce a unified groove and tell the girl(s?) when to leave out the electronica. Try again, there's talent here."
2,A major disappointment because rather ordinary,"and definitely derivative, but then I guess that's the point. Although I bought this on amazon, I spotted it first in the electronica section of a local music store where the write-up sounded like this was pretty much just a new-age disco album. Anyway, the reviews here tipped me over the edge, indicating as they do, that this is something different and special, but now I have it I gotta say that although this isn't really a disco album it ain't electronica either. The music reminds me of a tame, laid back Donna Summer laid over a beat box and casio keyboard and some electronic sound effects thus the 'electronica' misnomer. It's great if you like pleasant background music with some neat hooks occassionally and the eponymous single is pretty good but it not enough to carry the entire CD. It's more grey cherry than black cherry, in my opinion."
4,Dirty dirty dirty,"I've heard it said that Massive Attack's 'Mezzanine' is the perfect album for sex. Couple 'Mezzanine' with 'Black Cherry' and you've got yourself an all-nighter! OK, now for a real review. 'Black Cherry' took a bit of getting used to. I suppose I was expecting another 'Felt Mountain'. Bad move on my part and I was disappointed. However, there were a couple of songs that kept me coming back - Tiptoe & Crystalline Green. In fact, I found the 'Felt Mountain'ish songs like Hairy Trees to be kind of annoying on this album. After several listens I decided I liked 'Black Cherry'. I find it puts me in a kind of cool, sexy, struttin' mood. Alison's voice really soars on this album, she shows off her chops, but she also whispers, croons and pouts. No whistling. The instrumentals are very pop, electronic and often times VERY 80's - I almost brought out my fluorescent socks and jelly shoes! A child of the 80's New Wave movement will really dig 'Black Cherry'."
4,"Energetic, flourescent and daring-but I prefer Felt Mountain","After listening to this CD, those three words came to mind. I'm a little biased because I was recommended to Goldfrapp's 'Felt Mountain' CD on a music association website, bought the CD and immediately loved it! But I do like this CD, and am still a fan of Goldfrapp. The tracks on this CD are a little bit more erotic, risque, and throbbing with catchy beat sequences like 'Tiptoe', and 'Strict Machine'. Her song 'Twist' has lyrics like ""put your dirty angel face between my legs and knicker lace""...etc. On this CD, I think you will hear a sexier Alison Goldfrapp than the ethereal jazzy one from Felt Mountain. There are a few blissful tracks that will be a treat for Felt Mountain fans-tracks like 'Hairy Trees', 'Forever', and if you buy the Japanese import -'Big black cloud little white lie'... Hope this helps!"
3,Compared to Felt Mountain...,"It's different that's for sure. I won't say it's bad, because if this was Goldfrapp's debut album then I would love it. It's just that Felt Mountain treated me to some of the best songs I've ever heard, and Black Cherry was just so different. I guess my expectations were so high that they could never be attained. At least they haven't done what some artists do and made a carbon copy of their last album, changed the title and slapped a higher price tag on it.The standout song in my opinion are:* Crystalline Green* Black Cherry* The extremely unique Tiptoe* Hairy Trees* And the best song on the album, Train"
5,Sonic Excellence,"This is one of the best CD's I own. If you must compare it to Felt Mountain then think of it as a comparrison between sex on bottom and sex on top, both are great. I don't even want to try and over-think this album because the sheer joy lof listening to something so powerfully transportational cannot be eclisped by fumbling analysis. Listen, just buy the record and if you want you can name your first-born after me as a small way of saying thanks fer the heads up."
4,Bandaids needed again...lol,A great followup to Felt Mountain. Wonderful ear candy. A record you can Feel.Nice one Goldfrapp!!!
4,Intoxicatingly gorgeous...,"Cabaret and electronica are two labels that come to mind when listening to this fine disc. The duo Goldfrapp does an excellent job of combining the two aforementioned labels together. If you haven't listened to this disc yet, well, you are in for a treat! The lead singer's (Alison Goldfrapp) seductive vocals backed by shimmering electronic music, hynoptic drumbeats, and orchestral string arrangements will leave you wanting for more! Sexy doesn't even begin to describe the band's music! There are the dance numbers and then there are the beautiful ballads. Alison sings with much heart and soul. Definitely worth listening to. Now I really want to check out their first release ""Felt Mountain""!"
3,Trip pop,"Although the grimy plasticity which makes up the vast majority of a production aesthetic here is a far cry from the smoothed-out trip hop that brought the name to fame, one cannot deny the effort put into detailing shallow sparkles."
4,Excellent Buy,"I first heard Goldfrapp a month ago on Pandora and noted that various good songs had all been by Allison Goldfrapp. After the sixth or seventh one I found three CD's online with the songs I liked and bought Black Cherry, Supernature and Felt Mountain which are all amazing. Black Cherry and Supernature have high energy songs as well as some sweet, softer melodies while Felt Mountain has more intense, yet oddly mellow songs like Lovely Head, Utopia and Horse Tears. Totally worth the buy."
4,Disciplined lipstick electronic excellence,"There's a form of OCD that must weave its way through the DNA of all electronic trip hop music artists. It's a fusion of shiny black latex and cold chrome that sets the pace and the mood, but never let's you inside.Tracks like ""Strict Machine"" are flawless in their precision and executed with glorious attention to detail. It's an certain and unique art to be able to cunstruct something with the perfect symmetry of Goldfrapp's sound. If you need that restraint, that seamless wall of beauty without warmth, this is a killer album.When its over, you're a little numb, but certain that you got your m oney's worth."
4,aaaahhhh refreshing!,"All I have to say is...Goldfrapp was in much need of a new direction. I just didnt buy the last drama filled ,curtain up, lights down album. It was a bit much. This album is pure entertainment. I hear some prince influence.... and I think, how great would it be if Allison Goldfrapp was the new prince chick. Some of it reminds me of Moloko , era ""things to make and do"". but its still a unique blend of original songs, and creative enough not to be warped in with some of the lamer electroclash albums. Buy this record..... it will evoke strange thoughts and feelings."
1,Cheap junk from China,"These things are pure junk from China. Out of a 10-pack, the sockets of 2 of them were so poorly made that nothing could be plugged into them. The quality is so low that I wouldn't buy them again for 50 cents apiece."
5,Excellent comforter for the price!,"I had a much more expensive down-filled comforter, but I gave it away. This comforter is just the right weight...I'm not too hot and not too cold, but just right. Also, I have had other comforters that were down-filled and the down moved around and made the bed look lumpy. The down alternative is still very soft, but stays put and is much better for my allergies. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
3,Warm and comfy,"This is a very pretty and warm comforter that I use as a bed spread. The only reason it is getting three stars instead of four is because the stitching is starting to come loose; only had this for two months. I do like, however, the alternative to down. Keeps its shape and ticking. Just hope the threads stay in place!"
4,Very Nice,The comforter looks nice and is comfortable. it sheds little white fur balls which gets on the sheets and my clothes.
5,Turn off the heater,"This will allow your body temperature to keep you near perspiration levels. It may look thin out of the bag, but it does a superior job of keeping you warm."
2,Not as Fluffy,"I purchased this king sized down alternative comforter, for my queen sized bed, hoping to get a soft and fluffy feel when I placed in in my duvet cover. Boy was I wrong...the comforter was flat and the appearance I was going for (similar to the look you see in your local department store) was a comforter that would fill the duvet like a soft fluffy cloud. I am pleased that this comforter keeps me fairly warm at night. Well, I guess I can't really complain because the comforter was fairly cheap. You win some and you lose some."
3,Good comforter,"I got the queen sized comforter for my queen bed, but it looks small and my blankets hang down past the edges. I do like the fact it is thin and lightweight."
4,Great Purchase!,"I bought this comforter for my daughter for Christmas. It's really beautiful and soft, and definately looks like it cost more than $50. I bought a duvet cover to go over it, to keep it clean, which also took care of the white fuzzies. It is thin, but my daughter said it keeps her nice and warm. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the weather has been rather mild so far. Will try to update when weather gets colder. Shipping was fast and have never had a problem ordering through Amazon"
2,Hard to get off,They are fine if you put them where you can cover them up easily. Unlike my son who wanted one on his forehead!! It took alot of scrubbing to get the main part of it off. and some of it had to just wear off which took a few days.
2,junky,The comb works poorly. It is not well put together. I doubt it will last long before it falls apart.
5,Helped Me!,"I purchased this book along with HH Chemistry, Physics, & Biology to prepare for the TExES Teacher Content tests. The book is easy to read, has section review questions and chapter review questions with answers (plus explanations of answers- correct & incorrect.) I passed the test!"
5,Homework Helpers Earth Science,I wanted an Earth Science book that was on a high school-college level but was easy enough for my 12 year old homeschooler to understand and not be bored to death or overwhelmed by the content. She likes the whole homework helpers science series including this one.
5,Earth Science Praxis,This book is broken down into easy sections that include reviews to help the reader practice. i also loved the end of chapter exams. I used this book to help prepare for the Praxis Earth and Space Science exam.
4,Raphael Soriano,"Of all the important pioneers of modern architecture in southern California, Soriano was one of the most inventive and idealistic, but least successful. If he hadn't won the attention of Julius Shulman--as a photographer and client--he would probably be forgotten, so few are the surviving traces of his modest mid-century output. When he died, in 1988, poor and embittered, few took note. This self-inflicted failure (Soriano alienated Entenza, Eichler and several other key clients) challenged Wolfgang Wagener, an architect who practices here and in Germany, to reevaluate his achievement and develop a complete list of buildings and projects. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
2,Died three months after warranty expired!,"I was very happy with this microwave until it suddenly stopped working barely four months after the warranty expired (one year, three months and twenty-eight days after purchase). It worked great during that time, but for a hundred dollars I assumed it would last a little longer than it did."
4,Good product,"I was a bit skeptical about buying a microwave off amazon, but these worries were quickly dissipated when I received the product:Pros:1- The microwave is big and easily fits almost anything you want to heat2- The microwave is very powerful and could be used for cooking, and being a single guy I use microwave to cook more frequently than I would like to3- The microwave is more or less easy to operate and the user manual is very understandableCons:1- The microwave is a bit noisy when operating2- The microwave has no cover for the food inside it (the usual plastic dome that comes with other microwave ovens)3- Not sure it's a pro or con, it is rather a big object and occupies a lot of space on the kitchen counterAll in all this is a good product, the pros are more important than the cons"
1,Potpourri Spirituality,"I believe this world must be running fast to the end of its life as I see these days everybody is talking about spirituality even though they don't seem to know what the spirituality really is. Ms. Borysenko is surely one of many so-called spiritual gurus who have no substance at all but talking. Just like the other self-annointed false prophets, she cherry-picked good stuff from all of major religions in the world, blended them with psycology and tried to turn them into her own spirituality. However, she failed since I didn't see any originality or creativity in her presentation. I want to call this 'potpourri spirituality' that smells good but has no real vibrant living things in it. I gave the one star becasue that is the lowest point I can give."
5,Transporting reportage.,"Marvelously paced nonfiction. Tayman's portrait of the internees' plight is affecting and humanizing. An arresting account, poignantly told, of an underreported period of Hawaiian history. A breakthrough work."
1,The Colony book reivew,The Colony by John Tayman covers an interesting topic about the hardships faced by the exiles of Molokai but does so in a humdrum way. The first few chapters were mediocre at best and only got worse as the book went on. Having to finish the book soon became a daunting task that I didn't look forward to doing. This book was far from engaging and was tough to read for more than several pages at a time without getting bored. It was also very choppy making it a difficult read. I would not recommend this book.
2,Poorly edited...,"I found the writing of this book mediocre and the editing poor. There are many unclear passages where the author will say something like ""10 people were diagnosed... all eight died..."" Or ""Four men were killed...the three bodies were buried..."" Very annoying. And don't get me started on his requent use of word SNUCK, which makes my blood run cold. I found the latter chapters of the book to be full of minutiae of the lives of a few older residents, that was of little interest or poinancy. Seemed like filler. Overall, the topic is very interesting, and parts are well-rendered, but the writing is somewhat jerky and overwrought."
5,An Account of History Worth Reading,"As a resident of Hawaii, and a former 18-year veteran photojournalist for TIME Magazine, It was good to read a credible, dignified and respectful profile of the residents-former and current-of Kalaupapa. I've visited Molokai often, and have read many articles about the former colony, but Tayman's book told me things I never knew. He connected the extraordinary stories in a way that made the narrative as riveting and as inspirational as a well-crafted movie. This is an exciting book and a must read for anyone interested in the history of Kalaupapa."
1,Fraught with Inaccuracies,"The inaccuracies start with the cover. The picture is not of the cliffs of Moloka`i but the Amalfi Coast of Italy. The use of the word ""true"" in the title is an insult to the remaining residents of Kalaupapa.I am fortunate to know some of the individuals interviewed in this book. When they were shown the proofs, they attempted to correct the misinformation both about their lives and the history of Kalaupapa. Their attempts were rebuffed.See the NY Times article of 3/27/06 entitled ""Book on Leprosy Settlement Draws Fire"" for more details."
3,Interesting Book,I can really feel Hawaii and maybe my life is not so bad since I am not a 19th century leper.
1,Not Endorsed,"The author's own note reflects a lack of credibility and respect for those he writes about extensively in this book. He writes on page 319: ""To my regret, both (two of the remaining survivors) declined to participate further in the project, and asked to be left out of the book. While I've attempted to be responsive to their concerns, I recognize that they do not agree with the editorial decisions I have made and they do not endorse the book.""For greater historical accuracy and correct context to the quotes used in this book, I recommend: Holy Man: Father Damien by Daws, Pilgrimage and Exile: Mother Marianne by Hanley, Olivia: My Life in Exile by Breitha, and audio books of stories told by Makia Malo."
2,"Informative, But Dull","Just can't seem to develop a real interest in this one. The information is provided in a long drawn out manner. The story is one the world should know more about, but can we condemn people for doing what seemed, at the time, necessary to protect the rest of society? The author records the information he has in rather a dull manner. Nothing springs to live. The reader becomes an observer of life on the island, not really caring about it, but feeling guilty because of what happened. One thing of particular interest was learning that there were no lepers in the Bible - only people with skin diseases."
1,"Dry, Confusing and Bungled Account of a Great Story.","This book reads like one of the wandering pathways the author notes in his book...it seems to ramble on forever, all the time you are wishing you were at the end of it. The story itself is fascinating subject matter, but the author unfortunately leaves many loose ends, delves only shallowly into the characters' lives, and seems to have a bias for white male characters so much so as to make us all wonder if there were actually any women or people of Hawaiian heritage in this colony worth more than a footnote (I'm sure there were!). Were it not for the curiosity in me on the subject matter, I would have tossed this one aside after page 10. Perhaps when (if!) I ever finish it, I will change my mind, but now half-way through it, I think the verdict is in: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
5,Harrowing but beautiful,"Tayman's account of the leper colony on Molokai and its history is fascinating and brilliantly written.He clearly shows us the various characters involved over a century of ""medical segregation"" as he calls it. All in all many scholars have come to the conclusion that the isolation of the lepers prevented the further progress of the disease in Hawaii.The poor planning by the Board of Health made the victim's suffering more acute in the beginning of their isolation and the effects of this have lived on in the hearts of the Hawaiian people."
5,"A Powerful, Poignant Account","Some time ago I mistakenly picked up the novel ""Molokai,"" believing it to be a non-fiction account of the leper colony on that island. Although it was a fine novel, I kept wanting to learn about the real people associated with this real place, including some I had read about in piecemeal fashion: Father Damien, Mother Marianne Cope, Robert Louis Stevenson, and so on. Well, The Colony is the answer to that wish. I read it in two sittings, over a short weekend. It is fast-paced, amazingly well-researched, and written with little to no sensationalism. There is some very frightening stuff in here, to be sure, but also some very inspiring things as well. It reminded me, in some ways, of ""The Devil in the White City,"" and fans of that book well surely like this one. (In fact, there's a short episode in ""The Colony"" that takes place at the Chicago World's Fair.) I've pressed this book on several of my friends already, and it will be the next selection of my book club."
1,Sensationalism sells but the truth doesn't.,"Why would the author of a ""complete history"" and a ""work of non-fiction"" on the history of Kalaupapa use a doctored photograph of the Amalfi Coast of Italy as its cover? The choice of this photo sends the message that the cliffs of Molokai are not ""harrowing"" enough to fit the story that Mr. Tayman has chosen to tell. Unfortunately, this book is more like a novel ""based on true events"" than a true history of this most treasured place that was designated a National Historical Park in 1980 for the education and inspiration of present and future generations.The cover, as well as one-sided sensational descriptions of the early residents that have little to do with reality, led one talk show to comment:"" . . . Hawaii may make you think of swaying palms and beautiful weather, but this one desolate spot on Molokai seems more like King Kong's Skull Island."" http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail975.htmlNothing could be further from the truth."
5,The Hawaii No One Knows (Or Talks About),"I've been to Kalaupapa twice, once with relatives and once with a group of tourists. It is a beautiful, and haunting, and moving place. But I wish the tour guide had passed out this book beforehand, because I would have never known the whole story of this notorious leper colony -- or the amazing people who were exiled to it. If you want to be inspired, outraged, and fully entertained, by all means buy this book. A big, big thumbs up."
2,tooo long,"A very detailed and exhaustive treatment of the happenings at Moloki from about 1860 to the present. It is also very exhausting to read. There are over 400 pages of who was there, what the settlement was like, what they did, who were the leaders, etc. Half that amount would have been plenty to get the ideas across."
1,Insulting to the truth.,"As a former resident of Molokai, and one who had multiple opportunities to minister to the people of Kaulapapa, I am appalled at this work of fiction being considered history. It would be one thing for the author to mention that this is his own delusion based on some true events, but to pass this off as a legitimate history is criminal."
5,Even Better Than Described!,"Several weeks ago I was back east on business and heard the author being interviewed by, of all people, Joan Rivers. Given the subject matter of the book--a leper colony--I anticipated a barrage of bad jokes and plastic surgery comments. Well I was stunned at how thoughtful and sensitive Joan Rivers was during the interview. (Later I Googled her and discovered she has a sociology degree from Barnard.) It was obvious that Rivers loved the book, and was touched and haunted by the stories of the people of this colony. It was a great interview, and so when I got home I bought a copy. Well, Joan was right--this is a powerful, beautiful, tragic book. I read that it has been sold to Hollywood, and I hope the movie that is being made is half as inspiring as the book. If so, it'll be a blockbuster."
1,Misleading and Innacurate,"Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Hawaiian history and the history of Kalawao/Kalaupapa will see immediately the flaws in this piece of ""non-fiction."" Amazing how one author can rely upon inaccurate news accounts and quote people and writers out of context to sensationalize a story which needed not one iota of sensationalism. Shameful and offensive to many of those still living in Kalaupapa. Read the fiction ""Moloka'i"" by Alan Brennert for a more realistic (and more historically accurate) view of this important piece of world history."
5,another very good CRKT knife,"An excellent value fot $17.95. When I heard that it was discontinued, I ordered one. This is a tactical knife. The grip is 3/4 inch wide and is very comfortable and secure. The blade is listed as 3 3/4, but I'd call it 3 1/2 to the stud. Well made, very solid 6.2 ounces. It flips right out and snaps in securely. I like the LAWKS system for extra safety. (Lake And Walker Knife Safety). I got it for backpacking because my son's boyscout patrol doesn't allow fixed blades, but I carry it sometimes. kind of a tank, so it's not EDC. Slightly longer handle and blade than a CRKT Fire Spark, but much wider handle. Flips out as easily as a CRKT Shenanigan. I love it."
1,A DESECRATION OF A MASTERPIECE,"Ditto the two reviewers above. I just this moment finished viewing this mess, and though I am still reeling from the beauty of the music, I cannot forgive the production. The first act ensemble staging antics were embarrassing to watch. The second act was a jumbled mess. What was with the intoxicated singer in male drag? The third act was almost passable until the final moments when Manon became a murderess at the last moment!! And the last act was so flawed I don't even want to open that can of worms or I'll be here writing all night, and I have much better things to do. One other thing, I think our other two reviewers were much to kind as to the singing abilities of Des Grieux. His ""money"" notes for me were actually painful. They were unsupported and almost shouted. I still have a bit of a sore throat after hearing them.I don't mean to be mean spirited - but, come on!! This, to me, is Puccini's masterpiece. To see it so boldly desecrated infuriates me."
1,I want my money back!!!,"The previous reviewer has said it all, but in a much kinder way. This is a terrible perversion of Manon Lescaut. I can't think of anything as bad, except that awful M/22 Seraglio, but at least that was well staged and sung!!! I thought Astrid Weber was barely competent as a singer and a horrible actress. She displayed no innocence from the outset. On her way to a convent? Oh, come on! Geronte was played by Kouta Rasanen, who looks like he's barely old enough to vote. Zurab Zurabishvili, Des Grieux, would be okay as a concert singer, but his acting skills are poor. No one in the cast was the least bit likeable. The updated staging made the whole thing even more absurd. Does France still ship her harlots to Louisiana?The only good thing I can say about this production is that Puccini's music was still excellent."
4,"Unique Soul Jazz, Ahead of it's time","This isn't the best early Pat Martino album. but it's very good and worthwhile for Martino fans. It's has a 12 string guitar, electric bass, drums, fender rhodes line up with sax on one or two songs also. The 12 string gives it a somewhat chorusy sound, but he still does some amazing runs. The sound is unique. The tunes and arrangements have a 60's soul jazz sound. It reminds me of 80's 90's John Scofield at times. It really swings and the sax player is really fantastic on the tunes he's on. My favorite early album is ""Strings!"" but this is very good and enjoyable."
3,Thick 12 string Jazz guitar playing on all pistons,"I don't know if McLaughlin influenced this guy or he influenced McLaughlin and Larry Coryell or it was a mutual influence or what, all these cats living in and around the New York scene at the time, but aside from McLaughlin and Coryell, Martino is the fastest, most technically adept Jazz guitar player of this late '60s period. Imagine someone with the technique of what Mike Stern has today back in 1969 playing on a 12 string with a somewhat funky band that is just about to enter fusion territory but is still very much in the Miles Davis ""Files de Kilimanjaro"" mode rather than ""Bitches Brew,"" and you have yourself a good picture of what ""Desperado"" is all about. The two most smokin' tunes ""BlackJack,"" and ""Oleo"" are ABSOLUTE MUSTS in any jazz guitar afficionado's collection, they are flat-out classics, and the moody, progressive title track points the way to a more mellow Jazz-rock sound that Martino was to perfect in the '70s."
5,Heartbreaking,"VERY painful read. Living in SW Missouri, where there are burned out meth houses in every block in the poorer areas of our community, I found this book to be very realistic. WARNING: NOT for younger readers. Don't give it to your 10-year-old."
2,BORING,"I have enjoyed numerous Sarton titles, but unfortunately I didn't get beyond page 175 of this one. I couldn't relate to any of the characters: unlikable, dated, boring and cold. Maybe it's difficult not to write a cold book about cold people. And the love affair! Not very believable. Try ""The Small Room"" instead."
4,"Finally,A Diverse collection of artist!","This collection of artist is one of the best yet! It features two New African-American artist, Belasco from Los Angeles,and myself,David Barnes from Washington,DC."
4,"I love ""Camili-Cat'!","Though the gay erotic comic stories in Meatmen 25 run the gamut from so-so to excellent, my favorite strip is ""Camili-Cat and the Djinns"" by Canadian artist Patrick Fillion. Camili-Cat, a slim and muscular, humanoid feline, has all kinds of inter-species (but gay) sex with a variety of aliens, monsters and other intergalactic beings. Though the concept might be disgusting if done by an inferior artist, Fillion manages to make his Camili-Cat stories both visually appealing and highly erotic! This is the first Camili-Cat story to appear in English and in the United States, but hopefully it won't be the last. Please, Mr. Leyland, we want more Camili-Cat!"
2,Was waivering between one and two stars,"Overpriced and poorly made. As others said the story line is poor, the graphics are poor, the sound is poor and it really doesn't do a good job in teaching Spanish.I'm bilingual and have done a better job by speaking to my son on our drives to and from preschool. Save your money and instead buy the ""Atencion Atencion"" DVDs and music, they at least focus on what kids are interested in it. My son got more out of watching an hour of Atencion Atencion (I overheard him counting from 1 - 5 in Spanish) than weeks of Muzzy. Wish I would have returned it. I was a sucker and bought the two packages.DON'T.My son did get a tiny bit out of it, but not enough to make it worth the cost."
3,Decent,"The Spanish is hard to understand at times, but when I noticed it was't clear I repeated the word and sometimes definition while watching it with my children. I know some Spanish and that helped. The animation is decent, not at all as terrible as some say. My children liked it because they are used to only watching limited television and only select shows. I can see how the story would be boring for a child who is used to watching a lot of television for entertainment. It is defiantly not worth the price of $200 new. I found a copy at the public library and was thrilled. Check out your local library or look into buying it used. I am also not too fond of the story line, but i watched it with my girls and answered any questions and gave guidance. It is a good way to introduce your child to a language in a fun and effective way."
1,One of the top private schools in the country uses this program,"so I thought it has to be good! I ordered it...tried to listen to with my son and we were both very disappointed. One it teaches very little French only a handfull of words, phrases but the quality is so poor. The images are horrible and cartoons were better done 70 years ago. The sound was the worse. If you were able to make out the sound to hear what they were saying you were lucky. We sent it back and our using our library on line with a program that they have and are now learning it for free and joined a French Club. My son is now excited about learning French and enjoying it. I would not recommened this muzzy program for anyone. There are simply NO advantages to the program."
1,Awful DVD,"We purchased this DVD set to assist in teaching myself and my toddler a second language since my husband speaks french. The audio in this DVD is very poor quality! You can't understand anything Muzzy is saying. The cartoon is very outdated. I had to make three phone calls to the company before I finally was able to speak with someone in order to return the product. The representative said okay, just return it. I had to ask her if she was interested in why I wanted to return the product. She said several people have complained it is outdated, obviously they are not interested in changing it.DO NOT waste your money on this product!!!"
2,Good luck my friends,"Here's the first thing ill say to you. will any book on fitting in with a certain culture/ethnicity guarantee success or that your relationship will work? of course not. y ou can learn these things on jewish culture on wikipedia and the internet or better yet, read the Torah or Halakh, or talk to jewish friends. Jewish people, like many of us are complex and clannish, neurotic and humorous,they have their degrees of Jewishness, which you can never understand. hang out with them and you realize you don't get the jokes or that you are being judged for not being Jewish, even if you convert. The Jewish person i was involved with wasn't even religious, and with that evergrowing population of 35+ single jews, it makes you wonder if they even know what they are looking for. this is a good book if your'e just too l azy to get on the internet and do a little research, but remember, people are people, outside of Judaism you have to know your partner."
1,A perversion of Jewish values,"So let me get this straight, the author is trying to strengthen the Jewish faith by... making it even easier to marry out. It doesn't take much of a Yiddishe Kop to work out that anything aiding the destruction of Judaism cannot be expressing it truthfully. I am sure that this book might help some intermarried people deal with their issues, but the approach and normative tone of this book is so at odds with its content that it almost renders it null.As the product of an intermarriage, I can tell you that it is far better to for a non-jewish spouse to learn honestly about Judaism from an authentic source than from one which attempts to legitimise a less-than-ideal situation. In that vein I would reccommend something like Hayim Halevy Donin's 'To Be A Jew'.Perhaps the author should have written a companion volume: Celebrating Christmas with your Grandchildren: Everything an Assimilated Jew Needs to Know, from Jesus to Midnight Mass."
5,First hand experience,"I may be slightly biased (being married to co-author, Jennifer), but I found this book hard to put down. Its practical insight to numerous everyday topics has spurred many a discussion between us. And my newfound familiarity with Jewish traditions has undoubtedly strengthened our relationship. Feeling like I've contributed to the end product to some extent, I'd like to congratulate the girls on compiling and sharing this useful collection of facts and light-hearted accounts. I'll continue to refer to it often."
1,Degrading to Jews and Christians alike,"Trivalizes Judaism & insults non-Jews by creating a ""do you pass the test"" mentality with the reader. It's very disturbing to read reviews from others saying they knew little about Judaism before reading this book and now feel like they've had the ""perfect"" introduction. Sad. The authors should be ashamed."
1,vikki an and jennifer should stick to making matzah ballsls,"Interfaith dating and "" marriage"" have profund theological implications from a jewish perspective as well as for some other religions. Also when one looks at the demographics, particularly the expressed religious affiliation of the grand-children of interfaith couples, it shows a massive defection from judaism.Some studies have shown a loss of as much of 1,000,000 in jewish numbers in recent years. By trivalizing the issue of interfaith dating/marriage the authors show a complete lack of understanding of what Jewish marriage means. Even worse, they help to mislead others which. I hope the authors and others who are considering this book will care enough to find out what being Jewish and what jewish marriage really menas."
5,"hilarious, insightful and a must read","i love everything about this book. the format, the pacing, the information, the great jokes and the wonderful anecdotes.even if you are NOT dating a jew, it is fun reading and hard to put down.a must have for any book collection."
3,Great Compilation,"I was impressed with the movie ""A love song for Bobby Long"" and while viewing the movie I was moved by the soundtrack. The music is mellow and relaxing. You feel you are in New Orleans. Great compilation."
1,NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,I ordered this cd in good faith of it being delivered ...it has never arrived..after numerous e-mails to the company they refuse to respond..I recently read some other complaints about WORLDWIDE and they are all the same...they never ship any items...I hope that AMAZON removes them from the VENDOR LIST....THEY ARE A RIP-OFF COMPANY
2,"Second song is good, the rest of them nothing to write home about...","I was dissapointed in this soundtrack. I thought it was going to be great as I love the bluesy southern stuff, but the songs were all really short and contained no depth at all. I did however enjoy the second song on the CD, something like ""My Heart is a Lonely Hunter""."
1,Repeated manufacturing defects,"After three failed attempts at getting this disc to play in any of my CD players, I'm calling it a day with this title. None were even be recognized as a CD in my computer, my stereo, or my work computer. Rhino, I don't know if you're using some crazy copy-protection scheme, or just need to work on your quality control... but this is a complete fail. I buy dozens of CDs, new and used, every month. Haven't had a single bad one in years, and you just sent me three defective ones in a row."
3,"hope it's not a ""nonfiction"" novel","Richie is a brilliant observer of Japan. His ""Japanese Cinema"" is essential. And he provides insights to a disappearing small town culture. But a lot of this book is dialogue between Richie and locals. Is it accurate? Paraphrase? Did he really ""almost"" have sex w/a Japanese provincial girl? Is their dialogue real or made up? A few years before this book was published, Truman Capote gathered facts about a Kansas murder scene, interviewed the killers, then ""recreated"" the narrative. ""In Cold Blood"" was the first ""nonfiction novel."" Facts plus made up dialogue. I suspect that is what this book is."
4,A 10 star book but...,"I really could not praise this book enough. It is one of my favorite books of all time and a truly astounding piece of ""travel writing"". However, this edition is a bit wanting.The new afterward is very good but a bit sobering, confirming that, yes, to a large extent the place you have just read about is now dead as the dodo, all too effectively ending your ""fever dream"". Also, the new pictures are junk. They look as though they came from a Lonely Planet guide, whilst the original edition had beautiful, mysterious, haunting, high contrast photos that came across more like paintings.Most puzzling is the page layout which consists of 2 columns per page, like a magazine article. Why? So it looks like something from ""Outside"" or GQ? Needless to say I preferred the musty tome from the library that read like some brilliant forgotten diary."
5,Brilliant Travelogue Capturing a Picture of a Departed Japan,"Without a doubt, Donald Richie is the foremost Western interpreter of Japanese culture and society. In this reprinting, updated with an afterword, of Richie's travel around the Inland Sea more than 30 years ago, he has captured a world that was then disappearing and now almost gone. This reviewer is, admittedly, not a huge fan of travelogues. However, Richie's prose flows beautifully. The reader is able to see through his eyes and experience the isolated islands of the Inland Sea. Although there are some photographs, one does yearn for more. The map of Richie's journey is printed across 2 pages, and there is a bit lost in the middle. Nevertheless, these are minor problems. This book provides a glimpse and an insight to a part of Japan that was rarely viewed by Western eyes and it is almost too late to see the remnants."
1,Rambling,This book is a long rambling inner monologue with little plot. I did not enjoy it and in fact couldn't bring myself to finish it.Skip it.
5,"Great storage for your ""special"" cd's!","Well designed storage unit! I use it for storing my ""gold"" cd's. The ""pop-out"" feature is nice, keeping the other cd's unaffected. Also the self-adheasive rubber feet keep the unit in place on slick surfaces. Make sure you have enough storage space with the the 50 unit model. I quickley filled it up and had to order another 50 CD unit to expand with! Each will interlock with the other. A 100 CD unit is also available."
2,Allsop Expandable CD Organizer (50-Disc),"I guess I was expecting something more sturdy & attractive. Storing CDs can be such a pain, & this system is not the solution I sought. I'm too lazy to repack & return this item (I bought 2!) But I'll have to keep looking for a decent piece of furniture to store 3-400 CDs in Jewel Box. I do NOT recommend this item!"
1,Clinical Aspects of Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination- Psychological Consequences and Treatment Interventions- G. Asha,"This item is a summary of the book written by Dr. Sharon Ann Lenhart. It is available on line for free, so save your money. It is a travesty for Amazon to sink so low to charge for this, especially $5.95. J. Wagner"
4,Fresh Perspective on Nation/State building,"The Saud family is the monarchy, which is the state, of Saudi Arabia. This book shows how that state of affairs came to be.I found the material on the 1930s especially illuminating, because it provides us with a picture of the Saud family, and to a degree a picture of Arabia, before the rest of the world came to appreciate the strategic significance of petroleum, and before the Second World War made all national boundaries something up for negotiation and renegotiation.We're also treated to an illuminating dicussion of when marriages (and by extension polygamy) is, and when it isn't, a valuable tool for the forging of political alliances. This is an analytical take on a subject usually rushed through with cliches."
3,Bummer,I was really looking forward to showing this to my class as a supplement to our Natural Disasters unit. Unfortunately there are swear words! :/ WHY?
5,Nat'l geographic classics natural disasters,"If you like disaster movies you'll like this Nat'l Geographic Classics. Watch all the action while setting in you home safely, get blown away by the power of water,snow and deadly winds.If you enjoy seeing what Mother Nature can do.Then get this DVD from Amazon."
5,My 2 year old loves this book!!,"Mouse Mess is a fun and interesting book to read to my 2 year old son. We both enjoy this story! The bright pictures and easy concept hold his attention as a ""just before bedtime story."" The book is rated for 4 to 8 year olds but I think the book is a great beginning reader for young pre-school children!"
3,"For under 2 years, its great","Too simple and too MUCH short to entertain a 2 year 4 month old boy who LOVES books... he read it maybe 4 times and is now bored with it...was a bit disappointed since I ordered on the basis of everyone else's recommendations - giving it to my nephew whose a year old... solid graphics, what you see on the cover is what you get, that would be appealing to younger than 2.5 crowd."
5,We loved it so much we need a new copy!,"We found this book at a school book fair about 2 years ago for my daughter who was 2 at the time. She loved it so much that our soft cover copy is in tatters and I need to get a new hardcover one. I had a broken leg a few months after we got the book and so she would have to go and get her own book and bring it to me to read. This was the only one she brought for weeks at a time. We could hear her reciting it to herself sometimes in bed at night, or when she was taking a bath, just about all the time. We don't know anyone else who knows about this book, but it is so wonderful and fanciful that all my 5 kids just love it. The pictures are full of color, the idea is mischevious, and the text is simply put without being simple. I highly recommend it."
5,Mouse Mess fan,"My son,Sam (13 months), loves this book. We have to read it 3-4 times before he goes down for a nap. The colorful illustrations and sing-song nature of the verses keep his attention and soothe him to sleep."
4,Mouse Mess. meh.,"My 3 year old likes to read this book during snack time with her friends in preschool, so we bought a hardback copy for her teacher as a gift. I find the book boring and kind of dumb, but I'm not 3 years old. She finds it delightful, and so do the 5 other kids in her class."
3,A favorite in our home for a decade!,"Both of my boys have labeled this one a winner over a decade a part. Mouse Mess is a delightful simple story about a mouse destroying this house. The bold and vibrant illustrations are captivating . The easy to read story inspires lots of participation and giggles. In the end the mouse says ""These people need to clean this house"" my preschooler thinks that is the funniest.I think we will keep this one on our shelf for years to come. As delighted as my boys have been with it."
1,I never received my book,"I wrote to the seller 3 different times when it was close to the receive date and I hadn't received a ""it shipped"" date yet. I needed to know when it would ship because I needed it for a college class. I never received a response. The email box was full. I was unable to cancel. I ended up calling my credit card company and cancelling this order. Extremely disappointed with this seller."
2,Realistic Drawing by Carrie Parks,This is a great book! Once I get all I can out of this book I am going to purchase her other books. I am amazed at the improvement in my own drawing from just a little interaction with her book and techniques. This is for anyone who is interested in improving their drawing! Don't think you can't draw...you can!!
4,One of the best but........,"Carrie Stuart Parks writes the best books on drawing that I've ever run across. She breaks it down and makes it easy to understand and I would recommend her books to anyone regardless of skill level. Everyone can learn from her books, all you have to do is be willing to invest the time, and she makes it fun. The only reason this book got 4 stars is due to the fact the step by step projects in the back were a bit of a dissapointment, not because of subject matter, but because the reference photos you are to use are so small, unless you enlarge them on a copier or computer they are very difficult to draw from. However, that being said, DO NOT let this stop you from buying this book, it is well worth the price and there is a lot of good info in it. I would also suggest her portrait book as well of all the books I have in my library of drawing, this is the one I go back to everytime."
5,Best Book ever for Learning Realistic Sketches,"I have been drawing for years, most friends and family know me for my Artistic Drawings. I always thought How could anyone teach me More or Even Better ways to Draw Realistic. I was wrong, this Book was Great, it showed me new ways to look at things and see how it should be on Paper. Even when i am just playing around my Sketches Look Real. The Book explains in very easy directions, and a great step by step. I would get for a kid wanting to learn how to draw, or Even an Adult just wanting to Improve there Artistic abilites."
4,"""preventive only""","Since I have been going more towards organic consumption, tea, veggies, milk, snacks, I decided that my daily supplements needed to be organic as well. I only take this product as a preventive measure. Prostate cancer runs in my family, so I felt it would be a good idea to address this. The directions say to take 4 capsules a day, but I only take 2. I fully researched Saw Palmetto and talked with my doctor before taking it. After two years on a daily basis, no side effects. To your health and a happy prostate."
3,Not my favourite Kipper book.,"We borrowed this one from the library. In this book, Tiger has a new torch (flashlight, for the non-Brits). He wants to try it out so Kipper and Tiger go for a camp-out in the woods. They are attempting to read a ""scary"" story, but then they hear a loud ""SCREECH"" in the woods. The noise is not explained in the book, although the pair guess that it must have been an owl that made the noise. Next a shadow appears on the tent wall. It turns out to be a snail - not scary at all! Finally, the two friends return home and read the book inside the house. Even though this book has a ""safe"" ending, the screech noise, ""scary"" book, and shadow on the tent wall did not make this a book that my 3 year old wanted to read again and again. Instead, after one or two readings, it sat on the table, unopened, until it was returned to the library. This is not one that I, personally, would buy."
3,Needs to be updated,"This was an excellent book at the time it was written, but needs to be updated for the more recent versions of SAS and for changes of terminology usage prompted by relational data bases."
3,Disappointing but not that bad,"I agree with the previous reviewer on that this book is somewhat disappointing for professional SAS programmers - not very many ""secrets"" has been revealed actually. It didn't even explain clearly the key SAS programming concept of ""Program Data Vector"" while it claims to demonstrate how SAS engine works behind the scene. The new version is no much different from the old one but appending a SAS6.10 update list (like ""what's new""). I suspect either the authors or the publisher or both didn't put much work on this new version - that's very un-professional! However, considering the sad fact that there's somehow few good SAS programming book out there, this classic one deserves some respect in SAS community. I read it 2 years ago and I found sometimes I still look it up as a reference on some topics - for the material it covers, it's rather solid."
2,this book is a turkey,"In stark contrast to the title, this book is NOT for professionals, at least not professional programmers, and certainly not for anyone who wishes to become a professional SAS programmer. Any secrets in this book are destined to remain secrets of the authors after the reader has read them. Consider, for example, the half page on transporting files between computers. The only ""secret"" revealed is that it can be done, but not a word is said as to how. Finally, the 6.08-6.10 ""update"" is a very brief, uninformative appendix. The book is really about Release 6.06 and before, i.e. it is seriously out of date, despite its recent publication date. This book might possibly be slightly useful to managers who need to write technobabble about why they are advocating the use of SAS as a data management environment. It will be of negligeable value to anyone who will actually be called upon to accomplish serious work using the SAS language."
3,How can such a great book be so bad?,"Like other reviewers, I believe that the first half of thisbook was fabulous, and the second half terrible. The ocean voyage wasmagical, and the game of not letting Lousie see Charles was downright erotic... Charles was great. He was both sensitive and masculine, and could call up either side of his nature when the moment dictated it...Louise was merely pompous and annoying on the boat until she fell for her pasha. Then she was sweet, giving, and fun (her blindfold made of knickers was a smashing touch). On land, she was a horror--vain, childish, selfish, self-absorbed, deceitful and cold. She completely ruined the book.I recommend checking this book out of a library, or buying it at a used bookstore or auction. Read the first half--then skip to the end. You'll be much happier with it."
1,So disapointing !,"I didn't like that the hero, to put a joke on the heroin, seduces her while disguising himself as another man.Or that the heroin, because she doesn't know her fiancé and she thinks him ugly, finds normal to have an affair with a stranger, thinking that she doesn't have to be faithful or respectful of someone she doesn't know.If I accept flawed characters easily, because perfect personality would be boring, these are not mentalities I want to find in a romance, and I couldn't believe these two would be happy together for more than a few years (or months?)."
1,0 stars if I could...,"... I have rarely disliked a heroine as much as Louise, a much sought after beauty, who must go off to Europe and marry a disfigured, famously ugly Charles. I thought it was sort of creepy to fool Louise by always being in the dark. ... And, again, I found nothing likeable about Louise. Perhaps a romance with an 18 year old girl who really behaves more like a 14 year old was a bit immature for me. After all, I am 31 years old..."
1,Awful romance novel,"I've only read one other Judith Ivory book, and BEAST will be my last. Unbearably shallow characters, thrown-together historical backgrounds, pointless plots that circle around endlessly because characters refuse to clear the air with each other -- UGH. All the things I hate in a romance novel. And I've inflicted this myself, twice.And the main characters in BEAST -- Charles d'Harcourt and Louise Vandermeer -- are awful, he being a vain scuzball who's bedding another woman in the opening chapters, and she being a shallow little twit with pouty lips and curvy figure...and, that's about it."
2,Whatever happend to Judy Cuevas,"I found this novel somewhat lacking. It seemed to be missing the beautiful prose found in her books written under the name of Judy Cuevas. Furthermore, I did not find the characters in this book attractive. It seams all of Night/Cuevas' characters are flawed, yet I usually find this endearing. These characters, however are not very endearing, nor memorable. Perhaps, it is the lack of careful self analysis that is found in some of here other books, such as Dance and Black Silk."
2,Strong start very weak finish,"I found the scenes on board ship very good, I thought that Charles and Louise would have some explosive interaction once they reached land. However, he turned into a wimp and she never got over herself. They had promise, but they didn't deliver."
3,"Loved the beginning, but then...","it started to go downhill from there, slightly rising a bit at the end!I completely agree w/ the customer from Marlboro, Mass. I could not put this book down the entire time the main characters were on the ship, but once they reached land, I found it to be somewhat frustrating. For example the young man on the ""tour"". There could have been more to him, or even bringing the young man into the storyline more deeply.I did enjoy this book, however I thought it could have been more than what it was toward the end. A lot more!"
4,NO MORE CASH TO CARRY,"CASH AND CARRY (1937) - For once in a few times, the boys actually show off their tenderhearted side in the scenes when they're helping out the crippled boy, Jimmy. While it's interesting, it seems very out of character for the Stooges. But fortunately, they go right back to being their manic selves when digging for gold in the old house. Overall, although not a very funny short, it is interesting to see the boys acting this way. Even the ending was pretty tender.NO CENSUS, NO FEELING (1940) - A hilarious short, with great scenes, the best being the part where all the guests end up with puckered lips after drinking punch with powdered alum in it. The football scenes are hilarious as well.SOME MORE OF SAMOA (1941) - Excellent film. This is filled with zany, fast-paced gags from beginning to end, with perfect direction from Del Lord, excellent performances from the Stooges, and wonderful uses of sound effects. One of the Stooges' best."
1,Three Stooge shorts from their later days.,"Three films: CASH AND CARRY; NO CENSUS, NO FEELING; SOME MORE OF SAMOA. Jules White co-directed."
1,"looks good, but...","I liked the appearance of these shoes, but I could barely get them on my feet. The openings had no stretch! I even had a friend try them on in case my feet were too fat. Her thin feet didn't like them either!"
3,"Easy Spirit ""Pickoff""","This is an attractive looking shoe ideal for walking or running errands. The shoe is very light compared to an athletic sneaker and won't feel heavy on your foot. I agree with the other reviewer that the opening of the shoe does not stretch very much making it difficult to get your foot in. Also, the tab on the back of the sneaker isn't very big either so this isn't much help when trying to pull the sneaker on as well. When I first used these, I had on an athletic sock and after a while, the back of the shoe was starting to dig into my ankle. So next time, I will try wearing them with a thin nylon sock instead."
5,Comfortable !!!,I dont normally wear sneakers but I find these to be extremely comfortable and lightweight. its a little bit difficult to get your foot in the opening but that is a minor problem for me. The fit is perfect once you get them on. I would recommend them anytime.
4,Yet another repackaging of the same old shows,"Don't get me wrong, some of the material on this set is first rate (though the sound quality is always mediocre at best...), but the bulk of this 3cd set is material already available as ""Teenage Lust"" and ""Starship"". The remaining ""EP"" CD is from the Unitarian church show of September '68. I haven't checked yet to see if these last tracks are the same previously released on various discs including ""American Ruse"", but it seems probable.....Nice little package, but nothing the MC5 collector doesn't have already....."
4,"Very, Very Good.","I am obsessed with Francesca Lia Block. As a 16 year old, I feel like I can really relate to her stories. I have read all of her books and the Dangerous Angels series is one of my favorites, so I was skeptical upon reading this book because Weetzie is all grown up. However, I was in for a pleasant surprise. This book still has all the magic of her others, and is interesting in a different way. I enjoyed catching up with Weetzie, Witch Baby, Cherokee, etc. so many years later. My only complaint is that her style in this book was slightly different, but I guess it had to be because times had changed for Weetzie. The book also made me a bit depressed about getting older. Regardless, I really enjoyed the book and will read it many times again. A definite read."
5,Simply GREAT,"When I initially scanned the different cuts, I didn't quite know what to think. It was a bit jazzy, a bit latin, a bit blues, a bit techno, a bit euro, a bit lounge,.. like where is this album going? Finally, I gave it a spin, or 2, or 3... The longer it was playing, the more often I kept on going back and checking if I was still listening to the same album. Then I realized that that is what made it so great. This is a great Chill Out album without the repetition or boredom.It's hard to believe that this is all from the same artist/composer; he is so versatile, setting off so many different moods, not monotonous (like so many albums that we've all come across where the artist is playing the same theme over and over). Billy Paul Williams can go from laid back to intense, from smooth to club, while never being too intrusive.Enough said, if you enjoy Chill Out that doesn't get stuck in one groove or on one beat or theme, you'll love this one!"
4,"Late to the party, but still groovin'!","What can be said about Mr. Williams that the back of the CD doesn't already address?""Seductively hypnotic with a perfect blend of mellow instrumental grooves sprinkled with tasty vocals!""What Billy has done here is blend the Smooth Jazz genre with thenu Chillout craze, and he's created a Downtempo monster! Although considered electronica by most, the grooves are fresh and alive as they mesh with Billy's ability to tickle the ivories. His guitar is a warm, full sound that would make George Benson sit up and hit repeat!If you're a chillout/smooth jazz fan, this CD was made for you, and the part I enjoy most is that it's one of those ""mixed"" CD's, so the music never ends!You're instructions are simple, slide CD in, press play and let the day's cares fade away......"
5,A pleasant surprise,"I found this album while on a search for music that would most effectively blend the two styles of music that my girlfriend and I liked. Those two styles being jazz and techno/house. This album fit the bill and much more. A great relaxing album that stays mellow while remaining full of soul and creative artistry. It has come to take a place in my faves. An original and truly a hidden gem. If you're looking for some great downtempo stuff, I highly recommend you pick this up. You'll be glad you did."
1,where is my item?,I have had bad experience with ebay and textbooks so i only order amazon. Unfortunately i never got this book either. I had to purchade one at school and i am annoyed. I want my money back and i dont recommend anyone ordering from this seller. I have also sent emails and this person hasnt responded.
1,patheic thing,"this one is a complete bummer from start to finish.the sound is horrible {all ""original jazz classic"" label sound is poor}but this one is something special.byrd is playing the guitar very shallow and he sounds tired.dont buy it=you lucky"
2,Didn't exactly fit,Got this hoping to replace my 1000 model that I got in the late 90s.Turns out it's not a perfect match. But it will still work. You just can't put a lot of pressure on it or it will fly apart.
3,Barely Audible Alarm beep,"This watch looks good, and feels good on the wrist, but I ended up returning it as the alarm beep was barely audible. I purchased this watch for the features offered but I needed a louder alarm sound."
5,Super Absorbent,"Molicare is a premium product at a reasonable price. Super absorbent. Comfortable fit. A bit bulky. Molicare Super-Plus Briefs are perfect for night time use. But you might want something less bulky for wearing under clothing during the day. Heavy wetters will find they are not completely leakproof, but then, no diaper is completely leakproof if you don't change them when they are full."
5,Exactly what I look for in an adult brief,"I've bought Molicares before, and I know that they're fantastic at what they do. That being said, I didn't get my order this time, due to somebody stealing my mail. Nonetheless, Molicares do exactly what they're made to do, and they're the best at it. I would definitely recommend these to somebody who needs a stronger incontinence product."
1,A bad book for 7 th graders like me,"this is a bad and very confusing book for a young student in, say... 7th grade, like me. The language is incomprehensible and there are no visual aids."
4,Opinión general,HUmmm!! parece interesante este librito. Pero la verdad busco uno donde encuentre aplicaciones a la ingeniería.Estos libros de teoría suelen ponerse aburridos al no tener sufuciente información sobre aplicaciones.De todos modos apenas lo tenga en las manos y lo mire doy una opinión más seria de este.
3,Good computer graphics book. Bad mathematics book.,"This book was written by a regarded expert in the fields of digital image processing and data compression, and illustrates well how some ""abstract"" mathematical concepts can be applied successfully to such purposes.However, it is evident that it was written in a rush, and the results can be seen. I have found a lot of typographic mistakes, errors in the exercises, and even errors in some of its mathematical proofs. Also, the author pays almost no attention to the fundamental concept of fractal geometry: the fractal dimension.I read this book because I needed a strong background in fractal geometry to write my Bachelor's thesis, but got dissapointed because of its mathematical defficiencies, and eventually decided to move to better sources on the subject.Please check my other reviews in my member page (just click on my name above)."
5,Awesome,so inexpensive - great for my son. He was out in Arizona at the time - and I mailed this directly to him - he was thrilled to receive this and used it for a class. Thanks.
4,Nice for the price!,"I bought this blanket as a gift because I own a down-alternative bed topper and I like it very much, especially during the winter. The cover is soft and the stitching is high-quality, and I like the satin finish on the edge. The only problem with down alternative stuffing is its tendency to pack down over time. It can be re-fluffed by popping it in the dryer. I would buy the product again."
5,I tell everyone to buy one,"For my climate it is excellent. It is light, non allergenic (I'm allergic to down) and it feels good."
3,Nice but not as warm,"This is your basic nice-looking white comforter. I was hoping to find a comforter as warm as the down one that we were replacing (which made my daughter sneeze), but this is not that warm. I haven't used it, but my daughter still requires several blankets on top of it."
4,The Altar Boy,"For a first novel, Mr. McDonald did a very nice job. Good characterizations and very believable dialogue. The story line was good. He writes about what he knows, that being the world of finance. I read his bio....what is a mud engineer?"
5,"Crisp and intelligent, with vibrant characters","Mr. McDonald offers a grounded, intelligent snapshot of life on Wall Street and beyond, peopled by a variety of memorable characters. Perhaps surprisingly, given the Wall Street setting, the older personalities are drawn with particular flair and heart. The protagonist, too, emerges as vivid and real: more someone you know than just a character in a book. A fine first novel."
5,Subtle and sexy,I loved this book and want to recommend it to others. The characters are amazingly real. Clements is a master of describing characters' inner lives so that you see poignantly the dissonance between their thoughts and actions. I loved the book and am still missing the characters.
3,Light Summer Read,"Based on the customer reviews, especially the reference to Gatsby and The Big Chill, I purchased this book and read it. I was not as impressed as the previous readers. It was an easy, light summertime read....but I found most of the characters to be self-absorbed, immature and completely neurotic. I could see possibly hanging out with Susie, Kay, Dodge and maybe Billy....but Elise and Ron were irritating and mean spirited and I can't imagine most people could put up with them for one weekend, let alone a whole summer. That said, the writing was very evocative of the Hudson Valley and the easy feeling of warm summer weekends and Ms. Clements character development (regardless of whether you liked the characters or not) was excellent."
2,Dull. Trite. Not unlike _The Big Chill_,"The dust jacket looked interesting, and when I saw the blurb by Michael Cunningham, the Pulitzer Prize Winning author of _The Hours_, I really wanted to read it. Unfortunately, Clements lacks the literary skill and descriptive dexterity that would put her in the same league as Cunningham. I have read some of the reviews that describe this novel as ""subtle""; I think the more appropriate description would be ""shallow."" The characters are two dimensional and neurosis replaces character development. I would recommend Edith Wharton's _House of Mirth_ instead....if you must read it, check it out of the library or read it in an airport bookstore while you wait for your flight."
5,birthday gift,outstanding product. received actually rather quickly. haven't openend it yet. it's a birthday gift for my daughter.
3,Up and running and then it Breaks,"It starts off with a track that hooks you, and yes, louder does make it better. One can imagine being in the club with the music booming, which is a nice touch, with it being recorded and mixed live. By the third track, Blue Light Fever's ""DJ"" opens up and makes this cd happen. Unfortunately, after that, none of the other tracks keep the intensity of ""DJ"", and by the end of the cd, if you're not much of a breaks listener, you'll be left wondering what happened to the good stuff that makes you want to shake your groove thang. And that's what a live dj is supposed to do, get you hyped up and make you shake your groove thang."
5,What more can you ask for,"What more can you ask for, this CD is HOT AS FCUK! From beginning to end the beats just pound out of your speakers, making your sub earn its keep, or proving to your friends that spending $1000 on a system for your car can be worth it. I've been listening to it nonstop, keeping my neighbors awake, and annoying the hell out of old people everywhere."
5,Baby Got Breaks,Baby Anne may be a pompous woman that can't entertain a crowd (she spins and stands) but I will say this CD is by far one of her best. Infiniti brings a lot of great beats to the table. Just great!
3,Size does count!,The current version of this edging is considerably smaller than the older versions and does NOT match the edging of the same brand that I was going to add to in my yard.Larry Leikam
3,Book came through partially damaged.,"Although the damage was not bad enough to warrant me sending it back, the packaging was torn and some of the cover was showing. Not sure if was the packaging or the handling."
5,Good Cartoon,"This cartoon is fun for kids to watch, and brings back good memories from my younger years. It has a catchy theme song and the good guys always come out on top. Not as 'dark' as the turtle cartoons today."
2,Where's the second disc?,"The cover says ""2-DISC SET!"" and lists 16 episodes, but when opened it's a single-disc case containing what's labeled ""DISC 1"", which has eight episodes on it. Where's the other disc with the rest of the episodes?"
5,COWABUNGA!!!,Well another awesome action packed season of the teenage mutant ninja turtles. All the classic episodes keep coming. So all you die hard fans buy up.
4,Season 3 Part 4,"For reason instead of releasing TMNT Season 3 in one complete set, LionGates released it in four volumes (3-6). Probably because there were 47 episodes that aired during the 1989 season.The episodes on this single disc volume are:The Turtle TerminatorThe Great BoldiniThe Missing MapThe Gang's All HereThe GrybyxMr. Ogg Goes to TownShreddervilleBye, Bye FlyThe Big Rip-offThe Big Break-InThe Big Blow-OutPlan 6 From Outer SpaceFinally we get the final twelve episodes from season three of one of my favorite cartoons from when I was a kid. It is a must own for TMNT fans."
5,That one cartoon that I remember from my childhood,This is totally that one cartoon I remember from my childhood! There were ninjas and turtles and everything! It was awesome!
2,Season 3 Part 4 of Classic TMNT,"Although on the cover it says `13' episodes on the cover but really this is like the final `12' episodes of Season 3. The reason for that is that they somehow managed to put the first episode of Season 4 amongst this set and that really don't make any sense on why they would want to do that. Just like the first `5' volumes this is the same way, all episodes on one disc, not leaving to put anything else with them. While I like having the set for the episodes but how the series has been handled, makes some wonder if this was the way that they had planned for the series which in a way not good for the company. Overall I give this set like the others 2.5 stars out of 5."
2,i could have bought beer insted,"this is very bad, the Punk o ramas just keep getting worse.It all sounds to trendy not like the first punk o ramas.Alot of the bands are good but the songs just arnt rockin.I was very happy to see a NFAA song and its a good song, but the album just dosnt sound punk, you cant sit down and drink beer and listen to it from start to finish, you listen to about 3 or 4 songs and then put on somthin else.My advise is buy punk o rama 1,2 or 3 or buy some beer and go skate."
2,review for vol 7&8,"Vol 7 and 8 I find quite different in feel from vol 1-6. I don't know if this is because the bands are getting older and more fixated on overproduction (ala Rush), or just trying to get into that Blink182 market; but the same chords over and over sound a lot better with some raw youthful power. Hey I'm old but still remember what punk sounds like."
1,what the hell is this?!?!,"this cd sucks. i cant believe theres freakin RAP on a punk cd!!!! i never thought id see the day when that happened. if you like punk, save yourself the 6 or 7 bucks and go buy the new nofx cd or something. cuz this was the biggest waste of money."
3,Depens on your uses,"If you like to buy a CD and listen to it through, this is a crappy CD. Hwoever, if you just buy CDs to take your favorites and make mixes out of them, this CD is awesome. The overall quality isn't very good(it has rap for Pete's sake), but there are a few excellent songs. My three favorite songs come from this CD: I Am A Revanant(The Distillers), Who We Are(Bad Religion), and Lose Another Friend(No Fun At All). Other solid tracks are The Idiots Are Taking Over(NOFX), Shattered Faith(Bad Religion), and Contribution(Guttermouth)."
2,punkorama 8,"The best songs on the CD are NOFX - The idiots are taking over, and F-MInus - Sweating Blood. I own both of the cd's these songs came from so that kinda sacked. I hate the Distillers, DKM, and Turbonegro. Also I saw Pulley at a show recently, and didn't like 'em. The Cd was a gift, and not a bad one, just there are probably much better ones, even for the price. And I don't think I'll ever buy another Punk O Rama, because the Give 'em The Boot compilations are like 10 times better, and even then I don't like compilations, 'cause I end up skipping like 10 outta 15 tracks. Save your money and buy an actual CD, I'd say buy the F-Minus CD, its good."
1,Oh Puhleeze!,"I am giving this POS one star because zero and below it is not an option. The book is an aggressively pro-white, anti-Indian piece of crap; how any respectable publisher would put this out as any kind of true history is beyond me. As is how the writer managed to get a TEACHING gig at the University. What the book says is basically that every land swindle, act of aggression or simple rotten behaviour of whites toward the tribes was understandable, and every act or word of Native protest against the mistreatment was wrong. I think the writer must have some kind of link to the KKK or something. This really should be pulled from the shelves or at least labeled fiction (racist fiction at that) in the name of truth and fairness. Sorry we wasted our cash on this, will never buy anything written by this idiot again."
4,Alzheimer's from peer's point of view,"I bought the movie while researching for alzheimer's in-service. I didn't end up using this film in my training, but enjoyed it none the less"
3,Be prepared to be sad,"The acting is superb and the issues presented are compelling. However, this is very depressing, despite the attempt at a positive ending. Admittedly, their residence is pretty posh and they are well cared for by staff, so this is not about the horrors of a nursing home. It is about the sadness of growning old, having friends die, trying to placate family, and doing the best to ""keep a stiff upper lip."" I think good viewers for this film would be the children of an elderly person and really tough old people."
4,Excellent Can Opener,"After being frustrated with the poor quality of store bought can openers, I found this gem on Amazon. The price was reasonable and Oneida was I name I thought I could trust. Well, I wasn't disappointed. This can opener is solid, substantial, works very smoothly and looks great as well. I would recommend this can opener to anyone who is sick and tired of the cheap [...] that you find these days at supermarkets and drugstores ."
1,Fell apart on third use,"This thing or Gadget as the ad says fell apart on the third can opening. The rivet or suppose to be rivet that holds this Gadget together is actually two pins pressed one inside the other and has lost its grip so this Gadget has come apart at the hinge. ""Made in China"""
2,False Rhetoric,"Soros argues here that he helped fund democracy in order to 'open up' the economies of the eastern bloc, including Russia. Nevertheless any study of Soros's multi-billion dollar Hedge fund style investments will show that he has not only funded democracy but he has invested heavily in these countries to earn a profit. Keeping democracy alive mostly is in self interest to the Soros pocket book, rather then any benevolent idea of helping the 'people' of Eastern Europe, who mostly remain poor and starving, subjected to terror and mafia style corruption that did not exist under totalitarian Communism. In the end the people of Eastern Europe traded the false-god of Communism for the equally false-god of investment banking and cowboy capitalism, with Soros at the forefront.A dangerous text full of self obsession and slight of hand regarding Soros's personal investments in these societies, smacking of conflict of interest.Seth J. Frantzman"
5,poetry in motion,"Besides the excellent photos, a true pictorial guide to Reno, the writing as the truly conveys the poetry that surrounds the human endeavor of the races. It is a real testimonial to the races, a passioned look at them, the machines, flyers, ground crew and everyone that make Reno happen. So, much more than a dry text, Handleman really achieved a text where we can almost feel the electric razor sharp voltage that makes your hair raise with excitement, the feeling that something greater is happening. For the air race enthusiast this should be a great book, because of the photos and the text. If looking for something more detailed, with listings of winners, secret engine setups or deep data on racing history this isn't the best choice. For the feeling of it then this is a must, one can almost here the roaring of the engines jumping out of the pages."
2,Not a fan,"This left a weird after taste. I like the powder much much much better. Not for me, but it is convent."
1,Awful Bitter Taste,"This product has a really bitter taste to it. It ended up in my garbage after trying it twice, once in my hot tea and once in my oatmeal. I'll stick with Splenda until Truvia becomes affordable."
5,Surprisingly Good!,"I have been looking for a way to give up splenda which is my favorite artificial sweetener. So, a friend told me about this particular brand. I had bought another company's stevia (in a green box) and found that it really didn't give me a palatable reason to switch. So, I tried my friends suggestion and it's true. For me, there is no bitterness in aftertaste, and it certainly does not remind me of motor oil! Is it as good tasting as splenda? Well, it's a close one. The benefits of stevia outway the long term effects of splenda (sucralose) or nutrasweet(aspartame). I am not so sure that I would allow my boys to use it though. They can have natural sugar in moderation. Dr. Oz gave a thumbs down for stevia because there is some information out there that it may cause sterility. It's something to think about. However, most of us use these sugar-like products because we have some problem with sugar itself. I say, educate yourself -- and make your choice."
5,The best stevia I've tried,"I've tried a number of liquid and powdered stevias, and this is by far my favorite. My husband stole my bottle after he tried it, because he loves it in his iced tea, and he's never liked the stevias I've bought before. The flavors are fun for coffee, but the plain is fantastic for iced tea. It has no carbs, unlike powdered stevias, if you're a carb counter. I emailed their support and asked.If you get a bitter aftertaste, you're definitely using too much. Start with a few drops and go from there."
5,Stevia Clear Liquid has no after taste. Very Pleased.,"I spent hours researching for a sugar substitute that would taste most like sugar. The reviews about Stevia Clear Liquid convinced me to take a chance. I'm glad I did. As earlier reviewers said, if you do not over do it, this particular one has no after taste. I drop 2 drops into a glass of juice, tea, or cup of coffee. If it needs more sweetening I use a pack of the stevia. It's not overly sweet as I prefer it, but I feel so much better having discontinued the normal blue, pink & yellow pack diet sugars. Much healthier to use too."
4,Good,This sweetener is good.I wish Amazon had enough brains to tell you how many drops are equivalant to 1 teaspoon of suger.I even called up Amazon to try to convince them to maybe show a photo of the back of the bottle so people know how much to use.Can you believe they said they have no control over that?
1,Describe the taste in one word......,"Yuck!I have used the stevita stevia supreme packets in the past and they were great! So I assumed the liquid would be good too. There is a ""motor oil"" aftertaste with the liquid! Do NOT buy this as a sugar substitute."
4,Good price,"I like using liquid stevia in drinks because it is easier to regulate than the powdered form. This brand is priced low, but I find I need to use almost twice as much as the SweetLeaf brand."
3,Takes too much to sweeten,"For the small bottle I expected a little to go a long way. I started out trying to sweeten a cup of tea. I started with 2 drops because I have some powdered stevia that are super concentrated. So I couldn't even taste that so I added 6 more drops since 8 drops was the recommended serving. It still wasn't sweet, I could taste a tad bit but not sweet. Long story short it took about 30 drops to sweeten my one cup of tea and by the time it got sweet enough for my liking there was a bitter aftertaste. I tried making a half gallon of tea. I have another brand of stevia that takes 1/8 of a teaspoon to sweeten a gallon of tea. I lost count of how many drops i added to that half gallon of tea but it wound up using almost half of the 1.35 ounce bottle and by that time it was too much, still not sweet enough, and had a bitter aftertaste. The powdered brand that I use has no bitterness to it at all. I won't buy this again."
5,Great Book!,I really enjoyed A River Away and read it in less than a day. I was really intrigued by author Marilyn Dungan's writing ability. I would recommend the book to readers that enjoy American history and adventure laced with a tender love story.
5,best choice for the price,It is very solid and high quality product.It looks very impressive and have really high quality optics.I think this is the best choice for the price.I have 5 binoculars at home and this one is my favorite.
1,Not as expected,The countries are just not well defined enough to use this as a teaching tool for your kids and it deflates way too easily. They will treat it as a beach ball more than anything else. Stick with an actual globe which is far more useful.
3,"Works, but gets treated more as a toy or beach ball.","It works for teaching. But when giving it to kids under 6, they pretty much only kick and throw it. I think I should have just spent more for a globe that wouldn't be fun to throw and kick. And even though the price seemed right. It feels even cheaper and less durable that I thought it would be. So it works, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have any teaching in mind. And as a beach ball, there are better beach balls out there. So it doesn't do either one great."
4,"Tufts Kid's Day, April 12, 2008","We used this soft inflated globe at the Baha'i stand at Tufts University Kid's Day last April. The globe was a perfect solution to managing varied numbers of children ages 3 to 12 while illustrating that ""the world is but one country and mankind its citizens,"" a precept of the Baha'i Faith. While tossing the ball the kids participating could name the different countries, or sports each country was known for, and at the same time interact cooperatively with their fellows. The globe lasted perfectly through about 200 youngsters handling it."
1,"Oops, they did it again!","I wish I had read the single review for this company (Apr 07). They did the exact same thing to me. I ordered the Shiek Leather contour belt while in Iraq, but they sent the canvas one instead (of course charging at the leather price)."
1,Same Problem For Me,"Poor service, the same thing happened to me, I paid for the leather belt and they sent me the cheaper material type belt. This was a Christmas present for my brother and you can imagine BOTH of our disappointment when he opened the gift and it was COMPLETELY wrong. I may update this review depending on their willingness to correct the issue...."
1,Chris,This had to be the worst merchandise anyone could possible think of spending money on. I would recomend buying any other cleaner before ever thinking of concord technology again.
5,An awesome piece of art,"It's Banksy, what more can you ask.The book is filled with great of shots of his work.The finish and quality are awesome."
2,bleh,i bought the book because i was once fascinated by banksys workbut after reading this book i was left unimpressed. im glad banksy is making moneyoff of dumb rich snobs who follow one art trend to the next. after reading this booki felt like i should have went to a bookstore and stolen it instead.
1,This book is now redundant,"Most of the pictures, and more, in this book are available online on his Web site. Also, for someone so against capitalism, it's ironic that he should have a copyrighted book, and a DVD."
1,bored and trite,"someone is trying to hard,you know the sex pistols song, so bored with the U.S.A., feel the same about banksy.lets make some banksy art,take something iconic and easily recognizable... lets say a Nunthen add something subversive or ironic.... like a sexual toy.juxtapose them together.voila... bansky art.now you are underground street artist,I am so f'ing impressed"
5,Amazing,I've always liked Bansky and this is a great piece of inspiration for my Graffiti. Thanks so much I love it
4,How can you NOT consider this art?,"This is a GREAT coffee table book. Lots of great photos of his works presented well with great comments and anecdotes scattered throughout. Covers his work on public places (such as bridges, statues, landmarks) to his bold methods of putting his art up in plain view in public and in some pretty well known art museums. His art has great, thought provoking messages so it's so hard to not like this type of expression. It can run from hilarious to almost scary. I am going to take away a star because I find that while I like his art and his audacity to place it on an uncommon canvas and keeps it relevant to the everyday public, I find his messages tend to jump on the band wagon. He protests the war, corruption of the justice system, the greed and ambivalence of big business, etc. Not new territory to tread. While it brings these issues back into the minds of the reader or viewer, the messages aren't anything nouveau."
5,Genius,"Not only is the current generation of street artists mostly brilliant but Banksy, in particular, possesses a type of rare genius. He challenges authority with wit and intelligence. And, baby, can he draw. It is always impressive to find an artist who not only has something to say, but who says it in a new, unique and deliciously indignant way. Thank you, Banksy, for offering up a wonderful amalgam of some of your best, and for sharing it with the public... even if it is now sitting on a coffee table in a suburban home. I think Banksy must enjoy the irony of it all."
3,OK - But just like the artist Blek le Rat,"Anyone thinking Banksy is original should check out the pioneer of this type of art, Blek le Rat, who's been doing this since the beginning of the 80's. It's scary just how much as been copied from him.Blek le Rat (Street Graphics / Street Art)"
5,Awesome Book,"I've had negative views on street artwork but this book has changed my perspective. Banksy's artwork has positive and frank messages, all in a picture or two, whether taken seriously or jokingly, this artist's work is very admirable."
4,Paint on cutting edges caused a lower rating,"The sod plug cutter took a while to arrive but was safely packaged. Appears well made and rugged for years of use. The cutting surface (the box part) was covered with paint so the edges didn't cut well. A few passes with a file takes the paint off, sharpens the edge and makes it all better. Please note that unless the sod is well watered, a lot of effort is needed to stomp it into the turf. Heavy hard-soled boots help to drive it in. The transplanted plugs of grass have not done so well."
3,"Not as good as ""False Cathedrals""","I don't like this one as much as I like ""False Cathedrals"", the album before this. That's because of many different things. First they have tuned down Chris Hidgons vocals, so its not as easy to hear as earlier, wich is a shame since he has a really good singingvoice (I read somewhere on the internet saying he have the voice of an angel, that's a bit exaggerated, but still..). Second, they have turned down the intensity - On ""False Cathedrals"" their music was so powerfull, so dramatic and majestic it blew me away, but on ""Song In The Air"" the music lacks the ""punch"". Third, there's for som reason more guitarnoice/distortion on this one, wich messes up the melodies. And last, ""False Cathedrals"" was (is) such a wonderfull album that ""Song In The Air"" just can't match up to, too bad for Elliott.And finally, Chris Hidgon has a new band, and a new album, due iut ca. december - I can't wait."
1,disappointed.,"what happened guys. the last record rocked. now this. if you like 10 songs that don't rock, but more like rock you to sleep, then buy this record. otherwise, save your cash."
1,Take the descriptions with a grain of salt,"Yes, you can build 3 robots wit this kit. However they use a common chassis so you can only have 1 running at a time. The description and the photo would lead you to believe otherwise. The instructions are poor at best. The kit comes with 3 circuit boards each with a different behavior. There is nothing in the instructions to explain the differences or offer any explanations for how they work.The actual building of the robot is very limited, so the educational aspect is pretty much limited to figuring out what the behavior of each control board is. My kids got board with the limited interaction in about 10 minutes.This product does not get my recommendation."
1,Crummy instructions make it worthless!,"The instructions don't match the product, and are impossible to follow. If you're not an engineer, or don't have prior knowledge of electronics, forget it! (I love how the other reviewer needed her brother, a mechanical engineer, to figure it out.) My husband tried when we got this 3 years ago, when my son was 10. He couldn't do it. I tried just now, I couldn't do it. At this point it's either throw it away, or let the box take up closet space until my son, now 14, learns enough electronics to maybe use it for something else.As a toy for ages 8 & up, as it says on the box, a complete waste of money."
2,An Historical treatise !,"Much as I enjoy the Southern works of Frances Parkinson Keyes,I found this one to just too much like a text book work on the Civil War with just a few extraneous characters thrown in to make a story of it.It would probably be of great interest to students of history with its descriptions of battles and military personnel,but,without having a particular interest in the Civil War (or as she always referred to it-The War Between the States ),I found it to be rather heavy going and did a lot of ""skipping""."
4,Nice wireless controller,"This is a great product. I haven't experienced any connection/lag problems, the sticks and buttons feel nice and responsive, and of course it's wonderful not being tethered to the PS2 while I play.My only complaint with this controller is that it's not quite as comfortable in the hands as the DualShock 2. In games that don't use the trigger buttons often, I like to rest my index fingers behind the controller body in the space under the triggers. On this controller, that empty space doesn't exist because it's occupied by the battery compartment. I have to rest my index fingers on the triggers at all times, which is probably how a lot of people hold the controller anyway, but it feels a bit awkward to me.Aside from that small issue, I heartily recommend this controller to anyone with a PS2."
4,great controller!,All i have to say this is a great product... hasnt given me any problems.. so a must buy for any playstation 2 owner...
5,Love it.,"Product is as described. I've always been a fan of Logitech, and will always choose that brand over any others. I would suggest this controller over any other ones."
2,Breaks easily,Have tried so many cordless controllers and they all go down in flames. This is no different. Lasted a year or so of very light usage and died.
2,"D-pad issues, but solid otherwise","In a nutshell, I'm happy about everything about this controller when comparing it to the official PS2 wired controller. I like the battery life, the overall feel, the responsiveness.However, the d-pad is noticeably not as precise as the official controller."
5,wireless is the way to go,So worth the price to be able to play PS2 without my dog getting tangled in the contgroller cords LOL. They have a great range and the battery life is super long. Buy it if you are a true gamer.
4,PS2 Cordless Controller,"The controller works well. The front buttons are a little hard to push, but they are getting better. Overall I would purchase this controller again if need be."
4,PS2 Cordless Controller freedom,"My kids were always having problems with the cords, tangling or pulling out of the socket. Now they can bounce all over the room while they play without any problems. The signal is always strong and the controllers work from quite a distance from the console. The only thing keeping it from a 5 rating is that they didn't do anything to improve the tactile feel of the controller. This controller equals the Sony corded controller and works great. My kids are very happy with these contollers."
5,Yes what a controller,This is the second one I had to buy since my dear daughter spilled nail polish remover on the other one. It gives freedom and words great.
4,Better PS2 Controller than expected,"Well you won't go too wrong with this controller here as it's performing better than any other PS2 controller I've used so far. It fits comfortably in your hands, the response time is fluid, the analog sticks and buttons perform as well as Sony's DualShock 2 if not better. My only complaint would be the D-pad. Where sony's has the 4 way d-pad protuding from the controller for better location of direction, the logitech one has 8-way pad which could hurt if you need to pinpoint a certain location and at times feels stiff. The wireless adapter is sleek and lights up green for each button press or directional change. The Vibration function is very strong and can be easily tuned off. Also the finish of the controller itself is smooth and should prevent sweaty palms. If you want the best performing controller for the PS2 and are sick of wires, then this is the only product you should spend your money on."
1,Great Product if you like buttons that stick,"It's true what everyone says about this controller, it is great, has good range, feels good, no lag, excellent battery life, but the buttons stick!I bought it a week ago and the buttons stick from the beggining. I understand Logitech is aware of this problem and they will replace the unit if your buttons stick, but it doesnt matter because the unit they will replace it will also has buttons that will stick eventually since the construction is the same. My friend has this controller and his buttons also stick especially the x button (aka. the most used button in the controller) So unless you want to experience the inconvenience of sticky buttons I suggest you stay away from this controller unless you know that Logitech has corrected this problem."
3,It Works!,"I got the right controller that i wanted, but the controller that was advertized was no where to be found instead i just got this black one with lame looking buttons, where did the color go. The only thing that looked like the ad were the joysticks with the blue aruond them. Over all though i have used it a little over 100 hours and it still is working an so are the battiers that came with it, So thanks Amazon."
5,Great controller!,"This controller is fantastic. It feels good in the hands, operates flawlessly via wireless connection, and uses 2 AA batteries (mine are rechargeable, which helps a lot ... I always recommend rechargeable batteries for game controllers). I can sit far away from the TV and still play without a problem. Having no wires is great because there is no tripping or tangling going on.Btw, I should add that I am very picky about my controllers. I have had several bad controllers in the past (e.g. buttons that stick, buttons that you have to press really hard to get a response, controllers that die within a week of use, etc.). Thankfully, this controller has given me no problems. I actually got it used and it works just fine. I highly recommend this product."
3,"Perfect, while it lasts.","I bought this in June 2006 and it worked great. I haven't had any issues with buttons sticking, lag, or interferece from our cordless phone or wireless router. The battery life is amazing, I haven't had to change them once in the 6 months that I've had it. I only get a chance to play every once in a while though, which made it even more disapointing that it broke so suddenly.Yesterday while I was playing, something in the L3 analog stick snapped. Now it is loose and useless. Other people have had this same problem. I'd hate to see how long this controller would last in the hands of a strong person.However, despite this problem, I am willing to buy another one because it is wireless. It is a great product, just don't expect it to last very long."
2,Both worked great until they broke,Bought a wireless and loved it for the few weeks it worked until the joystick broke. Bought another one and guess what? It not only broke but in the same place! This one lasted a few weeks as well.
5,Great Controller,"This controller feels great in your hands. In fact, after using this controller for awhile, my batteries went low and I had to switch back to the Dualshock controller. The Dualshock felt wierd in my hands. The response of the controller is good. I have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time. One down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time. I guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year."
2,Some defects,"This controler was disappointing. It has a few buttons that stick on it. It does work, but the sticking buttons ruin the experience."
3,Almost perfect!!,"This is a great control, the batteries last long (I think even more than 50 hours without vibration) and it works almost perfect. I would have given a 5 star if the X bottom didn't stay pressed down (sometimes) when I am playing. Maybe is the logitech design that the X bottom doesn't work always right. The orignal ps2 control, in the right, the bottoms( square, triangle, circle and x) are on a flat surface and that's why it works great. But this logitech design, the surface is not flat that's why the bottoms don't work as good as the original ps2 control. They should design a better control, but with flat surface for the bottoms to make it as functional as the original ps2 control."
4,Logitech PS2 Cordless Action Controller,Great overall look and feel. Not the lowest priced controller but I totally trust the logitech brand. Controller looks and feels much better than the sony controllers.
5,Great Controller - no lag,"This controller is wonderful. Don't worry about reception to the base. I can sit about 10 feet away and it works just fine, which is all I need. Response time is just as good as a wired controller and so far, this doesn't eat up too much battery life. Fits great in your hands. Truly a great product."
5,A great wireless controller...,"The fine points of this controller for me are essentially the same as in other reviews:1. Flawless wireless response2. Comfortable feel3. Solid weight and balance4. Great battery life (so far, 30 hrs on the first set)I'm completely satisfied with this controller and the price paid. I recommend it to anyone who wants a wired-quality wireless solution for their ps2."
2,"DELAY OF GAME, BUTTON LAG","The feel, size, weight, balance are all excellent on this controller. The joysticks have a non-slip coating that is excellent. I will return this device because of one reason, the tenth of a second delay on the buttons. It is just enough to make action games like ""Black"" twice as difficult to play. It is a real shame because everything else about this device is fantastic. One more small complaint, the pictures here show the buttons on the right are color coded to match original controler, mine were not. They are marked with circle, square, triangle and X, but all in black and white. The really sad news is that I have not found any other wireless that is any better."
3,Hassle Free play,I no longer have to untangle paddles or worry about someonewalking into the cord and pulling paddle out of my hand or my gameing unit onto the floor
2,Buy a new one every 6 months...not built to last.,"I really like the freedom of this controler but I have had 3 in one years time. The buttons start to stick or the L3 or L4 sticks break off completely, it really gets old after you spend all that cash.My son has a $9.00 controler that he has had for 2 years it really makes you think about the cash you put into this stuff. I like the freedom it gives ,and I am very dissappointed in Logitech I thought they would have been more dependable."
4,Easy and practical to use,Wireless controller is nice and allow for positioning freedom during game play. Documentation does not state if we can buy 2 units and avoid intereference when using both units on the same PS2 console.
1,not working,"theres not much to say other than it does,nt work it will not hook-up or connect with the controller. i dont know whats wrong but it will not connect with the device sending the signal"
4,"Excellent, but my wife still beat me on Mortal Kombat","Excellent control, i don't regret buying this. But my wife still beat me on Mortal Kombat."
3,Cordless Controller Needs Off/On Button,"I purchased one and could not get it to work, so I sent it back, but others who has this controller likes it. I probably would like it also, but it had one downfall, it did not have an on/off switch. The receiver just flashed and never connected with the controller. I still am going to get another one to try because of the recommendation of the local electronic store employee who has one and loves it."
4,controllers for the ps2,it is one of the better controllers out there for the ps2. the good part about this controller is one of the easy to used and battiers last decently.
5,Purchased for a gift,"I gave this controller as a Christmas gift. I do not personally use it, however the recipient of this gift says he loves it... easy to use... no more wires... glad I got it :-)"
3,Not pressure sensitive,"Great controller, but it is not pressure sensitive like the Sony Dualshock 2 controller. In other words, games like Metal Gear Solid will be a little hard to play without the pressure feature."
1,"Item incorrectly referred to as a game , not a game controller.","Cannot review as item is incorrectly referred to as a game, not a game controller. Plus I have already submitted a review for this item several weeks ago."
1,Very bad wireless controller,I bought the Nintendo GameCube Wireless Controller and It's so great I thought all future controllers should use wireless technology.My wife gave me this controller as a gift. From the first time I used it the controller had problems communicating with the PS2 receiver. After it fell down from the couch the first time the analog pad stopped working. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.It seems that the golden still applies. Only buy controllers that are made by the console's maker.
1,Does not work with XBOX wireless charger,This wireless controller does not work with XBOX wireless controller charger. Nothing like the real controller that come with the XBOX
1,Do NOT Buy!!,"I recieved this controller as a gift and it hasn't even worked properly once. Logitech support was no help, and the controller & receiver just flash at each other trying to make a connection that will apparently never occur. I'd have to say to stick with either traditional wired controllers or another brand of wireless controller for your system. Do not buy this piece of junk from Logitech."
4,A great Logitech product at a great price,"I have used and been impressed by Logitech products for years, and the Action Controller is no exception. The controller is larger than your wired controller, but not objectionably so. the range is excellent and the battery life is quite good. I have used it for several hours on a few different games and the thing performs as well as my wired controllers. I see no lag in action, and I completely forget I am using a wireless controller when I play the games. That is one of the touchstones I use for wireless devices: do they function well enough that you don't have to make accommodations and do they ""disappear"" when in use."
1,CONTROLLER GREAT FOR TINY HANDS,"I ordered the 997-000010 controller and it stated it was just like the original PS2 controller. It is not, it is smaller than the Playstation 2 OEM controller. If you are an adult, This controller is NOT for you. My hands are getting cramped because half my hand has nothing to hold on to. I will never buy a controller over the internet without trying it for fit in stores first and you should do the same. I feel let down by logitech. They should have made controller the same dimensions as original rather than trying to save a bit on plastic.:(""Feels familiarAll the controls are just where you expect them to be--it uses the standard PlayStation2 controller layout.""layout of buttons may be in same, but shape is way off."
3,good but buttons stick,"We have tried several other brands of cordless and this is the best for staying connected and working all the time. But after using for about 9 months the x button starts to stick. This is the second one to do this. Took the first one apart and found the silicone pad under the buttons crack and does pop back up you can turn it around but then the triangle button stick. tried to get a new silicone pad even contacted logitech, said parts are not availible. Its a shame to throw away a $40.00 controller for a .20 cent part. If someone knows where to get parts I would Like to Know."
2,OK,"EXCELLENT AT FIRST. BUT AFTER 6 MONTHS OR SO, PLAYING BUTTON MASHING GAMES BUTTONS WILL GET STUCK A LOT. LIKE X,TRIANGLE,SQUARE,CIRCLE."
2,Seven Months,"I have had three of these Logitech Wireless controllers now. They have all broken nearly seven months to the day I buy them.The problem is the same every time, the left analog stick breaks.My girlfriend got me my first one in December 2004 (Christmas). It lasted until about July 2005. I exchanged it at the store, and the new one lasted until maybe February 2006. I exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in September 2006.I am not really a heavy gamer. I play Madden and NCAA 2007 sparingly. I am very disappointed with this repeat problem.I also notice the ""X"" button sticking issue that others refer to here. I tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick. That seemed to work for a while.You really can't beat the convenience of wireless, and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability."
1,Good for a wile,"When I first got this controller in early Jan. '05 I loved it for all the reasons given in these reviews, but now after having it for a few months it has become exceedingly frustrating. The first problem was the R1 button would occasionally stick, then the up button on the d pad, which I only use for menu selection and not during game play, began to work sporadically. Now the R1 button sticks 90% of the time it is used and recently the controller lost it's signal during game play with no way to control, pause etc. I have since switched back to the standard controller that has over 4 years of aggressive game play with not so much as hint of a problem. I would strongly discourage anyone from wasting there $30 on this controller!"
1,Great except for D-pad,This controller works great until you decide to use the D-pad. The big problem we see is that if you press the D-Pad control and you get the tactile feedback of the button clicking the push may still not register. You have to apply more pressure to the pad beyond the point at which you feel the click. As a result your control is severely handicapped since you never know if you've pressed hard enough. My 8 year old son will not use this controller because of this way the D-Pad works.The analog joysticks are very responsive. The problem is only with the D-pad.
2,Wireless Router Users Beware!!!,"This is a great controller. But if you have a wireles router in your house, or if a nearby neighbor has one, there's a good chance this controller won't work. Both this controller and a wireless router (like linksys or D-link) work on 2.4 ghz frequency, which means that the router interfears with the wireless connectivity of this contoller. It'd be nice if Logitech made a controller that utilized a different frequency, but they don't. I experienced lag that was so bad, it made my games unplayable. But as soon as I turned off my router, the contoller worked fine, so I know that it was the router that was causing the problem. It broke my heart because this is a fine controller with rave reviews. Just a heads up."
1,This controller sucks,"I bought my first logitech wireless controller 1 yr ago and six months later the "" X "" button jammed on me..I recently purchased another wireless controller and the same issue happened again within 2 weeks. I will never purchase another logitech controller."
2,the x button WILL stick,"i've had this for 6 months. the X button sticks. they were at best buy to try out and the x button stuck on both of those too. until the button stopped working, this was the second best wireless i hadever used next to the wavebird."
3,Buttons Stick,I've had three of these controllers and every one of them has had to be returned for a refund b/c the button sticks. I think it's b/c I play games where you have to hold down a button for a long period of time. I love it when it's working b/c I can sit far away from my big screen but the button thing has been a huge annoyance.
5,I soooo love this controller!,"Easily the best cordless controller available. From the power-saving feature, to the immediate responsiveness, and even the ever-so-slightly pebbled finish on the plastic, this is a great controller.If you are looking for something to simply minimize the number of cords sprawling from your PS2 (like we were), or just as a replacement/addition, don't hesitate to purchase. Yeah, it's that good!"
5,Kickass controller!!,"I got this alongside God of War, and this beaut has seen me clear through the gruelling fights without the slightest hitch. And I haven't changed the batteries yet. Highly recommended!"
5,Logitech Cordless PS2 Controller ROCKS!,"This controller is the best I ever used. I was skeptical at first, but as soon as it arrived I fell in love. The controller is very comfortable and without wires it makes the gaming experience a lot more fun. After having this controller for 2 months now (on the same batteries) it is a real joy to have. No cables keeping you from moving about, being able to move freely is the best part of this product. I haven't had any problems with other devices that are wireless (phone, router) and this device has performed admirably. I'd recommend this to anyone. I'm thinking of buying another."
2,Wish there had been more details about recovery,"This book was in-depth history of her Eating Disorder (140 pages) and a short (40 pages) account of what happened to her during the start of recovery. She talked briefly about therapy. She talked very little about what the recovery felt like and the emotional and physical challenges she faced during recovery. I wish the book had in-depth details about the start of her recovery process, not just the years she suffered. Not a good recovery resource, but it was interesting and honest. Suffering from an Eating Disorder is the worst!"
4,An elegant description of a non-elegant disease.,"I've worked with hundreds of women suffering from bulimia at an inpatient treatment facility. This book does a very good job elegantly describing a very non-elegant disease. The author takes you through the emotional and day to day details of her bulimia from a child well into her adulthood with an important honesty and a pleasing writing style. She describes the onset subtly and poignantly and she spares no detail when writing about her lowest moments in the disorder. The ending, and her recovery, are inspiring but not sappy and unlike other books she describes the recovery process rather than glossing over it. This book is not perfect and drags at points, but the author does not let those moments last long. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about eating disorders and anyone suffering from one."
1,Strictly a memoir,"I read this memoir and realized very quickly, that Memoir was an accurate category for this book. It certainly does not belong in self help/recovery.Jocelyn's narrative keeps repeating descriptions of her terrible life in a way that makes this tragic disease seem petty. I have endured this dis-ease for 23 plus years and I found Aimee Lu's book ""Life after an Eating Disorder"" so full of hope and rcovery and revelation about this disease.I found this book to be full of triggers and narcissistic thoughts. It is a ""Go Ask Alice"" for eating disorders.""""Sensing the Self"" is also fantastic, but a little more clinical. If you are looking for recovery, read about recovery. If you are looking for a description of how tragic and destructive and miserable an addiction can be, read a memoir."
4,Very Informative,"As a counselor, my graduate education included a course on eating disorders; however, when I read this autobiography about a person suffering from Bulimia, the nightmare dimensions of this disorder became concrete. The author shares details of her daily pathological behaviors. I appreciated her candor and accuracy. I will certainly offer this book to others who may be experimenting with Bulimia. The Bulimic journey is so brutally self-destructive."
3,Ehhhh,"This Frisbee was awesome... until I did a trick catch and it cracked. It was floating down towards me and I hit it up right in the middle of the Frisbee with my pointer finger and cracked the Frisbee in the middle. It didn't crack all the way, but it was cracked and therefore altered the air passing over it and the Frisbee didn't fly right. I'm not sure I would buy it or recommend this product."
1,Horrible waste of talent and resources!,"The problem with this opera is director Martin Kusej. I tried to watch it to the end, but in vain; it's just too bizarre and boring. The set is a sterile white box and the action is just plain weird. Where have I seen this trash before? Answer: In the only Don Giovanni production I've ever seen that I didn't like. Ditto, Die Zauberflote. Both productions were directed by Martin Kusej. Beware of wasting your time and money on any further projects of his! Although it does take an unique ""anti-talent"" to transform a work of art into trash."
2,MISREPRESENTATION,"The item I received was not what was pictured or described on the Amazon website. There was no travel case and the yellow tube is a very small tube, about a foot long, that you put your foot in and do arm curls. There were no instructions on how to attach the tube to the door. I didn't send it back because I didn't want to pay another $7.00+ shipping charge. Therefore, the buyers should be wary of this vendor."
3,price varies drastically,"The selling price of Alpha Keri bath oil 8oz varies drastically among different sellers. The one I bought is US$17.96/8oz . Later I found that other sellers sell at US$8.99/8oz bottle & US$13.93 for 16oz bottle. Almost 50% less, what a big difference !"
4,beautiful lyrical translation,"The thirty stories that make up THE RED BRANCH TALES come from twelfth century Ireland translated into modern English with the beautiful lyrical prose that Dr. Randy Lee Eickhoff has brought to all his previous translations. The tales provide common themes of life among the various clans with the title providing an obvious clue as to what to expect. The stories vary in content with many dealing with heroism, war, and romance.The anthology is entertaining though like much of medieval literature, formal language is sprinkled with baroque eloquence and comically lewd capers. Also included are ""Fragments"" of incomplete tales and proverbs. As usual Dr. Eickhoff provides a marvelous collection, that will be of interest to English majors and those readers who recently savored The Canterbury Tales or Beowulf.Harriet Klausner"
4,marvelous retelling of Ulster myths,"More of a retelling rather than a strict translation, this book is nevertheless researched thoroughly by the author. Covering many of the stories of the Ulster Cycle of myths, there are stories here that I actually hadn't heard before, as I am sure will be the case for many other readers. Overall, a great book, and not to be missed by someone interested in Irish and Celtic mythology."
5,Comfy,"These are excellent for work, very comfortable and light, i wear them in my office in winter. They are even good to be worn on a hot summer day.They are very breathable, get cold quickly so not to be worn in the fall, summer shoes really."
5,How the first women soldiers forged new ground for the rest,"This book tells how it was for the first women to serve our country. There is happiness, saddness, and even the bittersweet. The Army had to switch gears to provide the ""right"" sizes for women, which even now we don't always get the right size, so it's the closest men's size. The fact that the training took place in the Midwest in the winter at a converted US Cav. post was fascinating to learn. To bad Fort Des Moines was not conservered for others to see. This was a wonderful and insightful book to read. I recommend it for anyone interested in women's place in military history."
5,Recommended book,"This book provides a profound and up-to-date description of wirelesssensor networks (WSNs), one of the hot topics in today's networkresearch area. All aspects of wireless sensor networks aredescribed in detail. These aspects are:* types and capabilities of sensor nodes* network architectures for WSNs,* types and characteristics of layer-specific communication technics andprotocols in WSNs, including physical-layer considerations up toapplication-specific support of WSNs* applications in WSNs.The authors do not only describe solutions for a lot of selective problems inWSNs (the bibliography has more than 900 entries), they also considerdependencies between these solutions and influences of these solutions on thewhole WSN.This book is recommended for all readers who are interested in specific designchallenges and solutions for WSNs."
5,Damn sharp,Right out of the box it shaves the hairs off my arm. Good balance too. Too bad its made in China though.
3,could have read a better book 'twice' as fast,"Though it was occasionally interesting, she should have concentrated on telling a more cohesive story. Stretched-out sentences and big word embellishments , though skillful, made it a hard read and added to the confusion. ambiguous, challenging, overly wordy..."
1,Too small,"The inside dimension for this was a little smaller than advertised. My magazines should have fit inside, but were about 1/8"" too wide. Essentially worthless for me."
4,very good pan,"have been wanting this pan for a while. a last-minute need prompted the order. one of the two pans i bought was not welded together well at one of the top corners. it didn't ""look"" pretty and the cake batter doesn't need to fill that high, but the overall pan did a great job...perfectly straight edges and corners."
1,WILL THEY EVER LEARN,"Here we go again. A college professor invites a bunch of his students to spend a weekend at his cabin for a bit of R&R.; Naturally the cabin is in the woods in the middle of nowhere and a ski-masked parka wearing killer soon begins slicing and dicing the students one by one. They have a van but once they discover a couple of their friends slaughtered in the house do these genius' run for the van and take off. Of course not-instead they stand around and argue and act terrified-they argue some more-then they start accusing each other of being the killer-then they argue some more then someone suggests ""let's get outta here"". By that time the killer has tampered with the van and they ain't going nowhere.The explanation for the gory weekend has a bit of a twist but it's still baloney. And if you like baloney this may be the movie for you...but you have been warned."
1,Silent scream,"This is the worst film we have ever seen by far. The acting was awful and the storyline pretty rubbish. The killer was beaten, kicked and even shot but still ran about as if he felt no pain, in fact he just won't die!! This is cheese at it's best. very disappointed indeed. The best part of this film was when it finished."
2,Better cover than movie.,"Some of the worst acting and most unattractive actors you will probably ever see in a straight-to-dvd movie. BUT the plot has a neat twist at the end, too bad it takes forever and a day to get there. Tries very hard to be a mix of Scream, American Pie and Urban Legend."

1,Not weatherproof!,This antenna is not weatherproof it will not resist rain and wind. The pc board is not sealed at any level. The signal elements are open at the sides and bottom and will not prevent rain from entering the center case and destroying the pc. This is another China made product underwritten by a USA company for profit not value!
2,not an outdoor antenna,"I purchased this antenna and it worked a little better than the rabbit ears. I put it outside on the covered patio. It stopped working recently. It got moisture inside the antenna. The circuit board was corroded and very wet. The housing has no water resistance seals. If you want to put it outside (under an eve) as suggested by the company don't unless the area is dry. Otherwise, it is an indoor only antenna."
4,Stops snoring as advertised,Have been using snorenz for a couple of days now. Satisfied with product. Need to see how it does in long run.
3,Works fine,Bought this product from Medgen's website. Works fine and keeps snoring down until wake up. Just need to make sure not to wake up midnight for any reason. Overall Not a bad solution for snoring
3,Kool Keith was not involved!,"This has NOTHING to do with the orignal, it is only the same in name alone.Keith had no part in this album, basically he had his voice recorded, then some random DJ's mixed that to some beats and called it Dr. Octagon II for sales purposes of course.All in all it ain't too bad, it just ain't legit, so save your cash and boot leg this one."
3,Vicki and Randy Weaver,"I enjoyed the book. It kept my interest. Maybe a little long. Viki Weaver's father influenced Vicki in a bad way. He started this ball rolling, but the government was in the wrong."
3,Good history,This was a fairly unbiased story or the events leading up to and during Ruby Ridge. Although the author did not interview all of the players and some of the information seemed to come from newspaper articles it did give a decent account of what happened.
2,[Another misinformed author who thinks he knows it all!],"Mr Walter tries to come across like heis concerned with the Weaver's but hisdimwitted 'right-wing' PresidentialCandidate, Bo Gritz', remark gives himaway. Bo was the Populist Party's candi-date, and the Populist Party is NOT ri-'ght-wing. Populism is of the Far Middleof the political spectrum. Wake up, Walt!"
2,boring read,It started after the killings. It was hard to follow. Then the story went back to describe the characters. When the seige was underway I found the details of the law men were not needed. Such as their hair styles.....I didn't finish the book. I read the captions under the pictures and was able to know how it turned out.
1,double breasted raincoat,"This raincoatwas did not fit well and was much larger than a regular 44. I did not like the design or fabric. It was also very heavy in weight. The good news is that the item was returned without question and full refund, however I had to pay for UPS shipping. Banks should be like Zappo and cover the shipping both ways."
2,Bad fit,"The coat is cut much too big, it ft nothing like it does in the picture. I consider myself a fairly average sized person 5ft 11in tall 180lb. 42in chest 32 in waist. I got a 40R because I wanted a little tighter fit. It looked terrible. The sleeves were much to wide the chest was closer to a 50 than a 40 and when I tried to cinch the waist to improve the look, it was comical. The only way I could see this coat looking good is if your waist is somewhere in the 40-50in rage and a chest that large is needed to give you an impression of a waist. On top of that the bottom was about 4 inches off the ground, taking a few steps in this ridiculously over-sized coat could not be done without tripping over my feet. After reading these reviews I can't help but wonder if I received a mislabeled product.It got two stars instead of one because it was very effective against the rain and quite warm."
4,Exactly as described,"Coat arrived in a timely fashion, well wrapped, and exactly as described. The size was correct and it looks good. Worth the price; I'd buy it again."
2,Pretty flimsy,"I did not really like the feel of this one. Seemed very cheap. I have had many of these kinds of pillows before, but this one seemed pretty bad. I would not recommend this product."
1,Cheap,"Pillow is cheaply made and flimsy. Anyone considering this over a tempurpedic don't waste your time or money. There is no comparison, I wasted $30.00 I could have put towards a good pillow. This pillow is soft and doesn't provide support like a real memoryfoam pillow. Would never buy again nor urge anyone else to."
3,"Decent pillow, just wasn't a fan of it myself","I didn't like how it was a harder composition, but I think most of these type of pillows have that same consistency -- I like a nice fluffy pillow because I move around a lot, and a hard pillow makes it annoying to move around... it does surround your head nicely if you don't move your head often, and is not for people who like to sleep on sides or stomach in my opinion. I only found it very comfortable when lying on my back, which is supposedly better for you, so if you are trying to learn to sleep on your back, this pillow may help."
1,Can't use it.,This was really firm. It requires effort to change your sleeping position. It's now in the guest room to discourage anyone from overstaying his or her welcome.
2,Srone pillow,"If you like a stone pillow, you'll love the Orthro-Therapy pillow. Though. you might not want to indulge in a pillow fight with it."
4,some assembly required,"This tackle box is impressive considering the price of purchase. It is multi-layered, and seals so that nothing can become mixed from one section to another. It does take a little time to put together initially, but the quality of the finished product is top notch."
4,Great utility box!,"Purchased this box as a small tool/parts kit. As usual Plano does a nice job of both dividing the box and giving you customizable storage, making their boxes ideal for not only fishermen but hobby enthusiasts and alike. I would definitely recommend this box for anyone looking for compact and transportable storage."
1,Very Disappointed,"Read the entire manual & set the clock to my area zone. No matter how many times I set the clock, it does not synchronize with my area zone. Set the motion sensor code, the sensor backlight in the clock never work either. Send the clock back to seller a week ago, do not have response yet."
4,Excellent product - just need time to spend with it.,"Bought this product as we needed an 'atomic clock' with a lit background to replace one that broke.We are not technophobes - and I consider myself somewhat up to date on the latest gadgets. But it took a lot of reading of the manual and a good day to figure out how it works. Usually these type of clocks are easy to figure out - not this one.However, once we did get it set up .... wonderful. Great product and would recommend it. It does everything it say it does - and the time (temperature, etc.) can be read in daylight and dark from a good distance."
4,Great Price,"We have been buying a lot of Alum lately for use in our play dough recipe. It came in granular form, but I just boiled it into the water before using for the recipe.Thank you for the good quality and priceI actually called Barry Farm about this product (questioning the granuals-not how it comes in the grocery store lol) The owner got back to me so quickly and was very knowlegable about his product."
5,Bought this to make Crystals,"I got it last night, and was excited. Just wanted to make some crystals, now first I boiled the alum in the water on the stove, that created a goo-y substance that was pretty fun. Didn't work for what I needed it for but it was entertaining, then I desolved it in hot water off the stove, much better (But not the cool goo-y thingie). Excited to see the Crystals I can get out of this stuff. Thank you!"
1,Stay away from Barry Farm!,"I had ordered this product and another item from Barry Farm thru Amazon. When I ordered this product from them, it stated the item was in stock. After two weeks, I emailed them asking about the status of my order. My emails were never answered. I cancelled my order thru Amazon. I never received any info from Barry Farm as to why my order wasn't shipped as contracted. From what it appears now, they are out of stock. I can understand this, but they won't communicate this to the buyer. Never again Barry Farm."
5,got item quick,I got this item quick and it was what I expected. I would use this seller again if needed. I could not find this item at my local grocery and much needed to make my childs play dough
5,Great Product and Great Delivery,"I purchased 3 pounds of Alum for tanning hides. My boyfriend and I just started learning how to do home tanning. We use Alum and pickling salt. The first batch we bought the small containers from the store which cost alot of money. I started searching online for cheaper alternatives. I found this post and gave it a try. The furs turned out great. It was packaged with a strong plastic and protected so no alum was lost in shipping. I just bought 10 more pounds to do more deer,rabbit, and squirrel hides. I'm so excited I found a great way to purchase my alum and continue my tanning. I highly recommend this product and the sender! Thank you so much!"
1,I did not like this book at all.,I just did not like this book at all. Children should not be having parliments. What foolishness this all was. All it does is prove the point that children cannot and should not rule. They are imature! The ending was bad too. I hate books with bad endings. Don't waste your money like I did.
5,WORKS GREAT,"This cloth is very well made, works great on my firearms and knives, very happy with purchase will buy again."
1,not good,"Ty Sullivan thinks he can get away with dating three girls at the same time while letting them think he's being faithful. Ty gets away with this until he starts exchanging valentines with a girl named Amy in Shadyside Cemetery. Amy sounds hot, but she's also jealous. And when Ty continues to see his other girlfriends, Amy begins threatening them. Ty must find out the truth about Amy before it's too late for all of them! ,Book lacked something and the ending was not hwat I expected."
5,The best dang book evar!!,"I think this is 1 of the world's best books ever!!!Anyway, If you really want a scary but romance story you've picked the right book!"
3,ok,provides some good insight some parts i have found a little difficult to understand. a little disappointed because I was hoping it would be written for the average person trying to get a better understanding
1,IVP Background commentary,"The will be differents of opinions, but this commentary points the scriptures toward Pagan doctorine. There is more pointing toward the pagan background than Christianity."
4,Good,I bought two of these as a gift for a self-employed friend. They work great and last for several years.
1,Uneven printing,"Two typefaces were used in my Officemate Stamp. The month and year are of one and the date another. This wouldn't bother me except that the thickness of the rubber under the typefaces is of a different thickness. The month and year are thicker and therefore stand up more. If you give a quick stamp with the device, the month and year show up fine but it is hard to see the date. One must press down hard to get the date to print. This usually leaves a smudge around the month and year.I will replace this aggravating device as soon as I can get to a store where I can examine a replacement before buying."
2,Faulty audio,"Although music selection is excellent,the audio quality is the same as if you were hearing it through a phonograph"
4,"Long on Fact, Short on Synthesis","Anyone who has noted the curious similarity of symbols and the unique ritual of sand paintings practiced by both Tibetan Buddhists and the Navajo people will welcome this ambitious book by Peter Gold. Going into the ""nuts and bolts"" detail of both religious systems, Gold scoops up copious facts, quotes, maps, photos, diagrams and drawings from both cultures and loosely organizes them into four sections: Awakening, Balancing, Centering and Becoming. Not a dry academic study, nor a new age self-help book, The Circle of the Spirit hits home the non-dualistic nature of both systems. What is lacking, or what I dearly missed, was a synthesis or summing up of why these sister cultures could or would be so much in synch despite the time and miles between them."
2,Sand painting,This book was much too detailed for what I wanted. I expected more pictures of sand paintings but it was mostly text. Not appropriate for elementary students.
3,neat idea but cats don't use it,"This is a neat little thing, but none of my four cats will use it! I've had it two months now and am probably going to give it away. It was worth a try."
2,Flavorless,"These have the same basic shape and consistency of a Cheeto, so they are nicely crunchy, but aren't hot or spicy. In fact, they don't have much flavor at all."
5,I am pleased,"I dont know how to tell expiration dates on cologne but I do feel this might be near the end of its life when received, I very much like the product and use it so much, I can not smell it, but constantly get compliments from women and men that it smells good."
5,Paul Sebastian De Luxe Splash,I love the scent- masculine but not overpowering! I plan to order the atomizer next for my grandson.I think that I shall use it too!
5,Review of Paul Sebastian,I have been a long-time user of Paul Sebastian men's products. This de luxe splashis as good as the other Paul Sebastian products I have used. Amazon's price wasvery reasonable for this product.
1,Poor Quality Cologne,"Paul Sebastian By Paul Sebastian For Men, Cologne (8 Ounces)I have been using PS Cologne for over 20 years. I recently ordered some from Amazon when I noticed their discounted price.The cologne arrived either over its expiration date or after it was exposed to extreme temperatures.There was a faint scent overpowered by an alcohol odor.Amazon credited my card immediately without question. Thank you Amazon. No thanks to the supplier."
1,not much smell,I should have known it was to good to be true.It does not smell like paul sebastian cologne at all and it only last a few seconds not worth the money.PAUL SEBASTIAN For Men By PAUL SEBASTIAN fragrance set
1,Paul Sebastian Cologne Order,This product was supposed to come from a company. The product was supposed to be new. Instead it came from an individual. The package was not sealed with cellophane as new Paul Sebastian products are packaged. The box containing the bottle of cologne was well used.I suspect the cologne was an item from someone's home and was watered down as the fragrance was weak. I began using Paul Sebastian in the 90s but I will buy the product in a store from now on.I will not use this product since it has been compromised. I will consider the money spent for this product wasted. I would return it but don't want to waste more money in shipping cost.
2,Genuine Product or Not??,"Purchased 8.0 oz. bottle of Paul Sebastian cologne. Cannot determine if it's real or just a cheap immitation. Based on aroma compared to remains of bottle purchased at a department store, the new bottle just doesn't smell the same. Don't know how to verify authenticity of the product purchased on Amazon."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,The UPS driver where I use to work always had a great smelling cologne on. I asked him what he wore and he said Paul Sebastian. Maybe he used a different version but it definitely didn't smell like this. This stuff smells like something you'd buy at walgreens...in my opinion!
4,men's cologne,"Excellent product; been using it for years. It's a nice, clean scent. I wear it almost everyday and any time of day even though it's suggested you wear it in the evening. Get lots of compliments. I only wish I would had realized this was not a spray cologne which is really what I wanted."
1,BEWARE NOT FOR MEN OF AGE 34 AND BELOW,"THIS IS NOT A GOOD COLOGNE AT ALL I MUST SAY THAT THIS COLOGNE IS AIMED FOR OLD MEN LIKE 60 OR SO I DON'T EVEN RECOMMEND OLD MEN TO BUY IT ITS HORRIBLE GOOD THING I TOOK A WHIFF OF IT AT A DEPARTMENT STORE BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS. I HAD IT ON MY WISH LIST FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS BUT CLEARLY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE HONEST REVIEWS, OR THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WROTE THE REVIEWS ARE OF AGE. AGAIN I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS TO A YOUNGER CROWD OR EVEN A MIDDLE AGE CROWD."
4,manly scent,"Paul S is one one my old time favorites, a little strong on the patchuli smell, but i cut it another scent to make it milder. Great price on a great cologne."
4,So nice.,"A warm, musky and citrus-y smell. Reminds me of my youth: Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, Tonio K., KROQ radio in LA (when it was cool - admittedly a L - O - N - G time ago)."
5,PS colone,"Been using it for years,the price is great, the fragance is very subtle and the woman swoon What elese can I say"
2,Pictures misleading...,"I purchased this item thinking it has both red and green Xertube as shown in the picture, but once it's arrived, it's a red Xertube and a green Xering...I know I should have read the product description, but that's not the point... I only use the red Xertube and the product works great and I love it. I just give it 2 stars because I don't use the green Xering and the picture advertised was misleading."
4,Good for Price,"Its a good product for its price. Simple as that. It has not broken on me, and serves its purpose."
5,A Must-Have,"I absolutely love the M-station Stereo Tower. I wanted to get rid of my massive stereo speakers, but could not find anything small that had the same sound quality, until I heard the M-station."
5,"Cute, creative decision making tool!","This is another of American Girl's valuable series of books to help our daughters get through the trials and tribulations of growing up with a little more fun along the way.Cute illustrations underscore family matters, decision making and other issues that young readers face every day. The world is changing every day, and challenges can become comples even for tweens. No matter what those issues might be, this book is a good start to making good choices and a gateway to family discussion.What Would You Do? is bound to become a favorite in your family library, and I highly recommend it."
4,Girl Book,Add this to your young lady's library today! This book is great to read together and fosters disussing best ways to handle situations that occur in the teen life. There are always more than one road to get to the castle...so help your daughter see options in choosing the right road for her in what could be major problems.
3,Not enough discussion included,"This was a great concept for a book, but I don't think it lived up to its potential. My daughter (age 9) skimmed through it in just a few minutes and didn't really want to ""take"" the quizzes. I think a bit more discussion around the ""situations"" would have been helpful to guide her reading."
5,These books are Fab!,"I purchase American Girl books for my friends 11 year old daughter frequently and they are wonderful! They are cute, easy to read and contain extremely good age-appropriate advice. I wish they had these types of books when I was her age! She enjoys the books very much and she always seems to look forward to receiving the next book, to add to her collection. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this series!"
5,not what you would expect,"I had only known Chumbawamba for the song ""Tubthumping."" Then I heard a selection from ""A Singsong and a Scrap"" on Folk Alley. It was a combination of Belle and Sebastian and Fairport Convention. I ordered the CD and haven't stopped playing it since it arrived. Wonderful a capella harmonies, clever songs with a labor union theme, and lively upbeat melodies. Who knew? Now, I do!"
5,Saved my life!,"I was a grad student in Physics when I read this beautiful little book. After studying QM for three years (2 years undergrad and 1 year grad), I knew all the rules but the subject still made no sense to me. Gillespie's short book is a model of clarity, explaining the big ideas, explaining what is a assumed (postulate) and what is derived (theorem), and tying the diverse threads of this subject into a beautiful and powerful whole. I will be forever grateful to this book, because after reading it, QM made sense and I knew I could become a physicist."
5,Insightful and approachable,"Wanting to understand QM better (in the mathematical sense) I have looked at a number of introductory texts and Gillespie's work stands out for me. He begins by developing a comparison of vectors in Euclidean and Hilbert spaces. This made the subject much more approachable for me. He does not use Dirac notation, which reduced the new notation I needed to understand. I have also found it more difficult to consider mixed states and use Dirac notation. If you are looking for a clear mathematical understanding of non-relativistic QM, try this book."
2,Disappointing try at filling a real need.,"Was Daniel Gillespie trying to convince himself of the validity of quantum mechanics (QM) by writing this book? I don't know, but the result fell short. The early sections on classical mechanics and probability are necessary, brief, good (though conditional probabilities should have been discussed), but the main QM exposition has many faults: (1) sticks to wave functions in position representation instead of using Dirac notation; (2)should feature graphical and matrix ideas from linear algebra, and (of course!) the spectral theorem; and (3) writing is verbose, too much adumbration (foreshadowing) and summarizing. There is a real need for a book covering this ground, for interested neophytes, but this one isn't good enough at the job. Likely a treatment using Kronecker product space of position and spin-1/2, then doing most calculations with the latter, would work out better."
3,experiencia con el swatch,muy buen reloj lo recomiendo ampliamente las funciones de los piñones son excelentes la correa de muy buen materias y el reloj en si es muy bueno y por un precio adsesible...
5,Yummy!,This tea is wonderful for ice tea. I make a big jug of sun tea using 3 bags of green tea and three bags of Stash caramel tea. Everyone loves it!
4,Stash Tea,"Good tea, better price than if you actually order from their web site, however you have to order these in boxes of 6 each which is a bit much volume wise for me."
2,Not my cup of tea!,"This tea taste like neither caramel or creme. It definitely has a more nutty flavor. It is also bitter, even after the addition of cream.Very disappointing, as Stash teas are usually excellent."
4,"Not That ""New"" But Very Good","Kenny Drew'sUndercurrent(see my review) is one of my favorite lesser-known Blue Note albums, but before the pianist rejoined the label in 1960 (he also made some sides in the early 50s for them), he recorded several sessions for Riverside. ""This Is New"" collects two of those dates -- the first three tracks hail from a March 28, 1957 quintet session featuring Donald Byrd, Hank Mobley, Wilbur Ware and drummer G.T. Hogan, while the remaining selections are from a week later on April 3rd, this time as a quartet with everyone above except Mobley. Contrary to the title, there isn't much ""new"" about this disc, though it is a solid hard bop outing. With this title going out-of-print like so many OJC CDs, interested parties should get ""This Is New"" before it gets old and dies."
5,A True Classic,"Third Man is a classic film in every sense. It challenges on every level; a superb mystery with incredible visual and audio layers that explore the issues of the post-war period. Set in a divided Vienna after WWII, the story begins with the death of Welles just as an old friend arrives. Unraveling the mysterious circumstances of that death in the barely-controled chaos of Vienna, the hero is faced with some unpleasant truths: greed, politics and betrayal."
4,the third man returns,"'The third man"" is a classic movie of the highest order. This is loosely based on that movie. This dvd collects some of this pretty good show. I thought the plots were engaging and the production values were what you would expect from a early 60's tv show. It's black and white and has the excellent actors Michael Rennie and Jonathon Harris as its leads. The prints are very watchable but full of artifacts and lines in some areas so this is by no means from the master prints. But then it's a cheap set and is very cold war in feel. It's worth getting some vintage tv and such a low price because this show is a decent show that deserves not to be forgotten."
3,Only from Timeless do you get this,"First off, don't expect superb quality. The series went into the public domain and Timeless obviously used whatever prints they could find. The quality is not remastered or digitally restored. But it isn't bad for the price so unless you are a nit-picker, you won't be disappointed. Michael Rennie is no Orson Welles and for that matter, do not expect something like the Carol Reed movie. This was a cheap rip-off series from the motion picture. It ran more than a season so it did decent. But ten half-hour episodes for the price is not bad."
1,Very Dated,"I was curious to see how The Third Man series made for TV had travelled with time. I remember enjoying it as a teenager in the 1960s. The sad answer is not very well. The plots are pathetically thin and most of the acting wooden and the characters not very credible. As I watched this time around, I realised what had attracted me all those years ago. It was the romance of flying to what then looked like exotic and exciting settings in far away places; London, Rome, Paris, New York etc. These locations were fairly inaccessible to most people then; not true anymore. The allure has gone."
3,molly,I like the book because it was funni and it have a lot of stuff . and it can happend to a normal kid .and because she is olways in trouble and they parent's dont care .and because she is in middle school.the best par of the book is when they have a food fight and she gets in trouble and thas way she is in big trouble and the worst think is in class of french and she is not in action every day.jose
2,Faulty audio,Music selection is excellent but audio quality is the same as if you were hearing it from phonograph
4,"5-star playing, 3-star DVD","The playing is what you'd expect of Kogan, which is jaw dropping. I was disappointed with a couple of aspects of the production. First of all, though the DVD clearly indicates a 60 minute running time, it's only a 47 minute program, and part of it is Kogan providing only marginally insightful introductions to each piece. So you've only got about 40 minutes of music here. Second, at least a few of the tracks (though not all) play slightly too fast, as evidenced for instance by the FAE sonata which sounds a half step sharp.Overall this disc is definitely worth owning for the Kogan enthusiast. The playing is stunning and the camera-work, though a little distracting at times, still gives you some very nice looks at Kogan's impeccable technique. The short program and odd playback speed make it not a GREAT value at $18 though."
3,Book is OK,"I was a little disappointed in the amount of garden clay pot projects. Projects in the book were too small and too many ""crafty"" adornments for what I was looking for. I can adapt some of the ideas but for me the book in general was disappointing."
5,Wonderful book!,"We got a book similar to this at the library, went to the store & boughtpots for several projects. We knew we needed the book longer thanthe library would allow, so we looked online & saw this one also.The book arrived safe & sound, in excellent condition and quickly.Thank you."
1,Poorly performing cleaner,I tried this product to clean out a badly clogged garbage disposal. The product was ineffective. I noticed no difference at all in the extent of the clog.
4,Great CD,"This CD is not as great as their first two, but nevertheless has lots of upbeat contemporary songs. It has a lot of nice 'island' music for those who are away from the islands and homesick or if you just want a taste of some contemporary, popular island music."
5,The Quackenbush Family in America,"This gentleman has done such thorough research, it is a wonderful genealogy of the family clear back before they came to America and forward through centuries!"
1,Don't waste your time and money.,"I started with the speaker packs. I saw very little result. Then dynamat said, well you really need to do the whole door, so I did. $400 later, I still have as much road noise as before and I covered my entire door frame on all 4 doors.Don't buy in to the hype. I know it sounds good, but the people who got results are just idiots who believe everything the are told. ""Miller lite is good beer, isn't it Johnny? See the pretty women on TV, you'll get them too if you drink Miller Lite."" ""Duh... Yes... lite beer is good.."""
4,keeps the bugs away!,"I love burt's bees! This stuff works well, although a little oily. BUT I don't get bit so it must be working! It smells a little medicinal but I kinda like it. I would buy it again."
3,Power brick/amp gets very hot,"Everyone has already said what needs to be said about these speakers--they sound pretty good. I have two gripes though. 1) Very unstable. I have dropped mine numerous times from the slightest bump. I work on a motorized desk, so the light wobble of moving the desk up/down sends them to the floor. I've had to use miniature c-clamps to fix them onto my desk. 2) The combined power brick/amp gets VERY hot. I've always had it out of the way in an open shelf, so I never paid much attention to them. I had a coiled-up, unused USB cable sitting on top of the box and it melted into the plastic. The box now has a permanent circle grooved in. The USB cable is fine, it was the box that melted--if I had anything of significant weight on top of the box, it would have been swallowed up by the plastic, creating a fire hazard."
3,not bad,"I expected more...but for the price they are ok. When you pump the volume they have a terrible bass, only good for medium volume."
5,Absolutely Love These!,"I was given these same speakers as a gift a few years ago. Sadly, one speaker recently crapped out so I decided to order the exact same ones because the sound on these puppies is amazing! I received them within just a few days, and they work perfectly. Heck I still use the one speaker from my old set because even just one is loud enough. Trust me, you won't be disappointed with these!"
2,Don't buy it,"I give this three strikes. 1) the bulky ""power brick"" mentioned by others. This would make portability a bear and if you don't need portability buy at least a 2.1 system! 2) Weak preamp. Some of my tracks simply will not play at useable levels because the normalized sound levels are too low for decent playback. 3) Very low sound levels before distortion!!!I was impressed by the passive radiator idea, many of the finest high end systems use this approach to try to achieve the low end and punch of a ported system while preserving the tightness and upper bass range clarity of a sealed system. These speakers do acieve fantastic sounds - but only at low listening levels, and with loud tracks. They'd work in a hotel room, that's about it. I hope Philips re-does this speaker & gets it right!I'll be choosing between the Klipsch ProMedia Ultra 2.0 and the Bose Companion 2 Series II 2.0, both at $99. Why pay less for use-less???"
2,Highly over rated,"I usually won't bag on a product, but these speakers are highly over rated they sound ok, but they are not very loud at all. I've had louder cheap speaker systems then these that sound better. There not very portable. The power supply is a huge brick. The way people rave about these speaker you would think there great speakers there not avoid them."
4,Decent for the money,"I split a bunch of oak with this unit, but it would not split any unseasoned wood. It's too wet. I stacked my unseasoned oak away and will wait until next season to spilt it. Otherwise, I had no problem splitting big rounds (12 to 15 inches) of seasoned oak.Hala"
2,Needs some design work!,"Packaging was not adequate for UPS shipping! I returned the first damaged spliiter for replacement. The second was also damaged, but I chose to keep it and repair the bent and broken parts myself. The log splitter has sufficient power for most small to medium size logs. The design of the shuttle and wedge leave much to be desired. The shuttle does not travel far enough to completely split even the smallest logs. After manufacturing a larger, add-on wedge, and extending the reach of the shuttle (using a 4""x4"" block) the splitter will work on most small to medium logs. Definitely not for large logs!!!"
3,"broken wheel, busted box, cracked paint","The box was broken, one wheel was busted and the paint on the ""fenders"" is cracked. It seems to work fine though. I feel like Amnazon knew the condition when they shipped it and should have told me and offered a discount. I did get free shipping so that was nice. Allan in CT"
1,DOA,Received the log splitter in good condition. No damage to splitter or box. Took splitter out of packaging and read directions. Plugged the splitter in and pushed the power button. got a hum and tripped the breaker. Repeated process several times and no still tripped unit breaker. The motor is either siezed or not installed properly.Called McCulloch customer service and they requested that I take it to a wrrantee certified repair shop. There are only 2 in the DFW area. Imagine 7 million people in the surrounding area and only 2 shops. the first one I called did not work on electric motors. The other shop was 2 hours away.
2,Packaging nightmare,"We tried two of these, and it is probably bad to rate them low, but we never got to use either one. The packaging of the product is HORRIBLE and both times the box was completely ripped apart on arrival and the splitter was damaged beyond repair. Don't know if the splitter is any good or not, but the packaging in very inadequate. On the other hand, Amazon Customer service was brilliant both times and picked up the splitters and refunded our money....no questions asked. Amazon is a great company. This product, however, is not packaged up to their standards."
2,Shipping damage...,"The log splitter was left on my door step in a box that looked like it have been run over by a train. I could not even pick it up because the box was in completely crushed. After I got the pieces in the house, I found there was no actual damage to the actual splitter. When I plugged it in and hit the button the motor would not spin the the breaker tripped. I tried this 4 or 5 times with no luck. I then took the shroud off of the motor and turned it by hand. This did the trick and I finally the thing working. The motor and/or pump appears to be be very cheap, with very little startign torque.I haven't split anything yet,and I doubt it will hold up for 1 season..."
4,Educational Psychology,This is my text book for my PSE 6670 class at Troy Univ. I think this is an excellent book for this class. It is well organized and easy to read and it has all kinds of helpful points of interest areas for review. Good book for the class.
4,Was as described.,"It was used, though I wish it wasn't so much, but it was the cheapest of the choices. It came as described with highlighting, but nothing too bad. I was pleased with the product and the speed and accuracy."
1,Never Came,"There was a problem with this purchase and after 20 days of waiting for it to arrive, I was informed that I would not receive the book at all. My refund didn't come until 25 days after the original purchase."
3,Larger Photos Please!,This calender was not designed for the fan who likes large photos of the crew. I would have preferred a background to the photos; which are smaller than ever. The Voyager calender incorporated a designer background to each monthly photo. Too much white space; is the first comment I'd have about this edition. Too plain and ordinary. I wish I were the editor on this one; cause' it would have went back to the edit mode on the computer.
4,A Must-Have for Every Depeche Fan,"This is a highly informative book starting from the very beginning, showing the evolution of the band. Highlights include quotes from band members and friends, giving both positive and negative comments on the progress of Depeche Mode. Malins also shows the tensions between band members and problems they faced, such as drug addiction, breakdowns, and heavy drinking. While this book is extremely informative, Malins tends to devote a little too much attention to David's drug problems."
2,For hardcare fans only,"More a collection of quotes arranged neatly in chronological order than a biography, Black Celebration provides an adequate but incomplete account of the history of Depeche Mode. Personally, I expected a lot more in terms of insight to the dynamics of the band and psychology of the individual band members. Also disappointing is the dull writing style of Malins, and the poor editing. Perhaps the only redeeming feature is the collection of beautiful colour photos."
2,"Great idea, bought it! Missing some major concepts.","I bought the book because I thought it was going to be ""the solution"" for our course: an e-book that students didn't have to lug around, containing all the basic concepts that I could supplement, if need be. But the book doesn't say very much about periodic motion. It doesn't mention pendulums (what Physics book doesn't have the pendulum equation?, for example, or oscillations of a spring.(Luckily, it DOES mention the spring force and constant.) It could use planetary motion as another example of periodic motion -- it could mention ""Simple Harmonic Motion"", but doesn't!So I'll continue my search. Most publishing house textbooks contain WAY more information than is needed by students. I was hoping this one would offer enough information, and it didn't. I hope a new edition will!"
4,AWESOME,"This book is SUPERB on the topics it does contain. It studies mechanics, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics and heat, and nuclear/atomic physics. All of these topics are written well and explained clearly; like I said, it's very good on the topics it DOES contain. The only problem I've found with this book is that it doesn't include anything on Relativity or Quantum Mechanics. Yes, it does go in depth about light, photons, and the wave-particle duality of light. Very helpful overall in the basics, but it doesn't go into the really advanced topics. I can't tell if this was meant for College Physics or high-school physics........either way, the explanations were great and it is, really, a great book. If you're taking physics on any level, get this book."
5,Excellent.,"I read the thriller and the grammar was fine. The story is exciting, with more twists and turns than a Clancy yarn. I love Alex Seacourt, Davis' hero with a heart. Alex is smart, intelligent and the next James Bond.With a movie in the works and possible stars such as Mark Wahlberg, Keanu Reeves and Brad Pitt in the mill--I'd give Doomsday Kiss two thumbs up!"
4,Written very well,"I enjoyed it and wished that it laster longer. Alex Seacourt is such an ""unlikely hero"" that you really root for him. He's not superman -- just a normal guy doing great stuff."
1,"Long, prolix and rambling","I listened to this book on tape, and only continued listening because the writing was so bad, it was funny. I had a good time sharing the overwrought phrases with my children; to wit, ""Like a felled 2,000 year-old redwood, he toppled to the ground."" Or the phrase that went something like this: ""The bullets ripped into his brain like a stick into an overstuffed pinata."" At one point, he said something about panic running all over the airport.(?)Dr. Davis, I can only hope that your patient chart notes reflect more clear and concise observations than the thing you call your ""novel""."
4,Great movie!,The movie arrived early. The movie is a classic! Worth a watch. A great medical drama! For the price this movie was a steal!
1,Pretty Bad,This DVD was AWFUL! I started watching it and was Not impressed at all. It was too confusing and I could keep track of what was supposed to be going on. It didn't seem to have any real story line. I ended up only watching about 10 minutes of it and then basically throwing it away.
3,Hawkwind - 'Family Tree' (Voiceprint),"'Family Tree' more or less serves the same purpose that the couple of 'Friends & Relations' compilation CD's have. To bring you otherwise hard (often impossible) to find tracks by solo members of Hawkwind or spin-off bands. Best cuts here are the 1979 live Hawkwind snippet of ""Motorway City"" and the Paradog's (guitarist Jerry Richard's side project) ""Noctis Labyrinthus"". Other decent tracks would be the couple of Dave Brock solo recordings ""The Auctioneer"" and ""Voice Inside My Head"", which are okay. Also,the later day Brock /Davey /Chadwick penned ""Only Time Will Tell"" isn't bad. Pretty much for completists."
1,The author needs to do his research,"This book is TRYING to organize well the history of musical theatre, but he gets all jumbled where he talks about 1999 and then moves back to 1984 and then goes to 1997, and you just wonder where he is taking you, and you can easily get confused. He also made some false claims, especially about RENT, where he said that the creator died of AIDS on the night of the first preview. Johnathan Larson did not die of AIDS, and it was the opening night of the NYTW try out. He also makes vague generalizations of the plot and everything of different musicals, and he just isnt complete where he should have been, and instead wastes alot of the time with just boring pointless BLAH. If you want a good musical theatre book, don't look here."
1,Jonathan Larson,"I just wanted to clear something up about a wonderful role model Jonathan Larson who created RENT. This book stated that he died of aids. Get your facts strait! After a visit to the hospital complaining of chest pains, he had been given an all-clear from the doctors. But then, a few days later, he suddenly died, at the age of 35, from an aortic aneurysm. It was the evening of the dress rehearsal. If you are going to write a book, maybe you should get your information correct."
4,This record is kicking my can!,This record is just a joy to listen to. Mostly because they're covering almost 40 years of pop music so deftly that you don't even notice. If you listen it's all in there. From the Beatles to the Beach Boys on down they've nicked everyone but they don't beat the hell out of YOU for it. It's also recorded BEAUTIFULLY. It's just a good time for me whenever it's on.
5,A Step Beyond,"As a longtime Qs fan, I'm thrilled to see the end of the band's ""wilderness years"" with the arrival of this new disc. And it's great to see that they haven't spent the years since their last release vegetating. Royal Academy is a marked departure from their Athens/New Wave roots, and it works wonderfully. The Qs are the last band I would have expected Indianesque raga-rock from, but in this case I'm quite glad to have my expectations confounded. Not that there aren't more traditional moments to latch onto: My particular favorite is the gorgeous ""Light Arriving Soon"". My only regret is that Anne Richmond Boston rejoined the group only after most of the tracks were laid down and so gets a chance to shine only on some backing vocals. I trust that we won't have to wait 10 years for the next release, and that she will move back up front to share the leads again."
2,TJ and The Cats,"This book is a great book for 6-8 year olds but if your older that that forget about it!! i dont know how it could be nominated as a Silver Birch book (for grades 4-6)!!! It has no chance of winning because there are pleanty of better books out there, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOUR KID/YOU IS OVER 8! big waste of money!!!"
5,A much better laptop bag!,"I went from a standard laptop case from IBM to this backpack and I couldn't be happier. My T20 fits fine in the padded slot for the laptop and I still have lots of room for accessories and books, etc. It is also so much more convienient to carry around on the train to work than the bulky IBM case. Good construction and pretty good looking too!"
4,VERY BEAUTIFUL CARDS AND TRUE CHRISTMAS CARDS!,I love these cards. I love a lot o Laurel Ink's products. These are rather old fashioned looking which is what attracted the card to me. I received many compliments from people I sent them to. I would definitely buy them again.
3,"Good, Could Have Been Better!","This was an ok book about Britney. It had cool pics, and I liked the quizzes. It really is just another biography of Brit. It starts from when she was first born, all the way to the release of Oops...I Did It Again. I really didn't find the biography stuff that interesting since I knew most of it, and there were some errors. For example, the author says Britney's natural hair color is blond. That's not true. Her natural (underline) hair color is BROWN! Look at some pics of Britney as a kid and you'll see! Well, overall this was a good book, but for a really good Britney Spears book read Heart to Heart, the book she wrote with her mother."
2,Misleading Listing - Doesn't include parts shown,"I purchased this installation kit to go with a Panasonic inline fan. This listing title is ""Installation Kit"" and it shows the backdraft damper and cable-ties as well as the 4"" grille. However, the kit **DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BACKDRAFT DAMPER**, although it is shown in the photo and implied in the title. This is **NOT** really the true installation kit, it is only the 4"" inlet grille.Researching after receiving this incomplete kit, it seems Panasonic does sell a full installation kit, but that is the PC-NLF04S. The photo and title these guys are showing in this misleading listing really goes with that other product.To be fair, I am still giving the seller 2 stars, because it is the proper 4"" grille for the fan.But, be warned, this is NOT really the installation kit as title and picture indicate, it is ONLY for the grille. You will need to buy the backdraft damper (and cable ties) separately from a different source."
2,False Advertisement,I anticipated the product shown in the picture. No backdraft damper or ties were included. This represents poor or deceptive sales from the seller.
4,Early Printing Errors Fixed,"The errors that appeared in the early printing of this text have been corrected in the later printings that are now being made available from the publisher.This book is one of the only comprehensive classical optics textbooks at the advanced undergraduate level, and as such, fills an important niche. Practical material, such as image aberrations and radiometry, are handled here at a very accessible level, which makes the book a valuable professional reference."
3,Reasonable novelization of his movie...,"Lucas wrote the novel himself, and it was released prior to the 1977 film, which gives it a little extra credibility.Better novel than a film? No... But it would stand on its own reasonably well as a novel. Nothing special in terms of the writing, but it works well enough. You won't get much in here that isn't in the film, though it is slightly more adult. I think bones and blood went flying once or twice and he may have mentioned perspiration on a woman's skin once. Ooooooohhhh..."
4,Wave the pink flag,"Ikara Colt wears their influences on their sleeves. Certainly, postpunk stalwarts The Fall and Wire occupy places of honour in their record boxes.That being said, though, this EP is a great addition to the genre. The crunchy guitar work and subtle electronics combined with clear vocals make this a very listenable and enjoyable EP. The EP format seems to have been a very smart choice as I was left wondering by the end whether or not their sound could properly sustain a full record.All that aside though, the fifth track on the EP (May B 1 Day #2) is almost worth the price of the record alone."
1,Steve Winter: Promoter of Easily refuted heresies,"Steve Winter had all of these videos online at one point. These videos contain very poor quality bible ""studies"" that promote nothing but Winter's personal heretical beliefs. Winter holds to positions similar to the United Pentecostal Chuch and the majority of the Oneness Pentecostal movement. These doctrines are easily refuted with the Bible. I recommend ""Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity"" by Gregory A. Boyd and ""God in Three Persons"" by Carl Brumback for a complete and thorough refutation of everything brought up by Mr. Winter."
2,"Lullabies, really??","I saw all the great reviews on this CD and decided to purchase it but to be honest was a bit disappointed. Whilst nice music to listen to if you like tribal and relaxation music, I do not think this goes to the heart of my bubba as much as some of the other more traditional lullabies. If it classified as a relaxation music I would rank it much higher, but lullabies for babies?"
5,Great Bed Time Choice,"We have worn through this CD and have bought a 2nd.My boy has listened to this since he was a newborn and we never tire of the music; great choice.Believe it or not the Martha Stewart Lullaby CD compilation is a good one.And, you can never go wrong with Suzie Tallman."
2,If you like thriller authors to tell you how to believe....,"than this is the book for you.This book has terrific potential as a thriller, and has a very intriguing beginning. Unfortunately, the majority of the book is hampered by cartoonish portrayals of everyone from homosexuals to fundamentalist Christians. Plenty of offense to be taken by everybody!At one point the author, who spends several pages talking about the evils of prejudice, describes a character by using a racial epithet. These types of contradictions abound throughout this book.If you can get past the shallow characterization and moral high-handedness, the rest of the book is a fast-paced mystery that can be quite enjoyable."
1,very racist,racial language is unbelievable here. This writer uses very deroragotory words for African Americans and he didn't have to even state the character is black. Just glad it was a friend's book and didn't spend no money on this book to hear this language.
1,I don't like being lied to.,"This book was really fast paced until it slowed down to almost a complete halt! When I first picked this book up I loved it; it was like riding a lighting bolt; but about page a hundred I started realizing that all the surprises were so old and used they were like a piece of gum on the road that's been hit by every other Mac truck that goes by. By about page two hundred I saw the surprises coming so far ahead it made me feel like I was writing the book. Worse I found that the heroes's characters could be summed up as sexy but normal, plain, bland, boring huminoid robots. I got so mad I skipped to the epilogue read it. That's when I sat up in bed and said, ""That's stuuuuuupid."" I haven't finished the book and don't plan on doing so. The writer said some certain things in the book would happen, but they didn't. I'm not talking about a twist. I love twists; I'm talking about a narrative lie; and if you ask me, he cheated the reader; he cheated me!! And I'm mad!!"
4,Very enjoyable,"Although I was able to figure out whodunit, I still enjoyed it. I liked the concept of how the villain carried out his crimes. I didn't expect it to end the way it did - pleasant surprise."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The size of the book is very uncomfortable. Very small book but has a lot of pages which makes it hard to handle while reading. Some good information, but I dislike the way the book is laid out. I wouldn't buy this book if I was in an actual book store and seen it first."
1,Bad,I've had this watch 3 months the gold tone started coming off after 2 months. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the watch still works.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE,This book is one of the most important books that I have ever read. It tought me what to do not only when I am coming home alone after dark but also how to protect myself with regards to personal affairs.
2,"not so ""easy ball""","This Product was as stated ""Used"" It arrived and first thing out of the Box.. NO SOFTWARE (Explorapediea Nature for Windows)so the Drivers weren't available and the product was ""Filthy"".after cleaning up, which consisted of an entire dismantle, it worked fine.Definitely Less than I expected.But what I bought."
5,Great way to introduce a toddler to the PC for the first time!,Was given this as a gift and both my 2-year-old and 4-year-old figured it out instantly. Great idea!
3,Modern Outfits,"I love Tom Tierney's work and Sayoko, the Little Japanese Girl, is beautifully depicted along with her clothing, however, I was disappointed that half of the outfits were modern and not historical like many of the rest of the Little Girl paper dolls series from other countries. Outfits: modern-day kimono, school dress, Hanagasa festival (cover), winter outfit, party dress, playtime, school play, and martial arts costume."
1,salida,"El tiempo de entrega es muy grande, así como el cobro de envío es muy caro, porque los cobran por separado pero los envían juntos.The time of delivery is very great, as well as the collection of shipment is very expensive, because they receive them separately but they send them together."
5,AJAK Review,"Great DVD for anyone that enjoys the type of music on the DVD, I really would recommend this to a Blues Music Fan"
5,No Milk...not just for farm kids!,"I just got this book for my 2 year old. He and I have read it for 3 nights straight...he picks it out every time at bedtime. He enjoys saying along with me...""no millk"" as each page ends in that blurb. Repetition is fun for little readers, and this book is cute and funny. I recommend it for city kids and farm kids alike. :)"
4,Great for early elementary school,Our 6 year old loves this series. She can't wait for the other books to be released.
5,A good second book!,"This review is by my 7 year old niece, Tasha:This is the second rainbow magic fairy book. This time Rachel and Kirsty must save Amber the Orange Fairy from Jack Frost's goblins so she can bring color back to Fairyland with the help of her sisters.Amber was trapped in a clam shell and they had to use a magic feather to get her out.She goes back to be with her sister in the pot at the end of the rainbow. They use the shell as a bed. Bertram the frog helps but does not fit here."
5,Inspired and enjoyable,"I picked this up at a Crown Book Liquidation center and am so glad that I did. I loved this book. It reminded me first of The Alchemist, then oddly, briefly of Uri Geller. I am fascinated with the concept of parapsychology. These are four wonderful tales of simplicity but with resonance beyond their surface. I was amazed to read how the author wrote these on each of four consecutive days with an inspiration that was described as ""dreamlike"". I am adding this book to my Permanant collection and will now be seeking any other books by this writer."
3,Average for the $20 games,This game is probably one of the best games out of the chepos that come out for $20 the story is pretty good the weapons and gameplay are okthe anamition and levels/graphics are not that great the weapon firing is nothing special and weapon inventory is decentI played this game for a few hours and played it a couple of different timesSome times it can be a little addicting wanting to play it but it ended up sitting on my shelf then getting traded inIf you are in to slow paced action games this is for you but if your not like moste everyone else this game is not for you
2,Not sure it did anything!,Can't say whether it worked or not...how do you really know. It honestly didn't reassure me too much.
3,Doesn't clean - just sanitizes,I thought this cleaned AND sanitized but it doesn't. You put the pacifiers in dry and close it and the light comes on for five minutes and then goes off. Pacifiers still need to be washed separately. They look exactly the same when you take them out as they did when you put them in which makes me wonder if it really did do anything.

1,Lousy product. No educational value.,"Within 2 minutes my son figured out the ""strategy"" behind where the answer was on the card. He would take whatever the second number was in the equation and start counting from the second dot on the left hand side of the card. He'd count that many dots to find the answer. I tried it myself and it was true. What a lousy ""educational"" toy."
4,Excellent for my needs.,"I bought this remote control to control iTunes. I have my basement computer hooked-up to my stereo reciever. We use it to play all our music in the house. The only problem I had was having to run down stairs every time I wanted to skip a song. This solved the problem for me. I got a couple USB extension cables and ran then through the wall to the basement computer. Now I can control iTunes just as if I was at the computer.I havent tried any of the other features so I cant comment on those, but for my needs I think it works great. The only problem I've had ia that the buttons are pretty sensetive, so if I hold down the skip button to long it will skip a couple of song. Just push the button fast, and problem solved. I recomend this to anyone wanting to control their media player."
3,"Does what I want it to do, but could be better..","There's little things that could be better about the Streamzap remote. For one, it could be a little more customizable. You can only tell the Streamzap program which programs you want to control, but not what buttons on the remote will do what. One instance that annoys me is that you cannot use the remote to control individual volumes of programs, just the volume of Windows itself, but it will change tracks, play, pause, and stop on iTunes and Winamp, although the sensitivity is a bit high and I end up changing 3 tracks instead of 1.Because of how uncustomizable it is, I feel as though I'll never use even half the buttons on this thing. This product could use some upgrades, or maybe a price drop."
3,You get what you paid for...,"When I bought this I had very high expectations for this but when I received it and started using it I was disappointed. The software to configure it could be better and more friendly to the user. I bought this specifically to use it with nVidia's nStant Media, so I researched it first in the web page to see if they supported it and they said they do. But when I tried to use it, was no good, I couldn't even make the play button to work. There are some functions in Media center that don't work either. I am using the remote control only with Windows Media Player for watching DVD's, and iTunes for music. I guess next time I will spend a little more money so I can use what I bought with what I want."
3,"Works Great, When it works at all","Unfortunately the search for a good PC remote doesn't end here. Setup and software installation is easy and straight forward with this device - plug it in, put the disk in and that's just about all there is to it.It has all necessary functions and promised to be perfect. The problem is it frequently just stops working until the computer is rebooted. The newest driver available for windows on the company's website is over 2 years old. There was a promise of a vista driver in june but still no sign of it and their ""knowledge base"" has been offline for at least a month. The FAQ available only covers the simplest of problems, so again, no help there.You might still want to buy this remote, the price isn't awful - just be aware it isn't going to work as well as claimed."
4,Great Product for the Money,"I love this little gadget. I listen to a lot of internet radio streams and got tired of hearing the same commercials over and over, so now I just mute it. If I want to change streams-zap. I gave it 4 Stars because the software can't keep up with all the player updates. So I don't update as often. It will still work with the newer versions in my experience with Winamp, but you might have a few glitches. Write an e-mail to the manufacturer with player version and they will work on it. A great product for the price!"
2,Crashes,"I can use this thing once or twice, maybe three times, and then the program crashes, often bringing the whole computer down. I have uninstalled & reinstalled several times. No luck. Stopped using it."
3,Not as good as hoped for,"Works good, just not as good as I had hoped it would. Not flexible as far as which applications can be controlled. If it isn't on the list you can not add it or control it. Ended up trying out a mini Logitech keyboard, seems to be working out a little better but it also has it's issues."
2,Does not work with 64 bit Vista (or 64 bit anything for that matter).,"This remote had great potential since it had native support for almost all of the media programs, and there were plugins for it from Girder and Event Ghost.Unfortunately, their description of ""Windows Vista (any edition)"" means any 32-bit edition. If you're running 64-bit Vista the drivers will not work. Their web site states that they hope to have 64 bit drivers in the near future, but I'm not holding my breath. This thing's going back. I should have done better research before purchasing this, and it didn't help that Amazon, while usually amazing in the shipping speed department, decided to take 3 weeks to ship this item."
4,Works well for what it is.,"I got the Streamzap to control a PC I'm using as a glorified DVD player. It works as advertised, but has some limitations. The biggest issue is that the directional buttons are only four-way, so moving the cursor on the screen is a pain. Also, when using Windows Media Player to watch DVD's, the directional buttons don't work to navigate the menu, forcing me to switch to mouse mode. I set the programmable buttons to start media player, switch to full screen, and switch to mouse mode - which works well for me."
3,It works; but ...,"It seems to have this problem with the number of steps one can take with it. Let's say that I want to forward through a movie. It will allow me to take several steps forward but then stops working for a while. I have to wait for it to allow me to continue. I wait a while and then it lets me take a few more steps.Other than that, it works as advertised."
1,Failed Device,I purchased it to use as a remote control for playing music with either itunes or Media Monkey and it has totally failed to work.
4,Great for those who don't want to customize!,"We used this remote to program a Sony AV-RM3000 remote, but we need more flexibility for our HTPC. In hindsight, we should have bought a stand-alone IR unit and something like the Girder software. Or, maybe just an IR wireless keyboard.This is not a remote for those seeking flexibility, or those who like to customize their media experience. This is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability, and don't want to bother with customization. It's well-built, and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for.Pros: Comfortable shape, sensible layout, high-quality feel, reasonably compatible with many programsCons: Doesn't do absolutely everything in every compatible application, only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited options"
2,Like an ADD child,"This product sounds great. Control your PC from anywhere in your room!! Cool!! It even installed easily. But that's when the problems started. Programs just don't listen to the remote. I'll be listening to a song on itunes, and want to change it. I take the remote, point it at the reciever, press the button, the little activity light on the reiver lights up and....nothing happens. The song doesnt change, the cursor doesn't move, zippo. So i push the button again, this time it will work. Or maybe it doesn't, so you push it again, then five minutes latter, suddenly, the playlist skips twice.To make a long story short, this product is just plain unreliable. When it works, it is awsome. When it doesn't, there is no explanation. I think it is a great concept, that needs some serious refinement."
2,This is an OUTDATED remote,It worked pretty good when I bought it a couple of years ago. Apparently the manufacturer made there money and quit supporting this remote. It works for a lot of standard and older Windows programs but has no support for any programs made in the last 3 years. It looks like they are still selling this to make easy money but it has no support for newer programs. Good programs like J. River Media Center just give you a message that it is not supported. If you go to their web site you will find that no updates have been made to their software in 5 years.
5,Works Great!,I love my PC Remote. It's easy to use and easy to set up. I use it for one at the office and one at home every day to run presentations and my pc jukebox at home. I just bought four more for my friends and family. I read another review about someone having problems. I have not had one. It just works!
2,Disappointing,"I installed on a clean XP/SP3 installation, updated to the latest drivers. It crashed three times within 2 hours of use. Certain warnings come up occassionally that actually render the unit useless until you go to the PC keyboard to cancel out of them. Not what I was hoping for."
3,it crashes,"I use it rarely but it still crashes. Very annoyingOther than that is really good, I tried four or five receivers and this is the best"
2,Won't stay programmed for desktop pc,"It's easy to program, just won't stay and every time you have to clean out the computer cache or reboot the computer you have to re-program the remote control again. Just a waste of $30, may as well keep your money and continue doing as you've done before in the past before having another remote control to throw in the pile with the others."
4,Great remote,"Really like this remote. It is the first PC remote I have owned and have few things to complain about. It was difficult to install the drivers. Once installed, though, it worked really well."
2,PC remote,The remote worked as advertised. I can not use it because there is a lag when using with Zoomplayer. The result is when a video is playing it is impossible to use fast forward or fast rewind. Also there is no way to use time seek or time jump due to there is no wheel or track ball on the remote.
2,"Frequent Software Crashes, Poor Support","I purchased this remote for my SageTV computer. When the software worked it worked quite well. The 4 color buttons can be assigned to do anything including batch files. However, multiple times per day the StreamZap software would crash and stop working making me get up and use the attached mouse to acknowledge the error and restart the software. It appears that the software is not well supported by looking at their web site. I contacted the tech support email and did receive a response but no resolution (or even an attempt at a resolution) to my problem. I would not recommend this product."
4,Works ok if you have correct installation instructions,"IMPORTANT! If you're using a 64-bit operating system, you must get special installation instructions from the manufacturer! I spent way too much time trying to get this device to work before I learned that. (My initial review was VERY negative as I didn't think the product worked.) This is a good product that works as advertised. Just make sure you have the correct installation instructions."
2,Basic remote with few features and a 50% chance of working,"Still no 64 bit drivers. Unacceptable. Close to 50% of Windows computers today have 64 bit operating systems so you have basically a 50/50 chance of this even working on your system. Beyond that, it has very few customization options and it frequently can't find your media application and just stops responding altogether. This should be your absolute last choice."
4,Good Value,"Works decently enough, is buggy in linux. Don't disconnect the receiver while the computer is running, or risk kernel panic."
2,Outdated dog of a remote with no 64-bit support,"I first purchased this remote for my MythTV box. It worked okay, but I had to keep the receiver hidden from direct room lighting because it was overly-sensitive to florescents, which it interpreted as a constant IR signal. Recently I switched it to a 64-bit box running Vista Ultimate, and would you believe 64-bit drivers do not exist for the Stramzap?The following quote was posted on the Streamzap website on July 9, 2007. Two years ago today...""Please note that we currently support only 32-bit Windows operating systems. We hope to provide support for 64-bit operating systems in the future.""The company's website was last updated sometime in 2008. It does not appear Streamzap still has an interest in supporting their product. As much as it pains me to say this -- Streamzap being a local-ish company -- anybody considering the purchase of this remote and receiver would be best served looking elsewhere."
4,Sprituality that makes sense for a change!,"As a disenfranchised Catholic, I found Rich Rahn's down-to-Earth and real take on spirituality refreshing and absolutely applicable to my daily life. Something my religious upbringing had failed me. So, if you're like me, you'll find this little book that's full of big ideas a welcome read. I really liked it. And so will all my friends who are getting it for Christmas!"
4,"Interesting, fascinating. Makes you really think.",I was really surprised by this little book. So packed full of super interesting things. Ways to look at life and the world. Get it. Opens your mind! Improves your life!
5,Excellent reference,This book is a great overview of a complex city from it's beginnings. Nicely illustrated. Wonderful and not overdone timeline of events and architecture.
3,More Like Morning Sickness!,"I can see why he is just ""kind of"" a big deal. There was no development of the charactors and it seems like he spent little to no time editing. Did he perhaps write this over a long weekend? The beginning was powerful, but it was downhill from there. Ernest Hemingway? I think not. But keep up the good work there is most certainly potential...and if not in writing novellas then perhaps as a comedian! I know I laughed!"
4,kids like it,"Loved the price, this item is hard to find in IL. I like to thank the sender for sending it to me in a timly fashion."
1,Unutterable terror.,"Please don't show this to children, it terrified me beyond words.I'm sure some children think this is the best thing ever, but I can't even think about it 20 years later without getting shivers."
1,"If this is ""Informal"", I'd hate to see what ""Formal"" is.","Instead of actually showing any handy numerical processes used to figure out problems, this book tries to tell you via overly-wordy and remarkably garbled explanations in the middle of ""real world"" situations gathered from statistics. The authors' idea of ""Informal"" apparently means burying explanations under useless jargon. If you want to pass a Calculus class and don't already have a talent for mathematics, this is not the book to use. Use something that's straight to the point and ditch the ""Informal Approach""."
2,"""FOB"" deals with the stereotypes and fears of immigrants","This book contains many plays written by Mr. Hwang but the one play that I will review will be ""FOB."" The play ""FOB"" focuses on the power struggle between the 2 sexes and the battle between Mainland Chinese immigrants and Americanized Chinese. One aspect of the dislike that I had with the book was the inconsistant behaviors of the characters. But one thing I liked is the about this play is that it can be very interpertive and that the story is not very straight forward"
5,Best book I have ever read,"The book Private Parts was the first time I picked up a book without putting it down. Why can't some of the other celebrities tell the truth. Why are they so afraid? Why isn't Howard afraid to tell it all, the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth....."
4,A hysterical look into one man's life and ideas,"I not a big Stern fan, but when I picked this up for reading on an international flight, I was surprised on how much fun this book is. Howard interjects bits of his philosophy into part of his life, which makes it an entertaining book to read. Even if a chapter is dedicated to Butt Bongos or Homosexuals, they are funny and interesting. Hey, even my mother liked this book."
5,Stern Rules,"Lesbians, pot, Fred, and Ben Stern, what more does one need? In a society that refuses to face controversy, Stern's frankness on taboo issues is refreshing and hilarious."
3,okay,"This reads like a high school sophomore's diary he wrote knowing his friends would read it. It's kind of dumb, but entertaining. If Howard hadn't hawked this thing hour after hour on his radio show, it would hardly have been a best-seller. People (including me) were buying the sizzle, and not the steak. One thing about Howard that comes across in this book is that he is a hypocrite. He thinks because he puts himself down, it's okay for him to put down others. But if someone ELSE puts him down...he gets upset. He dishes it out, but can't take it...."
1,Worse book I've ever read,"This is the worse book on the market, I bought it, and I'm sorry I just did't read it at bn instead. It is a dirty, dirty book, with pictures the same. It goes no place, run on sentences; fragmented senences. Talked about his fight with the FCC and people who don't like his dirty talk. He glorifies his time spent on destroying his previous employers Radio Station out of revenge. What a sick mind and book."
4,"Good, for what it is","You know, I've been a fan since the summer between 6th and 7th grade, right before Stern left 66 WnnnnnnnnnnnnBC and went on to K-Rock. I consider him and the crew, ""friends,"" and my 4 yrs at UCONN were great except the huge void in my morning radio habits. anyway, it sometimes makes me cringe to read fellow listeners' comments. Most give all-too-easy ammunition for Stern detractors to point out how stupid his loyal listeners are. Stern is brilliant at what he does on the radio, and those of us who have been listening learned nothing new in the book. but, it didnt matter at all. Good Entertainment is entertaining no matter how you slice it. F Jackie and the Horse Tooth Jackass."
5,A race to put Howard Stern Down!!,"Coming from Australia, we don't get to hear much of Howard Stern, And aren't WE missing out!!! My wife and I had a race to finish this book, the only trouble was it was never put down. Howard can make ya laugh and make ya wince in disgust, but you can never leave the book alone. One of the best books we have both read together! And now on to another book from Amazon.com Miss America."
4,Good book,"I watch and listen to Howard Stern. I can not say that I like, agree with or condone any of his actions or beliefs..but I like to watch him. I think that is the reason why, Howard Stern is totally different than I am, and I loved to get riled up and then laugh at some of his antics on the televison and radio. I bought the book thinking it would be something I couldnt finish, but I did enjoy it. It was pretty well written."
5,This Howard Stern is Dead,The book now belongs in the fiction department because Howard Stern 2010 is now a liberal Hamptons Rosie O'Donnell-Chevy Chase loving phony.
