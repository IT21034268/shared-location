2,Without Remorse,I became very bored with this book almost from the time I started reading it. It is the first Tom Clancy book that effected me this way. I'm still a fan of Clancy but I will choose the next book with more caution.
5,An Excellent Entry by Tom Clancy,"Without Remorse is the kind of book that Clancy Fans have wanted since The Hunt for Red October, and especially Patriot Games debuted. John Kelly/Clark raises many questions about ourselves. How far would you go to avenge those that you love, and where does justice begin?I highly recommend this book for its realistic portrayal of events that undoubtedly have a basis in someone's life storyLarry S. Buchanan Jr."
4,Drug- pushers are for shooting,"Tough combat vetran kills drug-pushers left and right, because they killed his girl friend. In between killing gangsters at home he slips (actually swims) into North Vietnam to help save the lives of American POWs.I had to read this big book to the end to find in what creative way he kills off all the pushers, but I could only do it by skiping and skiming over and through detailed build-up that was just too long and slow for me.I prefer, for example, Dan Brown's more concise method of crafting thillers -- due to this prefrence of mine -- I take one star away from Mr. Clancy."
5,Violence manifested in a standalone novel,"Although the Jack Ryan fans are used to the books building on one another, this one features a side character. This book can be read by anyone who feels that books just can't do it for them. I have lent this book to three or four others, and the ones who actually read it loved it! It's a great book!You do not have to know about Clancy's previous books to enjoy this one; that alone makes it a good selection in some cases. I would think that this book would be enjoyed by anyone who likes action movies."
2,Penguin has failed again!,"I'm not sure why each book converted to a Kindle version done by Penguin Publishing is so poorly edited. Whether it is placing semicolons where there should be letters, or not putting a break between obvious perspective changes causing the reader to wonder if they missed and entire page or paragraph. To say their work is amateurish, is to insult amateurs. If the publisher is going to charge this much for their books, they should at least have someone who passed high school English be doing the job."
3,Without Remorse/Tom Clancy,He does a good job of making it realistic but falls far short on moral content. This is just soft porn. His knowledge of the internal information from mostly secret information is unreal.
4,The 3 lives of John Clark,Riviting action with deep concern for the main characters makes it difficult to put down.
3,Stripless Cartoon,"Reading a book by Clancy is like reading a cartoon without drawings. Indeed, books by Clancy are written cartoons. The good guys are honest, decent, virtuous, respectable, straight, and rightful; the bad guys are vicious, evil, wicked, wretched, despicable, perverted, and wrongful. Good guys marry doctors (Ryan and Rosen, first-class characters) or nurses (Clark and Chavez, second-class characters). Bad guys take lives while doctors and nurses save and give lives. Good guys kill bad guys to stop their taking innocent lives. A few lucky bad guys get just wounded and heal in good guys' wives' colleagues hands. Good guys are so good they never envy one another and bad guys are so bad they keep coveting another's good. Yet, in spite of all that nonsense and even though it has nothing to do with actual life, reading Clancy is always fun. Of course, this is not Literature. But, never mind, Tom, keep on writing stories... I must confess I love them."
4,Pedro's Review,Without Remorse gave the backstory on one of the most secretive and coolest character in the Clancy series. Although this installment in the series started off kind off slow it soon became action packed and I think it contained some of the coolest fight scenes in the entire series. Learning about John Clark's past also made him a much deeper character andn explained much of the mystery in the earlier books
1,Without excuse,"An exciting story of a serial killer vigilante as American super hero in a black and white world of myopic tunnel vision. If you don't mind troglydyte heroes who are predominantly white, and unidimensional villains who are predominantly ethnic or racial minorities than this book is for you."
2,Scary- but for the wrong reason,"Has anyone ever noticed that Tom Clancy's characters often have a near psychotic revenge thing going on? It makes me wonder if Clancy writes these books as some kind of subconscious therapy rather than entertainment for us. What happend to Mr Clancy early in life for him to have this need for violent revenge ending in death? This whole book is basically just one big revenge story; character falls in love with druggie girl, girl is murdered, character extracts revenge by torturing and murdering those responsible. Why would anyone want a 700+ page novel about that kind of thing? I'll discreetly book a psychiatry appointment for Mr Clancy and hopefully when he's better he won't inflict such travesty's on the reading public. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because he had the sense not to turn it into a 1000+ behemoth like he often does. Or maybe he just ran out of ideas. Anyway, I'm grateful!"
4,Less technical less predictable.,I needed to see Clancey take a different spin. This was less technical. Tom C. was becoming predicitable in his style. This revenge approach created an excitement to see what Tom might come up with next.
5,"first clancy book for me, and definatly not my last!","i just read the last page about 10 min. ago, and belive me, after 2 months of reading this 750 page paperback (2x bigger than any book i have ever read in the past) i am now sold that clancy is one of the best authors of our time. this was the second book i have read in about 4 years, and now i will ddefinatly never go that long again. no remorse reminded me how much fun it is to read!"
4,Clancy's best written character.,"A few years ago I got into a kick where I read all of the Clancy books. I soon discoverd that Clancy does not write literary masterpeices. He writes enthralling fiction. While this book is not as good as Red Storm Rising, this book, while extremely entertaining, excells because the Clark character seems alive and real. His depth is unmatched, I think, by any other character in Clancys' books. This is a character I want to meet.As to the gentleman from Liverpool, I understand your concern for the depiction of the left wing during the Vietnam War era. However, I must remind you that Clancy makes it perfectly clear that he stands to the right. While I hardly agree with all that entails, I keep that in mind when reading his books. Do not let that deter you from a good book."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CLANCY BOOK OUT THERE!,"Clancy shows a much more human side to his characters in this story. The people are no longer simply soldiers, but now they are people with real feelings and values. There is minimal ""military action"" in comparison to many earlier Clancy novels, however, this is actually good. As I read Without Remorse, I could almost feel the hurt, anguish, and (later) satisfaction of retribution. This book takes you on a real emotional roller-coaster."
4,"One of his best, but too heroic","Without remorse is Clancy's return to a good novel. Not too much technology involved. This book is perfect, but sometimes John Kelly acts like the Terminator, or Chuck Norris.(no one can hurt you). Except for the time in the car, he never had to experience any physical pain."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"My father gave me the hardcopy right after it came out, as he knew of my addiction (shared by him) for Tom Clancy works. It was my first introduction to Mr. Clark. I started out, like most, with Hunt For Red October, and until this book, it (Red October) was my ""most appreciated"". This book is awesome, a page-turner extraordinaire, with a plot that grabs you right away. The writing style is pure Clancy, inducing lots of visual images for the reader. One of his best works, in my opinion."
4,"Great book, poor delivery","There are so many spelling errors, missplaced punctuation, and random numbers in this electronic edition that it almost detracts from the experience. Great book otherwise"
4,The History of John Kelly aka John Clark,"This was a great book. Very different from the other Clancy books that I have read, but very good none the less. While Clancy's books deal with espionage, and war, this book takes those aspects and put them in the background. Shoved to the foreground is a revenge story. This is a great book with characters that you care about, and some very exciting action sequences. This book is highly recommended."
3,Sounds hollow,Sorry not to be much enthousiastic. The book is nevertheless a fair read although having a classic plot without surprises and being binary.
2,A meandering plot,"This novel really did not hold my interest. It starts out with a number of seemingly unrelated incidents. The author apparently knows where he is and when he is, but it would be nice if he would share that with his readers. The novel then proceeds with a bunch of parallel plots, jumping continually from one to another. That is compounded by the author occasionally telling you how to build a watch when you just wanted to know the time. Do we really need a manual on building sound suppressors for handguns?The various plots eventually start to come together but, by that time, I was losing interest and skimming over substantial amounts of material trying to get on with the story. I regret that I followed the advise of the majority of reviewers, who rated it with four and five stars, and purchased the novel. It is a skimmer rather than a page-turner, and it is not on my listing of recommended novels for other readers."
5,Clancy's best book...,"If you haven't reas WITHOUT REMORSE yet, then you don't really understand how good of a writer Clancy is.Set during the early '70s, this novel is the backsttory for John Kelly AKA Clark, the CIA operative who figures extensively throughout Clancy's Jack Ryan series. As much a morality play as adventure, this book explores Clark's life from happily-married Navy veteran to CIA operative. Clark battles his demons, both real and imaginary until he is forced by circumstance to risk it all.The book is technically accurate, and excellent in both character and plot development. It's a page turner and never predictable. I've reread it several times and continue to enjoy the nunaces that escape one on a first read. It would be a great movie if Hollywood wouldn't butcher it like, say, SUM OF ALL FEARS.You won't regret buying it."
2,rambo,"There must be many Charles Bronson fans here. In Clancy's world, Clark would be (and probably will be) an ideal president who would brutally execute all undesirables. I'd sooner vote for Hollywood Hulk Hogan."
2,"Same formula, same result","This book does not deviate from the formula that has made Clancy a successful writer. There are actually two or three plot lines going on at once, that all tie together in the end. The downside of this method is the same in this book as it is in his others as well. Interesting beginning, followed by several hundred pages of less than interesting material, followed by an exciting finish. It works well in some cases, however this book seemed to lack the suspense that his other novels have. There were a few twists and turns at the end, but nothing too surprising.My other criticism of Clancy's book is the same as my other reviews. Too much profanity and the repeated use of violent rape scenes to move the plot along. That's not entertaining to me. If it wasn't for the fact that I already have his books sitting on my bookshelf, I wouldn't be reading any more Tom Clancy."
2,Heavy-handed justice,"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's thrillers. Unfortunately, most of what makes them enjoyable to me is sadly lacking in this novel - the intricate global conflicts between various countries and political groups, the gobs of military technology, the inner workings and interactions of various government agencies.What we are given here instead is a tale of one man fighting his own private war on drugs. An interesting idea, but unlike Mr. Clancy's usual subject matter he demonstrates little knowledge of the domestic U.S. drug trade. The Drugs Are Bad message is hammered home in an unnecessarily preachy manner, and I found myself wishing that Clancy had been more succinct. Nancy Reagan managed to sum up the point of this novel in three words, and I'll echo them as my advice to potential readers: Just Say No."
2,The Audio Version Was Not Without Disappointment,"This review refers to the abridged audio book, read by David Dukes.The story was entertaining enough, but Mr. Dukes' reading was quite disappointing. He seemed to squeeze all of Mr. Clancy's many characters into one of a few vocal catagories: noble, pinched, gruff, and female. (The ""female"" voice, a too-soft falsetto southern belle, was particularly painful.) Many passages began with Mr. Dukes reading spoken dialogue which I mistook for a completely unintended character. Also, his voice tends to taper off at the ends of his sentances, I suppose for dramatic effect. I often got the impression that Mr. Dukes was thinking, ""Man, I really sound cool reading this really cool book...""FYI - On a side note, I'm not a fan of written or verbal profanity, and this book has more than its fair share."
5,Tom Clancy... There is no substitute.,"This is perhaps the best example of Tom Clancy's incredible character development. The main character, John Kelly, a.k.a. Mr. Clark, leaps off the page larger than life! It is an incredible account of how this fascinating character came to be, and of his unyielding moral code that drives him to do what no one else will, or could. Powerful, intense, emotional are the immediate words that come to mind to describe this dynamic novel. Action packed, and touching, it is truly Tom Clancy at his finest"
4,My favorite Clancy,First introduced to Clancy with The Hunt for Red October (don't know how to underline) I have read nearly all of his books but to be honest Jack Ryan has always dissapointed me. It is ridiculous to use the same character in so many unconnected plots and still hope to mantain realism. Ryan himself seems to have become an even weaker character now than in Clancy's early works as he now seems to be preaching his ethics constantly. I personally feel that Without Remorse is the only story of Clancy's with true character development. I did not give the book five stars as this will be reserved only for my absolute favorite books.
2,"Non-techie, good series background story","I admit I am one of the Clancy techno fans.(Ex-Navy) If you are like me you could skip this one but I also love the references he makes to previous novels and want to be ready for them. This one will give you some insight to comments by Mr. Clark in Clear and Present Danger. Still a good story with some military/cia angles, but not the gripping thrillers of previous Clancy fame."
4,"The plot's good, but spare me the meathead stuff.","I like Tom Clancy overall and I did indeed like this book. It contains the best and the worst elements of his writing. The plot, as always, was intriguing and interesting. I'm usually able to remember the details of Clancy novels years after I've read them, and 'Without Remorse' will be no exception. At the same time though, enough of the conservative ranting and raving! Drugs in the inner city and how they corrupt our innocent youth. A girl victimized into becoming a prostitute, but saved (for a while) by the main character's love. The typical goody-goody theme that people of different backgrounds CAN get along (like Clark and the doctor who runs aground on his island). Maybe it's just me, but I get enough of this 'big-hearted' stuff on TV. So yet again, another good book, but not a great one."
2,Without Remorse,"Umm yea this was my first experience reading tom clancy so I don't have any strong feelings one way or another. So yea it's very obvious that he does do a lot of research before writing so much so that i myself got lost in some of the military jargon and weapons lingo. But it was a compelling plot, straight forward and easy to understand. Sometimes it was a little confusing to keep track of characters especially the navy admirals because they mentioned like 3 different names for each character, first, last, and nickname. Then he wouldn't talk about them again for another chapter or so. So by the time you think you've figured it out you've forgotten the next time the characters come around. The characters themselves were a little two dimensional and the dialog also needed some work I doubt very much that people are straightforward. All and all I give it a 4 out of 10."
3,make love AND war (and get bit by both),"It was hard to bring myself to read another Jack Ryan novel, especially one as thick as book is. It was a daunting and adventurous feeling before I delved into the book.I was honestly expecting much more action in Vietnam. If you have pictures of Huey helicopters on the cover, I'm expecting some good portion of this book to take place in Vietnam. However, most of the book is set in the streets hunting down and killing drug dealers (1 rightousness point!). Unprotected sex with an escaped prostitute (-1 logic point). Training with soldiers in the country (1 cool point). One car chase (-1 cliche point)Considering the length of the book, I expected more. I'd say this is a substandard Clancy book. I want more military and less ""ex-solider"" kind of stuff."
4,Background on John Clark,"Another side-show attraction to the Ryan series which tells the background of John Clark and how he came to be the most trusted field operative in the Ryan series. Excellent concept to provide answers to one of the most mysterious characters in contemporary spy novels. Book can be some-what over the top graphically, but serves a purpose in the story. Must read for any John Clark fan."
3,"Great book, bad Kindle conversion","This is by far my favorite Clancy book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Jack Ryan series, or anyone with an interest in military fiction. It is definitely a 4-5 star book.The reason that I give it 3 stars is the Kindle conversion. The formatting is just not professional enough for a Kindle book priced at $6-$7. There are a LOT of misspelled words, and many of them aren't even properly-spelled but wrong words -- they are just gibberish. Also, Clancy makes heavy use of italicized text, which the Kindle version tends to munge up. If it was one or two, I could live with it, but it's at least one every few pages, and some have so many that it distracts from the story.Summary: great story, fantastic writing, just a horrible editing job in the Kindle version."
2,without remorse,I did not enjoy this book at all. would not reccomend it. This certainly was not one of his better books.
4,A fine Conclusion,"I had no idea this book was coming out, I was just browesing the Young Adult section at my local Barnes and Nobel when I stumbled across the book, and I bought it, despite knowing I could get it alot cheaper at amazon.com.The novel is different from the other two for one main reason - there is no more ""getting to know the characters"" at this point they are all established people with established traits. In the book they take a trip across country which tests there relationships, but it also brings a realistic twist to thses novels... something that was sorta missing in the last two.I loved the fact this book was set on teh road as it allowed for some really interesting subplots, and while the ending seems rushed, the place the author leaves teh characters in is a perfect way to end the series."
5,Best Book Ever,I am very delighted with the book Rainbow Road by Alex Sanchez. This book is a great book for those who are going through homosexual problems. Like not knowing how to come out to your family and friends. But that was mainly covered in Rainbow High. I personally love this book. It helped me understand how life is for the people who are gay. It also taught me that homosexuals are humans with feelings and go through everything we go through and more.This book also helped me with how to approach a homosexual or how to respond to them too. In this book the three friend encounter a lot of difficult problems. They meet a whole lot of different people. They go through many hardships and other things humans go through. At the end all ends well when the trio still end up friends even though Nelson stayed in L.A. to make a new life with his new lover Manny while Kyle and Jason closer than ever make it back to D.C. Rainbow Road is a great book with a perfect ending and I loved it.
5,Getting Oriented by Paul Laughlin,"This book is a must for forward thinking Christians and for those who have become disillusioned with the faith and are willing to take a different view. I think the book demonstrates that there is an alternate to abandoning your faith by showing how it can be reinterpreted. A rare book to be written by a minister but written by one who is well qualified to do so. Equally as good as his first book ""Remedial Christianity"""
2,Bad Sizing,"The product listing for size claims a waist of 32"" should order a Medium, which I did only to receive a belt that had a total length of only 33"". My old belt (different brand) was also a size M and had an overlap of at least 6 inches. The Jasper had an overlap of 1/2"" - hardly adequate. When I complained, they admitted that their product does run small. Quite the understatement! I had to return the belt at my own expense and they replaced it with the next size. My advice to anyone ordering this product is to ignore their size specifications and order one or two sizes larger."
3,A quick take on 'Escort',"This is a nice book but I am not able to give it a blistering endorsement. For me, it was too shy on day-to-day descriptions of the work of an escort ship. I was hoping to better understand how they operated. Like many British veterans of WWII, Rayner is too close with the truly juicy bits. On the other hand, his is an interesting story, full of fun pieces of sea lore and wartime history. But the British standoffishness keeps the reader at bay a bit too much."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,I ordered a watch from this company. It would not run and I returned it. That was 3 months ago and I still have not been able to get a refund!
4,"A heart-warming, realistic story","As an education professional involved with young people I read these books a lot. I was moved by this tale and found it paralleled the lives of some young people I know. I could hardly wait to read the sequel. Ms Voight has also branched out in her later works, even into historical novels. She is a writer to be reckoned with."
3,Suffers the North American airplay syndrome,"This was a first North American release in a long time.It suffers like Innocence is No Excuse and Rock the Nations in wimping out in a number of songs in order to get North American airplay, or increased sales.Not as good as previous recordings like Dogs of War, Solid Ball of Rock, where there was no such pressure.I bet you, the cuts that did not make the recording, would have if not for this North American airplay syndrome, and made it comparable to such non-North American recordings"
2,Just usual stuff,"All songs sounds like the same (there is only one slowly song on it), like just good stuff of the 80`s, with no new elements (I already heard that style hundred times). The sound is great, but that is all"
3,Notable but a bit of an overstretch...,"Far from being a return to the impressive and utterly convincing'Power&the Glory'era,this album rocks nevertheless.But the vocal performance is very weak and the lyrics are tired and cliche,reducing the impact of this 1997 Saxon record."
5,One damn good song after another,"Put in on, turn it up, crank it loud, if you remember the NWOBH then why have you forgotten about SAXON, the most underated haevy metal band in the world. This cd is pure unadulterated heavy metal at its finest. Right from gothic dreams at the start through to the tear jerking absent friends near the end."
5,Looking at dinosaurs from the human angle,"Recently, I became interested in dinosaur programs. Only thing: dinosaur programs, at least most of the ones I've seen, tend to take the side of the dinosaurs! Not this program. This program involves you in the lives of different people from that time. It was entertaining and original. I also enjoyed the graphics. If you are interested in this time period, I would reccommend this dvd. Then come back & tell everyone what you think!"
4,Good Hammer Mystery,"While not equal with ""I, the Jury"" or ""My Gun is Quick"", this book is a step up from ""The Girl Hunters"", the previous one in the series. Hammer is at his normal tricks, shooting thugs and slugging it out with crooks, trying to protect a young girl from hitmen. This book is Spillane at the top of his game, with or without the unbelievable ending."
5,Harmonics,"I loved this CD from start to finish. My fingers never even itched to hit the forward button, not for a second. I love the harmonics they employ, weaving in and out of each other beautifully.'The Space Song' was my instant favorite. I had heard 'Save Me' before, though not the version on this CD. That's not a complaint exactly. While not the same song I had heard on ""Roswell,"" it does have its own beauty in the bridge that I can't get out of my head.'Patience' is a song I find myself humming when I haven't listened to the CD in days.Catchy is not the word I'd use for this group and that's what sets them apart from song continously played on the radio, where the songs get stuck in your head in the most annoying ways. Haunting is better. A song comes to mind and you smile. It's a shame more people have not heard of The Pierces. I like having this little secret but I'd rather have them be a part of common consciousness.Absolutely perfect for any mood."
2,Bland and Boring Too,"Could this possibly be the same group who created the absolutely brilliant ""Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge""? The Pierces' ""Light of the Moon"" is bland and boring, the tunes redundant and indistinguishable from their equally as boring and uninspired ""The Pierces."" I bought ""Thirteen..."" first and loved it so much I went searching for their other albums. Unfortunately, their other albums have turned out to be a bitter disappointment. If you like witty, snarky, snappy beats, stick with ""Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge"" and forget the rest."
5,Perfect condition A++ Seller,The Cd just came in perfect condition not a scratch the songs are amazing i had listened to them before hand but i coudln't find the cd anywhere at a good price and i finally found it and i jumped to the chance and it's amazing i love the pierces the have writen some really good songs from the start of their career this is their 2nd album and it's great nothing else to say
3,OK Read,"It's an OK read to pass the time while waiting for the next release by your favorite author (which in my case is Lynne Graham). There are some hot sex scenes but other than that not much to recommend this book. There is no emotional intensity, no emotional connection. The overwhelming feeling that I get in reading this book was that the characters were in LUST with each other, not in love. I did not get the sense that the hero was falling deeply in love with the heroine, until he tells her at the end."
2,It's ok,This was an ok book. I don't have to much to say about it. It is defentily set up in Australia.
3,very quite but not enough air flow,"I bought 3 of them when it was onsale, due to its all 5-star reviews, paid about $27.59 including shipping. Oh man, now I am regret at my decision. The big problem is that air flow of these fans too little, it's almost useless or it does not blow air flow as a normal 120mm fan should do. Does it blow out 44CFM air? I don't think so. It simply does not do the work.The only pro is: it is indeed very quite, if you have a low end PC, doesn't require even medium air flow, this is a good choice. otherwise, go buy other good 120mm fans on the market."
4,good product,"it works, its quiet enough, but i feel like it should push more air.... but then that would get rid of the quiet part so it works for what id does, and after about 2 months it still works fine. nuthin bad yet"
5,The childern saved the day,"I liked the story because,have a Norwegian back ground. My father is from Norway. He told me this story when I was a small boy. I think the just of the story is true. The children did move the gold and save the wealth of the country. They did put one over on the Germans. This is good for history and what children can contribuite. Thanks for letting me express my thoughts."
4,Snow Treasure Is Funny!,"I am a 12-year-old boy, and I thought Snow Treasure was amazing and funny. It had lots of facts and tidbits weaved throughout the story about how the Nazis invaded Norway. The Norwegians had $9,000,000 worth of gold, and they didn't want the Nazis to get it. The gold was sledded 35 miles every day to get to the pick-up spot. Every day kids would take down four bars of gold each and bury the bars of gold and build a snowman over them so a freighter could pick them up and take them to America. They had several close calls where they almost either ran into Nazis or had the Nazis suspect something and try to take their gold away. In this book, the children are listed as heroes for saving all the gold bullion. This book was originally published in New York in February, 1942."
4,Children make heroic patriots,"In 1940 the Nazis came to Norway. The patriots of the country did not want their country's gold to fall into Nazi hands and support the war from the wrong side, but knew of no way to get it to safety. This is the story of the brave children who appeared to constantly be playing in the snow, but were transporting the gold on their sleds past the Nazis. At night men would locate the gold where the children had hidden it, and remove it to a ship. It was taken safely away to America beyond the Nazis' reach.This story would be ideal for a family read aloud book."
1,recent book order,"To say I am disappointed with my recent twelve book order for my grandchildren would be an understatement. First I recently learned I was on ""one Click"" not that I ever asked to be, so my order came to my home rather than to my grandchildren's . The order came in 5 batches. One never arrived. One was a used duplicate of another book I ordered. One shipment was left on my doorstep during a rainstorm so the package and the contents were ruined. Now I have to package what there is left of the order and ship it to my grandchildren hoping it might get there by Christmas. What a mistake; one that I won't repeat."
4,It was really good but at one time I got bored.,"It was very good but it had to much detail. I got bored at one time. But other than that, it was excellent."
2,Don't open it,"Peter and his friends lived pacefully in Norway, until the Germans invaded his tiny village. So the people of the village have to find a way to save thier gold, that is worth $9,000,000. I though this book was not very interesting , because it was not very exiting."
2,Winter Wallop,"For ages 7 to 9Have you ever sneaked candy at night? Have you ever stolen cookies? Some have, but have you accomplished this? Sneaking 75 pounds of gold on your sled in attempt to save your nation from an undesirable Nazi invasion? I think not. These courageous children did precisely that.In Riswik, Finland the Nazi invasion is reeking panic all over the country and how will they save more than 13 tons of gold from the enemy? The answer is right under their noses... The kids, of course. But will they get massacred? Will they get caught, trapped, cornered or tortured? Read the book to find out more about the kids and their dangerous and perilous adventures.I don't recommend this book because it is not written well. It has a good story but it isn't described well. Only read this book if you love true stories. Otherwise don't bother. I'd try another book. In conclusion, this is not an excellent book."
5,It's still in print!,"I read this book as a child over and over again in the 1960's. I read it so often, the spine fell apart and I lost the first 20 pages. I didn't think this small book would still be in print--but it is! My grandparents were from Norway, I have visited there several times and recall conversations with relatives about hardships during the Nazi occupation. The book reflects the national pride the Norwegians feel for their country and the risks they were willing to take to do what was right - not easy, but right. I still have the book--now I can read the first 20 pages! This book is one of the most memorable books I read as a child--and I read alot!! The story has stayed with me."
5,One of the MOST EXCITING books I read as a child,"This book was such a favorite of mine as a child that I just recently bought a copy for my daughter.It is a story that manages to create a suspenseful adventure from what were terribly risky but courageous acts of resistance on the part of Norwegian children during WWII.The moment I saw the name and author of the book, memories of the pleasure I had reading this story flooded my consciousness. I must have read this book 40 years ago, but it was so exciting and moving that I remember it as if it were yesterday.A wonderful choice particularly for a middle school child, especially one who is not usually a reader--even a child who is reluctant to read will be on the edge of his seat for this story."
2,Review by 5th grade Students,"Snow Treasure is a slightly boring story about Norwegian children helping their country by hiding their gold. We are 5th grade advanced readers. We have to say this story was a little bit repetitive and predictable. There really was no twist or surprises. The characters were not very unique. They didn't have much of a personality. The story line never got going. We would give this book 2 stars out of 5, and that's generous. We would definitely not recommend it, but if you like this genre, you may enjoy reading Number The Stars. Many of our friends read it and enjoyed it."
3,A good book.,I think that Snow Treasure is an incredible story because Peter Lundstrom and his friend Michael Berg have to slip past Nazi Guards with nine million dollars in gold hidden on their sleds (with them on top of the gold). The Nazi troops parachuted to Peter's mini-village and kept the village captive. Nobody thought that the boys could beat the Nazi's until Peter's Uncle Victor came up with a plan on how to fool the enemy. I think that was a dangerous plan. I didn't think that I would ever do what they did! That's incredible!Wendi3rd GraderMichigan
1,Get 'Em while they're young.,"Like just about every other kid in America,I was forced to read this book in school.Anti-German hate propaganda for little kids,isn't that just beautiful!WWII has been over for sixty years,isn't about time we called off the hate campaign?What is the point in keeping the hate going for another generation?"
4,Snow Treasure,"I liked this book because it had a lot of action and kept me turning the pages to read on.Its about a Norwegian town called Riswyk. When German troops invade their country so Peter Lundstrom and the other children of Riswyk have to save their towns gold so they thake it to the ""Snake"" where Peter's uncle Victor is keeping his boat and at night he takes the gold the children hid under snowmen and puts it in his boat and when he gets all the gold he will take it to America without the Germans Knowing."
5,Better than ever!,"This album slaps you right in the face and does not say sorry! Overkill has adapted to the times with out being like Met*****a. All I have to say is WOW. I have been listning to Overkill since 1989, and they blow me away. Overkill just keeps on putting out quality metal music. This one is a keeper, so buy it! Thank You Overkill for a decade of butt kicking music"
4,A 1 ton anvil of real heavy metal,"Overkill is what I remember heavy metal used to be. Loud, loud, edgy guitars, booming drums and screaming but understandable vocals. The guitar work on this CD is excellent and the riffs are some of the best Overkill has done over the years. Easy to slide right into and start head-banging. The singer's voice has lost a little power but still does the job. The only misstep to me is the attempted power balled ""Promises"" The song isn't necessarily bad, but the singer doesn't have the voice to pull it off."
3,Mediocre,"I would rather give this album 3.5 stars, but I couldn't. Anyway, after I read rave review after rave review, I decided to buy 'From the Underground and Below.' This is a good album, just not what I expected. The music is hardcore-tinged, and in some places, it even sounds a little industrial. One thing this album is, though- HEAVY. Yes indeed, this album is very heavy. My favorite song is ""The Rip n' Tear"", but I also like ""It Lives"", ""Long Time Dyin'"", ""F.U.C.T."", and ""I'm Alright."" Overall, the only standout track for me is ""The Rip n' Tear."" Other than that, the songs are just average. I don't know, maybe it's Joe and Sebasian's influence. Now that they are both gone, maybe we can get back to the classic Overkill. Buy at your own risk."
5,This is what heavy metal is supposed to be!!,"This is what metal is supposed to be. One of the best metal albums released in the last 10 years and I'm certain that this album was over-loked, under-rated and under-appreciated. It is catchy, blistering fast and represents the best speed metal/thrash metal in years. Overkill has created a masterpiece and it is one of the best albums and probably ranks up there with Metallica's the Black Album. I know one thing- TOP 40 radio won't touch Overkill and that there isn't a place for them in the mainstream. Overkill's album deserves 5 stars and is one of the heaviest albums in years and they were influenced by Black Sabbath and Metallica."
4,solid cd but a bit of a departure from the classic overkill mold,"hear we go another downword spiral.this cd has some great song but the seam to want to experiment alot with styles.more grooves and melodies donsen't make better thrash.I know these years were devote of much thrash inspiartion but these guys helped create thrash metal,play somemore thrash!"
3,Great If You're A Fan,"The book is a wonderful example of Goethe's writting and gives one an insight to his mind. However, it isn't like Faust and is easily set aside. I't good, but don't read it if your not a Romantic, a Germanspeaker, a Goethe Fan, or all three. Try Volume I of this collection, Selected Poems, if your not (You'll wish you were)."
5,Si cierras los ojos mientras comes alguno de estos,"platillos, puedes oler el aire perfumado de Mèxico... Y paladear su sabor autèntico"
1,"""the bigger they are, the harder...""","Eric Clapton was my undisputed hero during the seventies, even with schlock like ""Lay Down Sally,"" or ""Wonderful Tonight."" But here, mid 90's, he drags in Babyface to produce a song for a J Revolta movie. This is rotten. This hurts."
3,Mediocre in both content and structure,"This a practical book highlighting the need to reassess business models. It is one of the most popular books on business models on Amazon but to my surprise I found it mediocre in both content and structure.The book is much too long for the points it delivers and the authors do not dive into the subject of business models more than briefly. It is a basic book on marketing with some ideas and questions relating to One-sided business models. It is filled with obvious statements such as ""Be hard to overtake"" without any discussions about unique assets, capabilities, processes or control mechanisms, and uses headings such as ""Provide sustained benefits for all stakeholders"" but in text only focus on customers. If you plan to operate a lemonade stand this book is perfect for you.//Anders, The Business Model Database"
5,THIS I S A PRACTICAL BOOK,"This is a practical book, but it is not a ""how-to-book"" instead, it deals with the what, when and why; with such tangibles as pricing, cost of doing business and benefits to stakeholders. The authors- Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles researched and found out that unsuccessful companies doggedly apply outdated business models while the successful ones improve their models every 2 to 4 years. The book provides a straightforwad and a systematic method which any company can use to review and improve its business model basing on its key components: pricing, cost of doing business and benefits to its shareholders."
5,Re-Invent Your Business!,This book follows a basic principle of re-invention. Going back and looking to see where you can improve to make your business more profitable. The are several examples of companies who have done just that. Giving you a practical model to succeed. Well worth the price to give your business what it needs to compete in the Global Marketplace.
5,The book your business competitors don't want you to read...,"Mitchell and Coles successfully present the argument for ""why"" to focus on continuous business model innovation and then show you ""where"" and ""how"" to work the model in your own company...But don't think that this book is just another dumbed down, hastily written business book from some wishful management guru. It's not. THE ULTIMATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE is solidly researched and thoughtfully written. It's a serious book for people who are serious about creating a successful business for the long term. The 3rd chapter alone is one of the best examinations of cost-cutting techniques you'll ever find and well worth the price of the book, but happily the entire book is just as useful, applicable, and valuable, which indeed makes it a rarity.Mitchell and Coles have created one of those infrequent stars in the business book constellation that deserve 'must-read' status. And it's definitely a book you'll want to read before your competitors do."
1,Waste of time and money,Don't waste your time and money on this book. It contains a laundry list of what need to do. Nothing inspired. Don't be confused by the high rating. Read a few excerpts you will get my idea.
5,Jam-Packed with Great Information!,"In The Ultimate Competitive Advantage, Don Mitchell and Carol Coles give you a book that is jam-packed with ideas that will help you take your company to the next level and beyond! Their book will teach you to go from good to great - or better yet: from great to greater! Their easy to understand methods of continual innovation and improvement will give you what you need to do it better and more efficiently - and increase the bottom line while you do!"
3,practical guide to innovation,"This is a very practical book designed for business people that systematically goes through what can be done to create a business model that constantly renews itself. It has some good stories that support the flow of ideas, of which there are very many. THe way that it is written makes this a very difficult book to get through if you are looking for a straight read, which I was. I did not enjoy reading it, but will go back to it when the right question arises. Recommened for business people rather than those wanting to understand how businesses are run in a journalistic way."
5,Interesting reading and a reference book of good ideas,"The problem with business books is that the model for success in retail isn't quite the same for service products, or for technology products. So some books are too general for getting good ideas, or they are very specific and then get outdated quickly.""The Ultimate Competitive Advantage"" has a wealth of anecdotes and experience that can be mined for value for your organization. I work in a technology field and I found some of the ideas applicable and quite useful. This is one of those books that you should keep on the shelf and review from time to time. The subject matter is diverse; from successful customer programs to profit-and-loss to diversity.Some of the ideas might become useful as your business direction changes. I think this is a valuable reference and a good book for stimulating ideas of your own."
4,Refreshing Song,"With all the protocol-filled music that is not available, it is refreshing to see someone with more innovative, laidback and unformulaic tunes. Frankie J has a very soulful voice. I was surprised when I first saw him that he could sing like that. The song is great and everything in it works together well. I am definitely looking forward to his debut CD which will be released May 27th. Check them both out!!"
4,darn good,Not a big GALACTICA fan (just never had time to watch it) but this is a good book. The characters are enjoyable and multi-layered. I'll have to check out the other books in this series.
2,IT IS YOUR DESTINY- NOT TO READ THIS BOOK!,"I am a HUGE fan of the first 3 BSG books in this series, especially Armageddon and Warhawk. Those were fun books with tons o' action and hot warrior and cylon action. They were like really good episodes of the second season that never was (BSG 80 doesn't count). But all of the collaborations with Brad Linaweaver are just plain awful. Linaweaver is a simply horrific writer. His sentences and dialogue are completely disjointed, illogical, and nonsensical. The plot and story don't go anywhere. There is a lot about what people are thinking and no one is actually doing anything. Hey Hatch, how about some action and some Cylons!!! How about good story and plot??!! Too much to ask, I guess!! And Starbuck is once again turned into a minor character, whereas Hatch's Apollo is a divine god. Get back with Chris Golden and write some good books again. This Linaweaver is just such a bad, bad, bad writer."
1,It was the worst written book I have read in my whole life.,"As a Backstreet Boys fan, I was disgraced the way that this book interperted their life as super stars. It made them look and sound egotistical and fake. I know by meeting them many times that they are not at all like that.I read a book on the new pop group *NSYNC and was incredibly impressed on how much more talented the band was described as. I wish that in the future the Backstreet Boys could find a better author to write their books."
3,this book,"i liked the book but theres in no pic's in it i have't seen, ecsept the one whit kevin and howie eating, and there is no info i did'n know, besides in the middle of the book comes two pages whit aaron carter, this is a backstreet boys book, but i am a die hard bsb fan so ihave them all,i like to look in it and i have read it a cupple of times i would recomend it if you are a new fan and not like me!"
3,At least it has a story.,"Unlike most horror films today, this film is not ""JUST GORY, NO STORY"" with a trite story line. Lionsgate and Clive Barker are bad about ""JUST GORY, NO STORY"". When I see these names I usually pass on the movie even though I`m and avid horror fan. This film (STRICKEN) is different and worth seeing. Oh, for the good old days when they knew how to make good horror."
1,Poor durability,"I would not recommend this product for outdoor use. I am writing this review approximately ten months after installing this product on my deck and it is completely disintegrating. I actually took it down this evening because I was tired of cleaning chunks of it out of my yard.For the cost and time it takes to install, I would definitely consider other alternatives. The reason I installed this product is b/c there is a large gap at the bottom of my railing that we were concerned our son could fit through. I will now be installing new balusters -- yes, at a higher cost, but I could have put the $100+ I wasted on this product toward the new lumber."
4,Not my favourite in the series...but still good,"As the title says...but still an excellent book. The entire series and especially the best books in it really immerse you in the story lines and this does it exceptionally well. I really liked the development of the relationship with Molly and the fairie queen character was a classic. My advice: read it; if you haven't read any of the Books of Magic before its a great introduction, and if you have read some of the other books...its a great addition."
3,"A minor, but decent, contribution.","John Ney Rieber, The Books of Magic: Summonings (DC Comics, 1996)After the first story in the Books of Magic series was complete, Neil Gaiman vanished, leaving the series in the hands of writer John New Rieber. That is not entirely a bad thing, but it's not a great one, either.While Summonings is still good reading, the gap in quality between the first collection and this one is noticeable. The stories here are far more unconnected, disjointed, and episodic than those in the first collection, with only Tim to hold them together as a coherent whole.That said, if you look at this more as a series of vignettes designed to give a little insight into Tim's character, rather than as a complete story arc, you'll probably enjoy it more. ***"
3,"The first half is good, the second half, not so good.","Here is the second collection of ""The Books of Magic"" regular series, containing issues 5-13. Although BOM was created by Neil Gaiman, you will quickly figure out that he did not write this little ditty.The first story arc, ""Sacrifices"" is pretty good stuff. In it we see a possible future evil version of Tim Hunter who wants to make sure that Tim follows the wrong path so that his version will actually exist in the future. Sounds like writer John Ney Rieber may have made contributions to The Terminator's movie continuity.The other stories in this edition range from good to fair. Do not have huge expectations and you won't be dissapointed. This is simply a decent read, nothing more, nothing less."
4,Great,"This is a great CD I like all the songs. Nek is a great singer, can't wait to have the italian version of this CD."
4,Where is this CD in Italian on Amazon?,"I have to be one more voice begging for the Italian verson of this album. The guy is Italian, and really needs to be heard in such. So if any one invovled in ordering for Amazon.com is reading this please know there are a lot of us that would like to order this CD in Italian, not just Spanish, from you!"
1,AMAZON. FLEX SOME MUSCLE TO GET ITALIAN VERSION,"Hey, Amazon. A big company like you can certainly get the ITALIAN version of this CD!! Nek is Italian, for crying out loud.We are not going to accept his do-it-in-Spanish-to-reach-the-big-market as a substitute!FILIPPO NEVIANI, en arte ""Nek,"" give us a break. Don't pass this Spanish version off as YOUR music! Come on."
3,Not as good as the later book,"I purchased this book while I was ""finding"" the perfect quilt to make for my new grandchild and did not find it in its pages. The later book has given me many ideas for quilts but not this one."
1,Fake Wenger Sport Watch,"This watch purports to be a real Wenger product. When it broke after about six months, I sent it to Wenger for repair under the one-year warranty. Wenger told me that it was NOT one of their watches. They were able to replace the movement for me (for a fee) and they also told me that they could not guarantee the water resistance it stated it was capable of, as it was not their product. I had bought the watch to use as a dive watch and now can't trust it for that purpose. I ended up giving it away and buying a REAL dive watch from a reputable dealer."
1,not pleased,"the shorts above that I ordered did not arrive, I received blk army shorts without pockets and no star, just the word army"
2,Undecided...,I bought this DVD because every year my 8th grade English/Literature students read The Circuit and Breaking Through by Francisco Jimenez and I was looking for a documentary that showed what life was like for a laborer. There are no videos available that depict what life is like traveling the circuit looking for crops to pick. This was the closest I found to the subject. It depicts Jamaican workers in the east coast and there is a short piece showing what it is like for a Mexican Immigrant out of work and down on his luck. Not exactly what I was looking for but I used the short pieces in between my lecture and the end interview with the director was interesting. I am not sure if my students got anything out of it. Not terribly memorable. I think the title is a bit misleading...Si Se Puede implies more of a Latino influence in the videos and there wasn't much of that.
5,"Absolutely wonderful, worth it's price...","Return to Paradise was my first live Styx album, and it introduced me to Styx music completely. ""On My Way"" gets you moving right from the start, followed by the powerful song, ""Paradise"". These are two of the three new tracks featured on this '97 release. From there, we are taken back to the ""hits"", with the ever-familiar show opener ""Rockin' the Paradise"". Live, these guys can ROCK! No doubt, all through disc 1, and on to disc 2, it's new, but familiar. The song ""Show Me The Way"" is very emotional. Personally, this song is much better than the original. ""Renegade"" rocks like never before, and at the end of disc 2, we find the last new song, ""Dear John"". Written by Tommy Shaw, it is a very powerful tribute to the late drummer. This is a must get for any fan."
5,Dennis Deyoung's Last Great Styx Album,"If you thought Dennis could not keep up with Styx one last time you where wrong. I know this review is a bit late, but I as a Late Styx listener have learned to respect and enjoy the early Styx years, and miss it today. This album captures those early years with that satin voice of Dennis DeYoung and the great musical work of Styx together at the Paradise. I thought at first this album was not going to cut it, but it began to grow on me and it will for you. Trust me it is worth every penny you spend on it, and will be for years to come."
1,Sorry Styx! It just isn't your day in paradise.,"When I first rushed to the record store to buy this album I prayed that it be better than ""Caught in the act"". It was not. And let me make one thing clear: I love Styx, and have most of their studio albums. The album contains some sentimental moments, like ""Dear John"". But apart from this memorial song the album is of no value what so ever. Styx just doesen't seem to fix live recordings. It's ""Caught in the act"" all over again, only worse. To a Styx fan this is hell in paradise!"
2,return to paradise,Barely able to recognise the song's not much likewhat I thought they sound like when I first heard them onthe radio
4,Worth reading,"Sure this isn't Sagans best book, it was one of his earliest. But its definitely a great read, full of profound thoughts."
1,A DULL DISAPPOINTMENT,"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FILMS THAT MAKES ME WONDER, ""WHAT WERE ALL THOSE CRITICS THINKING?"" WHAT DID THEY SEE IN THIS UTTERLY DULL PIECE OF CINEMA THAT I MISSED?I DON'T WANT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY I GAVE IT TWO STARS:1) YOU'LL SEE A YOUNG CHLOE SEVIGNY COMPLETELY NUDE. (MAY HAVE GIVEN THE FILM 2 1/2 STARS IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE SUCH A BONY BUTT)2) YOU'LL DEFINITELY WONDER IF THE BOY BILL MURRAY MET AT THE END WAS HIS SON OR NOT.IF YOU CAN MAKE IT TO THE END OF THIS PICTURE, WHICH IS A STRUGGLE, YOU WILL THINK OF ALL THE OTHER BETTER MOVIES YOU COULD HAVE BEEN WATCHING.YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!"
3,Alexis Dziena the high point of this one,"I got this DVD admittedly purely for the Alexis Dziena eye candy she consistently delivers in anything I've ever seen her in, regardless of her state of dress. This is one of the few movies she appears fully nude, frontal and ""backal"". However one must ask, first... why the shoes?! And secondly, did they really hire her simply for that one scene just to get the R rating? Seems a terrible waste of talent to me. Other than her appearance, the film is fairly engaging in a dark and understated Woody Allen-esque sort of way. Overall a very good story line and well acted throughout, though in the end I was left saying ""huh?""."
1,Broken Endings,"THIS MOVIE HAD A GOOD PLOT THAT FELL OFF THE END OF A TABLE AND DIED ... WHAT A HORRIBLE ENDING ... I KNEW IT WAS COMING BUT WAS STILL APPALLED... I FIND THAT THE OMISSION OF LOCATIONS,STATES,CITIES ... FOR ME ... WAS A HUGE MISTAKE ... I WAS HOPING IT WAS THE DEAD GIRL FRIEND WHO WROTE THE LETTER BEFORE SHE DIED... SINCE THEY SHOWED NO DATE ON HER HEAD STONE ... A WASTE OF MY TIME ... AFTER THE FIRST HOUR ..."
3,damaged america,"As in his set-in-Japan movie whose title I forget, Murray again plays a mid-aged American who is successful only financially and who now sleepwalks through life as an emotional failure. As this persona looks up a handful of flames from 20 years back in an attempt to figure which of them may have had a child by him, he finds that his former women too are damaged or wacked out, no matter if they are married or single, rich or poor. The only people who seem to be happy in this film are Murray's neighbors from Ehtiopia. The husband especially is full of life, for all his five kids and three jobs. So what, the film seems to ask, is wrong with America? Very low key, but a terrific soundtrack."
1,There was no end to this story,"This movie kept you interested through out the whole movie, there were twists and turns and you wanted to solve the mystery. But at the end of the movie, you realized you wasted your time watching this movie.....there was no ending or mystery solved, it left you hanging. It was very dissapointing and because of that I will not waste my time watching this movie again."
3,Is truly an adult movie,"Bill Murray plays an aging Don Juan who goes looking for an possibly illegitimate son he just found out about about through the mail anonymously. He has a friend who wants to be a detective who writes out a detailed itinerary for the road trip to find his son. Even gets him motel rooms and rental rooms. His ex-women are and interesting bunch. White trash trying to get to middle class status, a aging yuppie into suburban real estate with her husband, an ""animal whisperer"" and a tough redneck woman.Bill Murray does his role deadpan all the way through through movie but it seems right. If you are patient and open minded you may enjoy this film. It's for mature people who has seen a bit of life."
5,Jim Jarmusch - At his Best !!!,"Jim Jarmusch has made many wonderful films during his career. Since the very beginning he has established a new style and point of view. There aren't many filmmakers and storytellers that really deliver such creative work as he does. Broken Flowers is a wonderful film, full of magic, full of surprises, full of Jarmusch, and full of Bill Murray. It's a pleasure, from the very beginning to the very end, and even more, it leaves a wonderful aftertaste. It's a film that does not fade away, like most. It gets stronger and stronger in time. A must.J.J.Harting - Santiago, Chile"
3,Watch it but do not buy it.,"I have been a big fan of Bill Murray, but this movie just didnt have the last artistic movement that I felt with ""Lost In Translation."" I do have to say that the movie was interesting, certainly did not like how it ends but interesting. My thoughts are as my title. Good movie to watch but do not buy it. Unfortunately I bought it. My bad. :("
2,Amazed at how un-entertaining this movie was.,"I don't know what to say about this movie other than it was extreaming boring and un-entertaining. I was quite suprise considering all the glowing reviews when the movie was first released into theaters. Murray plays a depressed late lifer. I'd say midlife except Murray is actually 55 but looks more like 65 in this film. His character Don Johnston has seemingly lived (and continues to live) the life of the carefree playboy sleeping with various women (most of whom are 20 years younger). Now he gets an anonymous letter claiming he has a son who is trying to find him. There is very little laughter, mostly serious moments. This may sound crazy but at times I got the impression Murray was bored with doing this movie. As if he was painfully sitting through some of the seens hoping the director would hurry and get it over with so he could go home and do other things. Don't waste your money."
2,interesting and a bore,"Interesting acting by Stone, Swinton, Wright, Lange and others. Murray is a disappointment however: no verve, barely alive. While he's the nexus with the other characters, in the end he contributes little to the story. Acting aside this is like watching paint dry or contemplating your navel."
3,"Good movie, but get a personality.","This is a thoughtful movie, could have been a great movie if Bill Murray would drop the affectless acting and start acting human again. He was always kind of laid back as an actor, even as a comic, but the energy is gone from his screen presence and it can actually make you tired to watch him. It's old, and it just didn't suit this character, who is successful and therefore must have some energy somewhere, even if he's not emotionally involved with anyone.The girlfriends were great, the kooky but serious Jessica Lange, the angry Tilda Swinton, and the sweet Sharon Stone with Lolita her daughter. It was really fun to see these veteran actresses give life to their characters in brief but stunning cameos.This movie is recommended for a rainy day. Don't build a Saturday night at home around it. The lower your expectations, the more pleased you will be."
1,Worst Movie of the Year,"Horrible. Overrated. A complete waste of time. It's like eating stale bread for almost two hours!!! By the time you're finished you feel like throwing up. If Jim Jarmusch was a painter he would be one of those artists that paints a canvas black and calls it art. There is absolutely no life in this movie and this is nothing more than a black canvas painting. Absolute garbage, and the saddest thing is that people fall into the trap of calling this art. ""It really makes you think""...please!! Stop thinking about it because your head might explode."
2,A tough one to watch,"This is one of those films that you either roll with, or you don't. I found it a failure on nearly every level, but can at least say that it has a distinctive style that elevates it above 1-star fare. I enjoyed director Jarmusch's ""Mystery Train,"" but struggled to make it through this one -- cutting 15 minutes might have helped considerable; the long scenes that Jarmusch constructs had me begging for an edit.The acting was competent, but I didn't see the greatness in it that many critics did. Only Tilda Swinton registered strongly. Bill Murray seems to be doing this type of character to death recently, and while he does have a few classic moments, they are way too far and few between.The film does step it up a little in the final 15 minutes, but by then it's too little, too late. 2005 was a disappointingly lackluster year for indie fare, and this film is, unfortunately, another letdown."
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"Excellent film. The ending may leave a bit to be desired, whether or not you are able to appreciate the director leaving the ending open to interpretation.Plenty has been said already, in terms of summarizing the film. Classic Bill Murray, and the supporting cast are all on-point. Even though Jeffrey Wright sounded as if he was from Pakistan instead of Jamaica, his performance was superb."
3,Broken Flowers,The start of it was boring and it is depressing to watch for those who just broke up with their mates.
2,No plot,"No plot, but good characters...and in the end the combination adds up to nothing but frustration and irresolution. There's absolutely no ending.I hate how it's become this ""cool"" thing recently for movies to completely cut off with no end (Squid and the Whale, others) and everyone acts like it's this realistic, zen thing. I think it's the directors' lack of vision."
1,music is life,"I rented it - I won't buy it.Acting? I think not. I give it less than one star, which is not an option."
3,Johnston with a T,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. It is very understated as is Bill Murrays performance but I still enjoyed it and the subject matter. This is not a real feel good movie. It deals with regrets and past loves lost. It also deals with going back and confronting your past and what you left behind and really if you are not better off leaving the past in the past. Don is a sad character and time has past him by. He is what he is and suddenly he gets a letter that makes him question who he is, how he has lived his life and that he may have a grown child out there that he doesnt even know about.This movie is kind of a downer but is worth a look."
2,"After the first half hour, it was all downhill","This film had a great cast, and I really expected it to be a good movie. The main character, Don (Bill Murray),gets an anonymous letter stating that he has a nineteen year old son. Then he goes and visits all of his ex-girlfriends from the 70's in order to find the one that fathered his child. It started off well, the characters were quirky and it there were some pretty funny parts. However, after he visits his first two ex girlfriends, the movie really started to drag and most of the scenes had no significance to the story at all. Also, it had no ending! This movie just leaves the audience feeling unfulfilled and confused."
5,Not your typical comedy,"I'm a fan of Jim Jarmusch's simplistic, real life shooting style. And that's what this is. If I be so bold as to call it ""real life comedy"". There's no over the top scenarios in the Hollywood sense. The story is a little bleak, yet for some reason it appeals to me. Think ""Lost in Translation"". Bill Murray is a master at being depressed yet still making you smile. This movie is also accompanied by a great soundtrack.No, this movie isn't hilarious but it's a great movie with many different emotions and left open to many different interpretations. It's worth watching."
1,One word - SUCKS,"I almost turned it off in the first 30 mins but I thought I would see if it got better. It never did. The movied ended without any answers and huge holes in the plot left open. Who paid to produce this hunk of junk? Sorry Bill. Been a fan since SNL but this is garbage. For everyone else, dont waste your time."
2,Poor -,"My first point - Bill Murray's performance detracts from the film. He's a 'downer' from start to finish. Second, the ending is terrible - Murray has met a young boy that might be his son. Murray repels the boy by asserting that he knows the boy is looking for his father. Boy runs off. End of movie. What was the point? 3)The entire movie, start to finish, is boring. It's about Murray looking for a woman who might have born his son 19 years ago, and at the same time that 19-year-old looking for his father."
1,Broken Actors,"I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life. If that's what it takes to make a film, I'm going to change my career goal and become a director. The movie doesn't even deserve 1 star."
1,Yikes!,"Is Bill Murray depressed or what? I almost slit my own wrist while watching this incredibly boring movie, just so i would be spared from having to finish it. What is going on with Bill Murray these days? Is he stuck in some kind of artistic movie making hell? Do what you do best Bill...be funny.This hogwash just doesn't cut it."
1,Waste of time!,"This movie is soooo boring! I dont understand why Jim Jarmusch keeps showing these boring scenes where you see Bill Murray, lying, sitting, being on the plane, driving or whatever and just nothing happens. with all those scenes out, the movie would have been half as long. That way i would have only wastes 45 minutes of my life, cause the rest isnt much better. Especially the end pissed me off. I guess they run out of money so they just stopped filming..."
1,Don't Bother!,"I love Bill Murray but this movie is sooooo bad. It is boring, slow and has an ending that will leave you absolutely puzzled. I strongly do not recommend this movie."
1,What Dreck,"I was quite let down by this movie. I had high hopes: Bill Murray; Jim Jarmusch, etc. But it just prods along with the hope of reaching some resolution in the end which never comes. Sharon Stone is very good but it doesn't make this movie worth watching."
1,Lets get real...,"I could not stomach another second of this movie...Bill Murray is not what he used to be...yes actors have to grow with time ( it is expected) but what he has done in the last 8 years is nothing more than become this actor who just sits there, thinking that he is going to get laughs just because he is Bill Murray. He shows zero feeling when he is acting, there seems to be nothing there....gather to guess that in his heyday, he may have done too many drugs or something. Ever since Osmosis Jones, his acting has not been something that I seek out. Terrible, not even worth a chuckle or anything in this case. Yuck!!!"
2,ground hog murray,"Really went in expecting a smart, sophisticated story like Lost In Translation. What it is is a very inferior movie with Bill trying hard not to be trying hard. He takes the low key style that worked perfectly in Lost and mangles it. Sorry Bill, unlike Ground Hog Day, you can't just rehash the same role over and over again. Has it's moment - too bad it doesn't make up enough of it to salvage the movie. One thing that is very good - the soundtrack!By the way, I think a lot of viewers missed the point of the ending."
3,it's ok,"Although the movie itself is interesting, well performed, engaging and mostly excellent, it just fails at the end. I was left wanting for a real ending"
3,Broken movie,"I was excited to see this movie as I love Rushmore and wasmoderately pleased with Lost in T. Although the movie startsout well with the ever cynical Murray in his dark apartmentwith choice music and the intrigue of his sleuthing friend,the movie goes nowhere afterwards. Just the repetition ofthe 4 plane/car trips, and the quirky old-flames that addalmost zero humor and just detract from any focus the storyhad. The ending is somewhat sensible (as it shows he's learnednothing), but also lackluster. In total, although Murrayis excellent at playing the cynical, nothing-to-lose character,it is getting a bit dull seeing him trod through storiesexclusively in this roll, especially when the script is ratherlacking."
1,Staring at drying paint - would be more interesting!,"This is another of Murray's catatonic performances, in a plot that might be worthy of a 20 minute short subject, but is stretched into a full length movie mainly thanks to his ability to sit in a stuporous state with a lobotomized stare - one always expects to see him raise his hand to be excused to the boy's room. Sharon Stone's career must be at rock bottom to bag a cameo role in this stinker.If you can read something into this film, then you must be able to devine tea leaves or stare at a monotone paiting and see Breugel.I wouldn't have watched this for free, and showing it to detainees at Gitmo would peg the torture scale.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, LET ALONE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!"
2,These flowers wilted before they broke,"Here, an interesting idea is hamstrung by glacial pacing and Bill Murray's hangdog expression - which never varies throughout the film. By the end of the film, it doesn't matter if Don finds the mother of his son, or if there really is a son to begin with; but you wish there was some sort of payoff to reward you for investing 100 minutes of your time."
2,what movie were other reviewers at?,"in contrast to other reviewers, I found this movie extremely missable - kept waiting for it to move past its deadly slow pace and basically unbelievable story line. By the end of the movie I (and all friends who have also seen it) wished I had saved both my time and money.Give it a complete miss."
3,Interesting Character study,"I can't decide whether Murray's performance is effortless or lazy. I kept looking for this ""Don Juan"" to show up and I just didn't see what made him such a lady's man. I found his neighbor Winston interesting. I thought his love for mysteries endearing, plus, he seemed to know Don better than he knew himself. As much as I found the subject matter interesting, the pacing can try the average viewer. It was just a bit too slow for my taste and I really don't care for open endings like this. But there are some things to like about the production."
1,Jarmusch loses the plot...,"Don't believe the hype people - just because it's a Jarmusch movie does not entail it's brilliant by that fact alone. The cracks were starting to appear in ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" - about half the stories in that film should've ended up on the cutting room floor.Bill Murray was playing the role he's always played but to the nth degree. His character was dull dull dull - maybe that was the point but I don't watch films to be bored to death. Further there was a scene with an attractive nymphette (daughter of one of his ex-lovers) coming on to him in a big way - totally unbelievable. Bill's nearly geriatric, he sure ain't no stud, and his character had all the charisma of a dead fish. This film was completely self-indulgent and looked as though Jarmusch was showing off the ""A"" he got in Symbolism 101. Stultifyingly predictable."
1,Broken Murray,"It's sad to see how desparate Bill Murray has become in his pursuit of the Oscar. His new mantra appears to be ""the more obtuse, the better"" as he has moved from bad to worse in his last several movies. He plays the same comatose, walking-through-life-without-purpose vegetable that he started in Lost in Translation; with less connective tissue. Murray's ""Don Johnston"" is hardly a convincing Don Juan, as he walks through life with a perma-frown borne from a life with less purpose then EuroDisney in France. The best part of the movie is when Murray's character gets knocked out flat. It's just-desserts for the formerly funny and talented actor, who has sold the last few years of his life for trite material in the pursuit of respectability. It's too bad because he used to be respectable, in my estimation."
2,oh please.,"this film is an insult to my intelligence as a viewer. i'm supposed to think blank vapid staring represents angst; stilted, cryptic dialogue equals deep thought (obviously too deep for my poor brain); and faulty plotting is mystery and drama instead? and it's classified as a comedy? guess i was dozing during the funny parts."
2,Half a movie,"I generally like Jarmusch's work and I was very disappointed in this movie.I thought this movie took the concept of ""spare"" much too far in terms of plot. I found the film lacked sufficient cohesion to make it the gem it could have been. When the credits rolled, I found myself saying ""Huh? What happened?""...and not in a good way.There are some sweet moments and bits of lovely performance work. That doesn't make a movie for me. If you are a Tilda Swinton fan, please know she is almost unrecognizable in this film. There is a lot of acting fire power here but for me it just did not add up."
1,What a scam!,"Images that have changed our lives, with no images! Just captions - 1 per page. It looks like the ""author"" (using that term as loosely as possible) didn't want to pay royalties to include the actual images. This is so insulting it's offensive."
1,waste of paper,"People actually paid $5.95 for a copy of...NOTHING? I'd like to commend the author for, well, picking a font and bottom-center justifying a small handful of words....244 times. Hats off to you, sir.I'm writing a book now. It's a book about paper, only I'm not going to use paper. At least my book won't be a giant waste.I tried to give this 0 stars, but Amazon won't allow that.Don't buy this. Fold 122 pages of blank printer paper in half. At least you'll get some exercise. Just remember to unfold that paper and use it afterwards."
5,Great For Mommies!!,"I bought this bag, because I am a working mom, and I am always feeling like a bag lady, carrying my purse, my lunch bag, and my son's diaper bag. I wanted something that was not small, but also not huge. It needed to be stylish for me to take to work, but could also be used for everyday use. This bag does all of that. I am able to place all my personal things, and have room to put my lunch inside. There is also enough room, where I can add some snack, drink bottle, and extra diapers for my little one. I mainly use it as a shoulder strap; adjustable straps do not work well as when you convert it to a backpack. However, the ability to do so is a great asset when you need the extra hand or waist when you need to carry your little one. I don't recommend this for people who need to carry heavy items like school books; as I could see how the straps can break. I especially recommend for mommy's with little once, and don't want to carry a purse and a diaper bag."
5,Chestnut Brown Leather Three-way Backpack,"When I received this backpack, I think it was the most beautiful and handy backpack I'd ever seen! I'm an artist so if I travel or just paint outdoors, this backpack can hold all of my art materials. If I need to stay overnight somewhere for 1 or 2 days, this backpack has enough room for my clothes and enough compartments for all of my other stuff. And the great part is: it was very affordable."
1,DON'T BUY,"I bought bag for my son, but he didn't like it. When I called customer service, I was told that I must give order number to return. There was not a conventional invoice in package. So I was told to look for invoice number on mailing label. I could not find it. Perhaps UPS covered it with their label. So I wrote to website and computer told me it did not exist. Therefore, I cannot return item. I'll save it as present for someone else."
5,Perfect,"I haven't used the lens much yet, but as with all things I buy I test it to be sure it works...very happy sofar and looking forward to taking many amazing photos. Still new to the game and this lens seems to fit my needs and price budget."
2,it's ok i guess....,"if you're looking for an inexpensive solution to get 200mm, then i guess this is a winner.if you expect to have a reasonably sharp photo at 200mm then you will be disappointed.it's a fine lens until you rack it out. then the photo just falls apart."
4,It Is A Skateboard...,"Essentially that means, that it does what it should for the price. It is nice to have, but it doesn't do you much good indoors. The ""steering"" is a little loose on the focus and in auto focus mode it takes too long to ""find"" the image. Expect to use a tripod and be patient with your shots, otherwise you're going to get a bunch of fuzzy stuff. Spend a little extra and get the vibration reduction model."
4,Great lens,"This lens is great for my amateur photography. Only complaint is that the shutter speed is a little slower than I would like, but still takes amazingly clear photos."
2,"Decent images, but extremely low build quality.","This is a very light lens.Absolutely no type of metal is usedin the construction of this lens.Even the mount is plastic so beware of thatwhen purchasing this.I highly recommend not ever dropping this lensif you do then there went your 109$.I would pay more to have the 18-200 vr.with better build quality, vr, and wider angle."
4,Great store not so great lens for a D3000,Great store and fast shipping. I guess an okay lens but not for a D3000 check out the other lenses that the store sells. This one didn't reduce the shaking at all even with my tripod. I checked it online and many photographers agree that its not a well made lens.
5,Great Value,"Perfect companion to the Nikon 18-55mm lens provided with the d40x I purchased. While the VR would be nice, I wasn't ready to drop an additional 2 bills. I bought mine used and have no regrets about this purchase."
5,Great Affordable Lens,"OK, I've never used a lens that cost upward of $900 to know the differences between them. I'm sure to the professional photographer who uses them regularly, this lens would be inferior. However, for the rest of us, this lens is great. It is fairly light and sharp and not too slow. For the money, it's a steal."
4,A Great Add to your Camera Bag,"I use this lens more than I use the 18-55mm. This is a better lens for portraits so that you aren't up into somebody's personal business. I was able to take a picture of a plane in the sky, and though I could not zoom in on all the details with the lens, I could crop the image on my d5000 and still print the cropped image at a 18x20. And see the details. I noticed a little noise on completely zoomed in images if they are cropped, but I love this lens. It does not have VR (vibration reduction) so hold your hand steady, or use a tripod for slower shutter speeds. If you need to go out with your camera and can't lug around your bag of lenses, take this one. It gets the job done. But remember, just because you can zoom way close, this is NOT a macro lens..."
3,slow focus,I own a D200 and adquire the 55-200mm.I'm little disapointed because the lens it's not fast and acurate for focusing.If you compare with the 18-70mm its a turtle.And difficult to use in sports or movenmnet objects.
1,Mistaken identity...twice,"The lens pictured on the website page when I originally ordered is not the lens Amazon sent. Nor was its replacement, despite repeated e-mails over nearly a month pointing out the discrepancy. All they've done is replace the web page photo in the last few days. I am still waiting for Amazon to send the lens pictured when I first ordered."
2,Not the lens I thought I was buying,"This lens came with the 2 lens kit so I'm not sure what I paid for it. I only know it is a nikon and I expected much more from it. It is light and cheesy feeling. It does not focus well, it just tries and tries to the point that I take it off and use another lens. Mine is marked ""made in china"", maybe that explains it. I am not happy at all with this lens and I feel like I have been taken for a ride. It is not even close to the quality of the other lens in the kit. I thought it was defective until I have read the other reviews on this lens, I should have read them before I bought the kit. The D70s is great and the 18-70mm lens is very good too. Don't waste your money on this lens."
3,Focus is very slow,Pros:- Very light weight lens- Pictures are sharp and have good contrast- Silent focusCons:- The lens takes a long time to focus. Much slower than the 18-70mm lens that came with my D70.
3,Good Value Lens,"This lens gets three stars for value and optical performance. It would get four stars if not for the recently released VR version (five stars for value and performance) (definately get the VR version over this one). It is a sharp lens; however, it hunts a lot in low light, and the plastic build makes for a flimsy lens when fully extended."
3,Decent zoom lens for the price,"I've had this lens for about 4 years, I got it about the same time I got the D50. I wanted it to compliment the 18-55mm lens that came with the camera. Zooming into 200 mm when I'm taking a photo of an object that is fairly close turns out pretty good and low and high speeds, but if the object is still a decent distance away, there is a bit of ""noise"" and the picture isn't as sharp--even if I'm holding the camera steady and I'm using a fast shutter speed. Having a lens with VR technology would be a good upgrade. I also have the 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens and it's a much better lens.I guess in a nutshell I'd say this lens is good for the price, but if you can spend a little more, go with the 55-200 with the VR technology, you'll get ""better bang for your buck"".Also, get a clear UV filter, if for no other reason than to protect the lens."
5,In perfect working condition,This is just the lens I needed. I recently ordered a 55-300mm lens but didn't realize at the time that it did not have autofocus for my Nikon D3000. This lens has since become its replacement.The lens arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect working condition.
2,Not worth the price.,"While my daughter (almost 5yrs) loves her new ""baby"", it isn't worth the price. I can find a doll half that price at Target. The ""crying"" is just a big mess to clean up and as for going ""potty"", that is not even worth the hassel! We got my daughter the Baby Born wooden highchair, but the baby sits up in it and she has to be slightly laying down in order to feed her!! Doesn't make sense to build a highchair that can't be used with the doll! As for the ""sqeeling with excitment"" it is literall just a squeek!! Like a dog toy would make!! While the doll is adorable and my daughter seems to enjoy playing with her, I would look for something else. The only plus is that it doesn't use batteries and it can be taken into the tub."
3,Quality Album,"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I can't say every song was great, but if you are a fan of Jodeci, or even just K-Ci, you will like this album."
2,A slow moving book,"On his first solo release, Kci still shows he can BLOW & SANG but without big name producers the release doesn't show his full potential. The disc starts off with a standrard calling out the haters track called My Book. After that the disc is pretty much by the numbers R&B. Kci does shine on two tracks which are Conversation (Can I Talk 2 U) and Much Too Soon.Much Too Soon featured Al B.Sure & Aaron Hall and all three singers sounds as good as they did when they were in their prime. I wish that Kci had a bigger budget so he could work with big producers such as Babyface, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis or even hook up with fresh talent like The Underdogs & Stargate. Buy this CD for the vocals and not the production."
1,J,"I had different expectations for this album, so I was completely surprised by the topics of the songs. I wasn't expecting K-Ci to be singing about the hood, ghetto women, and something about a thug. What I was expecting was more songs like Conversation and Woman's Gotta Have It. This album is a far stray from the albums with Jo Jo and a much farther stray from the Jodeci days. The lyrics are disappointing. Hey, but you decide for yourself. It seems like more people than not likes this album. You can have mine."
2,Egyptian Tomatos????,"This is not a serious book for a serious historical recreationist! The author doesn't restrict himself to historically accurate recipes or ingredients. He suggests Babylonian tomato paste? Sliced Egyptian tomatos in a salad? (Tomatos are a New World ingredient). Imaginary ""lead"" cookware is an added distraction! (Did you ever try heating a lead pot?)The author says his inspiration was various Hollywood movies and Classic Comics. He also admits he knows that his stuff isn't accurate, but it is created to give a feel for the cuisine. The recipes will be different than what you probably are accustomed to eating, but historically accuracy is less than excellent. I would use this for making a high school ""feast"" but serious re-enactors and living historians can give this book a miss."
5,Paz Vega WAS Carmen,"A very good telling of the story behind the opera, only, I missed not having the music from the opera. Still a good story. I also enjoyed Katerina Witt's Carmen On Ice. I like the story. Paz Vega WAS Carmen, I got her fire and her desperate life force. Good stuff."
4,"Should read ""based on Mérimeé's short story""","This film is an almost line-by-line retelling of Prosper Mérimée's short story Carmen, which, decades later, became the source of Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy's libretto for Bizet's opera. The American DVD edition cover dutifully dumbs this down for our consumption: ""based on Bizet's wildly popular opera"".So much for ignorant marketing! At least, we get an anamorphic transfer -the Spanish edition is woefully letterboxed!Superb photography, beautiful actual locations, and Ms Vega, who is not at all shy about performing head-to-toe, full frontally and rearly **clothed** in more than one scene!What an eyeful!"
4,A must!,"If you're a fan of Cafe Tacvba you must complete your collection with the Unplugged DVD. I enjoyed very much watching Los Tacvbos sing to a small group of well behaved people, very intimate.You'll end up wanting more of Them."
1,Beware!,If you have a printer with a roller-type operation do not buy this product. The pages split from themselves and create a massive jam and headache. Don't say you weren't warned.
5,Great Series -- Lot for the Money,This is a great series of the show and a lot of shows for the money. Quite happy to have it.
1,I got ripped off and never received this gift which was from Santa,"I ordered this DVD series at the beginning of December. I waited, then called, it was on the way they said and then found out it was sent to a home in Texas. Just make sure if you are buying anything on Amazon it says SHIPPED from Amazon and NOT from another company that is using Amazons website to sell their items. My little boy was so sad that Santa didn't bring the tapes he wanted. I was not to happy with this order and will think twice before I order things on line again."
1,Magnum P.I. second season,"I ordered these for a Christmas gift for my wife. The second disc of this season was bad and the replacemt was even worse. The second disc skips, freezes and is missing whole scenes. I am really disappointed."
5,Great for the $$$$$,"This was a great value at the time I purchased the series. Awesome price and very, very quick shipping!!!"
1,"Greatest Show Ever,...DVD is JUNK","Another reviewer, Mick Black from Cleveland had it right. The video skipped and stopped cold on a few episodes. I carefully cleaned the disks, and the same thing happened. It's a shame one of the great shows off all time is not given it's proper respect by Universal. I didn't expect a lot of ""extras,"" just the original episodes with no frills or technical problems. No such luck."
1,Felt cheated by quality,"I finally got around to watching this,(I watch these while exercising), and definitely felt cheated. The picture quality wasn't very good and there was actual picture breakup that was exactly like the breakup or freeze frame that happens when it's raining heavily and the satellite blanks out. These guys (suppliers) simply copied a TV production and made cheap copies. Good luck with yours."
1,Worked once,Wasn't impressed at all. Had problems getting it to work on my Win7 computer. Then it copied one disk.. Hasn't worked since. I wouldn't waste my money on another one.
1,Broke the first day of use!,"This broke the first day of use. It worked fine to read and format old disks but I plugged it in and it made a noise and then quit working. Windows can't recognize the drive anymore and it says there was a malfunction of the drive. So at least we did what we set out to do, reading and formatting old disks to throw them away. But the last time we tried to use it it failed. I would have bought a cheaper one had I known this was going to happen."
4,Subtitles have errors,"Maybe Viz really does want us to download Bleach instead of buying their dvd's? I just finished watching this dvd set tonight and there are several typos and grammatical errors in the subtitles. Guess what? The fansubs that are done by fans for free probably have better quality subtitles based on my experience with Naruto. The anime itself is 5 stars and the menus are cool, but there was obviously no proof reading done on the subs whatsoever. Just horrible."
4,a little disappointed,I just now got the package I was a little disappointed because when I got the package there was no poster and I got it brand new. One of my friends ordered this same one and he got the poster. Oh and no i don't only care about the poster. I was Just a little disappointed when there wasn't one.
2,Not much help,I bought this because someone I know used it on her hair and it was noticeably fuller. It didn't do a thing for my hair though.
4,Awesome Band - Ok Album,This band was completely awesome. Every show they played in Mobile was on fire. They had to have been the biggest thing in the music scene. Greg Slay (the drummer) of course went on to play for Remy Zero when he moved to Birmingham. This cd is good but their best would have to be LOWASFUK.
1,VERY entry level,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have a little experience with XML and have to admit I bought the book on impulse - I liked the title & was encouraged by some of the reviews. This book is not for anyone who has even *basic* knowledge of XML or the Web. There is a very long, very elementary description of how the Internet works, which I found odd in a book published in 2002.The XML & semantic web descriptions were very general and not original by any means. If you have a manager with a bit of a techie slant who, for some odd reason, does not understand the Internet or the potential of XML, this book might be perfect. There are better books and websites out there on both XML and the semantic web. Definitely a waste of my $$."
4,Broad overview of XML and the semantic web,"The author provides broad overview of the semantic web and XML. It gives a beginner some insights into the field. It does not go into depth on XML, but gives several references for the reader to find more information. It also takes a database perspective in discussing the semantic web rather than an artificial intelligence perspective. I find this aspect very interesting."
3,Six reviewl,"Some people will have you believe this cd is cr@p. This is only partly true. The cd starts with a great rocker (Big picture).Songs like 'nobody cares' and 'waiting for the night' are also good rockin' loverboy tunes and 'maybe someday' is a fantastic ballard. Sadly there is some ordinary material on this album which doesn't sound much like the loverboy we know. 'love or money', 'created a monster', and 'spinning my wheels' are not particularly memorable and not really what you would expect. Buy this is you're prepared to skip thru half of the songs but the album shouldn't be totally ignored, theres some excellent tracks mixed in."
3,NOT AS MEMORABLE AS THEIR EARLIER WORK!,"Believe me I don't think there was anyone mre excited to find out that one of the greastest rock bands of the 80's was back together(minus Doug)But unlike their previous albums where every song was perfect this new effort sadly doesn't seem to capture that quality.Although musically it does sound good and it's great to see that Mike's still got that golden voice,You just don't seem to walk away from it remembering the tunes like you used to."
2,I tried SO hard to like this record . . .,"Loverboy was basically my reason for drawing breath in high school, and I found this album in the stores at a time when I was waxing nostalgic. As Dilbert says, ""I ask for so little, and boy, do I get it."" A great many of the songs sound like leftovers, and with a couple of exceptions (most notably the pretty acoustic ballad ""Maybe Someday""), Loverboy seems to be just going through the motions. They're still a fun band to see live, but this record sounds like an attempt to cash in on their renewed success as a road act. Only for the most absolute die-hard fan."
4,Kind of messy,"The only down side to this product is that it is very thick. My dog was to the point where she would not eat anything much less lick something like this, so I had to put it on a spoon and force feed her. Needless to say it got pretty messy and it hardens on the face when it dries. So had to do many face washings. I still use it when I need to. It is a very good product."
2,Maybe I got a bad batch.,"Well I got it and immediately went to use it.. a bunch of gunk came out. Kinda like if you dont shake ketchup, but it was an EXAGGERATED amount. Like 2 tablespoons. (Is it supposed to be brown, btw?) So I squished it around a bit but there was no way to get it to mesh together. He didnt want the treat I gave him , he kept trying to get a different one. Then last night I heard him gargling and he threw up weird brownish liquid. Darker than the NutriStat. He hasnt really been acting weird but Ill monitor for a few days. :/I wonder why my dog canned it on day 3 but everyone else loved it? And was mine defective?"
5,used for a year now,We have several older cats who were very thin when rescued. They beg for this stuff. We ran out for over a month and we won't let that happen again. The cats began losing weight. Not to mention the begging any time we came near where the Nutrastat was kept. We're now using it on 2 puppies. We always order from KV Pets because there's a smaller shipping charge and delivery is fast. This is a must have for your pet.
5,Perfect for babies and small children,My mom had this for us when we were very young and I still remember the songs. Perfect for babies and small children!
2,Queen,If you are looking for a bland immaculate version of queen songs then this is the album for you. Originally labeled on the amazon site as David Bowie and Queen I purchased the album. I was hoping this might be full of collaborative gems between the group and Bowie. To my dismay it is the London Symphony playing Queen. While the music is good it is just not something that I would keep. Off to the delete bin for this one.
2,Really?,"Well, as live shows go...this would be a ""2"" with some ""6"" around the middle and heading back to ""2"" through the end.Jani wasn't even trying to sing through most of this, not even trying...and we all know that you don't listen to Warrant because of the irreplaceable band members right?Bummer. Crossing my fingers that the rest of my Warrant selections come in and sound great. This one, uh, not so much folks."
4,Cool!,"Warrant live,this CD is actually from one concert in 96.Many good songs made it on the CD,but there are many good songs that didn't make it also.The sound is as good as most live albums have.My only complaint is that some of the songs are incomplete,they perform a portion of a song,then they go into another song.Good CD for fans,casuall listeners should get Cherry Pie,DRFSR,or The Best of Warrant to start out with."
2,weak,"I felt cheated when I heard this recording of Warrant live. The quality that I expected just wasn't there. Suffice to say, this is a band best when heard from the studio."
1,This really sucks,"What the hell is wrong with Warrant? This album is first of all missing Big Talk, Bed Of Roses, and Mr. Rainmaker, and second of all Heaven and Sometimes She Cries are each about 2 minutes long... where the hell are last halfs of the songs Jani? Don't ever by this album if you know what is good for you. Just by DRFSR and Cherry Pie, they are Warrants only good albums."
3,Safe for Cats?,I can't tell if this is specifically for pets. Please be aware that cats need cod liver oil with reduced vitamin A. I see nothing on this oil to indicate that is pet forumula. Please be careful!
5,Return buyer!,I love this product for our dogs! It is such a good value compared to the others online I have found.
4,Good songs that wet the palette for the new album,"Mobscene is an amazing song, both lyrically and musically. And if you close your eyes and MAYBE squint a little, you can see the cabaret girls dancing, the absinthe bottles lying around, and the dancing.Paranoiac is a completely different style then his previous works, and really makes me curious as to what the remainder of the album will sound like. It very much resembles a slow MDFMK song, which makes sense seeing as how Tim Skold is their new bassist and helped produce the majority of the album.I came to see the mobscene, and I wasn't dissapointed."
5,The new manson!,"this is one of manson best CD singles released.I mean it has tainted love. mOBSCENE. Paranoiac. and one more i think. Ive been i long time manson fan and his new sound is diferent,alot more but not for the worse he sounds good but im going to finish this now but this cd will hold you down till tgaog is released so enjoy till then!?!?!?!"
4,love mobscene but...,"love this song, but its sounds very close to Faith No More's ""be Agressive"" anyone else?"
3,Sadly Mediocre,"Like many of you reading this review, I've been waiting quite some time to hear the ""new"" sound of Marilyn Manson. Well, I'm still waiting. This first single from ""The Golden Age of the Grotesque"" sounds like the same old Manson, as if it were a cut track from ""Mechanical Animals."" It's not that it's a bad song, it's just a let-down considering all the hype around the new album. The other song is a remix of another song from new album and it's pretty much there for the sake of being there.I really hope this is just a ""pop"" song that was released just to get radio play. If the rest of the album is anything like this single, many fans will be severely disappointed."
2,"Half good, half...well...not good","This manual is great except for the Metroid Fusion section. I have done some exploring and found out that PRIMA DOESN'T EVEN SHOW THE LOCATIONS OF NEARLY HALF THE ITEMS IN THE GAME!!! How disappointing.... Metroid Prime has a great walkthrough and the guide shows strategies on beating the toughest bosses, but not with Fusion! Come on Prima! I'm not trying to criticize you or anything, but I know you can work a little harder."
5,Beautiful Prayer Shawl,I had been waiting to receive this shawl and was not the least bit disappointed when I received it. It is beautifully done and I am proud to have it in my possession. I will be sharing with the intercessors I am training. Praise God.
5,Good stuff!,"I ordered this set of dvd's and a few days later showed up in great condition. Simple, easy, and swift service. Highly recommend."
5,Gospel Singing,"Cooling Water - featuring Lee Williams - is currently one of the greatest gospel works. The story behind the making of Cooling Water was great, especially since we were afforded some insight into Lee Williams. The gentleman can sing. In this video, he mixed some new and old sound. He truly uses his voice to heal and inspire. Cooling Water was both contemporary and old school. I thoroughly enjoy my video every time I play it. I ordered a copy for my daugher in MS. She will love it. The inclusion of Dottie P and the other featured singers were just the bomb! This made for a really great gospel video. Guys, pls make another soon."
5,A joy to listen to,"I love the Williams brothers; because they are anointed from God. Their rich voices make you want to cry. God has truly blessed them, and I can not wait to hear their next new Song. I purchased Cooling Water; because I have always loved the song, and wanted a copy. It is hard to find in stores, so I am happy I found it on line."
2,Tapestries-a retelling of Chinese Serial Drama!,"Tapestries: A Novel captures readers' interest at the beginning, with vivid descriptions of a tradional, pre-arranged wedding. However, the author get caught into unevolved, unnecessary details that are not historically accurated. The novel does not accuratedly portray Vietnam in any periods (though some details are revelant to the Vietnamese history). Reading this book reminds me of a Chinese soap and a drama series in which the rich oppresses the poor; son carries the burden of family and seeks revegence; sacrifies and unjusts portray upon female. There is no originality in thought and plots."
4,Great Holiday Gift,"Nguyen's eloquent prose and rich characters were captivating. As a fan of The Unwanted, the author's memoir, I had high expectations. Nguyen did not disappoint. In this novel, he weaves a tapestry of a country's history and culture combined with a beautiful, moving love story."
2,A tiring read,"I was disappointed with this book as it is full of lengthy description of landscapes, food, foliage, buildings et al. It was a chore to complete reading it and I found myself occasionally skipping parts of it. The storyline was OK and the entire tale could have been told much more succinctly. I read the first book by the same author and would highly recommend that. It was much more gripping."
1,expensive. tastes like rotten roses.,"I love tea. I have a cabinet with over 30 types of tea at any given time and we drink tea nearly every day in my home. This tea, a ""blooming"" white tea with rose petals needs only to be brewed a brief time. All white teas are best brewed briefly to retain their delicate taste. Having said that (so you know that I know how to properly brew this tea), this tea tastes like fermented/rotten roses. It is disgusting. Sweetener helps, but white teas should not require a lot of sweetening to be good. Try Davidson's rose tea varieties or Zhena's Gypsy Love rose tea, they are far better than this."
1,A Starting Point ONLY---NO MORE!,"Digby Smith's compilation was a big undertaking, and I have found it useful for the listings of actions and dates. However, there are so many errors existing in the listed orders of battle, including units that were not present, units that were not even in the field or theater of war, and so forth, that one cannot be sure what unit listings are correct and what are not. It is regretable that Mr Smith, as does almost every British writer, relies on faulty secondary works written by other British writers, rather than better sources authored by folks from outside the British isles. The complete absence of footnotes is a very serious weakness that cannot be overstated. For these numerous and considerable shortcomings, the book rates only 1 star."
4,"Monopoly, the computerized board game","User liked this game because ""everything was there."" I give it 4 out of 5 stars (instead of 5 stars) because it seemed not to be my age level (user is 16). The computer players are very good, I could only win at the most basic level. The graphics were a very good simulation of the board game."
1,faulty Monoply game,The product is faulty and I have contacted Beach Audio and they told me to contact Hasbro which I did and they have done nothing about it either. I am very upset.
4,great as an adult film icebreaker,"Okay, I know it is old and has a lot of hair but if you can get past that, it is great. I love this movie because anyone can watch it even if they are not in to adult entertainment.It is hillarious but at the same time extremely sexy.... I definitely recommend this one, even for the prudish..."
1,It's not Cinderella,"I just bought this because it's the ""companion"" to Cinderella. At least the actors are the same. That's where the simalarity ends. The only good thing about this flick was it was cheap. My advice, save your money & put it towards the overpriced Cinderella."
2,Amazon should let us know,"If a movie has been edited of all its good parts (nudity) it should not have a rating of R in the first place. Before you go there... I'm not counting bad language as a reason to give a movie an R rating. Even so, if Amazon knows or is told about this... they should demand a disclaimer from the producers on that the movie stating that the movie has been edited of original content and refund payment no questions asked when returned for this reason. That goes for all movies that are sold (for example:[[ASIN:B000VL7VEQ Killing Heat (1981)]this version is heavily edited but still has an R rating.) According to ""Mildenhell"", This version of Fairy Tales is an example of this happening and I for one, would like to know this information before I buy a movie."
1,nothing left,"83 minutes on my 1984 tape is now 76? What could they cut, nothing that racey to begin with. Look for an old tape."
4,not for your kids,this is a film I watched a long time ago when I was a teenager staying up late night on showtime. this is a b-movie in the fact that b-movies are low budget film with a sucky storyline bad acting and the only thing that makes it worth watching is plenty of nudity and sex and violence. we this one dosnt have the violence but does have the nudity and a little sex. so think of this movie as being a rauncy fairy tales. the people in it arent well know at least not to me. the only person of interest is the late angela aames. very pretty girl with a nice bod most would probaly know her from the old film bachler party she whas the girl at the beggenning of the film getting her son's picture taken. good scene even without the nudity. but anyway a good film if you a movie hound/ perv like myself. and if you want to c more of angela aames who died before her time. but you can also c her in the movie H.O.T.S good movie for people that like hot college girls playing football.
2,70's musical with lousy singing,"I guess I should have paid more attention to the date of production a little better. I can live with 1970s hairy bushes and saggy rear ends. When it is combined with a really lame story, increadibly bad singing, and ugly actors two stars is being kind. I was expecting it to be viginettes based on Fairy Tales, but with adult situations. It was one big romp, with the made up prince looking for someone to marry to produce an heir so he can inherit his kingdom. He finds a virgin sleeping beauty in a whorehouse that the Old women who lives in a shoe runs. If you are looking for a good adult themed movie, skip this one."
1,"Fairy Tales, no no no",Disappointing- unless you want slow slapstick that is more of a turn off than turn on.
4,Awesome,"I LOVE this CD. Her voice is too beautiful, and the duets are fantastic. I get tired of the fancy pants opera listeners from Amazon reviews criticizing minute details. Seriously, who are they ? In the end, her voice is like an angel & the effect is quite pleasant. Close your eyes and enjoy :}"
4,Heavenly,"Netrebko had the voice of an angle, sang like an angle and die as Violetta like a healthy soprano! Her voice had purity and power few can match, despite some lack of expressiveness in her lower register. As violetta she conveyed effectively strong passion. I hope to see as well as hear her in a DVD of the Saltzburg performance. If the Bonus DVD was an indication, this production should be unconventional and exciting.On the slightly negative side she seemed to pause (breath?) at strange places and glossed over some notes every now and then. Perhaps these were to be expected in a live performance.The CD was well produced with nice, clean sound. It was very good for a live recording. The singers and orchestra seemed to be at two different acoustical spaces.Highly recommended!"
1,"Villazon good, but Netrebko mis-cast","Traviata is my favourite Verdi opera and I have gathered at home quite a collection of cds and dvds with some of the greatest Violettas: Callas, Gheorghiu, Sutherland, Moffo, etc. I bought this item based on amazon reviews, but the fact of the matter is that I regret having bought it: I like the tenor and the baritone, but Netrebko did not convince me as Violetta. Her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET. Add a frustrating enunciation that would have Italians scream in horror and a phrasing that would get one booed at La Scala before the end of Libiamo...So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this item for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money."
1,Useless,Got this as a gift and find it hard to operate and clean. Will going back to store tomorrow.
5,This is a replacement bulb for the: Conair Round Illuminated Mirror,This is a replacement bulb for theConair Round Illuminated Mirror - Chrome
2,What a Turkey!,One of the most exciting live bands of the seventies BUT what a disappointing live offering. The playing is fine but the sound quality is poor and the CD is only part of their final performance at the Marquee with additional tracks which include a guitar solo and a drum solo. The trade mark twin guitars and use of slide guitar playing is here but the quality of sound really will put all but the most ardent fan off. To be fair the sleeve notes do explain the circumstances around the recording and that it is for the true fan.
3,"Great head, poor RC2 rapid connect system...","I had this ballhead for a few weeks. I thought the construction of the head was excellent. Superbly designed and crafted. Where it all falls apart for me is the Bogen RC2 rapid connect system. It just does not work well with heavy gear, and items twist. So, use the architectural plates you say? Great idea! I bought a bunch on to find that they do NOT work with many tele lens feet. Just not heavy duty enough rapid connect system for a ballhead of the caliber. If this head was available without the RC2, I think it would be a bargain if you could add an arca-swiss-type clamp to it."
3,Just for fun,"This album is clearly made just for fun, Helloween have even said so themself. The songs sounds like they are played by a garage band (talented garage band, but still..). In my opinion, the only great song is ""all my loving"", a Beatles cover. The Abba song ""Lay all your love on me"", is ok, but you would be better off listening to the Abba version. This record should only be bought by Helloween fans who needs it too complete their collection, since other people will be better of buying another album by helloween."
2,Fantastic Four The Thing Dress Up Set with Mask and Chest Plate,My son loved this in the store and I loved buying this for him. Being only four years old it was supposed to be a perfect size.I wanted to take the time to warn parents this toy is designed terribly. The straps are too short and the chest plate has reiforcements that cut into the childs chest area. I also has to cut the neck area larger so it did not choke my son. He is normal sized boy weighing only 42 pounds so keep this in mind. The recommended age on the box is 4 and over.
1,6-10 years old yeah right,"the strap-on chest barely fits my 5 year old and when i do put it on him it chokes him. i like the mask though it works just fine and goes great with the feet and the hands. Dont plan on getting any use out of the chest plate, because it is very small, tight fitting, and choking. The over all value isn't worth it, to only get use out of the mask."
3,Characters are not believable...,"The books foundation lies in the similarities and differences of the two main characters, Alex the General und Gus the Scientist. The other point to start from is the effort to make Mars a planet to live on. Both plots are being treated too black and white (the schism between Alex and Gus and how they are drifting more and more apart is not handled well) or solved with a deus-ex-machina solution. The plot itself could have been made into a complete trilogy (Step 1: Conquer Mars, Step 2: Build Mars, Step 3: Save Earth...) with enough emphasis on the different characters.On the positive side: I was captured by the principles of making Mars a habitable planet. This kind of situation suits well with Robert Forward, only his characters are not believable, and therefore not interesting enough to bring life into this book."
2,I'm a fan of Robert Forward. . .,". . .really I am -- but in this book, Forward concentrates almost exclusively on what is the weakest element of his writing -- character development -- and neglects the strongest element of his writing -- serious ""hard-science"" fiction.I've admitted in other reviews (see ""Saturn Rukh"") that I don't read Forward for character development or depth. Good thing too! The by-play between the twin brothers in this novel is unbelievable at best; the transformation from General to religious dictator is ridiculous; and the alien robots which suddenly turn up to save the day? Come on, guys!Dr. Forward -- PLEASE keep writing your ""hard science"". It's wonderful and thought-provoking in its own right. But forgive me for negative rating here. The downsides of ""Martian Rainbow"" far outweighed the upside."
4,Does the Job,"I like this Bible because it stands up to being tossed in a backpack or a cargo pocket well. That is the main selling point of this one for me--durability. I also really like the NLT for readability and ease of understanding.Only negatives are the print is a little small (but not overly so.) and flipping to passages is a little bit of a trick since the metal edges of the cover make it a little tougher to get your finger in next to the pages.The cover is cool, and is a conversation starter."
5,Blues Master,"We all know the Chuck Berry classics but this album contains some real gems and shows what a great blues singer Berry was. Actually, Chuck Berry in London was the first Chuck Berry album I ever bought, at the tender age of 14 - I only came to Johnny B Goode etc later."
4,By the author of 'Encyclopedia Brown' ...,"I bought this book mostly out of nostalgia - I remember reading it when I was younger. The mysteries are fairly easy, although one or two stumped me. A great book for amusement, or an older (11-13) child."
4,Fun in the pool!,"We bought this toy after returning 2 Rainbow Reef fish that stopped working after the first day. This Nemo is adorable and moves quickly in the water. The battery compartment is well-designed to prevent water from coming in. A very popular toy at the pool! It does use up batteries rather quickly, but we have rechargeables so it's no big deal..."
2,Nemo,It worked really great for the first few times then when it was time for new batteries it fizzled out after a half hour and had to be dried out to go again. Then it still only worked for a few minutes.
2,Swimming fish looks more like dead fish....,"I didnt like this toy at all. The fish cant even swimm right. It flowdes arround like a dead fish. I am glad that I didnt buy the fish, and that it was a gift. The fish itself looks adorable, but it just doesnt do nothing...."
5,one of petes best album,"coming out of my hometown oakland california this is one of petes best cds i heard i loved the songs on here it makes me feel like i,m there at the club live i seen him perform in front of oakland city hall a few years ago and he did a good show."
3,"Not challenging, good for when I don't feel well","I use a variety of yoga and pilates DVDs, this one is not my favorite but not my least favorite either. I think its probably best for beginners as it guides through breathing exercises. I found the actual poses easy to do and didn't work up a sweat. I do like her voice and the fact that she doesn't say a bunch of unnecessary things. This is a good practice for when I am under the weather or have overdone it the day before."
3,All Levels?,"This video is suppose to be for all levels - which includes beginner level (""viewer from Seattle"") last time I checked. However, I am a true beginner and I find her instruction is not adequate. The poses are challenging and if you have taken yoga before, the provided instruction may be fine. I don't find the modifications at the end of the video particularly useful. She doesn't talk you through the moves, and while some are basic and don't require verbal ques, I think for the more difficult poses it would be useful. I wouldn't recommend this video for any ""true"" beginners."
3,"Good, not great","I enjoyed this video and have already done the workout a few times. I was disappointed that Suzanne Deason did not give as many instructions when doing this routine as she has in the past and as Rodney Yee does. Several times while I am bent into a pretzel I can't quite figure out what I am supposed to do next without looking and if you look, you strain yourself. This video definitely has to be viewed a few times before doing the routine."
4,great for moving on from yoga for weight loss,"i really love this dvd. i first started yoga a year ago with suzanne's yoga for weight loss. since i have purchased many yoga dvd sessions. i find myself always returning to this one. it combines a great practice with relaxation. if you are looking to sweat like power yoga this won't work for you, but i find it does get my heart rate up at points while relaxing me at the same time."
3,Lot and lots of balancing with quick quick quick instruction,"""A Viewer"" was dead-on. I have some comments as well...I don't think I've ever felt as rushed as I did in this video. No sooner do you hit a pose and you're out and to the next.Two ways to view this: first, it's a library of poses you can learn and then do on your own time. Second, it's just too fast *if* you like to really sink into a pose which takes some time.If I were at Yoga boot camp and Ms. Deason was my drill, this is what I would imagine. A very soft, pleasent voice, telling me a new instruction every 3 seconds (literally). For this reason I found the video frustrating. Not a bad video, not much new-age vernacular, but just rushed.I've been doing Yoga for a few years and am probably late beginner, early intermediate."
2,Too fast to be beneficial,"Although I really liked the poses that were chosen, she went so fast I could barely find my way into each pose. In my opinion this negates the unique benefits of yoga, which include gradual stretch, sustained strength, and increased body awareness. How can you learn from the poses when you barely have time to greet them?There is one occassion that might call for this DVD: when you know you should get some exercise, but you really aren't feeling motivated. Because it goes by fast, it's easier to talk yourself into putting on this DVD instead of a more sustained practice.If you want a more thorough workout and are familiar with basic poses, I recomment Shiva Rea's Yoga Sanctuary. It is an audio CD but includes a poster with all the poses from the program."
1,Not recommended,"I would not recommend buying this product. I've installed it on two computers, one running XP and one Vista, and this program continually glitches and shuts down. I'll be working away and then it will freeze and I'll tell you, this is extremly frustrating. I'm never running any other programs and many times I'll simply be trying to open a saved file.I'm not sure why, but this program is seriously flawed! The full version does not have any of these problems, or at least as far as I know. Sibelius should be ashamed for selling such a worthless hunk of software!!!"
5,"hot chocolate, bailey's, whipped cream on a cold winter's night - perfect!","These are the perfect mugs for hot chocolate or coffee while you are sitting around a big-roaring fire with a group of friends after a day on a snow covered mountain! I purchased these mugs for a large gathering for our hot chocolate, bailey's and whipped cream drink because I wanted it to look nice, instead of the ordinary ceramic coffee-mug; this was exactly what I was looking for, a sturdy-bar-type mug with feet! I have used them several times already, getting so many rave compliments; can't wait until the holidays and cold weather so I can really use them - bring on the cocoa, coffee and your imagination!"
5,go go boots,My daughter absolutely loves these boots. All of her friends do as well. She wore them with a winter dress but all her friends and her put these on when playing. They think they are so cool.
5,hannah montana boots,"our 5 year old girl is having a hannah montana bday party, and this boots are the most amazing ones!!! they are just perfect!! very comfortable, and even at supermarket people stops us to comment about where did we get that awesome boots, true to size also.... i know whats to buy online ;D"
5,Great value!,"This was a text book for a class, and it was a LOT cheaper than if I had bought it at a bookstore. It arrived in good time and in good condition."
4,"Not for close/macros, good otherwise","This is the easiest fitting lens hood. All you have to do is snap it on to your lens by pressing the two buttons on them. No screws etc. to worry about. It does a nice job of protecting your lens & blocking sun. But when shooting very close to your subjects, it will cast a shadow. It ruined some of my tulip macros. I've now learnt to take them off when shooting close."
5,Should have come wih the lens in the first place,"Lens hoods really are a necessity when shooting outside. All the other Nikon DX lenses I have came with lens hoods. Why the 18-55mm did not is beyond me. However, it's a worthwhile purchase."
3,Simple but somewhat lacking in coverage,"I use this with the kit lens (18-55) and find that it is better than nothing, but somewhat lacking in shading ability. It is just not big enough."
5,Excellent Salt Grinder,"We own the matching pepper grinder from Peugeot and we love them both.This grinder is very easy to use and only requires one hand to operate, the grind is fine.Only downside (and it's my downside) is that it grinds so finely that I can't see how much I have ground, but I have poor eyesight.Really happy with this salt grinder, I wish we had bought it years ago."
4,Great Salt Grinder,"I wanted a salt grinder to replace the old salt shaker that just dumps out salt when you tip it over. The electric salt grinder is perfect. Now we can use sea salt and get the right amount, with just a touch of a button."
4,A Few Useful Tips,"I'd suggest borrowing this from your local library. It's a nicely packaged book with pastel pages, high quality photos and a sampling of hostess tips. The text probably equals 2 or 3 magazine articles, so I'd hate to pay $19 for it.It gives guidelines for preparing the guest room (add hangers to the closet, flowers on the bedside table, etc.) and a sampling of recipes for impressing your guests. They are lovely sounding (cranberry scones, strawberry iced tea, peanut butter s'mores)and the photos look good enough to eat. Note the Martha Stewart touches like the chocolate chip cookie photo showing a well-loved teddy bear with the cookies and milk.Along with these are some craft ideas like stamping your initial on your cocktail napkins or layering colored bath salts in a jar for the guest bath. It even includes a couple of pages with instructions for playing charades and twenty questions.All the ideas are pleasant enough, but overall it seems skimpy at 120 small sized pages."
4,Great Season.,"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that they split up the seasons instead of putting them all in one set. So, it takes about 4 or 5 dvd purchases to make up one season."
5,"Dear Daisy, Get Well Soon","The book Dear Daisy, Get Well Soon is a charming story. It is about Two close friends and neighbors named Daisy and Peter. Daisy gets ill with the chicken pox and cant not com out and play with him for about a week. To make her not so lonely and in hopes of helping her get better faster he sends diffrent thigns to her eachday. This book also is a counting book, and helps them learn the days of the week.For example on monday he sends her a get well card and sends it over ot her house by giving it to an elephant. There are also lots of wonderful drawings and visuals for them to see."
3,Interesting but Missing Mario Lanza,"This is an excellent introduction to some of the leading tenors of the last century. It is missing a number of fine tenors, however, and one in particular. The collection has no reference whatsoever to Mario Lanza. Unfortunately, this makes the collection interesting but incomplete because it lacks the opportunity to show comparabilty. I still recommend it for those who love grand voices. That being said, I recommend that anyone who listens to these masters also listen to Lanza and read about him and his splendid talents."
5,Sturdy Bag,"I purchased this bag to hold my ""Ultimate Support Music Stand"". It has a snug fit but not too tight. The bag is strong and has a convenient shoulder strap which makes it easy to transport to gigs."
2,a real downer,"In case you missed the last 100 movies out of Hollywood on racism in the south---here's another one. Although it does remind us of the sickness history has taught us about,especially around the period the movie is set in(circa 1949),it is too shocking brutal and unforgiving to offer any hope,let along enjoyment.Dennis Hopper's performance is fantastic!He is sadistic and paranoid and eventually pathetic.Hersey and Harris are excellent as they almost always are.The problem lies with the pattness of the movie.It's the familiar plot taken a little(or a lot)further for the shock value.I don't think I like this director and the screenplay might have been done by one of those slasher/gore types.The two stars are for the performances and that's about it."
4,Hopper does it again,"I must state that I am a avid fan of Dennis Hopper. Which probably explains my love of this film-it's a reprisal of my favorite Hopper-the menacing, frightfully sinister one-much like his role in ""Blue Velvet"" (the only saving grace that film, in my opinion). If you're not a big fan of his, then I, quite honestly, don't recommend ""Paris Trout."" Others might find it or 'too depressing' or even 'unsettling."" I tend to enjoy movies that that masses either find too odd or not uplifting enough. This is a movie about a man who doesn't adhere to societal mores in the deep south and how that affects those who are unfortunate enough to cross his path. If you're looking for a happy ending, then look elsewhere, because you won't find it here."
5,Great overview of Christian History,I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and not so detailed that it put you to sleep. Great Book!
3,An ok read,"I think to continue with a book that you find boring is just wasting you own time, this is initially how I rate my books, If I can finish the book in hand then it must have something in the story that kept my attention. This book had that something. Katherine Cheet is a cab driver by night and manages to handle 5 lovers by day but a chance meeting of a passenger brings it all crashing down on her. Quite an interesting, fairly fast paced."
3,hard to clean,"I got these cups for my 9 month old who does great with a sippy cup- but there is a little lip inside the spout that traps liquid- not only is it hard to clean, but when you have breastmilk in the cup, you want them to get every last drop, and that's not happening with these cups.Also the lids are HARD to get on, which on the one hand is great because she can't get it off, but bad because it's really hard for me to get on and off as well-- I've sloshed a lot just trying to get the top to seal.Overall, I think I'll put these away for when she's older to keep in the car."
3,"Spill proof, not leak proof.","Yes, these are cheap and handy, but don't count on them not leaking if your kids (like mine) drop them, knock them down, or toss them around. No, they don't ""spill"" when knocked over, but if you aren't right there when they get tipped over they might as well have spilled because by the time you get to it enough liquid will have leaked out that it might as might as well have spilled. For outside, or the zoo/park/beach/kitchen they are great. The rubber cover will keep the leaks in check in a bag for the most part. Best of all you can trash them and it's not going to make a huge dent in your wallet. We still use them, but for carpeted areas we stick to theMunchkin 12 Ounce Mighty Grip Toddler Sports Bottle, Colors May Varyand have been really impressed with the lack of leaks."
3,Not an everyday sippy cup,Agree that they worked great for the first few times than the lids started to come off/pop off. Also after a while the lid's holes got plugged up and couldn't be use any more. I guess they really are supposed to be tossed relatively soon.
2,The lids come off way to easy. Too many messes!!!!!!!!!!,"They worked great for the first few times than the lids started to come off and if your child drops it the lid pops right off. I would not recomend on a consent use, maybe a take and throw away right away."
5,Great Cup for learning and later,"I bought this cup several months ago for my now 11 month old son and it is awesome. I was able to find a pack that also had handles at Wal-mart which is really nice for learning but not necessary. This cup is light-weight, does not leak easily and while I have not yet lost one, I would not be stressed if I did because it is so cheap (BPA free too). He has been bottle/breast fed but just loves this cup and smiles when he sees it. I first bought him the born free sippy because that is the kind of bottle we used and that is a great sippy cup but is pricey at $11 each, difficult to clean as well as heavy and long for learners. I have tried the tilty cup which was great initially because he did not have to tip as far to get liquid out but now refuses the tilty now because he prefers the flow and sucking required for the take n toss; he will still use the born free happily. Anyways, great cup, I am about to get more as my pack does not have the plug for traveling."
2,Okay if you're only using as disposable cups,"I bought a bunch of these to keep in my car and my husband's car so we would always have sippy cups if we decided to go out to eat. The cups are very reasonably priced, so they are great for the ""take and toss' function, but they don't last. My son chews on the tip, and it instantly blocks up so he can't get any fluid out. When this happens, I have to through that one out and give him a new one. So, if you have a normal child who chews on his sippy cup, don't be surprised if he goes through these pretty quickly. If that's not a concern for you, these are an inexpensive option for cups."
3,"Great, right up until it's not.","I have tried many different sippy cups for my 9 month old. When I found the Take & Toss, I was pleasantly surprised that he took right to it easily. So easily, in fact, that he was using it all by himself while watching TV.He began chewing on the edge with his teeth and all-of-a-sudden- POP!- the lid came off and milk went everywhere. He was covered, terrified at the rush of cold milk all over him, and completely drenched.Oh well, back to the store I go...."
4,Sippy Cups,These are great but will need to be replaced after a while. My daughter chews on the lids and after a while they will start to leak...I would not describe them as spill proof either-you will still need to watch out for leaks etc-but they are a good product for the price.
5,A voice as smooth as velvet,"Cat Stevens has one of the best voices in the business. His range is incredible and his folk roots show through beautifully in ""Boy with the Moon and Stars on his Head."" ""Angelsea"" is another great track and can make me long for the days of yore. ""Can't keep it in"" shows his rockin side. Wonderful album for romantic times or any time. If you like this album, check out ""Tea for the Tillerman."" You won't be sorry."
5,Another great one,"Don't know if this is truly his last great album as is said below as I haven't listened to all the subsequent albums, but it's much better than Foreigner which came before and Buddha and the Chocolate Box which came after. I was at first slightly put off by his more scratchy voice on some tracks, but he sings them with such passion and intensity that I've grown to love them. The sound is a bit different from his two acknowledged classics, but this album is just as enjoyable. Highly recommended."
2,Zagat Hits the Skids,"Although the ratings are generated by questionaire entries, the writing is within the Zagats control. This book used to be witty and entertaining; now it seems as if a high-school English class was hired to do the writing. The ratings and addresses are useful, but what happened to the prose??? Boring."
5,HEAVY FIST THUMPING METAL TO AWAKEN EVERYONE,"This is buy far, a great album. There are a lot of powerful riffs on this CD, the last 3 or 4 songs just get better and better. Its definitely a MUST have for the motorheadbanger just getting started. The recording quality is not bad, either."
3,"Heavy As Usual, But Not Classic Motorhead","Savagely heavy metal, but the tunes aren't as good as I had hoped. A good filler album until the next one comes out."
1,Oh no!,"This album is not representative. It's Motorhead's weakest release up to date. It's just heavy and maybe Lemmy tried to show that he and his buddys are the heaviest, dirtiest and loudest on earth but they aren't. Only for true fans."
2,They seem to have lost their mojo,"I've been a subscriber to this newsletter since the late 90s. Traditionally, their recommendations have come out about 70/30 winning stocks. However, since the beginning of 2011, the losers have been outnumbering the winners substantially, and this is in a period when the Dow and the Nasdaq indices were up. Even with a few stellar performers, their overall performance in recommended buys has been fading. I will not be renewing my subscription."
1,Worse than worthless,I bought this publication. It touted a bank stock as one of the 2 best stocks one month to buy saying it didn't have any 'toxic' loans. I bought it. Turns out it had lots of bad real estate loans. Another bank finally took if over. Lost most of my money. So much for the research of high paid professionals.
5,Effective and economical,"At a fraction of the cost of branded cleaning products from machine manufacturers like Capresso, works just as well on my machine. Very happy."
1,Don't bother! Doesn't work!!,Did NOT work at all!!! So very disappointed. I bought this product to clean inside stainless steel milk frothing pitchers.
2,Try a different book first.,"This book has potential, but in general I am pretty dissatisfied.Good things:(1) It is pretty well thought-out.(2) The progression through 4 projects is good.(3) There is working code for the examples available online.Bad things:(1) The book is riddled with errors. If you include the unofficial errata from OReilly's Website, the book becomes about 200% more usable.(2) Why has this book not been reprinted? At LEAST OReilly should have released an official errata for this book at this point!!!(3) This book does NOT cover 10.3 and the XCode software (still uses project builder). In most cases this is ok and you can figure much of it out. However, there are times that the differences are too significant to overcome without a lot of effort.--I have been very happy with O'Reilly books in the past, but this one is substandard.I would recommend trying a different book unless this one is overhauled."
3,Very helpful with good examples but way too many errors,"I have found this book to be a very helpful guide to learning Cocoa. The examples are easy to dive into, and I have found that I get more and more from them as I return and review them for the third or fourth time.Unfortunately, Building Cocoa Applications is also riddled with errors. Make sure you get a copy of the unconfirmed errors from O'Reilly's web site. As you dig into this book, these comments and corrections are invaluable."
2,Error-ridden and too little actual teaching,"Not recommended, although some people like it a lot. More errors in the text than others, making you go to the web for errata pages. Relies too much on just presenting source code for the reader to type in, without adequate explanation of what the code does and why it's structured the way it is. Less of a gentle introduction than Hillegass's book ""Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X"", less comprehensive than Anguish's book ""Cocoa Programming""."
3,XCode,Hits some points that I needed cleared up but not all of them. Handy for reference which could probably be gotten off of the internet.
2,Content OK; Needs Editing,"This book's content is all right. The authors have a writing style that keeps you moving along. Unfortunately, the numerous editing errors (both in the text and in the code) keep tripping you up.I gave up after finding many, many errors, both of simple grammar/punctuation/spelling, and of the more serious coding sort, in the first five chapters. So many of the things they tell you are just wrong. Examples contradict what is written in the previous paragraph. Sometimes it appears as though someone's search-and-replace went wild and the wrong word appears repeatedly in a paragraph. And on and on.This is another disappointing Cocoa book from O'Reilly. I hope they will stop rushing things and make sure the next one is done right."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Essays compiled by editors Andrew Hurrell and Ngaire Woods examine globalization's current inequalities and prospects for future justice and injustice. Each selection looks at a different aspect of these issues, with contributors primarily reviewing history, analyzing each topic, and avoiding hard prescriptions. Where they do offer proposals, the ideas are carefully reasoned, modest, and practical. Many chapters' concepts overlap, emphasizing the interconnections among these issues. The writing varies from straightforward to academic, but the book is readable, avoids jargon, and argues clearly. Copious endnotes help the reader find more information. We [...] recommend this book to those interested in international economic and trade policy, economic and social justice, international policies, and the new global economy's changing power structures."
3,"No, you Will Want Higher Quality...","Looks cute, cheap, good deal, not so much. For gorilla and toy fans, save your money for something with a bit more quality. It's not bad, but it's small, gray, and feels kind of chalky. I'd say pass, but not too bad in itself..."
3,Wahl Total Body Groomer,"This product is a good product. I would not rate it higher than that. I expected a lot more from this product. I would recommend it to a friend, but I would also say that a good set of regular barber clippers would do the same job."
3,oddly fascinating,"I'm not sure if Adam Green is deliberately trying to sound one part folksy-druggy kooky balladeer and one part vaudevillian-cum-cabaret singer. Either way, it matters little. I'm completely intrigued.Oh, I'm not saying I love his music, but I certainly appreciate the gusty chutzpah to put something out there like ""Gemstones"". The lyrics are strange and somewhat disturbing and the music is stripped down and, yes, simple. But it's Adam's voice, his character that really kept me listening track after track.Actually, I take that back, I am saying I like his music and I'm totally going to endorse this cd! And don't let the haters keep you from enjoying something completely left of center.The songs are short (around 2 minutes each), so it wasn't a huge time investment. It didn't change my life, but it didn't rob me of 30 minutes of my life, which I can assure you happens every time I happen to flick on American Idol."
2,tired melodies,"""friends of mine"" was so unique, every song a gem. now adam green sounds a bit like an old lounge act anchored by tired melodies that disappoint. one of the great things about ""friends of mine"" was the haunting string section that backed greens vocals at every turn; making his absurd lyrics appear ironic and sarcastic. i think green needs that counter-weight, that sincere music that compliments his quirky vocals and absurd lyrics. as a big fan of adams, i admire his change in direction, but something was lost on the way...no gemstones here. BUNNYRANCH!!!"
4,comfortable option,"My feet width I'd say is medium and they fit snug and perfect in these. I wouldn't recommend for wide feet. I wore my pair to the ground as these were very comfortable to wear all day and even if not ""meant"" to be, I also would use for working out and going to the gym."
2,description not accurate,"The shoe itself is a good product, but it says white/beige and there is no white on the shoe. Very deceptive."
5,Love them! Very comfortable,I love these shoes! They are very comfortable and go great with my jeans and sweatpants. They need to fit perfectly because their is no shoelace to tie so make sure you get your correct size (I am usually a 7.5 - 8 so I chose the 7.5 and they fit fine).
5,Excellent Pair of Shoes! (cute too),"I wanted something different in a pair of shoes, so I ordered these fun orange colored shoes. THEY are awesome! One of the best pairs of shoes I have ever owned. They fit nice, it is weird the first time you put them on because there is no tongue or laces on the shoe. Take a little to get used to. BUT they are really comfortable. Great buy!"
4,Great shoes !,"I may get the 4th pair soon. I also found the same model, in different colors at SEARS on sale for $39.99 plus tax. I gave 4 stars because they are not as cushy."
2,Comfy but so so color looks different in Pic,Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige. Which leads you to think the color is mostly white. The true color is neither! There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes. I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes. No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all. The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain. The materials are an excellent quality. If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes.
5,"Not a chart-buster, but a keeper nonetheless","With Ringo Starr and Jeff Lynne on hand, and a melodic number to work on, Sir Paul McCartney has delivered a most entertaining CD single.Supporting tracks are also creative, in the ""Beatles"" frame of reference.This was a fine follow-up to the ""new"" Beatles' singles of 1995-1996, Jeff Lynne in the booth.Yes, there's some of the Beatles here, some of Wings...alot of Sir Paul.It's interesting to reflect that the ""Run, Devil, Run"" CD was right around the corner - we were suddenly back in the Cavern - back to his roots. But in the same musical ""world""."
4,Straight Answers to Tough Questions,A comprehensive and understandable treatment of a very complex subject
1,judgemental and discouraging,"Looking for information and reassurance? - thenI would discourage you from getting this book.There were several quite harsh and judgmental passages- contributing to the feeling that this process islike an inquisition. Witnesses? I don't get it. Whohas ""witnesses"" to a painful misbegotten past - apersonal past, 10,20,30 years ago? ""Forms and inquiries"".This book only helps reinforce the stereotype that menwho were never married can have no compassion."
4,An awesome hour alone with two naked guys,"This video was great! It was so much fun spending this hour with these two naked guys, doing something that I've never seen anywhere else; one giving the other a full body naked fur trim!!I know this is a fantasy most guys have never had the chance to live out. The barber seems to be a a real barber, he's got the tools and he's got the technique. No where else have I had the chance to see a video like this where so much time was devoted to the fantasy.Also, what a relief to have a video where two guys are naked, and there is no porn activity, AND the nudity is something natural that two guys would do together - whether it is two lovers tending to each other, or the other fantasy of going to the barber and getting a full body naked trim!I want more of this!!"
3,"Could have been PERFECT, but it's still quite good.","I was really looking forward to getting this DVD, it's a fantasy of mine for a long time. The guys are really good - not twinks, mature nicely built and in good shape. The video does what it promises - a haircut, shave in the nude (both people). However, there are a few things that were disappointing to me (personal taste):1. Guy getting the shave has a PA. I find those disgusting.2. The pubic region is not shaved, just trimmed with a scissor. Would have liked a full shave there too.3. Shaving cream/manual razor would be hot too, but it's ok as is.4. Legs not touched.Anyway if this is your fantasy too, I recommend it."
2,Warning - this is mostly for children,"This should really be stated in the buying info, I'll do it here: It contains of 32 pages, 11 of these are text, with an average of 5 lines per page with a large font, that is an average of 3 sentences of what most adult would know from common knowledge. Not much new about the snow leopard, that you didn't already knew. But the 13 photos + the cover photos are magnificient, though they are mostly from zoological gardens."
4,How can you live without a film reference guide?,"I have since subscribed to the 2006 edition, and plan on purchasing the 2007. Please be aware that though dvd releases and film festivals are updated, there are no new reviews during the calendar year. I recommend MetaCritic or RottenTomatoes for staying current.I sometimes disagree with his opinions, and wish that the capsule summaries were longer, but I think this is a great tool. The searchability is a little clunky, but a useful tool (""I'm pretty sure it was a French comedy, maybe late 80's..."")"
3,mythology,"I love Lord Dunsany, his books are pretty brilliant - especially The Blessing of Pan. This book and that one are brilliant!"
1,Gen Lee - Civil war,"General Lee was a trator to this country and his training, and he would have replaced the Black-American slaves with the Irish serfs of Europe, according to Elizabeth B. Pryor, in her study of Lee, in Reading The Man. Please only recommend historal facts to me, and not some idealized opinion. Lee was a West Point trained soldier, and he selected personal comfort and convience over duty. Am I to believe that Ms. Pryor is incorrect?"
2,"Mapplethorpe's Flowers ""Pocket Guide""","Ordered this ""book"", and when it came in, realized I had not read the small print, this ""book"" is 4"" x 4"". Did one of the reviewers call this a coffee table book??? Superb images, just make sure you leave the magnifying glass nearby..."
2,Erin from the Air,"Barely acceptable addition to this series with a distorted sense of geography. Several highlights ignored. Some pretty pictures, however. Select instead ""Over Ireland"" which is a five-star tour with excellent music and narration."
5,The Old Sod,"The beauty of Ireland, makes me want to return to see parts that i had not seen on previous trips."
3,Decent,"House of Clocks is typical Fulci past his prime. While interesting enough to get diehards like me to buy it, the film really isn't anything special. It has some nice gore effects, but overall House of Clocks is a rather pedestrian affair. You won't be missing anything if you skip this, but it isn't bad if you do. Maybe a few more dead bodies would have me rate this higher. Thanks to the advent of DVD and the insuing resurgence of interest in Italian horror, I'm thankful we can even see this at all."
5,An album of mythic proportions,"I first encountered Johnny Clegg in 1988 via Jimmy Buffet's album, ""Hot Water"" in which he covers a Clegg tune ""Great Heart."" I immediately bought the first Clegg album I could find, Shadow man, and it was the single best musical purchase I've ever made. The music is intoxicating, the rhythms are addictive, and the depth and breadth of emotion is startling. He speaks of things that most Americans take for granted such as freedom, human rights, and oppression. But his views on all things are both sublime and poetic. This album not only shocked me in its musical quality and originality, it moved my soul (and feet!) How some people can go through life without knowing Johnny Clegg is a mystery to me. Buy it now, enjoy it forever."
5,A great book to help with the broken heart.,"I read a poem one day that really touched me, tracked it down, and found it was from this book. It's an amazing set that you can relate to. I highly recommend."
1,KR,"I love the songs on this disc. However, it is not really compatible with the PS3. So sometimes, one of the two microphones do not work and shut off. When you reboot the PS3, it still doesn't work. So be wary of this."
4,Karaoke Revolution Party for PS2,A fun game with a great array of songs that's fun for the whole family.
4,Fun game for a group,"I bought this game for my fiance's 9yr old. We all had fun playing the competitive games; the karaoke wasn't that fun. The people who ended up liking the game the most were myself and my fiance's 12yr old. The 9yr old really liked creating the characters. The variety of songs was good. In addition to buying the game I bought an extra mic, but after a couple days one of the mics stopped working."
5,Wonderful canner,I have had this for a couple of months and I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with it. I did use pint jars and it did everything promised for a reasonable price.
3,Good Price,Pretty much what I expected. The rack is a little difficult to work with unless using large jars. No problem using it on my ceramic cooktop.
4,"Great Product, Only Holds Quart Jars","This works perfectly at a good price. I am unable to process anything other than quart jars in the rack provided. Technically I could try to use pint and half pint jars, but they do not rest properly and end up falling over or even through the rack when it is in the lifted (hanging by handles to rim of pot) position."
1,Do Not Buy!,"After only a week of canning with this water bath canner, it developed a hole which not only ruined the pot, but also from all the water leaked from it, ruined my electric stove top. I called the company and they did send me a replacement (which also developed a hole in under a month), but refused to replace or repair my electric stove. Stay away from this product and company. I've now owned 2 of these water bath canners and they both were ruined within 1 month of summer canning. What a waste of money!"
1,This item is dangerous to use,One month into owning it and the bottom is peeling. Do not purchase this product. It is not safe to use. Spend your money on something else.
2,Not good for quart jars,"This canner is fine for small jars of preserves, but it is too short for quart jars. We could not keep the recommended level of boiling water above the jars. We had a terrible mess in our kitchen, and had to keep the mop handy during the processing time. We also had to keep adding water to replace all the water that boiled out. We will never use this again for anything bigger than pint jars."
2,"Pot's OK, rack not so great","By the second time I used this, the rack was completely ORANGE with rust. Thank you china."
5,"Great piece of equipment, great price","I debated purchasing a canner until I tried using one of my stockpots. What a pain. I don't think there's a stockpot out there that can hold more than three or four quart jars -- unless you get a gigantic restaurant-sized one that costs an arm and a leg.That said, this is NOT a stockpot, so don't expect to make batches of soup (though you could get away with it, I suppose). This is for water baths for canning. It is just thick enough to not warp, but if you DO cook somthing in this, you should expect to pay a lot of attention to the food so it doesn't scorch on the bottom. This is a quality product for its intended purpose and was worth every penny I spent (around $20). In fact, it's actually worth every penny of its retail price. It'll last for years."
4,Great canning pot.,Great pot for canning. Rack is so helpful when putting jars in and pulling them out of boiling water. My rack looks like it's plastic coating is getting wrinkled. Hoping it doesn't peel off and get rusty.
2,"granite ware pot great, rack not","The granite ware pot that I purchased is great. The rack is very questionable. After one batch of canning the coating on the rack is all bubbled up and peeling off, Not sure if it is safe to use again, not sure what chemical is spayed on it. I tried to email seller but it is the only item I have purchased from amazon that there is no options to leave feedback for seller. Not sure how to return one piece of a product. The pot is a great size."
1,Service Stinks,True Value sent us a defective product. I called and they said that they would send us a replacement immediately and to send the defective product. We sent the defective product back a month ago and have not gotten a repacement product. I will not buy anything else from Amazon if True Value is the supplier.
4,"Nice, big, cheap","Totally does what it's meant to do! I'm happy I was able to snag this, with the rack for a low price. After 1 use it seems the rack is starting to feel rusty--- but I think it will hold up. Just note that I don't think this pot is safe for cooking chili, etc. Just use for waterbath canning. Fun!"
4,Good Canning Pot,"This is a really good canning pot and it's very large. The only problem I did have with it was that it was so large, as a result of it's size it took a long time for water to heat up. However, once the water was boiling I could fit about 9 jars in the pot."
2,"It is great, but has a place where it has either been repaired or is going to give out....","The pot is great, but has a repaired hole in it. Any minute I can expect a kitchen full of water.....I do not have the box so I can not send it back. Other than that It is great. The people who check the products are not."
5,boiling water bath canner,deep enough to cover 7 quart jars when canning. good price on a good product.
1,Rack inside pot rusts quickly,Avoid low price such as this. The rack inside the pot corroded within the first week. I now use clean towels in the bottom of pot to keep jars from breaking. The heavy duty bright green carrier by Ball Canning is good but doesn't fit but 5 small jars at a time.
5,It worked great,"This is just like the one I used years ago, worked perfectly and will continue to do so in the future..."
4,Can at home,The canner is great and light weight and the shelf helps a lot. The shipping was considerably longer than it was quoted.
5,jellys,My wife made 65 quarts with this canner and it met all her expectations. Hopefully it is American made because it seemed very strong and durable and will last quite a few years.
4,Needed for canning,Quart CannerWe already a pint canner but needed to can our garden cucumbers in larger jars. This product worked very well.Quart Canner
2,Not so good canner,The canner rack was so flimsy that it actually bent when the canning jars were being put onto the rack. The hooks for holding the rack up on the side kept giving way and allowing the jars to fall into the water before the rack was filled
2,Concave Bottom,"Mine dented when weight was applied. Contacted customer service (not Amazon) and they've never responded.You need to know that the bottom of this water-bath-canner is very concave which is only recommended for gas stoves. The National Center for Home Food Preservation recommends only flat bottomed canners for use on electric or flat-top stoves. I will not be able to use this canner now because of this.At first use, the shiny coat came off of the bottle rack. It left a terrible dust coat over all of my bottles."
4,Covered Canner With Rack,"Good Product, arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Used it for my first ever canning experience. It worked great. I found that the rack will not hold pint/half pint jars without them slipping through. Will have to purchase a different rack if canning in smaller jars."
1,Lasted 2 years...dissappointed,"Loved this canner at first. I bought it because it was slightly taller than my older one so it didn't boil over when I was processing quart jars. I can quite a bit but I expected the life of the pot to be longer than 2 years. Just this evening I filled it up and there was a small hole in the bottom edge...it leaks and is totally worthless. I have seen this happen in much older pots but not one that was this new. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Also, had to purchase a stainless steel rack after a month as the one included had rusted."
4,Good for the price,"As noted in other reviews, the spacing on the bars of the canning rack could be a bit closer. It's fine for larger jars, but causes smaller jelly jars to tip if they aren't balanced correctly between the bars. I'm going to try to make some sort of small adjustment to the rack to provide support for smaller jars since I do a lot of jelly jar size canning. Other than that, I'm happy with what I got for the price I paid."
4,Badly needs another guitarist,"Overall, this is a good live album. Unfortunately, as good as Wolf Hoffmann is, this album just doesn't sound right with only 1 guitarist since most of these songs were written for 2 guitarists. The best examples of this are ""Breaker"" & ""Restless & Wild,"" which don't sound nearly as good as the versions from their older live album ""Staying A Life."" This wasn't a problem for their 90s studio albums because they overdubbed, but they couldn't replicate the sound live."
4,Where is this guy??,This is a great album start to finish..I'm amazed he hasn't put out anything new since 2006...Where the hell is he?? Does anybody know??
3,Tomy Star Planetarium,It is OK but it show black dots on the ceiling for the stars which was a little disappointing.
1,Didn't work very well,"Display on ceiling and walls didn't work very well. If you don't have bare walls free from pictures, it doesn't work well."
2,"An OK action movie,pathetic DVD transfer!","This movie is OK action movie. It deals with a FBI agent or some government agent trying to stop a government coup.Jack Scalia plays the agent who is enjoying a social function when it's taken over by miltary terrorists. Of course Jack Scalia saves the day, gets the girl and saves the day/world!This DVD is rated R for violence,murder,death ,partial nudity and swearing. The DVD transfer is pathetic.The only extras are a trailer, a actor bio and a very bad scene selection!!buy this movie if you are fans of Jack Scalia(a B grade actor who was big in the past) ,or if you love B grade action movies or just a pathetic DVD transfer!!my advice rent it .But this DVD may be hard to rent and or buy!! So if you want this movie, buy it online here at Amazon!!"
3,Powerless,"Now don't get me wrong I love my boy D-Haddy but he definitely compromised his gift on this one. I have listened to this CD over and over again and I can't find one ""thank you Jesus"", ""Hallelujah"", bible verse or anything in it. To be honest if I didn't know it was gospel I would think I was listening to a regular R&B love album. He has a lot of ""he"" and ""him"" on the album instead of the name that's above all names, the almighty JESUS! Deitrick seemed to have taken a step backwards in his ministry and a step forward in the direction of trying to sell records. This CD is a disappointment to say the least, but his past CD's are so good I am willing to let this one slide. The production is outstanding but that's not enough when you are trying to edify the body of Christ. In other words, ""7 Days"" is 1 hour of Deitrick and his talent, with maybe 2 minutes of Christ."
5,The BOMB!!!!,"I love this CD. I find myself singing "" You gotta sit back and count your blessings, you gotta name them one by one ! Oh yea, I am feeling this CD. It doesn't mention the name of Jesus much but the message is there. Positive, Encouraging, Uplifting lyrics. Every song has a good message."
2,Do you really want to sing Gospel?,"I have all of Deitrick Haddon's CD's and honestly the one I like the most is Lost and Found. I'm not an old school traditional gospel loving person. I like contemporary, traditional and all that. I dont' pigeon hold gospel artists to a specific genre because God can and will be praised through whatever sound is sweet to him, HOWEVER with this CD I just felt like Deitrick really wanted to be an R&B singer. There comes a point where enough is enough and I didn't feel any anointing in this and nothing moved me about it. I like Deitrick as an artist but this CD just wasn't it for me."
2,Change is a bit much...,"I absolutely agree with the reviewers who gave this album a low rating, mainly because Deitrick's sound was put in the hands of R&B producers, therefore churning out music that just doesn't fit. I miss the ""Crossroads,"" and ""Lost and Found"" Deitrick. What this album is, is Bobby Valentino's album. I invite anyone to listen to both and tell me I'm wrong. Thanks, Tim & Bob. At least J. Moss can produce a gospel track and an R&B track, and we're able to tell the difference--and not by just SOUND either. I still loooove Deitrick Haddon, but this album was a slight letdown."
5,Go Head Mr. Haddon! - Awesome,"I love this CD. You have done it again. Keep up the good work. You always put God first. I especially like Don't Go. It's so true. You go your own way and then realize you need to come home. I've been there and so many will be able to relate to this CD.Dawne,Jacksonville, FL"
2,I guess....,"I found this album to be a bit pretentious. Most of it is overly secular and a touch obvious. The artist seems too involved with himself from the cover to the tracks. Heaven Knows,on the other hand, is a strong seletion which speaks to the moral compass in everyone saint or sinner. I actually bought this cd because of it, unfortunately I was sorely disappointed in the lack of originality or depth of spirituality in the music. When you can't feel it ...why bother."
3,Not His Best,"I've always been attracted to Dhaddy's powerful voice and uncompromising praise and worship style. However, in this album it's almost like he tries his best not to say the name Jesus. Was this a record label decision? I thought the whole purpose for leading people to Christ was done my lifting up Jesus. How are we going to attract people to Christ, when we don't even say his name.He's still my favorite singer."
5,I'm grateful she's back!,"Jackie Kramer is a talented author who's been missing from the romance scene too long. WARRIOR'S HEART is a wonderful book -- its Oklahoma setting made me feel like I was home again. I loved the story, the characters (especially the kid!), and recommend this book to everyone!"
3,Check your pack before ordering this,"I have no problem with the item itself, yet I bought this to go for my Nikkor 55-200 VR, and found out that there is already a one for free in the pack. So, check what's in your pack before ordering."
1,WORST Audio I Have EVER Heard !!,"Don't waste your time! The audio is muffled - at best. Even the interviews are of poor audio quality. I've seen ELO live, twice, and they are far, far better than this cheesey DVD. Fortunately, they are on tour again (Fall 2001) - so perhaps a good DVD production is just around the corner. The other reviews contained in this section appear to be biased. Save your money - you do not want to own this DVD."
1,Weak,"This video can be best described as an amateurish attempt at telling the story of the greatest band of all time, ELO. There's nothing new here - most of the information and still photos within come from Bev Bevan's book, ""The Electric Light Orchestra Story"". Meanwhile, the patient ELO fan is STILL waiting for the definitive ELO video that's complete with interviews with Jeff and the elusive MTV videos of the past."
5,One of the Greatest Movies,"When I was growing up I used to watch this movie with my grandma.. Have been looking for this movie for awhile and finally found it on DVD and ""NEW"".. One of the best movies of Elvis.. A must watch.."
3,ENJOYABLE,"ELVIS SHOWS WHAT A TALENTED ACTOR HE IS.BARBARA SYANWYCK IS POLISHED AND LEIF ERICKSON SOLID .WITH A DECENT SUPPORTING CAST, A GOOD STORY IS TURNED INTO A PLEASING MOVIE. HERE ,ELVIS IS A SINGER WITH A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER AND PRONE TO TROUBLE.HE JOINS A CARNIVAL AND FINALLY LEARNS THE MEANING OF HARD WORK AND TRUE LOVE.ELVIS SINGS HIS HIT 'LITTLE EGYPT' AND ALSO 'POISON IVY LEAGUE'.MOST ENJOYABLE. AHMED YACOOB."
2,More of Paramount's shoddy dvd products,"As far as I can discern, the only reason anyone would buy ""Roustabout"" or ""Easy Come Easy Go"", etc. is to see Elvis perform the admittedly weak songs.In lieu of anything else in the films, singing is all there is to enjoy; I'd hazard to guess 99.99% of viewers aren't expecting an engrossing story.So how does Paramount treat the folks who would buy these musicals? Pretty poorly. There's zero extras (some of their Presley releases don't even include the trailers) and, worst of all, many of them don't even have chapter access to the SONGS. Like this one. You read right.Hard to believe, isn't it? Paramount is continuing their reign as worst major studio dvd publisher..."
1,roustabout,this dvd would not play. It would come up on screen that it would not play in my area. It had AL on front of the dvd which I guess it was not supposed to play in alabama.If it would not play in alabama then it should not be shipped to alabama.
3,Presley and Stanwyck!,"""Roustabout"" (1964) is a better-than-average Elvis Presley musical with the added bonus of Barbara Stanwyck in one of her last films. It's nice to see Elvis play an unsympathetic character for a change. Despite the upbeat ending, he's still a jerk and it's great when Stanwyck yells at him. The soundtrack is mostly forgettable but it includes one classic song, ""Little Egypt."" As always, there are a few Elvis fight scenes to keep things lively. Overall, ""Roustabout"" represents the last decent Presley vehicle before the downhill journey into schlock."
3,The Carnival,Elvis is the bad boy turned good. He clearly irritates others by his behavior on the road. That is until gets sucked into the life of a carnival. The language lesson on terms used in the carnival makes an interesting background. His presence as a performer turns the fortune of the carnival around. What comes through is that carnivals are fun.
2,Least favorite,"recently started to collect Elvis movies and of the ones I have so far this is the one I like the least. Best so far are Kid Galahad, King Creole, Jailhouse Rock and Wild in the Country being my favorite."
5,I love criminal minds)),The best series ever) Shemar Moore yum! Love the price and love the cast of criminal minds greatest show ever
5,No scratched discs here.,"It goes without saying that this show is excellent. If you're viewing this product I will assume that you already know this. There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this television show. However, this review is for the physical boxed set, not the show itself. Be sure to checkout Wikipedia for a brief synopsis of the show if you were sent here by a friend or relative to buy a gift ([...]).One member reported not receiving this product. I received mine the very next day; thank you Prime. Another member commented that his/her discs arrived in a condition which rendered them useless. This is certainly not the case for me. Nevertheless, the boxed set arrived well packaged and in excellent condition (no bent corners, etc.). I purchased this as a gift for the girlfriend and she could not be happier! We're both enjoying an episode...or four, every night."
2,Problem with Season 5 box,"The review is specifically about this product, not the series.Season 5 comes in a different package than the rest of the six. I exchanged the product and got the same thing again. Season 5 comes in a standard DVD case while all the others have a nice shiny package that holds 3-4 slim DVD cases."
5,I love the show but hate my dvd player,I was watching the show on my laptop for the first 3 seasons then the dvd player is freezing up so I have to switch to using my ps3. I love the characters of criminal minds expecualy dr spencer reid he is a cutie. I am watching them all in order because I did watch the first season when it was on tv then life happends and I missed a lot. I saw reruns of most episodes on diffrent networks and not in order. I haven't seen most of the episodes in season 5 and 6 and the begining of season 7 can't wait for that season to come out so I can buy it too.
4,Got a great deal on it!,I got such a great deal on this set! I love this show and I'm glad I didn't have to spend that much on it . :)
1,this pretty much sucks,I was really excited when I ordered this. Finished the first season with a couple of cd's having scratches but since they still played I let it go. Now I am on season 2 and the amount of scratches on the cd's are so bad some of the shows won't even play. I'm going to have to return it and hope they can send a good copy back to me.
3,Disappointed,All seasons except 5 came as a boxed set. I don't know if that was just how they were boxed for that particular season but that wasn't what we expected...
4,Great show!,What a terrific ensemble and as much as I hate to say it - because of its violent nature - there are some very creative plots.
5,criminal minds,"Love this series, the cast is awesome, and the stories are very interesting, they really draw you in as a viewer."
5,awesome purchase,Love this show! Wish I could get the rest of the seasons for this low of a price. Criminal Minds rocks!
3,The Z Team,"If you can't hire the A Team call in the Z Team aka Special Forces. This film couldn't even afford real helicopters and we are treated to some strange looking CGI replacments. Aside from that it does show some half decent fight scenes, however the awefull sound effects and over use of swooshing sounds spoil it all."
1,do not use wirefly for motorola,"Still waiting 20 days later for a phone. We keep hearing 48 to 72 hours later. I am sad. My husband is so frustrated that today he will go pay big money for the phone at a Nextel dealer. They claim to have zero motorola phones, but the Amazon tag says ""in stock"".Customer service is not helpful. We keep having to call them for updates."
3,Great Movie! DVD lacking features..,"This is a great DVD. The movie is awesome and hilarious! My only issue is that there really just weren't enough bonus features on the DVD. I mean, to me, that is the whole point of getting something on DVD. I love to watch bonus features and commentaries; and sadly, this DVD is lacking in that department. If you are only interested in the movie itself, then I would definitely recommend this DVD!"
3,"Flying body parts, perversity, loyalty & trust...it has got it all","Watching this made me feel creepy but it was hilarious in parts, embarrassing in others. There's a young girl who thought she saw her father killed when it was launched in a rocket ship. She dedicates her life to the study of the skies. But then her father comes back -- years have past and he has the most outrageous story to tell. It's a film that can't be described -- you'll not be neutral about it but whether you'll like it, love it, or hate it will depend on just how high your tolerance for the weird is. I gave it a 3 because I haven't really figured out how I felt about it."
4,short stories of pirates,"This book features an enjoyable group of short stories about pirates, from different countries. No blood and guts here, although one tale from Africa is a little spooky. The stories can be read aloud, or read by elementary scholl readers. The softcover version of this is very nice, with a strong glossy cover with endflaps like a hardcover. The endflaps are to be used as bookmarks. Nice colorful painted illustrations on every page."
3,"good stories, lame illustrations","The stories in this book are good. Interesting without being too scary. However, the illustrations are supremely dull. They don't really show what's happening in the story. I'm quite disappointed with them but the stories are good. My son enjoys them despite the boring pictures."
3,Appropriate but bland,"As children's books rely on both word and image, this book falls short in captivating a child's interest visually. While the text is written in an appropriate format, the presentation is, in a word, bland. The cover does not represent the illustration content of the book. While the cover is in color and mildy interesting, the remainder of the illustrations are pen and ink drawings that weaken its presentation, especially when sharing with younger children."
2,Not too impressive...,"I was hoping for a really good read aloud Torah book for my two children, both under the age of six. However, the book is extremely basic and ""babyish"" in the words of my older daughter. The pictures, (while they do make me somewhat nostalgic for the seventies) do not draw the kids in to the stories at all, although my kids may be more into fancy artwork than some...The writing does make it easier for ME to understand the Torah stories, but are not intriguing to my kids. Overall, I wished that there had been a store in which I could peruse a couple of books on the Torah for children, because I doubt that I would have bought this one. I'll be buying another one soon."
5,Excellent - depth in simplicity,"I love reading this book to my kids at night. The narrations are accessibly simple - very few sentences are more than one line long - and yet retain the depth and layered meaning of the original stories. The questions are thought-provoking for adults as well as children. I wish the author would write volumes II, III, etc."
5,Excellent book!,"I bought this book for my grandson, but I enjoy and love the book! It is an excellent book and penned so greatly. It has ""hearing questions"" and ""imagining questions"" at the end of each section so that it is more than just a collection of children's Bible stories; it also makes you think about the deeper meaning of the Bible accounts. The illustrations are precious too. I recommend this little book for all who love the Torah, whether Jewish, Messianic Jewish, Messianic Gentile, or Christian, and want to share Torah with their children."
4,Poor Printing,I was disappointed in the quality of the printing of the first few pages of this book. It is not a copy I would have picked up in a store; I would have looked for a better copy (I did get this new from Amazon).
1,A Complete Waste of Money!!!,"This miserable little video is merely raw footage from a trade show in Las Vegas. It's nothing. Practically no nudity, really nothing sexy at all. The prodocers of this video should be ashamed of themselves. I completely wasted my money on this one."
2,Misleading DVD,This DVD is VERY misleading and this isn't traditional spanking scenes like I thought at first. I did purchase this DVD thinking it was agreat buy since I only paid three dollars plus shipping and handling. I also thought I would be seeing spanking scenes with bratty girls getting their comeuppance. The one I had purchased you could barely make out what the people were saying. This is more BDSM theme than spanking.
5,A Science Teacher's Review of Chemistry 101,"I am a retired science teacher, having taught Physical Science for 16 years. My bachelor's degree is in Physics with a masters in Education Curriculum. From that perspective, I would like to offer my evaluation of Chemistry 101. I have viewed all of the sessions provided in this course. I found the content and pace of instruction of this course to be outstanding. Concepts and details are presented in a very interesting manner. I would highly recommend this course for use in the home school environment. I look forward to viewing Wes Olson's forthcoming course in basic Physics."
5,"Fascinating, educational, and helpful.","A great overview of Chemistry and the history behind the Periodic Table.A PDF guidebook is included on the last CD. It is a 128 page companion book which includes quizzes. It can be printed at an office supply center.The presentation is enjoyable to watch, not goofy or insulting.My 17-year-old (who took chemistry online in High School) commented, ""This would have really helped!""The other children are now looking forward to taking chemistry as this is the program we will use."
5,Captures the soul of the American Indian,"Even though Owens has never lived on a reservation, he truly captures the soul of the American Indian. This book is a literary masterpiece and Owens joins the long list of Native masters that includes Michael Dorris, Wendy Rose, Joe Bruchac, Diane Glancy, and Jamake Highwater. If you really want to know what makes Indians tick, then read Louis Owens."
5,Owens has produced a very satisfactory read.,"This is one very nice novel, and Owens has a sharp eye for character development. I heard him read from this book a couple of years ago--and must say the laughter of the audience was echoed as I read it for myself. Let's hope this talented author keep producing these gems."
4,Not as good as Hitler Moves east but still nice,"Tells the odissey of the 2nd phase of the invasion of Russia, and, altough not as interesting as the 1rst phase (the invasion and the failure at Moscow), the Germans keep giving the Russians a hard time, untill their horrendous defeat at Kursk. The very best on both books is the soldier's letters and comments, that places you right in the front."
3,A face only a mother could love....,..but enough about me.. These cards are beautiful and endearing shots of what have to be some of the cutest critters on earth. Each portrait gives a new insight into the manifold features of the pug and is sure to delight pug lovers everywhere. However there are in effect only 5 photos (one of them being the one displayed on the box) I bought the product assuming there would be 20 different ones rather than 4 of each. Don't get me wrong each of the photos is excellent and a joy to behold but at over $2 a photo you may be better off downloading one of the many photos on the net or shelling out for the authors book. For those people intending to actually send out cards rather than hoard the photos themself this would undoubtably deserve at least 4 stars!
4,Very funny japanese comedy,"This is a very funny japanese comedy. The plot basically concerns a young woman's search for a treasure (she worked as a bank teller, and she saw the robbery's money being sunk on a pit in the forest after being abducted) and the extent to what she will go to recover it. This summary does not do justice to the movie's brillian humor. Specially funny is main actress Naomi Nishida deadpan performance."
2,Nice If it Last...Buy if you plan to use it for less than 2 years,"The TV is good...the problem, something or other always fails. My TV just shut down after 18 months and the repair cost is so high I am planning to dump the TV and move to some other brand. Checked online and found that many people had the same problem.So buy...if you plan to use it only for 2 years or are ready to shell out $500-$1000 additional on it."
5,Very impressive!,"I'm extremely pleased with the performance of this set -- and happy that I purchased it at Amazon's great price instead of what the Sony Store wanted for it! The colors are spectacular in normal mode, the light sensor keeps my retinas from burning out since I do most of my viewing after dark and with the lights out, and the multiple HDMI inputs mean my cable box and upconvert DVD player can both take advantage of this amazing technology. This is my first hi def set and my first television bigger than 27"", and I'm simply wowed -- and my side-by-side comparisons against other brands showed me that Sony really does make the best LCDs!"
5,Timid,"Having been warned numerous times not to purchase a major electronic item on the internet, I choose to ignore them and ordered this item from Amazon. It was 20 % less than I could find it at any big box store and Amazon provided free shipping. It took nine days to arrive, the carrier made an appointment for delivery, delivered as scheduled, brought the unit in, unpacked it, set it up, turned it on, allowed me to evaluate it and departed, all as advertised.It replaces a 10 year old 32"" CRT that I thought was still performing well. I am overwhelmed with the quality of the HD image and this set."
4,Great tv but for one flaw,"Colors are terrific and images are amazingly sharp. Further, the remote is easy to use...the satellite remote mimics all the features of the one that came with the tv nicely. It is lightweight for a unit of this size. The only flaw is something I read about but had to see to appreciate. There is something called ""refresh rate"", and it refers to an LCD pixel's ability to quickly change to the next color. If is is fast, you notice nothing out of the ordinary. If it is slow, objects tend to blur slightly. If someone moves their face quickly, they might appear to have saggy jowels. The most obvious example I saw was small flying insects that were flitting against a black background. They appeared as moving lines, not moving spots. This flaw is visible rarely, but it is there."
3,Quality,The experience of purchasing the tv from Amazon is great. The quality of the tv does not meet our expectation. I can see some waves in the picture. I will find out whether it is from the cable or bad quality tv.
5,Beautiful Picture. Great Price.,"I see that there's a newer model of this TV out right now, but hopefully this review of the older model will help those of you looking at purchasing the new model. We are continually amazed at the 1080p on this TV. We have it mounted in our game room, and we find ourselves drifting up there to watch TV instead of watching our Sony projection LCD TV (720p) in the family room. The picture looks great with Blu-Ray, as well as with our PS3 games. We're very happy with the purchase. Amazon's white glove delivery was also great. We were called to schedule for the delivery, and the people were on time and brought it into the house for us."
2,Clouding!!!!!!,"This model appears to have a clouding problem. The backlighting is very strong and there appears to be uneven levels of black when there is no input. The intensity of the problem varies from set to set and there is no fix for it. Some owners have reported seeing the problem in movies that have dark scenes. Sony is aware of the problem in other bravia sets, but they do not admit that this model has it too.For the money, you should not have this problem or the potential for it. Now I know it's there, it really bothers me. Too bad, I like everything else about the set. But this clouding issue is a deal breaker. It is being returned."
4,Great television,I have had this television for some time now and am quite pleased with it.The picture is clean and the sound is superb. I am a big fan of Sony products.
1,CLOUDING ISSUE WITH THE V2500,"Originally, I purchased a 40V2500 but wound up returning it to Best Buy because it had a cloudy backlight and mura effect issue. I decided to upgrade to a 40XBR2 in hopes of avoiding this problem. Unfortunately, I found the same problem with the Sony KDS-40XBR2s as well.Sony is not officially acknowledging this problem and either tells customers it is ""normal"" or suggests they return it to the store of purchase if that is an option.This is very disappointing, in my opinion. I strongly suggest googling the terms ""Sony XBR2 clouding"" and you will find an extensive thread on AVS forum regarding this subject."
4,buy this from amazon,"replaced a trinitron CRT HDTV with this product. A few things to note:product made in mexico (previous models were made in japan - if you don't think this matters, next time stop by narita airport which highlights products which are made in japan).no pip - i'm waiting for this feature for my second seteagle delivery - thumbs up. i wanted to keep my box and not have them open the product. the driver noted some physical damage to the box on the invoice (turned out it was not an issue)lame remote - works fine, but expected a bit more from a product this expensivesteady volume control is a plusfinally, the post-order price guarantee policy was awesome - amazon saved me over $100 and piece of mind knowing that at least for 30 days, i'm protected."
2,Best Picture and best performance,"I couldn't wait to set this TV up at my house. The picture is superior to ANY TV in its class. I couldn't see the extra money,( $400.00 more), on the XBR model. The picture on 1080 is incedible. Highly recommend!!"
4,Very Pleased,"We've had the Bravia 40"" KDL-40V2500 for about a month and am using Dish Satellite for the signal. The HD image is definitely worth the purchase. Easy shipping and delivery from Amazon. Watching TV shows, the Discovery Channel, and movies is great. There's even an HD all news channel which has an amazing look. The unit has a lot of connection possibilities. The sound is pretty good. Non-HD TV looks quite nice. So far, nothing much to complain about, except not enough HD channels to watch."
4,this is the fire,"its like Tom Petty, remixed by David Lynch.1) ""la news"" is a great start2) ""dance..."" just gets better with repeated listening3) ""sit still long enough"" is haunting its so good (one of my favorite songs ever)4) ""days.."" is a good rocker8) ""settling"" makes girls melt9) ""radio waits.."" is strong11) ""Weasal"" is weasal"
5,Fantastic!,"I'm not typically one to read a book like this, but everyone should! It takes only seconds a day to read, yet provides thought for the entire day! Looking at quotes from the Bible through Ms. Geitz's feminine eyes allows every woman the opportunity to feel comfortable with themselves. Thank you!"
4,"Good movie, good disk condition","This movie was great! Boy meats girl, boy & girl fall in love, girl gets hooked on boy's mother's experimental hair removal drug, drug works but turns girl into an animal, boy has to hunt down the monster he created, it's a tail as old as time! This film has everything: love, hate, nudity, blood, freaky fun, & a French kiss that'll knock your socks off!As for the DVD itself, it was in good condition; worn, but not enough to mess up the movie.I give the movie 4 stars & the DVD 3, overall 3 3/4 stars, you won't be dissapointed."
3,its ok,"its an ok movie if u like the freak show kinda horror movie. its not ur typical werewolf movie. it has ok acting, some well known actors,male and female nudity. if u like shawn ashmore nude this movie is for u. but other than that its not so great."
2,Pathetic werewolf,"Everytime I think something amazing is going to happen or some transformation ...zip happens. This movie builds up to nothing. I guess the script tried to keep it realistic througout the movie but it ended up being boring! I thought there would be thrills and special effects but it was just about this grossly hairy looking young girl in a circus- wolfgirl. She befriends a nerd who seems to have the answers to her prayers of ridding herself of her body hair. Not very clever and disappointing, frustrating. The teenagers are just plain annoying."
4,"I was in it, haha","I'm the kid who says ""Those are the biggest boobs I've ever seen"", haha. Working on the set was great, the title was ""Welcome to the Freakshow"" or ""Freakshow"" at the time, but they changed it much later, and I don't like the new title. The script needed more work and there were sections where I felt like nothing was happening - like any other movie I guess. Besides that , it was great."
1,Blood Moon...Give Me A Break,"Blood Moon is a very slow, twisted movie. It wastes the talent of the stars. Tim Curry, in this piece of garbage...come on. Shawn Ashmore ""Iceman"" of X-Men fame is in this movie too. You get to see him in a towel and dance around half naked and then his towel falls. Let's hope that what we see no one else does, this could really damage his ""preformance"" or ""ability"". Overall a waste of time."
4,a.k.a Wolf Girl,"Don't be fooled by the silly cover art or the lame title.. this is a really good movie! After watching the movie I realized that the alternative title ""Wolf Girl"" which this film is (also known as) ..is a much more suitable title. The movie is more about her than any of the other side show entertainers. Everything revolves around her. There are many sights to see in the movie from Grace Jones as a half man half woman, Darlene Cates as a 600 pound + + size woman, midgets, deformed people plus, others that are harder to explain. Tim Curry plays a father figure to the young girl born wolf-like. He is sorta the same with the others in the freakshow but, more so with her. I think the movie kinda teaches a few valuable lessons that I will just let you experience for yourself. Each viewer will take away different things from the message the film holds but, I think I will stop judging people based on whats on the outside. ""3 1/2 stars"""
3,WAS A GOOD LITTLE MOVIE!!,"I bought this DVD because all these good reviews, but this movie really not in horror category at all!! Is more drama/suspense / thriller, was a good movie but not horror for sure. If u like drama kind of suspense movies..Not scary or gore type, then this movie for u. .But not to buy. Because one time seen would be enough, because after one time seen u don't want watch it again and again in long run! Not that interesting, Wish I was just renting instead waste my money on this DVD."
2,some of you must be watching a different movie,"I rented this because I seen a few people on here liked it, but let me tell you, it wasn't so hot!. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was the scene with the poodle.The break down: cheesy FX, it did have an original story line, not enough carnage, too much time killing (and not enough real killing), TRIED TOO HARD TO BE A MUSICAL!!!!! Every few minutes you will be treated with a musical/singing/dancing with the sideshow freaks (yea, yea, I know, someone right now is thinking, well that sounds cool, trust me its not!! sound of music meets teen wolf!!!) Its that bad!"
4,Great Harmonies,Loved this DVD. Crosby and Nash at their best. They need to let the political references drop however. Their harmonies are still superb.
4,"Wasn`t quite what I expected, but still an interesting book","The book wasn`t what I expected. While it covers a large number of manufacturers, it`s focus is much more on the fancy high dollar,and european cars than I had expected. The Complete Encyclopedia of Antique Cars is far from complete. But considering that ittries to cover many different countries over a period of 50 years that really can`t be helped. To be complete would requireseveral volumes. There are many photos and a fair amount of info on the manufacturers that are covered.Still, I wish it had been focused on the more common cars. Over all, it`s not a bad book."
1,Disappointing ending for Alf fans,"I introduced Alf to my children via Hulu, and they have slowly enjoyed watching most of the episodes. Looking for an end to Alf, they watched Project Alf. Big mistake. It ended up being something that upset everyone. (Spoiler Alert from here on) Alf never gets back to the Tanners and seems to have just 'forgotten' about them as they have supposedly forgotten about him and moved to Iceland ?!?!? Give me a break. Like he would forget about the Tanners after all those years, and like they would move to Iceland. Because he never got back to the Tanners, nor even to his fellow Aliens, it was pretty upsetting to my children, some of whom were in tears over it. Anyway, there was no happy close for Alf lovers. I would rather that the show ""Project Alf"" was never shown in our home."
3,Finally an ending :),"After the series was unexpectedly ended with a huge cliffhanger at the end of season 4 where ALF is discovered, you never know what happened to him. I was born in '86 and grew up with ALF, so I always wanted to know what happened to him! When I leaned of this DVD, I knew I HAD to have it!The story of the movie was lacking, as was the acting and the production, but the ALF comedy was classic!!! Same ole, same ole alfer! :) I was very pleased to know the ALF comedy was still there, being that this was released in 2005 about a show from the 80's.I was disappointed the Tanner family wasn't a part of this movie, but it was nice to finally have closure and find out what happened with ALF. :) I'd recommend it for any fan of the original series."
3,"""Let's not follow in Bill Cosby's footsteps""","Okay, the movie wasn't that great. I admit that. I admit that there's no Tanner family, no cats and no reason that die-hard fans of ALF wouldn't like this movie. ALF was on when I was 4 or 5. I barely remember anything from ALF until I bought the first season on DVD. And I was a die-hard ALF fan. I even had a talking ALF doll. I even dressed like ALF one Halloween when I was about the right size to BE ALF.ALF is in trouble. No surprise there, since he was always in trouble in the show. But now, he's in deep trouble as we see the lovable alien is at an Airforce Base. One general wants to kill ALF for what he did to his mother. It's not the best movie, but at least it tried to be funny."
1,Project ALF...,"Project: AlfMajor dissapointment !I love the ""normal"" episodes with ALF and the Tanner family, but this is just an attempt to make money on somthing that once was."
3,"Looks fine, but...","I have not used the carrier as of yet but the center receiver bar is made of the same metal as the rest of the carrier. This may or may not cause a problem but most receiver bars are made of 1/4 "" steel and this on is 1/8"" steel. My concern, although unfounded at this time, is that it may not hold up when the carrier is fully loaded. The description indicates it is rated for up to 500 lbs and I hope it is correct."
3,"Too long, full of typographical errors","I took my introductory semantics with the first edition of this book some years ago, and was very recently teaching assistant for an advanced undergrad/introductory graduate introduction to semantics which used the second edition. It is horribly wordy and long, something which the second edition, rather than fix, worsened. Also, the book is full all over with typographical errors: above all, misnumbered references to examples and errors in formulas conspire to make many passages in this book barely descipherable. Whoever allowed this book to be published without being carefully corrected doesn't deserve their job. An online web page with errata is sorely needed.The field of introductory books to model-theoretic semantics, however, is quite a barren one, and this book does very well when compared with the competition (e.g. Heim and Kratzer's textbook)."
4,Great energetic pop-rock with attitude!,"I love the boy-girl vocals and raw guitar sound. Fun lyrics, catchy songwriting. Makes me proud to be from San Francisco!"
1,"Oh, sweet hell.",Rebecca: contractions are YOUR FRIEND. Study them! Use them! Love them! You won't be sorry! See? 'won't be'! There's an example! You can do it!
1,Wish they had less than one star,"This is another hollow novel by a boring author. I was gifted Girl Anatomy but perused through this one day at my local library, for the hell of it, figuring if Miss Bloom had a second novel out, she must have grown as a writer.Boy was I wrong. I started reading and found same old story, tired, shallow, narcissistic.I am shocked when I read like 4 or 5 stars as her average on here. This book is worst than the first one. Stay away from it. Read literary fiction, folks, because while it may not have the fun girl power allusions of single modern culture, it is actual substance and good language"
5,"If you Have Italian Friends or Family, You Absolutely Will Like this Book","The Author, Bepper Severgnini, offers a funny look at the lifestyle and manners of his modern Italian countrymen, how they thing and how they interact with each other. The book offers an interesting and pleasant read for anyone who knows or have close contact with people with an Italian background.Many of my friends' parents in College where Italian Immigrants and currently I'm working overseas in an Italian Owned Company, so many of my co-workers and friends are from Italy. Additionally back at home my Sister's Husband is Italian so In my case I really found the book to be both revealing and hilarious, helping my understand many of my friends habits and the way they act under certain circumstances. Of course the book is not a sociology study but an enjoyable look at the ""Modern Italian Mind"""
2,Not so mindful,"There is so much about the Italian culture that is humorous... I think because, unlike people in most other Western cultures, Italians know that humor, even about themselves, is not inconsistent with intelligence or sexiness. In my estimation, La Bella Figura fell short in the humor arena. I did not laugh much, or find it very interesting. Having been to Italy several times, and studied with Italians, experiencing their wonderful senses of humor, I really expected to find it much more fun, or have much more depth. I would have preferred both."
1,Empty babble,"Severgnini's writing is more about being ""clever"" in style and phrases than actually saying anything. What he writes about Italy could apply to almost any western country; the book is empty and without insight."
2,Disappointing,"When I purchased this DVD I was expecting to watch a documentary the level of BBC or National Geographic. Unfortunately the scientific informations provided by this video scarcely fill one disc and the remaining topics in other 3 discs are only about curiosities, popular beliefs, ancient legends and bugs being used as medicine and food. Differently from David Attenborough's serious documentaries where his interference is minimun and necessary, the presence of Georges Brossard (a mixture of actor, clown and ontologist) is annoying. He wishes to be the star of the show more than the insects. Unbelievably, even the scientfic informations provided by him are limited and not new: The only insects' way-of-life he focus in detail are ants and termites but all of these informations can be found in documentaries not specialized in insects such as BBC's The Life of Plants and Trials of Life. The two stars go to some beautiful closes on insects and that's all."
1,Dissapointment,"THis is not a documentary about insects. It is a collection of amature caliber location shots starring the commentator - sparingly peppered with stock footage of bugs purchased from WGBH and others. The only thing that is good about this set is the packaging that it comes in - which is what led me to purchase it. It is, however, quite deceptive as to what the content of the DVD's actually is. I cannot emphasize enough - If you want a box set about the ""Crocodile Hunter"" of the insect world shot with a cheap video camera - this is your DVD. If you were looking for information and footage of insects (as I was) you will be totally dissapointed."
2,Not even Microsoft has stooped this low!,"I am a film student trying to get some work done and what do I discover? Those lovely, FREE updates to iTunes, iPhoto and iMovie (included in this software) make it so that if you want to export from iMovie to iDVD, you have to upgrade iDVD. Now guess what the only way you can accomplish that is! By buying this software package. So, you get to spend your fifty bucks on one piece of software and the upgrades for the other 3 that are available for FREE from Apple. So basically, they screw you into buying iLife to complete the upgrade. Seriously, Microsoft isn't so underhanded!!! Shame on you, Apple!!!"
5,Awesome!,I bought this for my adult daughter for Christmas. She is into painting and was thrilled with this set. It arrived on time and was packaged very securely. The presentation was awesome and made a great impression upon opening. All of the pieces are of good quality and everything works well. I also included an inexpensive sketch book with it so that the one included could be used for the final artwork (it is good quality paper). It is a great gift and would highly recommend for anyone experienced or just getting started.
4,Nice Caligraphy Set,"I myself know little about caligraphy. My wife however enjoys painting, caligraphy and has studied Japanese language. So putting all this info together I found this caligraphy set. She was very impressed and said she would get lots of use out of it. It looked fairly complete with an assortment of brush sizes (5 included). The box is nicely constructed, covered and inlaid with what I assume is silk fabric. She thinks I paid alot more for this than I actually did. This is a must have for the artist with an interest in Japan."
3,Damaged Goods,"The packaging is nice and all looked well until we opened the box. The Grinding/Mixing stone is different than the one pictured, will have to figure out how to use this one as it has a small raised well in the middle and then what amounts to a moat around that. But the bad thing was the marble paperweight was broken into three pieces on opening of the case and appears to be crumbling, wonder if it truly is marble. The rest of the set looks nice and I'm eager to try it once I hear back from amazon and the seller about the broken paperweight. The accordion booklet is nice, but I'll be doing an awful lot of practice before I even consider attempting to use it, would hate to ruin it with an amateur attempt/goof.I do wish the brushes had come in an assortment of sizes rather than all being the same size, but I can always purchase more brushes."
3,Rather Anticlimactic...,"While it presents an interesting picture of Old Times...monks and such...it goes a bit slow for my tastes. I thought this book deserved three stars because it provided an interesting look into the mind of the author (a former teacher of mine). I thought it was a bit anticlimactic; it ended before i knew it was going to...so it lost a few stars there because I HATE BOOKS THAT HAVE BAD ENDINGS...It's worth a read, though."
3,Monastacism brought to life,"Being a fan of anything Celtic, I was intrigued by the title and description of this book. I had never heard of Columcille, although the name Columba was somewhat familiar. From tribal chieftain, to monastic novice and eventually missionary to Scotland, Columcille led a fascinating life. Desjarlais has carefully researched the history of this saint and vividly brought him and his world to life. An easy and interesting read. Great chance to learn some little-know Church history in a way that is as entertaining as it is educational."
4,Wonder Woman Costume,"I really like the costume and everything fits me very well... I am of slender build and have long thin legs.. The boot covers are tight on my legs and I can see where they would not fit everyone...these should probably come in different sizes... the outfit would not be complete without them....The service was great, got it within just a few days... thanks Amazon!!"
3,"CATALINA YES, OTHERS PUT A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD","I agree with the last reviewer. Catalina is to die for, but the others, men and women, should not only leave their clothes on, but they should also put bags over their heads. This same advice applies to the previous movies in this series as well--please put a big over your face and leave your clothes on."
3,"Caltalina Yes, Others Please Leave Your Clothes On!","Certainly, Catlina has always represented the intelligent man's fantacy woman. She is sophisticated, intellegent, and comes across as being very elligant. She certainly deserves to be the star of this movie. I would like to add, however, that the other women in the film should do us a favor and leave your clothes on!"
4,Five Stars For The Music,"Excellent packaging. Music sounds great. Unfortunately the booklet is less than desirable. In the 'track by track commentary' (the entire second half of the booklet) instead of historical significant information for each song from those who were there, the commentary is from industry insiders (Donna Summer????) who state how the music impacted their lives. Too bad; a lost opportunity. A package such as should be historical and not opinionated. 5 stars for the music tho. Saw Jersey Boys on Broadway. See it if you get a chance. You will NOT be disappointed!"
4,Dennis Sullivan,This is definately the set to get if you want a Hits Collection of The Four Seasons & Frankie Valli's solo hits. I wish there were more footage on the DVD.
5,Great Collection,"Excellent collection of some of the great songs recorded by the Four Seasons, a great compilation, well done."
5,GREAT MEMORIES,WOW I REALLY ENJOYED LISTENING TO THIS. BROUGHT BACK FOUND MEMORIES IF YOU LIKE FRANKIE VALLI & THE 4 SEASONS YOU'LL REALLY LIKE THIS SET
4,Great follow up for those who have seen Jersey Boys,This product is highly recommended for anyone who has seen Jersey Boys. The booklet is very interesting with a lot of information and background material.
4,Searching for that elusive stereo compilation,"It's inexplicable that Rhino just couldn't bring itself to putting all the stereo versions of Let's Hang On, Dawn and Rag Doll on ONE compilation. They have appeared separately in various compilations. ACE came close by putting stereo versions of Let's Hang On and Dawn on the 'Edizione d'oro'. The Philips double LP of the same title have all the tracks in stereo. The stereo track, 'Let's Hang On', on this Jersey Beat compilation sounds very similar to that on the Edizione d'oro, with the starting refrain in 'mono'."
5,YES!!!!,"Let me start by I was born in Jersey in 1983. But I grew up to the sounds of WCBSFM 101.1 from NYC. This of course included many of The Four Season's Hits. I have an original vinyl copy of Gold Vault of Hits that, for a while, constantly played in my parent's turntable. I love The Four Seasons. This collection should be in every home in America (and around the world). It allows me to discover even more songs that until now I didn't know existed. BUY THIS COLLECTION. As far as I'm concerned, it's a steal at this price."
2,What a let down,"Over at chameleon's blog the long-standing UK Appreciation Society said of this release..""When it comes down to the `sound' of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons it seems that fans have been done a disservice over the years. The recent Box Set issue of Jersey Beat was a missed opportunity and the muddy mono mixes and disappointing 60s stereo mixes leaves this groups `definitive', sound quality compilation a distant dream.""This is a great package and notes but terrible mastering. A disgrace really as others have commented. When will someone invest in properly re-mastering these classic recordings?"
4,The Jersey Beat..Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons,"I found the CD's included several songs I had never heard them sing before. The DVD was great, demonstrating the old choreography of their era. In general,the package was very entertaining and I received it in a fairly quick manner."
2,Not the movie,"I grew up loving Louisa May Alcott's books! A family member purchased the ""An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving"" movie for me last month. Although a few parts of the movie were a little strange (the Lord Byron statue!)I enjoyed it. I had never heard of the book, so I got right on Amazon to order it. Frankly, I am surprised that the movie was allowed to say that it was based on the book. While the movie is about a poor widow with three children who can't have a Thanksgiving meal, a rich grandmother who comes to visit after a letter, and a romance, the book is entirely different. It is a rather dull tale of how a large household of children have to partially prepare the dinner since their mother is called away when told the grandmother is ill. This is one book I should have left out of my collection."
3,Below expectations,"I like a few of the songs and love one of them.but beyond that there isn't a lot that's going to keep me listening. Though I can compile a greatest hits from it, in the end, it was a ah... disappointment.sorry"
4,BETTY CROCKER'S NEW OUTDOOR COOKBOOK,"If you like outdoor cooking this is a very good book. However, as it is quite old make sure the seller is honest about it condition before you purchase it. Because of fraud, I returned the book to the seller"
4,I like it,"I like it. BUT the back zipper is not wide enough for my planner, and my planner is not that big. So I have to open the bag, stringcord and magnetic closeure, to put it in there. AND the cell phone pouch is slim, doesn't fit my phone. I think it will only fit a really slim phone. I got the brown by mistake, mine, but I really like the color. The leather though not the top notch quality, is not cheap looking either. It's modest without being ugly. I replaced my purse with it. The outside pocket fits my travel-size Bible, and the little outside zip pocket I squeeze my car keys into. It would make a great purse for a teenage girl since they don't carry much. I'm going to find a leather backpack that's a little bigger and give this to a friends daughter when I do."
2,Not too good,"I really buy this backpack with a certain risk because I read the reviews, i received it last week, and it's nice, soft; but i used it yesterday and in the part of the back where the snaps are, something coming off , I find that to be new this should not happen!, I'm not very happy with this = ( ."
5,"Cute, roomy, functional","Got the purse in a very reasonable amount of time. The quality of the leather is nice, soft but not flimsy, the stitching is tight and discrete. The bag looks nice and has enough room for checkbook, water bottle, coupon organizer, cell phone, and then I carry snacks because I tend to nibble. Very pleased."
4,"Great ""purse-backpack""","I bought this product 6 months ago and it has been used heavily, almost every single day. I use it when I am biking around so it is exposed to the elements, even during the winter. It is still in great condition! None of the leather has dulled or rubbed off or anything, and the straps are still working great and haven't snapped or even seem very worn at all. It is smaller than I expected, and it could be improved with a few more pockets on the inside. The easy-access zipper on the back is very useful for getting small items out of it that I don't feel like undoing the entire bag to get. The outside pockets are great for storing items such as cell phones, iPods, and chap stick. This is a great bag and I definitely got my moneys worth.My one problem is that the magnetic part seems to be wearing out already, but the tie around the top prevents that from being a problem."
1,Bad quality,"I cannot recommend this item. When I tried to close the bag for the first time, the lock fell. Very bad quality..."
2,"Cheap look, rough made, too small for women, suit for teens.","I'm very disappointed with this backpack. It's too small and cheap looking for women with child. May be it's good for teens. It would be useful to make other photo to realize size.I have backpack from Le Donne and it's much better, leather is thick but soft.And this one is rough, shiny like PVC and smell awfully. I wish I could return it."
4,Just as it was advertised,So far the bag has done just what I wanted it to do--carry all my stuff around with me. I'm happy with the service.
5,Great backpack,I love my new purse. Its so great that my daughter tried to use it before me. LOL!!! Thank You for a quality leather for a low low price.
2,Didn't look like for a woman and snaps come off,"The first disappointment was the look of the leather. It's rough and rugged and looks like it's more for a man. I returned it because the snap closure kept coming off and once spilled my contents at the airport!One good thing is the customer service. As soon as I emailed them that I wanted to return it, they replied with instructions."
3,Nice but...,The bag is small but it fits standard size spiral notebooks easily and that's all I usually carry around for school. Much cuter than a school bag. I got the brown color and it is much lighter than the one pictured. Also the bag seems to be made of two different leathers. The bottom and back of the bag have much higher quality leather. The front of the bag has very thin and shiny leather which makes the bag look really cheap.
1,"Bad, Bad, Not kidding! Non-sticking, yeah right!","Bought several wearever products and all of them after a few recipes stopped working as a non-sticking surface. The cakes started sticking, cookies would cook uneven,etc... The quality of anything from Wearever Pro products (I bought several of the pan combo packaegs) are not worth the price of admission. In fact, I have a cheap set of non-stick bakeware from a competitor (costing 1/3) the price and they are still working after 5 years. I will never buy anything from this company again and I reccommend the same for anyone intersted, buy something from another company, either more expensive or cheaper you can't do any worse."
4,Great Album,"For those of you who are not familiar with Bishop Larry D. Trotter and the Sweet Holy Spirit Congregration, you need to get this album. They have that familiar Chicago sound ala Ricky Dillard and New G, Milton Brunson & Thompson Community, etc. This album offers exuberant praise songs, good old-fashioned foot stompers, and songs that will lead you into the presence of God. It reminds of New G's ""No Limit"" album. It's along that same vibe. This album will not disappoint you in any way. Buy and enjoy."
3,Alright,"This is a nice album for a praise and worship leader but if you are a choir director, I advise you not to purchase the album because there is really only two good choir songs. The album seems like it lost the choir feel like it was displayed in Tell The Devil I'm Back and Their best recording What's to come is better than what's been. The two good choir songs are don't you give up and blessing me. Like I said, if you are a praise and worship leader, this is a good album for you but if you are a director looking for a good choir album, ask your praise and worship leader if you can borrow it and record don't you give up and blessing me."
4,wonderfully unconventional,"The current debate over Brahms among music scholars is whether romantic interpretation should be applied to his music. Brahms was a neo-classical romantic period composer. He disliked wagner's music passionately, and took more after Beethoven than any other composer. Whether he would like this recording or not is questionable. At times over-indulgent in dramatic conventions, this recording gives the most romantic version of the symphonies that I can call to mind. It is beautifully done however, and is certainly passionate, and very enjoyable, if not historically accurate. This five disc set encompasses music of one of the orchestral masters in a way that few conductors dare to present it. The Berlin Philharmonic plays absolutely beautifully. If you dont mind dramatic interpretations of Brahms, this set is well worth the money. If you already own a more standard collection, this makes a great second set of the works."
4,a good starter,if your a beginning strop enthusiast then this is a good start. reasonable quality at an excellent price. puts a wicked edge on my blades and provides adequate instruction and tools to get you on your way. Would definitely recommend it..
3,Nancy Drew Book # 1,"Over all I think Without A Trace was an okay book. I liked it because it is very exciting and keeps you out of your seat. It is fulled with suspence ( though it does go back and explain everything at the right times). Though it is better than the ""old series"", I think that Nancy Drew appears a little to perfect at times. She all most always does the right things and isn't very ""real"". The book also includes details that are not important to the plot and talks to much about fashion. It always says what she's wearing, if her clothes match ect. Though Nancy Drew still seems a bit perfect this book is much better than the old books. I like this book better because Nancy's friends are included more in the book and you are not eft wondering.I think Without A Trace was an okay book."
2,Same ole' Same ole'!,"I was really excited about seeing this new Nancy Drew series. I really thought the character of Nancy would be more mature, and that the characters would be put in more mature situations. But, I was wrong. This book is even more childish then the series was back in the 1930's. Very disappointing.Oh yeah, Amazon will charge you $5 for this book but the cover price is only .99 cents. for US buyers, and Canadians. If you look closing you can see it on the front of the cover.Your welcome."
2,hmmmm,"Without a Trace by Carolyn Keene is part of a pretty dumb run off series from the original Nancy Drew. In the book Nancy is in high school or college, it isn't really clear. However she seems like a third grader! The book was childish and pretty boring. Nothing like the original series. The story was that someone was smashing zucchini in Nancy's neighborhood (????) and a valuable Faberge egg was stolen from a newcomer in town. Of course Nancy solved both mysteries. (...) The characters were not at all well developed and the storyline was pretty dumb. I mean seriously... smashed zucchini? This book may be good for younger kids."
1,Bring back the old Nancy!,"I have read Nancy Drew for 50 years and still enjoy them. I have all the titles published, but I am not fond of this new Nancy. I have been used to the fast paced, rough and tumble adventures. (I admit she should have a serious head problem with all the times she was hit over the head). I have read the first 5 in this new series and it seems you are almost to page 100 before you are sure there is really a true mystery, most is speculation. I agree with another reviewer the the mysteries seem silly compared to the old series. In the older books, you knew what the mystery (or at least one of them) was right of the bat. I hope they get better as I would hate to stop collecting them for my Grandaughters."
5,Tommy Banks,"This guy, who I never heard of is Unbelievable. I first heard a cut of this on Toronto jazz 91. I knew I had to have this album.If you can play anything like Tommy, I will buy your album too!!"
5,One of the great solo pianists,"Tommy Banks is one of Canada's shining stars, and in many respects this is due to his own success in the music business. Like many before him, notably Luckey Roberts, Banks has been busy making a successful living in the music business in Canada and not soley focussed on become ""famous"". But Banks is a true classic and a pianist that every fan of jazz piano should have in their collection.This album is a beautiful overview of Tommy's grasp on the history of jazz and includes a wide variety of styles, sounds approaches and colours.His ballads are beautifully textured and constructed, his swing is strong and driving and his soloing is a combination of hot, cool and blues. But above all - this album is totally ""Banks"" in every way.Buy it. You'll love it. We need more from Tommy. More solo piano especially. Let's hope he decides to do it again and again."
3,Non Fiction,"Dinosaurs of Australia and New Zealand : and Other Animals of the Mesozoic Era by John A. Long takes a look at recent work in the field, as well as an overview by one of Australia's eminent paleontological teams.It is good to get a book about what is going on locally as opposed to finds all over the Northern Hemisphere."
1,"burn it! along with meatballs 2,3,5,6,7,26?","I almost lost my lunch (pizza and vodka) when I saw this movie with the great name MEAT BALLS in it.Trust Nipsey folks, The first Meatballs with MR. BILL MURRAY is the only one you need.These spin offs are as bad as the pizza and vodka mix I had for lunch.Don't waste your time!I think I will be sick now after all."
2,skip the meatballs,I bought this movie becuse my wife did the jetski stunts in it. Aside from that there wouldnt be any reason to watch it or buy it. It was rated one of the fifty worst movies of all time and it probably is.
4,MAYBE THE FUNNIEST LINE IN a 90's FILM,"I know it was said, but after all the credits role, the viewer thinks the last shot was a freeze frame on Corey kissing some girl, the credits stop she pushes him off and says ""EEWWW your not even a star!"" Feldman turns to look into the camera and says ""Not a star, I was in Goonies!"" I haven't laughed that hard in a long time, it was so un expected it made up for a boring movie."
2,It has Corey Feldman in it. Gotta be bad.,Truely a bad movie. Deserves no stars but for the fact it has Kristi Ducati and Neriah Davis in it. Those wonderful babes give it its two stars.
5,CRL Windshield and Body Sealant,This is a good product. And works very well and the correct product to use to seal windows and seams.RagenRat
3,weird stuff,"there are no directions with this stuff. the side of the tube says something about 'when dry'. it never dries as in dry to the touch, it is permanently sticky. i assume it works as there has been no water leakage since i used it, but either i got a bad batch, or they could explain the process a little more."
5,Hey,"can u lower the price because I would really like to buy this cool, awesome, fantastic season of winx club!! :)"
2,how avakian rolls...,"I totally concur with another reviewer, who described the book as ""Quibbling and Vague"" and ""rather doctrinaire."" I agree with his sections about bourgeois democracy largely, but no amount of Mao quoting will prove to me that freedom, personal liberty and democracy are the decadent expectations of westerners. If you find Avakian's hazy descriptions of what a future socialist society based on his ideas would look like, look no further than China under Mao. I imagine something might be a bit better or a bit different, but that is the world this particular Great Leader envisions for humanity.Short and sweet: 1 1/2 stars; worth picking up used for analysis on bourgeois democracy."
2,Needed A Stronger Editor,"I thought his first book was just great so I had high hopes for this one. I would say that it is a bit of a let down, not much more then an average work. The pace is great but I think the author needs some help in the overall construction of the story. There is a lot going on, many sub plots - normally that makes for a much more engrossing book, but here it did not work as well. It seemed to me that he had so many plots he could not devote enough time to each one thus detracting from the overall effect of the book. I also thought, although he devoted a good amount of time to them, the characters were not as engrossing as some of his others. Overall the book was ok in the genre, but it seemed like he rushed this one out the door without some much needed detailing."
2,"""Top-notch Turow"" saved by humor","In this plot the author identifies himself with Malloy, a timid copper turned attorney. While rowing through the pages you find yourself to be lost in a vast ocean with very little intrigue, while the author dabbles in extensive introspection. Every good plot needs a villain. Meet Pigeyes the notorious comrade from the past. When crossing the equator of this bestseller, I was still in the doldrums hoping for a storm but the story continued to splash along with more introspection. There are a few scenes strewn throughout for laughing out loud, for which I gratefully bestow an extra star. While my mind wandered and Malloy was having another drink, I was rowing on `til the end: ""There are only victims."" Yes, the ones who think that this book meets the burden of proof to justify its existence. Gerborg"
5,"bitter, funny ""legal mystery""","I read and enjoyed the first two Turow novels (let's ignore 1L or whatever that law school book he wrote is called), but they are normal legal thrillers, although much more substantial than anything by Grisham (whom I also enjoy). But this book was a surprise and a delight to me. It's an hilarious dark comedy that has a nifty little whodunnit as a spine. If you are looking for a normal ""hero comes through"" book, this isn't it. But it is an acutely observed, bleak comedy of manners with what I found to be a very logical, but satisfactory, ending."
5,Laugh-out-loud funny and suspenseful,"I wasn't prepared for how funny this book would turn out to be. The plot isn't as memorable as Presumed Innocent, but the main character is much more likable.I'm always looking for a suspenseful book that is intelligently written and this one has great humor besides."
3,Average book,"This was my first Turow read. I thought it was decent, but not exceptional. I won't read another of his"
4,"Enjoyable reading, unsatisfying ending","This is the second Turow book that left me flat at the end. Most of the book is good reading, leaving you anxious to see what comes next, but as was the case with the Laws of Our Fathers, I found the ending to be rather dissapointing. I will concede, however,that I listened to the abridged version and will allow for the possibility that I missed something in the abridgement. Overall, Turow writes a good story."
3,"Ethics, ethics","I confess, I heard the audio book version. It was pretty interesting, and well read by Stacey Keach. But I think Mack should have given the money back, in the end. He said he'd be drinking heavily again, even with his millions of dollars. I can see why: his conscience would never be clean. Well, it's only fiction, right? Diximus."
2,God what a slog!,"God what a slog! This book was like an awful automobile accident that you know you should quit looking at but you can't pull your eyes away! Yes, there are twists in the plot but they come way too late to make the book interesting and there isn't a single redeeming character. If you're in a serious mid-life crisis read this one; otherwise skip it!"
1,A terrible and boring book,I am sorry I took the time to finish this book. The author went on and on as though he had to fill the pages with words; but they contributed nothing to the story. So many of his other books are great; but certainly not this one. Read the works of Steve Martini if you want a fast paced and funny lawyer novel.
4,A Good Read,"This book is a terrific read. Turow's next-best work to Presumed Innocent. I leave off the last star for the ending, which doesn't quite tie up all the loose ends, but that is a common flaw in this genre."
2,Disappointed,"I have always really enjoyed reading anything by Scott Turrow, but this one really disappointed me. His books are usually page-turners, but I had to work at finishing this one."
3,"Honestly, I thought Grisham would have done a better job.","This is certainly a decent read but I need to care at least a little about the characters, and these clowns are mostly jerks. Turow is a great writer, but this particular plot seemed to wander too much. The ending pays off nicely, though."
1,Step by Step Guide?,"The box lists approx running time of 55 min., the tape says 36 min. However long it really is...it's pretty worthless. If you want an overview of reflexology, if you want to hear two reflexologists drone on and on about the benefits of it, this tape is for you. I wanted to learn some technique, but was very dissapointed. I guess you get what you pay for. I won't be buying any more videos available from ""Current"". Anyone want to buy a used video...cheap?"
1,Forbidden Spring Break,This video is one of the worst that I have seen from the GGW series. It features only topless flashing on different locations. It has nothing to break the monotony of the topless flashing. It does not deserve your time or money.
1,horrible total waste of money/time,"I ""bought"" this off the internet, and i have to say i deleted it off my computer as soon as i watch about 15 minutes worth. It really didn't have any content on it, it seemed like one of the adds they run on tv, but worse; the thing about this dvd was it actually made me feel bad about watching it. This is certainly the worst of the GGW vids, the best ones aren't even available here (amazon), so if you are looking to buy a good one heres stop right now, the only somewhat good one here is the one with 4 1/2 stars."
5,"Great season, Great DVD","This DVD is awesome, it has highlights from every single game, and great behind the scenes footage. What a great season by the Arizona Cardinals! This DVD helps relive some of there magical 2008 season and run to the Super Bowl."
3,Front torn apart,It's such a good book but the owner didn't take good care of it. The front of the book was torn. The rest seems ok until now.
4,A Beat For Everyone,"The beauty of this two disc CD is that it gives Seb a chance to allow the listener to explore a diverse sound of beats. I prefer Disc 2 over 1, but that's b/c I love the trance he brings into it. I've owned this CD for 4 years now, and I'm STILL playing it at least twice a month (CD 2)...and I had to go back to the store to find his other Prototypes...which at times I'm just as pleased, and sometimes not so pleased. Either way, his style never fails to make my body move to the beat!"
3,This is a mixed bag,"For a 49-year-old, I listen to a lot of trance - in fact, sometimes I thrive on it. Seeing the other reviews here, I pounced on ordering this CD. When it arrived, I quickly put on the first CD, and waited for it to ""warm up to me"" or pick up. I waited & waited... then I realized I was nodding off to insistent (and quite boring) repetitive rhythms. Great if you're an insomniac. CD 2 is quite a bit better, but still uneven. I prefer dynamic and varied paces, melodies you can get behind, and music that gets me going. Only certain cuts on this CD do that for me, so I was somewhat disappointed.Now 2002: I've revisited this CD, and I must confess I'm liking it more - it may grow on you."
5,sasha...digweed...paul...SEB,"a few weeks ago i had never heard of seb fontaine .. i asked what was new at my local dj shop ... this is what they put in for me to listen to .... it wasn't long before this was all i listened to .. seb fontaine is amazing to say the least .... just when you think a track is on its way out he brings you back then shoots you to the stars .... sasha, john digweed, bt, paul van dyke are all amazing but seb fontaine brings a new element to the arena ..you be the judge"
2,Eh,"The 'other girls' song is cute, but this reminds me of the follows up to pocahontas and cinderella and the little mermaid. Aladin's did well enough to make more, but...I think it really does have to do with the music. Mulan had that strong ""reflection"" by christina aguilera when she was first coming out, that established her as THE best voice, and that song, in spanish or english works well on it's own also. These sequals keep failing to have a strong song. The strengths here lie with the new score, new themes. It's easier to create a better classical piece for Disney it seems. And they have so many talented singers at their disposal..."
1,Don't bother with cybiko,"The company is now defunct and the technology, too. The toy is no longer sold or supported."
1,sellout,"Penzler and Block sold out to the literary establishment on this one. Or maybe it was Michele Slung. Anyway, it seems like they chose any story--no matter how pointless and uninteresting--with a crime in it that appeared in a 'literary magazine'. Trying to brown-nose some credibility perhaps? Anyway, don't read this if you're looking for a good mystery of crime story. Try Gorman's 'World's Finest Mystery and Crime Stories'. This one's a waste."
1,Don't Bother,"I signed in just to warn off fellow readers. I was deeply disappointedwith this book. Like others have noted, the classification of ""mystery""ought to mean *something.* These stories were...macabre, depressing,lugubrious...I think I'm most mad because they simply weren't ENTERTAINING.Almost all of them were things I just slogged through...Gad. Otto Penzlerand Lawrence Block should hang their heads in shame."
3,Has It's moments,"For the most part Street Snaps is an entertaining dvd which can be very funny in the begining but tends to get repetetive and corny towards the end. The first half hour alone is worth the price of admission but starts to wear thin towards the end, if the second half was as funny as the first, then i would have givin it 5 stars but it's still worth a look."
2,SNAP!,"STREET SNAPS is so weak, when I put the disc in my DVD player, it kept automatically ejecting. STREET SNAPS is so lame, when I went to Amazon . Com to buy it, my account was already credited $9.97 with the satisfaction money back guarantee already refunded. This STREET SNAPS video has way more misses than hits. If you like finding needles in haystacks, there's a few good one-liners here, otherwise most are uninspired and lack true creativity and wit. I'd categorize STREET SNAPS more like your mom, it's better to rent it than it is to own it."
3,She let's you know that she is still a songbird!,"Considering that I've been a fan since 1976, and that so many artists today depend on ""studio magic"", I was quite pleased to hear/know that Niecy is still actively recording. Overall, the synthesized sound doesn't quite capture her abilities as well as her orchestrated albums of the past. However, I totally enjoyed ""Fallen Angel."" The words, music, background vocals, arrangements, and most of all, the feeling....It really moves me in a way that only Niecy can! It's my favorite song of hers since ""The Boy I Left Behind"". A real treasure....."
3,ehhhhhh,"Not an aaaahhhhhhh! Not an uuuuhhhhhhhh! Sort of a ehhhhhhhhh!A complicated plot that barely kept my interest in a story peopled by characters that I barely cared about.Lydia was too terminally perky for me, and Bill too forbearing as he graciously accepted an unending stream of rebuffs from her.I should'a just passed this one by."
4,Solid Massive,"After to listening to both disks, I would say that I am partial to the first disk. Over all I would say it offers very tight mixing. The music is great for the person looking for french influenced global house groove. I am by no means an expert on french house, but with the daft punk samples, and the some female synth type of voices it reminds me of what I consider to be french house."
3,Pretty good...with a caveat.,"The fabric is wonderful...makes my Britax look like a million bucks. But the straps have to be yanked on quite a bit to get them long enough to buckle, almost every time. They slip up between the seat and this cover, and everything has to be shifted a little bit to make it all line up (strap holes, etc.) Still, a nice product."
4,What was that?....Still a quality Figaro.,"I am a great lover of opera, and EMI's new releases seem a good value. I love ""The Marriage of Figaro"", and I jumped to buy this product. I am thoroughly impressed with this production. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf is the best Countess I have ever heard (excepter perhaps Kiri te Kanawa). The only reason that I did not give this production 5 stars was the fact that there is occasional background noise (i.e. clicking, tapping). This recording was made in the 50's, so it may be just old technology coming through. Overall though, this is a great Figaro, and the occasional ""click click"" does not distract from the performance."
4,Has C & E,Very moisturizing but being only 2 oz I find myself running out of it frequently. For the price it doesn't last very long. I use this on top of TNS Serum
5,LOVE IT!,"I have dry skin, and LOVE this moisturizer! After having a laser procedure on my face, my doctor started me on Skin Medica products. He had me using Dermal Repair Cream, but it didn't moisturize my face quite enough. This product, however, does. My favorite out of all moisturizers ever used."
5,These GoGo Boots Are Really Cool!,I have had a pair of these boots for nearly two years and I have not had any problems with mine.They fit fine in the foot and the calves.Mine are the white patent and they are very shiny.The one thing about these is that the white ones show scuff marks a lot.Buy the black and you will not have this problem.I love mine and I am thinking about buying another pair in black patent.These are cool boots that are fun to wear!
1,Very poor quality,"Definitely not worth it. Not only are these boots incredibly cheap/flimsy, there is some ambiguity about which is the left and which is the right foot. They arrived in a very beat-up, dusty box as if they had been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time. I got them on sale and still think they were way overpriced."
3,More than costume,"These boots exceeded expectations because they were listed as a costume boot. They are actually almost good enough to wear beyond the Halloween season. The material is synthetic, almost plastic, but the style is pretty cool. They are comfortable with the square toe and medium heel. I think it is a good buy but you kinda get what you pay for in terms of quality."
2,Meh,"Though cheap and good for minor costume apparel I found these to be very ill fit and lumpy in the heel area, they don't fit tight and seem to sag in large clumps in various areas.Still an effective costume however."
2,Very poor fit.,These boots look nice but the zipper did not move easily and the ankle is unbelievably small/tight. I have really skinny ankles and I could barely zip them. When I called customer service the agent went to get a size larger to compare the ankle area (she wore the same size as me) and she said she couldn't zip them up past her ankle. So unfortunately I have to look elsewhere for gogo boots.
1,Price makes it unaffordable,"For a 200+ pages book, the price is exhorbitantly high which will make it unaffordable to the many millions who want to read it, I for one have heard a lot of praise but unable to buy it. There must be somebody out there, who is either very greedy to make money or believes its counter-productive to his interests and therefore deliberately prohibits it's reach to the masses."
4,"Can't beat Neutrogena for ""chapstick""","My lips chap very easily and I also get fever blisters from wind and sun exposure. I have tried practically every lip protection product out there. There is nothing better than Neutrogena. I prefer the older variety, but they don't seem to make it anymore. The ""Norwegian Formula"" is the replacement. Seems about as good so far, maybe a tiny bit waxier than the original but still better than most. The sun and wind protection seem to be just as great."
5,definite must have!,"Neutrogena lip balm is my hands down favorite lip product for when the weather starts to get cold. I have tried so many other products: Burt's Bees, Carmex, Blistex, SoftLips, Nivea, even good old ChapStick and they ALL dry your lips out even more! I am not really a fan of scented lip products since I'm a chef. Smelling things other than what you are trying to prepare can be a big distraction. Neutrogena's lip balm is unscented and not too gooey, but tangible enough to give your lips comfortable protection. I slather it on heavy at night before going to bed if my lips are really chapped and in the morning wipe off the residue and my lips are back to normal, just like that!"
5,Feels great on!,"I have tried my share of lip balms and have a collection of half used sticks that I might as well just throw away since I now plan to only buy Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula lip balm! It feels great when you put it on and the feeling lasts! I like to apply it before I work out and it lasts through a run or other activity where I will breathe through my mouth. Feels good to finally say good-bye to dry, flaky lips :)I also recommend the hand cream by Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula.. it is a great line!"
5,incredible,"why did I waste years on chapstick?most amazing and works in cold, dry , wet , any condtions.I am fair and 52, love it. love it!"
5,Awesome little lip moisturizer,"I love it! My lips get very cracked in the dry winter time, and I go around with lips bleeding unless I put something on them... but until now, no matter WHAT I put on them, it just didn't last. All the other products I tried didn't last longer than thirty minutes, before my lips started flaking again.This one does the job! Even when my lips are already severely cracked, just put this moisturizer stick on and in a couple of seconds my mouth is free to make whatever shape it wants to. And it lasts longer than other products. A keeper! :)"
2,Breaks apart as I use it,This product seems to crumble and fall apart as I apply it to my lips. I also don't like the fact that the wheel to push the product up is at the top rather than at the bottom as it is on most lip moisturizers. I keep accidentally turning the wheel as I take the top off.
1,horrible!,"this stuff is horrible. do not be fooled, it may be paraban free but it contains OXYBENZONE BENZOPHENONE which is linked to reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, amongst other things. Look up Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer in Cosmetic Database online. I use lip balm daily and this made my lips feel raw, burn and crack! I am going back to the Burts Bees lip balm which uses safer ingredients and does a much better job at moisturizing the lips."
5,only lip balm that works for me,"I love this stuff. Whenever I have cracked lips, I just leave it on overnight and my lips are perfectly moisturized the next morning. It's not overly greasy, and not so watery that it doesn't stay on. It's actually the perfect balance for my preference."
4,"Nice Price, Good Product","Does not cause my sensitive skin an allergic reaction, and doesn't contain a lot of extras that could. Moisturizing doesn't seem to last as long as other products I have enjoyed in the past, but the price on the lip moisturizer is unbeatable."
5,So Smooth!,"I used to have a Chapstick addiction. I was constantly applying and reapplying it. Often, it went on ""chunky,"" and I was picking at it trying to regain a natural look. Neutrogena's lip balm goes on consistently smoothly."
5,"Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer, SPF 15, 0.15 Ounce (Pack of 8)","I have been using this chapstick for many years, it is the only one I use. It's clear, odorless, and not greasy. It stays on, unlike other chapsticks I have used in the past."
5,Belly-Laughs Galore,"Among a host of admirers, Seaton's ""Sayings"" have always created belly-laughs galore. Now a whole new generation will have an opportunity to join in the hilarity. He is a master raconteur who makes his encounters with ordinary citizens and events just as fascinating as his escapades with the dozens of celebrities who have peopled his life and this book. It's a delightful read."
1,The cover art is far better than the movie.,"As a steadfast and perpetually humbled fan of Lynch, Buñuel, and Cronenberg, I was drawn to this film by accolades comparing it to the works of those masters. Though ELEVATOR MOVIE does have the germ of an idea, I am incensed by such comparisons. David Lynch spent five years of his life making his first film, ERASERHEAD. If this sophomoric home movie took five hours I would be surprised.It's so easy to get into the art scene these days. But develop the thought, get a budget, mount a production, and try to hone a work of art through sweat and tears if you are going to call yourself an artist. Please don't try to sell us a sketch on a napkin as anything worthy of being seen by anyone outside of your high school film class."
1,This Is Not A Toy,"Item came in on time, as advertised.You really might want to change the beginning of these Questions(?)These ""Dry Transfers"" are anything but a toy, they take some experience in using."
2,Tiny and Tedious,"I needed these letters for a simple project involving re-naming a few items on a panel. Though I needed the middle range of sizes (1/8""-3/16"") these were very difficult to use. I am a Long time hobbyer and practiced at many crafts; these letters were frustrating and too closely spaced for a reliable transfer without diturbing other letters. I was working with a magnified head set and an appropriate tool. Just touching the film would release some letters ruining them and further frustrating the transfer. Even after the letters are transfered; they are extremely fragile and must be sealed with clear or the like because a simple touch will remove a portion without a doubt. Good luck, they are needful but tedious as I have said."
3,Works OK but not perfect,I was spending a lot of time in my car where there were lots of mosquitoes around and this helped somewhat... They were still around a bit but not in the numbers they had been. Definitely saved me from lots of bites so i feel the product was well worth the price.
4,Fun and educational,"My daughter is now 4 and watches 30 minutes of TV per day. She gets to pick what she wants to watch each time and Team Umizoomi is high on her favorites list.From a parent's perspective, Team Umizoomi provides some basic counting skills and Millie is a good role model for young girls - being on top of things and figuring out what to do next.Yes, I would recommend this DVD to a friend - and my daughter would also!"
5,my son loves it,"A fun and educational show, even younger kids will enjoy it! It has fun songs and teaches about counting, shapes and patterns."
3,Watch out parents,"My three years old son loves Team Umizoomi and can watch them over and over again. I also like all the episodes and think that they are really educational, the characters Milli, Geo and Bot are cute, smart and inspiring. Songs are also very catchy and easy to follow for a 3 years old. However, this particular episode ""Journey to Numberland"" based its story on a wicked wizard who doesn't like numbers. He was casting spells through out the stories and has this scary laughs. It's just not a good theme to expose to little children."
5,Great DVD,"My son thoroughly enjoys this DVD just as he enjoys Team Umizoomi 123 which I had gotten him previously. More DVDs like this one, and I will be a loyal purchaser until my son is too old to watch these!"
5,Keeps the kids quiet know the car!,Recommended for anyone with younger children. We love umizoomi in our home! And it was appreciated by the little ones!!
5,Umizoomi Movie (DVD),Umizoomi is perhaps one of the very few shows on now for younger children that helps to teach math and problem solving. Teaches in a way that children five and under can understand as well as use in everyday life.
1,try another 1st,"this video was NOTHING like the cover. I found it dragging and annoying- Now, I have to try another-should have gone with 1st choice"
2,Jeep Cherokee,"Can't talk to it's rain resistance, but it is very spacious and stout. Only problem I had was that I wasn't able to get a bug tight seal with my hitch in place.EDIT: 9/9/2011I can now speak to it's water resistance, it's not. Will be buying a Coleman or other tent for next years camping trip."
1,unsatitfied,"I used this tent one time and when Itook it down ,One of the top poles broke,.One time used!!!"
4,comment for previous reviewer,"""All About Heat"" is for grades K-4, ""Heat and Chemical Energy"" is for grades 5-8. Not the same DVD. Any series by Schlessinger that is an ""In Action"" series is for older grades(usually 5-8). If the series is a ""For Children"" series, it is for younger grades (usually K-4)."
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices",Title 1 : Heat & Chemical Energy (Energy in Action) (2000)Title 2 : All About Heat (Energy for Children)Same product in multiple prices. Ensure before buy
5,Read this,if you want to have a better understanding of what is going on in northern Africa today. You may have learned in American history that President Jefferson sent the Marines to the Mediterranean when American shipping was being attacked by the Barbary pirates. I attended public schools and was never taught that whites as well as blacks were taken by Muslims and sold in the slave markets. Well written and a very interesting book.
5,Love the product,"This item is just great. I don't have a USB port in my ""old"" car and this works wonderfully. Now, I can listen to my stuff while driving and my family can do the same. Great on long trips and saves time charging or accidentally forgetting the AC charger in the hotel .... great item for charging the electronic items and adapting."
2,not so great,"there are not many things that you can do wrong when designing such a simple device, but this little things still has a major flaw:the roll that automatically pulls in the cable has a very low threshold so it always pulls in the cable. the force is so strong that it even gets pulled out of the cigarette lighter. kind of annoying when driving.putting a knot in the cable fixes the problem."
3,"Good iPod charger, but doesn't work for Moto V365","This charger works very well for my 5.5 gen video iPod (USB), but it doesn't work at all to charge my Motorola V365. It's not the cables or the adapters, because they work fine to carge/connect my Moto when plugged into my Mac. It seems that the charger itself is the incompatible component."
5,BEAUTIFUL AND COMFORTABLE,These boots are way more comfortable than they look. Make sure you order them wide enough as they seem to run narrow: I wear a medium but ordered the E2 size and felt only slightly wider than a medium. Very shiny high gloss leather. Slippery soles so not good on ice or snow. I will try to switch out the laces from the flat cotton to a dressier waxed type.
3,great looking but not very well made,"The title kind of sums up my feeling about these boots. The leather is very thin and I feel that they will not last very long, but they look great and have ZERO break-in time. Coupled with some decent insoles they are easily my most comfortable dress boots. I'm constantly getting complimented on their look, but I wish the leather were a bit sturdier."
5,A stand out,Very stylish shoe. Goes well with almost everything. Women love them. Received many compliments the very first day. When you think Stacy Adams many think old school brand. But this brand has helped to set me apart from the rest.
5,Classic Boots!,I have been wearing SA Madison for years. I am glad I found it on Amazon. The quality and material were not they used to be but I still like it. I just love the style and my wife wants me to wear it on most occasions.I hope they will make it here in the USA someday :)
4,Like them but they definitely run a size too large.,"Love the shoe but they definitely run a size too big. I'm from NZ and I had to send them back for a refund in order to purchase another pair one size smaller. I have somewhat ""wider"" feet then most as well, and they were still too bigAnyone from Aus/New Zealand should purchase a pair one size smaller. Generally speaking any other country too"
2,Squeaky and not like picture,"These boots, expensive boots, squeak so bad it's almost funny. The color is not as dark as the gray appears to be in the picture and they are much narrower on the foot. To top it off, they are very slippery even on carpet.So my boyfriend put these on his wishlist and I got them. When he tried them on a few times these things just kept coming up:-Way too squeaky, noisy-Plastic, light gray looking-Narrow-Way too slipperySo I am returning them :-("
4,Madison Black Boot,"I was very pleased with this selection. The boots were sized perfectly, and fit like a glove. The high gloss finish was a bonus I didn't expect. I've received many compliments from family and friends."
3,Didn't cut it for me,"style: i liked it enough in the pic's and enough in real life. a bit thin / dainty all around for me in the end. white stiches on black leather looked good on the sole. good looking boot overall.construction: laces that come with the boot are too short to tie all the way to the top, though i wouldn't want to lace them all the way up anyway. felt sturdy, but leather is thin and the boot is very light. the sole is what ultimately drove my decision - just too thin. i feel like a boot needs a good wide, thickish base. this sole is just about wide enough, but way to thin. i would put on a better sole myself, but i couldn't justify it with a new pair of shoes.fit: true to length, but the ""D"" size for my completely normal / standard / medium width foot was too tight. i've never had a wide size shoe in my life and would need such a size for this boot.sent them right back for a refund."
2,Very light on details and depth...,"I was disapointed in this book. It largely showcases a few liveries from the 70's to the present. There aren't any of the really old liveries included, and a limited number of airlines -- notable exceptions that jump to mind are American, Northwest, KLM, Cathay (as well as many others).If you're looking for liveries, especially of older airlines that have gone away, merged, etc., this isn't for you."
4,A good read,This book is a good look at the history of airline liveries. It has some of the most non heard of airlines in it. I would say if you like airplanes than this book is for you.
4,"Only 4 ounces, my only gripe. Otherwise awesome product.","This stuff is GREAT. Best sunscreen I've ever used, and I used alot. Non greasy because it uses alcohol as a carrier for the suncreen(that the smell the other reviewer was talking about, duh..) You do have to hurry in putting it on, because it can evaporate if you wait about half a minute."
4,Great stuff if you can tolerate the smell.,"Certainly this is a good value, and I can only hope it's performing as it claims, since there is no way for anyone to ""know"" whether they're getting bombarded with UV rays. This is indeed clear and cooling, but it has a very strong antiseptic/alcohol smell to it which takes a few minutes to go away. My very fair-skinned son doesn't like this stuff on his face for that reason. It works well enough on arms and legs, so we use it there and use the Neutrogena stick form sunscreen on the face."
4,VERY EASY ON THE EYES,"Sublimely rich without being heavy or greasy this light weight eye cream both moistens and tones. It's aroma free and absorbs quickly for makeup application while continuing to hydrate.We've had the best results by patting gently around the eye area both after cleansing the face in the morning and before bedtime.A neat trick to refresh your face and give eyes a dewy appearance is to pat a small amount around eye area over makeup for a quick pick-me-up if you're rushing from the office to dinner. Just a tiny amount does it, banishing that ""crinkly"" look that can appear toward the end of the day."
2,Disappointed!,"The set is gorgeous to look at, and exquisite to the touch. Unfortunately, it is quite fragile. Mine arrived with a major chip in the casserole lid and with several nicks inside the lip of the loaf pan.My wife and I have had our corningware for 25 years - it isn't pretty, but it is durable. I guess we'll stick with it for another 25 years."
4,Satisfied,"These are some of the most beautiful bakeware I have seen. The are very durable, they cook evenly, and they are very unique. They do seem to scratch easily from utinsels or even just being stacked in the drawer. They seem to be prone to little white scratches that come from nowhere, and are impossible to get rid of. They are incredible dishes, but hard to store and keep in pristine condition."
2,Rather Disappointed,Pen doesn't work as fast as I thought it would have. Very slow to upload text to computer. I bought this for a law student and it turns out to be more of a burden to scan and proof the text as you go. If you can type at a decent speed I would strongly discurage purchasing this product for note taking.
3,Super Pen,The pen is slow and fails in about 15% of the intents. I had initial problems with the synchronization with my computer. I received technical help from customer service but the person (male) was disrespectful in tone and attitude.
4,Review of WizCom WSP1000P Line Scaner,"I am using the to take notes for my various on-line and research projects. While the results are about 90% correct, I can usually fill in the blanks, and it is much much better than hand written notes. I would recommend this product to any student or researcher that does not need to take entire pages of verbatim notes. For what I am using it for it is well worth the money."
1,The Pen is Drunk,"I purchased the pen to scan numbers only. That should be simple enough. NOT! The accuracy rate for the pen was about 20%. I could have made better hand written notes drunk. In fact, if the pen acts like a drunk. Not only cannot not copy numbers, just simple numbers, the software staggers like a bar fly constantly missing the stool, but foolish enough not to know it. So my pen, after a generous probationary period and attempts to rehabilitate is being returned to send never to come back to this house again under any circumstance. It is a very bad pen! I truly lost my patience trying to make this work. The designers need to go back to the drawing board sober this time."
1,PACK OF THIEVES!!!,This company is a pack of thieves! The refuse to honor a $140.00 rebate and ripped off hundreds of customers. I was lucky and was able to return this crap to my retailer after wizzcom screwed everyone. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PARASITES!!
3,just alright,this is a good item if you have poor handwriting but take notes from books. Some what difficutlt to operate initially but with practice is helpful if you like to keep track of small passages. Is it worth it. depends on how much you use it.
3,superpen was temporarily awesome,"This product is awesome but was temporary. The first couple of weeks I used the pen, it was like as if there was a dictionary right at my fingertips. All of the sudden, it started not working. It could turn on, but the screen was unreadable because there were black splotches. I have yet to fix the problem. I've had it for a month but it only worked for three weeks."
1,"I wish I had not bought it. So far not working. No return call to help from tech support. Tech support? Zip, none, nada",I wish i had not bought it. Complicated and unwieldy install onto xp machine. Tech support. Could not get thru. Said they would call back.Two days later? Nothing. Lets just says service/support rhymes with buck. Save yourselves! Don't buy this product!
1,Superpen satisfaction review,"The product seams good but instructions on user manual are incomplete and technical support in WizCom Technologies (supplier) has been terrible, now I know why are so many used products of this on sale. I do not recommend the product."
2,"um, who put this together?","What a decidely bizzare combination of bands and songs. We really run the gambit here from big time cheeze metal (Warrant, Slaughter) to corn-ball radio pop (Eddie Money and Loverboy). If you were into hair-metal, you already have these songs (except for the Eddie Money tracks, obviously). If you were into radio-metal/power-pop, went to a couple of Poison shows to oogle Bret Michaels, and all your old tapes were recently stolen from the back of your 1986 Monte Carlo SS, then buy this CD and take heart, CMC is looking out for you!"
5,Karate Woman,I like the Film and the Music.It was super that I get in the U.S.AMany Regard from R.Cavallaro
5,Van Damme,"A great Van Damme double feature, Bloodsport Van Damme's first big movie and Time Cop based on a comic book. Bloodsport is a great fight movie with all kinds of fighting styles. Time Cop is a great science fiction movie about time travel and those who police it."
4,Is that the only way for them to sell Timecop?,"I just wanted to buy Bloodsport, but only found the 2-pack with Timecop. Thanks to South Park, I keep thinking of the quote, ""I don't even want ONE copy of Timecop!"" I have not put it in my player, so I have nothing to say about it, but I'm happy with my purchase because of Bloodsport. While some scenes have not withstood the test of time so well, the fighting remains pretty awesome to watch."
4,A+ in Cheesy Action Blu-ray,"If you like cheesy movies with intense fighting, this is for you. Jean Claude Van Damme is clearly at his best in these digitally-restored versions of the originals, and is a great value. The Blu-ray effects make it that much better.Down-side: Some colors are not as clear as others, but that could be attributed to my TV.However, it was a good buy. If you are a JCVD fan, it's a must."
5,Bloodsport,I like old school! And for me this is it! Since somehow i lost several of my dvds i tried it blue ray i am not to impress but no regrets i like this movie! One of my favorites with me again!
4,BLOOD SPORT / TIME-COP,"If you want ACTION and I mean ACTION, this double disc set is a MUST HAVE. It is all ACTION ACTION!!!"
2,Not for beginners,"This book is good, if you know the Illustrator already or are at least familiar with it. I was brand new to it and couldn't even find a place to begin. Any suggestions?"
4,early 70's pysch-prog hard rock;Great Stuff!,This group was only around for this album when it was released in 1970. These three guys were in their late teens when they recorded this.Excellent guitar! Even the songs are tuneful throughout.This is just as heavy as Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath but with a lean toward prog.Recommended!
5,Clear Blue Sky,"Why all the reviews are rating this album a 3 or 4. This is indeed one of the heaviest albums in 1970. Oh yeah, its not perfectly recorded in a multimillion dollar studio like Zep, Deep Purple or Uriah Heep first albums and does at times have that garage sound at times but just try to find a better faster cleaner lick guitarist than John Simms. I rated this in the top ten albums of 1970 for just being something I'd never heard before, and like Budgie's first, incredible. Prog Rock at it's best and if you love lot's of heavy lead, you won't be cheated and totally blew me away the first time I heard it and still does to this day!"
3,Sludge Rock Also Ran...,"I stumbled onto this CD while searching for something else, and picked it up more out of curiosity than anything else. Hey, it's got a Roger Dean cover, an endorsement of sorts, right? Well... As an interesting bit of nostalgia Clear Blue Sky has its moments, but it's pretty obvious why they didn't cut another album or find themselves a noteworthy spot in the annals of early rock. It's not even so much that they were a bad band, rather that even as a psychedelic/progressive band they come across as ordinary and ever so derivative. Budgie, Blue Cheer, Dust, even Vanilla Fudge to some degree - Clear Blue Sky is an amalgam of these and whatever other bands they were soaking up at the time. If this is your thing, derivative and all, there are any number of bands who pulled off the same thing with results far superior to this pedestrian effort."
3,"Young, quality potential star in the making.","From the first time I heard Thomas George I had that feeling that I was listening to a young work-in-progress. Infectious energy and rhythm, reminding me of early Bob Marley, coupled with clean but passionate vocal lines sold Mr. George as a first-rate, if not yet quite complete, artist, for me. Still derivative - I couldn't help easily hearing 3 or 4 identifiable ""alter-voices"" there, still Mr. George, with just the right soul-searching and practice is on his way to becoming a future star in his own right. Don't hesitate to buy this album - you'll play it every day, as I do."
3,Required some modification,"My aluminum charcoal grill is about 40 years old and it is hard to find replacement grids that fit properly. With some application of copper wire, it was possible to make this one fir and not collapse when it is moved."
3,cute but are you really sure about this?,"This is a cute book. It's funny, it's lighthearted and would make an excellent joke gift. However, if you take this seriously and aren't subtle about implementing it your boyfriend will dump you faster than the time it took you to buy the book. Think about it. What would you do if your guy suddenly announced that he intends to renovate you because he doesn't like your hair, your style or the way you spend your free time? You'd be mad as a hornet, right? Nuff said."
2,"Great photos, lousy advice","This is a gorgeous coffee-table style books overflowing with fabulous photos of interiors. I say interiors rather than homes because it clear that no one could actually survive in any of these ornate, pristine, elegant, and rather stuffy rooms.The ""750 tips"" are given in sidebars, and poor production has allowed that some of the tips are not on the same page as the photo to which they refer. This book also contradicts its own advice - frequently - as when it says to ""always hang pictures 10"" above seating"" accompanied by a lovely photo of a sofa that is backed up directly against framed pictures. Or when they advise not using scatter pillows on chairs or stools, yet this is done throughout the text.750 is a bit of an exageration - they break down ""how to build a fire"" into many small tips, counting each one.Overall, a fairly useless book, but the photos are pretty. A nice gift for the billionaire on your list."
1,Nasty WASP provincialism,"This is horrible little piece of ethnocentric provincialism masquerading as education for parents. If you're the kind of parent who burns your children's rock music because the Christian Right tells you to, you'll love this book. If your worldview is something other than doctrinaire fundamentalist Christianity, you'll want to look elsewhere for an objective overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the New Age movement and modern alternative spirituality in the West.I'm not a New Ager. This is just a bad book for people who think, unless you wanted to use it as an example of a poorly reasoned polemic."
3,for entertainment only,"While this book does make for interesting reading, the author tends to present many outlandish (and proven untrue or at least questionable) anecdotes as facts. This makes the book highly entertaining for those who don't know any better, but serious history buffs will probably be annoyed."
1,Great for your bathroom,"Filled with errors (historical and grammatical), and mediocre at best. Its the equivalent to 16 ten page papers that a undergraduate had to write for history class (or a sensationalist Yahoo! story). It contains very little research but full of opinion. The actual picks of ""most evil"" are questionable at best and her bibliography consists of about 3 sources per chapter (usually encyclopedias).As many other reviews point out, this book is great for a bathroom read, because as a historical work its a piece of crap."
2,Would've been more interesting if...,"...the author was able to tell the reader more about the ""bad cop"", Michael Dowd, than about the ""good cop"". I followed this ongoing NY Post story back in the early 90's and was enthralled by the misdeeds of these men in blue who were first coined ""rogue cops"". However, this book was very repetitive, and bored me at times with the angst of the internal affairs officer. For NYC true crime afficionados only."
2,The website story is much better,"The book is written from the view of the author (a newspaper reporter) and the sole investigator who couldn't catch them. Therefore much of the story is left blank or filled in by the authors vivid imagination. The online story ""Behind The BlueWall Life of NY police officer Kenneth Eurell"" is more detailed from the corrupt officers (Dowd & Eurell) point of views and, gives vivid detail of the crimes involved from an inside look. The book is basically rehashed NY newspaper articles from when the officers were first arrested."
4,Not bad for the price,These were cheap so I bought three so I would have one for each car and an extra. One of them was DOA but the other two have been working fine ever since. I obviously took price into consideration when giving four stars. I would be more inclined to give three and a half stars but that is not an option and if one of these units die I will probably buy two or three more so I rounded up.
5,This book is a MUST READ,"This book must be read by any femme/butch/andro/bisexual/lesbian/trannie woman or boi.It is the ULTIMATE living guide for a femme, and an absolute god send. LOOONG overdue, a book about the funky, fabulous, modern femme diva!"
4,Bubbly and Practical Femme Fun,"I just got this book the other day and I loved it. It's a mix of frothy silliness and practical advice for femmes. Everything from fashion and dating advice to suggestions on how to clean up your house. The book comes across like a long late night chat with a femme diva-y friend. Some will love the style (like me) and others won't. Rednour does chat alot about friends of hers and places where she lives, but since they are used as illustrative examples so it works. I highly reccomend this book for femmes (or those who love us)."
2,Has it moments but unbelievably self absorbed,"There are some funny points in this book but I, unfortunately I was annoyed by the cliquey/self absorbed quality of it. I don't live in San Francisco, and the writer tends to be very wrapped up in her self and scene. It's not really worth paying $14 to read the life story of someone who seems to be living in a bubble and obviously needs desperately to be famous. Yawn."
1,Worthless ...,"This DVD is misnamed. It should be titled ""The Photographers, Mark-up Artists, and Set-up People That Took the Pictures of the Women of Enron"". The entire DVD documnts the photo shoots. If you saw the magazine - you've seen everthing offered in this DVD. Also, the ""extra"" slide show on the DVD consists of two pictures of each woman almost identical to those that appeared in the magazine. Big deal!"
2,Inadequate is the best description,"Claudio Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchesta. You'd think that combination would turn in an outstanding reading of a Bruckner symphony. They didn't. As the Penguin Guide said in the only edition that rated this CD, Abbado was clearly uninspired and the orchestra was on autopilot. Nothing about this CD suggests anything significant about Bruckner or his ambitious First Symphony. My advice is to look elsewhere for satisfaction. In single issue copies, Sieghart, Scrowaczewski and Tintner are all to be preferred. If you're willing to buy a set, the two best versions out there are included in the Karajan and Jochum DG sets."
5,Reference recording,"I will be short on this one, but some of the critics force me to write my opinion: In my ears, this is the best recording of Bruckner's First. I know and owe Jochum (both recordings), Karajan, Skrowaczewski and Wand. But this is the best, in every respect. Period."
4,"Great, friendly book.","This is a man who started a company that gives the client the feeling of having established a real relationship.This book is based off of considerable research, but most of all life experience. I appreciate this company and the man who runs it and pray that God blesses him and his family in the name of Jesus."
5,Where you turn after you've mastered the basics,"If I'm making a tincture and I need to know how much alcohol to herb for a particular herb, I turn to Richo Cech's Making Plant Medicine. If you've never made plant medicine before, you might find the book a bit challenging. The writing is clear and detailed, but it assumes some beginning experience with herbs. If you have the basics and need an herbal formulary that goes into specific detail for several dozen herbs, I know of none better.Susan Lynn Petersonauthor of Western Herbs for Martial Artists and Contact Athletes"
5,Outstanding!,"I found this book at my local library and I fell in love with it. I have been learning to make herbal infused oils, balms, etc. for a couple years now and am always happy to read new information on the subject of herbs and how to use them. This is the best book I have found on the subject! Hands down. It not only has info telling what to use the herbs for, it tells many different ways to prepair the plants for use. Teas, compresses, oils, tinctures, etc. And you don't have to have expensive equiptment to make the products. The instructions, and information are very easy to understand. Richo has a very friendly, open way of writing that makes me feel like I'm learning from a family friend. (Bonus: his daughter draws the cutest little illustrations to open each chapter. So sweet.)I would recommend this book to any person who wants to learn about herbs, for any reason. It is well worth the money and it will be in use at my house for years to come."
3,The trial lawyer as protagonist,"Boies' certainly has some great stories. He reminds me of an old war hero who enjoys conveying the details of distant battles to any willing audience. Perhaps he tries to remain modest, but in the end his ruminations and perceived glory from various legal conquests proves too great a challenge for humility to remain.If you enjoy chronicled biographical thrillers with high cost stakes - this book is for you. However, if you shy away from self-glorifying personas perhaps something a bit toned down would be better?Nonetheless, this is a mesmerizing portrayal of one man's pleasure derived frome litigation conquests. There are sometimes boring people - but there are no boring lives. And Boies proves that with this book."
5,Fascinating and informative for practitioners as well,"As well as providing interesting stories on high profile cases, this book is particularly useful for litigators as a window into how one of the finest trial attorneys thinks and prepares. For example, the section on the Microsoft action details some of Boies principles in conducting depositions, how one might treat witnesses who will not appear at trial differently from those who will, Boies thoughts on weekend breaks in depositions, etc. The trial description detail some ideas on the order of witnesses and provides some insight into what Boies thinks of saving useful documents for recross -- I've read elsewhere that Boies likes betting on the horses, etc. and it's clear from his descriptions, he is very confident about when to take calculated chances during the course of a litigation. It is a very good book."
5,Great Price and Great Perfume,"The rollon version is very handy to put in your purse. The price was inexpensive, and you just need to put a little bit on at the time, and still have the scent on you for pretty much all day. I love the smell, color and presentation!"
2,A Disappointment,"This book has been poorly reviewed by the professional reviewers, and I believe Kathleen Norris has been badly advised by her editor. Perhaps it should have been entitled, ""The Mentorship of KATHLEEN NORRIS, famous author, with biographical notes on her mentor."" That is snottier than I had intended, but it does describe my feelings. I have read Norris' earlier works with great interest and benefit. I have recommended her books and poetry to many privately and in public places, but this book will receive none of that from me. There are at least three good books Norris could have written (a) a thoughtful, creative, but not didactic review of a Bennington education, (b) a coming-of-age memoir up to the time of the writing of ""Dakota"", and (c) a biography of Betty Kray, a person whose life sounds very worthy of a good biography. I give this book two stars out of deep respect for what Norris has meant to me in the past."
4,Was the title picked by someone who had read the book?,"A valuable history of several decades of poetry and ""poetry politics"" in the United States. As many other reviewers have noted, the title has little connection, however, to the contents. This fact was annoying to me, and perhaps detracted from my appreciation of the book's contents."
2,Disappointed,"I have read, reread, recommended, and given as gifts both Dakota and The Cloister Walk. I have seen Kathleen Norris speak. I couldn't wait for her next book, but what a disappointment. It should have been titled How I became Betty Kray or The History of Poetry in the United States. There was little of herself in the book and little of her writing. The historical perspective was interesting, but that was about it. Maybe I missed the big picture, but I don't think so. A quick read--wait for the paperback."
1,Thoroughly Disappointed,I'm a huge fan of Norris and especially love Dakota and The Cloister Walk. I found this book to be boring and I was disappointed in Norris herself much to my own personal dismay. I agree with one viewer's comment that she found her voice in South Dakota.
3,The Virgin of Bennington,"I like Kathleen Norris books and have just about all of them. This one is not one of my favorites, however--it didn't seem to have her usual spiritual insights."
2,Loses momentum,"This is less a memoir than two separate books that don't fit together well as one. The opening section, about Norris' feelings of marginality as she enters Bennington and then later works in New York, are mildly interesting, although lacking in depth. The bulk of the book is about Elizabeth Kray, founder of the Academy of Poets, rather than about Norris. It doesn't work for me at all."
1,The worst movie ever.,"I've seen lots of bad movies in my life. Sometimes these bad movies are kindof fun, like the recent Doomsday; other times they're just horrifyingly lame, like Wing Commander or Dungeons & Dragons; and then there's the epicly bad movies, like Waterworld. But this movie... this movie was worse. It was amazing, watching actors I cared about (Robin Tunney, Angela Bassett) do a fairly good job, and still not save the the movie. The plot, the concepts, the visual effects, the sound mixing - rarely do I even notice this! - they all add up to something worse, and more boring, than one can truly imagine.Worse than Blair Witch 2, than anything by Roger Corman, than... well, anything, period. This movie is one for the ages. Avoid."
1,Terrible Movie,"This movie has some cool effects, but the storyline is terrible. I can't believe theses actors (most of whom have been in better movies) took on these rolls. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Not As Bad As They Say,"I was expecting to see a terrible movie, like Battlefield Earth terrible. But this film was actually well-done. The story was suspenseful and the acting was great. Too bad Robert Forester's role isn't as big as it could have been. First he was in Black Hole, then he's in Supernova. I wonder what solar-related sci-fi film he'll be in next? :)This film is worth checking out. Even after all the negative hype, it's 1 1/2 hrs well-spent."
5,Decent Sci-Fi Romp...,"This movie covers some excellent ground in the realm of Sunshine, Alien, Prometheus, Thing From another World, etc. Much better stuff than most of what is being peddled in the sf/fantasy market (and being called ""good"").It is interesting to me that many of these Sci-Fi suspensers, even when big-budgeted, seem to have a hard time finding their target audience. There are some truly awesome concepts brought up here that are well handled story/plotwise. The fact that very strong actors get to play in this world is also very neat. The effects, for that matter, were much stronger than they needed to be to tell/sell this story. All IMHO."
2,"Some excitement, but not nearly enough.","Though it's an overused plot device, the film does begin in a semi-intriguing fashion, with a medical ship responding to an S.O.S. call. Plus, James Spader makes a likeable hero and Robin Tunney is fairly sexy. Yet, once Peter Facinelli appears the film becomes a bore for the next 50 or so minutes. It isn't until the last half-hour that the film manages to pick up some sign of life and feature something exciting, but it's not enough to salvage the film. For much better sci-fi films, check out Event Horizon, Pitch Black, or Mission to Mars."
2,"Yawn - Good effects, Absent story","The only thing this movie really has to recommend it are the effects and Peter Facinelli's b*lls out performance. You won't recognize him as the confused teen from ""Can't Hardly Wait.""Kinda like ""Sphere"" in that the crew picks up and is menaced by the effects of a strange alien device (can you say, ""2001,"" boy and girls?) There is also a shipboard computer, ""Sweetie,"" that is getting real human feelings. Awww.Angela Bassett doesn't have a role here, but she's very good."
2,typical sci-fi,"this movie is your typical sci-fi box office smash wannabe. though not as bad as the other sci-fi bomb this year,battlefield earth, the actors don't seem to really try with this bad script and even worse dialogue. this does have some good special fx, but not enough for the dead plot. one star for the fx. one star for trying."
4,Cool Sci-Fi movie.,"Even though this movie came out quit a few years ago, it is still very good and the effects are still good. Good for the sci-fi fan in your life..."
1,Uhhh.....what?,"I won't even mention the plot of the movie in my review because I'm not really sure what that plot is. This movie is not just badly written or acted, not that I could tell. This movie is so poorly made I can't figure out if it is poorly acted or written because I could not even follow the picture. It has to set the record for number of cuts per minute, because every second or two the camera angle changes. Everything is chronically underlit, in some scenes where (I guess) important details are being passed the only light is from the instrumentation and dials and things. Nothing was on screen long enough to discern what it was. I didn't even figure out the little chase scene until after I figured out the couple of shots of a woman looking scared and some, uhh....dude (they never said who he was, and he was the big villain of the movie!) looking scary means chase in the Supernova universe. I want my hour and a half back."
1,Oh my. Stinky.,"This movie was bad. Very bad.It's nothing but a contrived, silly plot made up to wrap around lots of T&A;, so that it looks as though it's about more then just an excuse to show lots of T&A.;It plays like a _bad_ late-night Showtime flick, if you catch my drift.The formula has been done many, many, many times before, and so much better (check out _Alien_, perhaps THE best sci-fi deep-space-alien-terror movie ever made. Or to a lesser extent _Sphere_ or _Event Horizon_).I got this for $...out of Wal-Mart's clearence bin, and I regret every penny. I DO NOT reccomend this movie to anyone."
1,This is it!!,"Recently, somebody asked me ""What was the worst film to come out in the year 2000?""Hmmm... I had to think for a minute. I ruled out the standard Roger Corman-esque garbage, I was thinking about films that were ""honest"" attempts at film making with lofty goals but were miserable failures. SuperNova is such a film.Lots of special effects and plenty of senseless violence are the highlights of this lowbrow piece of film. Calling it a work of science fiction is an insult to the genre. Also, the acting was questionable at best, I half expected to see wires sticking out of James Spader's neck since his performance was so wooden. Note to the Special Effects Dept.: ""TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN!"" Glare is not a real nifty special effect.I went to see this garbage at the movie theatre, stupidly believing that it would be good solely based on the hype. Bad idea."
2,I rarely give a bad review...,"I give this movie 2 stars only because it's fun to watch. Otherwise, it's a lame attempt at sci-fi action. ""And now, another pointless scene of explicit nudity"" seems to be the best caption for this movie.The only good things to this movie's name are the special effects, which are among the best I've seen, and Angela Bassett, whose performance is the only hint of acting talent in the film, despite having a usually great performing cast.The ending made little, if any, sense and left you wondering ""so...what happens to Earth?""Final verdict: Ok, if absolutely desperate to see a movie."
2,Where is it?,"This is what happens when you mix sex with science fiction. Well to start off you will know right off at the beginning of the movie that it's going to focus more on sex than on the plot. You'll probably ask yourself at the end of the movie, where is the supernova. I didn't see it, so what's the point of the movie. First this is your typical MGM DVD regardless what the box says, it says ""Stellar special features."" The ""stellar"" features is one theatrical trailer and about ten deleted scenes (very short ones at that). Although the introduction on the dvd is pretty good, like most MGM's. To tell you the truth the dvd isn't worth $20 not even $10. Just stay away from this film. I admit it has some great effects, but just not $20 worth. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS DO NOT MAKE UP FOR THE HORRIBLE PLOT."
2,Abort Mission!,"James Spader really hit the weight room and protein powder for his role in Supernova. You have to hand it to him: He gives his all to even the most mediocre movies.Supernova offers us a familiar story. Intergalactic cruiser receives mysterious distress call from a distant mining colony...should they investigate, or not? Naturally, this is always a no-brainer: Should they not investigate, there would be no movie.They investigate... Naturally, they all come to realize that they should not have answered the distress call. Improbable, and gratuitous relationships are pointedly developed at the expense of original plot or characters. Movie is so muddled and poorly developed, it's no surprise that Walter Hill took his name off it (he goes by his ""nom de dreadful-movie"", Thomas Lee)."
1,SUPER FAILURE ...,"Oh, My ....I like James Spader and Angela Basset. But what were they doing in this crap of a film ? THis faked attempt to do a science-fiction movie is horribel, a real mess, a real candidate to the tittle os worst film of 2000 ( for sure, at least the worst science fiction of 2000 ). The plot and screenplay are awful, but what really surprised me is the incredible poor acting of Spader and Basset. Maybe it was the hand of the director, I don't know ... After ""BATS"", I also hoped that Lou Diamond Philiips would choose better his next jobs, but it seems he wants to stick in B movies definitely."
4,Better than event Horizon,"I starve for sci-fi, and yes there is much to be desired from hollywood. But come on Event was good but why must all sci fi end up turning into stupid horror or religion and not stick to science. More SFX than event, contact, etc great sound, acting WAS good, Spader was great. Change your mind set and relax, If you liked event with its stupid horror this was as good with better SFX. A keeper. Good psycological banter. If you want pure sci fi get Hawkings Universe."
1,BEWARE !! CAUTION !! ACHTUNG !!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!,"Was everyone sleeping during the shooting of this film ? What was the edition guy doing whne time came to do the editing ? Was the director on vacation ?? How the studio permitted this to goe on I cannot explain. This movie is so bad, the screenplay so full of holes, the acting so atrocious, I'm out of words... The ""slowest"" sci-fi movie I've ever watched...."
3,Buff Spader!!!!,"Okay, okay, so the movie [is a little bad], and the dialogue is atrociously stilted.....still, James Spader in full buffed up, muscular mode is worth the cost of the dvd!! I just wish Angela Bassett had lightened up considerably. She seemed so stiff and uncomfortable."
3,Good start but fell flat,"I'm a big fan of sci-fi, but this didn't wet my appetite like I wanted. This movie started out with a very good premise, however it fell short along the way. The special FX were great. The concept of the hyper jump was very original. Basically you have a space hospital on patrol in deep space that picks up a homicidal killer with an alien nuke from a strange moon. So far so good. The only weak links in the cast are Wilson Cruz and Peter Facinelli. The robot had more personality the Cruz did playing Benjamin. James Spader was very different from his ""Star gate"" roll. One flaw was trying to build too much tension too soon. Let the story build. Once again this is a Hollywood showboat of all FX and little story.Over all it was ok, not great, but not total bomb ether."
1,James Spader has done better,"This film was horrible. It was a remake of Alien essentially, just with fewer people to wax, and the bad guy in this one had nowhere near the charm and charisma of H.R. Giger's creation. James Spader has been accepting some pretty horrid roles lately, and this certainly was one of those horrid ones. The story revolves around a starship receiving a distress call, and zooming off to answer it. When the ship reaches its destination, it pick up the guy that sent the distress call, and he basically kills everyone and the movie ends. The characters were all very flaky, and didn't convince the audience that they were worth caring about when they were killed. It seemed to me that the film was rushed into production, seeing as how the plot and script were lacking what I would consider quality. If you want a good space movie look elsewhere, since Supernova should never soil your VCR/DVD Player."
4,A great piece of eye candy,"I really loved this film. I'm a sucker for B-style sci-fi films and am a regular with SciFi Channel flicks like this. Plus, James Spader rocks! While the plot is thin at times, it's a great piece of sci-fi with some good special effects and a neat loner main character. A definite watcher!"
4,Great movie!,"This movie was awesome, 2nd to the best sci-fi movie of year 1999, 1st being Pitch Black. The trailer of this movie was a bit deceiving, after seeing it, it was a lot better then I thought. The special effects was excellent, the story was entertaining and interesting, the characters were good but there wasn't a whole lot of action. This is difinitely a movie worth getting in my collection."
1,Ugh..Terrible!,"If this isn't the worst movie,it's so close to it. It's truly pointless and very confusing because it has no story line. The whole movie almost,except for like 30 minutes in the end,revolves around sex in space. The last 30 minutes were OK but,that is all it was,ok. The rest of the movie was terrible. I went to see it and i wanted to leave after the first 10 minutes but,i stayed thinking ""This is starting out slow and boring but it MUST get better."" an hour passed,it was the same. I do NOT recommend this movie because i would not want others to go through what i did (I.E. almost falling asleep and wasting time.) ~If i could give this movie no stars,i would...~"
3,Orion Paden,"""Supernova"" is one of those movies just like ""Event Horizon,"" leaving the skeptic and curious minded people searching for other intelligent lifeforms that may exist in this big, big huge space that we share. It raises eye brows about the unknown."
1,"Super? Ha, Hardly.","A glowing ball of weird light that turns people evil. A computer in love with its creator. Two people go into a hyperspace pod, one comes out pregnant. Sphere meets Knight Rider meets some bizarre Star Trek episode. Waste of time, unless its late night television, even then, try not to think, or you'll be very disappointed."
1,should be zero stars,"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't know where to begin. I am a regular movie watcher yet somehow this one slipped by me. I was anxious to try out the new amazon unbox to download movies directly to Tivo and this one was on special for 99 cents. Note to self. There's a REALLY, REALLY good reason this was 99 cents. Like I said, quite possibly the worst movie EVER."
2,I must have been on something when I bought this video,"The fact that this film tanked at the box office should have been a warning to me when I was thinking about buying it on video, but being the huge James Spader fan that I am, I just had to buy it, and I must say that I was very disappointed in it. I thought that James Spader and Angela Bassett did a good job with what they had to work with, but in general the plot was so thin and the rest of the acting was so bad that I almost wanted to find a way to tape over it. Spader and Bassett might be Supernova's saving graces, but as far as I'm concerned the rest of this turkey is MST3K material.Alan Smithee, anyone?"
1,"Unbelievable Bad, Not a Redeeming Feature to be Found.","Some Movies Start off good, get boring in the middle and Great towards the end. Some are Great all the way through and Anti-Climatic at the End. ""Supernova"" is Boring at the start, Tedious in the middle and Excruciating at the Climax. It has no up's and down's, it is Constant Cinematic Boredom. How such a Talented cast got roped into this mess is beyond Comprehension, thinking about it has kept me sleepless many a night.You can Definately tell that this movie has been chopped to pieces, at some points it feels as if the director has taken stock footage from other Sci-Fi films and tried to make a Coherent film, he has failed miserably. I'm am getting far too angry, this review is Over."
3,Seen it all before...,"Not really very much to say about this movie. It's all been done before in one form or another, crippled ship in distant part of the Galaxy picks up lone survivor who is not what he seems. The acting is ok from all quarters and the visual/audio special effects are above average. However, mid-way through the film its quite apparent there isn't anywhere for it to go and the ending is very predictable on the whole. The dvd offers the usual extras including an alternate ending thats almost identical to the one in the movie. My advice, try before you buy."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This movie is horrible. I hated every minute of it. Being an avid science fiction fan i had high hopes for this film, but was horribly let down. Skip this one altogether."
1,supernova,"i have been trying to watch this movie for 4 days. i have found it to be very ""BORING"". save your money. not worth buying.i would rather be defrosting the freezer"
1,AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE,"PLEASE use the hour and a half of your day doing ANYTHING else than watching this movie. Most of my DVD's are in the science fiction category and I decided to purchase this one just because I wanted to see it when it was in the movies, but I never had the chance. I went into this movie with the utmost confidence that it would be good. I was looking forward to a Supernova (the title of the movie after all) and I barely got a Nova.This movie insults your intelligence. Don't get sucked in with the advertisements on the 20 extra minutes of deleted scenes.DON'T BUY OR EVEN RENT THIS MOVIE. Pretend it was never made!"
4,Super-Hot,"The fireworks between James Spader and Angela Bassett is what makes this film worth seeing. The movie is unfortunately an hour and a half due the horrendous deleting of much of the film. The story is unusual and keeps you interested, but the too short length of this motion picture leaves you wanting more! Especially since this feature was originally slated to be over two hours long! I am holding out hope that MGM (which destroyed this flick) will get its act together and release the ENTIRE film on disc! The sound effects and a spectacular ending make this a film to get. Stick to the DVD (R rated) and please ignore the other version."
5,Awesome music,Iloved this music. This basically is all you need for a Mission: Impossible Soundtrack because all you need is the theme music.
2,Another sampler?,"I think Scorpions are the band with the most samplers in rock history! Why another one? OK, the songs are ofcourse good, but this is an 'no-need' release. Believe me, I am a big fan... Two stars, because the songs are ok."
1,This set was created to take advantage of innocent zombie fans,"The product combines the REMAKE of Dawn of the Dead with the Romero ORIGINAL Land of the Dead. Chances are, you love one and hate the other. Add the fact that you can buy (the same versions of) both movies for less, and there is no good reason for this product to exist--other than to trick people.For example, the video preview on the product page (as I write) is of the original Dawn of the Dead, which is NOT a part of this set. It's disgusting deceptive marketing. The producers of this product must believe their customers are brain dead!If you don't read the package carefully and know which versions you are getting, you will be disappointed. The movies individually would rate more stars, but the set should receive less than zero stars. In fact, if you're a purist, you'll recognize that this set represents what Romero was mocking in the original Dawn of the Dead!Don't soil your shoes by stepping in this thick irony."
3,Be careful when ordering...,"I guess I didn't read the description closely enough, but I thought I was getting both movies from Romero and it turns out that the Dawn of the Dead is the recent remake and not the Romero version at all, so be careful when ordering these multi-packs."
5,My Son Just LOVED the Zombie Double Feature Movies,"My son requested this movie. Since it is somewhat hard to find, I ordered through Amazon. The movies arrived quickly and in perfect condition. My son is just THRILLED and; thus, so am I."
4,Good collection of Deborah's music,"Deborah Harry has released four solo albums during her career: KooKoo - 1981, Rockbird - 1986, Def Dumb & Blonde - 1989, and Debravation - 1993. This collection is very good, but her solo albums have been so-so, which cannot be helped. My two favorite ones are Rockbird and Def Dumb & Blonde, but I don't really love Debravation; it had about three songs that I really enjoyed, so I sometimes skip the tracks included from that album on Most of All. Her style strays from Blondie's work, so you may more or less love this collection if you're a fan of the band. However, I would suggest this to a collector or for someone who just wants a greatest hits compilation, and not the regular albums."
5,With-held Major Damage,"These fishnets are amazing, I just use them for carnival. This year my costume had lots and lots of dangling gems and diamantes and I knew dance tights would be shredded by them so I decided to try these. Now let me tell you, many times through out the day my gems/diamantes got stuck to the fishnet and I pulled them out with ease with not a tear or ladder in sight. They didnt feel cheap and were well made, extremely stretchy and comfortable.Will be using them again next year"
5,Top of the Line Fishnets,"Love these because they have a solid piece of fabric underfoot, so that the wearer is stepping on a smooth, soft surface. I pull the smooth piece of fabric forward and up to cover my toes. That way, my toes aren't poking through the holes of the fishnets as happens with every other brand that I have tried. These are professional and they last and last. You will not find a more comfortable, well made, classic pair of fishnets."
3,They are Fine,"I got these for a halloween costume (slutty cop). They are ok, I was really expecting them to be more comfortable in the foot area based on the reviews I read (that they aren't mesh under foot). But the non mesh foot bottom is too small and you end up standing on seams because the smooth bottom is only a certain size, like a size 6 or something and this part doesn't stretch well. I wear size 9. Now the mesh part was pretty thick and way nicer quality that the costume types at the halloween shops."
4,Love at Sweet Valley,"Love is in the air at Sweet Valley Middle School, and Peter Burns has a crush on Mary Wallace. The snobby Unicorn Club decides to make up a love potion to sell at the school carnival, to feed the fires of Peter's crush on Mary. It's rather entertaining. And, as usual, it shows the strong bond between two great twin sisters."
3,Sloppy phrase book,"The type is really tiny. The devanagari type is very hard to read. This poses a problem since it is quite difficult to derive accurate pronunciation from Hindi transliterated into Roman script. The Hindi words are sloppy looking, too, besides being small.The numbering system is helpful when using the index/glossary but page numbers would have been sufficient."
3,Good Content - Bad Binding,"I've just started using the book. So far, the content seems good. But contrary to the claim on the cover (""Sturdy binding - pages will not fall out""), the pages are already starting to fall out. Not good for a book that's going to be opened a lot."
2,Not worth if you are studying Hindi,"I am learning Hindi, and I threw this book to the recycle bin in less than a week. If you are just going for a trip to India and want to say few sentences you could do with it, but it is definitely not a book for Hindi students."
2,Say It in Hindi,The book would be very handy for the novice however our copy arrived too late for our trip(7 days after departure) so I would not order from that book seller again.
2,Limited usefulness for people on a short time budget,"I was disappointed in the book. There is a lot of information in it, but the author explains some of the pronunciation in terms of how you speak French, which did not help me much. The pronunciation guide is in a modified phonetic spelling which may be understood by linguists, but which was not terribly user friendly to a layman traveler who had time to study the language only very briefly before arriving in India. This was not the ""down and dirty"" survival phrase book I had hoped for. Lastly, being a 1981 publication, it does not really reflect all of the English jargon now incorporated in the language."
4,A more serious Godzilla,"Preparing to end the first series, the Showa's, Toho brought a more serious tone back to a series that had gone camp and introduced what was the Big Guy's most powerfull foe to date - Mechagodzilla-1 and it's alian masters. The packaging was well done and it's a clean print. It's also a bargain for collectors and casual watchers a well, just remember that it has a direct sequel - Terror of Mechagodzilla."
5,This movie is crazy. I love it.,"Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla is certainly the most entertaining Godzilla movie I've seen so far. The plot is outlandish: Some ape-like aliens have created a mechanic copy of Godzilla to help them conquer Earth. A princess is having visions about monsters trying to destroy Earth, and it all ties into some ancient prophecy, also involving a third monster, King Caesar, who is awakened by a song (sung by said princess)!The movie keeps getting weirder and weirder as it goes along and it's all very, very entertaining. The soundtrack music seems completely out of place most of the time but just adds to the absurdity of it all. Certainly a must-see movie for fans of monster movies or just crazy movies in general!"
5,Godzilla; The early years,"This was a great buy and it got me one step closer to completing my collection. Amazon.com has helped me to locate many hard to find items I have been searching for over many years. I bought this dics used and by the way it is in mint condition. I have since recommended amazon to many friends and family members and will continue to do so, Happy shopping."
3,Godzilla again,"I thought that this was an okay movie, not really one that I would want to watch over and over again. Maybe if King Seasa, Seasar, Seesaw, Shisa, whatever, had played a bigger role it would have interested me more. Does anyone get the whole play on Okinawa thing going on? He is a Shisa, one of those lion-dog palace guardians. So it is interesting that the person who can awaken him is the last descendant of the royal family. The Shisa in Okinawan belief can swallow evil, so it is appropriate that King See-Saw (when I was younger I thought it was spelled this way!!) can take in the energy rays from MechaGodzilla and shot them back. Overall, too weird of a movie to watch too many times. Maybe I'll get it again just to learn the King See-Saw song. Does anyone know that one!?"
5,Spectacular Video Quality,"I'd have to say I've never seen this movie as clearly as it's presented on this DVD. The opening Anguirus scene, which always seemed to me to be murky, is very clear. Sony for some reason also decided to change the Toho logo to the new version, but it makes no difference overall. I recommend this DVD to all Godzilla and kaiju fans."
2,"okay, that's about it",godzilla battles his mechincal twin in this outting. It's fair but not one of my favorites. godzilla is kinda boring this time around. he didn't do very much against mechagodzilla accept use magnetic powers to defeat the monster. I reccomend the 1994 version. godzilla does more damage in that movie.
2,BOREING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, I'M 11 YEARS OLD AND I DON'T KNOW JACK ABOUT MOVIES. BUT I'M A SERIOS GODZILLA FAN AND I KNOW A GOOD G MOVIE WHEN I SEE ONE. AND THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. SO ALIENS WANT TO CONQUER THE EARTH WITH A GODZILLA WANA'BEE MACHIEN, BUT WHY A GODZILLA LOOK ALIKE WHY NOT GHIDORA (EVEN THOUGH MECHA GHIDORA WASN'T MADE TILL 1991.)AND HAVING THE MONSTER KING SEESAR IN THE MOVIE WAS POINTLESS,BUT I'LL GIVE IT SOME CREDIT,BECAUSE...WELL,YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE THE END OF IT.(HINT:LOTS OF BLOOD)"
2,The movie is ok....,"It is okay. It has a pretyyyy bad plot. Godzila has an friend, the God that looks like a god. King Caesar is his name. it is better than Godzilla vs. Megalon. The effects are good. The movie has it's moments. I reccomend this if you like the monster Mechagodzilla."
4,Good Action,"The first MechaGodzilla movie was a much different movie than ""Godzilla vs. Megalon."" This movie definitely had a lot of good fight scenes and the special effects were top notch for that time. I must admit that they could've left King Ceasar in that mountain because he definitely didn't help Godzilla in the least bit. It had it's cheesy moments, but this movie was quite entertaining. I recommend kids and adults to watch this movie."
2,Great scenes spread apart by too much boredom,"The scenes with the monsters are great, but just too far inbetween. This movie just drags and drags at times. But, the fight scene at the end with Mechagodzilla is worth the wait, although the idea of Godzilla just ""magnetizing"" himself was a bit much."
3,"A step in the right direction, but only one step.","This movie is an improvement over its predecessor, the dreadful ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"", which isn't saying much...frankly, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" would've been an improvement over ""Godzilla vs. Megalon""! Nevertheless, the creation of Godzilla's robotic double is an inspired one, even if Godzilla himself still looks vaguely frog-like and the SFX still aren't up to the standard of those spoiled by the Tsubaraya years. I mean, come on...the ape masks of the aliens are positively pathetic, let's face facts! Thankfully the next sequel, ""MechaGodzilla's Revenge"" (""The Terror Of MechaGodzilla"" here in the States) is another step up, albeit a bit too late to save the original series. Bottom line: this is a fairly entertaining movie that unfortunately doesn't follow through in many places that it should."
4,GODZILLA VERSUS MECHAGODZILLA,"This is another one of my favorites from Toho's original series. The evil space invaders plot, which has been used too many times and is usually very weak, is actually a good idea in this adventure. In order to conquer earth, the apelike Simeons use MechaGodzilla, a robotic duplica of Godzilla. When Godzilla is defeated by his metal clone, MechaGodzilla goes on another rampage. Meanwhile a group of humans are trying to destroy the Simeons base in order to stop MechaGodzilla. When MechaGodzilla is sent to destroy the Azumi palace, a girl summons the lionlike King Seesar to battle the robot. Before long, Godzilla returns and the two of them destroy MechaGodzilla and save the world in an impressive battle. Highly reccommended for anyone!"
3,The original MechaGodzilla is an inspired idea.,"While not the greatest of Godzilla films, this is certainly a step up from its predecessor, ""Godzilla vs. Megalon""...then again, a documentary about fungus would have been a step up from ""Godzilla vs. Megalon""! The idea of a robotic twin for Godzilla is at once outlandish and clever...it takes the aura of invincibility of the original Godzilla, and intertwines it with the fascination and trepidation that super-technology brings. Make no mistake, this is by no means a gem, but it does show some new thinking going on at Toho at the time, even if the budgets were just a BIT constrained."
4,"Great special effects, godzilla as you've never seen before!","It is well worth watching just to see Godzilla pit his radioactive fire breath against Mechagodzilla's eye laser/particle beams. As it may seem that in this one Godzilla has finally met his match, Godzilla shows a few new tricks whereby he transforms himself to become ultra-magnetically charged, drawing Mechagodzilla into his grasp, and thereby tearing him to pieces. Great stuff!"
4,This movie is COOL!,"While not as good as the hesei films(Godzilla 1985-Godzilla vs. Destoroyah), this movie towers over others like Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster & Godzilla vs. Megalon."
3,"Big Bertha - 'Live In Hamburg, 1970' (Majestic)","This odd 2-CD release of an early Cozy Powell band was recorded by a couple of fans who attended this show that apparently took place at a small club near Hamburg, Germany on Decemeber 3, 1970. Sound quality isn't great - but it's quite acceptable I thought. Tunes I liked best were ""Dave's Idiot Dance"", the nine-minute ""She's Not There"", the rocking ""The Stumble"" and the awesome twenty-minute ""Rhapsody In Blue"". Personnel: Dave Ball - guitar & vocals, Denny Ball - bass & vocals and Cozy Powell - drums. Basically, it's powerful blues rock - much in the vein of Led Zeppelin, Free and Cream. Look at the low asking price."
1,"ouch.....low wattage ""power trio""....","Cozy Powell was a UK drummer of fine repute who played with many bands as well as his own solo projects. Early exposure for him came from his drum oriented ""Sandy Nelson like"" 45 rpm ""Dance With the Devil."" Worth seeking out. Doesn't appear here! This is a poorly recorded (very muffled vocals) derivitavely performed live effort by Cozy and the Ball Brothers (on bass and guitar) hardly warranting 2 CD's. Classifiable as ""poor man's Cream."" A snarly punk approach to the great Zombies classic ""She's Not There,"" almost always done wonderfully by anyone else who tackles it. There are some nice throbbing basslines in here but otherwise, its best spots are merely pedestrian."
4,Ever so Haunting,"I wind up finding the best music when I'm overseas. Stuck in a Paris hotel on a rainy day, the video for'On The Radio' kept playing. I felt it immediately - ran out to buy his cd but unfortunately it hadn't come out yet. Had to wait two months in the states to get a copy - and I love just about every track.'Kate' is one I can't stop playing, so haunting, yet so heartfelt. Jay-Jay's voice is just in a catorgory of it's own.Come to find out that he's on another cd I loved 'Queer as Folk, First Season Soundtrack' with 'Suffering'-another haunting track. After listening to his cd, it clicked for me - same voice, same style.Get this albumn, you won't be dissapointed."
3,"If you dont play poker, please give this book a pass","Being a Chinese trader who's ignorant about poker, I could only complete the first few chapters and put it down. The large amount of poker jargon and geographical name just stopped me from reading onwards. In fact, this review is written with the sole purpose to warn fellow trader reader that this book is for those with definite knowledge and interest in poker. If you dont play poker at all, I strongly suggest you to give this a pass."
3,the last thing we needed,"I agree with the reviewer who called this book a grave disappointment. 10 years ago, when the concepts of poker were not very widely known, a book detailing their application and transferability on Wall Street would not have been a big deal. But now that there are possibly as many as 100,000 people who have reached a level of conceptual expertise that would have been called ""expert"" five years ago, the last thing we need is them all opening up a futures account. The pie is large, but not so large that it can stand being divided up by poker-player type numbers. These concepts would have been better left at the poker table. Beyond that, it's an okay book. Okay, it's a decent book, I'm just worried what it will mean for some of the established participants will probably have to compete with an influx of young talent, and this unique book doesn't help. Couldn't the author have just written another stock-pickers book? Those sell better, and no one gets harmed."
5,Enlightening and Entertaining,"I'm an investment professional with a casual interest in poker, but have never played at the level (stakes, skill) described by the authors. While I can't speak to the book's value to players seeking to improve their outcomes at the poker table, this book should nonetheless be of real interest to many on Wall Street and others who are interested in learning how the spheres of poker and investing overlap. It's well-written, a fun read and provides lots of fascinating anecdotes."
2,too much rambling,"I am a serious poker player and am well read in finance (CFA), so i assumed the book would be a natural fit for my interests. However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who said ""the book is confused"" and the author's ""editor did not reign him in properly"". It feels like the author is just rambling on without a specific point or idea. It covers too many topics (off the top of my head: hand values, poker history, put-call parity, utility curves, psychology, horse races, society and wealth, then he adds some personal stories). All those topics may have been feasible if they were weaved together better. Unfortunately, he covers some topics superficially and some in painstaking detail. Some areas are written for an audience unfamiliar with poker/finance, then other areas dive into advanced nuances. The book is just not edited well enough to be a satisfying read."
4,Beyond Game Theory,"In this book, Aaron Brown illustrates why the probabilistic and game theoretic considerations that are often touted as the foundation of poker theory, have in fact severe limitations when predicting or even explaining actual play.Similar problems surface when applying game theory or utility theory to predict the decisions of economic agents, for example in the context of financial markets. This is exactly the link between poker and finance and it is also the reason why poker is very different from other casino games.Brown illuminates the market microstructure of the poker table by analyzing table dynamics and player strategies and he demonstrates how to successfully find and exploit temporary inefficiencies in the micro economy of the poker table.Overall, this is a valuable book for serious poker players."
4,Game on----,"As a professional in the ETF business I highly recommend this book. Let's face it....Game theory is here to stay and Aaron's book details this very well. If you're planning on entering into the business of investments from Algorithms to Zeta Models....do yourself a favor and read this book... Aaron Brown's ""The Poker Face of Wall Street"" takes a dry subject matter and makes it fun and enjoyable. I'd like to see Aaron take on the boys from Susquehanna in a lil' five card. Game on-----"
5,Lessons for Life,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, other than obviously something about poker and something about finance. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Brown weaves lessons in poker, finance, and economic history into a very entertaining and educational read. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of his analysis of other betting games and schemes.Brown has lived these worlds, so his views are extremely credible.This should be required reading for MBAs, as it packs more practical wisdom in its 300+ pages than a few semesters of courses."
1,Very basic,"To sum up the book: if you have a bad hand, fold (stop out) and if you have a good hand, bet big."
2,Doesn't really work.,"Even after carefully following a recipe (Ben and Jerry""s Mocha Heath bar I still had tasty cream soup but nothing frozen. A big disappointment. Had to send it back."
5,Two is better than One,I bought this for a Father's day gift for my dad. My mom was so happy that I did. She likes that the original bowl is black so that she can tell when she puts one back in the freezer which one to use next. They practically make ice cream every day and you have to freeze the bowls at least 24 hours or they don't make the ice cream hard enough. So if they do use them every day she can tell that she used the silver one Tuesday so Wednesday she will use the black one. I will definately order one for myself now!
1,excellent item - WAY over-priced,"just bought the Cuisinart Pure indulgence ice cream maker at Sam's for 49.00 - don't understand why freezer bowl by itself is sooooo expensive. Most people will want an extra freezer bowl, cause it takes 6 - 8 hours for bowl to freeze properly, and if you are having a party, you would definitely need more than two quarts!"
2,Where's the ice cream?,"This Cuisinart ice cream maker sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, even though I followed the directions precisely, what I got was not ice cream...not even close. It never thickened. It tasted good (we drank it), but it was not what I wanted. I would like to know if I did something wrong, but as I said, I followed directions."
1,Deceptive Labeling: This is NOT a stainless steel bowl,"Maybe like some of you who are reading these reviews, I have been looking for an ice cream maker that has a freezer bowl that is not coated or made of aluminum. Amazon and many other vendors list this item as a stainless steel bowl, but I guess that only refers to the color. I wrote to Cuisinart (ConAir) asking about this replacement bowl and the bowl in the original ice cream maker, and this is what they wrote back: ""The ice cream maker bowl is aluminum coated with Xylan (polypropylene) non-stick. The ICE-RFB is the same bowl made with the same material."" So please be aware that this bowl is not suitable for anyone seeking to avoid petroleum-based coatings and aluminum food containers."
3,Cuisinart bowl,"Item seems well made for Made In China but not too certain about its durability. Identical to bowl in original machine package.One concern is price, about 1/2 of original cost for the entire unit, and that was a Today's Deal. I'm not sure I would pay the full non-sale price. Have yet to use it, in freezer now waiting its chance.Note to Cuisinart, I would be happy to pay a little more for your products, and buy more products, if you would return manufacturing and jobs to America. Amazon should list country of origin on all products."
5,Extra Freezer bowl = A MUST have,Having an extra freezer bowl stored in your freezer makes ice cream making easy. Great for parties when you need more than two quarts of ice cream. Great when you want to make two flavors of ice cream or make ice cream on two consecutive days. The extra money is well spent.
1,worthless,This book is one of the worst for preparing for the A+ invest in TIA CREF recommended books instead.
2,"Good review book, but a lot of the material is out of date","This book is a good review guide for the A+ exams, however a lot of the material in it is out of date."
4,The Writings of the Quill,"The book of plays is able to engross readers with its clever and chilling turns. Doug Wright's disturbing work is written beautifully, and will leave the reader thinking."
1,Faulty Product,"The item looked great, but did not function. Batteries were charged and installed correctly, but product did not work. This product was from Hobbytron. They do not respond to my e-mails or phone calls. I am very disappointed in the customer service."
1,Child's Apron -- basically used for pattern!,"Disappointed in how flimsy the apron is. I ended up using it for a pattern to make a much nicer apron. Nice pattern, but kind of expensive if that is all to use it for."
4,This will hold your interest,I have recently discovered Julie Miller's suspense novels and am enjoying working my way through them. This one is just the right mix of suspense and romance. I enjoyed reading of the characters' plight and how it was resolved.I would recommend this book to a friend.
1,Not very helpful,"Firstly, this spiral-bound book is such an odd shape it doesn't readilty fit a bookshelf. Secondly the diagrams are too small to have any use to anyone not already familiar with the engines. It might be a good, quick refresher for those already knowledgable, but useless for those not. The text is not very good (of what use is it to know that the inventor of the Stirling engine was an engineer, not a minister?) and coupled with diagrams that do not permit us to figure out how the mechanisms operate is not a good combo. We also need a glass to read the tiny equations and it is simply not possible to make sense of the mechanical drawingsl"
1,lopster pot,I do not recommend this pot. The product is very cheaply made. It arrived with some of the finish already scratched off. I returned it for a full refund.
3,CornFused Here...,"I recently purchased the 55-200mm lens from Ritz via Amazon. I did not get this lens hood, instead I got the HB-37. Now, I'm not sure what the real difference is. Can anyone explain?I've taken photos with and without it, and really don't see the purpose of it. Now, I just don't use it at all, takes less time to fiddle with while out in the field. Do I need it and why?"
1,Amazon poor marketing,"This was a very disappointing purchase for me. Due to Amazon's poor marketing, they offered this lens cover along with the Nikkor 55-200mm lens for an additional price. Well, the lens came with this hood. So essentially I just paid to ship it to my house and back to Amazon, approximately $15? The product seems okay but be wary of Amazon's ""good buys."""
1,Disappointed in the waste,Bought this for my Nikon D3000 after seeing an Amazon suggestion for it but I have never used it because it does not fit the lens. Big waste of money. I'm regretting not getting a Canon.
3,"Does the job fine, but DON'T BUY IT FOR THE 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX!","Okay, this lens hood is fine. Terrific.BUT...the 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX COMES WITH THIS ITEM! Don't ""take advantage"" of Amazon's ""Better Together"" offer for the lens:""Buy this item with Nikon HB-34 Lens Hood for 55-200mm DX Nikkor Lens by Nikon today!""Because then you'll own TWO of these."
4,Well Pleased,"I was a bit skeptical when replacing my solid hood for a scalloped one, but this is exactly what the lens doctor ordered. Not only is it just a touch lighter than my old one (a consideration for long shoots)but it fits snugly on my 55-200 mm Nikkor lens. The scallops make it easier to remove/replace the lens cap but it still cuts out the 'trash light' when shooting in low light city shots or sun glare. I heartily recomend this as a replacement/additional hood."
5,Fantastic,Well it is Nikon so it has to be quality. I tried a knock-off version before that would not stay on. This one works perfect.
3,Very pointless,"I bought this lens hood to protect the kit lens that came with my camera. It adds a few inches and makes the lens a bit more professional looking. As for being a good hood, it does its job and which for me mostly is protecting the lens from hitting on stuff."
4,Nikon HB-34 Lens Hood,Its a lense hood for a 55-200mm af lense. Its plastic and made well. How much can you say about a lense hood.
4,Redundant,"Lens came with a hood from Nikon. This one is ""extra."" It never hurts to have a spare especially when it is detachable and prone to getting lost."
5,NIN essentials,"I've said it before and I'll say it again - Trent Reznor is one of the masters of the remix. If Broken is the exact opposite of Pretty Hate Machine, Fixed is the opposite of Broken. I guess that's why he picked those names. I think Trent really likes the songs Wish and Happiness and Slavery, since he has two versions of each song. For Wish, there's a remix of Wish and Fist F_ck, which, if you listen towards the end, there's a sampling from a TV commercial, both really good remixes. For Happiness and Slavery, there's happiness in slavery, and Screaming Slave, both very different mixes. Screaming Slave sounds like he or someone is being tortured. Then there's a mix of Gave Up and a mix of Last (Throw This Away), my personal favorite off of Broken. Any NIN fan needs to have both Broken and Fixed in their collection, along with the Fragile, Downward Spiral, and Pretty Hate Machine."
4,A Great FPS soundtrack,"I use this CD for some of the first-person shooter games I play, and it really adds some zest. The only CD I like using for those games more is Danny Elfman's soundtrack for Pee-Wee's Big Adventure."
2,Hmmm.........,"Well, It's not worth the money that they want. I bought it at a music store for like 7 bucks. It is not very good compared to any of their other albums, even the Perfect Drug Remixes. However, its still Nine Inch Nails, and still cool. For those die hard fans like myself, I would recommend it. For those of you who liked their major albums, stick to those albums, you probably won't like this."
3,long and hard,"this album's great when in a mood for some serious noise; but the sound is very hard and chaotic. this limits the play time on my stereo anyways. there are some elements of the remixes that i like quite a bit, though. it's hard to say which album i like more between this one and broken. for increased replay, go with pretty hate machine or further down the spiral."
3,Nine Inch Nails - Fixed,"This is not a bad release by any means, but I still definitely prefer Broken. These remixes cross the lines between being genuinely interesting reinterpretations, and downright annoying tracks of noise. I found myself checking the CD player several times to make sure the CD wasn't skipping, yes, some of the tracks actually sound like that. Overall I enjoyed this release, and especially enjoyed seeing Coil get into the mix, but I really can not recommend this to casual Nine Inch Nails listeners. This release is more for people into their experimental side, or more into industrial noise."
3,"good band, different style,a turning point.","the new c.d. is very different from other nin albums,it may not be liked by most of trent's fans."
3,the major album then the remix cd,The remixes of the popular songs are very good. But some of this CD is just a collection of strange noises. Usually the more organized strange noises are the best. Sreaming Slave remix has to be the best song on here. Much darker then the origional. Wouldn't advise this one for everyone. But for the halo collector it's a must.
5,best remixes ever made!,"i don't care what others say. It's got techno and anger builded with each other. Description sounds like Broken and Pretty Hate Machine match. Actually sort of.The Gave Up remix is pretty cool, though you probably won't like it the first time you hear it. And if you like NIN, you like this. Then the two Wish remixes. First one is pretty cool. The second one (Fist F**k) is very loud, keeping the bass in Wish there. It also contains two of Happiness In Slavery. None of them sound a thing like the original. But there cool anyways. Then it has the Last remix (Throw This Away) which is also cool.Personally, my favorite of the remixes. Even though only two tracks done by NIN.Other artists: Coil, Jim Thirwell, more."
1,The Most Horrible Thing Nine Inch Nails Ever Did,"I'm sick of hearing people talk about how brilliant this is because of how it totally molested the original genius behind Broken. And I'm getting REALLY sick of people saying Trent Reznor can do no wrong. I'll admit that I'm a Nine Inch Nails collector, if not a fanatic, but I can't fathom lying to people by telling them that this is good. Trent, what in god's name were you thinking? This sounds like random machinery malfunctioning with a few screams thrown in. Now I can completely relate to the screams of pain, as I can't help but do that myself after listening to this for a minute, but this is just awful noise. There is nothing distinguishable about anything on this album aside from the fact that it's horrible, please don't ever buy this, Trent should not be getting money for making this so let's not give it to him. AVOID"
1,Fixed? That's a lie,"I'm really dissapointed in this remix cd, I love NIN and Broken was a great EP. But they remixed them a little TOO well. A really good example is the last song ""Screaming Slave?"" what the heck is the point of listening to 6 mintues of hearing someone yell in pain? It's boring!"
2,basically hate it...but it'll grow on me i imagine,"there's a couple of songs that are ok on here ... but there not the kind you can listen to all the time like, say, the downward spiral, pretty hate machine, broken or the fragile.......im sure eventually i might like it more....ive only listened to it a couple times since ive had it and i always have the urge to turn it off....usually i would take a cd i dont like to the pawn shop but since this is nine inch nails i have to keep it for my most TREASURED collection.....so basically...get this if you are a severe nine inch nails halo-ist....(but it most likely wont be on repeat in your stereo)"
5,Fixed indeed,"The original soundtrack broken was an incredible feat with a 6 great songs and an extensive amount of 1 second songs encouraging the title broken, Unfortunatly not as many people enjoyed the 99 tracks so if you want all the songs very well remixed, less soudless tracks, and remixed songs in some cases better then the original.. fixed won't let you down"
3,"If it ain't broken, DON'T FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!","I didn't care for this one at first, but then I listened to ""Further Down The Spiral"" and was totally misled. At least this remix album has somewhat of a direction. For the most part, I dug the first 4 cuts. The last 2 inspired me to rate this one at 3 stars. As for most people who didn't aknowledged the statement on the back of the cd, it says: Contains various interpretations from the ""Broken"" EP."
3,Original,"This album is by far NIN's furthest deviation from their norm. Most of the songs are indeciferable from the originals, but that is not necessarily a negative aspect of this album. Approach the listening of this album with an open mind to new concepts and it will be a pleasant listening experience."
3,Just too different,"It is ironic... It almost seems as if this is the broken CD. The remixes here are like abstract versions of the original. Unfortunately, I think it is a little too far. At the same time there is some magnetism that makes me want to listen to the cd and the uniqueness and differences from Broken make it a good listen."
1,Not what you get,"The toy listed here as Sand Creatures, is in fact, not what you will receive. You will receive a Sand Art package which is garbage and on the back it will have a white sticker that states ""Sand Creatures"" which it is not. The actual Sand Creature toy actually cost $19.99 but you will be unable to order from this company, as they will send this other piece of junk. Emails from both Amazon and myself have gone unanswered. Buyer beware"
5,Elvis Christmas,I love Elvis. The cd was great. I wish it had more secular christmas songs. Especially the rocking ones. I used it in a parade and kept playing the first songs over and over.
5,Absolutely love it,This item is Great quality and shipment was super fast. Item was as described as on website and pictured exactly.
4,reply,I can listen to Elvis but I can not watch him or anyone else that tries to impersonate him. Thanks
3,Elvis Christmas CD,"The plastic CD holder was broken when received, however the CD itself was fine. The CD arrived in the allotted time."
5,What a voice!,How can anyone not love Elvis. He is the King of Song with that voice.I could listen to him all day.
1,Elvis Christmas,This is one of Elvis' better Christmas CDs I've purchased. The Song that impressess me the most on this CD is On a Snowy Christmas Night. this is the song that prompted me into buying this CD. It's fantastic!
5,"Great stuff, glad to find","I used Rezamid as a teenager many years ago because a dermatologist recommended it. It worked, and I had no problems with it or complaints about it. Now, deep in middle age, I get occasional, pesky breakouts and have longed for my old but extremely hard to find remedy. Thank you, Amazon!"
4,rezamid,"This product has been around forever although it's hard to find. It works great to clear acne. The problem is the smell, color and the fact that it tarnishes silver jewelry."
5,"I don't use foundation, I use rezamid.","Honestly, to those who are going through acne/have acne prone skin/oily skin or are concerned that foundation will break them out, look no further. I use rezamid as make up, I mix it with a tiny bit of sunscreen/moisturizer and make my own sheer foundation and when i need more coverage I use it by itself! it works so well, doesn't break me out, i've been using it for years. It comes with a color matcher so you can customize the color of it by just a few drops of the matcher. I'm not sure how well that works to match anyone's skin tone, but I love this stuff and I will continue to use it for years.It's been so good to me for over five years. I use it daily."
2,Consistency & color off,"The color of this Rezamid was brownish. I've ordered identical Rezamid in the past, and it has had a pinkish hue, which is more appropriate to my skin color. Also, when I opened this one, it was separated, oily or watery at the top, thicker at the bottom. I'd hoped shaking it would solve the problem, but EVERY time I open it it, I have the same problem. The consistency is not smooth and uniform as with my previous purchase of Rezamid."
4,Worth Trying,"First time I have used this product. Always used Liquimat in the past. This one is a little thinner and goes on better, but you have to really shake the bottle to mix the liquid."
5,love it,fast shipper excellent product only thing that works on facial cystic acne! Try it you'll be glad you did. thanks
4,REZAMID,THE PRICE OF POSTAGE IS KILLING....THE STAMP GOES UP 2 OR 3 CENTS AND THE S/H HAVE A GREAT EXCUSE TO SLAP YOU WITH $2.00 ADDITIONAL....NOT PRETTY!ITEM IS EXCELLENT!!!
5,"you deserve a real audience, Bradford Gowen","I bought the cd years ago, and imported it into iTunes, and am hearing it today for the first time. The recorded piano is fabulous -- hooray for the engineer. The playing is declarative and coherent, a fabulous introduction to 20th Century piano.I came to the mp3 section to see if there was any more of your output online, but alas. You deserve to be well known."
4,"Fun game, bad music","The kids love this game, and have spent many hours since Christmas dancing, laughing, and sweating. We have 2 dancepads, and each ""dancer"" can individually select their own level of difficulty... so you can still dance alongside a friend to the same song even if they are at a higher level than you.The only negative is the songs that it comes with. There are a few recognizable tracks, but most of them are from obscure techno artists or they are in Japanese. I know Konami is a Japanese company, but when we bought Karaoke Revolution and Karaoke Revolution Party, all 50 songs on each game were popular worldwide hits. I figured this would be the same with DDR, but I was wrong. If you aren't into sequences of techno-pop, then this game might be unbearable... or you'll just have to skip over the bulk of the songs."
1,"Defective disc won't play, konami won't honor warranty","I bought this as a gift for my kids.The disc wouldn't play in the XBOX. It doesn't appear to be dirty or scratched, it just doesn't play.No other XBOX title we have (more than 20) has this problem.Even though Konami's warranty states that they will replace any defective item, they refused to do so in this case because it was bought online. There is no language in the warranty distinguishing between buying online or from a traditional retailer.PS: Even though it was beyond Amazon.com's 30 day return period, when I explained the situation to Amazon.com customer support they immediately shipped a replacement. So buy from Amazon.com, just don't buy Konami products."
3,The law comes in the form of lead...,"When Ace Ryan thwarts the assault of a beautiful Mexican girl by a trio of drunken peelers, he provokes the wrath of renegade cattle thief, Matt Kirk. The hunter becomes the hunted when Ryan realizes that Kirk is after much more than just his life?Greed may be Matt's downfall as he gathers his band of rustlers to take over the entire territory and its million dollar cattle industry. The town of Bullhorn and the love Sabrina Horne are his next targets?"
2,High on Form/ Low on Substance,"I would not recommend this book if scholarly research is something that you are concerned with. This book lacks credible sources and citations, and reads like a collection of quaint anecdotes. The author often will say things like ""according to ancient traditions..."" whose traditions are we talking about and why does it matter? I am currently a graduate student in Theology and could write a one page paper that is more informative and substantive than this entire book. And, to make matters worse, this book is rife with cultural misappropriations; it is a classic case of New Age gone bad. Again if sources matter to you, as it does to me, avoid purchasing this book."
3,Good tests - shoddy info,"this is a solid book because of the tests, and thats about it. The exams are solid - but the scoring seems to be a bit off. The info is spotty and incomplete, do not rely on this book for all your info, maybe just as a last minute review. Regardless be sure to take these 3 tests before the real thing, as they definitely keep you honest."
3,Not enough information on product description,"I was thrilled at the quick delivery of this item, but was dissapointed when I read the ""warning"" on the pot's label. It said ""do not use on glass stovetop"". Unfortunately, I do have a glass stovetop, but I need to preserve my garden's harvest soon and I wanted to put up some pickles and jam in jars.Luckily, I read on the Internet that I could use the burner on our gas barbeque. (If I had a Coleman or camp stove, I could use that instead) The barbeque's burner seemed to work OK, but it was inconvenient carrying everything outside to the patio.If the warning about not using the canner on a glass stovetop had been included in the product description, I would have done more research and maybe I'd have bought another type canner."
1,Poor rack for jelly jars...too open... jars fall through.,"I now need to buy 2 racks for the two canners that i purchased, that will prevent the jars from falling between the one support on the rack. At least two supports are required to support the jars...three supports would be the ultimate. Don't buy this one for one pint or half pint jars. it is very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
2,Product sent did not meet website's description,"This was my first time ordering from the Amazon warehouse. I have actually never had a problem with a single item I ordered from Amazon and wasn't expecting one now. However, I ordered the canning pot that was only supposed to have ""packaging defects"" with a canning pot that was brand new and in perfect condition. What I actually got was a canning pot that had cosmetic defects on the outside and the inside. I haven't had a chance to use the product yet, so only time will tell if the defect will require a return."
3,gets the job done,I make jellies. The rack inside really needs revamped somehow to keep the jelly jars from constantly falling over and rolling around. I think I do better just using my own small round broiler pan in the bottom of the cooker like I have always used. I suppose I didn't need to buy this item at all... Although I do like the size of the granite ware cooker.
2,Low quality; false advertising,"This was not at all what I expected and it will be going back. The canning rack is low quality (NOT aluminum as advertised) and does not hold the jars in place. Also, it claims it holds 7 pint jars. It does...if you cram them in. The whole point of the canning rack is to keep the jars in place and from touching. At most you could do 5 jars. It is also a bit on the shallow side. To get the water to cover the lids by an inch, it would likely be boiling over (haven't actually tried, but judging by look of it). Spend a little more and save yourself the time, hassle and disappointment."
1,Unhappy,Ordered this product in September to use next summer for canning. I stupidly didn't open the box and check everything out. I pulled the pan out at Thanksgiving and noticed that there is a hole that goes through the pan on the side so it is unusable. It's too late to send it back now!
5,Perfect for the smaller family.,"I had one of these and gave it to my son who loves to can also. This one is perfect to can all of your pints. (either large mouth or small) I like it because it fits the burners better than my larger canner, and for two of us it is perfect."
3,Wish it were a bit taller,"I normally only can pint or half pint jars, so this is an ideal size for me overall, but it seems a bit too short. There's barely room to cover pint jars with an inch of water, so I really need to keep my eye on it once it's at a rolling boil. I'd be happier if this were a few inches taller, but other than that, it is a nice size, comes to a boil much faster than a larger canner, and the rack holds pint and half pint jars in place better than the racks on larger canners."
4,Water Bath Canner for pint jars,This canner is fine for pint jars except that the rack doesn't hold the jars well enough. They can tip very easily. Perhaps it should be a little taller. It serves my purpose but I have to watch that the jars don't tip. This is easier when the canner is full but more difficult when the canner only holds a couple of jars.
2,Not for glass stovetops,The description says to be careful on glass tops. The instructions and tag on canner says not to use on glass tops.The bottom is not flat so the heat will not transfer correctly.
3,Just the right size.......,"This is for the home canner who wants to go a little slower.....not can so many things at a time. It's perfect for me and I love it. It fits nicely on my electric burner, and cans plenty of jars. It also holds the jars more securely than my big cannner did. I do mostly pint size or smaller jars, and a big canner just didn't hold the jars very securely, and the cannder itself didn't fit on the burner well. This is just right. I'm very impressed with it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to can on a somewhat smaller scale."
3,Made in USA,"I received my ""mini"" canner and was impressed it was made in the USA. But, putting seven wide mouth jars in the canner is not possible. They are way too close for the water to circulate. The handles to lift the jars won't go into the unit when it is full. I like narrow mouth jars for jams and also use 1/2 pints so I am going to have my husband remove the handles and use my jar lifter to put the jars in and to remove them. I like the idea it doesn't use as much water or electricity. It's great but does need to be taller."
4,beth orton should be my girlfriend,"This is an all around excellent album. Beth Orton never disappoints me. Some people whine that this latest album of hers is not experimental enough for her, and while i admit that its not the masterpiece that Central Reservation was, its still a beautiful album, containing songs which are just as notable as any on her other releases. She even mixes it up a bit with old-time collaborator's The Chemical Brothers. My favorite tracks are Paris Train, Concrete Sky, God Song, and Ted's Waltz"
5,Another wonderful musical experience from Beth Orton,"I was first turned on to Beth Orton's music about three years ago when I lived in Seattle, the dreary-is-hip capitol of the Americas. After previewing a few of her songs...,I ended up buying ""Trailer Park"" and ""Central Reservation"" and have fallen in love with both albums since. Their quiet, moody, personal songs have a way of working themselves under your skin. And I adore her singing voice, as flat and cigarette-ravaged as it is ... it sounds like melancholy made flesh.""Daybreaker"" is less electronic and slower than ""TP"" and ""CR"" but also stronger in some ways. She's a young songwriter and you can sense her maturing, especially lyrically. If you like Suzanne Vega, Bjork, Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, Emmylou Harris, and Everything But the Girl, you'd probably find something to love on Beth Orton's albums, this one included..."
2,"If She's So Bored, Why Should I Care?","I first heard Beth Orton doing God Song in a solo performance, late night on a college radio show. The effort was enthralling and I couldn't wait to buy this CD. What a disappointment. I say this as a non-fan, but someone looking to add a new artist to my want list. The vocal efforts on this CD are very irritating. She presents a bored phrasing, almost a groan or bark, that just grates on my inner ear. Is she cool and aloof? Languid? Perhaps less affectation and more singing would have been more to my taste. I'll still listen to God Song - it's even better than I was expecting with Emmylou Harris providing stunning harmonies. Carmella has a clever hook to it, and some vocal energy. And as long as I am there, I might listen to Thinking About Tomorrow. So 2 1/2 good songs, that's a 2 star CD. But I would have preferred not to have spent the money on Daybreaker."
4,I Like This CD- Finally!,"I bought this CD over a year ago, and was thouroughly disappointed. I was convinced that I had wasted my money and only played it as backround music at work so that I felt better about spending the money on it. Well, I should be ashamed that I felt that way, or maybe my taste of music has just changed that much in one year. Surfing around on Amazon today, I came across her name again and read some of the reviews. With so many positive ones, I figured I must give this CD a try again. She has this raspy, soothing voice, that just draws you in. I like this CD much better this time around and will definatly take the time to listen more carefully over the next few days. The music, the guitar, blend perfectly with her singing. A real gem in my music collection that I'm glad I was able to let shine again!!"
4,Best Orton so far,"I preordered this album and got to give it a listen via streaming (Thanks Amazon!) This is a nice album. Like most Beth Orton discs, this one will probably take a bit of time to grow on me, but I have to say that at first listen this one already has me enthralled beyond what her past albums have been able to achieve up-front. Having come upon Beth Orton via her work with Chemical Brothers, the transition to her sometimes dreary folk sensibility was gradual for me, but well worth the effort. Her voice, as always, is as flat as non-gloss, eggshell paint. Still, she always hits everything right on both emotionally and technically, albeit unconventionally. I recommend this album as a first Orton album, especially if you have enjoyed her voice on such tunes as CB ""Where Do I Begin."""
3,It's Beth Orton,"Okay, the first thing you notice about Beth Orton's new release ""daybreaker"",is the cover's striking similarity to any number of deodorant advertisements. The theme continues on the back cover as the gangly Beth Orton is shown frolicking in the foamy surf wearing jean shorts and a white tanktop, one leg kicked out behind her in a gesture as if to say, ""Finally a pad that suits my lifestyle."" This has to be one of the worst covers in history. What was she thinking? Does the mood of these photos fit the album? Yeah, kinda i guess, but they are so uninspired. The fact of the matter is, the music on Daybreaker really doesn't seem that compelling at first. It does seem bland and unispired. But, the more you listen to it the more levels you feel and hear. To quate from another review ""it's a grower"", and this is so true. Don't dismiss the album at your first listen. It has many sublime moments of brilliance."
1,Yawn,"Her whiny voice, dreary music style, and jaded lyrics are enough to put me to sleep. 3 tracks were good but none of them incredible: ""This One's Gonna Bruise,"" ""Concrete Sky,"" & ""Daybreaker."""
1,Bland Follow Up!,"I loved Beth Orton's last album, ""Central Reservation."" This album; however, lacks everything that made her last release great. Songs need a chorus or at least something of interest to make them listenable. Not even the William Orbit-produced tracks are worth buying. I would recommend getting some of her previous releases and leaving this one alone. Even die-hard Beth Orton fans are sure to be disappointed in this release. It lacks inspiration. It's a shame that someone with so much talent could release such a bad product."
1,Unimpressed,"Beth may be a good songwriter, but as a singer she is unimpressive. She is monotone in voice and is difficult to understand. Her music would be better off if she allowed someone else to do the singing."
4,Undeniably honest,"This is Orton's thrid album and the first thing that strikes you is the voice, undeniably Orton...low-key but memorable.On this album, Orton's lyrics are starkingly honest and revealing. The album is an ecletic collection of songs that reaches deep down your soul and reveberates with emotions.At first listen, it may not impact you. But with several listens, the album is definitely a solid record! Well worth the time to listen. Although Orton might not be big but what she makes is surely music to my ears."
4,Electronic Folk,"Beth Orton makes rhythmic, electronic, folk music. Her latest cd is every bit as good and even more consistent than her critically acknowledged ""Central Reservation"". These songs wrap Bjorkish, hauntingly atmospheric arrangements around lush melodies and potent lyrical imagery. Atop them rides Orton's unique voice (as if Judy Collins had swallowed Marianne Faithfull's rasp) and insinuative phrasing. With guest appearances by the ubiquitous Emmylou Harris and the becoming-nearly-as-ubiquitous Ryan Adams, this nevertheless is Orton's showcase and its a beaut."
4,"Beautiful, Heartfelt, and Emotional","Beth Orton is a unique artist. Her voice is soothing and relaxed and comforts your soul. The songs on Daybreaker feature very intelligent lyrics and are breathtaking. The songs feature acoustic guitar and atmospherickeyboard work. Daybreaker is on the mellow side, sometimes lyrically dark and very moving. Her first album, Trailor Park, features more of a folk pop sound. The second album, Central Reservation is a classic!!!!!"
4,"A throwback to what folk once was, and maybe yet to return","Daybreaker is awesome, not for who she is with, but for the haunting lyrics and voice Beth Orton has. I first heard her doing a cover of a Fred Neil Song (Dolphins), her rendition compares with the original by recently past, but never forgotten Fred Neil.Can't wait for more from Beth Orton!!!"
3,"Daybreaker, but a lttle cloudy","I first heard Beth Ortons unique voice back in 96 when she was guesting Chemical brothers debut ""Exit planet dust"" the same year she released her own debut ""Trailer park"" one of the best albums that year.Now, this effort doesn't show the same standards throughout, the first half of the album however displays some very beautiful material right up there with the best of her backcatalog, but then all of a sudden she gets a bit too folky on us (for my taste at least) and the beauty slowly dries out and become all too....hmm......boring I guess.Still nobody can claim her voice and the immense charisma that it posseses also in the more ""boring"" songs.Best songs: track 1 through to 4 and then 6"
5,Well Worth the Wait,"Wonderful Beth is something of an enigma. On first listen, her collections always sound bland. Nice, sweet, haunting, even--but bland. But somehow, the listener always wants to hear the CD ""just one more time.""And one more time after that. And each time, the subtle poetry of Beth Orton, her unique voice, her use of music as a key to unlocking her (and our) most private thought just grows and grows.A friend of mine bought this CD the first day it was available (as did I). We both thought it was nice, but ordinary. Yesterday we discussed it again. I admitted I can't stop listening, and that I find something new every time I do. My friend agreed entirely, and gave what has to be the most understated compliment of all: ""This one's a grower.""And so it is. Give it a listen and be enchanted."
5,bzbx - I'm a BIG fan.,"I love to spread the gospel according to Beth. This CD did not grab me at first, but the more I listened to it the more I liked it. I think it's great - just like Beth."
5,Beautiful and Melodious! Check out 'Me Died Blue' too!,"'Daybreaker' is chock full of quality introspective and heartfelt songs about loss and heartbreak, done in an alternative rock and folk style. The songs are lush and beautiful, yet feel simple and satisfying to the soul. Another great artist I can't stop obsessing to these days is Steven Delopoulos, an up and coming singer/songwriter/guitarist from NJ. His ravely reviewed release 'Me Died Blue' is the most AMAZING, beautiful folk/rock release i've heard in a decade! A voice and acoustic guitar, with great backround musicians that send chills up your spine, great memorable songcraft that grabs you, and clockwork compositions/arrangements! If anyone tells you the oft heard phrase 'but there's nothing good out these days', point them in the direction of Beth Orton and Steven Delopoulos! Quality songcraft is very much alive and well!"
5,A wonderful magical book.,"This book won't be as popular as it should be. That's a shame. It is a wonderful book about a magical place in Kansas. Yes, Kansas. Wonderful things happen in this magical place. Read it, recommend it, give it as a gift."
2,BookReader,"Much more mature subject matter than I expected. Not for most 8-12 year olds, unless they've had an extremely eclectic lifestyle."
2,Works inconsistently,"When it works it works well. I bought it to use with this sweet keyboard from Siig:Minitouch PS/2 Plus 80-KEY Mini-keyboard. I've used it on a few different machines and my complaint is it doesn't consistently connect the keyboard. It requires pinching and squeezing and reconnecting and angling just so to get the signal through. Once it starts working, it is fine until you unplug it. This does not happen when I plug the PS/2 keyboard into a PS/2 jack."
3,OVER PRICED !!,"We were very disappointed in this book. We really expected something more comprehensive. However, upon closer examination of the editorial review it is not touted as a text for Admins. It DOES reference ""new users"" and ""students"". But given that, this book is WAY OVER PRICED for the amount of information it contains. While the book does contain some good information, there were times when I found it less than accurate. For the amount you are paying for this text, that seems inexcusable. Personally, there are a lot better books for the target group(s) this is aimed at for a whole lot less money. However, I give it the three stars because a lot of information is treated well for beginners. In fact, we would give it more stars in that respect, but the price is ridiculous."
4,LOOKS AWESOME!,"I msut admit I haven't played this game yet, but it looks really great. I'm exited that I'll be able to get all the Pokemon I missed in Ruby/Sapphire at last and trade them over. I also think the new Union Room, which is kind of like a chat room thing, sounds awsome. The wireless feature is a cool change from the ordinary.One thing I will miss is the Pokemon Contests, but even so, this new game sounds like a great addition to the Pokemon series."
2,lame attempt of a remake,"This game is a remake of the original red and blue pokemon games. while the first 2 were really good because the concept of pokemon was new, these are just remakes of the first one. pointless if you ask me. why would nintendo make a game exactly the same as the first. Yeah, you can link up with ruby and saphire, but why? It doesn't help the pokedex, in ruby and saphire, but it also doesn't help in fire red and leaf green. And why did they give it a different ad like,""new concept captures the game better."" and also a different title I mean, I can imagine something like ""POKEMON BLUE ADVANCE"" but giving it a totaly different title is dumb. I don't think making this game has a point. if you want this game don't get it. Get red or blue. The originals you can't find in stores but you can find it online"
2,Whats the point?,"Dear god nintendo is remaking red and blue (green in Japan) versions!! Fire Red and Leaf Green are just red/blue verisons with updated grpahics and sounds and a few new features like the wireless adaptor, Ruby and Sapphire pokemon, able to trade with sapphire and ruby, and these new islands. Basicly you cannot go to Honnin or Jhoto it's just Kento another thing thats pretty sad about these games nintendo can make wireless link cables yet they can't put the new wrolds in? Red and Blue version where the best versions ever I'm sticking with the originals"
5,Good but boring after mewtwo.,"This game is really fun. I first played pokmon silver and I think that silver and gold were one of the best ones. I would end up playing it for hours. Anyways pokemon fire red version is a greate game. I will give the ""Pokemon Company"" that. But after you catch mewtwo in cerulian cave, there is really nothing else fun to do unless of corse you wanted to buy the e-reader, e-reader slider card and get the aurora ticket to get ho-oh and lugia and deoxxys. Well you can spend most of your time trying to catch all the pokemon but there is just one problem to that. There is just one pokemon in the whole game that nobody knows how to get. Celibi. Celibi is a very good pokemon to have if you know how to use her right. There is only one way that I know how to get her. You have to trade her from pokemon silver(If you know how to get her from there, cuzz if you dont then you really need some help). Well I think I m just about done so later."
5,This game is neat but...,It is awsome the graphics & everything but it is a redo of the orgianl blue & red. It is in color as the comparisn to the old ones. I think sapphire or ruby is best though. Wirless adaptor neat
2,MISSED opportunity!,"Once again, Nintendo has found a way to blow a good opportunity. Don't get me wrong. The games sound good, but there is one problem: they lied about catching them all. If you could catch them all, instead of picking Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle as a starter, you could find and CATCH them in the wild. You can't do that in these versions. Maybe I'll get this game or save my money on something else. But, for once Nintendo, make a version of Pokemon in which you can REALLY catch all the Pokemon without buying another game in order to catch a certain pokemon. PLEASE?!?!?"
1,Pokémon is childish!,"Pokemon; is like so old; and Nintendo is sitting on the ledge of their backs trying to revive a game and trading cards for little babies and toddlers. Even the whole Pokémon fad are mostly consisted of 5 - 12 year-old Asians that can't do anything better than to play some Japanese crap.Get to play something like Mario, and also play the old arcade classics like Galaga, Donkey Kong, Xevious, Pole Position, more others and the legendary Ms. and Pac Man which are all classified as the most popular games of all time - thus which you call are REAL games and not like a game that involves baby cute monsters with annoying little Anime characters battling with their.Or, if you don't prefer to play REAL games then you'd rather spend playing sports and other stuff in the outside world. Oh; when will this craze ever die? So we can get back to our living needs?Pokemon must die."
1,LET IT DIE!!,This game is so dumb! Why don't people let the world of Pokemon die? These people are going to keep making dumb games like these if people don't stop buying it.
5,best pokemon game EVER!!!!!,"Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen are going to be the best games ever!You know the cables that let you battle and trade?Well ditch the cables, 'cause FireRed/LeafGreen come with a wireless adapter that is good to trade,chat,or battle with people that have one and are 30 feet away from you or less!!!There is a new pokemon called Deoxys that look different depending on what game you have.The bad thing is that there are no more pokemon contests.You can play mini games though!"
5,this one awesome game,At last a pokemon game that allows you to catch em allplus this game comes with an Wireless adopter which is way better than a link cable.the first time l saw this game in a maganzine l thought wow. also l try out the other pokemon gamesand beat it(except for the catch em all)and l bet this game will do too
5,AWESOME,"The newest installment to the pokemon world is here--Pokemon Firered--!With all new pokemon to catch,a new region to explore,new Professor....Professor Oak!Oh I forgot you can play as a new trainer!!!Try trading with Ruby,Sapphire,and Leafgreen.Please buy this game"
5,THE best pokemon game ever!,Hi! I'm a 10 year old boy and I want to say that this is the best pokemon game ever! It has ALL the stuff it does in red & green version (green is made in japan) but this has better graphics and you can catch a pikachu in varidian forest!I recommend this game to everyone who likes pokemon!
5,OMG!!!! THE COMPANY HAS OUTDONE THEMSELVES ON THIS GAME.,"I HAVENT REALLY PLAYED THIS GAME YET SINCE IT DIDNT CUM OUT YET, BUT I THINK THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE THE BEST. U SAVE ALOT OF MONEY BECAUSE THIS GAME HAS ALL OF THE GAMES MADE FOR GAMEBOY ADVANCE AND MORE THAN 300 POKEMONS(PLUS NEW ONES). IT HAS NEW FEATURES AND COMES WITH AN ADAPTAR(WIRELESS!!!). SO KEWL. ITS LIKE A WALKIE TALKIE THAT GOES FAR AS AROUND 3 MILES AND ITS FREE. THE CREATORS OF POKEMON HAS OUTDONE THEMSELVES IN ANOTHER GREAT POKEMON GAME WIT GREAT GRAPHICS."
5,best game ever,"if you like action, advanture,gameply,battling and fun get this game and never stop playing."
2,not the same as in my 89 supra,"this item is entirely different than the one in my 89 supra, i have to return the product."
2,This product was not properly described.,"The product that I received is partly vanillin, an artificial vanilla. I expected to get PURE mexican vanilla. Naturally I was disappointed."
1,"Not special, just regular vanilla",This is just regular vanilla. It does NOT have the special mexican vanilla flavor I am looking for. It also has a bitter after taste.
3,Mexican vanilla,"Vanilla has a good flavor, but it is not the quality or the taste of the same name brand of vanilla that I obtained years ago in Mexico."
1,"Tasty, but fake, possibly Toxic vanilla.","It says Vanilla all over the bottle, but vanilla is not in the Ingredients. This is purely a mix of artificail ingredients and other ""natural"" (possibly toxic)substances that resemble vanilla taste, yet there is no actual vanilla in this.I would definitely spend more money and research time before buying this. Don't be fooled!"
5,I love this!,"I know it's not pure, but I honestly think it has a much better taste and smell then any ""pure"" vanilla extract I have had. I always can taste the alcohol in pure vanilla extracts, I can't in this one. It just taste like candy. I use it for baking of coarse but it is equally great in my coffee. It never claims to be pure. Read the label, don't assume!"
2,Great substitute for vanilla extract but...,"I buy this very same vanilla blend in the 8.4 oz bottle at Walmart in the Mexican food aisle for about 2 bucks and some change. It's great for baking because most people will not notice a difference. I make my own vanilla, but always have a bottle or 2 of Molina's in my cabinet for baking in large quantities. I wouldn't pay this price for it and if there is a Walmart nearby, nobody should."
1,what a rip off,"I cannot believe the price of this workout. It does not worth that much at all. Besides of price, the workout must be for people with serious back injuries. I do not stand straight and through this work out would help my posture. It did nothing. It is boring as hell and it is so basic, it is even less then basic it is some very slow movements that resembles Pilates movements. I am willing to give it away for free, just pay for shipping, and it will be yours. I only watched one time and it was enough for me,"
2,A little boring,"I bought this with my 13 year old daughter in mind since I am constantly nagging her to straighten up. Rather than continue on this path, I thought she could benefit from some Pilates exercises, particularly one with this title. We started to watch it and frankly was so bored that I of course could not expect her to do it. It certainly is not stimulating for a very young audience (or even for me and I am most definitely middle aged). There is probably an audience out there but it's not us."
4,best of,"of the 7 hancock cd""s i own this would be about #5 just not a good mix. better examples of excellence would be neon,tulsa,a train."
3,"Not a ""World Literature"" text","The private school where I teach uses the A Beka curriculum, so this is the text I have to use for World Literature classes. Overall it is a decent anthology of short fiction and poetry. The major weakness is that it lacks a global perspective. There is an alarming paucity of voices from South America, Africa, and Asia. A more accurate title for the text would be ""American and European Literature."" I hope future editions of the text address this deficiency."
5,"Best firewire card for audio, hands down","Simply put, several different makers of firewire interfaces recommend THIS firewire card to put in your computer if you want unflinching reliability. Just goes to show, you have to go beyond what's on the shelf at a local store to get something specific like this for the PC Home Recording Studio market that computer accessory stores flat out ignore. If you can wait for this to come in the mail, it's a no-brainer."
5,Great shampoo,"I've been using Ionil-T for over 35 years. I have had very dry skin ever since I was a kid and this is the only stuff that works. Not even the better smelling Ionil-T Plus works for me, just this particular tar shampoo, which is getting harder and harder to find. It is expensive but so is going to a dermatologist, and they don't come up with anything better than this. If you haven't used it for awhile and your scalp is itchy, it feels great to wash your hair with this shampoo. It tingles and goes to work right away. You would think that it was a harsh shampoo and would damage your hair, but this is not what I've experienced at all. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy feeling. Yes, the smell is strong when you first use it and it takes some getting used to and it is a very liquidy shampoo, but the results are worth it. I noticed this last time I purchased it, it seemed a bit thicker so maybe they are thickening it up a bit. Highly recommend."
3,"It's O.K., but.......","I've had psoriasis for about 30 years. I used the Ionil -T products for years at the suggestion of my dermatologist, and they worked well. I went to this plain shampoo (no conditioner) as the price started going up, and used it for a long time. Then, when the price on this stuff doubled in 12 months, I started looking around, and found this deal on Amazon for two 16-oz. bottles of the Beta-Tar gel shampooBetatar Gel Shampoo, Dandruff Shampoo, 16 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)for less money than one bottle of the Ionil-T. It's twice the strength (2% coal tar) and lathers a WHOLE lot better than the Ionil-T ever did. I've been using the Beta-Tar product for about a year now, and I am very pleased with the results for my scalp psoriasis. Check out my review at the product site."
5,ionil-T,This is an exceallant product. The best I have found for controlling dandruff in over 40 years of using dandruff shampoo. It is long lasting and effective even when not used on a daily basis.
3,Not working for me.,"Despite the fact that on the label somewhere it states that it contains chemicals known to cause cancer, I took the risk but I didn't get the expected results. After using it for a few weeks 2-3 times a week, it seemed that I am on the path of finally getting rid of my flakes and dandruff. Later on, it came all back. Not at much as before but still enough. I haven't used any other hair cleaner or any sprays or mousse while I used this product. I wouldn't buy it again. The smell is also pretty bad."
3,Modern Studio Sound,"A great deal of work went into this recording.It has a great selection of early music. But thesound is too perfect, too modern. An early musicCD should sound like it was recorded in a castle.It should sound like a group of musicians founda meeting place in a village in Bavaria. It shouldnot sound like it was studio recorded in 2005. Yesthat does mean lower quality recording, less perfectenunciation, less balance of instruments, imperfecttiming and beats, and more disorganization. Thisdoesn't mean a drunken revelry CD. It just needsto sound like you are a child in a chilly castle,witnessing history, hundreds of years ago. TryMedieval and Renaissance: Minstrels, Songs andDances by Musica Antiqua or for all vocal EnglishMedieval Christmas by New York Pro Musica to reallybe transported back in time."
5,Christus est natus...!,I love this CD.It helps me to put Christmas in perspective and to remember the true meaning of the nativity.
5,Love it,Was looking for peaceful and traditional medieval/renaissance music and this was a great fit. I highly recommend it AND MAKES EXCELLENT HOLIDAY MUSIC.
5,Feasting indeed! One of my new favorites!,"Having already downloaded some Barry and Beth Hall songs, I had the realistic hope that I would enjoy this. It is easily everything which I had hoped to enjoy and more."
3,Still A Kid,"Yes, this is a film from the 50's or 60's. Yes, it is low budget and the acting shows it. It is also a film for kids (of all ages perhaps) and it was never supposed to be up for an academy award - which is a good thing. But for what it is worth, I first saw it as a kid, it was one of my favorite stories as a kid and now, as an adult, I am glad to have it in my collection. It is good escapist material after a day's work - not every day, of course. And it does go well with cheese and beer. Some people will say that it is cheesey enough on its own. Maybe they need more beer! You could do a lot worse than this - especially if you have kids in the house. I know. I'm in my 50's and I'm still a kid. I even named a car Sybil because of this movie. Having read some of the other reviews, perhaps I should mention that the color in my copy is OK."
2,Get the MGM version....,Just started this movie a little while ago. Color & sound are good however there is a censered nude scene of the princess coming out of the water in the first few minutes of the film. You can tell she is nude in the water but when she comes out there is some pixillation (at the lower right of the picture) then a quick cut to where a towel is brought up to her.I hope the widescreen MGM version (at $12.99) shows this scene intact also there are reviewes of the film there...
3,Sword and Sorcery Classic?,"If ever a movie about swords and sorcery can be slow and boring,then this one qualifies.With all sorts of dwarfs, dragons, goblins and monsters this one manages to drag on. The acting is minimal and the script is just bad.They made a color movie that should have been an instant hitas it is fantasy and fairy tale like,but they just did a bad job.The Princess is fat and the evil wizard is just not evil enough?The hero is less than inspiring after imprisoning his mother in a crack in the Earth. I sorry about this: I had great hopes for this movie when I got it."
3,A masterpiece love story,"This film has everything a hopeless romantic could want. Forbidden love, facing danger for love, and winning true love. It's a love story!A knight with a magic sword goes on a quest to rescue a beautiful princess from an evil wizard. After trapping a witch (who I swore was Phillis Diller), he gets a magic sword and brings to life six knights, each from a different nation. We have a German knight, and Irish knight, a French knight, etc. All accents are horrible, but they all speak English.Well the knights face danger and are picked off until they arrive at the Evil Sorceror's castle (which looks surprisingly like a farmhouse!) After fighting a double headed sock puppet dragon. The knight wins his true love.And the evil wizard? He is mad his dragon has been killed. He is about to unleash a fury like no one has ever seen. ""I am INVINCABLE!"" he proclaims with outstretched arms. But before he can do anything he is mauled by the witch who had transformed herself into a puma."
2,The Magic Sword,This should have been a better quality production - not sure why it failed to entertain...
3,Was good...still good,"As a Kid, i only saw what i liked in this movie...Monsters, witches, thebattle of good against evil. The characters were great and one becameinvolved in the movie from beginning to end. Nope... i did'nt care aboutwho acted...how good the special effects were, how much it cost to make.All i knew is this movie when on tv took hold of my imagination and heldme in front of the tv till the end came. Wow, that was a trip.So today, not a Kid anymore....the movie is still as good....and itseasy not to focus on the low budget flaws that we notice more as wegrow up. A keeper for those who like this type."
3,SWORDS AND SORCERY,"When watching a movie like ""The Magic Sword"", you have to smile at the camp and amateurism that often frequents a film like this. Bert I. Gordon did his first color movie with this one, and for the time it was made, the special effects are above average for this time. The dragon is hilarious; as are the conehead ripoffs. But, Estelle Winwood, what a wonderfully zany actress she was, and she steals the movie whenever she's on. Gary Lockwood, undeniably a hunk, is not the world's greatest actor here, although he went on to gain respect in the t.v. series, ""The Lieutenant"" and the movie, ""2001."" Anne Helm looks lovely but no more range than a Barbie Doll. Basil Rathbone is effectively hammy in his role as Lodac the evil sorcerer. One question though: they were supposed to encounter seven curses, I missed one somewhere?Cheesy but enjoyable."
1,HAHAHAHAHA,What a craptastic film. HAHAHAHAHAHA. It sucks so bad I can't stop laughing at it. This could be the worst film I ever saw. What the hell? Did it just go to black and white for that seen. What the hell? I can't tell if this is a color film or not. WHAT THE HELL?!
3,The Magic Sword,"If you saw this film when it first came out, like I did, you'll be delighted that it's available. If you didn't and you are expecting something from the ""digital era"" you may be very disappointed. This is a kids film. I love this film for the escape. Are there ruff edges? Sure. I am a fan of Gary Lockwood (2001:a space odyssey)and it is fun to see him back then. Basil Rathbone can never do any wrong. Ann Helm? What's not to love? So...enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it. The 1963 version of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" with Steve Reeves is the same kind of escape. If you want to get a bit ""heady"" about these films, they are about struggle. I can always place myself somewhere in there (they both have 7 stages of strife) and it can actually help me figure out things at times. Don't ever let your ""kid"" grow up!"
2,One extra star...,"for the unintentional laughs the movie provides. Otherwise, even at 7 bucks, this is pretty much overpriced. Apparently, Bert I. Gordon lost his touch sometime in the early 60s. Not only is the print absolutely horrible, but the sets, costumes and acting are almost at Ed Wood level. The extra knights, with their fake accents and dubious deaths, Sybil and her malfunctioning magic (not to mention her ""three"" assistants), the evil sorceror with the semi-dramatic entrances, the valley-girl princess, the occasionally-glowing horse, the cheesy monsters and the villian that resembles Lyle Waggoner all combine for a true laugh-fest in the MSFT vein. My guess is that Rathbone must have had serious financial problems or was coerced into doing this one drunken night. Even he's awful."
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As a movie buff and fan of classic action/sdventure/fantasy films I was extremely let down by this film. Having enjoyedwatching Basil Rathbone in such films as ""The Mark of Zorrow"" and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" I was hoping for much more. This film plays as nothing more than a poorly made Saturday morning childrens show. The special effects are ridiculous and so poorly done it's obvious that this film doesn't even rate as a B-movie. If you are over the age of 5 and love classic movies such as the two mentioned above and ""The Knights of the Round Table"", ""Ivanhoe"", ""The Crimson Pirate"" etc. please don't waste your money on this film. You will find yourself turning it off after the first 10 minutes wondering why you were foolish enough to throw away money on something so poorly made. It's not even one of those films that's so bad it's entertaining. It's just plain bad."
5,Excellent,This cd is great! I use it on the treadmill at the gym. You can really work up a sweat dancing to these tunes!
4,"TO THE JERK WHO ""HATES"" KELLY CLARKSON","Anybody who ""hates"" Kelly is just plain sour grapes.Good lord,she is rising up the old fashioned way..SHE EARNED IT,AND WORKED FOR IT..you my friend are a real loser..This is a really good album,buy it and turn it up !"
1,Huh??,"This CD is not good, why do people buy junk like that all the time. These remixes are horrible and even the original versions are not that great either. Trash this CD and buy something else."
2,"Confusing, Very...; And Too Comically Stupid...","I Have To Agree With That Reviewer From Omaha, ( Morgoth ), 'cause He Just About Summed It Up Right. It's Just Such A Shame To See Cheng Sing, Delong Tam And Ti Lung Look So Stupid In This Flick Because Of The Director's Incompetence. You're Right 'Morgoth' The Director Seemed To Have Had All The Right 'Tools'...., etc., But Made Such A Mess Of This Film. I Think Delong Tam, Cheng Sing And Ti Lung Should've Gotten Their Attorneys And Threaten The Director And The production Company Involved Not To Release This Film In Fear Of Damaging Their Reputation. Still Their Presence Seem To Add A Certain Prestige To The Film, But Only Just So, Which Is Why I Give It A 2 Star."
3,Mostly excellent; sometimes melodramatic and contrived,"All the elements were here for an excellent novel: interesting interpersonal interaction between characters; an easily read writing style; plots and subplots that bounce off each other. But when I'd closed the book at the last page, I had the feeling I'd just watched a marathon run of a daytime soap opera. In fact, except for the homosexuality of the central character, Theo, and his spouse, Sam, the whole thing could have easily been a plot for The Guiding Light. And the characters themselves, with the exception of Susan Zack, Theo's daughter's mother, seemed rather stock to me: especially Theo, whose central conflict between a noble career and a home life, offered nothing new on the subject.All in all, I think our fiction ought to do more (or at least different) things from our sit-coms and soap operas."
3,"Yes, but","The knife itself is satisfactory, neither great nor terrible. Under normal circumstances it shold do everything it's designed for so long as you don't expect it to work on an every day basis. It is, after all, an emergency kit. Its biggest problem is replacement or repair. Apparently the distributor has made no arrangement for maintenance. Whether it be a broken blade or replacing the ball point pen, you are stickly on your own!"
1,lousy quality,the miss a kit is lousy quality. i begged for it for about 6 months and my mom got it for me for Christmas and it broke within 1 day. me and my mom agree that it is lousy quality and if you are looking for a sturdy knife i would recommend Victorinox Classic Little Pocketknife Toolbox. if it is for a girl they do come in pink but if you do not like that knife the original swiss army knife is a great choice. both knives are better quality than the miss a kit. i really loved the idea and tools but the quality left much to be desired.
5,Excellet Gift For Your Daughter,"My daughter simply loves this item. Very handy, compact, and versatile. A great wonderful gift for anyone's daughter."
1,false advertising and other problems,"The actual comforter is quite nice. That's were the good part ends. The picture includes pillow shams, but the pillow shams did not come. The five pieces are the comforter, fitted sheet, flat sheet, one pillow case, two pillow case. The pillow cases both face the same direction, so you can't even make the bed properly. The material of the sheets is cheap, and the sheets are a generic baseball print."
5,Poor Mal!,"I know how she feels! Like you never have privacy or quiet time unless you're home alone, which is not often. so sometimes, you have to make that known!"
3,good book,"my favourite parts are how mallory wins the award for writing a book in a contest at stoneybrook middle school, though it was unrealistic how the ceremony was held on a saturday morning and every parent and student in the school showed up, who does that saturdays, honestly? I really enjoyed the shopping trip and the scavenger hunt parts in the book too, but I found some parts boring which is why I took off two stars. The ""ballet"" her sisters put on one afternoon was funny though."
1,Do Not Buy - $30 not well spent...,"Not a recommended book.I have bought it following the recommendation of the author Daniel Quinn. However this book is a major disappointment.It's a complicated text, with not a single new idea. It just keeps stating the obvious that children are:1. Negatively affected by adult mistreatment.2. Grow up to be unhappy and child mistreating adults.3. The above is heavily tied to the culture and prevailing ideology.Tell us something new..."
5,The Ultimate Naturalist,"E.O. Wilson is America's foremost writer on biology, biodiversity, and conservation. (He has two Pulitzer Prizes to prove it.)In ""Nature Revealed,"" we get a look at his most significant writings, just as they appeared in the original journals. This selection gives us a look into the mind of one of today's most brilliant and influential scientists, but it also presents a moving clarification of some of the most important conservation issues facing us today. Everyone who cares about the fate of the earth should read this book."
2,Going Blind?,"Wilson is brilliant and this book contains a wonderful variety of his work in their original form. But why is it reproduced in teeny tiny print? Better buy a magnifying glass too if you want to read everything. Also some articles were originally printed in color so maps and graphs with color coding are lost in black white and gray. I only gave this book two stars for the presentation, not the content."
4,Finally! I've Been Looking for This!,"I have been in the market for car seat covers for well over a year now. The one I purchased on ebay was well over $100. This one is much more budget friendly. The fabric is amazingly soft and the cover itself is well made. The only reason I can't give this product 5 stars is because it's just a bit too small for my son's convertible car seat. I still have the cover on, but it probably would fit better if we had a bit more fabric. Otherwise, I'm happy to find a company that makes things like this. Talk about a car seat saver! It's so great to pop it in the washing machine instead of detailing the car seat on a regular basis! Gave our car seats makeovers!"
5,Great product,It fit perfect on the my sons old car seat my daughter loves...it was easy to install ...
2,The product description is not complete,"This light/radio seems to work OK once initially charged. However, before the hand crank or solar feature can be used it must be charged for 5 hours using a 12 volt AC adaptor. This adaptor is NOT included with the product and must be purchased seperately."
4,GREAT!,"I bought this item and it works great. The reason it got four stars is because I dropped six inches or less out of my hand onto the table when I first got it and cracked the clear plastic piece above the solar panels. Not bad, just enough to make me not trust the reliability of it. It holds a charge while playing the radio for about 40 minutes. Two minutes of cranking gets me about 20 minutes of play time.The light works well enough for a small LED system. I am thinking about upgrading the lights to a 3 LED set. There is plenty of room for it in the casing. I get about 25 minutes with the flashlight function running, but its not bright at all."
4,3.5 Stars,"Sentenced has put out a very listenable album to end their career. Most of the songs take on a death theme, but I don't get the sense that they were very sad while making this cd. In fact, it seems like they were just doing what they loved and isn't that how we all want to die?"
2,melodic metal,i didnt like this album as well as i liked the cold white light. still its a good melodic metal album and everyone should have sentanced in their collection.
1,Waste of time!,"I have noticed that this software malfunctions each time I restart my computer I have to always re-install it when I want to use it. This is really frustrating, or is it why the price is cheap??? I don't know if I am the only person having this problem since others gave it a good review. I bought it based on the review but I am regretting it now. Buyers just make sure u are prepared for what I am going through before you buy, in case yours is a waste like mine!"
1,Scratchy sound -- forget it.,Nice concept but quality of sound is scratchy.A classic handset and skype key are a better alternative for phone calls using skype over voip.
1,Hello there.....,"It took me forever to get into the story and it never really clicked for me. There is one part in the book where for several pages the author simply fills in the space with specifics of Admiralty Law. The facts pertaining to the specific situation could've been elicted in a much more entertaining manner by use of dialogue or description. There were a lot of typos, a lot of jumping around and the plot did not move forward in a smooth manner. One story line involving two women and a bump on the head were self-serving and unnecessary. A lot of other stuff just didn't make sense condsidering Doc's background as a covert operative and no drama was ever achieved. Wondering where the editor was on this one? Sorry, Doc, I just didn't like it."
2,wait for the paperback,"This was a very disappointing entry in the Doc Ford series. I would like to be more specific, but I read it two months ago (why does Amazon wait so long to solicit reviews?) and have read several dozen other books since then--all of which I have enjoyed much more than I did Dark Light."
2,Bring Back Doc Ford,"I was very disappointed with this book. However, I did struggle through it all. I've ready every one of RWW books and usually can't wait for his next book to arrive. I'm hoping this was just a glitch in a long long line of Doc Ford books. One thing was gratifying, Doc Ford finally went after a women that wasn't half his age. Just next time she doesn't have to be twice his age!!!!!"
1,Dark Light Books on CD,"I have enjoyed all the Doc ford novels on tape/CD, except this one. The Story is great but the Reader is absolutely terrible. I would not waste money on this audio version."
1,Great except for the Narrator,"Too bad they chose Henry Stozier. Good narrator - lousy at doing dialogue. Instead of entertained, I had to work at deciphering who was talking. He tried once to change his voice a little for Tomlinson, but otherwise, every one sounded the same.RWW probably didn't notice because he wrote it and knew who was talking. Henry had the book in front of him. A listener who never read the book will have a tough time.I love RWW and won't give up, even if I have to switch to hard copy. But, those weekly airplane commutes to work, the weekend walks on the beach, and the evenings in the gym are going to feel a whole lot longer and lonelier. Please, Randy, next time....anyone other than Henry."
3,Maybe my last Doc Ford,"I've read 6-8 Doc Ford books in basically chronological order. This one seemed different. If I wasn't already invested in the series I might have given up on this one. If this had been my first Doc Ford, I probably wouldn't have read any others. If you're involved in the series, this one is OK, but otherwise I'd suggest a pass."
2,A Nazi Enigma....maybe,"My neighbor recommended this author and lent me 5 books by Randy Wayne White. I chose to begin with this one, as it was the oldest that she lent me. I have to say I could barely get through this book, which went all over the place. The plot moved excruciatingly slowly, although the Nazi references were interesting. The character Chessie was an enigma...was she Marlissa? Was she a ghost? It made no sense. The Tomlinson hippie pot smoking character reminded me of people from the '70s, so I could relate. Don't know if I dare read another one of these!"
4,Interesting Story,"Living in South Florida I look forward to this authors work, as much for the atmosphere as the story. Fortunately this particular effort is most satisfying. A mysterious beauty, sunken treasure, Nazi artifacts, murder, and plenty of bad guys to go around give Doc Ford plenty to do. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to those who like a light read with plenty of action."
2,"Like my editor used to say, ""it's pretty good""","Where to start? I love the Sanibel/Doc Ford stories. I love Sanibel. I go back there every year. This land-locked Floridian wallows in Florida myth, legend and just stories about redneck cow chasers, crooks, all things water and any story by Randy White. BUT, I was confused a lot by this story. It just seemed a bit of a rip off. It just didn't seem honest somehow and I don't even know if that makes sense. Maybe, it isn't honesty, maybe it was pressure to get another novel done, maybe it's an honest effort to do something different (God knows, I get that)but it hopped all over and just wasn't, well, coherent most of the time. I still await the next no matter what. I trust."
3,Not RWW's best read,"But perfect if you're stranded all day in a freezing airport. I'll always read Randy's Doc Ford books because I love the settings, the characters, & I always learn something about our beautiful fragile Florida."
5,Suspenseful book!,I love buying used books in good condition and this one did not disapoint me.Now I can try other Randy Wayne White books as I know I enjoy them.
5,Great hardcover!,"The ""in Death"" books were published in paperback here until recently... I was able to find a seller in England who provided me with many of the older books in the series in hardcover, and was excited to find this one.Great Eve Dallas book - I have almost all of them, and love them!"
4,"Not original, but still great...","While the plot itself might not be an original idea, the spin Eve Dallas et al place on this story makes it 100 percent their own.When a criminal from Eve's past is released, a showdown between the two former enemies is all but certain. Will Roarke be injured in the ensuing battle? Who will the killer harm to get Eve's attention? How badly does she want revenge?We all know Eve isn't going to hide. She's not even willing to ""play it safe."" Typical to Eve Dallas, she meets this challenge head-on in a clash that will leave readers VERY satisfied."
4,Another enjoyable journey into Eve & Roarke's world,"The story was fast-paced as usual. Like in the last book, we know who is responsible for the murders it's just a matter of Eve and her team, including Roarke of course, outsmarting the criminal.There are some very important developments in Eve facing her childhood with a visit to Dallas, TX, which was told wonderfully and had you feeling every moment of not just her torment but Roarke's in seeing her deal with it and how it makes him feel.Of course the background stories involving the other characters were enjoyable. Peabody has her first homicide to investigate and her parents stop in to see her, which throws some interesting havic into Eve & Roarke's lives. Mavis & Nadine were not featured much in this book.Anyway, all said, it's a great book. I hope maybe the next book will go back to the unknown killer factor, as I enjoy that more, but the change of pace for the last two books has been nice too."
3,Poor Writing,I anxiously waited for 6 months for this title to come out and after reading it I just wasn't impressed. I LOVE Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb and I love the in Death series but this book didn't come close to the others. Eve seemed a little wishy washy in tis book and the secondary characters that play such a vital role in the other books have barely a page worth of dialogue in this book. Maybe she is pushing them out to fast or maybe there just really isn't anything left for Eve and Roarke to do that would be interesting. If you love the series you should read this title but don't get your hopes up it is not a good example of the fine writing that appears in the other titles in this series.
3,not as good as the earlier ones,"The earlier books in the series were great but these are getting predictable and tiresome. Don't get me wrong, I love the characters and there are some great scenes in here, but I think Robb should have stopped after Loyalty in Death."
1,Revenge Cop,"This is a book that spends more time on the psychological weaknesses of a police officer, who spends more time on her psychological problems than on her work. She is so self centered, that she sees nothing but her own importance. And instead of acting like a good police officer, she wants to end an arrest in hand to hand combat with a criminal. The author should take a lesson from one of the scenes in Indiana Jones when confronted by a sword wielding enemy, baiting him for combat, Indiana calmly shoots him. Eve Dallas should have let any of the swat time take out her enemy instead of playing gladiator. As with any book, no matter how boring, I read them to completion to fairly assess them. I did that to this waste of time book. This is my first encounter with Robb and she is certainly off my reading list of authors."
5,As good as it gets!,"I, like many EVE DALLAS fans, could hardly wait for this book. Once received, I never put it down until I finished it. In classic JD Robb (Nora Roberts) style Eve returns to thwart the vengeful murderer's plot to distroy what Eve and Rourke have built together. Peabody returns with her ever quick wit and is given an opportunity to show Eve she is a good cop. The introduction of Peabody's parents adds a little comic relief to keep the reader intrigued. Of course, Rourke shows more of his hidden talents as he teams up with his favorite cop. Eve again is required to allow cuts and bruises to be tended which gives the reader a chuckle. They have been married a year and they seem to be more comfortable with being at odds with each other. This is a must read - along with the rest of the series."
5,J D Robb,"I love the Eve Dallas series and this one doesn't disappoint! I love this author - either name - and would recommend to anyone who likes a good ""whodunit!"""
4,A little mushier than usual. . ..,"I've read almost every single J.D. Robb book, and love them all. However, even though i love this book too, our beloved Lieutenant Dallas seemed a little more vulnerable than usual. The Dallas scene was particularly heartbreaking, but she got physically hurt one too many times. What happened to the good old, ""Touch me and die!"" attitutde? THat and sometimes i got confused, like when Roarke mentioned his Dad. WHen the heck was his father in TX????"
5,Excellent Series,This book was yet another of J.D. Robb's excellent installments in the series of books featuring Eve Dallas and her sexy husband. The book has just enough action to keep you on the edge and yet manages that against romance and emotion that make you want to keep reading but yet dread the end of the book because then you will have to wait for the next volume to be released. Overall an excellent read.
3,Not what I needed.,"Although this book has wonderful detailed history on the breed and many, many good colour photographs, it lacked detail in the care of and specific health problems of Boston Terriers. Health was covered in only 4 pages of 176 and these pages had photos on half of each page. I wanted a book as an ongoing reference as my puppy grows, what to feed him, when and how to train him myself; a book that I would continue to use beyond knowing the history of the breed."
5,A Wealth of Information!,"Muriel P. Lee gives an excellent detailed history of the breed, from its beginnings in the late 19th century to the 1990's. This book contains hundreds of photographs of champion Bostons throughout the history. Additionally, the breed standards are described with some detail, as well as illustrations. The chapters on characteristics, showing, breeding and health deal specifically with Bostons. Information is provided on the Boston Terrier Club of America as well as regional breed clubs. It is an excellent reference for people who are looking for their first Boston as well as the experienced fancier!"
4,The Official Book of Boston terriers,"This is an excellant book for both the novice and experienced Boston Terrier fancier. The book defines the history and foundation stock of the breed with enough depth that a good understanding of the breeds development can be gained. Wonderful old photos of both Boston Terriers of days gone bye and their owners. In the contemporary section of the book we see a good cross section of the breed from both the US and around the world. Pedigrees, breed standards and grooming are all covered very well. The photo and text quality is supperb. Highly recommened to all lovers of BT's"
3,Great early George Winston... until the final track.,"There appears to be a manufacturing defect that causes errors reading back the last audio track. This is a ""hybrid"" CD, which contains DATA. That might be what's messing up the audio playback."
3,Hairdryer,"The on/off switch is inconveniently located on the handle so that when blow drying hair, it is easy to inadvertently switch off the dryer."
2,Dont waste your money,I didn't bother to return it. I think I may just donate it to the salvation army.It seems rather cheap and so I don't think it is worth putting on the wall.
3,Its Okay,It seems to be cheaply made and there is no way to keep dust etc from being sucked in- no filter to clean and replace. It does do its job but I am not sure for how long.
3,"Decent, no frills hair dryer","I would like to give this hair dryer 3.5 stars. I liked it enough that I bought a second one just like it, but only after the first one died after about a year's worth of daily use. We lack storage space in our small bathroom, so I needed a wall-mounted hair dryer. This one was simple to install and is very secure to the wall. It is simple to operate - since there are only three options - off, low, and high. I would have liked a cold air button, but that's too high-tech for this simple machine. But I obviously bought an exact replacement and will buy another one if this one goes. Luckily, they aren't that expensive."
5,Excellent Product,Excellent Product and I recommend this item to anybody. I take my time to do research and settled on this one. I'm very happy with my decision.
5,hangup hair dryer,"I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer. It is so convenient, no more digging for the hair dryer, it is ready and waiting. I would hate to be without this product, it makes my mornings run so smoothly! My teenagers love it too, it just couldn't be more handy. It has a lot of power and seems very much like a professional dryer."
3,Some fine Songs on a somewhat Gloomy Album.,"If you are a fan of Marianne Faithfull's early Island albums, there will undoubtedly be something of interest on this album too. Generally, there is something dark and gloomy over the album, and not all songs appear that memorable. However, there is enough solid material that justifies calling the album reasonably successful.Strongest in the picture are the more melodic songs such as ""Electra"", ""Wilder Shores of Love"" and ""Great Expectations"". In a class by itself, however, is the Leonard Cohen song ""Tower of Song"" - a fantastic song which Faithfull's interpretation provides full justice.Interestingly, of course, is the obscure Roger Waters song ""Incarnation of a Flower Child"""
5,Amazing and unique,I love the perspective the story is told from. I found it incredible and hard to out down. I highly reccomend this book.
2,Hmm...,"The story line is fairly interesting, but the constant flashback-within-a-flashback motif is really cumbersome, and the actual quality of writing is somewhat lacking. Also, attention to detail is lacking in simple things like punctuation and spelling."
3,I must of missed something.,"Yes, I enjoyed the book. It was a quick read. I don't understand all the gushing reviews. I did not find the book emotionally stirring. Nor did I find the writing that compelling. If you are looking for a great book on a soldier's journey in WWII -actually a pilot- I recommend ""In the Shadow of War"" by Childers. If you want a truly lyrical novel of a soldiers travails during war -in this case WWI- I would recommend ""A Soldier of the Great War"" by Helprin."
5,A Moving and Well Written First Book By A Phenomenal Long Island English Teacher,"This book was so well written and presented, it was a pleasure to read. I was not sure what to expect from Frank Nappi's first book; I was absolutely blown away by what I got. I must say, the ending is captivating; Not at all overdone or over emotional. Instead, it is realistic, heartfelt and flawless! The storyline was not even remotely extended, it was real, to the point and the pictures painted for us were clear and precise. Kudos to Frank Nappi and his first book. I'm now left anxiously awaiting book #2!!"
5,Couldn't put it down,"A dense, realistic story of the impact of war on a man and his family. Timeless in it's depiction of a father and son's struggle for love and understanding, the story will remain with you long after you read it. Well-written and very moving... you will not be able to put it down."
1,Does what its supposed to?,"I dont use it often but during the second time I was using it, the entire face plate slipped off, and the interior was exposed....SCARY!! This is an important device for me to have (WHEN I NEED IT), although not used often. I went cheap because of the low use/wear and tear I would put on it. If you need this daily/often....then take heade, you get what you pay for. Who knows how much longer it will work!?!"
3,"Did you say low budget, or no budget","Didn't expect much, and that's what I got. Good idea, not so good script. The acting was like watching an elementry school play, either that or just bad directing, take your pick. They should have got rid of some the zombies and paid somebody to write a better script. I get that you have to start somewhere, but sometimes your better off not starting at all.-It's watchalbe just don't expect much.-Rent it unless you can pick it up for a couple bucks somewhere.-Would I watch it again? Probably not."
1,STOP! - extreme animal cruelty!,I was very disturbed by the animal cruelty in this movie. There are numerous scenes in which animals are placed in scenes together and filmed while they fight to the death. The most disturbing is early in the film when a monkey is being filmed while it is being eaten alive by a snake. I threw my copy of this movie away and suggest you do the same. I'm all for horror movies but not at this expense.
5,A movie with no story,"There was only one quick shot of skin, the rest could be fast forward through. I gave the movie away."
3,Cannibal Film,"Ursula Andress' character and her brother, Arthur go to New Guinea to find her husband, who has been missing three months. They encounter an anthropologist who leads a jungle expedition to find the missing husband. They are captured by the Puka, a Stone Age tribe presumed extinct. The tribe is cannibalistic. Not as scary as Cannibal Ferox or the sound film making of Cannibal Holocaust, but worth a few for cannibal subgenre and horror enthusiasts."
2,DVD credits??,"Was this film the insperation for Bo Dereck's 'Tarzan the Ape Man?' The less said about both films, the better.However, my DVD version of this movie credits Derryl F Zanuck as producer, and Nobel Prize winning author--for Literature--William Faulkner as screenwriter. Neither is credited onscreen or at any website."
2,A little too gritty for the average viewer,"I love Ursula Andress and this film appeared to be a classic ""white goddess"" film. In those, like Bo Derek's ""Tarzan"", the heroine was tied up (for our delectation) while natives(cliche) hooted and hollered. Well, that IS about what this film is about, except unlike Hollywood, they show the natives as being pretty barbaric. While this might be more faithful to reality, it is not something I want to see. This is not a documentary. We want to see Ursula Andress(which we do somewhat) but not native witch doctors doing some very odd and disturbing things in the background. To the film makers' credit, they do warn us about what we might be about to view with the title, so be forewarned..."
2,meh,"This movie really doesn't have much going for it. It's funny in a sort of ironic 'how could this get any worse' kind of way, but it's not Joseph Lai bad."
1,Worst Movie Ever?,"What can I say about this movie?!? A rescue team sets out to find a woman's (Ursula Andress) husband. They spend most of the movie getting to a mountain top where her husband disappeared. Most of the rescue team is killed before they arrive (even Stacy Keach). Ursula Andress is stripped and covered with some red stuff (dye, blood, dead husband's goo??...who knows). Ursula escapes with the sole surviving man and they float down the river.No gruesome deaths (except perhaps a snake's). No real story line. And definately, no acting ability used in this film. It had NO redeeming qualities what-so-ever (unless you really want to see Ursula naked). Wish I could have given it no stars!"
4,Great Flick,"Good for the money...No animals were hurt,Just a movie..I hate PETA..A bunch of little men and homely women!"
1,Cannibal indegestion,"A bad movie on a good dvd. Service and product first rate, but the movie sucked."
1,Was ONCE a good film but.......,"This was a good movie but for the new DVD Anchor Bay have inserted some new scenes, most notably a cannibal raping a pig, and and it is VERY graphic and offensive. I would rather buy the foreign DVD or a bootleg copy of this movie, just to stay away from that damned pig raping scene!"
1,PETA Members Alert!,"This is a typical piece of Italian ""animal torture"" garbage! Please avoid purchasing this at all costs so that DVD companies will not reproduce this type of sadistic trash. This film demonstrates acts of animal cruelty that would make a Nazi grin with glee."
5,Goldsmith is ALWAYS entertaining,"This is a score from a fascinating, enthralling movie, and Goldsmith wrote a score that matches it. It entertains and captures you, keeping you thoroughlly entertained. Goldsmith was a master, and sorely missed."
5,I love it,"I really like this MP3-CD player. It has great battery life and playback. It also works nicely with CD-RW discs, and the grouping option is great. I've had mine for over a year without any signs of damage/breaking, even though I don't always treat it well. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a CD-MP3 player. Just make sure to use the hold switch (found on the bottom) so that it doesn't run for hours if a button is accidentally pressed."
1,"Worked for a week, then died!","After I bought this player, I put it on the shelf for a month or so, then opened it up. Bad idea. It died completely after only a week's use and, of course, Amazon's return period had gone by. The Sony name is no longer a guarantee of quality - they should change the model line from Walkman to Walk, man. Better yet, Run, man --- away from this product."
3,not for listening to music!,Well... i dont know about anything else.. but i dont recomend this for listening to music... the audio quality is bad... not as in the replace the head-phones... its bad as in built-in bad!! emm.... i listen to music on my computer and my ipod.. but with this cd player its noticably bad... second it has no remote.. yeah its cheap.. but i'd recomend going for more expensive ones... the battery life isn't that good.. and its annoying that the battery is the front cover.. you need to remove the cd to change batteries....
2,"Not for ""old eyes...""",Technically flawless with great sound. Battery life seems good also.LCD display is half the size of a postage stamp and unreadable for anyone over 40.The button labeling is simply slightly raised lettering in the plastic - WAY too small and the same color as the background.A good buy for 20/20 eyes.
3,worth it for the money,"I have owned maybe 8 portable cd players in my lifetime, most of them sonys. This is the cheapest one I've bought and I noticed the following right away:-it's pretty clunky-the viewing screen is tiny-it takes a long time from the moment you hit play to actually hearing music (alomost ten seconds)-The programing is really limited i.e. you can either listen to one song and it shuts off (haven't found a use for this yet) or you can shuffle. No repeating or programming that I can tell.And so far I haven't experienced anything positive with the actual design over previous models I've used. All things considered the sound is very comparable and that has outweighed the flaws. It has two bass boost settings and the first one is full sounding but not painfully bassyAlso the battery life is good. I would buy it again."
3,Not all that impressed.,"Typical made in China junk.The case is not as shown, but rather a bag with a drawstring enclosure. The bag is not only too small, it stinks of petrol as well.But otherwise, the 6ft cable looks pretty cheaply made, and the connectors seem to be hard to fit into some camera gear.However, it does have an 8 pin mini connector that will work with Nikon Coolpix cameras, which is the primary reason I bought the kit."
2,Bland but at least shiny,"The guide doesn't offer a great deal of content. Some nice shiny pictures, a lot of information rehashed from the game manual, a few good character ideas and a fairly good walkthrough. As some one who played this game way too much, it's clear the creators had only modest familiarity with the game just by the descriptions they offer for feats, items, etc. If you like having a walkthrough it does a solid job of that, but otherwise I found it mostly useless."
3,neverwinter nights: hordes of the underdark,"pros: very informative, good flow with the game story linecons: could have more information on the more involved areas of game play, needs more detailed maps of some areas"
2,The Editorial Description is Misleading,"There is no coverage of the Aurora toolset whatsoever in the book, the builder coverage was the only reason for my purchase of this book, I am very disappointed with what I received."
5,"Yep, there's really a TOI ET MOI.","Once again a transformative character is brought fully to life by Oscar winner and acting genius Marion Cotillard. The lesson of this film is how love, even if missed but accepted in oneself, can bring both authentic life and creative risk. The fun is the magazine TOI ET MOI really does exist in France, according to my French translator, and is quite popular. This makes Depardieu's character much more real. Cotillard, of course, disappears into the cellist; her cello work is great, too."
5,ONLY one Mistake,"My only mistake was thatI ""shoulda"" bought 2 or moreDelivery was:quickand FREE at that timeCurrentlyusing to splice 2 USB cables to get from computer on desk to printeralso can split at middle to allow quick access for 2 sonS' laptops (often)"
5,"Great book, even for a Portuguese speaker","Even though I am familiar with Portuguese, as a Brazilian expatriate in the USA, I found this book to be very useful. It highlights the cultural characteristics of the Portuguese people in a very concise and poignant way, and provides valuable insights into the culture, customs and mentality of the Portuguese people. This book is a great resource for anyone traveling, studying or even just traveling in Portugal, and should be on the reading list for anyone visiting Portugal."
4,truly funny,"Garner takes some of the most beloved childrens stories and turns them into the most perfect polically correct stories possible by removing any possibly offensive thoughts. In doing so, he has turned the idea of political correctness on its ear. By making the story as politically correct as possible, Garner has shown how stupid political correctness truly is. This book is not for the pollitically correct, but for those who want to needle them. Garner used different spellings of women to wommon so there wouldn't be a reference to men with women. He even apologizes in his introduction for not being politically correct enough. This is truly funny and the politically correct will miss the forest for the trees. Highley reccomended."
2,Amazon didn't advertise correctly,From the way it appeared on Amazon I was expecting to receive the full collection of Politically Correct stories. I only received one. There needs to be more product descriptions so I know exactly what I should be receiving.
4,The Hunt for Red October,"I think it was a very good book, the only parts I did not like was with the rescued sailor, but other than that I liked it, now onto the next book :)"
1,A Mind-Crushing Bore,"It's pretty hard to make a movie better than the book, but therein lies the problem with Clancy's The Hunt for Red October: he's a genius at laying out a plot, but then he makes the mistake of writing the story.The Hunt for Red October reads more like a dry government report than a thriller. Characters are cardboard vehicles of the action, nothing more. Clancy gets lost in describing the forensic details of every machine the characters go near, from fuel capacity to maximum range, regardless of whether they're relevant to the story. It's hard to bore me with a tale of espionage, international intrigue, and military adventure, but Clancy has done it. See the movie instead (rare advice). It has the depth and flow that the book lacks."
1,I don't understand the popularity of this book,"This is Clancy's first book, and it shows. He writes like someone who has never written before. His plot is clever, yet his writing is cluttered and slow. I felt like I was trying to read the instructions to program my VCR. It was slowed down by his constant acronyms (what do you think ASTDC stands for?) and technical language. I was so excited to read this book because of Clancy's reputation, yet now I will never read another one. A shame."
2,Clunk!,"The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks."
5,the hunt,"The Hunt for Red October was a great book, about the hunt for a submarine that had a new motor in it that ran on jet repulsion that made it move sliently and undetective. The US was trying to find it before it got to close the the coast, they were also trying to steal the thing to."
5,"Clancy at his rawest, simplest, and almost his best.","This book reads like the typical Clancy, but it's shorter, not as intricate, and that makes it even the quicker, more shallow, but entertaining plot. A sure must read!"
3,The first and still the best.,"I read it more than fifteen years ago, and it was good. Interesting deep sea adventure with the good old Russians causing havoc and threatening to desestabilize the world's order. Yeah, like we have not read anything like it before! What made it special then it was that it was a new author's first effort. This was Clancy's debut novel. And it looked so promising! It was a little heavy on descriptions and on incredible long background stories of some of the characters and that made the overall pace suffer.Unfortunately I feel that Clancy's later efforts are still trying to repeat this book's success, without even getting close. He has even resorted to ""Ghost writing"" with series as horrid as ""Net Force"".If you must read Clancy, ""Hunt"" is your best bet."
5,"A page-turner from the start, one of Tom Clancy's best","There are numerous good reviews on the site about the book and story about Red October so I will not repeat that. I have read all of Tom Clancy's novels in this series and this is probably one of his best works. If you can only read one or two of his novels, be sure to include this on your short list. Mr. Clancy has sprinkled in just enough Russian phrases to make the book come to life and you feel you are secretly hearing the Russians as they speak. A great story, read it."
4,Decent. Not awesome but decent.,"I thought that this book would be exactly like the movie. On that front i got screwed. But the whole idea is so realistic it is scary. Clancy can write this stuff so well that it is kind of wierd. If you read looking for the movie, you'll be dissapointed. Otherwise you'll love it."
4,"A great book, but don't see the movie first!","Clancy's first book is a winner, although the movie detracts from the military stigma this book provides. Read the book and then see the movie. It will make the movie all that more pleasureable! A winner for a first try!"
3,Book is awesome. Audiobook reader speaks too fast.,"This is a great book. If I had bought the written version, this review would be 5 stars. However, I bought the Audiobook. It isn't bad, but buyers be aware that the Audiobook's reader speaks very fast and does not use dramatic pauses. Even between scenes and chapters there is almost no pause. It almost seems that they were trying to rush through the book to keep the total size down to 2 discs vice having 3. The result: it is hard to follow at times. I frequently had to rewind and re-listen to segments to understand what is going on. Some buyers might like the pace, but I wish the reading speed was slower."
4,exciting but in depth,"This is yet another great book by Tom Clancy. This time Jack Ryan is involved in an underwater adventure that is sure to have you anxious to read on. A soviet submarine travels to the waters of the US and finds itself in a position to effectively attack. Jack Ryans guess at the scenario gets himself involved in a top secret mission dealing with a soviet commander which he had met in person. The only downfall to this book is that it is so involved with talking about submarines that unless you are interested or familiar with them, you may find it of less interest than others. Overall this is an excellent read that far surpasses the quality of the movie."
5,Clancy's First is Still His Best.,"As an Avid Clancy Fan, I have read, and reread, all of his books. The Hunt For Red October is still the one that gives the most thrills and chills. The research is great, with a gripping realism that grabs, and will not let go. The Plot is tight, with enough side trips to keep it interesting, but not obscure the main action. Marko Ramius is a well fleshed character, and Jack Ryan is a man to look up to in the modern era. The book is an astounding exercise in What if?, providing such realism, that you can certainly say, it could have happend. The presentation of life aboard a submarine is also first rate, givin a glimpse into a world that most of us will never have a chance to visit. Over all, with its unencumbered plot, absolute realism, suspensful finale, and wonderful characters, The Hunt for Red October is Clancy's greatest, a great read from start to finish. A fully earned 5/5 stars."
5,Hunt For Red October,"If you like action thrillers abou spying, the military, and submarines this book is definetly for you. This book is about a hunt for a Soviet sub with a drive system that is silent. The book encompasses submarine tactics and technology into action thriller. You think you would be bored reading about the inworkings of a submarine but your not. This book entertains you until the end."
3,To Be Or Not To Be,This was an average book at best. At parts it was the best book I have ever read at at other parts it was very boring. It is also confusing at parts. I agree with the guy that said that it was like trying to install a VCR - very confusing!(Very technical) Overall it is a pretty good read and worth your time on the most part.
2,The Hunt for my pillow...,"My friend (anonymous) recommended that I read this. BORING! She liked all the technical stuff. YEAH! That's ALL THERE IS! I also saw the movie version and it wasn't much better. When the sub is sailing into a harbor at night, the background looks SO FAKE! Read Gorky Park instead -- wicked good russian book."
2,Too much drivel,"I read the book after the movie and the movie is far, far better. There is too much ""fill in"" writing for my taste. The fill in is much too complicated for the average reader and to hard to follow and interrupts a flow in the story."
3,Later books are better,"Personally, I thought this book was pretty good, but I had read The Sum of All Fears before it, and that book is so much more intense than The Hunt for Red October. If you liked The Hunt for Red October, you gotta read some of the later books. If you didn't like Hunt for Red October, and don't mind a little techno-talk, get The Sum of All Fears. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Tom Clancy,Another great book but I tend to read extremlly fast and I found this to be a slow read but nontheless it was great
5,GREAT BOOK!,"""The Hunt for Red October"" is a Clancy's first and probaly one of his best novels. Tom Clancy takes readers on a amazing hunt for a missile submarine, Red October, in the North Atlantic. And in this novel, CIA Anylst Jack Ryan is introduced. Will the CIA and CIA Anylst Jack Ryan find the Red October in time to stop the missile-sub's captain's, Marko Ramius, plan to demolish the United States with missiles? Find out in Clancy's first and best novel."
3,CLANCY'S FIRST AND IT SHOWS,"I found the Hunt For Red October to be an interesting book but it's hardly the best in the Jack Ryan series. It's true that the technical aspect of the book is dead on but there is a certain something that can be found in Without Remorse and Patriot Games that is absent in this novel. Good, but not great."
3,CD set Hunt for Red October,"This is one of my favorite books- and I am not disappointed in the story-I give that a 5. However, there is an annoying aspect to the recording for this audio book, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating overall. There are many instances of speed skipping on the sound--you can understand all the words okay, but there are many that go fast like a skipping record. I am not sure if it's just my copy, or all of them, as this annoying speed skipping occurs on all discs in the set. The speed of the recording may have be upped to shorten the number of discs--and the recording company just pushed it a little too far--I dont' know. If you like Tom Clancy's work, and you want an audio version,this is still good."
1,Not collectible,"This item was listed as a collectible. It was anything but collectible. It is a used library book. It has the plastic cover, library stamps on the edges, and card holder in the back. The binding is frayed, and pages are starting to fall out. This should be listed as a used book not a collectible."
1,The Hunt for Red October.,Cold War time propaganda... starting from the first page.I openly dislike it... waste of time and money for myself.
1,He's the Man for His Time and Place,"Clancy's first and most famous novel is a classic. And I don't mean that in a nice way. The story displays complete ignorance of Russian military culture; the dialogue is unworthy of cartoon characters; the ""action"" is a far-fetched excuse for long pedantic discourses on weaponry lifted from the pages of Jane's and Aviation Week; and the author is a draftdodging hypocrite rightwinger who somehow elected not to fight in Vietnam and spent the rest of his life becoming enormously rich lecturing fellow cowards on the wonders of modern warfare. In short, it's the perfect book for the American electorate. You go girls!"
1,Boring...,"If you want to know everything of submarines, here is your chance. Learn all the technical ins and outs and get a crash course in tactical warfare.However, if you want an action-packed thriller do not open this book. I found that most of it are descriptions of endless underwater trips. However, it is good if you want to go to sleep at night."
4,The most incredible chase in history is on!,"THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is still one of the best books ever rated. The amount of detail is astounding, and although the plot is a bit linear and it practically telegraphs what's going to happen (a flaw with all his books) very few authors can hold your attention like Clancy can"
4,Breakout hit Clancy's best,"The great thing about this book and what seperates it from all other of his books is two things really. First every page is exciting there aren't any pages you would want to skip, and second the technical jargon is tolerable. This was his breakout hit and I can see why it's 400+ pages is pure excitement. He also introduces a true American hero. An average every man kind of guy named Jack Ryan. This book epitomizes what a thriller should be."
5,Realistic Detail in a Fantasic Story,"My favorite of the Tom Clancy series! He tells the story of a rogue captain of a cold-war Russian submarine so well, I was sure it really happened. Clancy's knowledge of US and Russian government and military is very thorough and makes for a good read all the way through. Rich with sub-stories surrounding the main event, this one is hard to put down!Regarding the book itself, it is a nice hard copy with a new slipcover. Well-bound and typeset such that even tired eyes find comfortable to read."
5,The Hunt for Red October,"I find the book and movie are very different but the book is worth reading. More detail is involved, more suspense keeping you reading on and on."
3,It's all about SUB chasing..,"I don't know why everyone regard this book as one of the best thriller. How it can be a thriller when the plot of the story is really straight forward. This book is all about US sub chasing Soviet Sub. Believe me, you don't have to read the whole book to know what will happen to poor Soviet Sub.."
1,Great action,Probably the best book Clancy ever wrote. He does a great job of detailing the story without becoming verbose. Exciting readin.
2,Top and Bottom,"It's hard for me to rate this book. I thought the story was exciting and probably deserves a 5. I thought that reading Clancy's dull, flat, monotonous sentences, which plodded on for more than 600 pages, was torture. I simply could not subject my mind or my spirit to this drudgery. The author does not love language: he has no concern for words, sentences, sentence structure, or variety. I skimmed this book as fast as I could, just for the story. I would have to give the writing a 0. Even though I liked the story, I have never read another Clancy book."
5,"Review of ""Hunt for Red October""",The Hunt for Red October (Jack Ryan)I liked the movie in the first place and I wanted a copy of the book. The used book was almost new and the cost was very reasonable.
5,hard to put down,"great story..clancys way of putting naval jargon in laymens terms is wonderful..interesting later cold war chess match, with the US weary of Russia and vice versa..i look forward to reading the whole saga in order"
1,Disappointing,"I wonder why defectors are heroes in the eyes of Tom Clancy? He curse people trying to cheat US but eulogizes people running to US. Morality is lost somewhere along the way. Defector is a defector, it is treason and stealing property of the state is a bad act. Your moral judgement is just plainly wrong here.People do have pride for their motherland and this book is just very disrespectful toward Soviet Union."
1,tom clancy is a jerk,Too bad Clancy never learned to think or write. Check the latest edition of Smithsonian Magazine for his thoughts on the death of JFK. He was upset about missing the Colts game on TV! And we're supposed to pay for his books?
1,The Hunt for Red Cherries,"OK, George W. Bush is president of the US of A. That's fine. But Mr. Alec Baldwin promised to move to Canada if Bush won. Baldwin has yet to move his ever-growing rear to Winnipeg. I suggest that you refrain from buying this book or the movie, starring Alec Baldwin as Admiral Smirnoff, until Alec moves to the Great White North. Speaking of which, a war between Canada and the US would be a great idea for Clancy's newest book; unless he is too busy briefing Regan (Ray-gun) about US military capability.""We can destroy them, Mr. President!""""What?""""Mr. President, we have big bombs!""""Who are you?""""Tom Clancy, Mr. President!""""Get out of the White House, mister!""""This is your ranch in California, Mr. President!""""I want more Jello(tm)! Nancy!"""
4,Excellent read.,I happened to be part of this type of search. It brought back many memories. This is a well written mostly (although fiction) book. would recommend to anyone.
5,Incredible.,"This is one of those few books that you can call an ""edge of your seat"" book. The atmosphere and the writing all play into the style of total intensity and nail-biting terror. Some might find it hard to get past all the technicalities, but this book is a must read."
4,I strongly advise you to read this book,"I liked this book a lot, partially because I like books about the military, and this book reads like a lot of books I have about naval warfare, especially ones that describe things like battles or campaigns. Although Tom Clancy sometimes overdoes it on the technobabble, and the book gets slow from time to time, there is really nothing that I dislike about it.It is about a Russian captain who suddenly disappears along with his brand new missile sub, and the subsequent search by both the U.S. and Soviet navies to try to find it again.I have not read any other Tom Clancy books (not yet, anyway), but if they are even half as good as this one, I understand why he is one of the most succesful authors.I really think that if you like exciting and/or suspenseful books, or even if you just like books about the military, you should buy this book right now, instead of wasting your time reading this review!"
4,Enthralling story of the Cold War.,"Tom Clancy has brought another dimension to the techno-thriller: believabilty. If you have seen the movie, then you have absorbed 90% of this book. The story of a submarine captain who realizes that his new sub is to powerful for just one country to have.If you enjoy Clancy's other novels/movies, then get this book to more fully understand the whole Red October story. If you only have a passing interest in techno-thrillers, stay with the movie."
4,Foolish Pride,I entirely enjoyed this book and am I dedicated follower and Tom Clancy. The story adopts a role of two submarines chasing each other through the depths whilst a Russian surface fleet hunts them both down. The storyline of the book is well staged and adequately researched. Once again Tom Clancy has proved that he has the ability to captivate an audience.
5,A big powerful novel!,Clancy really did take us all by storm. This novel is the best techno-thriller I have read so far!
3,Estonian dance metal,"Vanilla Ninja is an Estonian band consisting (at the time of this release) of four female members. Largely unknown in the West, they have achieved some success in Eastern Europe. On this album, the sound was dominated by the producer, who was aiming for a blend of gothic metal and dance music. This in fact is what they achieved, although the results are rather mixed. The music comes across as more original than on most dance-oriented CDs. However, mainly because of the repetitive disco rhythms, this band is not the same league as other European female-fronted metal bands, such as Nightwish or Within Temptation. After this CD was released, the band split from their producer, and moved in a more metallic direction."
3,"OK book, but no real added value","This book is OK, nothing sensational and nothing awful.The recipes are, for the most part, simple. In fact you would expect them to be given the focus of the book. However, some of them border on the simplistic and boring. You don't really need this book to know you can make fried chicken in an iron skillet do you? Because if you do than you need a book that will cover the basics, perhaps Julia Child's 'The Way to Cook'.There are some nice variations of known recipes and the book is a nice touch as a sidekick if you give to someone their first cast iron skillet (which everyone should have in their kitchen)."
5,"Excellent, excellent cookbook!","I feel this is an excellent, excellent ""comfort food"" cookbook. Many fine recipes reside in here, and the recipe on page six alone is worth the price of admission! ""Dutch Babies"" allow even a novice cook to feel like a Master Chef! And have your camera ready, 'cause when this thing comes out of the oven, IT IS GORGEOUS! And it tastes as good as it looks! If ever I lose this book, or someone makes off with it(!), I will definitely be replacing it..."
2,Not so much....,"I got this book and am pretty disappointed. The recipes aren't bad, but I was hoping for more pictures and more camper friendly recipes."
5,I love cast iron cooking!,"I think this is a very easy to use book, great pictures and recipes. Glad I bought a gift for myself!"
3,its ok,After reading the other reviews I had higher expections. I have several old sothern cookbooks that have been past down through the years and they are so much better than this one. I suppose if I didn't have them to compare too then this book would meet my needs.
5,Focused cookbook,Purchased two of these cookbooks to go with cast iron skillets given as shower presents. We love our cast iron skillet and the cookbooks were a perfect accompaniment to the skillets for first time users. The books had great tips for the care and use of the skillet and also supplied lots of interesting recipes go get a cast iron skillet cook started.
5,The ultimate cookware,".The introduction of the book is dedicated to cast iron pan itself; selection, care and use. The rest of the book is recipes that use the cast iron pan. With cast iron, all you need is the basics to get started and lots of practice.The soda bread recipe brought me back to my childhood in grandma's kitchen, that alone is worth the price of this book.My favorite recipe was the Rose-Mary Crusted Rack of Lamb, and there are several others."
2,Overrated,"Only a few good recipes and photos at best. Great price, so I guess you get what you pay for. Not for those who are more visual."
1,too complicated,Cookbook is simply too complicated. It does have very good information on care ofcastiron skillets. The recipes are not practical for an 80 year old couple.we found none in the book for us. I sure would like to get rid of it.
3,Okay Book,"After reading the reviews I was expecting more..It's an okay book,if I'd viewed it before hand I would not have purchased it though. Oh,well.."
3,So-so...,"I was kind of surprised when getting this, as the cover seems like it is color laser copied from an original... kinda fuzzy. It is professionally bound, and the recipes are clear. I have not made anything from it yet, so I will follow up. If you are an Art-fart like me, you will be disappointed by the image quality."
2,The Cast Iron Skillet Cookbook: Recipes for the Best Pan in Your Kitchen,"The book had some great recipes in it, but unfortunately it was not the kind of cookbook I was looking for at this time. I wanted a cookbook that would give merecipes that could be prepared over the open campfire. We have a permanent camp site and do a lot of cooking over the open fire. All the recipes called for bakingin an oven. What was cooked on a stove was not the type that I would be able toconvert to use a campfire.I have returned the cookbook and at this time I will continue to look for that typeof book."
2,Don't waste your money,This has a collection of weird recipes with weird ingredients. Whoever put this book together is not a cook and will never be one...Stay away....
5,"It's bloody brilliant, ya wag!","It's brash, it's trippy, it's violent, and it's very, very literate. Grant Morrison has definitely pushed the envelope of comic-book storytelling with this one. With fascinating, well-drawn (pun intended) characters, a tight narrative, and references I still don't get after the third read, it's a great read. Beware- this isn't for the narrow-minded."
5,Nice and smooth.,"This may not be the ideal representation of it, but the Invisibles is agreat comic novel. Sure, everyone knows the stereotype of comic books: big guys in tights hurting each other.But this is so much more. Transexual shamen hurting otherdimensional insect-armour women! Nectar-sucking bemasked other-dimensional dwarves!And quite possibly the first story to contain both John Lennon and the Marquis DeSade in plot-advancing roles.If you enjoy this particular chunk of the story, it gets better both plot-movement and art-wise in the later issues, which should be reprinted in trade format soon.Entropy in the UK is particularly good, and the second volume is starting any day now. Bloody Hell in America indeed."
2,Love It or Hate It,"The Invisibles starts off promisingly but quickly becomes chapter after chapter of Alice in Wonderland on sex, drugs, violence and some cod philosophy. For those who like meandering explorations into the dark (read: lots of text and allusions) over a coherent storyline, then the Invisibles may be your cup of tea. Grant Morrison isn't a bad writer but he's never quite knocked me out like Alan Moore has. There are traces of this being a wanna-be Watchmen, and I think this story could have done with more soul. As it is, it's an open ended bloody mess - something I suspect the authors meant it to be. This is not an easy read or even a worthwhile read in some respects. I think I'm chucking out my copy."
2,Let the invisibles disappear,"I made some mistakes in my early review; the main one being that the fifth Beatle was not Peter Finch but Pete Best (Peter Finch was a popular actor in the 1960s and JFK's brother-in-law). However, I still would like to go on the record and say that this is not Grant Morrison's best work. The Invisibles: Say You Want a Revolution is just way too hip for it's own good (I feel the same way about Warren Ellis'Transmetropolitan: Back on the Street). A much better work along the same lines (and also by Grant Morrison) is Doom Patrol: Crawling from the Wreckage. In the Doom Patrol it works for the characters to be strange and weird, that's who they are. However, in the Invisibles, the characters' oddities just seem forced. Stay away from the Invisibles and get the Doom Patrol, because the Doom Patrol is what the Invisibles should have been."
1,"Vile, boring, and pretentious","There's no point in giving this series a bad review. Much like the ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" movies, you're either in to this kind of vile, hate-filled garbage, or you're not. But if you're the kind of person who LIKES the glorification of murder, theft, child rape, arson, book-burning and so forth, then this is definitely the series for you."
5,Learn to stay invisible!,"This unbelivable work brutally blends paranoia, conspiricy, sex, magic, time travel, good vs. evil, and everything else people are too squeamish to believe.If you love the X-Files, science-fiction, modern occult studies, or James Bond films...Check this out--and learn to stay invisible!"
4,Love this book.,"If you are a fan of Jennifers's books, you have already been wondering as you read them what the quilts described in them look like. Some of you very experienced at quilting probably have the pictures of quilt blocks in your mind. However, if you are not that experienced, this book not only gives you the pictures, but gives you easy to follow directions so you can follow with your favorite characters in fiction to create your own blocks and quilts. I also enjoy the character reviews that Jennifer adds for each quilt so you can refer back to the book in which the quilt was first introduced."
4,Elm Creek series,Really enjoyed this series ..... lots of variety in the lives of the main characters .......
5,Awesome! Just.....different,"Para mi esta disco es muy difícil para comprarar al lado de los dos anteriores, porque cada disco de esta grupo tiene sabor diferente, una cosa de bastante importancia por esta grupo muy eclectico. Se esconde entre las canciones sentido mas maduro, sino tanto libre como los primeros exitos. Las letras son mas de introspección pero no se perdieron la felicidad y alegría por la vida. Como siempre, LODVG usan sonidos diferentes para comunicar su corazón por música, y hablan al corazón cuando usan palabras o no. Las canciones son muy buenas; mis favoritos son Rosas, una recuerda y esperanza de días pasados, y Un Mundo Mejor, un poquto mas pesada pero muy atentado a como piensan y vivan la gente en nuestro mundo. Tambien, la trac bonus (15) es simplimente divertida con su ritmo de ""dance,"" y letras caprichosas."
4,"Really cute, good music.","I love this CD just because the lead singer's voice is amazingly beautiful and unique. =] Aside from that, the CD is unique itself and generally gets everybody in a good mood while listening to it. I recommend this CD to anybody who likes spanish pop rock. It's definitely buyable."
2,Aunque duela,"Este nuevo CD de LODVG es casi igual a sus otros CDs. La verdad, pienso que muchas de sus canciones se parecen y que algunas otras no tienen sentido. Este CD esta demasiado largo, te aburre depues de las primeras 5 canciones. Nada mas hay dos canciones que valen la pena, Rosas y 20 de enero. El CD, y me duele decirlo, es poco menos que mediocre. Pero como grupo, LODVG tiene varias canciones muy buenas, y me parecen muy creativos. Este CD no es de sus mejores cosas. Recomiendo cualquiera de los dos anteriores para los que no quieran malgastar su dinero."
2,Una radioformula mas,"Creo que no hay mucho que decir de este album (y de este grupo) mas que son una radioformula mas. Canciones claramente hechas bajo los patrones del comercialismo, de letras senciallas y estribillos pegajosos para que las radioestaciones las pongan al aire hasta rayar el disco. Creo que no aportan nada nuevo al panorama musical espanol. Si quieren escuchar algo innovador y relamente con sustancia, recomiendo a Amaral, sus discos Amaral y Estrella de Mar son realmente buenos musicalmente y tambien en cuanto a letras."
2,Empalagooooooso,"LODVG hace un pop fácil y dulzón, que para mi gusto pierde la frescura que podría tener a causa de la mega-hiper-exagerada producción que aplican a sus canciones. Esto hace que su sonido sea excesivamente comercial y oculta a menudo el mérito de algunas de sus canciones. Se les va la mano (a ellos o a su productor) y es una lástima; pero a ellos parece que lo único que les importa es vender como rosquillas.Por ciero, que las canciones en sí tampoco me enamoran. Son correctas, pero falta chispa en las melodías, y las letras son irregulares: alguna interesante y varias horriblemente ñoñas y estúpidas. Le doy un 3 sobre 10."
1,Puaghh,"This Cd is really bad. The songs are so tipically... it sounds chunky, maybe they are repeating themselves, her music is always the same."
2,SOMEBODY WAKE ME UP!!!...ZZZZZ,"I fell asleep whit this cd. I can say ""Puedes Contar Conmigo"" ""Vestido azúl"" and "" Perdóname"" are great songs, the rest are...aaahummm...zzzzzzzzzzz.....buy it if you have some troubles with your sleep."
3,Rock??? hummm....,"Acabo de regresar de España y es increíble el éxito que tiene éste grupo allí, se escucha todo el día y a cualquier hora por la radio y en la TV su video dá vueltas una y otra vez, especialmente la canción 'Rosas' su segundo single luego de 'Puedes Contar Conmigo' que fue el primero.No sé a que llaman ROCK los españoles; pero les aseguro que de Rock esta banda NO TIENE NADA, NADA DE NADA.Sus letras son un tanto ""cursi"" (snobbish, a la Robbie Williams in the UK) dichas de una manera que NADA TIENE QUE VER CON EL VERDADERO ROCK ESPAÑOL, que sí hay en España, pero que ésta banda nada tiene que ver con eso. Es más bién un Pop blando lleno de ""cursilería"", aunque debo admitir que su música es realmente muy pegadiza y contagiosa, pero NO ES ROCK.Música entretenida, para regalarle a alguna noviecita ilusionada, nada mas que eso: BUEN POP CURSI.(if you like The Cranberries, you'll enjoy this band). ><((((>"
2,WOULD HAVE been great if.......,"We received this item as a gift. I would agree with the other reviewers that this item is even better looking in real life than online. However, the clear lid on this is made of plastic. Unfortunately, the plastic was cracked when we received it. Since we liked it so much, we sent out for a replacement. The replacement had the same problem. We were going to give it one more try, however were told this was a widespread problem and they couldn't send us another but rather had to give us store credit. In summary, lucky you if you receive a non-defective item -- you will be pleased with your purchase. On the other hand, if you aren't so lucky, have fun getting the issue resolved. It has been a month and we still haven't gotten our store credit."
3,Birth certificate w/ curl & tooth box,The ends do not stay on the tube very well. Cute if you are going to put away in storage - not for display
5,excellent product a angels request,This product is the best that I have seen for a baby yet Iam 39 years old and have 2 children one out of high school and working on the third child and I feel really blessed to have this type of baby product for my new born baby when it comes. Thanks to the maker for such a great idea it is heaven sent..
4,"Nice, but over priced","We received this item over two years ago as a gift for our first born. The boxes that hold the curl, tooth, & birth certificate are great, and I feel like the birth certificate especially is sealed in there pretty well when we close it in. I went searching the same keepsake box for our second child, and was surprised to find it priced over $50. The box itself seems to be built a little cheap. There's possible Styrofoam underneath the silk, and the lid doesn't close/seal completely, & is held together by a tiny magnet. I could have made something like this in wood shop in High School. Aside from that, it over all is very cute, still very sturdy, and obviously I liked the product enough to go searching for it years later."
1,"Great product, poor vendor","When I received this item from Bravofun, the glass was broken due to poor packaging. I called their number and left a detailed message. After not hearing anything back, I called several more times, but no one ever picked up the phone. After several days, I contacted Amazon Customer Service and was able to return the product through them and got a full refund. I would not recommend using Bravofun. I re-ordered the item through Baby Gift Idea. I received my order quickly, packaged appropriately and there was no damage to the product. I would definitely order again from Baby Gift Idea."
2,DAMAGED BIG TIME!,I ordered this product two times and both times they came damaged. The lid was craked and i was very disappointed. The box in a whole was beautiful but i couldnt give either one as a gift and had to return them!
