5,THE BEST TNE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE MOVIE THAT DISNEY MAKE IS WONDERFUL. MY KID WACTH OVER AND OVER FOR SO MANY TIMES. SHE WACTH WITH HER FRIENDS AND THEY ACT AS MULAN , FOR US TO WACTH. MY KID ASK ME BUY HER ALL MULAN'S THINGS. SHE LIKE MULAN VERY MUCH. I'M VERY HAPPY THAT I BUY HER A TAPE OF MULAN. I GIVE MULAN 5 1/2 HALF STAR FOR THE MOVIE. I NEVER GIVE THIS HIGH BEFORE FOR ANY MOVIES. THE BEST MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I READ THE REVIEW WRITE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEPEOPLE GIVE LOW MARK. I HOPE ALL THE REVIEW READ MINE. I HOPE I HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU."
3,Not one of Disney's best but somewhat good!,"This movie is not one of Disney's best, for one reason, the songs are bad, they are not memorable. So I can't give this 5 or 4 stars. But is this supposed to be funny, it had gotten an Academy Award Nomination for Best Orignial Musical or Comedy Score - Matthew Wilder, David Zippel, Jerry Goldsmith. Both those nominations is what this movie doesn't have or does depends on who you ask. Is Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy) funny? If you want to see or hear Eddie Murphy be funny, watch Shrek or another comedy movie. If fact, if you want to watch this rent it, don't buy this film, buy Shrek instead."
3,It's supposed to be a beautiful film......,"I love the movie and the story. But, we forget how visually stunning the movie was. Being a designer/special effect artist I watch how the beautiful scenery was chopped up to fit in the NTSC format. That means, it was formatted to fit in the television viewing area. The stunning asian color palette was less dramatic and the scenes were, not as powerful as they should be. I was hoping for a special widescreen version, however Disney still does not make any of their beautiful animations in that format. I have to give the video 3 stars because we're just seeing half the film."
3,a well done but biased movie,Disney did produce a beautiful movie from long ignored asian culture. But this movie also oversees the Chinese aggressively militant past and presence. This makes many viewers take China for peaceloving country. This movie also defame the Turk nation ( whose ancestor is Hun ) as barbarian and aggressive. But the truth is peopele in East Turkistan is currently under brutal rule of communist China and never stop seeking independence and freedom.
3,Good story and cultural glimse.,"This is a story that the whole family liked and we watched it several times, but then interest waned. My little ones will go through phases of watching a new disney movie to dead, then it wanes to ""periodic"". This one was never an obsession for anyone in the family, not has anyone asked to see it lately.I thought the problems might be the medium coloring, but they watch the ""power puff girls"", and disneys worst isn't ever close to being that bad. I also didn't care for the digtal imaging job that was done... almost as if it was rushed. I thought the action was good and the characters interesting, so I think it was the music. The music here is mediocre to bad. The music can make a big difference. What would the Hunchback of Notre Dame be without that wonderful music!"
4,Pretty Good,"This is definatly a good Disney that deserves to be remembered. It doesn't follow the traditional story-line of Disney movies. It is new and creative. It ditches the romance and features a female heroine that actually is a hero. She saves China! Another thing is, this is the only animated movie my 11-year-old brother likes. Quite an accomplishment. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it lacks the traditional music that all Disney movies posses. There are some songs but they aren't very memorable. But, overall, this is a wonderful Disney film that should be treasured for many years to come."
3,Allright,"This movie was ok. Mulan was a good character, full of animation and beauty. She was a good person and was learning a lot by her experiences but she didn't understand some things which her father tried to teach her. A good movie, some of the scenes would have been better without Mushu talking about spit shines and stuff like that. But very interesting. If Mushu weren't in the movie I probably would have cried."
3,entertaining but not really authentic in look,"Although ""Mulan"" entertained me, the movie didn't have a Chinese look to it. I read somewhere that the animators had gone on a trip to China to do research for this movie. I thought that they must have gone to Japan instead of China. I know I am not supposed to look for authenticity from Disney, but I had imagined that the design would look more Chinese. And the colors were too pastel. However, the computer animation of the Huns riding down the hill was pretty impressive- it looked so realistic. The songs were not very memorable but the worst song was the training song whose title I can't remember. I did like the strong herione role instead of the usual Disney heroine who is always searching for romance."
3,***(good KID fun),this is a film that will stun you as far as the visual look goes but the screen play is not all that good . this also deals with a topic that showes no solied back round and as a grad of NYU film school it insluts my good tast in film disny should be ashamed!!!!!!!!
5,Ethnic Herione to be proud of.,"In a world where violence is so prevalent, Mulan is a refreshing change. There were some fight scenes, but I didn't have to cover my three year old daughter's eyes. It is also great that my daughter can see a heroine with the same color skin as she and the same slanted eyes that she has. Congrats Disney for such a fine film. I'll be buying the video and watching it with my daughter!"
5,My Favorite Disney Movie!,"HI. I like this movie because a lot of times I feel like Mulan. I just wish I had her guts! I like this movie because of the cool songs, and the fun charictures like Mushoo....(or however ya want to spell his name.) I just like this kinda movie. I got it for my 14th birthday from my dad and mom. And when I can I watch it. Of course I drive my brother nuts with singing all the kewl songs. Because they'll get stuck in HIS head and I would be walkin' past him and he'd be singin them. But this is defenently one of my most favorite movies. And you'd miss out if you didn't get it, and watch it. So see ya around!"
1,not what i thought i was buying,i did not see anywhere on the details for this dvd that it was in manderain!! i was informed buy the seller on how to change it to English but i could not even get the dvd to play in order to do that. i can play every other dvd i own but the foreign one i bought by acctcident wont even load. go figure!
3,Not New,"The movie was listed as new but I am honestly not sure if it was or not. It was very evident it was not in manufacturers packaging at least, it had probably a good 6 in. of extra plastic wrapping hanging off of a very loosely wrapped movie box. My daughter is happy and it plays fine so that is why I gave it 3 stars instead my initial thought."
5,Mulan,"Great picture, Great sound, I was amazed that a movie can look as good as does on the big screen. I also loved having a movie time with my granddaughter and watching a girl be the hero. She loved this movie and I take it as a hit when she yells ""hold it grandma"" so she can scramble off the couch and get a drink and not want to miss a minute. Well we own the movie and we have seen it over and over and its great to have Mulan on our movie list."
3,"Enjoyable, But Not A Disney Classic","Upon its release, ""Mulan"" was seen as an improvement over the relatively-forgettable ""Hercules"". And rightly so. That said, it falls short in comparison to the earlier Disney films of the decade. The songs are subpar, the animation lacks the elegance of ""Beauty and the Beast"" & ""The Little Mermaid"", and the characters are anything but memorable. I applaud Disney for the story (yes, I know it's based on a Chinese legend), but that's about it. Thankfully, Disney resumed to top-notch animation a year later with ""Tarzan"". ""Mulan"", on the other hand, belongs more to the films they released in the 2000s: they're enjoyable but lack the oh-so-famous magic of their real classics."
4,Glad there is another Disney storyline,"I loved Mulan. The little Asian family jokes were hilarious! Frying dumplings over an open fire with chopsticks. Ingenious. The little details of humor are what made this movie so much fun to watch. I'm glad the main story line wasn't about love. A nice relief of traditional animated movies (Pocohantas, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc...), though I've always loved Disney movies. Q: the dog's name is little brother, is that just a translation from the chinese word for little brother?"
4,Love It,"Being a Chinese, I really appreciate the efforts put into this movie. Most of the movie is accurate to the old tale that my mother told me when I was a young girl. Especially Mulan's strive to prove that she could be more than just a helpless girl waiting to be married into a wealthy family. This story has been staged in many Chinese operas. Mom's version has it that nobody discovered Mulan's true identity until the captain decided to visit Mulan after the war.Naturally mom's version did not include a wisecracking dragon, but it was a welcome addition. The up-to-date jokes made it an easier story to comprehend."
4,The most delicious waffles!!!,"We received this waffle iron as a wedding gift in 1998 and it is still going strong! Makes the best waffles -- crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. Would have given it a full 5 stars, but as with any waffle maker I've ever encountered -- it is not super easy to clean, but that is only when you pour too much batter in and it overflows."
2,"Great product, while it lasted!","This product was a gift and made wonderful waffles for a year and a half ... and then it just quit working... I always thought of Krups as being a quality product, but this one had too short a life... I would not recommend purchasing this product."
3,Pass on this One!,"I cannot recommend purchasing this product.It worked OK for about year or so and then it just quit working. Also it's very difficult to clean. Krups recommends just wiping it off with a paper towel ! Would you just wipe off your dishes, cookware, etc. and put them back in your cabinets?Batter leaks onto the outside and into the crevices where it's nearly impossible to clean off. Also leaks batter all over the countertop. My experience with this product and a Krups Aroma Time Auto Coffee maker will steer me away from purchasing any more Krups products."
1,Great until it quit,One of the greatest appliances I've owned due to small size and easy storage and cleaning. But it just died and quit working before it was 4 months old.
1,Fine While It Worked,"Using Customer Reviews and advertized features as a guideline, we purchased the Krups 653-75 Waffle Chef in February of 2001. On September 15,2001, in the middle of making waffles, it stopped dead with a half-baked waffle and a breakfast ruined. Others may have better luck; we did not. Since we love Saturday morning waffles, we will buy another Belgian Waffle Maker, but probably not Krups."
2,Beware: this one has a bug in it.,I bought this model of waffle maker some time ago and it worked swell for about 2 years until one day it just stopped working for no apparent reason (I wouldn't say I used it heavily either. Maybe once every few weeks). I see from other reviewers here that I am not the only one who has had this experience. Customers would probably be better off choosing a waffle iron that will last longer.
1,Caution!,"Beware of these books. If you are looking for supplemental reading for your Nancy Drew lover, beware. These books are highly inappropriate for the typical Nancy Drew lover. Content is not only ""inappropriate"" for the pre-teen crowd, but the vocabulary and content is flooded with sexual undertones intermixed with poor values. I was floored to find that these books were being marketed to the Nancy Drew reader. Many naive parents who purchase this series would be quite surprised at their content. Do you really want your child to be reading how Nancy Drew ""sexily smiled"" at a stranger? Parents who fondly remember days snuggled up under the cover with a good Nancy Drew book will randomly pick up this series expecting the same good mystery and wholesome read. It causes me to pause and ponder what other deceptions publishers are using to exploit our children. Read one yourself and decide if you are not being fooled into thinking your children are just reading another ""good book."""
1,disapointing,"The lion king 1.5 is better, I felt like this was a waste of money. This movie is a little dark for little ones"
3,"It is entertaining for kids, but, not as good as the original Lion King","The original Lion King although designed for kids, has an interesting plot and the movie moved into that direction. Th Lion King 2 is entertaining for kids, but it is a not quite at the same level of the original. The kids will generally enjoy it, but will get bored with this film much sooner."
5,The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride..,This is an awesome movie. the lion king 2 is one of the best animated sequels since Aladdin return of jafar. this is a great movie. all your favorite characters are back and better than ever. this movie is great for the whole family. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
4,Good Movie,"It is a good movie. I don't like the music as much as the first. It has a good message to send about family, and come on it's The Lion King!"
4,Hard to find,This movie is hard to find on regular shops so it's nice to get it from online shopping. A great sequel to the classic
2,Skips,"Very disapointed to open the video only to find out that it skips. My daughters, who have had to wait months for this for their birthday, was very diapointed! Not to mention me, who paid over double the retail price. Now, what to do with this?????"
1,The Lion King 2-The DVD that never came,Never received my item. Was a birthday present and daughter still asks where it is. Sent to email's to the seller and received no response. Will never buy from them again.
4,One of The Best Disney Sequals,"I was very impressed with this sequal. I'm usually not very impressed with disney sequals, but this one was actually pretty entertaining. It had very good music, which is very rare for a Disney sequal. I liked the music so much that I bought the CD. The storyline is also resonable. One of the better things is the animation which is also very good. Overall this was one of Disneys best sequals, and that is why I gave it 4 stars."
2,A disapointing sequel to a good movie,"A rather boring and predictable movie. They shouldn't have cut so many scenes. It leaves things unexplained like why so many lions were outcasts when the only bad lion in the first movie, Scar, was killed."
1,A little too dark....,"I was really dissapointed with this video. Too dark and moody - lacked the ""good feeling"" that you got when you watched The Lion King. Animation wasn't nearly as good as The Lion King - thought it was too dark and scary for my toddler and her cousins."
3,Lion King II,"The movie is good, however I made a huge mistake and ordered the VHS instead of DVD. I was terribly disappointed, guess I thought that folks didnt't sell new VHS tapes anymore."
4,Love this movie,"This movie is a classic. Almost like the original Lion King. I got this for my sister who's 8 yrs old. I'm 19 and I love this movie. But come on, who doesn't like old Disney movies. Great movie and I definitely recommend this to anyone who liked the original Lion King."
4,statisfactory,"i always wondered what the lion king 2 was about but i, nor my daughter ever saw it so i decided to get it for her birthday. being a teen she still went nuts over it. As we watched it she commented on how the animation wasn't as good as the first or 1/2 movie. the songs were great and the whole plot amazing but something made us just not completely love it. i give it a 4 because its still a beautiful movie with the romeo and juliet theme."
3,"For a sequel, not too bad!","Well, I loved The Lion King. I think it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. So understandably I was intrigued by Simba's Pride - and I wasn't actually disappointed.Let's be honest. Disney are not that good at making sequels. ... But this sequel? Well, it's not as great as the original (unsurprisingly) but it's still pretty good, and if you were a fan of TLK, I seriously recommend renting this, just to see what it's like. It's an interesting story which relates a lot better to its predecessor than most Disney sequels do, there's some nice songs (some of them tail off a bit, but others are really good) and the animation is actually okay!It's not another Lion King. ... Timon and Pumbaa are *really* starting to pall (unless you loved them very much in the first film) and Kovu's character development is rushed through way too fast. But it is worth a look, especially if you loved TLK - it should interest you, at least!"
3,I think it forgot some stuff like mentioning Simba's mother.,"This movie wasn't as powerful as the first because of how things were forgotten. Simba's mother wasn't anywhere in the story and wasn't even anounced as dead or alive anywhere. Also the cool hyenas which were really displayed in the years of the first movie weren't mentioned. Maybe just in one 6-word sentence by Nuka but thats it!! I really expected more from Timon an Pumbaa because of their major roles. It needed more suspense throughout the movie. Boring plot and layout. Other then those things, it was great in the beginning with that powerful song"" He Lives in You"". I hope they make atleast one more Lion King movie but not any more than that because it will lose it's charm. Make an interesting plot like making Zazu more in the movie along with Simbas mother. Also make the Hyenas return because the were dope!!!!!"
4,Excitement Galore,I like Kiara the best new character in the movie. Nala is cool too because she fights the bad lions. Simba is a really good daddy to his daughter. Poombah and Simon put in great preformance and provide comic relief.(review as told by Jaycee age 4 to her Father)
3,The First Is Always Better,"Lion King the second wasn't a bad movie or anything, it's just that after watching the first you'd expect more. I thought that the lions looked weird and out of proportion....They looked short and thick. And the ending was almost an exact replica of Pocahontas. Two lions in love, they're families fighting, they stop it. Even the layout was similar."
3,"Good movie, bad sequel","As a stand alone, this movie was nice. I always wondered why the bad guy was distinguished by a dark mane. But unlike the first film, the 'dark mane' lions unite in the end (instead of a single 'dark one' being destroyed to create peace). I wonder, however, where in the heck these guys came from. Sequels have made the mistake of inventing new characters who don't make sense before and the mini-pride of 'dark mane' 'scar-follower' lions was one of them. Where were these guys when Scar was getting attacked by Hyenas at the end of the original? And why did he need Hyenas in the first film if these followers exsisted?My enjoyment of the film was ruined by this lack of continuity between the two films. On the sequel scale it rates higher than most attempts Disney makes at a 'part 2', but I enjoyed the ""Aladdin"" series a little more and Toy Story 2 is proably the best animated sequel I've ever seen."
4,One of the better sequels,"Disney has put out, if not the best sequel to follow any disney movie, i wasn't expecting another excellent movie like Lion King from this sequel, but it is worthy of a look, i enjoyed it alot, obviously it doesn't stand up against ""The Lion King"" but i don't think you'll be disappointed especially if you've seen some of the sequels disney has spewed out."
3,Pretty good but not like the first,"Well I totaly loved the first lion king so I wanted to see the 2nd one. While I loved kiaria, simba,and kovoo I didn't think the animation was as good but still I liked all the songs and was very impressed on how they got scars mate to have just as much as anger as Scar had but the realy only problem I had with the story was this.. THEY NEEDED NALA! I loved her in the first she had great spirit and aggression. So they needed her more but I would recommend it. It's good just not as good as the first."
4,good but not as good as the first,"This is not as good as the first. the story starts with the celebration of kiara's birth. then one morning kiara goes to play in the Pride Lands. she promises Simba that she will not leave the Pride Lands, But Simba doesn't think that she will keep her promise so he sends Timon and Pumbaa to watch her. But they lose her and she runs of into the outlands. there she meets Kovu another young lion cub. But what she doesn't know is that Kovu is Scars hand chosen son. But I don't want to spoil the whole movie. so If you want to find out what happens you should watch the movie yourself."
5,I think it sent an excellent message to children!!!,"Hi, yes, I am a 14 year old, and I obviously do not have children of my own, although I do babysitt regularly. I think that the movie started out, dark, and maybe even evil. But then as I continued to watch, I realized that there was a whole movie based on Good vs Evil. I sat with the 5 and the 3 year old I was babysitting, and they looked at me and said ""why are they so mean?"" And that was when I realized that no matter how young kids are, they always pick up, even on the littlest things. But when the end of the movie came, the 3 year old looked up at me, and said, ""look at that, the good guys beat the bad guys, and they didn't even have to fight."" So I think that this is a excellent movie, for both young kids, and adults. Kids aren't the only ones who need to learn violence is not the answer to any of our problems."
5,The greatest movie since the first Lion King,"LIon KIng Simba's Pride is a really awesome movie. Funny, and will keep you laughing. I recommend this wonderful movie to Disney fans of all ages!"
4,Summarry of the movie,"This movie was pretty good. I don't really like the music, though. The idea of the story is very good. It is about how Simba's daughter Kiara and her lover Kovu try to make a better relationship between the Outsiders and the Pride Landers.Recommended."
4,A sequel that's not a repeat.,"When I first rented this movie, I figured it would live up to Disney standards of animation, but I was afraid that the story was going to be much too close to the original story. There were definite similarities, but the story was original enough to stand on its own. Whereas the first movie reminded me of a twist on Shakespear's MacBeth or Hamlet, this one reminded me more of Romeo and Juliet with a happy ending. It's a definite must-have for those who love Disney animation."
4,"The beginning was stupid, but it got better as it went on.","The beginning made it look like the movie was meant for children and not anyone else, but right after the cubs got older it got a lot better. Some of the songs were really great, like the one when Kovu is banished from Pride Rock. It was really good overall, but it almost seems like it's not even a sequel to the Lion King because it's so different."
5,Good Movie,"This was a good movie, espically if you like the Disney Classics. The first one was better, but I still suggest this movie."
5,very pleased,I am very satisfied with my purchase. I bought the movie as Christmas gift for my daughter. It arrived in plenty of time
4,The kid loves this movie.,My daughter just had to have this and enjoyed it very much. That is all that matters to me.
3,Shipped in timeframe,"This product was garbled in the beginning and in the end, I wouldn't call it good condition, I would have called it fair."
2,a mediocre knockoff,"This is a direct-to-video sequel that is clearly inferior to the masterpiece original. Not only are the images crude by comparison and the songs forced, but the story is almost identical: outcasts loyal to Scar plot a revenge and almost have their way; a romance ensues between lion pups that will have serious implications later on; and the theme of renewal and reconciliation win out in the end. My kids ignored what I saw as a boring rehash and clearly enjoyed it thoroughly. I simply could not suspend my disbelief and let the story carry me forward, always in the back of my mind I was thinking someone was trying hard to make this interesting and fun. Instead of a deepening of the wonderful themes of the original, it smacked of formula like the worst of TV drama. No surprises, no development of characters, no new challenges to overcome. Just the same, only more.I would not recommend buying this. But if it is on, the kids can plunk down to watch it while parents can do other things."
2,One for the Bargain Bin,"I loved The Lion King so of course I had to get this. I knew it wouldn't be as good, but watching it, it turned out to be a lot worse than I imagined... the songs were TERRIBLE, and the storyline was UNORIGINAL...why did Disney bother?? I wouldn't reccommend this, even if The Lion King is your fave movie."
1,Movie too dark for the children Disney targets,"I purchased the movie for my young children and was so disappointed, I returned it with my complaints. My children were frightened by the weird characters and loud conflicts. Plus the storyline was not redeeming; children can learn these ""lessons"" without being frightened. Regardless of Disney's marketing on TV during preschool shows, parents of young children should beware--I think there are much wiser selections."
5,Kids will watch over & over!,Lots of sequels just don't add up to much - this is an exception to that! This is a wonderful movie!-My kids (girls age 5 & 3) and I tend to like this one just as much as the first!This story tells of Simba & Nala's daughter Kiara and her friendship with Scars named replacement. Obviously Simba has a problem with Kiara befriending the heir of Scar! This movie teaches a lesson about friendship and accepting others just the way they are. This one is worth adding to your video library!1smileycat :-)
3,Pretty good but not as good as the original,"When I saw this awhile ago I thought it was pretty good but it lacked something the first one had. Its pretty good, but theres something about it...the storyline isnt quite as good.........but still pretty good"
3,Second Best,"Of course the first one was better, but Lion king 2 was never meant to be out in the cinema so for a video release it is actually darn good. Loads of repetition, and that is what kiddies like a LOT. A nice motto, but people see your dvd's with dolby surround!! Makes it more exciting! Overall? Not the best Disney, but surely a second best!"
3,Could have been more interesting,I feel that this movie could be made better. The story line seems to be the same as the earlier version. The Characters of-course are good. Kiara and Kovu are the two new additions.
3,"It was wonderful, but not as good as #1","I collect Disney Movies and my 3 year old daughter is an avid watcher of them. I have to say that I enjoyed the first one much more than the 2nd one. There is so much more color and it's ""happier"" Although my daughter loves both of them. I just think that LION KING I is much better than Simba's Pride."
4,"Not as good as the original, but still great!","We all know that sequels are often a big disappointment, so I was pleasantly surprised when this one turned out to be a pretty good follow up to the original. The music is terrific and the animation is good. The story is simple and predictable, but that's part of its charm. It has a wonderful message about prejudice and love, too; an all-around terrific movie!"
3,"Worth watching, but not as good as the original.","In fact not NEARLY as good as the original, due to a rather weak plot and some even weaker musical sequences.But it has some worthwhile viewing even so. Two song sequences are very well done: ""We Are One"" and ""Lullaby""(even better than ""Be Prepared"" IMO) And something unusual for Disney(minor spolier): the fact that when one of the villains is killed, we actually feel SORRY for them! Wow. An excellent message to send the kids: Death is not something to cheer at, even when it's the bad guy. And another villain actually switches sides and becomes a good guy! Incredible!Too bad the rest of the movie was so poor. Could have been a whole lot better"
5,Lion King II,"The Lion King II was very good, but i find, that the Lion King I was a little bit better. Can you help me to get the Lion King I. It should be a gift to my wife for the next birthday.Thank you and kind regards"
1,Don't buy it,This movie was horrible compared to Lion King I. It felt like deja vu with a lot of the scenes in the beginning and I couldn't force myself to sit through the whole thing. Stick with the original.
3,Lion King 2,I think it was a great movie but could have been a little more exciteing and more comedy as well.
2,Heh heh heh....wrong,"Erm...well the basic point here is that this movie SUX! But more to the point is that I was sleepin over at my frendz house and we were watchin this to make fun of it and we got to the part right before they sing the song about Kovu gettin exiled and Simba sez ""When you came here, you asked for judgement, WELL I PASS IT NOW!"" Then the animals in the background start mumbling and I heard one go ""YES YOU'RE GAY!"" and I rewinded it over and over and I swear to god, you can hear them say that! I didn't get it off a website or anything like that, I FOUND IT MYSELF! Yeah...I have no life..."
1,briilant,"not, i only write brillant so you'll read it, any way this film isaboustly dogs poo, take my advice and watch the sing a long, this film is badly put togjhter, simba's voive sounds like a duck and kafu looks like a gorillavery po film, watching paint dry is more funthank you"
3,TLK2:SP,"When I 1st got LK2, i got it at a Grocerie Store. I loved it when i saw it but now i think its a bit boring. LK1 is much better. But LK2 is a good Movie with cool songs. Worth a Rent."
2,"Oh, Disney, Why?","Lame.The concept was nice enough, I suppose. But I found the move to be lacking in so many ways. The music made me wince - that was probably one of the worst things in the film. The songs were completely forgetable, and cheap.Don't get me wrong - I adored the Lion King. And I thought it was interesting to have the daughter fall in love with Scar's son. But it was a poor follow up to that wonderful first film."
1,"Gees, what a loss!","The lion king 1, I've seen it over 100 times and it's not enough, but the lion king 2, I've seen it once and it's too much.If you rent it, you throw 5 dollars away. If you buy it, you throw 20 dollars away. Really not interesting, the story is no solid and the voices are no good. I can't do anything, but what a shame. I think they shouldn't have done it."
1,First Disney movie I've ever returned,"My family and I really liked most of the first Lion King movie. However, the upbeat and humerous feel of the first is nowhere to be seen in the sequel.Simba's Pride was very dark and evil. Most of the songs are like Scar's ""Be Prepared"" song from the first movie, which I did not like. The main theme of the movie is training an assassin to kill. The only redeemable part of the movie is the very end. I understand their must be good vs. evil in any movie, but I don't like it when the movie dwells almost entirely on the evil.My kids (ages 6 and 4) did not like the movie and didn't want to watch it again."
4,a gift,I bought this as a last minute gift and it shipped on time with no delays. My son was very happy it is his favorite movie.
4,Daughter loves movie,"My daughter loves the video. It was shipped quickly for a good price. It's a very good feel good movie. She asks to watch it almost everyday. The movie does skip in a few places, but that hasn't caused too much drama with her. I would buy from this seller again."
2,nOT AS GOOD AS LION KING 1,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER JUST RENT IT FROM YOUR LOCAL BLOCKBUSTER OR IF YOU HAVE LION KING 1 BUY LION KING 2 GOOD FOR YOUR COLLECTION
2,Pales in comparison to the original.,"This one looks like it's never going to get off the ground, but actually picks up about half way through and becomes a worthwhile watch, but by then it is far too late to take this one past the 2 star category. I felt like I would have been better off by just watching the original Lion King over again instead of spending my time with this average at best sequel."
2,Not even close to the first one.,"This movie was not anywhere as good as the first one. It is not very accurate. Also, the songs were kind of boring and the characters were not as funny."
2,Too violent for us,The underlying theme was too dark. The jokes were not as good. It lacked the mystic draw of the original (which I didn't like either). Get Hercules or one of the Veggie Tales instead. They are much funnier.
3,Perfection aside from...,"The DVD ended up being in fairly poor condition due to the holder of the CD in the middle of the case was broken, leaving the DVD to slide repeatedly during shipping..at least it works"
3,Not bad but definitely not of Lion King's quality,"It's alright but the images are pretty cheesy compared to Lion King, the songs aren't as great, and most of the actors have changed. A decent movie but not worth the cost."
5,Lion King DVD,"I love this movie, my 19 year old wanted it sent to college. YeahGotta love that he grew up with this and wanted comfort from home."
4,Great movie for the kids,"Shipping once again was great with Amazon. It came to our house on time and was greatly packaged. We opened the movie up and popped it into the blu ray player and it worked great. The kids (2 and 3) enjoyed watching the movie and will continue to watch again and again. The bluray/dvd combo might not be for everyone, but I got it so the kids can use the dvd version in their room."
5,Excellent sequel,"One of the few sequels that didn't kill the original disney movie. Here, like in the original Lion King shakespeare elements are used. This time Romeo and Juliet instead of Hamlet.The music was excellent and memorable. Emotional and not the crappy canned music in so many other sequels.A movie that I would still watch again and again."
3,"Good, but could be better","Overall the film flowed well, but unfortunately, like many sequels, it doesn't live up to the original. Buy it from duty free - it's only 11.90 and it's worth it. I don't think it's worth 15.00 however."
4,Really cute.,"t was't the best they,ve ever made. The music was cute, the storyline educationaI, and the picture well-done."
4,A great film that hits a home run with the kids,"Although a rich story, this second ""Made for Video"" sequel just doesn't punch as much of an impact as the original did. Great songs and storyline help this not so epic film get off the ground. It is however a great kids film! Your children will spends many hours watching this one over and over again.- Eric Boerner"
5,One of the Best,"Like Lion King. Then you like Lion King 2. one of the best Disney sequels ever. I was five when first saw lIon King. Simba's Pride went right to my listing of 5 stars when it came out. I love all the characters and I hope Disney makes a thrid one. This is really the DVD to buy. I'm still looking for my own copy to buy but I can tell you this. My VHS copy of Simba's Pride is dead cause i watched it so much. The songs, the characters, the plot---It's PERFECT. Buy it today!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent movie..... but long delivery time,"The movie and the quality are great. I was disappointed in how long it took to get here. It took about 2 and 1/2 - 3 weeks! That's the longest we've had to wait for any internet purchase for any product. Explaining that ""it will get here soon"" to a 5 year old everyday is not fun either. I'm not sure why it took so long! I sent an e-mail message to the shipping provider and did not get a response back - but eventually received the movie."
4,A rare Disney sequal,"The term ""Disney sequal"" brings up thoughts of butchering and ruining Disney classics. Strangely enough this was rather enjoyable. Unlike most other sequals this wasn't made too much longer after the first so retains most of the original voices. The plot is also somewhat related to the first--The Lion King being loosely based on Hamlet and this one being loosely based on Romeo and Juliet. This is definately worth watching, but the songs did leave something to be desired. There were also a few holes in the plot, but in terms of Disney sequals this is def in the top five."
4,excellent,I saw this book on Oprah and rushed out to buy it. It is so comforting to know that I'm not to blame. Thank you Charney Herst. I was up to page 83 before I found out that mothers of daughters with drug and/or alcohol problems needn't buy the book. BUT - it is a very helpful book. I wanted to help a friend whose daughter has a drug problem. I could still get a great deal of benefit from it for my own relationship with my grown daughter
3,Grieving Mother,It was interesting to listen to another mother tell how she has been affected by the break in her relationship with her daughter.I am trying to learn how to cope with my situation without any breaks so her advice was welcomed.Thank you for writing the book!!
1,For Mothers of Difficult Daughters: How to Enrich and Repair,"These authors are way off base. Daughters who are 'difficult' are so because they did not get what they needed from their mothers in the first place. The women who like this book are mothers who failed at parenting and now want to blame it on someone else, and guess who is handy.Mothers with 'difficult' daughters are themselves difficult people. They need to look inside first in order to find the source of their daughter's pain. Instead of blaming their daughters for being 'difficult' (which is like blaming the unhealthy fruit from a neglected orchard), these mothers might better show some responsibility and read 'Making Peace with Your Adult Children: a Guide to Family Healing'."
1,It's not your fault!,"If a mother really wants to improve her relationship with her daughter, this is wrong book to read. This book was written for mothers who are unwilling to take responsibility for their own actions and need written proof to support their position. The author tells them what they want to hear - It's not your fault!"
1,Unbelivable,"Is Unbelievable How some one can be conciderd an Expert, when Her own family life has been in shambles, I guess practice what you preach is not something they teach you in school.The book is based on clinical mumbo-jumbo. and has no basis in reality.Just my own opinion"
2,"The worst one of this series, yet I read it anyway","I still cannot believe I read this entire book just to find out if Thursday finds Landen (I peeked and still read it!). What this means is that Jaspar Fforde can write, I just don't care for this novel. If he couldn't write worth beans, I wouldn't have finished the first chapter of The Eyre Affair. So what this means is that while I don't like this book, there is obviously something about it that kept me reading and I do have to say that the fourth book isn't nearly as bad as this one (yes, crazy me, I'm reading that one to find out if she gets Landen back, and then I'm done.)"
5,Loved it so much I bought it twice,I think the title says it all. I lent my first copy and I wanted to read it again before it was returned. This whole series is great.
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the audio version!","The narrator is AMAZING and really brings this series to life. It is so clever and wonderful. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the audio version. Just when I think it cannot get any better, it does!"
4,Love this series!,This is great series. I just recently discovered it and I'm so glad I did. Mr. Fforde has an incredible imagination.
3,Funny but exhausting,This book is unlike any other: it's part three of a series of zany books that are non-stop jokefests about literature and writing within the framework of a sort-of mystery story. Lots of funny lines but ultimately a little tiring.
2,Lost in the well...,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Thursday Next novels, I had a lot of trouble falling into Jasper Fforde's world the third time. There was very little advancement of the story; instead most of the book involved the description of the world-within-a-world, The Well of Lost Plots. I felt like I was watching one of those movies that rely far too much on special effects: all the razzle-dazzle of the gramasites, the Text Sea, plots being sold on the black market, etc. try to distract the reader from the lack of an actual STORY. Here's hoping the next book is better."
2,Nothing happens!,"I really loved the first two books in Fforde's Thursday Next series. Therefore, I was extremely disappointed in ""The Well of Lost Plots."" I literally could not finish it. I always have a pile of books by my bed and the call of another author was just too great. I abandoned this book on about page 150. I was mired in cleverness and inside book jokes. Other reviewers have noted that this book takes place almost entirely inside the world of books. I think that may be the problem. There's no connection to the characters in the Outland or the previous storylines. Also, I began this book within a day of finishing ""Lost in a Good Book""; maybe I just needed a break. Thursday Next is my hero and I wanted to read more about her. I just couldn't maintain my interest in the plot -- or lack thereof. I'm going to try the fourth book in the series, upon the recommendation of one of the reviewers, but I found this book to be considerably less satisfying than the first two. Be forewarned."
2,"Depressing world, disappointing read","Yes, the Well of Los Plots is dazzlingly imaginative. But it delivers precious little of the Thursday Next we know and love from Fforde's previous two (delightful) efforts. Here she is little more than a projectile careening from one madcap scene to the next. The hilarity, too, is sadly superficial. Ultimately, the alternative world of The Well of Lost Plots is a joyless place, where literature is, really, just another dreary industrial product. This novel feels like an unwelcome digression from the REAL story, which, hopefully, will resume very soon."
3,"tediously humorous... or humorously tedious, hard to decide.","This book was full of witticisms and puns, but the plot and character development definitely took a back seat. I got the feeling that the author was so in love with the cleverness of his invention that he stopped caring very much about the narrative line or characters.This series reminds me of ""A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and ""Monty Python,"" and maybe that's the niche he's going for... quite inventive, intermittently funny and fairly diverting, but not even slightly compelling or moving. Ideally I like to care a bit more about what happens to the characters I'm reading about.In short, while it's not the kind of thing I'd keep in my library forever and want to re-read (once is enough), I might read another in the same series if I didn't have anything more immediately compelling lined up."
3,"A good read, But","Hmm, it's a good book but I think that the series was a lot more fun when it was in the real world and not set entirely in the Book world.I never really bought into the central plot device and I really didn't feel that the whole UltraWord thing was fleshed out enough to make it that important not to mention that several of the drawbacks of it seem kind of tacked on.All in all I think that this is definitely worth reading but not nearly as good as the first two Thursday Next novels and I definitely liked the Nursery Crime books better. They seem to take themselves less seriously and are just more fun."
4,Read the Thursday Next series in order,"I enjoyed this book, though found it harder to get into then the rest. It takes a while for a real mystery/plot to show up. Even though background is given within the story I would highly recommend you start with The Eyre Affair and read the Thursday Next series in order."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Undercover operative.Or perhaps between covers, as there is a lot of hiding out in books and exploring the alternate fictional reality for new agent Next.A detective of course, in these non-realistic fluffier type mysteries has to have a murder (or several), and that is certainly what she gets, in amongst the book shows and libraries of anything, and bad guys out to get her.Quirky, but the mystery part isn't too interesting.3 out of 5"
1,Not the versions you know and love,"Gloria Gaynor has like 5 greatest/bestof/collection cds out there.This specific cd has a slower version of ""never can say goodbye"" that is not as good as the ones I have heard on other cdsIt also has 2 versions of ""I will survive"" and also as part of a medley on the last track. NONE of them are as good as the original. One of them is slow and is undanceable, the other 2 have a horible echo thing going on.I strongly urge you to get a different greatest hits disc from Gloria Gaynor."
1,worst online purchase ever!,Very difficult to install. It took too much time and ended up messy.It worked for one day and then some cheap plastic part broke and fell off.I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
1,What a piece of crap,"I have used this for a fairly long time now and I hate it, hate it, hate it. Takes three hands to use it if you can get the cutting tool to work at all. Don't buy this thing."
1,Doesn't hardly work anymore,"Bought this while trying to find an under-counter can openener that would tolerate overhangs. As other people have noted, the arm you lift up to insert the can comes off WAY too easily - they should have made it to where you have to rotate it counterclockwise another 90 degrees or so before it can be removed. Also, after just a few months' use it does not open cans anymore, even while holding the can to it and helping it rotate the can. This is a horrible product and I would definitely not buy again. Wish another manufacturer made one that can fit under a lipped cabinet..."
1,Defective Motor,"This is an identical replacement to a 10 year excellent product. The new one has a weak motor and after one month the motor ""squeals"" loudly when I try to use it. I would like the supplier to replace it with one they have tested to be good. (I wish I had saved my old one and just replaced the removable cutter which was worn out.) I have my Amazon receipt but never expected anything but an excellent product like the one I replaced so have already tossed out the box, etc."
1,Avoid buying,"I had one of these for 10 years and replaced it expecting the same quality. What a mistake. It takes at least 3 or 4 trys to even get the can opener started, and the motor just buzzes most of the time. Save yourself the frustration and avoid this product."
1,Waste of Money,"After mounting the opener, I tried my first can...to no avail. The opener's motor couldn't even turn the can, it would just stop when the can was inserted. My old Black and Decker was a cadillac compared to this. I had to unmount the opener and return it."
4,Works great!,Installed very easily. Looks great. Works perfectly on all types of cans. I wish someone would come up with a automatic can opener that opened the can on the seam instead of the top.
5,Under-The-Cabinet Can Opener,Excellent quality & sturdy. This is the second one I've owned. The first lasted 5 years with heavy heavy use. Teeth finally wore out on the sprocket that turns the can.
3,Decent but not great.,"The magnet/handle comes off WAY to easy. Can be annoying. However, seems to be getting easier as I get used to this one. Motor isn't super strong but suffices."
1,It broke!,"We had a difficult time finding an undercounter unit. I installed it as per instructions. First time we tried to open a can, the blade assembly broke. Amazon was good to reimburse us and we appreciate them for standing behind their product."
5,Terrific under cabinet can opener!,"This was perfect for my needs; ""space"". Although the photo shows the can opener facing forward, I was able to place it off to the right underneath my cabinet, facing toward my sink. It's small enough and yet large enough to do the job for all cans. It also features a magnetic top holder that is ""flexible""! In other words you can leave it up or simply pull it down on top of your can to hold the lid. It's also not very noisy compared to other electric can openers I've tried. Great little product with a great price tag compared to other much more expensive ones I've tried! Thank you for making it available.Sincerely, Pica"
4,Under Counter Can opener,Good product although the handle that you push to open the can is loose and sometimes falls off. Otherwise I really like the product.
2,Can do better,Can opener will operate IF the can is placed JUST right and better if the can is small. It hates tuna fish sized cansI could open the can faster with a hand held before I have the can placed right on the opener.
4,Excellent item!,"It is compact yet efficient, saves my hands from cramping and fits perfect under my counter.....I love this small appliance."
3,can opener,"Works very well, quiet, fit nicely into the space we wanted it to.Made a nice gift for my mom."
2,Not as good as the black volumizing Marilyn brushes.,I wasn't as impressed with this Marilyn brush. It was harder to get through my hair and it made it really flat. That may be because this one is for straight looks without volume. I highly recommend the black Marilyn brush that is for straight styles WITH volume. Way better.
5,Classic James Marshall,"If you have a child between 3 and 8, you should buy this book. The late, great James Marshall (Edward was a pseudonym) had the rare ability to tell a story using easy-to-read words, but still with genuinely surprising and humorous twists. This book's ending is a brilliant twist, which I will not spoil here.If you don't have a child the right age, you should buy this anyway, but you may have to think of an excuse.This book ranks with Marshall's best, which also include the sublime ""Three By the Sea,"" as well as the better-known ""Miss Nelson"" and ""George & Martha"" books.A note to the publisher: You really should keep James Marshall's better books available in hardcover library editions. This guy's best works are classics, and they'll continue to sell for at least another century."
4,The 1920s,"This book was great! It told a lot, almost everything. You gotta read it! It helps a lot with reports, very detailed."
3,THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPECCABLE....BUT....,"This book would have been impeccable only if the authors/editors were more patient and careful. It has a number of misspelt words. There are few figurative illustrations when compared to similar more-than-one-thousand paged texts; and some of them were poorly done. But these aside, I find the contents, particularly the areas that dealt with Physiochemistry, very interesting. I love the comprehensive outlook that most of the chapters wore."
3,Textbook of medical physiology,I thought it was full of interesting and good information that I was not aware of. This will help me with my job.
5,best physiology book,"I think this is the best physiology book that i've ever read.The language is simple yet it is totally scientific in nature.I would recommend this book to any person who wants to have an in depth knowlegde of human physiology.you can be a doctor,scientist or even a student and I guarantee this book will help you in understanding physiology."
2,Why do supervisors ecommend this book,"I have heard Guyton described as a ""fine work of English prose"". I must say I disagree. I have found that it is difficult to use, that it fails to go into enough depth as a reference yet goes into too much depth as a revision work. The diagrams are poor, the pages flimsy (and in my edition in the wrong order!), and it is just far too heavy to carry around. The physiology focuses more on obscure subjects and hardly at all on the essentials. I have hardly used this in my first year as a medical student and am unlikely to start soon."
3,Do Not Rely On This Text As A Primary One!,This textbook is not good. It is wordy and very confusing. Definately not a text for a busy medical student.
1,I have to agree with these students,"This is without a doubt the most disjointed, incomplete, randomly arranged book of busywork that I have ever seen.I couldn't find much real geometry.... lots of ""puzzles"" and brain teasers, very very little teaching, theory, etc.And very, very, very simplistic ""algebra review"".Save your money or use it to light a fire."
1,AWFUL!!!,"The worst math book ever written. The explanations are terrible and overall the book is way below par. Don't ever buy this book, you'll regret it just like I do. It's a waste of $80. Please teachers, don't teach your kids using this book. Sorry Heath, your book SUCKS!!!"
5,Really Good Geometry Book,"I taught out of this book at a Christian school. Teaching in another school now, I picked the well-rated Jacobs geometry text, but I wish this one were still in print. I would pick it for out school if it were. I got my copy from some company linked in to amazon. As usual, I paid very little for a book in really good shape."
1,Go away!,"This book sucks. Period. I repeat, IT IS HORRIBLE! I have found so many grammar errors, and even MATH ERRORS. If they're supposed to be teaching us the stuff, how can they get it wrong? Also, this is aimed at like 15 year olds, maybe they shouldn't have it worded like it was a college textbook. On top of all that, they explain things in the most confusing way possible, and usually don't explain it enough. I hate this book, it sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks! I advise you, do not get it. You'll be sorry."
1,don't waste your time with this one......,This is a horrible geometry book. It is not good at explaining the proofs. Don't waste your time with this book.
1,i dont like geometry,"i think geometry is boring, this book needs to make it exciting, like... it needs... fire, and maybe some dancing chimps. Maybe i'm just special."
5,A Wonderful Starting Place,"This is an excellent book for someone just starting (or restarting) into the world of railroads (like myself). It provides not only information about diesel locomotives built before 1972, but background about each manufacturer, details of special modifications, locomotive repowerings, and even detail photos of common truck assemblies. Subjects are organized first by manufacturer, then in basic chronological order by specification (normally-aspirated, turbocharged, gas-turbine, etc). It's a fine overview of the first days of diesel."
4,rail road history,Excrllent reference for the person just wondering about the engine going by as they wait at a crossing. Most of these engines are out and about every day. Price is correct for a used book on Amazon.
1,"Cole wants to change society, not illiteracy","Cole's answer to illiteracy is more money, more teachers, smaller classes, better food, happy families, and some more money, etc. His attempt to change the focus of the ""reading wars"" to a ""war on poverty"" is another way of saying, ""Teacher's aren't responsible for student learning."" Cole continues to perpetuate many ""reading myths,"" confusing teachers and the public who really want to put an end to illiteracy. Thank heavens for money back guarantees."
5,Diggin it,"If your looking to have ur ear buds listen to some psychadelic rock funk jam then pgroove's sweet oblivious antidote is the album for you to purchase next. As someone who jams to this band on a daily basis it is my favorite piece of work by them. There is not one band jam in this album in my opinion its amazing from start to finish. With three weeks, tsmm, sundog, robot waltz, and teakwood beatz it brings you thru a groovy experience. If you have never witnessed a show by these guys please come out and support them at the best festival of the summer this year at Wakarusa 2011 in Ozark, Arkansas you can find out more info by looking at [...]"
1,Multiple defective units,"I have used Maxtor 250 GB external drives for years. Only of several units failed. But I have had terrible experience with the 1.5 TB Maxtor drive. First unit installed ok (as mirrored backup drive), but failed after two months. Replacement unit was DOA. It would not install properly. Second replacement unit would not format at first, but after many tries did format and run briefly. It is now inoperative. Maxtor should not be selling the 1.5 TB units. I have since learned that many others have also had bad experience with them. This has been very time consuming for me. It is ironic that the system I purchased as a highly reliable, mirrored backup drive was so unreliable itself."
4,"If for no other reason, by it for Tenessee","This is a decent CD of some of Hank's earlier music. Tenessee is by far the best song on the CD. If you haven't heard the song, you need to pick this one up."
4,A Voice Crying in the Wilderness,"The stories within these pages makes my so-called ethical struggles pale in comparison but the message is clear. Your ethics will be challenged and upholding an ethical choice will most likely require sacrifices that are necessary if you are to adhere to choices that you can truly live with.I liken the meaning of this message to ""What does it profit a man to gain the whole world but suffer the loss of his own soul."" I hope and pray that more people will respond ethically if for no other reason than they want to do the right thing; reading this book may help you in that endeavor. God Speed!"
1,Caution - Poor customer service and shady,"I bought my watch from Watch Grabber less than one year ago. It was made by Swiss Army and it is supposedly waterproof up to 100 meters. My watch recently started letting in water, so I called Amazon and Swiss Army to inquire about their warranty. Neither could offer me any warranty service, and I was told to contact the distributor (Watch Grabber) directly. Watch Grabber told me it had a two year warranty on all of the watches it sold. I told Watch Grabber about my problem. Conveniently, however, Watch Grabber's ""warranty"" does not cover ""water damage."" I asked where I could find the terms of its watch warranty. I was told the terms are located on Watch Grabber's website. I cannot find any warranty information on Watch Grabber's website. Shady. Watch Grabber does not deserve a one star rating, but I had to rate one star to submit this review."
1,Boycott 21mm Lugs!,"21mm lugs, what are they insane!Boycott anything with 21mm lugs when they could have simply made them 20mm or 22mm, it's not standard and they are messing with us and don't deserve our money!"
4,Another handy dictionary.,"Finding a good dictionary to work with is hard. The COD is a good mate when studying English or just looking things up, but if you realy want to have a broad dictionary with a lot of examples, maybe you'd better use the Oxfors Advanced Learners or the Collins Cobuild ( I myself do not like this one because of its very thin paper). But if you neet a compact and reliable dictionary, then this is a good bargain."
5,Affordable cordless kettle,"Just simply like it! Simple and easy to use, I have been using it for 1 year and never get any problems. A good buy."
2,Too much plastic,"I don't store food in plastic, and this kettle's interior is all plastic (except for the heater, which is on the bottom) -- I don't want to be heating the water I drink in plastic either. (Heated plastic gives off more chemicals than cold plastic.)I didn't even fire it up, I'm just sending it back..."
4,very convienient and easy to use,"This item was something I purchased instead of a tea pot since it would do just about what I wanted. I have found myself using it for more than that though. For instant oatmeal, boiling water for receipes and other odd items. The only real drawback to the item is that it is a little slower than the description and I really wish I could boil other things (wouldn't it be nice to be able to use milk with this?). Other than that, it's nice not to have to worry about boiling away a pot of water because I forgot about it."
5,Nice product.,"I bought this food processor solely based on the brand name reputation. And luckily I am not disappointed. I have used it twice so far - once to mash chick peas for falafel, and once to chop veggies, and the machine handled it very well.The chopping was not a problem but I was afraid that the motor would not be able to handle the sticky chick peas. But it did thanks to its powerful electric motor."
1,Very disappointed,"I am new to the world of food processors and bought this based on the reputation of the brand name. I find this item very difficult to use. It has 2 speeds, supersonic and ultra-super sonic, and it ""walks"" across the table on either speed. The main unit vibrates to the point where it rotates out of the slot and shuts down the machine. The top spindle came out of its slot and damaged the cover.The instructions are not very beginner friendly. They basically have these cute little pictures that illustrate all the different ways to assemble it. As a novice, it's not intuitive to me that assembly style #1a would be for puree and #3b would be for grating cole slaw, etc.I'm very unhappy with this product."
3,okay movie,it wasn't as good as i thought it would be. too much of an emotional plea to be very convincing.
4,Gruesome,This is a difficult film to watch when it comes to the actual execution. The story of a small town run by a few evil men is familiar but it is modified by the position of women in some Middle Eastern societies.
4,fantastic,I was surprised how powerful this story was...I was expecting something more like stoning in zorba the greek...this seemed more real...unfortunately so...
5,so sad,Loved the movie....angered by the info! Wish it were more who were not afraid to uncover and inform about disgusting truths!
5,The Stoning of Soraya M.,"Stoning Deaths: A form of execution condoned and perpetrated by fcuked-up sanctimonious idiots. Condemned by those who are not!The Stoning of Soraya M., and many more women in the world, should galvanize the civilized people of the world to condmn that barbaric practice."
3,pretty good movie,I watched this movie. It was pretty good. I would recommend it. It makes you think. The actors were good. The directing was good. The credits at the end of the movie were good.
5,"SAD, SAD, SAD, SO UNBELIEVABLY SAD","This is an incredibly sad movie. Definitely worth watching, but so very, very sad. I cried and cried. Don't view unless you want to watch a tear jerker."
5,"Amazon film, deeply moving and thought-provoking","I read about this film in EW a couple months back and was happy to see it out finally. This movie really pulled me in. Fine performances by everyone involved. Great cinematography, music, and direction. It really shines a light on what people do with power and how they'll use the name of God to get what they want. The fact that this kind of barbarism is still carried shows how far we still have to come as the human race in my opinion. Highly recommend. I also found one of the other reviews helpful in regards to what is actually in the Koran and Islamic law very interesting. I myself did not find the film anti-Iranian or anti-Islam but understand how some people could. There are bad people and horrible crimes carried out in every religion."
5,The Stoning of Soraya M,"The Stoning of Soraya M: A very beautiful filmed movie. This is a MUST watch by every human. This is the best movie of the decade. If you thought that everyone hated the muslims before you see this film. Then after you watch this movie you will understand why all hate the 'son's of all pigs'.Grate movie, very touching and can not be view in just one setting.Two thumbs up for the movie and true story. Two thumbs down to all muslim pigs.Richard"
3,Great But Not In English,This is advertised on Amazon as being in English. It's not. Has English subtitles. Otherwise it's a great movie.
5,Wonderful,This is a great movie. Heart wrenching to see how women were treated. I recommend this movie to all that are interested in these types of films.
5,An Eye Opener and a Must See,"This film grips one's attention from start to finish. The acting is very good. It is truly an educational film for women in the West who are unaware of how far we have come, and also for those who think men are so superior that they must always run the show. Soraya is extremely well acted right down to the stoning, and death. Quite a tragic story. A sequel of how the film came to be made would be well received."
2,Too Basic,"Not a bad book, but way to basic for me. I had just purchased Premiere Elements, and had been playing around with it after reading the book and viewing the DVD that came with the program. This Visual QuickStart Guide did not add much to help me use the program better. I find that ""Adobe Premiere Elements for Dummies"" has a lot more to offer."
1,Intermediate Accounting and the online Joke,"I think that your online quizes are the most rediculous things I have seen in my four years of college. Not only are they on such minute detail that they require several readings of your material in order to pick out the correct answers, they are enforcing a feeling of defeat in the early part of my semester. Your tests do not measure what I have learned, they measure how much raw data I have memorized, this will not assist me in becoming a better accountant. I suggest you revamp your tecnique and use your web site to assist in learning rather than the emphasis on memorizing small accounting factoids that are buried deep in your poorly written and overpriced texts."
2,Not so soft after washing! And wrinkles galore!,"I was very excited when I first felt these sheets still in the package though! I thought the softness was amazing! BUT when I washed them this softness seemed to disappear. I not only washed then once and was very generous on the fabric softenner but 3 times and the result was still the same. So now I have average sheets that are about as soft as what you would buy at your local Walmart and I actually had to iron out the wrinkles in the flat sheet and pillow cases.These are also made in India so do not get too fixated on the ""Egytian"" description. If you are looking for regular sheets you will have to iron then these are the sheets for you."
1,Remixes of new--not original--material.,"I work in a record shop, so when I read news a month ago that this was being released I immediately began to look forward to it. However, I was 100% let down before the first track was over because this album does not include remixes of the orginal recordings but remixes of newly recorded vocals by Mike Score. Nowhere on the packaging is this specified, so beware that that is what you are getting. If you must check this out yourself, I think you'll be disappointed with the difference between then and now. It definitely wasn't worth the money I paid for it."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"This is a serious contender for the worst remix album ever released. At least the equally poor OMD remixes had the Moby reworking of 'Souvenir' as a saving grace, (and the original vocals)! Every track here is an insult to the original, and to the art of remixing itself. Think of that vocal/lyric/synth hook you loved so much from the original track. Well, its long gone now. If you're that desperate to hear the songs that you've loved being mutilated or sacrificed, rent 'The Wedding Singer' - at least there'd be a few laughs in store..."
2,Is this CD any good ?,A compilation of very noisy updated remixes of these classic 80's tracks that should have been left alone. Unless you are into the trend of very loud sped-up annoying sounding pseudo industrial that became popular in the mid to late 90's then you will not appreciate what they did to these songs. Almost all of them have that unimaginative pounding beat that never changes throughout the entire 3 to 5 minutes of each track. I listened to it one time and realized that I never needed to hear it ever again. I put it up on Discogs for sale the following day.
1,The crappest Hits remixed,"Not good for 80s sound fans. The remixes are not the original ones and if I was a DJ I could not play any of these tracks.They're all rubbish, they sound absolutely awful even the whissing and the the more you live versions are an insult to the originals.What a waste of money!J.C"
5,Smashing and debonaire!,Love this little guy's hair! Just like on t.v. It's not easy to find a male doll like this dressed in a fine suit. I think he can relate with any of the female dolls as a male admirer but his face is a bit larger than a Ken doll. Very much resembles Dempsey ... cute and handsome.
2,Some good info. but not my style,"I bought this book to have an easy book to refer to for health and developmental questions about my baby. It has some good factual information (how much babies sleep at different ages, what illnesses need medical attention, etc). I don't agree with her opinions about sleep (using Ferber, not supportive of co-sleeping) and I think she gives too little attention to alternative ways of treating illnesses. If you are into attachment parenting and/or alternative medicine, don't buy this book! If you tend to follow whatever your doctor recommends and are OK with letting your baby cry it out, you'll probably find this book helpful."
5,A Dad,"This book is great! I have been able to find almost everything I need to know about our son's health, growth and development in Baby 411. The authors are surprisingly entertaining in describing what could be very boring, but important stuff. My wife and I are EXTREMELY glad we bought this book and highly recommend it."
4,AMUST HAVE and READ for Parents of Newborns,"This book is awesome. I give one to each expectant mother I know. It is easy to understand, witty, and Dr. Brown exhibits her knowledge and compassion for the babies that she cares for. I highly recommend this book to all parents, grandparents, and all those who care about babies and their welfare.I THOUGHT I SELECTED 5 STARS...THIS DEFINITELY DESERVES 5 STARS"
1,Not for compassionate parents!,"I found the advice in this book to be too harsh. If you are at all into ""attachment parenting"", this book is not for you! It talks about babies as if they are objects to be trained instead of little human beings who need love. Yes, I believe in careful guidance, but the advice given here makes you feel that soothing or comforting your baby will turn him into a demanding monster! I read this book but then discarded it. I did not use any of the advice in this book, and my daughter is now a year old and happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. I was disappointed because it was from the publishers of Baby Bargains, a book I found indispensable while preparing for my baby."
1,What an arrogant author,"This book was beyond horrible. What a one sided opinion thus making it hard to make informed decisions. I rarely take the time to add my 2 cents and review a book, but save your money. On the other hand I loved Baby Bargains and I have no idea how both books could share a co-author."
2,Riddled with errors,"While the book does have a lot of great information, it is also riddled with editorial errors -- and I'm not just talking spelling. Statements in one section often contradict statements in another part of the book. Don't use this book as a primary resource. And definitely don't use this book if you prefer ""attachment"" parenting."
2,Too One-Sided,I am very disappointed with this book because it is one-sided. Other books present the facts for both sides of an argument so the reader can make an informed choice. This author obviously feels her very conservative view is the best and ridicules other choices. I couldn't believe the statements regarding birthing plans. Very demeaning to alternative views. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I like the format.
5,Baby 411 - Excellent Reference,"This is the best book out there for a quick reference. We began began referring to it before our baby was born. Our baby is now 7 months old, and it is still an excellent source. There are a myriad of topics. The book references a variety of credible theorists and sources and presents the information in a non-bias, conversational style. I highly recommend Baby 411."
4,A nice addition to my kitchen appliances!,"I am very happy with my steamer. It has a very large capacity and is perfect for steaming broccoli and cauliflower. I find myself eating more vegetables now, everything tastes better steamed. The rice tray works better on the second shelve than on the first and that might be the other reviewers problem. I'm completely satisfied with my steamer and use it two or three times a week."
2,Not for rice,"If you're planning on cooking rice, buy a regular rice cooker (looks kind of like a crock pot). It will work much better and faster."
2,Did not last through the warranty period.,"I am here looking for a new rice steamer because the Krups no longer gets hot enough to cook rice effectively. Last night we cooked rice for two hours and it still was not done. You could tell by watching that the steam was not as heavy as it used to be. Unfortunately I have no receipt and the place where I bought it has closed so I have no recourse. I have had it about a year and when it worked it worked great, but with the Krups name and associated price tag, I expected it to last longer."
5,good,"im satisfied with my purchase, i received on time and the price was low.. it has really good tips, its a great book"
1,This is not a Christian book,"I was shocked when reading some of the things she wrote. Do not waste your time! This is not a Christian book...some things hinted at her being Jewish, but her values were not Biblical. She talked about they had sex until a time after the engagement and how they thought they were very admirable for abstaining for a short time before the wedding. There are many other books that are much more beneficial!"
3,Great Expectations,"Two friends of mine recently have married and I've intended to give them a present. But, the book is not as worthy as I imagined."
4,A breath of fresh air.,"This book is a revelation to anyone overwhelmed with the pressures of getting married and preparing a wedding. It will really help you put the focus back where it belongs, on your betrothed and on the sacredness of the rite you are about to undertake. Truly a breath of fresh air among the overpowered, facile and downright creepy expectations that so many wedding books try to implant. My thanks to the author!"
5,awsome book,"I will get married in July and like any other (or most) brides I have the desire to have a memorable day. This book show me that if I put god first in my plans I will not only have a memorable day, but also I will make this day memorable for all my guests. Also this book helped me with the issue about who should I invite, how to deal with the ones that I do not invite. How to choose the ones that will be part of the wedding, how to deal with any issue that arise because of the in-laws and many other topics. I definitely suggest this gook for any bride despite of her religion."
3,my views,The product is great for cookies n serves its function but for bigger mass production the plastic edges hurt your fingers after a while of cutting with them but looks and works great..
1,I hate this can opener,You have to fight with the product to get it to open the can..I'm ready to through it into a wall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! don't buy!! I wish I could give it 0 stars!
1,Really bad...,"The, currently, other reviewer is quite right. I've used this thing for several months now and have been so utterly dissatisfied that I'd rather use a hammer to open the can. Look elsewhere if you /really/ need an electric can opener."
1,Verizon sucks,"Ok, the card itself was adequate, it worked. But my 5G card got horrible overages (despite assurances that 5G is enough for any regular single person, unless they are streaming games or movies). No one would tell me what I was doing wrong or why it could be happening. The customer service was beyond terrible. No one knows what they are talking about and one gets transferred everywhere, dropped, etc. After 4 months with no resolution I cancelled my service. I really wanted it to work out, but it didn't. Only then did anyone call me back, but not to help with the problem, but to get me to stay as a customer. Empty apologies galore all the way up the ladder to corporate... no cancellation fee refund."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I used this card for 3 days and returned it. Yes, it utilizes EVDO networking systems, but it has the speed of a dial-up modem in most metropolitan areas. Commingle this lousy speed, terrible latency, with outrageously stingy, but pricey service plans and you have a card ripe for the circular file!If you must get a card of this size and technology, go with the Pantech series or upgrade to a USB card and of course with another carrier. I can't believe I'm stating this, but Sprint actually offers a better deal with much more bandwidth. Of course, this review is solely for the card and not the service, but considering it is proprietary to Verizon, one cannot honestly separate the two, and both suck."
4,"Cod, Sole and Shrimp Feast; Friskies Fancy Feast","Our two cats are 4.5 and 7.5 years old (so their teeth are good) and they love the no-chunck, pate-like consistency. They love this flavor. This is a great product we include in their feeding rotation (some wet food, some dry food, some treats)."
4,Interesting ballet with outstandingly inventive staging,"I had seen this production live, and was impressed not only by the dancing and the dramatic storyline but by the creativity and beauty of the staging. If you are familiar with Zhang's work in Hero etc., you can anticipate his attention to color and vivid effects in this stage production. This filmed version of the production preserves most of that vitality, although occasionally the camera is a too little far from the action, and the lightening effects are not always completely captured. This DVD is titled in Chinese, and other than the packaging appears to have no revision for Western sale."
3,3.5 stars - in your face heavy punk rock,"2000's Over the Top was the debut album by punk rockers Silver Tongued Devil. The band plays high speed punk rock that owes a lot to Motorhead, the Stooges and maybe a little Social Distortion. It's all fast guitars, heavy rhythms, gruff vocals and a serious attitude (see: ""You Broke My Heart So I Broke Your Face"" and ""Rockin' Riot""). They're not breaking any new ground, but it's certainly fun to listen to, and I bet they are (were?) a blast live.This one is pretty simple. If you like fast, aggressive punk with a rock n' roll edge (or maybe it's the other way around), you'll probably get a kick out of Over the Top. It's 8 songs (at just over 18 minutes) of high-octane, kick in the teeth rock."
2,Depletes rapidly,"These batteries take a bit longer to charge up and once charged, they discharge quite rapidly. The best indicator I have of their performance is when they are used to power a portable LCD TV. Within 10 minutes of use, the screen will start to grey out. With other brands of NiMH batteries this event usually doesnt occur until the 1.5 hour mark. I am guessing these batteries can maintain max amperage for only a brief period of time. My kids have noticed that these batteries only last about 1/5 as long in powering their Gameboy. This brand is not recommended."
1,Sunpak Nimh AA batteries,"I have tried quite a few different brands of Nimh batteries, and Sunpak batteries are the worst brand I have tried (out of 8 brands). They do not provide nearly the rated amount of current (The Sunpak 2300 cells that I bought all tested out at less than 1500ma capacity with a 250ma current draw) They do not hold their voltage as well as other brands under load either.Do not get this brand! It just doesn't measure up."
1,NOT EVEN WORTH 1 STAR,I AM A REGULAR SHOPPER ON AMAZON AND HAVE NEVER RETURNED AN ITEM.BUT as they say theres always a first time.THE ITEM LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THEN WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE AD!! THE ITEM IS WORTH $20 IF THAT. I RETURNED ITEM THE NEXT MORNING AFTER RECEIVING IT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRESSED TO GIVE THAT AS A GIFT TO ANYONE.
1,FrameMaker 5.5.6 for Dummies,"Ordered the book the week it was available.OK, so now I know how to add color, graphics, indexes, master pages...but HOW do I start a file? The book is well written and quite detailed, but misses some of the ""basics"" that I would expect from a xFD book. Examples are inadequate for a beginner book. And whatever happened to cross platform compatibility with FrameMaker...there are separate sections in instructions for Windows, UNIX, MAC (with more on UNIX and MAC). No examples on the CD, just more programs to sell (samples of other applications and FrameMaker). Could really have used a walk-thru, or even some interactive tutorials online on the CD. Many good caveats and several BTWs(makes me want to AVOID FrameMaker). May be good for intermediate user, but don't try using the FD book without some FM experience. Overall, I was disappointed, both with the book and with FrameMaker, maybe I'm too much of a DUMMY for this series. My last FD book."
2,A lesson in how NOT to write a book,"""Killing Our Own""... the title really says it all: those who wrote this book are completely biased and irrational. This book is one third poor scientific understanding, one-third good journalistic skills (and a whole lot of words), and one-third anti-nuclear propaganda. The result is laughable, and should be avoided by anyone looking to further their understanding of nuclear energy.Wasserman and Alvarez have no formal nuclear training. It is clear after reading this book that they have very limited understanding of they subject matter. One thing is certain though: they really hate nuclear energy. And that's a shame too, since it is the only energy source that can rid us of our dependence on foreign oil, provide emission-free electricity, and produce the mass quantities of hydrogen that will fuel our future economy.This book is good if you're looking for examples of anti-nuclear propaganda, and is the only reason I gave it two stars."
4,Great pictures of woodland animals for preschoolers,"This little book has clear drawings of 10 woodland animals (also a seal and a fish)near their homes, with a brief sentence naming each animal and the place where it lives. It ends with dogs, cats and kids living in a house."
1,"No original content! Not an ""expert""!","This book is really a compilation as the author says of ""innumerable hours of research"". However if his book is so great and he is ""veteran authority"" on the subject I do expect from him to know enough to write original and valuable content. I checked at jobmonkey.com and hcareers.com as the other reviewers suggest and yes, around 80% of the book's content can be found there. Since it is expensive either check these sites or buy Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days. Thanks to it I easily got a cruise job."
4,Nice necklace,"All in all a very nice necklace for the price. The only complaint is that the cloth for the pendant will require you to tie it to length. It did make a good Valentine's gift, though."
3,OK but I really needed the cream color one.....,"needed the cream color one not the white one, so had to accept a second choice. If cream color one comes in later, will order that one instead."
5,Pretty and functional!,"My husband has just discovered the joy of real butter. Previously, he had put butter in a small bowl to keep it at room termperature. As sad as it sounds, I bought this dish for him for Christmas. It's not only functional, but pretty enough to be kept on the table, if desired. It is a nicely constructed piece and will last a long time."
2,butter dish,When receiving this product the shipping box was mangled and the bottom portion of the butter dish had a good size chip out of it. Otherwise it was exactly as shown on the product page. Very nice all white butter dish. It would have been perfect if it weren't broken. Better packaging is necessary.
3,Lid doesn't stay on,"I just wanted a basic butter dish with a lid that snaps on. That's pretty much what I got, but the lid doesn't stay on. I can't tell you how many times I've taken it out of my cabinet, only to have it fall upside down (of course) on the counter, while leaving the lid in my hand. Would not recommend."
2,"Its true, butter doesn't fit","I was having a hard time finding a butter dish so for $7.99 I thought I'd give it a try. I cannot believe they make a butter dish that cannot fit and standard piece of butter. If you buy the long skinny ones it will probably work for you. Standard ones just hit the cover and make a mess. It is sturdy and looks fine. Not worth returning, straight to GoodWill."
2,"Lack of quality control, scratches and cracks in the glazing.","This is the second dish I got, and this again has little cracks and holes in the glazing. Since they go all the way through the glazing these spots will turn brown and might even crack further. The butter dish is b-quality and should have been marked as such or sorted out. As much as I like the solidity and the size, the quality isn't there."
5,Butter Dish,"This butter dish is exactly what I have been looking for. It's heavy enough that is doesn't turn over every time it's bumped or the cover doesn't come off. It is very solid and holds a full stick of butter. On top of that it is pretty, too. I'm glad I bought it."
2,little disappointed,"This blender does the job passably, but the blade is so much higher than the plastic ridges that it makes it hard to blend things like cloves of garlic into your hummus, say. the garlic just gets a bit tattered and nothing more...Also, there is less power than I expected, even on the ""high"" setting blending something simple takes way too long.:("
4,Blender Use,"I like the blender, it works really great to create a variety of cocktails, milkshakes as well as mashing up stuff such as beans to make refried beans. It doesn't do a great job of smushing up small amounts of food to make baby food; the blender whirls with so much power it just sucks up the food into the blade but won't let it out. This item is great for making gravy too, but it can throw food up and out of shallow pans with the centrifugal force it creates so watch the hot stuff."
4,Easy to Clean,"Most of the hand blenders I've had were a pain to clean and became clogged when trying to blend soups. This one, on the other hand is very easy to clean. It may not have the most power, but that's a quibble. That it's easy to clean is why I'm liking it."
4,Worked well untilit didn't anymore.,It worked well until it didn't anymore. Two speed which was adequate for me. But a month ago it just quit. It lasted almost 4 years blending protein smoothies.
1,Can't recommend this one,I owned mine for almost one year. I actually used it for about 4 months. I recently pulled it out of the drawer and got half way through making a frozen drink when it locked up on me. I bought a more expensive KitchenAid and it has way out performed this one so far.
2,too weak for smoothies,The motor isn't strong enough to make a smoothie with crushed ice without lumps and chunks.
4,"Good at mixing, but a little awkward","I agree with all the reviews that praise this little appliance's ability to blend, but find it a little cumbersome. I used it daily for a few weeks to mix flaxseed oil and cottage cheese into a yogurt-like consistency (takes a couple minutes to get them really blended with no oiliness remaining), and then blend in berries and other fruit. I find the handle kind of big and uncomfortable to hold, and the whole thing a bit heavy if you need to mix for more than a few seconds. It was also NOT easy cleaning this sludge out of the blades after mixing. I've switched to a small food processor to make this concoction now. However, for other uses, these things weren't an issue and the blender works great.As far as storage goes, the blender is very top-heavy and with the cord coming out the top, I find that if I just stand it on the counter it tends to fall over easily. A small stand or wall-hanger would be great, but it didn't come with one."
1,"A Dangerous book recommending a dangerous type of ""therapy""","As a survivor much damaged by multiple electroshocks inflicted upon me against my will, I am frightened that people could read this book and , thinking that electroshock might help them, actually decide to undergo the treatment. I did not feel that the author adequately conveyed the risks of the treatment, nor the body of literature by fellow professionals opposed to the practice."
5,excellent,"This book is a must for those in clinical depression. She presents a real human being, a psychologist, wife, mother of a daughter, catholic, who descends into depression at 38. For those recovering, she illuminates and helps clarify where we have been and how it may have begun. Her recovery after a year-and-a-half is marvelously told in grim triumph. from: garth minegar"
5,A glorious coffee table book,"I picked this up several years ago when it was first published and boy am I glad I did! Anyone who knows the history of the golden age of Hollywood is well aware that MGM waqs the top studio with the most glamorous, mythical stars like Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, and others. It offers rare and beautiful photos from the silent era and its beginnings all the way to 1959. Includes gossipy tidbits and much more! I hope they bring this book back on the market!"
1,Skip this book and go to the source...,"Dr. Cutler barely mentions the acupuncurist from whom she learned her methods, but it was probably Dr. Devi Nambudripad or someone trained by her. So skip the copier and get your information from the woman who discovered a way to truly eliminate all allergies, not just food sensitivities. Her book, Say Goodbye To Illness, is packed full of testimonials, some which include phone numbers and email addresses, which are truly miraculous. She also has a research foundation which has verified the effectiveness of her method, which is called NAET. Nambudripad's materials are much more comprehensive, and there are a lot more NAET practitioners around the country than there are BioSet practitioners. Dr. Cutler does talk more about diet and enzymes than NAET does, but it is also old info you could get in any natural healing book. I am disappointed I wasted my time on this book and will stick with NAET."
4,The Cure I've Been Looking For,"When I heard Dr. Ellen Cutler on a local radio station, it only took me a few minutes to decide to order this book. It took two days to arrive and only two minutes to tear open the box and start learning about BioSET. I've since had my first appointment with a BioSET practitioner, and the explanations in the book made it very easy to understand what he was doing to me and why. After years of being told just to avoid the foods I'm allergic to (unfortunately, that means everything but eggs)I am thrilled to learn from Dr. Cutler that there is a cure. I would definitely recommend this book to people with food allergies or to parents of children with ADD or ADHD."
2,Boring...,"Bought this to play with my 5 year old daughter, but it's not fun. You basically put all the cards in a pile, take turns turning them over real fast and whoever sees a set of 3 matching cards first grabs them quickly and keeps them. Whoever has the most cards at the end wins. The monsters look similar, so obviously it takes more time for my 5 year old to scout out a matching 3 than it does me. I basically have to sit there and pretend I don't see a set, so she can get some cards too. No fun if you have to throw the game everytime, and it's not much fun for her to just be looking for matches the whole game anyway. Spend alittle more and buy something better. We enjoy ""Guess Who"", ""Headbandz"" and ""Monopoly Junior"" as some examples."
5,A Favorite,"I read this multiple times as a child, and I've read it multiple times as an adult. I can't make it through more than a couple consecutive chapters without crying. Still."
5,"Fun, Funky, Feel-good, Fusion, Future, Anasmic","This is a fun, funky, feel-good DVD. It has a feel-good warm-up with some kick-butt strengthening moves.This is an intermediate to advanced program, as you are expected to know basic belly dance moves, and you are introduced to hip-hop concepts and movements.The instructional portion breaks down locking, popping, tutting and waving and shows how to incorporate the moves into belly dance fusion. It will take some time to do this program as it has 2 dvds of warm-up, instruction and demonstration, but you will have fun doing it!If you are looking to add hip-hop fusion to your belly dance repetoire, this is the DVD to start with. The performance section is fascinating and beautifully executed. You are sure to enjoy this one!"
4,Cool,"This is a cool and kind of bad ass DVD. I was a little disappointed that it was so focused on belly dance, and not quite as much popping and locking... and cool swagga lessons... but really this DVD is what it says it is. And it's fun."
2,Loved the RC ads.,I totally disagree with MUSIC FAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA USA. I think the RC Cola ads are the best part of this video. Its the rest that gets a bit on your nerves.
3,Laughing with Nancy,"Not badly made, ahead of its time, music video after music video featuring Nancy showing off those legs and million dollar smile. First five songs are worth a listen and watch. You'll laugh, you'll wonder how this ever came into existence. She's a much better singer than 'Boots were made for Walking' displayed. Royal Crown Cola commercials themselves almost worth the price of admission. Disappointing appearances by Dean Martin, Sammy Davis and Frank Sinatra. I'm not sure if this is just because they're all dead now, but I think its just that they're boring segments....maybe if they had let Sammy sing rather than just dance?! Never recovers after that till the very end when she hops back on the hot air balloon. She was SUCH a hotty!"
3,Forget the camp,"Buy this DVD for one reason; Frank singing ""Younger than Springtime"" to his daughter Nancy. Here is a man at the pinnacle of his profession, in marvelous voice, floating through a beautifully arranged song. An added bonus is that we get to see the recording process as the song is sung and later played back to Frank and Nancy in the recording studio. Man, you just feel like you are part of the process. I can here the Chairman himself probably saying, ""Coo Coo baby."""
3,Why Stop? Texas Roadside Markers,Book was received quickly. Book looked to be new but had several inside pages (approx. 10) that the printer had cut short so they were not the same length as the other pages in book.
2,Hard to use,It's all in there but the index is by sign number and not by city or location. So you have to stop to look at the sign in order to figure out where it is in the book?
3,needs a map-based index,"Every word of every historical marker - nice idea. But the markers are in alphabetical order by whatever the nearest tiny little town may be. The book desperately needs some sort of map system whereby you can look up all of the markers in a given region, say. I'm glad I got this book out of the library, so I can give it back."
5,Just plain perfect!,"I am so excited that I found this book. When traveling through Texas, I am always interested in the Historical Markers. However, I have a husband that drives from point A to point B, without any stops in between! Because of that, I have asked for a book that would have everything listed that I am always wanting to stop and read. I finally found this book and could not wait to get it. It came just in time for Christmas and one of our annual road trips! No complaints! Perfect in every way. Certainly worth the money, and easy to read. Very to the point, so if you want to read more on the historical marker...do the research! Thank you so much for taking the time to write a book like this and making my life so much easier!"
2,It needs either more or less,"The first thing I wanted to do when I got this book was look up historical markers near my hometown and my current city. I was disappointed to find that the book did not include any of those markers. I learned after-the-fact that the book contains only about 2,500 of the 11,000 historical markers in the state (the numbers are from memory, so may be off).So the book is not comprehensive enough to be a good reference guide, but it is also too reference-like to be readable as a book. It needs to be one or the other. If it is not going to be exhaustive, then there should be some editorializing, with actually fewer markers included (the most interesting or unique ones, with maybe a comment about each). But I guess that's just a different book altogether."
3,Why Stop! TX Roadsie Markers,I thought it would be more up to date but it isn't. There were numerous historical markers that were not noted. Maybe they have come out with a more up to date one. Otherwise the book is informative.
5,DVD-The Mandolin and Bouzouki of Tim O'Brien,Not what I expected. Record is for tutorial purposes for which I have no use.
4,I want this album on CD,"I, too, want this album on CD. I have all the others, but not this one, which should be on someone's remaster/reissue schedule. I'm curious...is there anyone rich enough or stupid enough to pay the ridiculous prices some sellers ask for out-of-print CDs? If there are people like that, I have hundreds of old CDs I would sell for a hundred dollars each.I should add that this is a very good album and well worth the price a remastered CD would bring."
2,CD mailing,I love my Cd. Although dissapointed with the paper packageing. The CD case came to me with a crack in it. The Cd was fine and the price I paid was happy that it was fine. The sender should mail CD's in CD mailers or a small padded box.
3,You can do better,"I bought an OEM version of this mouse from another vendor for next to nothing. The only thing different about it is that it didn't come with the normal packaging or the logitech logo on the top of the mouse.Overall the mouse is okay. Installation is simple and the mouse itself works well for most things. I have two complaints about it though. The first is that it doesn't fit very well in my hand compared to some of the other mice in the marketplace. The second is that the mouse creaks and groans as you move it.The bottom line when picking a mouse is to find one that you find comfortable to your hand and then buy that one. If I had to do it over again, I would have still gone with logitech, but just a different model."
2,Not a very good mixer,"This mixer seemed ok at first but once i started using it to mix cookie dough it went downhill. It started to smell like something was burning up. It was the mixer, i guess it's not made to handle the thing we use it for most (cookies). It's just cheap mixer that's all. Would not recomend. Spend a little bit more to get one that really works!"
1,It's not worth 5 dollars,"This mixer was purchased from Walmart for an annual, one-time use (Christmas Cookies). After the flour was added to the mix it died.I guess the motor burned out or something...maybe you could use it if you had a recipe that only used runny batter, but I thought a basic mixer should be able to handle a batch of cookies.If you buy this, you will be wasting your valuable time as you'll have to take it back to the store before you even get one thing done with it.No move Rival products for me. Next time I'll cough up the extra $20 for Black and Decker."
5,T* witches #7,I haven't read this book yet but i know it will be very very good because the series so far has been the bomb! Every time she makes a new one its better than the one before it. So take my advice and read this series!!!I recomend the series Avalon:web of magic its also a great series!
5,t-witches#6,this book is the best book so far because Cam and Alex or otherwise known as Appola and Artimiss finaly get to see and talk to their mother Maranda.Also their are some secrets and tradegies revield.
2,Runs small--non-standard sizing,"Seems the bands on the Playtex bras run smaller than those on other standard brands like Bali or Vanity Fair. Couldn't even close it, and have to return this and another Playtex style I bought."
3,Review of the Black Bra ok,Was not quite the right fit for the size it was suppose to be. Will not order this again. okay
2,very uncomfortable :,the bra straps is so short and tugs in my shoulders would not be comfort for anytime for me I reordered a larger size and it was the same with the straps and then the cups were too large.
4,Nice bra but too much padding for me.,"This looked like a nice bra in the picture, but it had way too much padding for me and I was looking for a bra to wear in the hot AS summer weather. Might be great for a winter bra in colder climates."
5,great support and coverage,Love this bra. Great support and full coverage. Very well thought out structure at the back...smooths out back and makes everything look wonderful! Very happy customer! ;-)
2,something is wrong,"so i ordered this after reading an article on exactly how a bra is supposed to fit and i saw that other reviews on this bra were pretty good. this was my first mail order bra experience. first thing i thought when i received the bra is that the fabric seemed kinda flimsy and cheap. the fit was the WORST, the cups were smaller than my double D bra's and the area between the the 2 cups poked out and forward, it is supposed to lay flat against your chest and separate your boobs, instead it looked like uni-boob...not good. i think bra's are one thing you really need to buy in a store and try on prior to purchasing. even if you buy a bra identical to one you already have, the same bra may be made in different countries and the fit will differ. i do have to say that the return was very easy."
3,It's a bra!,"Always in search of comfort for the girls, but alas, this one doesn't cut it for me. I think it's the underwire mostly. It does stay put and there is no slippage, but by the middle of the day the underwire digs in. I'll try another Playtex style."
4,Bra is excellent! Good support.,The No Ride Up really works!. I wear 38C. Also it's comfortable and the fabrics are super durable! I never have time to hand wash bras!
5,"This is an excellent book, and you don't even have to care about China to enjoy it.","This is an excellent book, and you don't even have to care about China to enjoy it. It's about a man's life and his search for meaning and purpose. Well-written, honest, much ground covered. I enjoyed reading of the games he and his siblings invented during their childhood. It's not so traumatic being poor if you don't know you're poor, okay? Li reminded me of that.This is also the first ""China book"" I've read since THE PRIVATE LIFE OF CHAIRMAN MAO by Dr. Li Zhisui. I love the perspective. Chairman Mao, Madame Mao, etc. are distant background figures in Chinese autobiographies, but I feel like I've been ""behind the scenes"" with Dr. Li and know what's going on better than the Chinese do. It's great."
5,Emotionally powerful and well written,"Li's book ws an amazing journey through his life. Given that I was playing in the Houston Ballet Orchestra when he came to the US and Houston, it was especially enlightening to me because I really had no idea what was going on in his life at the time; I only saw the superb dancing and a very nice individual. Lois Kannwischer"
2,It's not a Mandarin Chinese Edition,"Dear Seller,I don't mind if it is an English version. But you should remove 'Mandarin Chinese Edition' at least!"
1,Boooooooooooooring,"Wow, this book was so boring. If you are into books that put you to sleep in an instant, feel free to give a spin. However, if you have any common sense then skip it! Especially the jail part."
1,took FOREVER,"I needed this book for a book club read. When I ordered it on June 30 said it would arrive on July 8...a bit longer than my other books I ordered, but I went ahead as I knew I would have enough time to read it. But it did not arrive until July 13. I now had 6 days to read the book. I was not happy. I would never order from bookcloseouts-us again. I have ordered books many times through Amazon and never had them take that long. Book was in good condition and the story is good."
2,He Was Wrong to Defect,"I'm going to express a contrarian view.The Chinese communist government certainly had to be difficult to live under. But if it weren't for that government, Li Cunxin never would have been picked from obscurity as a rural peasant to learn ballet. He would have spent the rest of his life as a peasant, never knowing fame and luxury, never knowing anything but hunger and hard work. I firmly believe he was wrong to defect, and because I believe that, it was hard for me to see this man in a sympathic light, and therefore it was hard for me to enjoy this book."
5,Mao's last dancer,"Anyone interested in memoire literature, history, political science, athletics, dance, and U.S.-China relations can learn a great deal from this inspiring book. Even athletes who do not live in a system that pulls youngsters from their homes at a very young age for intensive physical training will appreciate the intensity, dedication, resistance, and eventual success of the hero of this heart-warming memoire."
5,Memoir Full of Charm and Heart,"An endearing portrait of a dancer who finds success against all odds, told in a warm, funny, and elegant voice."
1,THE KINDLE EDITION IS NOT THE FULL BOOK,"There are two versions of this book advertised on the Kindle page. One says, ""Mao's Last Dancer, Young Reader's Edition."" The other says, ""Mao's Last Dancer"". They are BOTH Young Readers Editions. I wasted $12 on this book. I contacted Amazon about the problem was they didn't understand what the problem was. Oh, well...."
4,An amazing political story.,"It begins in 1961 .. not back in the 20's or 30's, when it would have been easier to believe such poverty was possible. Right there in the 60's, when our generation here in America was protesting and ignorantly embracing Communism! Really made me realize that it was a spoiled, selfish generation, that had no idea what oppression and lack of freedom was really like. This book removes the rose-colored glasses of what it is like to live under a totalitarian government."
4,An excellent book for young children,"The book is an excellent book for children about ten years old. It gives a picture of life in China, both rural and city life and also, if it follows the movie, it will give information about his dancing and movement to the United States. There is an adult edition, but Amazon doesn't seem to have it."
3,Too much information,"This is a book club selection and not one of my favorites. There is too much detail in the beginning chapters and I kept wishing the author would just get ""on with the story"". There are several versions...mine was the movie version. One of the other book club members has the edition for young readers and it left out a lot of the details that were so repetitive. However, she was not very enthused about her version either. I guess I have read an overload of books on China, Mao's revolution and the suffering of the people in the past few years so was bored by this one."
5,Mao's Last Dancer,This book has given me a better understanding of what life was and is like in China. A must read for everyone who thinks that communism and socialism is a better way to live than the freedoms we enjoy in the United States.
5,First Review - Mao's Last Dancer,"When this book first hit the retail market it didn't interest me. My choice of reading material was Crime related. Recently I saw a Documentary on the life of Li Cunxin and that he had gained a position with The Queensland Australia Ballet in the capacity of Director.I immediately obtained the book, 'Mao's Last Dancer' from Kindle Amazon and spent the following few days enjoying his story. Excellent read, thoroughly enjoyable."
4,buy this!,if you like Yo La Tengo you WILL dig this. release negotiable instruments from your emergency fund to immediately secure a copy of this audible extravaganza...
2,"Good start - nice try, try again.","Fuzzy Low-fi with too much synth, sounds good for one song, but gets a bit monotnous. Vocals are reminiscent of Peter Gabriel but the music is not as dynamic. Good effort, too much drum machine or something... just my humble opinion. I expected more from Touch and Go."
3,Interesting,"I saw these kids live and was mighty impressed. Thinking for sure their new CD would be just as good, i bought it. I was wrong. Although the CD has a few gems in it (i.e. Dreams and Ambulance especially) I'm afraid this recording lacks much of the energy and enthusiasm I experienced during their live performance. I think having more live drums along side the drum programming could have made this album a little more exciting to listen to. Check out their live show, but think twice before buying this album. Look for a live recording if you can."
2,TVOTR,"I was introduced to these guys about a half a year ago, so I went out and bought the album. However, I've only listened to it once since then and haven't really had anything motivating me to listen to it more than once. It's nothing impressive, not to say that you can hear it elsewhere. I'm still not sure why these guys are popular. Maybe it's the soul influence. I certainly respect the music that these guys make, but its tediousness and lack of instrumentation will turn off people that want their music full and complex."
2,Wildly over rated!,"From Brooklyn myself, there are loads of bands regurgitating simplistic, non-catchy, synth meets poor guitar work ballads about the lost and lonely artists of the world, and in this case Williamsburg. This band has been blown out of proportion without the talent to back them up. I'm ashamed of touch and go records... I mean it would be one thing if they were good live, but there not! Uggh, when will music matter over style? Did I mention TV on the Radio did a fashion spread to promote their album?"
2,I'm so out of touch with other music writers,"OK, sure, I only do it part time, but I can't see why this album has made it on to so many end of the year ""best"" lists. It's as soulless as anything on top 40 radio, even if it is dressed in hipster clothing."
1,SUCK,"It's bands like this who are dragging down the music industry and giving a bad name to bands like Radiohead Sigur Ros and the like with their ""art""."
4,truly great,"TV on the Radio is a band that feels like they are still on the way up creatively. Their first EP was totally brilliant --- this album is great but perhaps less than brilliant ---- but I have a feeling what comes next will blow them up into a huge band. Their music sounds new to me and it is full of soul --- a refreshing change in the indie scene. There are songs on this album that are unusual sounding sonically, but they don't sound forced or weird for the sake of weird.I am anxious to see a live show andhear how this music translates live."
4,Post post rock,"Absorbing feature introduction to one of modern rock's most promising indie upstarts, DY is afforded a more natural fluidity later consciously challenging material can elude."
3,Unmemorable,"When I started listening about this album and the first couple of songs started sounding on the radio, I dislike it.Later, right after they won the shortlist award, I though of listen it again to see if I had missed something. In deed, there was something complex and enigmatic about the album. So I followed my instincts and bought the CD.I played it a few times and the magic started to disappear. It faded to Arcade Fire's Funeral and Nada Surf's Let Go, which I bought simultaneously.There's creativity and feeling within the songs, but they all lack of that crucial moment that turn a song sublime and worthy to be repeated for days and days."
4,Die Brücke ( The Bridge),"I had seen this film way back in the 50s in Germany with our school class and wanted to show it now to my second husband who is English. I had told him often about this particular scene on the bridge, where you can hear the American tank approach. It still left me sitting on the edge of the chair. A very powerful film, had lost nothing of it's fascination in the 50 years, since I had seen it last.The DVD came before the estimated time, thank you very much for your prompt service."
5,great movie,"I first saw this movie in 1960 when I went to Paris on leave from Germany. It was in German with French subtitles so I was glad to be able to get a copy with English subtitles. I was really upset at that time when the audience cheered everytime an American got shot.Th officer wasn't trying to save the boys, he was afraid they would run & start a rout so he wanted to get rid of them.The boys had had quite a bit of military training in the Hitler Jungend so they had more than just the one day the movie shows.The beginning of the movie may be a bit slow for some but it was very interesting."
4,Little to add except...,"Others here have already detailed what a fine (anti)war film Die Bruecke is and why. I can only echo those sentiments: this is a gripping film that really makes you think about militarism and war and their costs. I did find one unfortunate problem with this particular release of the film: the subtitles are at times wrong, but more often they cut and simplify the dialogue and seemingly make little attempt to recreate its nuances. On the bright side, this film isn't heavily rooted in dialogue: the plot and images speak louder than words and get the messages across as clear as day. Still, it would be nice to see this film re-released with better subtitling."
5,Om Namah Sivaya,"This is a very popular series that aired on the Indian television in 1997. The stories in these episodes are about God Siva and related stories from Hindus scriptures. Actor Samar Jai Singh has done a wonderful job of playing God Siva. The music and dances are fantastic. One of the best episodes is Parvati's wedding. Excellent script, very thoughtful direction, Indian television has aired many truly great classics, and Om Namah Sivaya is one of them. The series was made into DVD in 2003. The dialogue was dubbed into various Indian languages, with English subtitles."
4,Informative and human,"This account of the Hmong script created by Shong Lue Yang for his people is a strangely Christ-like tale which reads at times like an adventure novel, but you never forget it is true. Smalley, a Baptist minister, remains fashionably objective in his telling of the story. Useful for linguistics classes and anyone interested in the origin of writing systems."
1,"If three men wrote it, then it must be true...","There is a saying in Chinese that if one man sees a tiger in the market alone then it is not true, but if a second man sees it too, then perhaps it may be true but if a third man sees a tiger in the market then, it must be true. Thus, ""mother of writing"" for the Hmong is like VERY SIMILAR to this Chinese proverb. Since more than three people have seen it then it must be true, especially, two of the authors are Hmong and one is a non-Hmong author. But for me, I would beg to be differ from this proverb. If we were to sit and analyze the whole writing system developed by so called the ""mother of writing,"" we will find that the characters are very similar to other writing systems around the region of Asia countries including the former USSR/Russia. Thus, I read this book as a fairytale, nothing more for this particular subject."
5,The Boyfriend Clinic,I loved this book. When I had a boy problem I looked in the book and it helped me. I am so happy I bought it years ago.
5,Gift.,This was a Christmas gift for someone who enjoys Shakespeare and when the person opened it - excited and happy to get this.
4,King of Fools,"This book taught: That leaders of kingdoms are often fools, you cannot seek love from others, fools die alone with nothing to show for their lives, and more."
5,Large Book,"I liked this book because it was much larger than the normal size of a Folger Shakespeare Library book. It provided ample amounts of space for notes and the text went along with most copies of King Lear, at times providing more text."
3,An old fool learns too little too late,"An annoying old fool named King Lear doesn't know the true character of his own children. He divides all of his property between his two disloyal daughters simply because they flatter him, and he gives nothing to his loyal daughter because she refuses to play the flattery game. In retrospect I can't blame the two flatterers for their behavior, considering that their father is an obnoxious fool. He gets his just desserts in the end - the short end of the stick. So there's a happy ending after all. Shakespeare wrote it with sympathy for the old king. He excuses arrogance in kings. I don't. The hell with King Lear."
2,The author is confused,"While I enjoyed PARTS of this play, I thought Mr. Shakespeare was a little confused about the central nature of love and compasion. Its still an interestingread, though. I recommend thatyou buy it, despite its nebulous approach toward life and love."
5,Don't let the price fool you...,"I'm using this as a more portable version of the same plays in Norton's Shakespeare by Greenblatt, which is too darn big to lug around conveniently. So I ordered the Dover plays at their cheap price for convenience. Don't let the price make you think they aren't worth much. They are great for taking notes in and contain all the information I need. I can always look online for more info if I need it. These are a great bargain. Norton's Shakespeare by Greenblatt is the best, yes, but it's seriously like 12 lbs or so....and not cheap."
5,King Lear,"The book I ordered was for a World Lit class. I was afraid it wouldn't make it to me in time, but I received it a considerable amount of time before it was due. The condition of it was better than expected and it was a good read."
4,"Review of the Signet edition of Shakespeare's ""King Lear""","This paperback is a handy edition of Shakespeare's great play, useful for students on all levels. The critical essays in the back are helpful, though one or two more recent ones could have been included."
3,"""Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude...""","Ok - it's Shakespeare: points awarded. But I found myself loving the word play immensely. I was scratching notes in the columns - started my own word count when I found patterns... and then (as this was read for school) went head-first into the analytical essay to be written. Oddly - the instructor now has us working on a research paper which asks, ""Did Shakespeare write Shakespeare?""And a NOTE: I always wait to read any prologues or introductions AFTER I've read a text. I don't want the ""authoritative voice"" in the intro influencing my take on the book. But I do read them AFTER. This intro by Russell Fraser has to be the most inane blather I've found yet. It directly cops lines out of the play. And Fraser just makes himself giddy by musically rearranging words and paragraphs to no particular point - it is the sound of ones insides turning themselves out. As Goneril put it - ""Good sir, to th' purpose."""
4,A Tragedy with Modern Implications,"With many people living much longer than they did in Shakespeare's timeand their children putting them in ratty nursing homeswhere they are usually or even generally treated badlyand given the minimum of nursing care... going theremainly to die, this play has something to say to modern man.We like his daughters too often betray our patents andthey so often mistake our good intentions.Is madness the cost of old age? Are greed andenvy any less despicable in modern children thanthey were in the children of kings?We all live better than the kings of the past in America today,but treat our elderly worse than even the worst impoverished of Shakespeare's time.And we still have homeless mad people ( like Edgar pretends to be)on our streets and back roads. We haven't learned any lessons from our literature."
2,like a bad love affair....,"I received my Rival ice cream maker as a Christmas present and it was love at first sight. Of course, being the dead of winter, I didn't use it much until the following Spring. However, by July, it began to over-heat before finishing a simple vanilla. I probably got six uses out of that sucker before it began having 'issues'. What started as mutual admiration ended in bitter recriminations."
1,Ugh.. back to Salt and Ice. Don't Waste Your Money!,"I had one of these little gel canister deals about 10 years ago. Didn't work. Bought one that uses rock slat and ice. Worked like a charm. I had to replace it recently, and bought this gel canister ice cream maker.What a waste of money. As I write this, I am at attempt number 2 at making ice cream in this useless device. The stuff is not even remotely frozen. The canister was in the freezer, upright, in a plastic bag per instructions all night. The ice cream mix that I made yesterday (not the junk from the company but actual food) chilled in the fridge overnight.I don't have ice cream, or even a soft serve. I have fruity, eggy, milky gloup.And yes, ice cream should freeze in an ice cream maker, enough so that the machine can't run anymore. If this company has convinced you that anything less than a frozen soft serve is ice cream you have been scammed. Returning this and buying an older, more tried-and-true, ice cream maker."
2,Incompetent Engineering,"Just found the ""Sunbeam"" version of this on closeout. Now I know why: the motor runs backwards. The directions say it should turn clockwise and if it doesn't -- <em>turn it off, wait 20 minutes and try again</em>.How can you not manage something as simple as making the motor turn the right direction???Anyhow, after 3 tries, it has consistently turned the wrong way.And, yes, it matters. When the paddles turn backwards, they don't scrape the freezing cream off the edges of the canister and you end up with vanilla soup. And I know this because.. I'm a lefty, and once botched a batch of hand-cranked ice cream by turning the crank the wrong way for 20 minutes."
1,Get something else,"I've made home made ice cream for years in my Donvier hand crank ice cream maker. I decided several years ago that I wanted to try an electric one. I've tried the Rival several times over the last few years, but with no luck. The ice cream just doesn't freeze. This weekend I tried an experiment. I froze the buckets to both ice cream makers. I made a 2 quart batch of strawberry ice cream. I poured 1/2 the mixture into each bucket and then froze them side by side. This next part makes absolutely no sense to me, but this is what happened. The Rival ice cream never thickened to anything more than a slightly thick custard base. The stuff in the Donvier froze to the consistency of slightly less than a soft serve. So, after putting the stuff from the Donvier into the freezer, we had a fairly creamy ice cream. We put the stuff in the Rival in the freezer and it froze, but had a lot of ice crystals. Not nearly as creamy. Go figure."
4,"""When you wake up from a hypnogogic state""","""I asked for a world/ made wholly of hands./ Oh that. That's a million/ birds as yet unformed. Ten thousand tongues."" Cole Swenson's Noon is hypnogogic in its repetitions, in its turnings (I imagine whirling dervishes with broad, conical skirts perfectly flared). Her poems speak of the world's body as itself, not as ""standing for"" anything other. In this world, there are borders and bodies (faces, hands, lips)and birds-falling, curving, flying. In this world, ""When something is in the very process of shattering all internal conflicts cease."" Evocative, mesmerizing poetry that requires quiet for its reading."
4,great show,"I missed this episode when the show was on tv. I enjoyed it a lot. When General Hammond releases information about the Stargate program to other world leaders, he encounters opposition -- not as much from the foreign leaders as from a US senator. Highlights of the dangers and accomplishments of the Stargate program (from earlier episodes) are shown during this episode. I enjoyed seeing them. I especially enjoyed the ending."
4,Solid episodes but the extras...sigh,"Why only 4 stars? Because the Region 2 dvd set gets more extras! How fair is that? I actually went and bought a multi-region dvd player (through Amazon) and then headed over to the Amazon.co.uk site to buy this season. (Region 2 dvds will NOT play in a Region 1--U.S.--dvd player.) And yes, the Region 2 boxed set came with more. Parts 1 and 2 of the Lowdown (which included 15 minutes added footage from what originally aired), as well as Richard Dean Anderson's video diary from Paradise Lost. Offhand, that's what I noticed, although there may be more than that. When a dvd is released, it should offer the same extras, no matter what region it is."
1,Another clips-show,"This is yet another throw-away episode. This episode was made to ""catch"" new viewers up to the plot over the previous 5.5 seasons. I'm a big Gate fan, and I can't stand clip shows... usually because I watch in marathons, and don't need to be reminded of the plot points."
4,More of the Same....Great!!,"If you love the characters , action and good special effects.... this is more of the same that keeps the ""Fans"" coming back for more."
3,Miss Daniel Jackson!,"Season Six and Season Ten were the worst seasons of Stargate SG-1. Not only did we miss out on Daniel Jackson (for the most part), having an ""alien"" like Jonas Quinn that was more American than the Russian team members in ""Metamorphosis"" was inexcusable. In that episode, by the way, the Russians pass through the Stargate and still speak Russian. (If the stargate programmed one's speech, or language, to match the worlds to which it was connected, it should have made the Russians perfectly easy to understand once they had passed through its event horizon.) But the Russians couldn't communicate with the world's inhabitants while the Americans could.The best episodes were the ones with guest appearances by Michael Shanks. Jonas pulled down the season, but it's still worth owning, even if one has to swallow an ""American"" alien.Dumb idea, but the show recovered and even survived the addition of the insufferable Ben Browder and Claudia Black, who, unlike Browder, grew on you."
2,The most boring season,"If you're a new Stargate fan, my advice is to skip season 6 and go directly to season 7. Catch it on TV if you get the chance, but if you don't, you won't miss much. I watched each season 6 episode through once on TV, and even though I can rewatch every other season over and over again, I have no desire to see season 6 six again. There are a few good episodes in, like Abyss, but far too many dull, pointless ones, like the X-Files rip-off Nightwalkers.It's the only season I skipped buying the DVDs for. I suggest you do the same."
1,"""Darwin would be crushed""",There is no reason to make up alternatives to Darwinian evolution. They chose to write this which is practically a crime. Why do TV sci-fi writers have such problems with Darwinian evolution?The guest characters are all okay.
5,Great DVD,I still have a few episodes to go but I sure love this show. There is always an adventure when you go through the gate.
5,almost bored with it : ),i have watched it over and over again til i am almost bored with watching the whole series. : ) but not just yet.
5,Great Show,My husband loves Stargate SG1 and he needed this season but the last three. I got a good deal buying this from Amazon.It is a great show and my husband got me hooked on them too. I really wish the character of Jonas could have stuck around longer then this season. I thought he fit well with the others...
5,stargate sg1- season 6,i got my order on time and it was in great condition.i would buy from this seller again.
5,Wonderful!,"Sg1 Season 6 It is great. Order it and came real fast. Sg1 is my best show ever, Richard Dean Anderson make the whole show. We just watch back to back."
3,Can I give 5 stars to 3 episodes?,"I'm a purist. I don't apologize for that. For me the sixth season of Stargate wasn't Stargate SG1. I own three disks containing the episodes Abyss, Changeling, and Full Circle. The team of SG1 isn't a team without the four characters of Jack, Daniel, Teal'c, and Sam. Season six failed to capture my interest with the rebuild of the team. There simply wasn't any chemistry to get me past the weaker episodes or to allow me to ignore the hole where Daniel belonged. The hammer to the head push of the new character just made things worse. So, for me, season six consists of three episodes where SG1 was all present and accounted for."
2,not the best season,"I really hated that corin nemec guy,hes soo annoying.But its stargate and it was a good try, lol"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz,"That's pretty much it. I fell asleep for most of the episodes.Without Daniel Jackson, the show fell apart. Boring, bland, plot holes you could drive that ugly spaceship through...yuck.Save your money!(It's too bad you can't just order the episodes you want on one DVD. Because with four episodes per disc, you could have Abyss, Changeling, the Maybourne episode and Full Circle (without the last five minutes) and not miss a thing from the end of season five to the beginning of season seven.)"
4,Grab-bag,"The usual mix of excellent to so-so episodes with one real stinker: Disclosure. This season has one of my personal favorites: Sight Unseen. If you're an SG1 fan, however, you'll savor them all. Even Disclosure gives the late, great Don Davis a chance to work his General Hammond character. That alone is worth a watch."
3,Way past tired of O'Neil pictured as a moron.,Way over way under way beside way gone way bologna way micrometer way subtrahend way extemporaneous way incredibly way past it.
2,Throw us a bone...,"This was better than the first half. McKay was a spot of humor the show desperately needed, but not sufficient. Ryac and O'Neill saved the day. That's the problem. Just another tedious victory."
4,Nice Hammer movie,"Overall, good zombie movie. Arguments and action take place in a very fluid manner so you will not get bored. Good scenery as you might expect from most Hammer productions. Very nice clamshell packing with photos and extra information on the backside of the cover. In my opinion, main flaw of this movie lies in the idea of somebody creating and then using zombies as a slave working force in mining exploitation. Thus zombies are somewhat domesticated by a ""master creator"" and his collaborators, which remains a little bit unconvincing. The more classic idea of achieving eternal existence could have been used instead as the main argument to justify the actions of the bad guy. Anyway, good movie for any old horror movie fan."
4,Plague of the Zombies,"It's impossible to give a Hammer-style film a 5 star review but this one is pretty good. Atmospheric and dreamlike, it is only let down by a poor turn by John Carson as the villian of the piece and by the usual Hammer lack of pace. Andre Morell is a sympathetic lead and the zombie scenes are ahead of their time (George Romero has obviously seen this film.) A classic of the genre."
3,Correct format ?.,"It's a very nice film, but something is odd. -When you watch the trailer for the movie, you'll notice that it's presented in the scope format; revealing more picture information at the sides, than what you saw while watching the movie itself. If they filmed it in Techniscope (or Hammerscope, if you will), why the heck didn't Hammer originally,(and Anchor Bay now) release it that way ?. Still, it's a good film."
4,These guys could work for Kathie Lee,"Forget the Kooky end to this well laid out Hammer classic. The eerie countryside, the mysterious mood of the town folk, and the sinister squire create the atmospheric horror synonomous with Hammer.The hair stands on the back of your neck during a fantastic graveyard dream sequence. Lots of voodoo and strange events lead up to a very different end. Don't forget to watch the origional trailers included with the widescreen version... It's a hoot!"
5,EXCELLENT,"REALLY PLEASENT MUSIC REGARDINGH NATURE SOIUNDS, IT GIVES RELAXING MOMENTS AND GRATEFULLY SENSATINOS."
1,Internal plastic gear broke after only 1 month,"I Received the unit and used it everyday for 1 month. It made great shaved ice from just ice cubes but then it stopped working. The motor turned but the ice cube holder didn't. I disassembled it to see why it stopped working and found a maze of cheap plastic gears inside, one of which was cracked in 2 pieces. I don't recommend it for durability."
4,Great for garage sales!!,"I got this at Wal-mart for about $20. I use it for garage sales and make more than $15 each day. The shaved ice is VERY hard to get out of the container without spilling any ice. VERY noisy for garage sales so I am looking for a new snow cone machine. It's easy to use and a kid could do it. Takes 5-6 minutes to shave ice for about 2 medium sized snowcones while other machines for about $10 more can make 10 snowcones. Overall, good machine for small events and beginners. Also, I wish their was a place to put the snowcones though but this is what you get for $20."
2,Another broken machine!,"I bought my ice shaver in June and loved it. My husband and I had snowcones every evening. I even took it on vacation so I could share it with my grandkids. A couple of nights ago I was making our evening snowcone and it just stopping working. I took it apart twice and could not see a problem but when I started it back up it just whined loudly! I suppose if you were planning to make snowcones a couple of times each summer this would be ideal but, because the company apparently skimped on something to make this more durable, I ended up with landfill. This was a good idea but something is missing!"
1,Disappointing ice shaver,"We used this shaver for one summer... just a few months. We didn't use it every day but for the time we used it we were satisfied. Having the enclosed tray to catch the shaved ice was perfect, hardly any mess. Especially since I saw the mess grandma's shaver made that had no tray to catch the shaved ice. But then it quit working altogether. The inside motor turned but the ice holder wouldn't. I called the company to describe the problem and to see if they had a replacement for that and they didn't. So I had a unit that was basically worthless junk. I tossed it and went for a completely different design. (What a waste of money.) Haven't had my new one too long though so I don't recommend any one just yet.This model (reviewing) NEEDS a better motor and better quality materials to last.So if you get this one, keep in mind that you'll be replacing it by the end of the season."
3,Good soup,"I love clam chowder and never heard of it having shrimp in it. This soup is good. It wasn't just ""soup""...there was a good amount of potatoes and shrimp. The only thing is the shrimp does not have a ""meaty"" texture to it. Imagine a semi soggy cracker. It tasted ok. I wouldn't purchase this again.The thing about buying food over Amazon is that the expiration date is only like 2 months away. Plan to split the food and costs with someone, it'll help."
1,Boring.....,"Add enough spices and more seafood and some sprinkle cheese, and its edible - but why go to so much trouble for a canned product."
4,Good Soup,"At normal price, i would not run out and buy this soup because its nothing real special. Its good tasting quallity soup.The problem: it took amazon 6 weeks to deliver a full case of undamaged soup cans. they were very good about it, because they worked with me, and even refunded money on one case. the fact remains that most of the soup they delivered was damaged. after three cases, i finally received what amounted to 12 good cans of soup."
1,Disappointing Quality Control,"My first ukulele, a Johnson UK-120, was well made and has stood the test of time. Since then, I have purchased other, more expensive instruments. Recently, out of curiosity more than necessity, I purchased the Johnson UK-150. Between ""then and now"", quality control appears to have slipped at Johnson. In addition to flaws in the finish, the bridge broke loose from the top of the ukulele after about a month of occasional playing. A bit of golf club shafting epoxy restored its integrity, but repair work shouldn't be required so soon. Being curious, I looked up other recent reviews of Johnson ukuleles and noted that other people were reporting inconsistent quality control as well. Buyer beware."
5,Still Feels Great after 5 years,"I purchased three of these sheet sets more than 5 years ago at a very good price. One set for my parents and two sets for me. I have no complaints. It still feels great every night. One of my pillow cases is coming apart, but I think the washer or dryer pulled it apart. The rest of my pillow cases are fine."
2,Frightened Pet,I have to say that I bought it for my Yorkie. big mistake. The vibration is too powerful for small dogs and it's heavy! The video that it comes with doesn't even feature the clipper. The dog groomer uses cordless clippers throughout the video. Maybe this clipper would work well for bigger dogs.
5,Great Book,Fantastic book - breaks theory down into very manageable and interesting parts. Easy to read and understand. Does a great job with application - tells you directly what Structuralists vs. Formalists vs. Marxist ACTUALLY do rather than just what they believe. Really helped me in my theory-heavy grad classes.
5,"Great, readable introduction!","This is the fourth or fifth ""introduction"" on literary theory that I have read, and I wish I had read it first! Barry does an excellent job of making clear a subject frequently riddled by difficult neologisms. The best entry point to the entire topic of literary and cultural theory, and one which covers all the major variations, including stylistics."
4,Label and content coincide,"This book addresses all of us that are new to literary theory but want to bring light to the matter. It covers main stream ideas such as liberal humanism, structuralism, psychoanalytic criticism, cultural materialism and even a hint of what stylistics is all about. Its goal is ambitious and in many respects it delivers too broad of an overview. However, Beginning Theory is a surprinsingly easy reading and a good intro to the above mentioned concepts. Each chapter offers a summary of key elements and terms as well as questions and useful pinpointers for further reading thus making reading a dynamic and stimulating experience."
3,Drug Scene,"I bought this film for the simple reason that I think Charlie Spradling is gorgeous. Still, this is a serious film with the serious theme of addiction. Both actors, Charlie Spradling and her real-life husband Jason London, are clearly trying to make a film for grown-ups rather than some lightweight teen flick. She is addicted to alcohol, and he to gambling. The theme guarantees a film with a downer tone and there is a certain soap opera feel about it, but both actors give it their best and I think the film succeeds as a vehicle for actors trying to make a film with a meaningful theme."
1,Egyptian cotton??,I received my Egyptian cotton sheets. The tag says 100% cotton made in India. The package says 100% Egyptian cotton. These sheets do not even feel like the 450 thread count sheets made in India that I bought a year ago. The sheets felt wonderful in the package but after ONE washing that feeling disappeared. I don't know if I received a bad batch or if the single ply yarn is the culprit. These do not even come close to the luxurious feeling the sheets had in the package.
5,A Fem Dom's Opinion,"This book offers an astounding insite into the psycholgy of male submission. It can be dry and acadamian at times, but in depth and based on 40 real life situations. A great read."
2,zzzzzzzz ~,"Didnt do much for me. Rather boring read. Not very creative and I just didnt care for it. Of course, different strokes ~ so....."
3,Worthwhile Read But Serious Flaws,"I'm being generous and giving this book three stars for effort. The author tries hard to give a psychological basis for the supposed reasons for the male desire to be dominated. There are serious errors with her reasoning and claims however. My own research in sexual submissive desires reveals a high correlation with success and stress in men and women. That is, men and women in more stress-filled positions with more responsibilities tend to favor their mate being more sexually dominant. Other research too shows the same result."
5,A fascinating look inside the bedroom of kinky couples,"Just got my copy the other day and this book exceeded my expectations. I can see why it might be controversial in the Bible belt. Cuckolding, strap-on play, feminizing the male, spankings, leather and whips, chastity devices, sexual humiliation, and water sports are some of the topics explored.The author does a great job looking at these sexual practices in a thoughtful and tasteful way. This book is not pornographic but the author does take the reader into the bedroom of real couples and through personal interviews the reader gets to see what goes on behind closed doors.The book also looks at the subject matter from a psychological and sociological perspective but the sexual elements dominate the book."
3,Getting older,"Having seen a Spanish-language version of this show in Mexico City, I was happy that a version of the Broadway show is available on disk. Now, however, I see why Hollywood never sticks exactly to the Broadway version. Recorded, the show drags. The sound is less than perfect. And close-ups of the star reveal her to be a bit elderly for the part. Julie is a knock-out at 60, but hardly convincing as a young London thespian hoping for her first big break."
3,Controversial But OK,"This movie is different from any other I have seen starring Julie Andrews. She does show her ability to portray a character in any role, and her well-known talent is obvious. But, it is not my favorite movie. I will keep it and watch it from time to time, but only because she is the star."
4,"A really fun show, luckily preserved","I was lucky enough, in 1995 to not only see ""Victor/Victoria,"" but to get backstage to meet the lovely and truely gracious Ms. Andrews.While the show has it's problems, it's not nearly the disaster critics made it out to be. Thirteen years after the huge success of the film, Ms. Andrews re-creates her role for the stage (how many other actresses can play the same role, convincingly, 13 years later.) While Michael Nouri, in my opinion, is no match for James Garner, Tony Roberts is a delightful Toddy and Rachael York makes Norma her own. Lesley Ann Warren was BRILLIANT in the film version, Ms. York is equally as stunning in this production and was ROBBED of not only a Tony nomination, but the award itself.A must-have for all Broadway collectors, the shows flaws (primarily the book) can be easily overlooked due to the fabulous performances, brilliant technical achievements (sets being the most obvious) and terrific production values.Get it now!"
5,Loved it,"Casting was perfect, adjustments made for the stage from the movie version worked beautifully. When I saw this on Broadway, Liza Minelli was subbing for Julie Andrews. I prefer this version."
5,I love the Tenchi Family,"My friend recommended me this serial last year. This serial is one of my favourrite anime in my life. Fortunately I was born in Japan. I've seen countless anime since I could remember. I love all of the Tenchi Family. Specially Tench's grandpa that have an important key. And we, Japanese love the Japonaiserie atmosphere that this serial has in."
2,"Mistaken Idenitity; not a movie, was Broadway show.",The seller was great about returning it and his communication was great; thanks for all. I should have read the ad better. I thought it was the movie and it was a recorded broadway show.
2,Not quite like being there,"After anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Broadway version of Victor/Victoria, my disappointment was the sound quality...or lack of it. The orchestra overpowered everyone, even Julie Andrews and diminished my emotional involvement in the music considerably. Just as it is difficult to translate dance to television and retain the essence of the joy of dance, so it is with Broadway. The two dimensions leave out so much.It was my pleasure to see the Broadway production right before Miss Andrews left it. It was a night of theater I cherish. I am grateful we have a record of it, even if flawed. In his defense, Tony Roberts acting was a greater joy live than with the camera close-ups of this production. Rachel York was likewise hilarious live.If the sound had been mixed more professionally, the camera angles would not have been as distracting."
3,Nowhere near as good as the movie,"Victor Victoria is my favorite movie, so when I saw there was a Broadway performance available, I jumped at the chance to see it. The performance was just okay. The songs did not even come close to measuring up to the quality of the songs in the actual movie. The Toddy character disappointed me the most; I can't see anyone other than Robert Preston acting that part. Overall, it wasn't bad...but don't waste your money. You'd be better served buying the actual movie."
2,Thought it was the movie!,"I just didn't pay close enough attention to what I bought. I thought I was purchasing the Blu-ray movie version of Victor Victoria not the Broadway play. With Julie Andrews on the cover, who would have thought? I can't even find a Blu-ray of the movie. Oh well, its ok, just not what I wanted."
4,Fun Blake Edwards comedy,I would give the broadway production five stars except for one thing - Robert Preston. Tony Roberts is good in the role but Robert Preston was unforgettable. This is definitely a fun watch!
5,"Suprisingly Good Stage Play, Not The Movie","I purchased this Blue Ray thinking I was getting the Movie. When I started it, I was suprised to see the stage play. Wonderful. This brought a whole new aspect to the story. My wife and I loved it. I will still buy the Movie as soon as I see a Blue Ray release. I missed James Garner and Robert Preston. But that will give me an excuse to watch both versions again."
5,Brad's review,"If you're a John Piper fan---I think you'll love & enjoy this book. this one isn't quite as ""technical"" as reading Piper. It's all about seeking pleasure & enjoyment in Christ. GREAT read."
4,"The product is Light Almond colored, not White.","This product seemed well made (did not install it), but the color is light almond and not white, as expected and indicated in the product title."
2,"Mildly interesting, mostly annoying and self-aggrandizing.","It's been about two years since I read this book, but its lingering effect is extreme irritation with the writer. Fritscher is clearly far more interested in himself than in Mapplethorpe, and boastfully uses the subject of his ""biography"" (term used charitably) as little more than a tool with which to broadcast his own (clearly exaggerated) influence on -- and involvement with -- the photographer. While I don't doubt that Fritscher played a small role in Mapplethorpe's life and art, I don't for a second believe that it was even a tiny fraction of what he'd like you to believe. Jack, you were one of a large pool of pornographers and one of an even more humongous population of RM's lovers. This bio reeks of little more than self-promotion and self-promoting fiction, and the fact that it was penned posthumously makes it even more disgusting and annoying."
3,Personal insight on Mapplethorpe's life,"Jack Fritscher writes this memoir on Mapplethorpe's life, Fritscher's own gay coming out and the crossing of paths with Mapplethorpe in a shortlived bi coastal love affair. There is an intersting description of life in New York in the 70s, 80s and 90s in the art scene, gay scene, AIDS, the controversial Mapplethorpian art and attacks to it. The life of a genius of our times is reviewed in a dynamic, personal tell of much in the style of Fritscher. It is an intersting insight on the artist, the man and the art scene of such time, both in photography, painting and literature."
3,Disappointing,"I found this book extremely disappointing and agree with other reviewers that the author seemed more interested in aggrandizing himself through association with Mapplethorpe. Fritscher also seems intent on producing this biography to prove that Mapplethorpe selected him, rather than Patricia Morrisroe, as biographer. The writing is annoying, frequently repetitive, and skips all over the place chronologically. The book comes across more as a collection of magazine/newspapers articles rather than a coherent whole."
2,not so good,the reader rabbit software will not run in three different computers. the other reader rabbit (learn and read) i bought works fine.and the curious george does not work... dinosaur adventure works fine.
1,won't work on our Lenovo pc,FOr some reason I can't get this to work. The operating system is probably the problem. SO it was a waste of money.
3,"Previous reviewer makes good comments, but...","this CD doesn't blow one away, but it is a nice effort. It doeshave a good mix of songs and styles, and keeps the beat moving ina straight forward, main stream jazz style. I picked it up for a songand play it as background music with my family in the evening.A nice CD, but nothing to write home about."
3,"Basically, you get what you pay for.","As an inexpensive stocking stuffer, this worked. It was interesting enough to be a good gift and does have some use, but more as a telescope than as a microscope and I don't see anyone actually carrying this around in their pocket. It's a toy, for children, and does the trick, but would not meet an adult's expectations."
1,cool but...,"it fell apart within minutes of getting out of package. The first time it wasn't a big deal, the second time EVERYTHING fell out of the tube. The end screwed off way too easily, needs to be glued in not screwed into barely 3 threads. There were 4 different lenses separated by plastic tubes for spacing. If these aren't in correctly, it doesn't work. Unfortunately I'm not an optician by any means, so my son used it for about 10 min successfully. Luckily it was Xmas and he just moved on to the next thing. Potentially very cool cause it worked nicely... till it fell apart."
1,Totally useless,I bought this for a gift for my grandson. I opened it up and tried it before giving it to him. Even though it was very blurry when I looked thru it I hoped it would work for his young eyes. It's a fun idea but doesn't work. He likes to carry it around in his pocket so I guess it's durable. He keeps it in hopes of finding a bug to look at.
4,Works surprisingly well,"One of my kids requested this as a part of his ""spy kit"". It works surprisingly well for an inexpensive little gadget. He has spent quite a bit of time spying birds and other critters in the neighborhood."
1,Junk,Don't waste your $. Can't really see much out of it and takes a heck of a lot of time to try and focus the thing to see just a little bit. you can get much better out there for just as much $. Overall disappointed and wouldn't buy again.
3,Telescope,"neat toy, do I really need it???--It works---I like toys/gadgets ...eight more word needed to complete this one JT"
4,Good scope,"Nice pocket sized scope. Kids use it when they are playing spies. It does has a tendency to come unscrewed, so this may be a better toy for older children that can keep it together (more gently play too)."
5,faster/better than hamilton beach snowman,"I got the Hamilton Beach snowman ice shaver last week ordered from this site and it was satisfactory. My friend had enjoyed the shaved ice, so 2 days ago I went to Target and bought the Rival Snow Cone maker (for $19.99) because I needed a birthday gift for her that day. IT WAS SOOO MUCH FASTER!!!!!! This is the one to get. Makes me want to return the Hamilton beach model, but i threw out the box."
1,spend $8.00 more,"The machine worked very good the first three times, then the cheap plastic lid broke off.I returned the machine to Walmart and exchanged it for the next best model for only $8.00 more, much better machine. It's a Rival Deluxe."
4,just as represented,This 9X13 baking dish with lid and carrier is just as represented. It did not have the heat pack with it but you can buy those separately.
4,good product,"the only reason I gave it four stars is because I think it was a little bit expensive, but I guess u pay for the name or quality. it is a good quality product with really thick, rigid, and sculpted glass with a nice cover that fits perfect. the carrying bag is not the best of quality, but makes you look like a professional chief and gets the job done. the carrying bag really comes in handy when transporting food and keeps the food warm for hours."
4,Casserole is good to go,A fair price for a quality item. One shortage is the lack of a hot/cold gel pack. The gel pack recommended by Amazon was really too small.
3,Ok filter but there is a better one.,"This filter is a good product, but if you want the best filter on the market buy the Purolator PureOne filter. I did some research and it is much better than anything else. Same numbers, except that they begin with PL instead of L.Also, I discovered by accident that the L25230 is identical to this one except that it is about 1.5 inches longer, which means it has almost 40% more filter area! I installed one in my 2000 Saturn SL and it fits perfectly. Make sure you have enough clearance before you switch. FYI."
4,Works for me,"I used it to carry my Nikon D200 with lens as well as a small fill-in flash, some cords, a few flash cards, extra battery, and misc. It's relatively inconspicuous. I turn its Logo inward to make it less identifyable now that Crumpler has become more familiar."
4,Lots of fun.,"I have 9 of these,little guys,two cats and the rest of them are dogs.They are not very durable,but seem to be able to fall on the ground(From about three feet)And still work the same.They make real-a-listic sounds,and are very fun.I rated educational value as 3,as they are just toys.I hope you buy it!-Note-Please rate this if it was helpfull or not!-"
3,Fur Real Baby Lion Cub,"My 11yo dd enjoyed this toy initially, but it quickly became just another cute ""stuffed animal"" on the pile. She does play with it and definitely enjoys it at those times, but it's not among her very favorite of toys. I think it might appeal more to a child of perhaps 5 or 6 years old. It IS quite durable as toys go."
3,Look But Don't Touch,"My daughter has been through 2 of these. She loves them, even though they are hard as a rock on the inside. Unfortunately, it seems as soon as they are played with they completely flake out. She was not overly rough with the first one, but we definitely made sure she was careful with the 2nd and it only lasted a few days. The sounds will sort of come out, but the movements completely quit. I can't believe they actually tested them out on real children. We have had Lucky the Wonder Dog Robot by Zizzle for around 3 years and he is still going strong. The FurReal Pets also go through batteries very quickly. I wish they were cute and durable too, or that there was some kind of repair part or service plan ;)"
3,"Van, you have my attention..","No matter what, I love this man's voice: his inflections and growls, the Irish accent coming through now and again, the asides (take it! aw right!), his approach to the music, thoughtful, joyful, soulful, always interesting, even on a CD that doesn't exactly grab me the first time I hear it, (and with so much Dylanesque) is still alluring compared to the over produced junk that's out there for the most part, that I know I will be listening to this one regularly, as I mine it's meanings and enjoy it's variety of styles. Especially like his version of Georgia, Fast Train, and Steal my Heart Away. Van, you have my attention, once again."
3,"An Ace Soul Singer, Okay Songs","On his 900th release (just a guess), Van Morrison makes the best Blues Brothers album since John Belushi died. That's not quite fair to Van the Man - his blues roots run faster and deeper than the acting duo, but the pleasures of Down the Road are just as superficial. No doubt, Morrison is an ace soul singer. His viscous melismas, like a howl through molasses, are a trademark (sometimes an affectation), and though these songs are engaging, they're also slight. He's coasting - sometimes elegantly, sometimes showily, sometimes just barely at all. Exceptions: the elegant, showy ""Evening Shadows"", and his version of ""Georgia On My Mind"" [...]."
2,Phoned In,"Unfortunately a very mediocre effort from Van. Much of this disc sounds like filler, and indeed some tracks date back years, having been left off earlier albums. When compared to recent masterworks like ""Hymns To The Silence"", and ""Too long In Exile"" and even ""Back On Top"", (while not a classic), they are all much better than this offering. Truly sounds like Van is bored and phoned it in. I'm sure the next disc he makes will be miles ahead of this contract filler."
1,Not impressed,The repetitiveness of this cd kills me. All of the songs have a few lines that are repeated over and over and over. 2 min into the song you have the line memorized and are ready for the next song. Unfortunately there is another 2-3 minutes of song left to suffer through. Hey Mr. DJ is alright and Georgia isn't bad but the rest are just repetitive.
4,"Now, For Something Laid Back","I get a sense of Van being very laid back recording this album. I enjoy playing the CD as I'm working on one of my many projects; furniture building, HO train building, painting.I have some favorite songs on the CD like Down The Road, Meet Me In The Indian Summer, Choppin' Wood, Georgia On My Mind. This CD really mellows me out.What the heck, I might even sit down and write a letter to ""The Lovely former Mrs. McCarton"" and tell her that I was thinking of her.Buy this CD. You'll not be sorry."
4,Van Still the Man,"Down the Road is totally enjoyable and satisfying. Although Morrison does not pave any new roads his revisitation of the old familiar byways is abslutely flawless. Amazingly, his voice seems stronger than ever and the back up musicians are outstanding. To think that all but one of the songs are original Morrison compositions makes you wonder how in the world he continues to create so many modern musical masterpieces. I just wish he would tour America. The man is a genius and he cannot keep on keeping on forever."
5,"""Lonesome homesick Jones""","Further on down the road with Van Morrison we find familiar territory, but it's all of it good. He tells us in ""Whatever Happened to PJ Proby"" that, ""My Memory's getting so dim,"" but he sure hasn't forgotten what makes a great song or album.From his country bluesy harp on ""Down the Road"" to his astral harp on ""The Beauty of Days Gone By"" he touches base with styles he's visited before but gives us fresh takes on them here.A trip down the road with Van Morrison is logging miles well spent."
4,Another good album from one of the best artists out there,"""Down the Road"" will not go down as one of Van Morrison's all time classics like ""Moondance,"" or ""Into the Music,"" but it is a worthy addition to his remarkable discography. Personally I prefer it to ""Tupelo Honey,"" which it reminded me of. Most of the tracks have a warm, nastolgic feeling to them and there are a few romantic ballads that are quite beautiful. The album is very pleasant background music. A few of the standout tracks are ""down the road,"" ""steal my heart away,"" ""hey mr. dj,"" ""choppin wood,"" ""what makes the irish heart beat,"" and ""whatever happened to pj proby."" I think ""the beauty of days gone by,"" ought to have closed the album instead of ""fast train,"" just because ""beauty"" seems to sort of sum up some of the feeling on the album."
4,A great homage to his wonderful parents,"Van's parents used to own a small record shop in Fairfax, California called Caledonia Records. I first went there in the mid 70's and would spend all day looking through stacks and at all the wonderful things on the wall. Van's dad, George would often steer me away from some horrid piece of pop trash and direct me to some unheard gem. I had to be the only 11 year old listening to Rhythm and Blues. Later I was playing bass in a country band and his mom, Violet would come up and sing Mexicali Rose with us. Nice folks."
2,"Granted, I'm overly critical","While I enjoy Van's up-front horn based blues arrangements (better than most of what's out there) it's his Celtic, folky, rocky, troubador, soul-searching work that I've always loved the most. This CD let me down a little in that respect; granted there are some good things here. (I'll probably ""burn"" the non-horn offerings onto some ""best of the last 10 years"" Van CD). I still think he's got a few Poetic Champions...left in him as I continue to enjoy growing old with this unique artist and his music."
4,This book really helped for the loss of my pet friend.,"On Nov 2nd my husband and I put our 15 year old dog, Beaner, to sleep. Beaner was my first dog. I had a tremendous flood of emotions following his passing, and I scoured Amazon looking for a book to help understand/relieve some of what I was feeling.This book was truly wonderful. I specifically remember two things that helped me a great deal. One was sitting down and writing out my memories of Beaner. While it was sad to do this - I remembered so many good things (and humorous) that this was actually quite healing.The second thing was that it helps to have some sort of simple ceremony so that you can feel the release and/or closure of your time with your friend.My husband, who isn't a huge reader - also picked up this book to find some help. He also found it to be extremely helpful, and was moved to tears with the story of the Rainbow Bridge.I definitly recommend this book to anyone that has experienced a recent loss of their pet friend."
1,Too cold and unfeeling,"Being in the mist of animal grief right now I just recently got this book. One of the things the author says is why one is grieving is to not look at the animal's toys or photos until later. Well the first thing I wnat to do is to have their photo out. She seems to contradict herself when she says there is no right or wrong way to heal then she says don't do this or that. I found the book trite, unfeeling ,and cold. I am sorry I bought it. I will return it and get ""The Loss of A Pet"" instead."
5,A Wonderful Book for Pet Bereavement,"I got this book soon after I lost my 10-year-old Persian male soul mate, and it really helped me through a time of great sorrow. There are exercises to do that help you work through your grief and help you to understand your feelings. I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with the loss of a pet."
3,Good Before a Death of You Pet,I read the book but it didn't help me with the grieving of my pet. It is a good book to read if you aren't in the midst of recovery. There are good points as far as the ceremony but other than that it was nothing that I didn't already know.
5,Treatment Above-Board,"I've had lupus for 10 years and have read everything I could get my hands on. This is positively the most helpful book I've read. What is so surprising is that the UVA1 light treatment has also been around for 10 years. Like I just read in another review, I guess I'm lucky that a investigative journalist got sick. This is one lupus book I'm sure the money-grubbing drug company cartel didn't want written. Thank you!"
2,Limited Functionality,"This module does perform as advertised, however I have a huge complaint in the fact that there is no way to manually switch it to the warm mode once you feel that your food is done. This would be very handy at times."
2,There are only 4 programming options!,"I thought this was the answer to my crock-pot prayers! I received it for Christmas and was heart broken to realize that you can choose high for 4 or 6 hours or low for 8 or 10 hours. (Look at the product image enlarged) Most things I cook take 6 hours on low! I occasionally have something that needs 8 hours but most of the time it is 6 to 7 hours. Unfortunately, if it doesn't do the time you need, it is completely useless. You would have to be home to turn it off or down. So I returned it and am making do with my Select Brands corningware programmable, (it doesn't do 6 hours on low either) and a regular 3 quart. I just make it home in time or I don't cook it!"
5,The master of fantasy art!,"Icon is a perfect title for Frank Frazetta's new book. His work lays the fundamental basis for all other fantasy artists to follow. He is the most copied and respected artist in his field. He is an icon! This book features some of his best works. Simply ""Wow""! A must own for the fantasy art enthusiast."
3,"Great Content, Bad Manufacturing","For the content, I would definately give this book 5 stars. Unfortunatley, as soon as I opened up the book to look at it, the back binding came completely apart. I'm not going to go to the trouble of mailing it back to Amazon (and paying for the postage) so I glued it back myself. What a pain. It seems alright now, but it was a big hassle. The manuafacturers should go to more trouble to insure that their selling a quality product. This IS a coffee table book after all, which means that it is bound to see a lot a wear and tear over the years."
2,not fantastic!,"It's just a bunch of topless women. some of it is okay, I guess. It's not worth the money though!"
5,One the Best Fantasy Art Books Ever,An excellent companion to the book Legacy it provides the reader with an exciting array of some of Frazetta's best works (along with some interesting background to these paintings). Presented herein is a mixture of adventure and the erotic unmatched by any. If ever there were a Five Star book this is it.
5,A GEMSTONE FOR THE SOUL,"DJ DEAN HAVE INTRODUCES WHAT NOT MANY CAN DO BRINGING OUR MIND BODY AND SOUL INTO ONE MAGICAL AND ENERGETIC PLACE HERE ON EARTH. THE FIRST CD BRINGS MAGIC TO ANY ENVIROMENT FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. THE SECOND CD HAVE A FEW SONGS(1,7,8,14,16) BUT THEY ARE MORE ENERGETIC INDEED.REMEMBER ONLY IF YOU LISTEN TO THE DETAIL OF EVERY SONG YOU WILL FEEL THE MAGIC."
4,"""Down With Ignorance!""","So good! I read this immediately after ""The Shadow Speaker"" (yes, I went slightly out of order), so the pace seemed much slower at first and much of the stuff about Ginen had already been mentioned in the other book.Pretty quickly, though, I found myself getting hooked. About halfway through and until the very end, I tried to pace myself and only read a chapter or two at a time, so it wouldn't end as quickly.Since I've now finished this book, ""The Shadow Speaker"", and ""Who Fears Death?"", next up is ""Akata Witch"" and I'll be done! :)Nnedi needs to hurry up and write some more books for me to read"
4,Coming of age,"This is a coming of age story, of young Zahrah is a fantastical and well detailed world created by the author, Nnedi Okoroafor. I enjoyed following her adventures into the greeny jungle, and finding the egg of the creature needed to help revive her friend. I've since become a fan of this author.Myne WhitmanA Heart to Mend"
2,"It's OK, but.....","The problem is they put in a lot of footage that is NOT of the Third Reich; such as, of Japan, England, America, etc. etc....It was sort of like they did not have enough real footage, so they threw in a lot of off-topic stuff as filler.Its OK, but not truely what it pretends to be. As for the on-topic footage it has, it was great."
4,"Worth the money, good addition to any collection.","The color film from the 1930's is of surprisingly good quality and the segments showing life in Germany at this time are quite interesting. An added bonus in the Special Features is a short promotional for Berlin from 1936 - in preparation for the summer Olympics held there that year. Beautiful. War related footage is good and most I had not seen before in 20+ years of collecting color video from WWII. The minus, in my opinion, is the mournful, tragic tone of the British narration and funereal-sounding background music which cycles maddeningly over and over. Subtly insulting to anyone who is knowledgeable about this period in history."
1,very poor quality for a very big Price,"After spending over thirty dollars plus shipping on this product, I found it be a major dissappointment. Although there was some footage that I'd never seen before, most of the film was the same old stuff I'd seen on a dozen other videos including, ""The Whole Story"", ""Eva Braun's Home Movies"" and ""Good Morning Mr.Hitler"". The poor quality of the video and the cracklin in the audio track ranged from fair to very poor. Not recommended!"
2,"Poor quality, high price","In addition to the poor quality of the film, I was disappointed to find that most of the footage in this video was was taken from various other products on the subject of the Third Reich including ""Eva Braun's home movies"" and ""Good morning Mr.Hitler"".Much to [costly] for the poor quality.Not recommended."
1,Seora Dead Sea Body Mud,I'm afraid that this product was so incredibly messy that it did not prove practical to use. It left a muddy residue in the bathroom and was not possible to use on the hands under gloves to treat the skin overnight because of the risk of ruining both the gloves and the the sheets.I feel this product is better suited for use in a spa or clinic than for general home use.
3,A Handy Reference tool.....however....,"I work in the non-profit world, helping disadvantaged children get access to music and music education...so I need a lot of reference materials. At first glance, this Encyclopedia looked terrific - easy to use, lots of information...but my heart plummeted when I read the paragraph about ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"", Ella Fitzgerald's first big hit. Mr. Hischak states that Ella was only 15 years old at that time - and yet, he states it was 1938...AND ELLA WAS BORN IN 1917!!!Come on - this is a major goof.Now I'm wondering how many more errors there may be.AUGH!"
4,SPACE AGE ELECTRO POP,"Another winner of a compilation from Todd at A Different Drum. I have never failed to find new music to get into with one of ADD's compilation and this one is no exception.All tracks are keepers but I am most partial to the Neuropa, B! Machine, Moulin Noir and Blue October tracks. Good for dancing, driving, hanging out or riding on the train.Buy it and it will enhance your life."
2,Not Really what I expected,"In my opinion, this album is more dance than new wave, and is notreally what I expected from the description.I enjoy songs where a catchy beat, and creative synth work enhancegood vocals and meaningful lyrics.The tracks on this cd are exactly the opposite. In most cases an overabundance of great synth work is being wasted on lame lyrics and average vocals.If you are interested in hearing a demo of every possible sound thatyou can get out of a synthesizer, and are more into night club dance music, then you might really enjoy this collection."
1,music to sleep by,"if slumber is what you crave, then grab this album with your shakingly sleep deprived mitts and take a much needed trip to the domain of morpheus. it works so well that i almost passed out driving on the NJTP in the middle of the afternoon.i found it stale an unimaginative.i really love the synthpop sound from depechemode to kraftwerk. after hearing this collection, i thought that maybe the sound was dead and that i was just trying to relive an age past.then i discovered FREEZEPOP and BIS. buy those and know that synthpop lives on with as much or more life than ever."
4,NEW BLOOD OF ELECTRO : KEEP IT UP!!,"NEW BORN OF ELECTRO GROUP LIKE FATHER KRAFTWER,DEPECHE MODE,ERASURE AND LIAISONS DANGEREUSES,CAMOUFLAGE..DEVISION..FRONT 242..INFORMATION SOCIETY..DFA..C.C.C.P>>>>>>>UNITED STATE OF EUROPE..ANYTHING BOX.."
1,Out of date,"I have 2 major problems. First is that the book is based on a version several years old, and not relevant to the new program I was ordering. The second problem is that I immediately asked for a refund, got the OK but have not received my credit after about 4 weeks. NOT like Amazon at all."
2,Waste of money,"This past summer, I had two operations on my hands, and, in order to continue working, I purchased Dragon Naturally Speaking v10 and the ""Dummies"" book.Both were disappointing.The best of the ""Dummies"" books have been those where you could follow along, step by step, with whatever it was that you were trying to master. Because this book was written when Dragon v4 was out, many of the commands, screens and processes outlined in the book no longer relate. Additionally, they make reference to Microsoft Office programs which have also been updated since the book was written, and therefore those procedures are out of date as well.There is definitely a need for an updated ""Dragon for Dummies"" book, and I hope that the publisher is working on it. As it stands now, don't waste your money or time on this one."
1,This book is so out of date it should be withdrawn,"With the current version of DNS being version 11, it is foolish for anyone to buy (and the publisher to promote...) a book that is aimed at a version that PREDATES version #4. Avoid at all costs since to refer to this book will cause trouble."
5,4.0,"This was the only book I found. I't's for Dragon Naturally Speaking 4.0. Mine is the latest, 12.0. So far it has been working for me, but I'll continue looking to see when they'll put out a book for 12.0."
1,Outdated,This product i thought would be quite useful to go along with dragon naturally speaking 11 but as it turns out it was only for the 4th edition. There needs to be a new one made. Guide was somewhat effective but severely outdated.
1,Book Outdated Worthless,"Dummies Books are usually helpfull and entertaining, however Dragon Naturall Speaking for Dummies is worthless as it was created for version 4 of the product in 1999, the current version is 11 and far advanced from version 4.Don't waste your money on this. It would be really nice if they would create an updated version."
5,Book Purchase,This was a great purchase! It was exactly what I was looking for and was just what was described. It was shipped and I received it very quickly!
2,Dragon Has No Fire,This book is fine but Dragon is not a good product. DRAGON's PRODUCT is USELESS - it did not work after several tries and was a complete failure. I ended up buying IBM's product and had wonderful customer service and the product is very user friendly!
1,Perfectly Useless,This book is seven years old. It was written for version 4.0. We are now up to 9.0.Avoid it.
1,"Out dated, Version 4",If you have purchased Dragon 10 this book is of little or no help. It was written for Version 4.
1,Outdated,Great book if you have the very old version 4. Dragon naturally Speaking is up to version 9.5 and has changed drastically since this book was printed.
2,This book is out of date,"This book used to be useful but is now eight years out of date.To learn how to use the latest version of Dragon, check out the Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 ""Video Guide"" and ""QuickStart."" They are CD-ROMs that play on your computer. I am the author of both of these titles. They are available on Amazon:Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 Preferred QuickStartDragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Video Guide: Complete Three-Volume Set"
2,Very Disappointing,"I received this book as a gift for my birthday because I was also given Dragon NaturallySpeaking version 10, it was very disappointing to discover that the book was intended for version 4 and that its copyright is 1999, 10 years ago. So I had to return this book which both disappointed myself and my bride, who gave it to me, along with the software package. In my opinion or clearly show that this book is severely out of date for the current version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking.For what it's worth, I wrote this review with Dragon naturally speaking."
1,"Stink, Stank, STUNK!","ZERO Stars. After struggling with it for a few weeks, I just threw it away today. About half of the time, I would resort to my Leatherman to finish opening a can it had screwed up."
2,Barely usable,"Don't waste your money on this, like I did. It does not have releases after 1973 or so. Book was first published in 1981, so I was hoping it covers discography up to late 70s, but not so unfortunately. Fine with early discography, but not for money asked. You can find most of this info on-line, for free."
3,Nothing Spectacular.,"I purchased this during a promotion when it was 1/2 off the normal price. I was kind of disappointed. The cans are small - about the size of a normal condensed can of soup, only you don't add any water to this. So it only makes 1 1/3 bowls, or 1 large bowl of soup. By no means enough for 2 people.I'd stick with the stuff you get from the supermarket. This stuff was a little bit cheaper (only a little bit) when it was 1/2 off. There's no way I would have paid full price for this.The flavor was good, but not like WHOOPEE."
5,"Recap of career of baseball's ""Shining Knight""","Stan the Man Musial: Born to Be a Ballplayer is author Jerry Lansche's third baseball book and his first autobiography. It follows Musial's career, year-by-year, through its ups and downs (mostly ups) from the time he broke in with the St. Louis baseball Cardinals in September, 1941, through his retirement in 1963. Full of stories and anecdotes, Stan the Man Musial is the most complete biography ever written on baseball's ""Shining Knight."" Lansche's second book, Glory Fades Away: The Nineteenth Century World Series Rediscovered, is out of print, but can be located with some difficulty through mail-order catalogues. You may contact the author directly at jlansche@trucom.com for purchase of autographed or non-autographed copies"
4,A good parenting book,this is a good start for families and parents wishing to improve family dynamics. Good exercises to do with your family and good food for thought.
4,The New PeopleMaking,This book is very user friendly - uses plain language to talk about self worth and good ways to develop this in children and self. Excellent book as a starter for people wanting to understand self worth better. Good exercises to do.
3,Good Ideas Hidden in Corny Language,"Many of satir's ideas about the family structure and how people work in general hit the nail right on the head but the way she presents them just make me laugh because they are so corny. Her language is quite relaxed which gives the book a very comfortable feeling, but sometimes it's so outdated it's hard to take seriously. A lot of her ideas about the different types of people and how we react to one another within the family are really helpful. She talks about common problems in troubled homes that one might not think of, and when you read the book you go ""oo yea, that's why that happened!"" But, all the little experiments and little pictures that are in the book are so laughable that it's hard to take her seriously. If you get passed that though the book achieved it's goal of being a book about how to improve your family if your willing to let you self feel a little silly it can really be a helpful tool to help the family grow together."
2,Boring.,"Super boring book. I didn't read it all, though, just the parts that were necessary for the class I was taking. I am glad it was inexpensive."
2,Annoying,"Okay I listened to the rave review that ""The New Peoplemaking"" got here on Amazon so I bought the book. Before I say anything bad about the book I thought that the parts dealing with past-present transference (feelings about someone you knew in the past were good (transfering that to the present with someone you think is similar) Also I thought the section on negative communication styles was very good (the author could have gone into more depth with each style instead of making them into sweeping generalizations).However, I couldn't finish this book the exercises were way too ridiculous and moreover part about viewing the world from the eyes of a baby quite frankly made me want to gag it was so long and irrelevant. After getting past page 238 I literally could not stand reading another page."
2,OK at best,"I'm not a fan of existential therapy. Satir's theme throughout this book is positioning your bodies to match a particular attitude, e.g. ""placating"" would look like begging on your knees. There are too many activities to do with your family that I find pretty ridiculous, including tying each other with rope to signify something or another. By the middle chapters, reading this book was a chore (I had to continue because it was assigned reading). I would not read this book again."
1,O.R.B.I.T.,ORBIT stans for OVER RATED BETER INSTALL TOROI work on this system EVERY spring at a great cost and haveing a hard time to get parts WTF
1,Horrible item!,"I bought mine at Lowes. My solenoids would go bad all the time, I RMA'd them so much that the factory stopped responding to my emails. THe unit that I purchased also had a known problem with the diaphragms so I would have to get replacements every summer to fix the known issue. Eventually my warranty was dead and I just went out to fire it up again and all the joints leak, the diaphragms leak, another bad solenoid. I think Rain bird for replacements? and I am going to glue together my own manifold. Dont buy this because you think its easier. I did and I want to punch myself in the face. Good luck with any other item, you cant go wrong unless you buy this one.AS for as the buyers listing it, I dont have anything against them, jut the item."
1,Poor Leaky Quality,"Poor quality of the product. Leaks on both sides regardless of tape, puddy, etc. I will never purchase another Orbit product."
4,Clarks England Sterling - Honey Color,"These are the most comfortable shoes on the planet. Sexy look with slacks or a long skirt. However, with age the shoes sweak while walking in quite halls. I still love them and intend on ordering another color because of the comfort factor. Great job Clarks!"
4,Works .... But ...,"This product works ... but out of the box it did not. Through a process of elimination, and after buying another battery and a push button end cap, I discovered that there could be a design/manufacturing flaw on how the electric circuit is completed. Solved the problem. The item works as intended. However, I am now concerned about the durability under use."
1,An excellent reference ...,"In spite of all that has happened in the ""dot com"" world, this book showcases some of the companies, many lesser-known, who are still prospering from the Internet. I enjoyed every chapter as it unfolded, in usually less than four pages, how a particular Internet-based company was formed. An interesting read and I have recommended it to many people."
3,Only for hardcore WWII fans..,"This is a long movie that has some slow parts.. especially the beginning. I found some of the combat scenes to be unbelievable. For example, Russian tanks would retreat when the Finnish soldiers attacked without tank support. I'm not a military history expert but I thought that was unrealistic."
5,Excellent War Movie,"This was one of the best war movies I ever saw. The action was great and I did not even mind the sub-titles. The weapons and equipment were real, I especially got a joy at seeing the Tokarev SVT's. Highly recommended."
1,"Very interesting pic, abysmal DVD from Belle and Blade","To make it short: The picture is very interesting, a must see for every war movie fan. Especially the fighting on the huge-scale sets including vintage russian armour (even a flamethrower tank is roaming the battlefield!) is VERY impressive.However, the DVD edition from a company or label ""Belle and Blade"" is one of the worst I have ever seen. The picture quality is sub-VHS Standard, the sound in a flat stereo, the english subtitles are totally oversized and not removable, there are no extras at all - in one word, you'll get pure... for your hard-earned Euros (or Dollars). What a pity, the picture has deserved a decent relaese.So, for the movie itself, I would say 4 out of 5 stars, for the DVD: None at all and a beating for the guys who are responsible for this mess..."
4,The Tele Master,"If you want to see Danny Gatton play, this is a great video. Seeing his fingers fly accross the frets is amazing.If you want to see him slow down and teach, well good luck. A great video to have as a keepsake. Too bad he ended it all."
1,Amazing but lacking,"There's no question that Danny Gatton is one of the greatest guitarists that has ever graced the planet, but it's pretty tough to follow what's going on if you're trying to learn how he does it. It's a whole lot of playing, which of course is mind boggling and wonderful. But when there is instruction, there's not enough explanation to exactly what's going on and then he just starts playing again -- really fast. Even the slowed down examples are hard to follow as the camera angles miss what he's doing in the left hand. I bought a Redd Volkaert DVD called Stolen Licks and it was about 10-15 ""riffs"" that he clearly explains, not to mention how clear the video is.I'm sure I'll learn a couple of things from the Gatton video, but, really, shame on Arlen Roth for not making sure it was much clearer."
2,mediocre product,"Danny Gatton is an amazing guitar player, but this dvd is not that great. Its cool to see him up close doing his thing, but the tablature print in the accompanying booklet is microscopic and there aren't too many examples of his famous techniques. He spends more time on his jazzier side than he should, and gives too little focus to his use of double stops and barely speaks of his chicken' picken' and use of his fingers, perhaps his best technique. The ability to watch the examples in real time and in slo-motion is nice, but unless you are a big fan (and even then) this is not the best product to get to play like Gatton."
5,"Eclectic, original and powerful","Fiona Renshaw is one of the least well known, yet most talented musicians and singers in the world today. Steadily extremely well received and reviewed, her output and sales have never lived up to her talent. Her distinctive and emotional voice is well suited to her material. She clearly has a love for her work, and deserves more recognition. This CD should have become a major seller and led to many more. But her output seems to be careful and deliberate, so her follow-up was only an EP and took quite a while to arrive."
4,A straightforward and complete overview,This book is nicely written and gives a good introduction to topics of risk management. The exercices at the end of each chapter are such that you actually understand the subtility behind some of the concepts introduced.
4,Easy to use.,"Is easier to sit at table and use, since I have trouble standing for long periods of time. Makes life easier for me to sit and cook."
1,Big disappointment!,I received this as a Christmas gift and was very excited. What a huge disappointment! I've used this at least eight times and every time my food sticks to the bottom. I've tried every trick I know to stop the food from sticking - nothing works. After trying to make hash browns in it last night for supper and once again winding up with half the hash browns stuck to the pan - I am throwing this away. I'd give it NO stars if I could!
2,Uneven cooking,"The heat on this skillet is fairly even for the 3/4 of the surface closest to the heating element, but significantly lower at the far end. I suspect this is because of the small size oif the heating element and/or because it attaches to the middle of the short end rather than the long end (where it would be closer to the most distant sections). This is unfortunate, since it otherwise seems to be a well-made, heavy-duty product at a good price."
3,Would not buy again because the legs broke off,"Two legs broke off when placing it on the counter after washing. I'd like to have another, but won't chance it again.Dee"
3,Did the job,"I only purchased this for the HcG diet, I got the whole case of twelve boxes and used only two. It did the job as in I used it to snack on, but it tasted like I was eating a crunchy cardboard box. I guess I can feed the rest to the ducks."
3,Appeared to have many scans of images - low quality,"Appeared to have many scans of images - low quality. Wasn't as good as expected, especially consider who the author was."
4,Cute Suncatcher,"This prism does a good job of reflecting rainbows all through the room.I was going to order more, but she has gone WAY UP on price!I originally got my suncatcher crystal for about 7 dollars. That was only inFebruary, 2010! Now, her prices are quite out of my range."
1,"not just kinda bad, really-really ugly","Oh no David Carson- its really over. The end has come- well, not of print... Leave McLuhan alone. This book is terrible, really terrible. The design is a mess. Reading McLuhan should never be a chore. This one should go straight to the landfill-- Has anyone else seen it? Don't you agree?"
2,Flimsy for the Price,The base of this juicer is flimsy. When you press down on the handle the base flexes and the head backs away from the fruit resulting in minimal juice extracted. There are better products out there for cheaper.
5,Best aviation book I've ever read! Very entertaining.,"A great book. Charles Collar sure can tell stories well. Hard to explain the book with just a few words. The beginning has a lot of fun stories and I really liked the Bahamas stuff. Towards the end is more accident investigation stuff, which I doubted I'd like, but I did. Also kind of scary to find out how our government works. Very educational."
3,Exausting,"The story is too long and boring, because everything is repeated and repeated again. The British arrogance shines through, especially to the ""unskilled"" islanders, their eating and living habbits. But it's remarkable, what she explored at that time as a lonely woman on an unexplored island like Hawaii."
3,Remembering Hawaii,"After hiking in Kauai I just wanted to slip into a book to relive the colors and smell of the landscape. This book did it for me. She takes you back to the island, introduces you to some of her native friends, and reveals some local knowlege. I loved her descriptions of the landscape. I hope to get back to Hawaii sooner than later. Mahalo!"
1,Leaky coffee maker,"This coffee maker looks good in the picture and sitting on the counter - until you try to use it. Within five minutes of putting water in the maker, the coffee maker was sitting in a pool of water, leaking from the bottom - not a great way to start the morning."
3,Mildly Amusing & Entertaining,"I wasn't sure what I was getting after I ordered this book. It's in hardback and cute but not applicable at all. You see, I dream of being an evil overlord like Ming the Merciless or Dr. Victor Von Doom. I thought I'd learn how to go about it but the book is all tongue-in-cheek. Sadly I'm not. 8^) While not a sociopath, I am a psychopath in that I aspire to be a ruthless dictator and hoped this book might give me some food for thought.The price is right for entertainment. Easy to read. H*ll I read it while riding on a business trip with some co-workers. They were sorely disappointed too as they all wanted to be my evil henchmen and kill me off once I had achieved the real power and success I dreamt of.It's entertaining, amusing, thoughtful and fun to read but nothing in here is usable. I'll just have to stick with the Art of War, The Art of Warfare, the Prince and 48 Laws of Power....for now."
5,Fearfully Funny,"I loved this book and its companion, ""The Villains Guide to Better Living."" The over all design, illustrations and color scheme brought me back to the mid 70's and the books I had in school (you remember the spelling books and science readers with their vivid reds, avocado greens and mustard yellows). The writing is deliberately deadpan and speaks to the tormented genius in all of us who is bored with a wold that just doesn't understand us and our potential for greatness. It's a lot of good silly dark humorous fun. When I read the book I kept hearing it narrated by the elegant voice of Vincent Price. It makes an excellent mini coffee table book to leave out for your friends to read when they come over for a dinner party. As they enjoy your superb taste in food and literature you can announce that you've poisoned their drinks and they only have moments left to live... Muahahahah!!!! Its so good to be bad."
4,Goofy and entertaining,"Practice your evil villain laugh (mwuh-ha-ha-ha!) and redecorate that dungeon! This handy dandy self-help book for the world-conquering super-villain or evil warlord to be perfect for reminding one of the joys inherent in a career of crime and villainy. Need advice on how to outfit your Legions of Doom? Don't think the name Lord Milquetoast quite cuts it? This little gem has all the advice you'll need before you set out to conquer the world (or province, or nation, or universe ... whatever).Goofy. Funny. Amusing illustrations.What more could one want?"
3,Comic fans may still like it--I like it---but I'd hoped for more.,"The book has a fun topic, & the illustrations are clever (very 50s-60s Modern in their style), though I felt that 3/4 through it started to drag a little.The sequel is actually better than this first volume.Alternatives well worth buying--Evil Inc Annual Report 2005Evil Inc Annual Report vol. 2Humor & villainy make a great combination."
3,Interesting....,"I bought this on a whim to make the $25 minimum for free shipping. It saved me nearly $10 and I figured it would be a funny, quick read. While it is funny; it's by no means quick and I definitely won't be a super-villian when I've finished. The humor is mild for an adult - though my H.S. class loved taking the Villian quiz at the beginning. All around, I wouldn't recommend it but if you come across a copy and are in need of some toilet reading material, crack the pages and see how you like it."
2,"OK, but could be better","The artist's conceptions of the text were fairly basic drawings that did little more than fill half of the short book - although the evil teddy bear was kind of likable.A quick way to ""kill"" an evening, but I'd rather just watch Goldmember again..."
4,A very brave and honest book,"Elaine Fowler Palencia is a fine fiction writer who has said that she had to find a new language to write about her handicapped son Andrew. That language was poetry. Palencia speaks it like a native, and she pulls no punches in telling the truth of what it's like to watch you child's body outgrow his mind. A sad experience, sometimes ugly, sometimes terrifying, but with moments of odd and poignant beauty."
4,fryer filter,"Replacement charcoal filters are difficult to find for some reason. These work fine. If/when you find what you want, buy a bunch of them."
3,Need to be cut to size,"Difficult to get the size right when cutting to the size of your old filters. Unfortunately, there's no pre-cut option for my fryer; this is the only replacement option as far as I know.As you're cutting the filters to size, the black charcoal leaves dust all over your work surface. They do work better than a dirty filter or no filter when installed (though I really had to wedge them in there and do some more trimming around the edges). Still, these don't seem to fit or work as good as the original filters, but what are you going to do?"
3,Not so much,"I wasnt really happy with these, they didnt fit very well and I needed to cut them to fit. But the price was decent."
4,"It fits, and it works","These filters require that you cut a little bit off the edges to make them fit, but I don't find that to be too inconveniencing. They fulfill their purpose and keep dirt/debris/oil from getting into or out of the fryer. Haven't had any problems with them."
5,a beast,"I love these sub. If you want spl. These will do that. I have the 06 model. I would also recommended a ported enclosure. I have a hifonics brutus bxi 2008d wired @ 1 ohm. Thats 2000 watts rms @ 1 ohm. Also buy dynamat for your trunk. I crack my front glass. So you be careful when crank the bass level and the volume level. On another note, let subs break in b/c the spider is stiiff. Break-in will loosen the spider. That take 2 wks. You wont be disappointed."
5,Welcome contribution to contemporary Middle Eastern studies,"Associate professor of political science Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh presents In The Path Of Hizbullah, a thorough examination of the history and present-day situation of the Islamist group known as Hizbullah, or the Party of God. Consisting of mainly Lebanese Shiite Muslims, Hizbullah is well known for using both militant and moderate tactics to pursue its goals. Indeed its changing back and forth between extremes has puzzled those who would study it or those who are forced to confront it. In The Path Of Hizbullah details the crises that led to Hizbullah's emergence, its clerical leadership and hierarchical structure, and examines its shifts between militancy and gradualist pragmatism. Research, statistics, and tables flesh out the close scrutiny of Hizbullah's activities, in this unbiased examination of all that Hizbullah is and speculation upon what Hizbullah will become. A welcome contribution to contemporary Middle Eastern studies shelves."
3,Fun if incomplete,"They were just finding their center and then... the series was cancelled. Worth buying, but at a discount or used, I'd not pay more than $15 or so, unless you are a big B-5 fan. ( I am, and paid more)"
4,"Not bad, but not B5 either","I enjoyed this series, and like most B5 fans, I was sorry to see it end after 5+ (mostly) glorious years. Unfortunately, due to events with Warner Brothers, Babylon 5 was moved to TNT for the 5th year, and while we did get some cool movies out of the deal, TNT was in some respects trying to milk it for what it could get, and Crusade was the result. I have enjoyed Gary Cole in other roles immensely (Office Space, American Gothic, etc.), and as we've seen, he and others from this series have gone on to star in other shows (Lost, Beastmaster, etc.), but Crusade came out at a time when Hollywood was expecting much more immediate results, and as such it wasn't allowed to blossom into the series that spawned it. I would definitely recommend this to any true B5 fan, and if you enjoy Science Fiction this may be for you as well. If you're just looking to kill some time, you might look elsewhere for your enjoyment."
4,Wish they made more!,Nice series with great potential. Very well done. Not B-5 which I very much enjoyed as well. I wish they made several more seasons as it explored several interesting themes and the characters were developing quite nicely.
4,Good Science Fiction,"This series embodies intelligent creativity, in both acting and story line; I would recommend this series to anyone looking for thinking Science Fiction. I found it entertaining as well as thought provoking, as the series touched of on a variety of different social as well as philosophical subjects; this is basically some of the best science fiction available."
3,"Good show, but it's not widescreen, and not complete.","Unlike all of the Babylon 5 series, this DVD set is not widescreen - big disappointment. Obviously, it is also incomplete. The show is good, but not up to B5 quality. I think it was just cut-off before the characters had a chance to gain lasting appeal.Some cool technology is shown, especially the high-powered Excalibur ship. The techno-mage also has neat tricks, but there's just so much wasted potential."
2,Plots & Effects Like a 60's Star Trek episode but with much worse dialog!,I tried but couldn't make it through 3 episodes! The sets and plots reminded me of the original Star Trek series but but the dialog was much worse. Babylon 5 itself was a much better show. With shows like FarScape being produced around the same time frame - no wonder it got pulled!
2,No chemistry,"I loved Babylon 5 and was looking forward to the spin-off, but I didn't enjoy it.There were several minor problems. For example, the costumes were ugly and the captain's in particular looked poorly cut. The musical score was grating and way too distracting during the entire show, especially since it was too loud to tune out.But the real problem in my view was the total lack of chemistry among the crew, even after all 13 episodes, as opposed to the almost immediate amazing chemistry among the cast of other Sci-Fi series like Farscape or Firefly. I never cared enough about any of the ""Crusade"" members to root for them, maybe because they themselves never convinced me they actually cared about each other, be it as actors and/or characters.Storywise, the series had so much potential. It's a shame the characters' wooden interaction in particular ruined it for me."
2,Often too painful to watch,"As die-hard B5 fans, my wife and I were eager for a fix and decided to purchase the Crusade series on DVD. This was a mistake. Some of the episodes have acting and story lines that are so poor that they too painful to watch. I am not sure they could have found more second-rate actors and gathered them onto a single show. Our recommendation is to keep the wonderful B5 series in your memory and do not taint this memory the tripe named Crusade."
4,Another series killed too soon,"I eagerly awaited the series, and watched it even knowing that it had been cancelled before it even aired. The cast is great, the storyline is interesting and complex. Too bad they didn't get a chance to really tell the story. But if you loved Babylon 5 , then give this a try, just be aware that the story never got finished.I particularly liked the archeologist. He was arrogant and oblivious and thoroughly fun to watch.The techno mage was another interesting character, we didn't learn anywhere close to all his secrets I'm thinking.And it was fun to have a Captain who was a gambler and not so rule bound as many ship captains are portrayed to be especially if they are military.Can I mention again how dissapointed I am that I will not ever find out what the intended end of the story was?"
5,"a great Spinoff Of the greatest TV Show ""Babylon 5""","ok this is a no brainer if you saw BABYLON 5 SEASONS 1 THROUGH 5 then you MUST OWN THIS! you will get insight into the Drakkh the Vorlons, Bigtime Info on the Technomages! especally Galen the Technomage Joins Gideon's Crew here along with the first ever Military Telepath! and the new Uber Excallibur ship rocks more then even the whitestar's do and they make several camios in this along with babylon 5 cast and crew even the station itself! well worth owning if you are a babylon 5 fan otherwise this might not be for you since its a direct tie in not a stand alone.5 STAR ALL THE WAY AND LOADS OF EXTRAS."
4,Wish it was still on.,"What a great spin-off of Bab 5. To bad it did not make it on TV. This would be a great show for the SCI-FI network to produce, when the aging SG-1 guys leave us this year. If you have any of the Bab-5 DVD's, this is a must to complete your set."
4,Crusade,This series is a spin off of B5. Whom ever is a fan of B5 will enjoy this series spin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Almost very good...,"Aside from TNT's meddling, this series came off to a pretty good start, but it had it's own problems and cliches (a thief with cat-like eyes/agility anyone?) to overcome.Sound a bit like Babylon 5, doesn't it? Given another season or two (free from meddling), it probably would've become another semi-classic TV series that never got quite enough attention (just like Babylon 5). Certainly enough forward-looking plotlines were laid down, and by the end, looked to finally have found its stride. It's a shame that the series will never be finished. Hopefully, at some point, another B5 movie (better than Legend of the Rangers, hopefully) or book series finishing off this story will come out."
4,Crusade - The Complete Series,"This series probably deserved 5-stars. My rating of 4-stars is because I felt like I was left hanging. If you are a ""true"" sci-fi fan, you find yourself wanting the series to continue."
1,Crusade,"Crusade, the thematic is very poor...seems to be released for children...the actors are very bad but it is the Director's fault including story...I lost my money...I only saw two disc hoping better of this movie but it didn't happen..."
3,Aren't they supposed to go out and find a cure?,"here is one major reason this series failed: If they were supposed to be going out to unexplored space to find a cure for the plague, then why were they back at Earth every other episode. I think many viewers either started loosing interest or completely lost interest because the show was going no where. In 13 episodes they went to two or three new places, Babylon 5 and Earth like seven times. Hello, get on with the mission. I know there is a long term view but you have to grab viewers and keep them interested. The show simply 100% failed to do that. I am going to buy this DVD, but that is just my opinion on why it failed as a series."
5,Very Good,I felt that this would be a good add to my Babylon 5 collection I only wish that it would have continued on further.
4,Excellent addition to the Babylon 5 universe,"Crusade is a great addition to the Babylon 5 universe and its a shame that it never got a chance to continue. This dvd set does quite do the series justice. The episodes are out of order which makes things confusing for those not familiar with the series. The it a same that there is not more audio comentary with the actors because the one episode that has it, is great. If you can get this set at a good price its worth it."
3,"It had promise, but was sabotaged","This show was pretty weird when it was on, and I bought it for the sake of completeness. There's an actual explanation in the special features, where they filmed several episodes, then essentially refilmed them with a higher budget, but refused to throw out the old ones, leaving the show with costume changes and establishing simple things multiple times.It had a lot of promise, and I'm sorry the show didn't make it. Still, it's not necessary unless you already know you enjoy it."
3,JMS Having fun,"I'm a huge fan of J. Michael Straczynski, and I've been dying for some new, good sci-fi since BSG went off the air. Crusade was the last B5 product I hadn't gotten, and I'm glad I did. True- its not as compelling as some others (Like B5 or BSG), but it is some good stories, some good story telling, and some very good characterizations/acting. I like it a lot. What really stood out though, was how clearly the creators decided to ""have fun"" with it. Most likely, the word came down early the show wouldn't be renewed, so they did some fun creative things they might not have done; Whimsical story lines, a huge spoof of The X-Files, for example. Good TV for fans of JMS."
3,Short Crusade,"Since the season ended well before resolution, you just felt cheated out of the whole story. The promise was there but too many of the episodes failed to advance the plot or the characters. The graphics were fair to good, depending on the episode, but the forced relationship with B5 was streaching things and should have been more of a once off event rather than a constant tie in. What was really missing was a feeling the enemy was watching the Earther's efforts and trying to stop them. Only the last episode hinted at this and started to tie in the technomages."
4,Another good show cut before it could complete,I really like this show it is unfortunate it dead ended before it could complete its story line it would have been nice if they could have closed the story line out or done a move to close it like they did with firefly.
5,CRUSADE,This is a great series. They should have kept it going. Great characters and story. They used more of a type of virtual reality effects which some do not like. I happen to love science fiction and enjoy all types of visual effects.
2,I wish I could erase Crusade from my brain!,"That seems harsh, but although I liked Babylon 5, the series started to go downhill in Series 5, which was a bit incoherent and felt slapped together. I understand the underlying reasons for this.But Crusade is much worse, in my opinion. It is as bad as Andromeda, except Andromeda was allowed to linger on for years.I consider myself a Bablyon 5, but if you are honest enough with yourself to admit the decline in quality starting in series 5, then Crusade will just make you irritated and annoyed.Go buy The Lost Tales, those are actually nice sci fi stories with good acting and special effects - as well as familiar characters."
3,A sorry sequel.,"I loved Babylon 5. I was hoping Crusade would be of the same caliber. I'm sorry it wasn't. Right out of the gate, it was hampered by its very concept...a five-year mission. Where have I heard that before? They were racing from one part of the galaxy to another in a race to find the means to save Earth. That automatically meant that for all five years, except the last 3 or 4 episodes, they would fail. While some episodes were interesting, you knew each week, they would come up empty.Now, let's talk about the music score. I have never had to endure such a barrage of atonal plonking in my entire life.I won't talk about the acting. Almost every new show has a period where the actors have not quite gotten into their characters, and Crusade was no exception.I think JMS laid an egg with Crusade.Still, if you can find it cheap, there are enough episodes that are decent, to nake it worthwhile for a B5 fanatic."
3,not as good as B5,I enjoyed watching Crusade but after having just finished watching 5 years of B5 it was a let down.
1,Crusade ? (yawn),"I purchased this series based on the reviews I read. Now I think whoever wrote them had to be thinking about something completely different. This had to be the worst science-fiction series I have ever seen. The writing was sloppy, story lines confusing and special effects and props/ models very amateurish. The first few episodes were very difficult to get through. They made almost no sense at all. Subsequent episodes smoothed out and started to show some improvement as the characters developed a little, but overall I found it to be a complete waste of time and money. Sad too, as I have seen the actors in other roles and they were all quite talented and convincing, but in this series not so. As a result I'd have to conclude the problem had to be the script. No small wonder the series was cancelled. The pleasant surprise was on the last DVD when I found there were only two episodes instead of four."
5,Great Series,Crusade was a great series that was short lived but the acting and special effects were second to none!
1,Really bad,"This show had everything that was wrong with B5 (bad acting, bad effects) without everything that made B5 good (great arcs and a scattering of interesting characters)"
2,Old but not good,"I love old sci-fi, but this was not very good and we only have watched the one episode so far. I plan on watching it all in the future, but I have a tough time recommending anyone spend their hard earned dollars on this one."
5,It had so much to offer and given so little time,Crusade had all kinds of good things going for it. But the powers to be could not see that giving it 13 Episodes was not long enough to get its feet on the ground.
3,I remember..,I remember tis show and all that it was about and I thought my older son would need to watch this guffy old sci fi.
4,"For Babylon 5 lovers, this is worth watching...",It is really a shame this series was cancelled before it really got off the ground. Crusade is well worth watching if you're a fan of Peter Woodward and other cast members.
4,crusade,not as strong as the babylon5 series but if it would have lasted five years like it was suppose too it would have been better
3,Not as good as B5,"Wanted a fix for missing B5 and bought this but not as good, but fits in with all the B5 sets I have."
3,Not as good as B5,"After watching this unfinished series to completion, I have to say that I wasn't nearly as captivated by Crusade as I was Babylon 5. It might have been different if they would have continued the series to some kind of conclusion, but they diddled around with it too much, then came up with a killer finale to make us mad that the series died. The characters weren't nearly as engaging as the characters in B5, Lochley was never one of my favorite characters anyway. Seeing Dr. Franklin in the last episode was a plus but it didn't make up for the blunders in previous episodes, there were too many boring episodes for a first season, my wife and I ended up not caring what happened.It could have been much better, it would definitely be interesting to see where this series might have gone, but we'll never know will we? -kd5-"
4,A must see for Sci-fi fans,"With the exception of the first episode (wich seemed rushed and not well thought out), I loved the rest of the short Crusade series. I especially enjoyed the technomages; by far the most interesting characters in the series. Crusade is a very creative, thought provoking and entertaining spin off of the award winnind Babylon 5 TV series. My biggest complaint is that the series was not allowed to be finished. The 13 eppisode made of the series is just the first part of an exciting adventure that biggins with the quaranteen of earth after a biological weapon was used against it. The members onboard the Excaliber ship are determined to find a cure. I really wish there was someway I could find out what happens after eppisode 13 and if a cure is ever found. Maybe someday there will be a Movie spinoff to complete the series."
4,Good but left you hanging.....,"Wish it went further, enjoyed it and the direction the story was taking. It's a shame it never progressed more seasons."
1,This dog does not run....,"I was going to write an eloquent and long-winded review.Forget it. This show bites.The ideas, acting, and scenarios are bad. NO suspension of disbelief. Poor set-up, bad history, and doesn't fit well with the rest of the B5 universe as previously set forth. JMS railed against the changes force on him by Turner's people - some of those changes were actually the BETTER ideas put forward in the show (the mystery box, changing character dynamics, etc).Most of the episodes contain at LEAST one fall-down laughing BAD moment. When you get to the Joan-of-Arc-channeling terrorist or the Mr. Kitty episode, you will know what I mean.If you are a B5 fan, AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE. It was actually DIMINISH your appreciation of the B5 franchise."
1,Lame,I am a big fan of the original series even with the 80s level of CG.But I did not like this series at all. The acting was so cheesy I couldnot watch more than 10 mins of it.
4,Brilliant Vision Cut Short,"For those of us that can never get enough of the Babylon 5 universe, Crusade provided another season (1/2 a season) of the incredible story arcs and character development that we'd learned to expect from J.M.S.As with the Firefly universe reawakened in the movie Serenity by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel), you either love it or you have never seen it . . .The cast/crew interviews on this DVD set are worth the purchase in-and-of themselves. A definite must-have for the J. Michael Straczynski fan."
2,This is a pump ONLY. No Faucet,"The pump arrived fine and is a good Jabsco pump. However, the picture and description are wrong. The title says it all ""Pump ONLY"". If you think this is a combination pump/faucet as the description says, you are wrong. This is ONLY for the pump.I'm giving this rating to the vendor ""gizmos for less"" not the pump. The pump should work just fine.I have since ordered the faucet and the shipping was over $12. That seems like high shipping for such a small part.Had I known that, I would have bought a pump combo for this same price on eBay. I was trying to be loyal to Amazon. I contacted Amazon customer service and they responded politely but informed me this is a 3rd party vendor and I should contact them directly. I really didn't feel like arguing with them."
5,12v galley pump,I bought this as a replacement for the pump on my pop-up. It was a match and fit just like the old pump. It works good and doe not make as much noise as the old motor.
1,Synthetic in every way,"This CD is perfect background if you run an assisted living center. It is the worst of John Tesh, Jon Schmidt, et al mixed into one gauzy mess with far too much synthesizer. If the electronic Jetsons-organ in Emerald Fantasy doesn't make your teeth hurt, you're deaf. Wouldn't be surprised if it comes with a lavender doily and a coupon for Depends."
1,Doesn't fit in slot and nozzle doesn't match,"I give up trying to order this part. None fit right. It needs to fit in a slot, and have the correct nozzle size for the tank unit. What a joke this is. Can't find part in parts store either. I will have to see if can get from GM directly and pay a small fortune. This or replace the whole tank unit.. They shouldn't sell things that don't fit. I can easily handle the electric part and the hose. But can not remold the plastic to fit a slot, nor want to chalk the opening. I'm not a plumber."
2,worked for less than one month and was very cheapo,"dont waste your money, just go to junk yard and get a real one out of a car for this washer pump. this annco was really cheap junk"
4,Windshield Washer,"I ordered this from a picture, and when I received it, it was exactly what I needed. It fit better than the original."
3,Rise and Shine,"Good tape but my wife and I prefer Ann Smith's earlier tape ""Stretching for Seniors""."
2,Slow paced and simple,Filmed in this couple's bedroom. It is mis-titled as it puts you to sleep with the slow pacing and the monotony of the 'trainer's' voice. She was a dancer and is very flexible. Didn't quite give me the wake up stretching I was looking for.
1,not what I expected,it was not the kind of stretching I was looking for. DVD was very miss leading. Wish I could return it. Wish you could view a little of it before you buy
1,The product may be good...,"but I wouldn't know. I placed an order for this product in EARLY August of 2003. I never received the order, and just today(October 13,2003) I get an e-mail saying that a credit was coming to me for the order. The only other communication I received was a very lame voice mail asking me why I was being negative about the situation!!!!As I said, the product may be OK, but the company selling it is horrible. AVOID THEM IF YOU CAN...buyer beware...you'll be kept waiting too"
5,I wish I knew this earlier...,"I LOVE this book! It is amazing! It makes you realize you are not alone or crazy in the world of infant reflux and gives you the power and knowledge to speak up for your little one. I love everything about this book. It's easy to read and so informative. If your child has been labeled as ""colicky"" or having reflux this is a must read for you!"
5,A MUST read for any parent!!!,"This book was absolutely incredible! Truly. As a parent of a little GERDling, we couldn't have survived without this book. It is so validating for any parent who has been shoved out the door by doctor after doctor with ""colic"" as the end diagnosis. This book was the best money we ever spent!!!!"
5,This Book Answers Why Your Baby is Miserable !,"This book helps you explain to your pediatrician that your baby needs their help.I have recommended this book to a dozen clients with hard to understand babies, and the baby's that are just so uncomfortable. They all agreed knowing and understanding what this author writes about - silent reflex and GERD is the essential missing information to recognizing cues, and behaviours your baby is having.All my clients are exclusively breastfeeding, we looked at the breastfeeding management issues to insure it was not overly supply issues, or a fast let down or other mis-management breastfeeding problems.Then when they tried eliminating dairy from their own diet and this does not do the trick, you really have to LOOK AT THE BABY and get the baby help."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"If you have an infant who cries constantly and you are at your wits end, you need to get this book! This book saved my sanity! My daughter started crying non-stop when she was about 2 weeks old. The doctor diagnosed her with reflux and put her on zantac....however, the crying persisted.It was only after I read this book that I discovered what was truely wrong with her. In the book he describes the correlation between reflux and milk allergy in infants. Low and behold, our daughter is allergic to milk, soy, and eggs. If it wasn't for this book we would still be listening to her cry, believing it was just ""colic."" After reading ""The Happiest Baby on the Block,"" I felt like such a failure....this book help me to realize that until you SOLVE the problem of painful reflux, or milk allergy, the 5 S's won't do a darn thing!!! PLEASE get this book if you are dealing with the same thing. Your infant deserves peace and so do you!"
5,For Parents of GERDlings,"This isn't a book about 'colic'. It is a book about Reflux in infants. This is an invaluable tool in helping you make changes in what you do as a parent to help alleviate the symptoms of acid reflux. It is also useful in helping you prepare for visits with the pediatrician armed with information, questions, and the kind of demeanor that is most likely to get the doctor's cooperation. As a desperate parent of a GERDling, I found the book practical and realistic."
4,Forgotten piece of history,"Television was considered the wave of the future in the 1930s and as such Nazi Germany invested resources in becoming a leader in the field. This program discussed programming more than the technology that was involved, but even so is was very interesting. Due to the novelty of television and the inordinate amount of resources it took compared to radio the medium was not used much during the war, when everything had to be justified as being vital to the war effort.Some very rare footage (recovered from East German archives) and interviews of surviving participants in German TV makes this a must if you want to learn more about early television."
1,broken,"This is a pretty poor product. I took the car adapter, and plugged it in. It lit up, then 5 seconds after plugging my psp into the adapter the thing died and has not worked since. The ac plug works fine, but I bought it for the car charger."
5,tangy and hot - the best!,"I love Crystal! Tangy and hot, it goes on any dish...rice, meat, eggs, etc. It really allows you to enjoy the flavor of the sauce, AND the flavor of the food. With some other hot sauces, your mouth is scalded by the heat of the sauce. Not with Crystal. I always keep an extra bottle around."
1,10 bucks for a bottle that sells for $1.50 in groceries?,I love Crystal and pour it on virtually everything I eat. But the 12 oz. bottle will cost you well under two bucks in any grocery store that carries it. Ten dollars? Bizarre.
2,Only for the comic-book marial arts fan,"the black mask is certainly less westernised than Jet Li's recent films, and has a very comic book style story and fight choreographing. It is about an elite group of assasins who 'feel no pain' due to genetic experiments, and plan to inflict evil upon asia, cue Jet li, the only 1 who can stop them. The good martial arts don't come until the last few scenes, and are often too fast to appreciate.All in all, a cheesy film with a cheesy storyline, with just about acceptable martial arts. For better martial arts try the 'Once upon a time in China' series, or 'romeo must die'. For better storyline, try ANYTHING else."
3,Standard H-K Fare,"Although thousands have flocked to their local video store to catch some more of Jet Li's fantastic moves after his appearance in Lethal Weapon 4, this movie is not one of his better efforts. There is little doubt that Li is the nastier, less PC version of J. Chan, however the Black Mask is not the best showcase for his talents. This is still a solid chop-sockey flick that entertains, though; there just happens to be much better out there."
4,the Scent of Murder,"A fun read about the goings-on in a busy shopping mall that climax in murder in a department store. Is the scented vandalism connected with the murder? That's what Marissa has to answer when the body of the woman who stole her husband is found draped over her desk. Marissa must find the murderer to keep herself from being charged with murder. An ailing child, an incompetent boss and others add to her problems making the situation almost chaotic. I recommend this book to any mystery fan. Lots of false trails and suspects."
2,Trying too hard to be cute,"I was not prepared for the kind of ""adult Nancy Drew"" that this book turned out to be. Yet another murder mystery with involvement by an amateur sleuth, dopey love interests and heavy-handed, myopic police. I finished the book but would be hard-pressed to recommend it. Sophomoric is the word that comes to mind."
2,sophmoric,I had hoped for a light hearted comedy/romance. It was just plain boring and badly edited. Sorry to say it was a waste of time. It was like overhearing a teenagers lament about indecision and old boyfriends. The main character was indecisive and waffled. wimpy.
3,Good Beach Read,Light enjoyable reading. Not to many books are set into the modern retail world. The story line is pretty good.
4,Action-Packed,"Shodows Runners is the 3rd in the 2176 series, and Liz Maverick 2nd book. Wow, the action started at the beginning and never slowed down. Jenny is a tough heroine, always ready to fight or run for survival. Deck need her knowledge of Newgate (Hell on Earth) to complete his mission for the Shodow Runners. Jenny already excaped hell once now he asking her to return with him for his cause. Jenny not going to give in earily and Deck not giving up. I can't wait to see what else Maverick writes. She on my ""to watch"" list for future reads.This is a must have series!The other books are#1 The Legend of Banzai Maguire, by Susan GrantAnother wonderful book!#2 Day of Fire, by Kathleen NanceI loved this book!The Shodow Runner is #3#4 The Power of Two, by Patti O'Sheanot out yet#5 The Scarlet Empress, By Susan Grantnot out yetMore Sci-fi romance like these need to be written!"
5,Marverick first Romance is strong!,"I know she has written a novella and a chit lit book, but this is her first paranormal romance and I am SO IMPRESSED.Jenny Red is such a strong character. So his is Deck, though I did have a few problems with how he was willing to use Jenny, sentencing someone he cared about to the hell that was Newgate, just so he could turn around and use her to get him in. I really had problems with that and it kept me from loving him.Maverick is a talented writer and this is a super book, so I really hope she keeps writing romance"
3,Somewhat tame,I had thought it was going to be along the lines of other books I purchased since it came up as a suggestion. Nothing I would purchase in hardcover to keep.
3,Getting a bit formulaic,"The first book in the ""2176"" series (""The Legend of Banzai Maguire"", by Susan Grant) was great. The second one (""Day of Fire"", by Kathleen Nance) was also quite good. However, IMHO, ""The Shadow Runners"" is formulaic and confused. Also, the books all have very similar plot points;1. Boy meets girl (classic, no?).2. Boy drags girl along on a whirlwind adventure (or the other way 'round; whatever).3. Boy & girl have hot monkey sex, but despair of a ""real"" relationship because of their careers, respective social standing, etc.4. Boy & girl defy convention and live happily ever after (or so we presume).5. The End.I may be asking for too much (I mean, it's a romance novel; how original can you get when you have to start with ""Boy meets girl""?), but I really thought that ""The Shadow Runners"" was a little too cliched, and the plot was rather jumbled. That's all."
1,not helpful,After a quick scan this book was returned as it offered very little insight to the individual colleges that could not easily be picked up online. The information provided had no depth as comments were very standardized.
3,SADE,"Movie is Ok.. but not what I expected. A little slow at the beginning and with some dialog not translated. A little crude, but then again, that is what the Marquis De Sade was known for."
3,Sometimes a Struggle,"This was a Christmas gift and I do like the knife sharpener on it. It really put a good edge on my dull paring knife.Unfortunately as the other reviewers mention it's not easy to use the can opener part. We struggled to get the can in the right place for the action to cut into the lid and do its job.Most of the time, I just reach for my hand-turned can opener. Easy to use and store in a drawer. We keep this automatic one on the counter top, but rarely use it. Maybe if I'd make an effort to use it more, I'd get used to the right way to get the can in position."
1,Don't waste your money,"Horrible! This thing may open 1 out of ten cans without having to fight with it. It jams, tries to eat the cans leaving metal slivers in your fingers & on top of the can, if you can get it to grip a can you have to hold & guide it & hope for the best, not to mention the can drips all over the place because you almost always have to tilt the can up for the blade to cut. Pass this one by...you may end up starving before you get a can opened with it."
4,Automatic Can opener,The Automatic Can Opener is a good product. It is easy to use. It is a product that is a good price to purchase.The product only comes in one color.
3,Not as good as I thought It would be,the top part of the machine often falls off but when it stay on it does work fine
3,Great music poorly recorded.,"Love this music, close to the core of the Kobialka experience, but the sound engineering is terrible so I rarely play it.The quality sounds as if it could have been recorded at the kitchen table. Daniel, could you please redo it on top quality equipment?"
3,"Okay, but...","This is very cute and inexpensive, but the ring that attaches the heart is kinda big and will hurt your toe or get bent if it touches any part of your shoe or sandal."
1,outstanding,"We have listened to your cd + just can't believe how well it's done. We are looking foward to more of your talent . Do you ever go on tour? Keep up the good work , we PRAY the good Lord helps you get what you deserve!"
1,amazing,"When you were in Canada, the music was amazing. We heard you were on tour again, we hope you are comming back. Hope to catch up to you soon."
2,A little dry for my taste..........,"History has always fascinated me, but I guess this is just a bit more tasteless than what I am used to."
3,2007 edition available as an eBook,"I haven't had time to read through it yet. But the Baby Bargains book was pretty helpful (though too dependent on the anecdote in some cases). I'm hoping this will be similar.I downloaded the 2007 edition from the Baby Bargains website since the print version offered at Amazon is 3 years out of date. The eBook is in PDF format and readable by any computer with a recent version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. It's also cheaper than the paperback.On the plus side you can do immediate text searches within the book and you could print out just the relevant info for your shopping trips. On the negative side, you won't have a copy to casually flip through. Everytime, you'll need to boot up your computer or PDA (or PSP running a homebrew PDF reader)."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with this book. I was really looking forward to reading it since I own Baby Bargains and recommend it to anyone I know. This is a huge disappointment compared to Baby Bargains. Most of the reviews are pretty general, and as one reviewer stated, the information can be found on-line. I thought it would cover a lot more product than it does. I purchased the book looking for information on 2 separate items (umbrella/travel strollers and bike trailers) and was unsatisfied with the information. Umbrella strollers aren't even mentioned, and bike trailers consist of one page with only one review. Not at all what I had expected. Had I flipped thru the pages before buying I could have saved myself a few dollars."
3,Helpful for Moms with Young Tots,"Although it is not as thorough as Baby 411, Toddler 411 will give any parent great tips on finding bargains and quality products for your toddler. Some info is geared towards younger tots, whereas other parts of the book jump to 3 or 4 year olds. I wish there was some way to bring out the 18 month to 2.5 year old phase, but perhaps new editions will address this. Overall, I love Denise and Alan Fields, their sense of humor, and great parent purchase wisdom! Buy this book used and save even MORE money on your toddler!"
2,not so warm for 100gram,"I was getting these gloves in hopes they would keep me warm in the wind and cold. I was under the impression 100 gram thinsulate would be a lot warmer. Actually, the 40 gram thinsulate from walmart with the holes for the fingers to come out was warmer. I did give them two stars because they are soft, fuzzy inside and reasonably priced. As far as the wind goes, I don't know how, but it goes right through them. I did a pressure test by blowing into them and it was like breathing air. I am pretty disappointed with these gloves. I will not be wearing them in anything colder than about 40 degrees... maybe 30 degrees for short periods. Based on its initial description I find that laughable. Thank god they are cheap enough to be throw gloves."
5,Awesome addition to Bionicle,"I've been a Bionicle fan from the start in Summer 2001, and let me tell you, this movie flows right along with the storyline. I expected much less, and got much more to say the least. The only thing I Didn't like were the voice actors. The only ones that reallty fit the character they played were Kopaka, Thau, Vakama, and Hahli. Everyone else just wasn't the right voice for the job, especially Lewa, though he is saved by the actor's great depiction of how he talks (like using terms such as ""high-flying"" or ""wind-walking"")."
5,Surprisingly good sci-fi,"We bought this movie for my five-year-old Bionicle crazy son. My husband has read him the comic books that come with Lego magazine. I didn't know much about the story. I was really amazed at how good the movie was. It had a complete story line. The graphics were excellent and I have become somewhat a Bionicle fan, myself now. I must admit fatigue from hearing about them 12 hours a day, but this movie was really fun and exciting. The animators did a great job bringing the Bionicles to life. We look forward to the next movie."
4,My Review for Bionicle; Mask of Light - The first movie,"Hi. My name is Nicholas (I feel I should express my first name)and I received this DVD. It is a very awesome movie, with plenty of action, and lots of the familiar Matoran saying, ""Unity, Duty, Destiny"". It is the first Bionicle movie and it is AWESOME! I rate it 4 stars because, it is a very awesome movie, but I have heard that Bionicle 2 movie will be better. And nothing is better than five stars!From a true Bionicle fan, Nicholas"
2,"Mindless and Nonsensical, but Well Done","I'm at a loss to explain the 5 star ratings this film got. It literally has no plot. Tons and tons of expository dialogue to explain the ""mythology"" (so that your 5 year old feels justified in demanding that you buy all the ""characters"") and ""glory shots"" of things getting blown up and characters running and screaming. But it has so much jargon that if you're not already familiar with the characters, the plot will make no sense. My son's Dad and I have watched it with my 6yo son (who admittedly loves it even though he can't explain what it's about either) and we still can't discern an actual plot.Harmless fluff, I guess, but my money would have been much better spent on other, much better videos."
1,"Greg Farshtey, no story, no duh!","Greg Farshtey must go down in history as the worst storyteller for boys ever. His books are ponderous, and my 7-year-old, tho he's watched this repeated times, enjoys poking fun at all the holes in the plot, setting, characterizations, etc. Put it together with the other Bionicle movies, and the plot holes are as wide as - well, the Makuta! He enjoyed Bionicles a few years ago, but became bored with them, tho. Why? Lack of a comprehensible storyline to play with them! Lego's switch to ""Hero Factory"" - aka Bionicle remake - is equally terrible. Would not recommend."
2,Not What I Expected,"When I watched this movie,I expected a movie like the Bionicle comics by Rob Zombie.Instead,I get this kiddish piece of (beeping noise).This movie should have been dark like the comics.This movie is almost like it was made for 5-year olds.Also,another gripe.Sometimes,in the movie,the animation is a bit choppy,and sometimes it speeds up.This is unacceptable these days.Overall,this is a lackluster movie that was probably made on a budget of $500. Spend your money on a better movie."
1,Did not work,"I purchased this for my son's birthday. Neither our home DVD player of our computer would recognize the disc. We continually got an error message. ""It was the worst birthday ever."""
4,Break out the Magnifying Glass!,"The DVD is great, especially the slow motion reviews of Burton's playing. The only gripe I have is with the tab booklet: IT IS TOO SMALL TO READ."
4,"Informative and helpful, but for the ADVANCED guitarist!","I bought this video in attempt to be just as good country guitarist than I am a rock and blues guitarist (I also own the Eric Johnson video Total Electric Guitar). James' fingerstyle is NOT recommended for everybody that's used to using a straight pick and it requires precise practice and patience (I still have a lot to learn on this video). So far I've been able not only gain appreciation for Mr. Burton as a player, but also gain interest in country guitar far beyond the ""twang"" of his Tele. As far as actually learning his playing style, that's another story (So far...still straight pickin)."
5,James Burton Guitar Playing Instruction DVD,This is not suited to be a beginner's first instructional DVD. It is best for a person who knows of and appreciates James Burton's style and capability. It is very good for one who wants to know how Burton accomplishes some of the effects unique to him.
2,"great player, not so great teacher",mr. burton fails to give fret numbers or notes in his demo which will be confusing to the beginning player. Also he does not discuss in depth his muteing technique in detail and some fingering is hard to pick up. If you have a good ear this video will be helpful as he is a very inventive player and has a style worth knowing. I just hope any future videos will be more inclusive. mark brinsfield
3,"Fun to watch, not really an instructional video","This is really more of a demonstration video than an instructional video. Like many great players, Mr. Burton is not a guitar teacher, so you have to be ready to capture what you can from what he shows on the video. This DVD was originally released as VHS. The hot licks people added sections that slow down the examples so you'll have a chance to figure out what James is doing. I consider it a good resource that I will go back to over time, but not really a how-to guide. I recommend viewing this in a player or on a computer that will allow you to do your own slow-down and repeats."
2,Books like this one is what makes history boring.,"I brought this book thinking it was be an insight into the 1930s,but it is a dull book written for children. It's not worth [what] I paid. Buyer beware."
3,For ARR,"Anyhow, overall, an average album for ARR, but very much above average for almost all other composers. ARR really shows his talent with the variety of music styles in this album and the singing creativity shown by the singers. So, why are you still reading this review? Go hear it or get it for ""Chaand Aaya Re"" if nothing else."
2,We've waited four long years for this?,"Although I want to like it, I can't help but being deceived by this release. I considered Marisa as one of the most promising Brazilian singers, as all her previous albums were very creative and original, but here she falls in the anodyne mainstream pop/rock trend, with sugary ballads and dummy rock numbers. Besides, the extremely overelaborated arrangements interfere to much in her vocals. In fact, just three of the tracks are appealing to me: ""Para ver as meninas"", a melancholic samba, ""Perdo voc"", a Carlinhos Brown song composed especially for this album which is the only really fresh, creative track, and the Marisa Monte composition ""Abolol"", fortunately only accompanied by piano. In average, an avoidable album. If you don't have her previous releases, buy those ones, since they are much better. And let's hope this album is just an anomaly in her career which won't happen again."
3,"Still good, but not her best","Well, I finally received this CD. I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but I will also say I'm not surprised that she still hasn't surpassed the perfection that is ""Rose & Charcoal"". The songs on this CD, although good, are not as strong as the songs on ""Rose"" (or even ""Barulhinho Bom"")--which is surprising, considering people such as Carlinhos Brown contributed. The production is very nice, and the playing is up to par (although not as ""native"" as I would like). If you're already a Marisa Monte fan, this, of course, is a must-have and won't disappoint you. But if you want to discover the diva that is Marisa, start with ""Rose & Charcoal""."
3,Marisa in love,"This album was a departure for Marisa, a concept album of love songs, and as such, it's a slight disappointment. It seems like Maria could have come up with a better concept. This field has, after all, been pretty well plowed, and she doesn't offer much additional insight into the topic. Amor I love you is about as deep as it gets. With a few exceptions, the lyrics are forgetable. Aside from being lyrically unambitious, the music is more stripped down as well. This is straightforward pop, not the exploration and amalgamation of Brazilian and other styles that made Marisa the most important Brazilian musician of her generation. Still and all, this album grows on you. Marisa writes beautiful melodies, the songs have progressive and inventive arrangements, and the production is impecable. And in the end, the bottom line with Marisa is the voice, as stunning as ever. She could be singing ""God Save the Queen"" or ""Mersey-dotes,"" it would still be worth listening."
4,Try it out,"This album brings Marisa Monte to what she is: a smooth and enriched mixture of bossanova, pop, pagode and guitars... I like it: it is full of love and passion and, at the same time, sweetness and sorrow... Fortunately she has been evoluting since her last album, i don't want her to change, but I don't want her albums to get repetitive... Despite it all, her voice is still tender and accurate and her producer is still worried about its instrumental influences (from the piano, guitars, bass to brazilian textures) what makes this album a ""must have"" if you are a fan or a simple admirer of soft but good music!"
1,Unhappy,The product is much too noisey and feels cheaply made. It also does not do a decent job of removing lint or pills.
1,Don't buy - Doesn't work at all,"Hi,I bought this lint fabric shaver because it was economically priced, but when I used it, it didn't pick up any lint. My advice is to spend a little more on a different lint product and hopefully you'll get better results. Thanks."
1,WARNING!,"1. Product failed to function upon initial insert of batteries.2. On 3rd load of batteries product turned ON, but was EXCEEDINGLY noisy.3. Product failed to remove ANY pilling or lint from 3 different surfaces.4. READ this company's return policy CAREFULLY!... Will NOT refund any aspect of shipping (Note: shipping was above average to begin with).5. Based on the low quality ogf this item, I would not feel comfortable reselling it nor will the loss of time and return shipping fees make it practical to return... it will be thrown out.:(Hope this is helpful; Sincerely,BT"
2,Keep it on the TV,This little gadget is a wonder. I wonder how to get the battery cover on. I wonder if the batteries are good since the shaver doesn't come on. I wonder why it's so loud. I wonder if I should have my head examined for buying this fool's paradise.Lots of hype here. Not much to back up the hype. Want quality and durability? Look elsewhere.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I used it once and the on/off switch no longer worked. After I received it in the mail, I recognized it as the same kind I had a few years ago. The switch broke quite quickly on that one too."
1,"Run, don't walk away","3 things:#1 - This shaver failed to fire up until the batteries were removed and added 3 times, all the same way. When it started it was noisy.#2 - The light is useless - it is face down under the shaver - it does not help you see the stuff you want to shave.#3 - The shaver does not shave. I thought maybe there was packing material that I needed to remove in order for it to work. No packing material and then when I screwed it back in, I had to do that bettery dance again. Still does not work. It is GARBAGE! Do not buy it."
1,Not so happy-but company is good.,"I have used fabric shavers in the past. They were better made. Of the two I ordered,one was defective and ther other eats fabric. I started to process the one defective shaver but I was not hooked up to a printer. The company is willing to take the shaver(s) back. It's just not worth my time to worry about it. I will buy a better quality shaver."
2,Doesn't work well,"I have had a similar product in the past, and I was excited to find this replacement. But, it doesn't work well at all-it barely removes any lint balls. Also, the battery cover was difficult to close after the batteries were inserted-seems cheaply made.I hope someone can recommend a better lint shaver."
1,Jumbo Super Lint Buster,"The bad news is that I waited until now to use the product. Even worse is that not only does the product appear to be used, but it does not even work. Very disappointed since it was supposed to be new. When I opened it, I notice several scratches on it and it was dirty...Again, very disappointed."
4,Blade Refills,"I like this product,however I would love it,if I could purchase new blades instesd of having to buy new product."
1,Big and useless,"This is the worse thing I have ever bought through amazon and I buy a lot from amazon. Please wish I could get my money back. This lint buster makes a lot of noice and picks up no lint at all...I was excited to get this item as it seems useful but I was MOST DISAPPOINTED. DO NOT BUY. better to buy a regular lint roller. Then to add insult to injury this useless thing uses two batteries. To sum it up USELESS, VERY NOISY AND THE COMMERCIALS ARE VERY MISLEADING. VERY SAD....DO NOT BUY. Your clothes looks worse after using this thing as it buries the lint on the garment making it look worse and harder to clean off. I NEED MY MONEY BACK......."
1,Pure garbage!!!!,Don't waste your time with this product!! It isn't worth the lint it attempts to shave. I used it in 1 spot for 10 minutes and the lint just laughed at it. I returned it the very same day. What a waste!!
1,fabric shaver.,product was junk. it was used and broken. now i am out fifteen dollars. don't order one. i am totally disatisfied.
1,STOP! DON'T BUY IT!,"Bought 3, sent back 3, tried to get batteries to stay in long enough to bust some lint or just make a little buzzzzzzz. ZIP<>ZULCH<>NADA!!! Had to rate one star to submit<<<<MY RATING..ZERO!!!!>>>"
3,Not as fast & easy as I was hoping for,"When I think of a family night lesson, I think of something more comprehensive than this book offers. I picture a short spiritual thought and an activity that reinforces that thought. For example, for Christmas my family taught about the wiseman by letting my girl dress up as a wiseman. As a wiseman, her mission was to find baby Jesus. We taped a star over the hidden baby doll to help her find him. This type of activity is not what this book offers. There are no suggested activities. The book merely gives short spiritual thoughts/stories from the scriptures (the Bible and Mormon scriptures as well) with some background context."
5,Best resource for young families!,"We got this book when my oldest was a year old, and it is exactly what we needed!! I knew we were supposed to be doing family night, but I'm not very creative and was kind of at a loss as to what to do for lessons for our young family. The lessons are the perfect length, about 2 minutes, very basic and come with a scripture and song that go along with the lesson. We also use the Gospel Art Kit along with the book so the kids have something to look at it. Family Night requires virtually no planning in our house (hooray!) and it's gotten our little family in the habit of having a regular family night. So thankful for this book!!"
5,Great Resource,"This is a great book for pulling together a Family Home Evening quickly and effectively for BUSY families. The lessons can also be adapted for older children, so don't have the impression that it is only for families with very young children. Very helpful book!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I guess I was a little confused, I thought this book would give you ideas on different things to do with your family to have fun but it was more on teaching lessons on morals and values. Though it was a nice book especially for parents with religious values (like myself) I already had a book like this called Raising Kids with Good Character so I really more just wanted a book to give me ideas on things to do with the family like game night, movie night, camping, etc. just fun things I can do with my kids."
3,Excellent Overview,FM-23 Is like most FM or Field Manuals for those who have not had the pleasure to serve this fine Nation. FM-23 Sniper Training is a good source of knowledge for anyone interested in getting a general idea of what kind of training requirments are demand of the snipers generally in the USA. Having been an active duty Marine I found it an interesting contrast to the Program given by Mother Greens Killing Machine. I would recomend this book for acedemic purposes to individuals whishing to divine more into the world of the sniper but do not take it as gospel. Like they always say there's the write way and then the right way
3,"REVIEW OF ""FM 23-10 SNIPER TRAINING""","This book is a good source of information about basic high-power rifle shooting, basic use of telescopic sights, basic marksmanship, basic field craft, that can be applied to hunting medium and big game animals. However the lesson-plan format which the information is presented is hard to follow. But the information is there and can be effectivly used if the reader has some patients."
1,The Army doesn't get it.,Having served in the Fourth Infantry Division in combat I feel that the Army started losing their rifleman skills a long time ago. Look to the Marine Corps if you want to learn to shoot. This has been true since Vietnam times.I qualified expert with the M14 yet I'm presently still learning from a Marine Corps Scout Sniper. You might try [...]
5,Excellent Writing Advice,"If you want a good companion book to ""Elements of Style"", this is it. Sasha provides sound, straightforward advice about writing, along with good technical expertise. She highlights many pitfalls and stumbling blocks that many new writers might encounter, then tells the reader what to do about them. Recommended!"
4,creepy crypts,"I am so glad there are creative people out there who make things like this. There are some standouts in this collection like The Mausoleum. The sound effects are so 3D like you feel like you are the traveler in some of these tales. They literally put you in the place of storytelling. This CD reminds me of the storytelling process of Walt Disney's CHILLING THRILLING SOUNDS OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE back in the 60's where the narrator set up the story and allowed the sound effects to tell, plus conclude the eerie story. Great stuff, and a must have for all halloween soundtrack buffs. Get your stereo, boombox, or house speakers tuned up!"
5,Horror soundeffects!,I bought this cd of horror sounds after listening to it years back. It brought back alot of great Halloween memories and I'll be using it for the trick or treaters. It's probably the spookiest cd that contains horror sounds and screams for your buck. I recommend it alot!
4,It's scary with lots of god sound effects.,I bought it to replace the cassette I have enjoyed for years. My kids and grand kids all enjoy listening to it.
2,Not a quick as expected,I have a black car and this product is much harder to remove than the other quick wax products I have tried. It would be just as easy to use regular wax. I would never reorder this.
3,"Provincial but Moving Poetry, Good in Heart, Not in Craft","Though this poetry is provincial in form and content, it has a heart and its content often transcends its craft. Still, its the sort of poetry that the average reader who is not in love with the craft and knowledgeable about it will enjoy. What it lacks in sophistication, it often makes up for in feeling and insight into the human family in its everyday life--especially the Italian American family of New Jersey. A pleasant and easy read, if not terribly original in style."
4,"Awesome instruction, but the music is so-so","I LOVE this video - not for beginners though. It's quite challenging and very well rounded. As many people have said, the music isn't great. Kinda circusy. However, once you learn the skills, use them with whatever music you choose!"
4,Good,I loved how much there is on these dvds but was a little disappointed with the yoga bit of it...I found it a tad boring and too repetitive. I'm more of a vinyasa girl myself. Rachel is great at explaining things and all around lovely.
5,Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice,Received item on time and an excellent shape I am very pleased in with Amazon and the individuals providing their service on a timely manner.
3,Awesome - just what I was looking for!,"I've been loving Rachel Brice! This video, while I just started it, looks like the PERFECT introduction to yoga for bellydance, choreography and overall tribal fusion bellydance. Can't wait to do it again!"
5,Rachel Brice's Bellydance is Superb!,"Okay if you're an experienced belly dancer wanting to up your performance, this is a great DVD to buy! It's designed to take you up to the next level. If you're a beginner, this has ALOT of isolation technique work which will help to give you the fundamentals for you to learn belly dance seriously.Rachel Brice takes it slow, shows each move step by step and then slowly speeds it up so that you can follow it and enjoy--but boy those drills left me SORE! Which is good because it meant that I was using muscles that I hadn't used before;) The yoga helped me to stretch out my body, particularly my back, and was a great warm up. Takes a bit of time, but I highly recommend this to any belly dancer who wants to learn more about technique, layering moves and wants to push herself to be the best dancer that she can be;)Johari"
2,Not for beginners,"Based on the reviews, I thought this would be great intro to belly dancing. If I had a dance back ground, I think this would be perfect. The yoga section is elementary. The beginning of the dance section goes from zero to 60 in 3 seconds. Too hard to follow. Not interesting to watch. Money wasted..."
5,Great for working out -- Love It!,"I'm building my workout DVD collection with activities that are not considered traditional workouts. I wanted a Belly Dance DVD where the instructor was a bit more believable than a lot of the others, and I found all that I was looking for in Serpentine! This is the perfect addition. With this DVD you can pick and choose which segments you want for your workouts, or for your belly dance learning experience.I love that there are 2 DVDs:DVD #1: Focuses on yoga strength training for belly dance,isolation & shimmy drills.DVD #2: You get to see choreography, then the demo, then the choreography is broken up into loops so that you can practice a part over and over again.Great idea!"
2,not the greatest bought it to fix another one of the same due to data left in the old hardrive,"not the greatest bought it to fix another one of the same due to data left in the old hardrive. Why would a working hardrive would stop working before any other parts in the computer. Never had a problem with WD, seagate gets a bad feedback for this one.."
3,A boy murdered his father and the jury is deciding his fate,It was a very interesting book and gave alot of information on the way a jury room might be run and the attitudes of some people in there on the jury. You learn alot from this book. There so many different personalities of people that are shown through out this entire book.
4,a good classic worth reading,i decided to read this book after reading about it in black issues book review. I twas a great story and well ahead of its time. Main character is a farm girl who decides that single parenthood is the route for her. It is interesting to note the attitudes then about this issue vs ours today. This book is hard to find and you may have to special order but it is worth it
5,Addie Meets Max,My own two boys and numerous classes of my kindergarten children have truly enjoyed this book! It is the wonderful tale of a new friendship that starts out with a very bumpy beginning. This book lends itself quite easily to dramatic readings which my kinderkids thoroughly enjoy. I am delighted to find that there are two more books about Addie!
3,"Good, except doesn't get hot enough.","I like all the features of this deep fryer, except for one major detail. It doesn't get hot enough! Granted, it only falls short by 10 degrees (365¡ instead of it's 375¡ setting), but when it comes time to fry Chinese rice sticks, for example, they just don't get done. French fries come okay though, so I guess how it'll suit you depends on what you'll be using it for.Couple the thermostat problem with the fact that it's a bit on the small size, and you may be even less satisfied. If, for example, you load it to capacity with frozen fries, expect the temperature to drop dramatically. Plus, even when it's loaded to capacity, it barely cooks enough food for my family of four (two of which are two young girls who eat like fleas.)I suppose I'd recommend it for serving one or two people at a time, and only if it's used for less peculiar types of foods than rice sticks."
1,TEMPERATURE LIES,"I was excited about this little deep fryer when I first got it, but I soon realized that it doesn't get hot enough. At first it was just a little off, but after repeated use (a few times)I found that it doesn't get any hotter than 300 degrees! Much less than the stated 375 degrees. So unless you want to have greasy boiled food, do not buy this product."
3,Problem with the lid,I bought this fryer 8 months ago and it worked like a dream for about six months but now the lid keeps coming off every time the fryer gets hot because the plastic holding it to the back of the fryer has become loose and it doesn`t hold it in place anymore. The nonstick interior is good but it should be removable to make clean up easier.
1,poor quality product returned,I thought I was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor. I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil & water from condensation dripping down the side. I returned the product and received a full refund. The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people.
2,Make sure you keep receipt & warranty,"I have owned 2 of these fryers....2 years in a row. Suffice to say their reliability over the long term is dubious at best.The problem that I've encountered after awhile of use is that though the indicator lights are on......the unit stops heating. Given that the heating coil is integrated into the Oil well itself may have something to do with it.However, it does do the job and the Basket and cover are convenient. it does have a relatively large basket and the oil well is constructed of pretty heavy metal and is easy to remove. Not the easiest thing to clean.Just make sure to keep your receipt & warranty booklet because you're gonna need it (they did replace the broken ones quickly however)."
4,"Not Outstanding, but good enough most of the time.","This is a good slightly above average deep fryer. The window to see the food is an added bonus, however, it loses a star for being difficult to clean. I also agree with another user that if you drop in too many frozen items the temperature takes quite a shock for longer than one would expect. It has, however, held up over fairly regular usage for over a year now for me, so I will give it four stars."
2,Too cool oil is not cool,"I purchased this deep fryer because I liked the design and features. However, after using it a few times it seemed to me that the oil didn't heat up to the selected temperature. Using my trusty candy thermometer (which i knew to be very accurate) I checked the accuracy of the thermostat. I found that my unit maintained the oil at 15 degrees lower than as set."
5,Wonderful for all ages!,This book is a must have for anyone who grew up near the rocky seacoast of New England. The story is written well and the book is beautifully illustrated. The author also includes activities with sea glass at the end of the book.
4,The Story o the Sea Glass,"Beautiful illustrations, nice story. A little old school, but great for conversations. I had to change a few words when reading to a group, but lovely story otherwise. A lesson to teach is how we care for our earth now and not throw things in the ocean, but a long time ago that's what they did and one good thing that came from it, we now have beach glass."
5,Hidden gem,This is one of those type books that every luthier should at least read if not buy that focuses on sound quality with a different approach than most.
2,Out of Date,"This book has honorable intentions. However, the publisher/author did not bother to update the information prior to republishing in 1999. I have already received notices from 15 contacts in the book that they are either no longer functioning, the address is no longer valid, or the email is no longer valid. You'd be just as well off looking at an older (and free) version in the library. Should the publisher/author wish to invest a little time and some rewriting, the book might once again be useful in the year 2000."
3,Okay - but old content,"As one who served two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Iran, 1970-72; I wonder why anyone would choose an alternative to the Peace Corps. Peace Corps language training is superlative. The Peace Corps has always manifested altruism. It took two years to learn both spoken colloquial and spoken literary Persian. I was just beginning to learn Classical Persian when the two years were came to an end. I also learned written Persian in the form of Naskh, Nastaliq, and Shekastay, (the last being highly cursive)."
5,MY QUOTES,IT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME. IM A UP & COMING GRAPHICS DESIGNER. I FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT DEKE MCCLELLAND IN CS2
5,These Total Training programs are good,"If you are new to a program, especially Illustrator you should get this (for your version of illustrator).Actually for the price you may want to get the CS2 or 3 training even if you have newer software. It wont match up perfect but you'll learn a lot and save some $$.I'm not new to illustrator but I wanted training for some advanced topics that I havent learned yet.In the past I used TT for Flash and Dreamweaver. Both were very good and this was great too. For $25 it was a no brainer and even at the price of the newest version it's worth it for the time it saves you in learning the software."
1,Terrible,Terrible.... Not a flat iron spray at all. Do not waste your money! Very sticky and resembles hairspray. Do not recommend
2,broken,"I recieved my item broken and I contacted the vendor to let them know it was broken they offered to send me a new one in which I never received. Although at the time if I put the nozel back on, it will spray but it wont continue to work the whole time."
4,Good!,Good and quick shipping.The product felt more like I was using a hairspray instead of a protector. It felt heavy on my hair.
5,Cowboy Bebop does not have an equal...,"There are very very few anime series which the viewer is drawn into so complete as this one. It plays off every emotion under the spectrum, from hatred to love to comedy. You're laughing one minute and on the edge of your seat the next.This last DVD in may very well contain the best four episodes of the entire series (although the two-parter ""Jupiter Jazz"" on DVD #3 is close behind in that). Everything is brought to conclusion and in a very adult manner. If you're looking for the brave hero walking off into the sunset, think again. But this is even more reason to see this series. The story is as real as it can be, as gut wrenching as anything, and while the ending isn't what you may want to see, you're still left feeling fullfilled.This series is worth the money to buy. And if you've come through the past 5 DVDs already, then there isn't any reason to be reading this review, you should already have bought this DVD."
5,Thrilling,"Finally finishing up the series, the last 3 episodes of Cowboy Bebop really suprised me. All of characters finally confront their pasts, and finally go where their fates destined. When I watched the final Episode (The Real Folk Blues - Part 2) of Cowboy Bebop, I was suprised.. There was a nice twist at the end, finally finishing up the twists and turns of the whole series. There was nothing to be desired at the end, everything has closure (as so many films/movies don't have), yet is open for infinite possibilites. The whole series can be summarized in one word. ""Bang!"""
5,Real folk Blues,"While I am not stating anything that has not already been said, Cowboy Bebop is one the the funniest, most action packed, and one of the most intelligent shows out there. Its look is visually stunning, with it's gritty film noir like feel. It also has one of the best soundtracks ever, with Yoko Kanno's jazzy Tank! beginning each episode. And while the ending is a little sad, I don't believe it would have worked as well had it ended any other way.Bang!"
2,I'm Reviewing the Entire Series,"I am a fan of Anime in general and I found that I really wasn't taken with Cowboy Bebop. I found the plot and story lame and from episode to episode didn't really stick to the story as a whole unlike some of the others I've watched. I really didn't like any of the characters in it and to top it off the ending was so darn depressing. Now mind you I don't mind tragic endings, and that alone wouldn't have put me off. The problem is I found Bebop to be rather boring through most of the episodes and really only found a few that I enjoyed (the one about the mushrooms was good). In general though I really couldn't recommend this series. I would suggest renting it frist before deciding to buy."
3,Two outta four ain't bad,"The first two stories in this volume were great! As for the last two, well...I guess the project ran out of money or something. Can't win 'em all..."
1,Don't Do Anything,"I really have heard so many artists that try to sound and act hip, but really don't sound it because from the image. Britney Spears is really one of those artists. Yet, she has done some very poor songs, here latest one really doesn't rock at all. Do Somethin', the second track from her greatest hits record, My Perogative, really does lose it here. The song doesn't sound like a rock song at all. In fact, it sounds like Britney trying to rock out but not very well. The track doesn't even have the edge she has been trying to display. As for Britney, I just think she needs to find a better sound for herself.Song: F-"
1,im sorry but this song SUX!!! this is her worst single ever!,"britney spears will always be one of my favourite artist of all time regardless of the lack of effort in songs... especially on this single ""do something""....""do something"" IS one of her worst singles to date... she is riding off of the ""toxic"" beat and put really cheesy lackluster lyrics into the song....i understand that she has to experiment on songs or whatever but this experiment went wrong...and dont get me started on the video... she looks sooooo friggin terrible in the clip.... she is not dancing, her makeup is just horrible, and them flying around in a HUMMER!!!!! come on!!!!!if you are a britney fan and have never heard this song before.... be careful...."
1,"I'd Like to See Her ""Do Somethin'"" Like Retire","She can't sing, she's just a naive loser from some redneck town. If she's the Queen of Pop, then music has officially died. ""Do Somethin'"" is her latest piece of ""artwork"". Britney seems to be doing drugs."
3,small mouth bags,these were not the bags i was looking for unfortuanatly i am now stuck with 1000 bags to use up. the mouth of the bag is small so it is hard to put the popcorn in. oh well its popcorn so its still good.
5,excellent workout,This workout video really works. It really is a total body workout. I had the video for about eight years before it wore out from constant use! I tried to find it again in stores in the UK but had no success until I tried Amazon. I was so excited when i saw it online.
4,Awesome tale of survival,"Interesting character study of a man who's faced with the one thing he has wanted to get away from. Living alone in the mountains during a brutal, possibly deadly, blizzard is dangerous but when a stranger stranded outside in the horrible storm knocks on your door what do you do? Let an unwelcome stranger into your home or succumb to the brutal wilderness?"
3,Wsop,"The game itself is difficult, and if you want realistic difficult poker this is the game. There is no way to skip through the tournaments and they usually take like 1-2 hours to complete. The PSP game doesnt offer much customization as I hoped. And once you beat the one tournament (the main event) you basically are done. I played the main event and placed 130 in it, In order to compete in it again I had to create a new profile and new person. The presentation is nice and The WI-FI play lets you set up private custom games with your friends which is nice. Maybe the upcoming WPT game will be better. This one didnt strike gold but its worth a rent, and if your a hardcore poker player looking for some TOUGH training get this.3 stars for Presentation, On-line play, and very high difficulty.Mising Two stars becuase of Limited Customization, Long tournaments with no skipping through or re-competiting without developing a new profile, and Jesus Ferguson is almost impossible to out-compete."
1,crashes and bugs,The game keeps crashing (three times in the last hour);there are problems with the betting (small blinds in hold-em can check and get a card with no more money).
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I looked and looked for a poker game that had a feature where I could set up and play my favorite poker games without having to go through a story mode or career mode. This game has a career mode which I have not used. The reason I purchased this game was the quickplay option which allows me to set up my favorite games seven-card stud, pot limit omaha high, and no limit holdem. The AI's can be set to All Pros if you want a more challenging game. It is very fun. The format of these quickplay games are like a single table in a tournament though when your out you can't buy back in, but it is still fun.I really like this game and I don't know if there are any better PSP poker games where you can play AI's though."
4,Some tasty recipes here!,"O.K., It's a little dated but the food still taste great. Mr. Russo has convinced me that cigar smoking and good food go hand and hand together, this book proves it."
1,Cheap!!!!!,"I bought this lantern so when when our lights when out I would have something that was safe. Our lights went out last night and guess what, a couple of the batteries leaked and ruined the battery holder. I called United Marketing Group who sent it to me and they couldn't help me to see if I could order a replacement battery holder. Never got to use it. I bought two of them and now I will not keep the batteries in the other lantern until I need to use it. Very cheaply made. Very disappointed in this product. First time that I have ever got a product from Amazon that was not of good quality."
1,Not much light,The lantern does not give off enough light.Product is cheaply built.Remote stopped working.Would not buy again.Should not be branded by Jeep.
5,"An excellent, traditional story book...","This book contains many of the classic fairy tales, Cinderella, Thumbelina, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, etc. It is beautifully illustrated. I loved this book as a child and fortunately saved it for my own children who also love it. It is very unfortunate that Platt & Munk children's classics are no longer published in some form."
1,Makes bad cones (irregular),Makes very irregular waffles. Some parts are overbaked some underbaked.... :( We have tryed two samples of this product and both were the same :(((
5,A fun read and top pick,"Sometimes creativity running wild leads to trouble. Sometimes it leads to great things. Sometimes it leads to both. ""The Mad Scientists' Club"" is a collection of short stories collection from Boys' Life Magazine over forty years ago. Following a group of seven boys as they get their hands on technology and let their ideas run wild, they face their own trouble and save their town on multiple occasions. An anthology that will hold timeless and entertaining, ""The Mad Scientists' Club"" is a fun read and top pick."
5,A great series of books,"I remember reading these books when I was a kid. We picked up this one for our 8 year old son to read on our Kindle. Its one of the first times Ive actually seen his interest held by a book. These books open up a kids imagination because they incorporate some science, mystery, nature and other things that kids just dont do beyond what they are exposed to in school."
3,A classic,"I gave this book to my 7year old grandson, as he began reading chapter books, but I don't think he was quite ready for it. I read it first, of course, and I really loved it."
5,A GREAT WAY TO HELP KIDS GAIN VISION,"When I was a kid, I loved books that got me thinking how I could do fun projects or have fun adventures in my own life.THE MAD SCIENTIST'S CLUB is one of the best books to give kids vision of what they can accomplish, in a fun way.I spent time imagining what kinds of contraptions I could build, after reading this book.A must for any child who needs motivation.--George Stancliffe"
5,The Mad Scientists' Club,"This book and its sequel, ""The New Adventures of the Mad Scientists Club"", are 2 of the best children's books ever written. As a teacher, I am working on building units based on them. These books are fun, full of life, and full of knowledge too! I plan to use them as a jumping off point into all kinds of topics such as building sea monsters in class, balloons, first aid, and more. Read this book, it's fantastic!"
5,When I was a child,"I first owned the Mad Scientist Club through Scholastic Book Club. I think I was in the [...]and the book cost me $.35. Anyway, the book is good clean fun. There is nothing in the adventures of these young men that would embarass a parent. Actually, I always wanted to form my own chapter of the club. What they did seemed so much more interesting than holding a video game controller... which is what most kids are doing with their free time these days.Grahambo"
5,Just what he remembered.,My husband read these as a youngster. The books brought back some wonderful memories. Kids used to have just clean outdoor fun and adventures.
1,VERY disappointing for a Baby Einstein video,"I was really excited when I heard that a new Baby Einstein video was available. We have the whole series for our 15 month old son, who especially loves Baby Newton and Shakespeare. However, when we watched this video, I was really disappointed. It just wasn't as interesting and engaging as the other videos. My son usually will dance, clap, talk and point to the images on the TV and sing along with the children, but Baby Galileo didn't hold his attention at all. It didn't seem to have the imagination and creative oomph that the other videos in the series have. Something was definitely missing in this video and though I think Disney is ok, they seriously messed up the originality of Julie Aigner-Clark's vision."
1,Terribly disappointed,"It seems that now that Disney has a key role in it that everything in there videos becomes more of a marketing hype and less focus on education. I too have all the classics beginning with Baby Shakespeare (with the wonderful Blah sound from Bard the dragon ...)to Mozart, Van Gogh..... and was very disappointed when Disney took over because now I'm noticing even my son doesn't want to look at the newest and latest videos---he always goes back to the classics. ... I'm highly disappointed that Disney messed up a really good educational product. ..."
2,baby gallileo,Although i thought it was interesting it did not keep my nine month old's attention like the other baby einstein products do.
3,This is the only Baby Einstein video my son does not like!,"I thought that every one of the baby einstein videos would hold my 2 year old's interest but I was disappointed with this one. He has almost every other Baby Einstein video/DVD, and loves each one of them. But this one, for some reason, does not hold his interest. Perhaps some of the subject matter is just too advanced (or obscure) for him, I don't know."
5,My son's new favourite!,"My 18 month old son has loved Baby Einstein since it was introduced to us at the tender age of 6 months. Baby Galileo is his most recent addition to the DVD library and despite my initial impression he loves it. I personally felt that with chapters on the stars, planets and galaxy that it was just lots of objects spinning! He laughs at the puppets, follows the birds across the sky with the clouds, gets excited at the rocket and now we look through the bedroom curtains at the night sky as part of his bed time routine!"
2,Not Engaging,"My son is 15 months, and he loves many of the Baby Einstein DVDs. My husband and I thought this would be another hit and it wasn't. This is rather boring ... it doesn't have any of the ""zing"" that Baby Noah or Baby MacDonald has. Even Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart are better and these are far less glitzy productions. True, the subject matter of Galileo is a little bit more abstract, but I really feel it could have been done much better. We'll continue to try this to see if it is a matter of growing into it, but I'm not going to hold my breath."
1,Very disappointing!,"My daughter loves the Baby Einstein videos and we have most of them. I've always enjoyed watching them with her and feel that she's being exposed to music, animals, language, other children, etc in a creative manner suitable to her age group. However, this video doesn't hold my child's attention at all. I've tried to get her to give the video a chance because she's always pointing at the sun or the moon in the sky, but it doesn't interest her at all. The video seems extremely unimaginative, especially in comparison to the others we've seen. I watched the credits and it doesn't appear as if found Julie Aigner-Clark was involved in the making of this video and it certainly shows. Tossing in a few spinning stars and a puppet doesn't make this a video worthy of the Baby Einstein name. Might I suggest Neighborhood Animals or Baby Van Gogh instead?"
3,"We love baby einstein, but...","my kids just aren't into Baby Galileo. About halfway through the video they start squirming and whining. I'm not sure what they don't like about this one in particular, but it definitely does not hold their interest. Baby Van Gogh, Baby Monet and Baby Newton (discovering shapes) are much better options for keeping my kids entertained."
5,Daughter loves it...,"My daughter is about to turn three, and very interested in the moon and stars. I was worried that the video would be too young for her, but she loves it. Now she points to stars and asks if they are Venus, Mars, etc... and asks for the video by name. I wonder why they discontinued it?"
2,2 stars comparatively to other Einstein videos,"Although when you compare this video to the vast video selection out there, I would rate it higher, we've come to expect more from Einstein videos. It is unfortunate that Disney decided to change formats and puppets. Some of the footage of clouds and space are visually stimulating, but the video doesn't flow and lacks the personality that the other Einstein videos have in spades. I hope for the next production, they will go back to the old format, but if they do not, we will stop buying them."
1,Language not age appropriate,Not only is this the only BE dvd that can't holdmy daughter's attention but it 'wastes' vocabulary teaching time by teaching the names of all of the planets - which I don't think will be useful for most children.
2,the unfortunate future of Baby Einstein,"I was very worried when Disney bought out Baby Einstein. This DVD has a completely different feel than then the others and is the first one my son didn't really respond to. It's funny, the number of people and production companies listed in the credits is many times greater than on the 'real' Baby Einstein's but the quality is much worse. Too bad Pixar didn't buy them! A sad turn of events."
2,Too Fast For Comfort,"We have loved all the Baby Einstein products until now. This video strays away from the previous successful formula. The images change too fast. It couldn't hold my 3 year olds attention. I was shocked and sat down to watch it with him and quickly realized the images were changing at a much faster rate than the other previous releases. Before it would pause for much longer periods to let the child see and absorb what is being shown. With Galileo, you don't get as much chance to see before it goes on to the next scene. I was very disapointed and blame Disney. I hope they consider re-releasing it someday with the format adjusted."
5,One of the best,"This is our favorite one so far. It contains beautiful footage of skyscapes, planets and galaxies. It also has just the right mixture of puppets, toy footage, and children. If you like Baby Neptune, you should like this one too. My 5 mo. old loves it."
2,I've seen better!!,"My son has a ton of the baby einstein videos and this is the first one that did not keep his attention, i have tried over and over and Nicholas wants nothing to do with this video, i guess that's what happens when a huge company like disney gets involved...Thanks"
1,Not Amused,Our 7 month old son loves the Baby Einstein videos but this one didn't keep his attention. He loves to see puppets and kids but this DVD only has short segments with those. We are putting this one away for a few months to try it again later. It looks like to much Disney and not enough Einstein.
2,Disappointing,"We have several of the Baby Einstein DVD's and this is the only one my 14 mos. won't sit still for. About 10 minutes into it, she gets up to go play. When watching the others she is mezmerized. Definitely the least entertaining."
1,Such a letdown,"I, like so many others, thought FANTASTIC a new one! Boy, was it a huge disappointment. My son (12 months) actually started crying and was frightened in some of the fast-moving, flying saucering scenes. The flow was terrible and the puppets weren't even that entertaining. He absolutely loves the Baby Einstein series, but this latest attempt was a flop! It seemed entirely too contrived and forced and didn't feel the same as the previous ones. If this is what we are to expect for future additions, we won't be buying!"
5,Good one,"My 16 month old loves the Baby einstein dvd's, though i do believe this is his particular favorite. He liked Baby Galileo, the baby kangaroo. He's a big fan of the hand puppets."
3,Too Glossy,"I recently purchased this DVD for my 8 month old. He loves the other Baby Einstein titles, even those a little over his age level, so I thought I would get this one. As soon as I put it in, it was apparent that BE had gone commercial. Whereas the other titles have almost a ""homemade"" video feel to them, this one is obviously filmed like a studio movie. The pictures of cityscapes and sky look too professional and to me seem beautiful but boring. There are some pluses, the kangaroo puppets are delightful, and the classical music joined by a few children's favorites is still there, although the addition of a beloved Disney song is very noticable and out of place. This one is our least favorite of the bunch, with my son only turning to watch the puppetry. I hope the next one is better."
2,The Kangaroo has got to go!,"Really, the kangaroo puppets are a bit freaky looking and the lighted flying saucer looks like something out of the '70s! i kept looking over and over to be sure this was a new release---and scarily so, the graphics are pathetic for something done in 2003! (What happened to the awesome stuff used in Baby Neptune with FRIENDLY looking puppets and sweet children?!?!?) Is it more than a little strange how different in style and scale the BE dvds are? Also, a good bit of the music is just a repeat from prior baby einstein productions. a really lousy, low-budget looking film on the whole. I end this by saying what big fans we (vis a vis our toddler) are of baby einstein productions-particularly baby mozart, neptune and now baby beethoven. We will not give up on BE but will continue to view the new releases from netflix before buying."
1,Boring for baby,"I own all of the Baby Einstein DVDs and my daughter loves each one of them. She watches them three times a day (during mealtimes) and they keep her interest even after the many, many times she has seen them (she is twelve months old and has been watching them since she was three months old). Baby Galileo is very slow paced and my daughter will sit through it, but she does not enjoy it like she does the others. You should try other Baby Einstein DVDs first, especially Baby Mozart. But if you really want to buy a DVD your baby will love, get some Bear in the Big Blue House DVDs. How educational!"
4,We like it!,"Our baby (aged 5 months) really likes this one. I think the puppets are cute and some of the video sequences are really beautiful (like the clouds). The music is all classical music that has a moon, planet, or space theme (e.g. Clair de Lune by Debussy). Some of the other reviewers are disappointed because this doesn't seem to be much like the others in the series (which I don't have much experience with), but if your baby likes it that's what counts. And who can predict what one baby will find fascinating and another dull?"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Like most Baby Einstein enthusiasts, I ran out and bought the newest thinking it would be as spectacular as the rest. WRONG!My daughter barely made it through the opening. She didn't want to have anything to do with it. She walked away! The whole feel and look of the video was different. It almost didn't even seem like a Baby Einstein video! One of the things that drew me to the collection in the first place was the ""real world"" feeling that the videos offered. But this one was all fluff. It seriously missed the mark.This was"
4,Our son's second favorite,"Next to Baby Neptune, this is our 16-month-old son's favorite Baby Einstein video. He has already learned to say ""moon"" and ""sky"" from watching it. Love the music, especially the ""moon"" section, so much that I just bought the Baby Galileo CD for the car. Some of the footage they picked to go along with the ""planets"" sequence could be considered a stretch... what do bubbles have to do with Pluto? My kid thinks the part where the mouse eats the moon-made-of-cheese is hilarious. The scene for one of the planets where the little ball rolls down the long back-and-forth ramp and out the hole at the bottom, while the boy giggles and points, seems to have been put in there as a joke for the parents--we suspect the Baby Einstein people are trying to say that food goes through your intestines and then out Uranus!"
3,A little slow,"This one might be good for before bedtime as the music and scenes are sometimes pretty slow. Not my son's favorite, but still worth having."
2,Highly Disappointing,"We have the entire Einstein collection and were very excited to see the new one. First of all, one of my child's favorite part is the little caterpillar that comes out at the beginning of the video-missing from the new Galileo! They used different puppets rather than hand held and it just wasn't the same quality. Whereas my baby sits virtually hypnotized by the other videos, he is not impressed with this one at all, he's bored after about 15 minutes. I was planning on picking up Newton but I think I'm going to wait and see what other parents comment first."
2,You can tell Disney did this one,"We have ALL of the Baby Einstein videos. I love the line, but this one isn't up to par with the others. Baby Galileo doesn't hold her attention like the others. It's too computerized and not enough sketches with children."
1,Agree! Very disappointing.,"Our 1-year-old son has 6 of the Baby Einstein DVDs. He usually loves watching them, but for this one, he (and we) do not enjoy it at all. It feels like virtually every item they show on the screen is spinning. He gets very restless and we understand why. If you want a DVD to make you feel dizzy, buy this one. If you would prefer to better spend your money, buy Baby Mozart or Baby Neptune."
2,Flat,I was disappointed with this Disney-ised edition of Julie Clark's videos. The puppets looked flat and didn't relate with my baby at all. The entire video looked too orchestrated and doesn't have the personal feel of the old 'from my household to yours...' My baby didn't seem to mind; she just turned away to do more interesting things. I was disappointed.
4,"Good, but Where's Julie Clark??","Compared to other baby videos on the market -- so smart, baby genius, baby babble, etc. (we've got a lot of them!) -- this is a video of obviously superior production quality. However, if you read the credits, Julie Clark had nothing to do with making this one. There are certain, subtle things that Disney does and does not do that make this lack the charm of the older BE videos. For example, transitions from image to image are not phrased to the music and are random. And in the video shots of mobiles, the camera is also rotating, which ruins the simplicity and pleasant effect of watching the mobile. That being said, we still really like the video. It has great shots of stars and planets, and is relaxing to watch in the evening."
2,Bad Encription!! Try VHS?!,"We have several of the Baby Enistien titles on both DVD and VHS. Our three children love them. We recieved a copy of Baby Galileo on DVD for christmas. The movie is cute but the video encription must be off. The motion of the toys and puppets is jerky and kind of nausating to watch. None of our other titles have this problem. This was a 2003 release maybe someone at disney will get hip and fix it. Cute video, dont like to watch it a lot."
1,VERY disappointing,"I was (and I think I can say the same for my 17 month old daughter) VERY disappointed in this DVD. I was excited about playing this for her because she absolutely loves all the other Baby Einstein videos (even Baby Neptune, which is the first Disney made video). My daughter lost interest in this after the first two minutes. I kept watching it, hoping it would get better so I could draw her attention to it, but it was just painful. If your child somewhat loses interest in the other BE videos during the ""downtime"" (ie, slow music), do NOT purchase this video. The entire DVD is full of the slow, downtime music. I wish I could return it and get my money back. I will second-guess buying any more Disney made BE videos."
1,stick with the earlier baby einstein videos,"My daughter absolutely loves the Baby Einstein video series, but not Baby Galileo. Hand puppets have been replaced by choppy computer animated puppets which are not visually appealing at all. Musical selections are a bore as well since they're repeats from older videos..."
2,Not Their Best,"As the mother of a wonderful 10 month old baby girl, I can say that we both love the Baby Einstein line of books and videos. Baby Galileo looked promising. After several viewings, however, my daughter resorted to pulling all of the magazines off of the coffee table for the millionth time which proved to be much more stimulating. Try Language Nursery of World of Animals. They truly capture her imagination as do the books Neighborhood Animals, Cats, and Babies."
3,not the best,"My daughter (2years old) has always been a huge fan of the baby einstein videos ever since she was a colicky baby (it was probably the only 45 minutes of no crying we got!). She loves the sky and objects in the sky so i was excited to see this video when it came out, figuring it would be by far her favorite. Personally it was a disappointment. Some of the music as well as some of the toys are repeats from other einstein videos. The main character puppets used in this video are not like the usual ones either, not as cute. My daughter watched maybe 10 minutes of it and left the room, a FIRST for these videos. definitely not a favorite in this household."
1,"Awful with a capital ""A""","What happened to the beauty of the original Baby Einstein series?? What happened to Julie Clark?? This video is boring, slow paced and completely unimpressive. My baby wouldn't watch it for more than a minute. Buy the original Einstein videos, but stay away from this one."
4,My daughter enjoys this DVD,"I agree with other reviewers that this DVD is different from the rest of the series, but my 3 month old daughter finds it fascinating. Yes, she is younger than the recommmended age, but the beauty of the Einstein videos is that they work on many levels for different ages. I like the fact that they have combined real-life photos and toys that fall under the same theme. This helps children to categorize various objects into like subjects. This requires parents to take a more active role in explaining to the child what is happening.After reading reviews for many of the Baby Einstein DVDs, I have come to the conclusion that you have to figure out which ones work best for you and your child. You'll love some, you'll be using others as coasters, it varies as much as children and their tastes do."
3,Only three stars for this Baby Einstein about the stars,"Unlike the other Baby Einstein videos in the series, this one lacks the ""pizzaz"" that the previous ones did. The images weren't as captivating and my 1 1/2 year old actually made me turn it off the first time we watched it. We've tried to watch it a few more times but she just does not like it as much as the others from the series. Choose others from the Baby Einstein series if you're looking for something your kid will love immediately and rent this one."
2,Not as good as the rest,"My daughter only pays attention for the first half of the video. With all the other Baby Einstien videos she watches the entire thing - over and over (if I let her.) I'm not sure what is different, but the same appeal isn't there. Although, I got a refresher course in the order of the planets :)"
4,Mom of an almost 2-year-old,My son is 21-months-old and absolutely loves this DVD. We have almost all of the videos in this series. I agree that it is quite different from the older Baby Einstein videos.I didn't really like the puppets in Baby Galileo as much as I did in the older videos and much of the music is the same which was disappointing. The puppets aren't as friendly looking or interactive as in previous videos.The pictures are incredible though. I have been using the DVD to help teach my son new words and colors which is working nicely since he loves watching it.
2,It's TERRIBLE and very cheaply made,"This does not engage my 9-month-old at all, who loves the Baby Einstein ""Old MacDonald"" and ""Neighborhood Animals"" and used to love all Bach, Beethovens, and Mozarts. These dvds are the only thing that will actually keep her still when eating or when it's time to calm down before nap and bed. I was excited to introduce her to a new concept and this movie is just horrible. It is very cheaply made and it keeps showing the same garden twirling star toy over and over again. You would really think they would find more creative toys to put into the video.So why 2 stars and not 1? I do like that the planets are named and footage of the real planets are shown as well as the stars. But other than that, it is just terrible and not a learning experience nor a tool for me to begin her quiet time."
2,boring for one year old,"My one year old son loves all of the baby einstein dvd's except for Baby Mozart(which was his all time favorite in infancy)and Baby Einstein which are too slow for him now.I was excited when Baby Galileo came out but we both were bored by it. There are not enough puppets, they keep repeating the same toys (maybe because they couldn't find enough in the categories)and perhaps for his age, he's just not interested inlooking at real white speckled stars in the nite sky. Maybe when he's a bit older, we'll try it again.Although, he did get to see images of the sun, stars, moon, clouds, planets and galaxies. The space segment was the best with robots and rocket ships. I noticed in the credits that there are so many people involved now yet Baby Galileo seemed very thin."
2,Boring for my 14-month old,"We have the Baby Einstein - World Animals DVD and my 14-month old absolutely LOVES that one. I ran out and bought this one thinking it would have more ""action"" and puppet skits. Instead, it just shows pictures of the sky. My son was bored after the first 10 minutes of this and started playing elsewhere. Nothing about this video captured his attention, except for the occasional baby and puppet.I would not recommend this edition for active babies."
1,A very poor attempt.,"This is a completely failed attempt at creating a film about Bix Beiderbecke that even remotely touches on the real facts of his life - which are actually much more interesting than anything this film has to offer.Some of the music is excellent but it is a recreation; nothing of the real Bix can be heard.Finally, the actors do not look like the characters they are supposed to represent, least of all the guy playing Bix who does not resemble him whatsoever.If you want to learn about the real Bix - then better not waste your money on this."
4,"It's a big chicken, but don't be afraid.","I bet they would be a fun band to see live. This is their first release I think. It is really good: Kind of jam-jazz without a lot of vocals. The songs progress and go somewhere. bass, guitar, sax, organ, drums and wonderful groove weirdness...This cd and the following one (In Search Of...) are both very good. As good IMO as much more well known bands that could possibly be considered musical cousins of TTC such as Soulive or New Mastersounds or others carrying on the torch of funkysoulgroove in their own way. On a side note: for fans of the Prog Rock band Yes, TTC's sax player has a CD of Yes covers with baritone, alto, tenor and soprano sax arrangements that is done really well and does the songs justice while presenting them in a new way. KFC no....TTC yes!"
5,Gorgeous Watch,"I picked this watch as a birthday present, and absolutely love it. It is so beautiful. Also, the clasp on the watch is a ""push-button-clasp"" which I hadn't seen before, but seems to be working just fine. I am extremely happy with my purchase."
5,more beautiful than the pics,"I purchased this watch as a gift and she loves it. It looks even better in real life than it does in the pictures. The craftmanship is outstanding...smooth bracelet portion, sparkling diamonds and a nice weight/feel to it without being too heavy. I did, however, shop around for the best price and found it under $525. It goes from being worn daytime to going out for a nice evening...versatile. I don't regret buying this watch!! If you like a classic look with quality then you will enjoy this watch that has class and a little bling to it too. This watch looks really good on a wrist about 7"". The face is not especially large or sporty."
5,Only the Best!,"Volume 13 of Cowboy bebop is as my title says the best.I was swept away after seeing it for the first time. It's one of those episodes that make you think. Especially the last one. All the action and violence you crave in an episode. After I saw it for the first time, I thought, ""watch it again!"" Unfortunately, I don't have it. It ain't easy to find out there, especially during Christmastime. But, this video, without a doubt, is one to see."
2,I was terribly dissapointed!,"I waited and waited for these two episodes to come out since I just couldn't get enough of Cowboy Bebop. After this poor excuse of an ending came on Adult Swim that night, I wanted to mail a bomb to Japan! When Edward and Ein left the Bebop crew for good, the rest of the series episodes began going down in flames. Bad move right there. Sappy love stories and cliche rivalies between former friends has given this series a bad name. Hello people! This was suposed to be about bounty hunters that face action adventure and mayhem all the way through! In fact these are the same mistakes that most anime shows make. I only gave this two stars instead of one since it had some readical action in it."
1,"If an author doesn't have credibility, he doesn't have anything","I picked up my copy if The War Path at my library's book sale last week. At the time the name ""David Irving"" didn't ring a bill - that happened after I was home unpacking my acquisitions.When I began thumbing through the book I found some interesting looking trivia, but in light of some astonishing omissions and the 'prettifying' of many of Hitler early deeds, I decided I'd be a fool to waste my time reading an author I didn't trust.The War Path will go into the paper recycling box as soon as this review is finished. Hopefully it'll be reincarnated into something useful - perhaps a solid and reliable cardboard box."
4,Perfect He's Not,"this is an interesting read, but if i had my ""druthers"", i would have preferred it if DW had left out the early chapters describing his youth, minor league experiences, etc. its important to remember that this is not social commentary, its a behind the scenes book about baseball - written by, arguably, the most colorful individual on the diamond today. if you like books that explore the ""wild side"" of sports life, you won't be disappointed here. if your after one that chronicles the day to day grind of an average ballplayer, replete with all the detail - this one isn't for you. also, this isn't a ""yankee"" book, so if you're a ""pinstripe"" hater you'll enjoy it too. don't expect much more than the meandering recollections of one of baseball's throwback heroes. you'll also learn that, despite the publicity that depicts wells as a party animal supremo, he is also a disciplined competitor who has endured his share of pain and hard work."
2,Why a book?,"Other than to satisfy some need for self-gratification, why was this book written? At best David Wells is an above average pitcher with some moments of brilliance with what was otherwise mediocre pitching ability.He's not Gibson, Carlton, Seaver or even Jerry Koosman. These are pitchers who won on the basis of their abilities to throw full, consistent games. Wells had the good fortune to be in lineups that could stake him 3-4-5 runs a game. How can you not win with O'Neil or Jeter on your team?Maybe he expected we'd be enthralled by his behavior or exposes of player behavior. The original, Ball Four does it better. His antics pale next to the original, Mantle, Maris and Martin.Save yourself the money, borrow it at the library."
2,Going to the Wells once too often,"This book represents all that is wrong with the New York Yankees and all that is wrong with baseball. Pure egotistical drivel by an ignorant man. Literary gruel that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. As a palate cleanser, read THE LITTLE RED SOX BOOK by Bill ""Spaceman"" Lee, the antithesis of Yankeeism, and a man who reflects and embodies the pure joy of baseball. A ton of laughs( like having Babe Ruth stay in Boston and Ted Williams killing Hitler with a line drive!!) for those who can read and chew gum at the same time.Fred in Boston"
5,A MUST READ IF YOU ARE A BASEBALL FAN,"I have been a baseball fan for more than 30 years and this is one of the best ball game books I have read. It reminds me very much of the book ""ball four"". This book is fun to read, very illustrative about the good and the bad aspects of baseball in the last 20 years. David Wells really ""tells it like it is"". This book is real. I am really tired of phony writers.I can tell when someone wrote a book with the only objective of selling many copies. The recent book about Paul O`Niell is doing great; But, is not really about baseball."
3,Good book,"Not a bad book. All the hype was a little too much. Lives a crazy life. As for the Red Sox fan before, stop your bull. The curse lives on beanhead."
4,Really fun,"liked it a lot - very funny and a lot of good baseball stuff about the Yankees, and about what it's like to live as a major leaguer."
4,"Funny, Witty, and Insightful","A VERY funny, witty, and insightful book by one of the game's true characters. Some of the stories in this book will stick with you for life. His relationship with Davey Johnson was tumultuous to say the least. The head butting story almost made me spit up I was laughing so hard. His account of the night before he threw his perfect game is one for the ages."
3,Not as smooth as I expected,"This was the first time I splurged on a high threadcount sheet set and I was a little disappointed at the result. I've slept on other peoples' 400- and 450-count sheets and found them to be BETTER than this set of 500-count sheets. You can tell that these sheets have a tight weave, but it feels a little scratchy, even after two washings. The sateen finish just doesn't feel like it is there or it is doing any good. I wouldn't buy another set."
3,Pros and cons on sheets,"I'm very happy with the softness and comfort of these sheets, but they look very wrinkled. I'm not sure if this is normal for high thread count sheets, but I'm not crazy about the wrinkled look."
1,Scented: Bad - Unscented: OK,"The litter is hard clumping and I like it for that. But I agree that the perfumed litter is horrid, nasty stuff. I didn't have dust problems, but my cat seemed to absorb the perfume through his feet. His fur reeked of the ""Fresh"" scent and my hands did, too, every time I petted him. Before long, the entire house smelled of cheap perfume from this litter.I switched to Unscented and am much happier. I have to believe my cat is, too."
5,One of the best plush bald eagles I've seen,"My friend got me this eagle as a gift and I love it! The eagle is a good size, and of good quality. Details, like the scaly-looking (but soft) material used for his beak and feet, make him look realistic. His legs are also stiff enough for him to stand on his own. He has a very nice expression in his face too. If you're looking for a stuffed eagle, I highly recommend this one."
3,"Good Ideas, but not too much help","It shows a lot of different techniques to excite you lover, but I found that I had already tried most of them, and some of the ones that I hadn't were pretty off the wall."
4,Swiss Army watch,"It has a simple beauty I like the style of the whole piece on the wrist.An inconvenience: depends on the ambient light, the numbers, too brilliant, are not visible sometimes and you have to move your hand to see the time."
2,not what advertised,Book was a disappointment as it was very dirty and we did not feel was worth even looking through the book. Seller misinformed.
2,"Dated material, old drawings, unclear illustrations","An historical review, not a great book. Not awful either, but closer to never being looked at once its glanced through.Drawings and methods of things never used any more make this an history book, rather than a textbook."
1,Too mcuh details with not much of rudimentary section,Almost all books on electricity first start with the concept of electrons (electrons circulating around an atom or was it vise-versa?). I find remote relationship between the theory and practicality in this subject.This book is written in microscopic letters (probably the font size 1 to 2 on MS-Word?).I wonder if I am the only one in the world who's needing a book that I can apply to practicality.
5,Get the other Electronics books too !,"I'm an ex submariner and a former 1st class Electronics technician. I went through both ET ""A"" and ET ""B"" school at the Naval training center at the Great Lakes base in Illinois. If you want to study and learn Electronics there are 3 books you need...this one Basic electricity ( you need to master this before you study the next 2 books which are ""Basic electronics"" ( this is virtually the identical material used in the Navy's 38 week ET ""A"" School and then the ""Advanced electronics ""book ( this one is the ET ""B"" school curriculum) I believe all 3 are available here at Amazon. The Navy did an incredibly good job with this material as it's core of their electronics schools which by the way, were taught by civilian electrical engineers from the staff of the university of Chicago's electrical engineering dept.If you can master the material in these books you could easily stand toe to toe with any Electronics engineering college graduate anywhere"
3,Easy to read bad translation,"I would only recommend this if you have trouble reading other translations. Overall I like it, but because its a 'thought-for-thought translation they added alot of personal interpretation.Two examples I found were, in Job the Behemoth is translated Hippopotamus, although that has been the traditional interpretation, the behemoth may have even been a dinosaur because the Bible says the behemoth 'carries its tail like a cedar'. In the New Testament the NLT translators had the assumption that Leviticus 11 food rules (kosher) don't apply to Christians. Did your physical body change when you became a Christian? If the Bible says its unhealty to eat pork or shellfish, then that applies to everyone, even an Atheist."
4,Owls Well,"Donna Andrews' Owls Well That Ends Well is a pratfall of a novel. That's not to say that it isn't entertaining - on the contrary, it's very amusing - but the antics of Meg Langslow's suspect pool reached new heights. As part of the buyer's agreement for their new house, Michael and Meg organize a large yard sale to unburden themselves of the previous owner's goods, while generating a small profit for the deceased's family. On the day the 30-family yard sale opens up a local scalawag/antiques dealer is murdered in Meg's barn, and everything goes downhill from there. As a police investigation goes underway on one side, a carnival springs up on Meg and Michael's front lawn, with suspects darting to and fro. In the end it all adds to the charm and chuckles, and the Meg Langslow books continue to be an endearing series."
4,Fun mystery to read,This is the first Donna Andrews mystery I have read. I found it entertaining and easy to read. I enjoyed the absence coarse profanity. Other reviews indicated this was one of her weaker installments so since I enjoyed this book I am anxious to read her other 'better' books.
4,Donna Andrews does it again,The Meg Langslow series is a wonderful thing. The cast of wacky characters in this book is just as great as always. A must read for murder mystery fans with a funny bone!!!!
4,A good solid read,"Meg Lanslow and he boyfriend have purchased the old Sprocket farmhouse (last seen in Crouching Buzzard, Leaping Loon) at a bargain price. The one catch, they have to clear out all of the junk the former owner left behind, and give her heirs 10% of any profits. Meg decides a yard sale is the most expedient way to get rid of the extra junk, and just can't say no when her relatives and Michael's college co-workers decide they are going to get into the action for a 17 family yard sale. With the house falling to pieces under her feet, hordes of yard sale goers stalking the house at all hours of the day and night, dozens of relative cluttering the house, and Sprockets haunting the sale looking for their 10% fee, a murder in the barn is the last thing on Meg's wish list. Funny, warm, and engaging. I can't wait for the next book in August 2006."
1,First Meg book I couldn't finish,"Oh, Donna, how could you? Into the book by about 1/3 and I kept thinking, ""When is this thing going to get going? The corpse has been found and I'm bored.""Seriously, I've enjoyed Meg Langslow and looked forward to this, her latest adventure. I know others have called it entertaining. I just can't agree.The plot, what there is of it, moves so slowly and never seems to come together with any kind of page-turning interest.Sorry, but this was very inferior to her previous books."
2,I expected so much more,"I love this series but this installment was just so ho-hum! Nothing original, nothing new, and nothing to write home about. I was so dissapointed because when Donna Andrews burst onto the scene her writing was fresh, funny and fabulous. But apparently she's lost staying power. This was flat, by-rote, and boring. The only positive thing I can say is that it is MILES better than Access Denied, her last hardcover in another series."
4,Entertaining,"Now the mother of twin boys, murder continues to find Meg and this time it includes an assortment of animals losing their home and local political mayhem. The situations that arise with Meg's and her quirky and eccentric family kept me entertained in this light-hearted mystery. This was an enjoyable read."
3,Owl's So-So,"There's no doubt that Donna Andrews is a talented writer. I did enjoy this book -- the third in her Meg Langslow mystery series. There were several bright points that made me smile, but I did not get the ""laugh a page"" that the cover blurbs promised.Andrews' ability to craft language and to create unique scenarios will win her a place on my shelf, but there were some problems with this book. The characters were not introduced sufficiently to win over new readers. What does Meg look like? How old is she? We are TOLD that her family is crazy, but I want to SEE that more.I felt too much like I was coming in on Act II of the play, and felt left out of the jokes. Yes, I did skip books 1 and 2, but new readers to a series should always feel welcome, not as if they're intruders."
5,Cheerful... humorous... deft touch...,"Owls Well that Ends Well is a cheerful mystery story written with a deft touch. Meg Landslow, the lead character, is a strong, competent, pragmatic soul. She is fiercely loyal to her significant other, Michael, and is surrounded by eccentric relatives and town characters.The plot and characterizations are hilarious. The background for this story is Meg's organization of a giant yard sale, which provides for many comedic opportunities, including unscrupulous antique dealers, combative curio seekers, helpful and not so helpful helpers, and more."
4,Second best in the series,"I really loved the first book in the series, Murder with Peacocks, and thought the next ones were fine, but not up to the standard of the first one. There was something about the breakneck pacing of Murder with Peacocks that kept me reading, plus I enjoyed the unuusual treatment of the wedding theme. And the situation with Meg's love life is hiliarious. In this book, I think the author has returned to the strengths of the first one. Meg is more like the person I met in the first book. I really enjoyed the yard sale theme, the crazy and unusual relatives, and most of all, how Meg manages the family and the mystery solution with such creativity. Much more captivating than the recent offerings, and I hope for more like this one."
5,Size of cutter,"Very good cutter but it was advertised as a 4"" cutter. The grip is 4"". The cut is 3 1/4"". I wanted a 4"" cut! Got it from Amazon in 2 days with no shipping charge - terrific!!!!!"
2,Misleading,"I purchased this cookie-cutter because of its four-inch diameter size. However, when I received the order I found that the four-inch diameter is at the top of the cookie-cutter and not the actual cutting diameter. So if you're considering purchasing this is not a four-inch cutting diameter."
4,Comfort Grip Cookie Cutter,This cookie cutter is easy on the hands and cuts through dough easily. The downside is that it takes up a lot of room compared to stacking cookie cutters. But if I need a 3.5 inch cookie cutter...this is the one I reach for.
1,Product dimensions are not accurate and not thorough,"I gave this the lowest rating becaue the actual product is 3 3/4"" diameter on the outside of the grip and 3 1/2"" or a little less on the outside diamter of the cutter blade. Product dimensions in ad state it is 4"" wide. I wanted a cutter closer to 4"" to make a hand pie and this isn't it. I ordered an Ateco 4"" cutter and I'll see which cutter is closest when the Ateco arrives. Wilton cutter is decent quality and if I have to, I will pass it on to a devoted baker."
5,"LOTS of long-lasting bubbles, pleasant fragrance","If you read the label on most commercial ""children's"" bubble bath products, you'll find the warning, ""prolonged use may lead to urinary tract infection."" As soon as I realized this, I started searching for a quality natural bubble bath product for my kids. I've tried California Baby, which smells nice but you have to use quite a bit to get any bubbles, and the bubbles don't last long. The Earth Friendly Baby bubble bath smells great and a little goes a long way - pour in a little as you start filling the bathtub, agitate the water with your hand, and you'll get LOTS of bubbles that last through the entire bath. My search ends here!"
1,bad Toaster,"I bought this toaster and found out that regular slices of bread do not fit in the slots. I have to cut off 1/2"" off the side of the bread for it to fit. I am talking about breads like orowheat and pepperidge farm. Bad bad toaster.."
4,An Excellent Overview of Spectroscopy for Undergrads & Grads,"Harris and Bertolucci have written an excellent overview of general spectroscopy theory, appropriate for both undergraduate and graduate students. As a chemist, I found it very helpful as I took introductory quantum mechanics in graduate school and later used it as a practical guide to interpreting and understanding infrared spectra as a graduate student.For the price, this is one of the best bargains available to students. Consider other Dover publications for great prices as well."
4,loved this book,"I used this book to supplement my molecular spec. course many years ago. As others have noted - very friendly in its tone.For other classic books in this area look at:1. Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy by Gordon M. Barrow, McGraw-Hill, 1962 (You should avoid his more commonly found book with a similar title: The Structure of Molecules: An Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy, published by W. A. Benjamin, 1964. This book is too basic.)2. Introduction to Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy by William A. Guillory, Allyn and Bacon, 1977Check out my other reviews for other chem books."
3,A good start.,"This book is a good start for martial artists who want to learn more about 'how to train'. At slightly over 100 pages, it's a fast read and broaches most of the questions required in the development of training programs. The downside is the book seems to be based more on personal experience rather than research. In some cases, the research has gone beyond the book's information. In a few cases, the research contradicts the book. Still, it is a good book to begin with and then, if still interested, the reader can move on to more rigorous material."
1,This sucked total balls,"I've seen some pretty horrible movies in my time.. And this movie left me speechless. I didn't realize navy seals used walkie talkies and head sets and that they had infinite ammo. Not to mentiont he lack of acting ability was astonishing even to the most cretenistic mind. Take my advice, Go buy Saving Private Ryan."
2,Hand Held Can Opener,It was a Christmas gift for my wife she loved it until she tryed to use it for Christmas dinner. She plugged it in and the didn't work! All it did was hum didn't move anything! She says it has an 800 number so she did or is going to call them. Myself it's a piece of garbage since it was made in China. I just that the good old U.S.A. start making products here instead of over in the asian countries. What happen to U.S. products and supporting the U.S. workers.
3,Cute..but velcro stinks!,"I bought these for my 3 year old hoping I didn't have to help her with her shoes as much...She could get them on, but the one strap has to be pulled through a very tight leather hole then attached to velcro. The elastic strap doesn't have enough resistance to keep the shoes tight first of all...secondly the velcro the strap attaches to doesn't have a real ""stick to"" factor. Overall they are holding up well..though she fell several times the first day of wear and scuffed the top of the toes!:)"
4,Semi - Auto marker,"This is one of the most complete basic markers on the market, the only problem is the absense of rail to set a gun sight and the aiming in general. For other side is lightweight an made of titanium.EDGAR CASTROCCS-VEN"
3,Not That Impresive,This video card is very noisy and heavy but is fast. It setup easily and ran fine for a few weeks but then I started getting problems when running 3D games. The screen would go all bizarr with lines and blocks. But windows would run fine. Anyway I got a Radoen X1600XT and that card ran all my games just as good as the X1900XTX. So is it worth the extra $$ for this Card. I dont think so.
5,A classic of its kind,David Douglas Duncan is known for his war photography but this passionately photographed book 'Sunflowers For Van Gogh' shows a very different side to the man. Using regular drug store film he photographed sunflowers all over France during a very hot summer. The result is a beautiful collection of images photographed in many different and remote locations with these amazing flowers dominating each page.And the special attraction in this book is that all Van Gogh's paintings of sunflowers are reproduced here though during his life time the sunflower was very rare. This historical contrast brings a special significance to this amazing book and it has always had a special significance in my photographic collection.One of my all time favourites.Bruce Hart
3,If you Like This Book...,"If you like Matt Kent's work, see the Weird New Jersey special issue recently released called ""Nightshade on the Passaic."" It is written by this same author and gives insight into abndoned structures and other features found along the banks of the Passaic River in New Jersey. [...]"
2,"At times insightful, at times self-indulgent","This book is a must-read for parents of angry teenagers. Matt Kent perfectly vocalizes the thoughts of suburban angst-ridden kids, lashing out against everything and anyone. At times insightful, at times self-indulgent, the book is a fantastic window into the mind of affluent, frustrated suburban youth.Kent was arrested for what he wrote on his website. An unfortunate mistake on the behalf of the authorities, since the arrest only gave Kent more fuel for his hatred. The arrest made this book possible, so the police really only succeeded in spreading Matt Kent's words to an even wider audience.I'm not going to say this book is well-written--Matt Kent is very much obsessed with himself and his own self-satisfied righteous anger--but it provides an important perspective on how spoiled, frustrated youth are dealing with their affluence and priviledge."
1,Written by a Raving Lunatic,"This book is written by a raving lunatic, it is no surprised that this Matt Kent obsesses over ""abandoned asylums"" in his websites. It's wackos like this that have caused such destruction in our country. Please do not support a nutcase, otherwise you're be fueling the hatred and ignorance."
5,Biology and the Living Environment,"The book has a good coverage of the following areas:o Unity and Diversity Among Living Thingso Maintenance of Living Thingso Human Physiologyo Reproduction, Development and Geneticso Evolutiono Ecology and the Biosphereo Review of Lab Skillso Extensive GlossaryThe book would be useful for students preparing for theNYS Regents in Living Environment. A companion bookwould be Let's Review Biology-4th Edition-Barron's SeriesSample diagrams in Chapter 1 of Concepts in Modern Biologyare as follows:o Life processes (nutrition, transport, respiration etc.)o Euglenao Prokaryoteso shapes of bacteriao viral structures (DNA , protein coat, tail)o Tracheophytes and their structureso Dicots and Monocotso planariao annelidso molluskso arachnidso echinodermso Orders of MammaliaThe book would be a good preparation for high schoolstudents bound for college. The acquisition is pricedreasonably at $50 or so. Many used copies are available."
4,Great Off Road video,"This is actually two disks, with the first disk covering racing coverage from the late '90s up through about 2003, the second bridges the gap to more recent times. It was fun to see some of the older bikes that many of us still ride out there gettin' it done. Or in many cases not getting anything done. The disks are broken down by type of terrain such as hills, mud, starting lines, etc... These are age appropriate for any age rider. The price is a great deal also. These are much more expensive to buy straight from the distributer. The set came within a week. Bottom line, if you enjoy offroad motorcycle racing in the woods type environment, then this is for you."
4,Insight to Pakistan,"I received this book for my birthday from my friend. I have a great interest in Pakistani and Indian culture, so this was a great gift. The book contains 12 short stories written by women including Farkhanda Lodhi, Umme Amara, Razia Fasih Ahmed, Khalida Husain, and Mumtaz Shirin. Many of the stories deal with Partition and its aftermath. I enjoyed some stories better than others. My favorites included ""Parbati"" by Farkhanda Lodhi, which told the story of a woman crossing the border during war. ""Godfather"" by Khadija Mastoor was also striking. This story was about a woman hardened and living a harsh life. Exile by Jamila Hashmi tells the tale of a woman who is brutally seperated from her family during Partition. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about what it could be like to be a woman in Pakistan."
3,Worth the extra money?,"This review is based on the extras you get over the silver White Pony and not so much the album itself, because the album itself is really quite an achievement and worth more than 3 stars. Really this CD is the silver version plus an extra track, The Boy's Republic. This track keeps the moody atmosphere the album creates, but I can kind of see why it was left off the proper album. The songwriting isn't as strong as on the other tunes and thus sounds kinda sloppy. If you absolutely MUST hear every single song the Deftones have written then by all means pick up this CD. If you're just a casual fan then I would recommend picking up the less expensive silver version of White Pony instead. But no matter what it is essential to pick up either/or, because the first 11 tracks are really a work of art, and it would be a shame to miss them."
5,"""Don't let me go take me to the edge""","The Deftones have come a long way with their music; it ranges from screeching to more melodic vocals. Their new cd entitled the White Pony is amazing, to say the least. A differnet path was taken on the cd, and the Deftones have proven that they are incredibly talented. They not only wrote amazing lyrics; such as the song ELITE-""When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control"", but Chino used the full extent of his voice, which is just simply angelic in the song TEENAGER. They seemed to be more open then on either of the other cd's which might upset some fans, since they are used to the screaming and more hardcore sound they have once emmitted, but I believe that if one is tuely a deftones fan, he or she will appreciate the new cd for its content and experimental, more poetic music style."
5,THE BEST YET,"I BOUGHT THIS CD ONLY KNOWING ONE SONG OFF OF IT ""CHANGE(IN THE HOUSE OF FLIES)"". I LOVED THE SONG AND WAS NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN BUYING IT.WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO IT I LOVED IT. IT WAS BETTER THEN ""AROUND THE FUR"". IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE BONUS TRACK. THE BONUS TRACK ""THE BOYS REPUBLIC"" IS A GREAT ENDING TO A GREAT CD. ALSO THE SONG ""PASSENGER"" FEATURES MAYNARD JAMES KEENAN OF TOOL/A PERFECT CIRCLE. YOU SHOULD DEFINITLY BUY THIS CD."
4,deftones still try,"this album was a strong attempt at putting the soul and sound back into their music, but on tracks like 1 and 5, you can still feel the group struggle with themselves"
5,BUY THIS,"when i fisrt bought this i new it was worth it cause deftones dont dissaponit, but any way, that 12 extra song is really really really good, so just spend the extra 2 or 3 bucks and buy it, also check on stitch. they were suppose to be at ozzfest check that out"
4,sweet cd,"this cd was a good one, its kinda like they other stuff but has a little twist to it and so i think. but maybe thats just me"
1,How not to transfer a classic to DVD,"This DVD of the classic Eisenstein movie is a bitter disappointment. The image quality is very bad with fuzzy pictures, wanting contrast and noise. The English subtitles can not be turned off and the opening credits have been butchered (live original footage and credits replaced by stills and English credits). Avoid and wait for a decent release of this wonderful film on DVD."
5,Wonder-ful,I looked for this last year and it seemed to be out of print. I use it with the John Muir book in a series of outings to our school prairie and garden for nature journaling with the children in my class. These are the sort of superheros I encourage my children to know.
2,Beautiful but who is the audience?,"I bought this book for a child because I love Rachel's work. The images are beautiful, but the text is preachy and adult. The language is not through the eyes or ears of a child, and that is the audience I wanted to captivate. I am not giving the book to the child, I will donate it to a library - don't know who will use it. Bummer."
5,Love it.,"This is my favorite Cocorosie album. It's beautiful and inspiring, and when I put it on the record player, I leave it there for a couple days. Which is fine since there are lyrical layers to unpeel in order to really hear them. Magic on vinyl."
2,White Monkey Girl Trash,"This would be a good album, but the use of the n-word repeatedly in ""Jesus Loves Me"" is stupid. I would say it would have been fine if the lyrics went something like this:""We are two ugly white trash slutttz with nasty teethand saggy buttz. Our skin is pale as a rotten crackajack floatin in chlorine, but we can sing like saltines cuzthats are thing. We have no soul, but we can write nice whitemelodies about Jesus and we know how to pooh in the toilet bowl.We aren't as talented or as cool as our n-word friends and their n-word lives, but we want you to like us even though our PUS5IES smell like rotten chives.""That would be a good song, and would be a much more realisticinterpretation of themselves."
4,hmmm...,"I wanted to write an oozing review of this work. It strikes me from several angles. I've only got two comments in my mouth:1.This seems to be an attempt at a reproduction of something akin to the duende of Edith Piaf and an operatic legacy and,2. I feel this album is meant to be heard at lower volumes. Higher volumes distort the sound quality a bit, though I'm wondering if this isn't done on purpose in an attempt to nod to older recordings. There's something really great about the imperfection of the recording (or at least the one that I own). It doesn't come off as gratuitous nor badly produced (the levels all seem to be well mixed), it's just there. A whimsical album."
1,Very Poor,"Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album."
1,Not for Roulette,"Bad craftmanship. Roulette wheel did not work, spins once and then stops. I knew that it was going to be on the small side, but it is barely usable size. I returned the item. Do not recommend."
4,Not bad at all,"I ordered this to use for a ""casino"" theme party I was hosting. It is small but worked nicely. It's not for the hard core gambler, but for beginners or people who just want to play and have a little fun, this fits the bill. All boards were well painted and velvet lining nice. Chips are tiny and roulette wheel needed some work. We used a screwdriver and exacto knife to shave the wood base a bit. Also applied some oil to the spinner - it worked GREAT after that. For the cheap price, it was worth it!"
2,look elsewhere for roulette,"Nice, tidy game set. Bought mainly for roulette wheel game - wheel didn't spin evenly. Barely made it 3 revolutions before sticking at the same few numbers each time. Other games still good."
2,Dishonest marketing,"The price of this iron was reduced to $24.99 with the purpoose of missing the $25 order for free shipping, then they trap you into buying another item or pay over $7 for shipping. Now, to make matters worse, they omitted the most important feature of the iron; that the soleplate is aluminum."
1,"So lame, barely even worth reviewing","1. I have several concerns related to this movie.A: First of all, I can't believe how many people gave this movie a favorable rating. I'll just leave it at that.B: Second of all, this movie suffers on several fundamental fronts. The acting... well, it's just lame. The portrayals were uniformly stiff and unconvincing. It was just very boring watching these people act their roles. And then... the story itself was convoluted / unrealistic / dumb etc...2. Thus, when you have terrible acting and a more lame / convoluted plot line=a complete dud of a movie.3. By the way, another piece of evidence that this movie is a complete dud: it's on amazon prime streaming. Look I love amazon and I'm a prime member, but there's a reason certain recent movies make it to prime streaming; ie no one is willing to pay to watch it etc..."
1,bad S.F.,"For hard-core S.F. films this will be a disaster. The casting of Jake G. is really off the mark, like casting Jim Carry in Goodfellas. This is a weak entry, nowhere near the other competitor in its class, Inception, which I also disliked. I suppose I might have found it tolerable if someone else were cast in the lead role, for JG is truly an awful embarrassment of an actor. The first minute of bizarre facial expressions in the train scene prove that. This ""acting"" had me in stitches."
1,Source Code made me lose brain cells,"Do yourself a favor and don't watch it. Bad acting, no plot, predictable and just terrible. Whoever wrote the script and directed this movie needs to get fired."
3,"A Pale, simplified version of 12 Monkeys","Source Code has been likened to Groundhog Day, Matrix, and Quantum Leap. Perhaps in a glancing way, yes. It's really a pale, simplistic riff on 12 Monkeys, the superb sci-fi starring Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Source Code manages to cover very little ground (in the ""past"" world) and provide minimal character development when compared to 12 Monkeys. I do like the fact that it has an upbeat ending (possible spoiler**: although it's flawed from a pure sci-fi, quantum-theory standpoint - definitely invokes a paradox when you consider who Jake must be in the end). This movie is perfect for an evening that needs no intellectual challenges, minimal violence or bad language, and ends with a positive love-story. Definitely has a good triumphs over evil theme and in the end love conquers all - and that makes it worth watching."
4,Source Code and Deception,"If you found Deception a bit complicated and hard to follow, Source Code is much simpler and just as entertaining. Of course, there are lots of holes in the story line, but then time travel lends itself to that. Jake is the romantic lead but looks sick and hungover. But his eyes are still amazing so the love connection was not too hard to believe.Nice surprise of a movie we knew nothing about."
4,Pretty Good -Surprisingly!,"With all the so-so (at best) movies out lately I was happily suprised that Source Code was actually a pretty good watchable movie that made sense. It had some Inception-type moments (I hated Inception) but they were well developed and were consistent with the plot line. Source Code also borrowed a theme from Star Trek TOS episode ""The Menagerie"" were Captain Pike who was badly injured in active duty was able to enjoy life in another dimension. Overall a good movie-I might even buy it on bluray."
4,Eight minutes to find a terrorist.,"The trick is you can repeat those eight minutes until you find him.Take this simple premise; add in a super secret government experiment, personal lives and some compassion. Mix well and make into an entertaining movie. Saying more would convert this from a review into a spoiler. The film never drags nor is it repetitious. Each segment is the same but with a different twist as the list of suspects narrows down to the terrorist. The ending is a real surprise and great fun. This is not Shakespeare, Williams or another great playwright. The dialog supports the story and the acting supports the dialog. Both are entertaining and keep our attention.I found this to be an enjoyable way to spend an evening."
4,Refreshing movie1,"Finally a creative movie that makes you think about what happened well after the movie is over. Source Code takes a Quantum Leap like approach in this movie and even though the movie really takes place on a train it does not seem to get old. Plus, at only 1:30 runtime it never seems to slow down. It's a movie that you need to see."
5,Watch,Very interesting movie get comfortable in your seat and take it in. Superb acting by the lead actors and would recommend to all
3,So So,"First of all, the picture quality and the sound was very good.If you watched this movie in a theater and wanna buy still, buy the bluray. It's well transferred.But the story, I didn't liked it.I didn't liked it when I watched at the theater, I didn't liked it when I bought and watched again.I like his other movie MOON very much and a great fand of the director.But this one, na~~"
3,Source code,Not sure why this movie is not available to rent... only to buy. Its a good movie but not a classic that i would like to have in my personal collection.
4,Fun Movie!,"This was worth renting. Interesting plot, suspenseful at times, fast action, love interest. Good flick that will appeal to guys, but with some chick-flick characteristics."
4,Worth Renting,This was a very good movie and worth renting. It's not that long of a movie (only 93 minutes) but the story kept moving along and it wasn't drawn out which I like for the most part. If you like sci-fi type movies then check this one out.
4,Great Movie in a weak year for even halfway decent ones,"Just a great movie. No real hidden political agenda (other than perhaps wringing every bit you can out of a servicemans enlistment). GREAT acting, plot, direction, editing.....a real surprise considering every other movie I have been unfortunate enough to see that was released this year.I only regret that I didnt see it at the theaters....woulda been even better.....but the video is certainly worth at least renting."
5,"It's so good to see that Intelligent, well done movies still exist","Acting - awesomePlot - awesomeDirecting -awesomeEffects- awesomeIf you still enjoy being treated as an intelligent human being without compromising creativity, action, supsense, drama, sensuality, fun and believability in a movie - then this one is for you. Awesome movie."
3,Sugar coated ending ruins an otherwise good movie...,I thought this movie was really good up until the last 10 minutes when the wheels came off and it got all sappy. A sad ending would have made more sense.
4,very good movie,I purchased the movie on cyber Monday and received the movie by Wednesday. Fast shipping. Entertaining movie. Thank you Amazon.
3,"High Hopes, Entirely Crushed","If you watch a lot of mind-bending, sci-fi movies, you have probably thought about seeing this movie. However, if you are this type of person, you will see through the plot within the first couple of minutes and hope something surprising happens. It doesn't. The plot feels quickly thrown together, hardly thought out, and Jake Gyllenhaal, who I think can be a great actor, is boring in this movie. I loved him in Love and Other Drugs and thought he was good in Brothers, but he's a very static character here. The movie could have been great, but it fell incredibly short. Watch it if you have some time to kill, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,on time,"Arrived on time.. It was shrink-wrapped, the case was a little damaged, but the disc was in perfect condition and played wonderful, it was a gift for my son and he is happy"
3,In Desperate Need of a Director's Cut,"Despite the incomprehensible sci-fi explanation behind the technology, this was a pretty solid movie up until the last 10 minutes. The producers chickened out and caved in to the movie studios and focus groups, and tacked on a terrible fairy-tale ending.If it stuck with the existential ending, Source Code would easily be 4+ stars. Here's hoping we see a Director's Cut."
4,I liked it.,"A good movie. I thought it was very imaginative. It surprised me a few times, and I liked the ending."
3,"Close, But No Cigar...","A decent cocktail of ""Quantum Leap"", ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" which sees Jake Gyllenhaal's s air-force pilot seconded into a covert military operation and forced to relive the final eight minutes of a commuter train bombing - via the expedient of a quantum simulation - in order to try and ascertain the identity of the bomber and avert a further terrorist catastrophe.It's a decent enough film although not quite the tour-de-force I was hoping for from ""Moon"" director Duncan Jones's second feature. Gyllenhaal makes a nicely tweaked lead in the Bruce-Willis-in-12 Monkeys tradition but the rest of the cast - with the exception of Vera Farmiga and a criminally underused Jeffrey Wright - are fairly forgettable.Definitely a case of ""Close but no Cigar""; unfortunately not quite the classic it could have been with a little more polish."
2,"Preachy, and Not Even In a Subtle Way","The Suspense aspect was the movie's best feature. The Right-To-Die Message and the slurs against the Defense Establishment were turn-offs. From here, I'm going to spoil a bit, so stop if you don't want to know.The notion of being reincarnated as a public employee in Chicago as a sort of Liberal Nirvana would be parody in a saner world. Then again, if the world were sane, I wouldn't have seen this movie in the first place."
2,Predictable and boring,"Jake Gyllenhaal continues to create unimpressive movies. If you can't figure out who the terrorist is in the first scene, you aren't very good at noticing the obvious. If you think the movie won't end exactly how it does, then you are not good at noticing the obvious. Yes, there is a minor twist in the plot - one that makes the premise even more absurd - but maybe some will find that cool. I did not.This is not a good movie. It requires zero critical thinking and even less intelligence. It's almost like a comedy writer tried to write an suspenseful action film, but forgot that you need a solid storyline and plot to create suspense - and a halfway decent special effects budget to blow up trains.Don't do it. Not worth the time, not worth the money, and not worth the time."
1,send me back in time so I can unsee this movie,"OK. So you invent one of the most amazing technical marvels in history and then name it SOURCE CODE!!!!!?!?!?! That's like building the pyramids and calling them rock piles. This movie had a good idea and then proceeded to ravage it with idiocy. Seriously this is a pathetic scifi movie written for people who have half a brain. I will give it this... I was interested for the first half or so. Then you realize the doofus who named the movie ""source code"" probably came up with the rest of the movie. Honestly it felt like someone who only writes cheesy romantic comedies for a living was given a treatment and forced to make a scifi movie. They were obviously way out of their depth when they made this.I can't believe people are giving this over 2 stars. I know a ton of people who have seen this movie and not one of them enjoyed it."
4,Good Idea! Interesting Sci-Fi. Maybe not for all though.,"Since I like sci-fi and advanced sci-fact, I had a few issues with the outcome and premises in this flick. If you're into the possibilities of time travel and wormholes you should like this movie. If sci-techi thinking is not your bag you might not get the implications of the movie and not follow it at all. Even though the science is arguable, as a sci-fier I liked it. It certainly was fast moving! Most acting was decent too."
3,Worth a watch!!,"With out giving to much away the whole film is set around the 8 minutes on a train that keeps happening over and over, I will say this and that is the audience/viewer is as much in the dark from the start of the film as Jake Gyellenhalls character is!"
3,Disappointing.,Disappointing and almost boring. We were able to guess the two major plot elements not long after the movie started. If you have nothing else to watch then take a chance. Otherwise stay away.
2,Sauce Coda,A film that's been done to death (pardon the pun) many times before. Or has it?Maybe it's me - perhaps I keep re-living someone else's life and I'm sitting ina cinema watching a film about a man who goes back in time to save lives but doesn'tquite succeed the first five times but then does and then falls in love and goes ona date with his new girl and they sit in a cinema and watch a film about a man whotravels back in time to save lives but doesn't quite succeed but then does and thenfalls....etc etc.Ad nauseum.This was a much-hyped film that failed in just every department. A huge disappointment.I think I've said that before.......
3,Somewhat entertaining suspense/action,"This movie is above-average compared to a standard action/bomb movie. I'd recommend this to you if you were kind of bored, looking for a fun movie. As a bonus, there are a few moments that cause you to think and reflect on your own life. I wouldn't say it's groundbreakingly good or anything (I don't see why RottenTomatoes gave it 91% fresh, this is more like a 60% fresh movie to me), but it did keep me entertained for the full duration."
3,Twists and turns,I picked this up as it was billed as something that would keep you guessing till the end. But I found it pretty predictable and similar to other movies covering this kind of ground. Still it was ok and the acting was top notch.
5,Not The Man Who Was Never Born but close enough,"They say there are no new stories in Hollywood, just old stories retold. That's pretty much the case with Source Code. And why not? Trying to change the past to improve the present sounds mighty appealing these days. Anyhow, it's surprisingly fun. The actors are likable, the pace is reasonably fast and the ending is pretty uplifting for a ""brain in a jar"" movie. Originality? I kept thinking of what happened to Captain Pike at the end of the Star Trek TV episode. But that's ok.I should also mention that even on my ancient tube television the opening shots of Chicago are just friggin spectacular. I'm guessing this has to do with the use of a Red camera about which I know little except that it's state of the art. Either that, or the weather in Chicago has improved dramatically since when I lived there."
5,A really excellent science fiction and suspense movie,"There are very few movies that can grab you and carry you along, right from the beginning, and neither lose that edge or become overly melodramatic. This movie really did it. I'm not going to tell you the plot, as that's not the point of a review like this. But go see it, it's a wonderful movie. I saw it on the DVD which was excellent as well."
3,"Movie kept me engaged, until the end...","I would have given this four stars if not for the ending. The movie was suspenseful and I was entertained, but it just seemed like the end didn't fit with the rest of the movie. I rented it because I remember being intrigued by the trailer when it was released in theaters. Overall, I am not disappointed that I watched it, but as the end approached, I kept thinking ""there has to be a twist, this has to pick up pace again""! Didn't happen."
4,source code,very interesting movies with the way that he keeps going back in time to find the bomber and basically save everything.good entertainment
5,Sunbeam Hot Shot,"Love this item. We have owned a Sunbeam Hot Shot for years. In fact, we purchased our first one in harvest gold. I have given them as gifts and they are always well received and appreciated."
4,Hot Shot hit spot,This was a Christmas gift for my brother. He opened it and ran to the kitchen to try it out. He proclaimed it a hit. Large enough for his big mug and definitely heated up quickly. I'm just disappointed he didn't offer hot cocoa to all of us.
5,Fastest & easiest way to get one mug of boiling water,"I've always had one or two Hot Shots since they first came out in the 1970's. It's the perfect simple little machine for the office or dorm room, or even master bathroom if you want a cup of tea without trekking to the kitchen.Because you heat only exactly as much water as you need, it's faster than using my fancy expensive electric kettles, and much much faster than a cheapo hot pot. Note, though, that tall ""tankard"" style coffee mugs won't fit under the dispenser nozzle.It won't last you forever, but will last for several years of daily or daily-plus use, in my experience. Great little appliance."
2,Hot Shot Not So Hot,"Product only works GREAT if you have standard height mugs no taller than 4-1/2 inches tall. Taller mugs get caught on the downspout and spill contents. Sundbeam remodelled this one, their original Hot Shot accepted the taller mugs, probably why this one was on sale. I loved my original one, and hope Sunbeam corrects this model in future."
5,Sunbeam Hot Shot,Very nice product; easy to use; safe for older children and elderly; heats water very quickly; exactly what I wanted; exactly as described;
5,Simply the Best!!!,"Quite a few years back, my wife and I were given this product as a Christmas present, and although a little skeptical at first, it has proven itself worthy of its name, and we've had three of them since then. They are just the best. If you want a quick cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, this is the baby for you. Plus, we've used it to heat up hot water when our babies were first born, and it came in really handy, as opposed to getting the water boiling on the stove. And you know how long that can take.A marvelous product, and I hope they keep it around. It's a wonder!!!"
4,Great value; works very fast,"I bought this to heat water fast (to heat up bottles of frozen breastmilk) and it works as advertised. The water definitely finishes boiling about 16 oz of water in under 90 seconds.Pros: very simple, very fast, great price, takes up little counterspace.Cons: short cord, a little difficult to drain completely, the dispenser button doesn't seem durable enough, reservoir could be a bit bigger (to hold more water).I've had it for about 4 days now, so it's too soon to tell if it will be durable, but since the parts seem to be simple, there shouldn't be an operational breakdown unless a part breaks. After dispensing what I can, I just leave the top open so the rest of the water can evaporate."
4,Simple & Convenient,"This little gadget works great. It boils water in seconds. I bought it for my husband and he loves it. He makes tea every night with it.I personally like my drinks really hot and prefer to bring my water to a boiling point. The Hot Shot is not hot enough for me.But overall, it is a great product. Well worth the money."
3,New Hot Shot inferior to old Hot Shot,"I have been happily using old Hot Shots (home and office) for many years and purchased them as gifts for departing college students. Great, simple pice of equipment to heat water quickly and safely. The new ones have to be plugged and unplugged to turn on and off instead of hitting the ""heat"" button. What an awful renovation."
2,Great concept - lousy execution,"It's very handy; almost a necessity if you drink a lot of tea, etc. We had one many yrs ago -- it was great and lasted a long time. And we have had several more since.They are now made in China, and thus the ""quality"" is now JUNK. As other reviewers point out, they are apt to leak/drip, heat inconsistently [some go crazy steaming up the room], and conk out completely within a couple of years.Unfortunately, there is no alternative similar product that I am aware of."
1,Item received not item advertised,"The item listed, pictured on the page and that I ordered was a Sunbeam Hot Shot 3211. The item received was a Sunbeam Hot Shot 6170, which was far too large to fit in my counter space. I returned the item in accordance with the instructions included in the packaging. Brand Variety did not refund return shipping on this item. Amazon.com finally made things right with me by issuing an Amazon merchandise credit."
1,"Heats fast, dies fast too","I bought one of these only because the one I have is 1970s advocato green and has seen better days, but it sure gave me years of service. The Sunbeam, which worked fine while it lived, melted inside (possible fire hazzard) about 2 months ago after 10 months of use. The old green guy's back on the counter making hot water for my tea every day.I'll try another and see how long it lasts. Not impressesd. PLUS, the PRICE has GONE UP by $4 (25%!!!) since I bought it in December 2003!!"
3,Sunbean Hot Shot,"I had my old Hot Shot for 15 yrs or more and I have to say I liked it much better than the new one. First they reversed the switches so I have had to get accustomed to that change. Second, the lid doesn't uncover the whole tank so it is a little bit inconvenient to pour liquid into and to clean. Third, it didn't come with a matching white cup. The old one had a matching Almond cup. But it works, so guess it will be OK!"
4,Sunbeam Hot Shot,"This product heats water to boiling in about 30 seconds. Wonderful for making hot chocolate, tea, etc. My only complaint is that it tends to drip a little water out if water is left standing in the unit. A previous Hot Shot that I had did not have this problem."
5,Super little pot,"Fast for those mornings when you are running behind. Whether it be coffee, tea or water for oatmeal it will have you out the door in no time at all."
3,Liked the original version better,I ordered this item because the one pictured by Amazon showed the older model. It has more space for a taller mug. Drill Spot accepted the return promptly and courteously. Wish I could find the old model!
4,"Great machine, but older model better",This is my third Hot Shot. I absolutely love it. The only thing I don't like about this model is that it does not come with a plastic measuring cup like the older models.
3,Sunbeam Hot Shot,"Been using the appliance since my Grandmother introduced us to Hot Shot in the older form in the late 80's. Carried it with on trips, sent it to college, and gave it as gifts over the years.Recently had to purchase the new model and must say it is not of the quality of the older one. First new model lasted only a few months with the switch in the back going out first. If the second goes that fast may be looking back to the vintage tea kettle on the stove!"
5,Can't live without a 'Hot Shot'.,"There is only one and it is perfect.Instead of boiling a whole kettle of water the Hot Shot does only a cup, so whether its a quick cup of hot tea, or a bowl of noodles, this does the job and saves time and money.Great idea, like the light switch it is a must have for any home."
5,Hot water fast,This is a very good way to get hot water fast. It's easy to fill and operate. Works perfectly for what it does.
2,bleh,"its garbage, for one it leaks water if you forget to empty it (and you will trust me), second now and than when you plug it into a wall it will start automatically with or without water, third there is no off button"
5,Hot water in seconds!,"When I need a cup of hot water for oatmeal or tea, this machine delivers. It is really fast!"
2,Great....for about 2 years,"Our first one lasted.....over a decade??????? When we replaced it, we got one that lasted about 2 years. Great item, but didn't have a long life."
2,DID I ORDER A USED DICTIONARY???,"The dictionary I received is what I wanted,but it appears to either be a used one or one that has been in stock for awhile.The cover is worn,the outer edges of the pages are discolored and there were numerous pages that were dog eared.Did I order a used book? If not I expect delivery of a new book.I don't see me having to pay shipping to return this book as it could be expensive."
3,product does keep my legs warm,This product does keep my legs warmer while sitting in my night gown and working around the house. But the shipping cost was a bit high. It does stand up to what they are called leg warmers.
2,Coming apart in less than a week.,"My house is cold; I wear leg warmers over my leggings, so I can wear them a few times before washing. After 2 - 3 days, the (very thin) strip of elastic at the top had pulled away from the knit fabric. I hate to see what will happen once they're washed. I'd advise people to spend a little more money on a better product."
4,Good Purchase,I ordered a pair of these in black & I'm very satisfied.It's hard to find legwarmers in stores where I live and these were the exact material I was looking for.Very authentic
2,disappointed,Well I was very disappointed when I opened my new leg warmers to find there were holes in them. Not only did I pay $14 for them but I found thicker more comfortable ones at the mall for $7:(
2,Disappointed,"Kudos to Dance4Less for replacing right away the pair of legwarmers that stretched out of useability within a week. However, no product should become useless so quickly.I bought two pairs - black & dark grey. The dark grey turned out to be rather light grey -- but, hey, that's the risk of purchasing things online. The black pair I wore - without first washing them - and each stretched badly. One of the two would not stay up after the 4th wearing.The replaced pair I washed/dried before wearing, and it seems to be working better."
2,Quality not as expected,"I have previously ordered 2 pair of these leg warmers in navy and been satisfied with them. The most recent pair, in gray, were worn only 3 times and started to unravel around the elastic. These are worn by someone in a wheel chair to keep their legs warm due to poor circulation and don't receive any wear, because they can't walk or wear shoes when using the leg warmers."
2,Leg Warmers,Received leg warmers promptly although was not pleased with the quality. Thought they would have been thicker than showed. Thanks anyway.
5,love 'em,"i bought two pair from this company along with a variety from other companies. i am not a dancer but i have to walk my dog a couple of times a day in the snow and cold and found these legwarmers superior to the others i tried out .... they actually were long enough and baggy enough to fit over all the layers i already wear (long winter underwear, socks, cordurays) .... i am using the other varieties as lower-arm warmers but i am ordering even more of the Knit Leg Warmers as they are not only warm but they FIT ..... this may be a store of ""dance"" products but the leg warmers are a quality product which can successfully be used for other reasons than to keep ""muscles"" warm for dancing ......"
1,The Pits,"It's been amusing in the past viewing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", proclaimed by many to be the worst movie ever made. At least that movie was so bad that it was funny/appealing. However this, ""Gangster Story"", is just simply the worst movie I can recall seeing. This is so bad in every catagory (writing, acting, directing, filming and editing) that it is just terrible. Honestly it deserves 0 stars. No fun watching this cheapy. Virtually nothing is plausable, connected or makes sense. Save your money and even more importantly, your time, and don't waste a second on this bomb...it's the pits! Worse than ""Lepke"".""Gangster Story"" really puts in doubt the depth of Walter Matthau's actual talent. (He starred and directed)"
2,Stinks.,"This pad works. Has great response too. Durability: no. This pad will rip and tear and fall apart. I was using socks and it teraed after awile! Not worth 20 bucks. I used socks on this pad and still it has ripps and tears all over. Now it is covered with scotch tape! This pad is crappy. Don't buy. After 2 months a couple ripps. 5 months, it's getting pretty bad.After 8 months it won't even be a pad! It will be covered with scotch tape! Don't go buy a dance pad for 100 bucks, but don't do the other extreme and buy this. Get a good pad for about 50 bucks."
3,Dented Cans,"I love everything about this soup, and recently bought a case. To my dismay, every single can in the case was significantly dented. I'm wondering if this is how damaged cans get a second chance at distribution."
4,One of the best broccoli soups I've eaten,"I was that there were slightly bigger chunks in this soup, but otherwise it is great. Tastewise it is perfect."
3,Faces,"Was really dissappointed in the language recorded on this recording! Just gave us all a taste of your ""true colours"" Chris!"
2,Disappointed,"I was kind of enjoying it until we hit the Pisses me off song and the ""F"" bombs were dropping. That kind of crap in music is not for me....and I wonder why there's not a parental advisory on it for language. It wasn't necessary for his talent. I think I'll stick to TSO."
5,absolutely smokin',"I'm a huge fan of metal. I started buying tapes in 1985, and always gave the not so well known bands a try, such as King Kobra, Black and Blue, Kick Axe, Axe, Armored Saint, Saxon and most notably, Savatage. I'm not one to settle for just what's on the radio, even though I like to listen to it. Fast forward to 2005, and over the years it's been increasingly hard to find good music. With over 700 rock/metal cd's, I've got a pretty good selection of mandatory rock.Every once in a while, a cd comes along that gives me goosebumps, because this cd is THAT FREAKIN' GOOD!!!!. I won't go into details of every song, since it's been done before. However, if you are a true fan of real musicianship, outstanding music, and want to weed out the posers and wanna be's, Buy This Cd NOW!!!!If you are a real music fan, and definitely s savatage fan, do not hesitate to pick up this cd."
5,Excellent Quality Small Appliance - Chopster,"After reading the customer reviews (all 5 star) I decided that this chopster would be a good buy. I received my delivery today from Amazon (Only took about 3 days) and am very pleased. The unit is sturdy & durable, easy to take apart & clean, simple to put back together, priced correctly and fun to use.It is a small appliance, not for big jobs. The bowl holds up to 1 1/2 cups of food. Cut food into uniform 1/2 inch pieces before processing. The unit is safe to use as the blades will not spin unless the lid is locked into place. My impression is that Toastmaster thought of everything and provided an excellent value for the $11.99 price."
2,Chops well but lid breaks,"I loved it when I got it and used it every day. It easily chopped onions, carrots, garlic, celery, broccoli, cauliflower. It's not going to work for things like flax seed, however.That said, I'm frustrated. There's a small extension on the lid that hooks into the machine and locks it so you can't accidentally open it while it's running. Not once but TWICE that piece broke off. I actually bought a second machine JUST to get a new lid.Don't bother. Find another brand that's made better."
1,Works well....but only a few times!,"I got this little chopper and was please with it for about after using it two times. All of the sudden, about a month after purchase, it simply stopped working? No misuse, just sitting on the counter. It just wouldn't turn on. We tried everything and would have returned it but the box was already thrown away. Don't take a chance."
1,You get what you pay for,"I figured that with a 2 adult household this would be ideal.<br /><br />I wore it out in 3 weeks. <br /><br />Look, want to make really lean ground meat? A minichopper should do that, right? You buy a slab of pork or beef that's low in marbling, cut it into cubes and this should make you ground meat. Well, it'll jam, even if you only put 3 or 4 cubes in it.<br /><br />It wears out quick.<br /><br />Going to crush any ice or grind meat? Spend money on a higher wattage stronger machine.<br /><br />Otherwise, you'll just buy one after another after another of these.<br /><br />"
1,Toastmaster 1122 Chopster,Piece of JUNK. Lid does not stay secured while chopping; very cheap thin plastic is used making the appliance unsturdy for heavy duty chopping ie: Carrots. Don't waste your money: buy a Black & Decker chopper for a few dollars more; B & D Chopper is very heavy duty and long lived.
3,Great little chopper....until,"I purchased the Toastmaster chopper about 2 years ago and use it once every few weeks. It is just the right appliance for chopping onions, celery, etc. Today, while opening the lid, the plastic piece that engages the motor broke off. There is no way to fix it and I don't think I can buy a replacement part. It is a shame to throw away a perfectly good machine because one small piece is broken - but it won't work without it :-("
2,You get what you pay for,"I got this exact model from Amazon about a year ago. I bought this model because I wanted a cheap, small processor for quick jobs. My main complaints are that: 1)It leaks if you are processing wet ingredients (like salsa); 2) It doesn't have enough power to handle more difficult jobs like Parmesan cheese; 3) It will still work even if the lid is not completely on (safety issue). It is OK for jobs like chopping nuts, but don't expect it to chop anything FINELY (humus will NEVER be smooth). If you really find the price too irresistable to resist, you will get the maximum use out of it if you pulse instead of holding the button down to continously process; otherwise, expect a strong burning odor and the blade may pop out of place. Splurge for a more top of the line model that will last for years."
4,Impressed how long this chopper lasted - 7 years until lid broke.,"This thing got weekly use, chopping Thai chili's, shallots and garlic. It has functioned for well over 7 years, but it was dropped accidently this week, and the plastic lid locking guide broke off on one side (there are two). The motor is very strong, and except for the fragile design of the lid's locking mechanism (minus 1 star), this thing is well worth the little money that we paid ($6) almost a decade ago."
2,Chopster lids need better design,"The Toastmaster chopster 1122 is a fine little machine, but the plastic lid is too flimsy and breaks easily making the machine inoperable. Now I can't find replacement lids, so will have to throw away the whole machine. Hopefully, Toastmaster will redesign and learn from this."
3,"Definitely ""mini""","I wish I would have gotten a larger one. It's very small, perfect for a one-serving kind of thing."
3,Item does not match picture.,"If you want a spark tester that looks like the one pictured you'll have to order the OTC HEI one, which is sold on Amazon. If you order this one just warned that it does NOT look like the picture, and performs differently. It requires a much lower kilovolt amount to arc, as compared to the OTC spark tester that looks like the picture. This will give you false readings on an HEI ignition system, as you might have a weak coil but still get spark."
4,ignition tester review,"I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but the mere fact I was finally able to find one for when my son and i get back to working on his car is a relief in itself."
1,DECEIVING SUPPLIER,"The item I was sent is completely different from the picture. I've chosen to keep the product in case it comes of use, but I am VERY unhappy with your services. I expect to get what I see and at this time I was greatly deceived!"
1,Regret buying it...,"Thought this would be a great way to ""hide"" the can opener since it claimed it folded out of sight. It does but you have to unscrew the holder it's in, flip it back and tighten it and it doesn't seem strong enough to hold it. Then when you do fold it down, it doesn't come down completely straight so any can with liquid or juice will likely come spilling out because the can is slanted (unless you hold it straight while the can is opening). Now the blade is starting to not even go into the cans and you have to force it and we've only had it for just over 3 months. For lack of a better description...piece of crap."
1,"Lousy, Lousy, Lousy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This piece of junk should have gone from the box it came in, directly to the trash can. Flimsy mounting apparatus, does not hold a can up to cut it, needs brute force to complete operation. Less time spent using manual can opener by Far!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does not deserve 1 star."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad!","I can actually get this thing to almost work on 1 can out of every 10 I try to open. It won't actually cut into the top well, won't hold the can when it does, and then will not open the entire can... it will leave just enough attached to be real safety hazard. I am so thrilled this thing is screwed into my cabinet. Looks like the cabinet isn't the only thing that got screwed..."
1,TOASTMASTER CAN OPENER,WILL NOT HOLD A CAN OF ANY SIZE OR LID SHAPE. THE GEAR WHEEL WILL NOT STAY ON THE CAN AND TAKES SEVERAL TRIES TO OPEN. POOR DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE.
1,HORRIBLE,This can opener was a waste of money!! It did not hold any can or even open one without stopping and dislodging itself a bunch of times. I was never even able to open one can with it. It would cost me more to mail it back than to throw it away. NEVER AGAIN!!
3,"Healthy maybe, but not tasty","I tried this and the cascadian farm version and this has a more chemical taste -- of course its enriched to be really healthy for you, but doesn't have the satisfying and yummy natural taste of the cascadian farm bar that has me going back for another case at the grocery store. Tasted too sweet and not quite chocolatey even."
2,They may be healthy but they are not too tasty,"I purchased this product thinking that I had found something that was good for me and good to eat. I'm sure there are those that would disagree, but in my opinion I did not hit the mark on the second part. I now have a case of granola bars that noone in my family will eat."
4,Tasty,"I looked through many catalogs and online sites to find a healthy snack for my diabetic spouse. I finally tried on Amazon not realizing that Amazon sold food products, too. It worked out great for him. Thank you."
4,French dub music,"High Tone must be quite little known all around the world and it has to change because the quality of their compositions deserve to be listened by all dub music lovers. ADN, will transport you, even if, according to me, their previous release called Opus Incertum (not available on Amazon at the moment i write) is even better. Honestly, if you like dub, you can buy this cd without hesitation. High Tone is great, spread the word."
5,Filipino Spirit World a Challenge to the Church,"Great book. Here's what back cover says about the book.A ""conspiracy of silence"" exists regarding certain religious practices of Filipinos. The church has largely ignored the spirit world belief system of its members. As a result, many Fiipinos bring their unmet spiritual needs to out-of-church spirit world practitioners such as faith healers, fortune-tellers and diviners.Filipino Spirit World challenges to meet not only its members' ultimate concerns (salvation, nature of God, heaven, and hell) but also their everyday concerns (sickness, business and investments, divination, fertility, etc.). This book also urges Christian leaders to include the spirit world in the scope of their ministry. Among the subjects discussed in the book are: the theological foundation of the spirit world, folk Christianity in the Philippines, western and Filipino worldviews, animism, and demonic possession."
3,Good When I Can Make It Work,"When I can make it work correctly, it's fine, though it still usually leaves a tiny sharp nub. This can be pressed down if I want to use the can for something else. However, it's often quite difficult to position the opener correctly to get it started, and the magnet tends to hover over the lid instead of touching it. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but OXO didn't provide any advice in their packaging. So I fished my old garden-variety can opener out of the box of stuff bound for a charity-store and am keeping it handy. I'd go for two-and-a-half stars if that were possible."
3,Sharp edge,"I expected to love this can opener - until I discovered that, contrary to the ads, it left a small, sharp metal spike on the inside of the can right where I could cut my finger. This was disappointing as it was the main reason I had asked for the opener at Christmas. Perhaps there is a soluton but I folowed the directions carefully."
4,Just Fine Can Opener,"Works like all can openers should, but most don't. Too expensive to give it a 5."
5,The Best Hand Can Opener I've EVER Used,"I love this thing. I have an electric can opener as well, but since we got one of these for Christmas, the electric opener hardly gets used. This is easy for people with weak wrists because it locks closed. Also, the magnet is handy to have.Be warned. The product description states that this is dishwasher safe, but the Oxo website says handwash only:http://www.oxo.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=447I have lots of high school students that drop by the house and help cook from time to time. They all love this thing. Ever seen youth excited about opening cans? I have since we got this.From a guy that loves gadgets, this is one of my favorite toys in the kitchen. It is a bit pricey, but worth it if you want to splurge a bit."
5,Unbelievable Kitchen Tool!,"The electric can opener....which screwed cans up more often than not anyway...now goes to the trash heap. This Oxo opener is fantastic. I can't even believe I'm writing a review on a can opener of all things, but this thing is just amazing. Works effortlessly and with no mess at all. Forget electric: this is the way to go!!!"
2,Oxo Can Opener,"This device appears at first to be an excellent product. However, very soon after I acqauired the product, two errors occurred: (i) the magnetic lid device began to malfunction, since the cutter did not sever the lids all the way around; (ii) and more importantly the product fell apart after two months, because the small pin at the top of the product holding the two halves of the product together fell out or otherwise failed. I was able to reassemble the two halves by reinserting the pin and fumbling around and finally reseating the two halves. However, at this price, such failure so early in the product's useful life is unacceptable."
5,Can Opening Excellence! Perfect Can Opener!,"Length:: 2:43 MinsI had a previous review up and it was based on using it from a friend I bought it for as a gift, so below is the 2010 version of my review since I finally bnought one for myself, LOL:I have used them several times at friends and others houses! I have given this as gift. And for some ""insane "" reason I have not purchased one of these for myself!*Slaps forehead* Maybe I should have had a V8V8 Vegetable Juice, Low Sodium, 46-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12), LMAO.What can I say it does its job greatly, has a magnet to help hold the lid once you remove it. Comfortable grip. Nice clean cut edges.In video I talk about this excellent can opener and I open a can of Kidney beans as a demonstratin of its awesome power!, Whoo hoo! LMAO!Additionally, a friend of mine has had her Oxo Good Grips Magnetic Locking Can Opener for over 4 years with no problems!"
5,Effortless to use,"Never thought a hand-held can opener would be easier to use than an electric, but this one is. Best of all, it's pain-free even though I have ""bad"" wrists."
4,oxo ho ho,"well, this one works better than the last 3 i've owned~ why is it so hard to find a good can opener anymore? specifically, one that doesn't skip off of the rim? my suspicion is that can manufacturers are now making the lip narrower so that they save 3 cents per million cans. anyway, this won out on the recent cooks illustrated canopener showdown, and i thought i'd give it a try. it's pretty good, but by no means a 5-star...i am gravitating toward the position that there is no such thing~ regarding hand turn canopeners, anyway...but, overall, a decent value for $20."
1,Not very scientific,"If this is how they turn out, maybe the interviewees can persuade me not to have a late baby. The majority of the subjects sounded incredibly shallow and immature. Fortunately,the author revealed that she used the ""snowball"" method to find her subjects, i.e she knew someone, and they knew some more friends, and then they got their friends,etc. So I am hoping the sample was skewed.Some points raised as disadvantages of older parents were that they look different than other parentsand don't understand teenagers! What kid doesn't think that? Age of the parent has little to do with it. One legitimate concern raised by interviewees was that an older parent may need care or pass on sooner in the child's life -that was one of the few things in the book worth thinking about in my opinion. Another valid point, but one that applies to any parent, is that a child should be wanted, valued and given priority in your schedule."
4,Garage Remote,Arrived on time. Remote range is good as well with a strong battery. It has a long life of usage before having to change the battery. I have another remote identical to this one. I only change the battery about once a year. Can start the garage door opening from a hundred feet or so away. The only annoyance found is the wire that holds the remote to the sun visor can make a noise as the car travels over bumps in the road. At first I thought it was a rattle coming from the dashboard of the car. But it turned out to be the garage remote.
5,Remote,i could not fine this remote Control any where else being that it is an old one and its not sold in the stores any more glad i found it here .. it works great.
4,Very Useful and Concise,"I used this book as a reference in fiction writing and found the opinions expressed to be very useful. Although no reference book will agree with my opinions completely, having a third parties view was helpful in naming my characters. I would recommend this book to another writer looking for names that reflect specific characteristics or to avoid obvious stereotypical names. Judging from my recent experiences at a K-12 school parents would do well to take a look at this book before they stick their beloved children with some of the monikers I have seen."
2,Not that great of a baby name book...,"Yeah, this book is fun...at first, but then it gets boring. The ""cute,"" ""popular"" or ""trendy"" names are the most favored. A name like Ariana is viewed as positive and beautiful, while something like Fern (which I think is cool) is seen as old-fashioned and ugly. There's also not enough names listed. If you're about to have a baby and you're looking for a name, this book isn't the way to go. It's very limited in the options, because for the most part it uses well-known and well-used names, or it goes the other extreme and uses names that you probably wouldn't ever consider. For example, I think names like Adolph and Henrietta are in here. There's no middle ground. In retrospect, I wasn't too thrilled with it."
4,great deal and resource,"I absolutely love this author and this book has helped me, my sister and countless friends name our kids. It's a must buy!"
1,Gross contradictions & one celebrity descriptions abound.,"This is a Renaming/Reprint of their 1990 book similarly titled ""The Baby Name Personality Survey"". This book is a survey of 30 to 150 respondents for each name on the feelings evoked by the names. This is a prime example of creation by multiple committees. Throughout the book there are numerous dichotomies and trichotomies, such as ""an old spinster who is plain, quiet, lackluster, and secretive or sophisticated and sexy."" Add to that theatrical characters or celebrities by respondents who appear to cumulatively know only one person (and that a character or celebrity)with the name, such as: ""Elvira [a] tramp who is weird, spooky, and sexy"" and a typical baby name book and we are left with a short baby name book and a bunch of near useless survey results. If you are after a book to help you choose a name for a child or book character, you can do better than this. And your own very brief survey of friends may be more accurate."
1,Skip It,"What people think of names change. Some of the views of these names are already outdated due to media influences. Also, not uncommon names that I LOVE are not even included in this book. The book is too thin, including only the most popluar and/or outdated names."
1,useless..,"Three years when I was pregnant with my daughter, I bought this book at our local book store. I had always loved the name Sophia so, that was where I turned to forst. When I scanned through the meaning I got down to when negative conotations might be associated with oy I was apalled!! It said that the name could make people think of a black maid!? WHAT??? I returned the book the next day. I still named her Sofia. My thought is if you like a name...who cares what other people will think (as long as it'a not a name like Pilot Inspecktor or something crazy like that!!)."
2,Misinformation abounds,"I have not read the actual book - there is a website - www.americanbaby.com - that says is using the book as a source for meanings of names. I can tell you that many of the names of Slavic origin are either partially or completely wrong. I got p.o.-ed enough to look up the book on Amazon and post this. I can't vouch for the rest of the names, but have these people done any research?"
4,Nice quality PINK Glove,"This is a nice quality glove for the price. Easily flexible and suitable for a 5-10 year old.This glove has a thick HOT PINK stripe running around the back of the glove and is clearly intended for a junior girl. It has a celebrity endorsement from a top female ballplayer attached. That is not called out in the description and the Pink is just barely visable in the picture here. I had to return the glove because my son didn't like it, so I want to make sure you are aware of the ""Pink"" factor before you buy this glove.Otherwise, it's a nice glove, and the hot pink stripe actually looks pretty cool in contrast to the rest of the black leather glove."
3,"Nice glove, great colors","Well, I would rate this one higher. But, our daughter prefers her cheap Rawlings glove over this one by far, even though her Rawlings is plain, and this one is the colors she prefers ... simply put, she chose performance over looks of the glove. I think it is a great outfielders glove, and she may yet get some good use from it.I am only giving it 3 stars because simply, the performance (flexibility, etc) of this glove is not nearly as good as the Rawlings glove."
4,"Good translation, good read.","I'm reading this translation for a class on 5th century BC Greece. I find Plutarch a fun writer with his emphasis on the moral behavior of his subjects, even when some of them (such as Themistocles) are not moral at all. This is also a very good translation, as Penguin is known for."
4,The Rise and Fall of Athens: Nine Greek Lives,I just got back from the Greek Isles last year. This book is better than those I bought and looked at there.
1,the price of slow service,I live in NY and I recently bought three books for my HIS1001 class from 3 different sellers all in one day last week. Sellers 1 and 2 were from Indiana and new jersey respectively and I received their books two days ago. Reasonable convention told me to buy the book I needed the most from a seller near me so i choose awesomebooksusa since I'm from NY and awesomebooks' hq is only 2 county over....yet i still wait for my order since i just got an official email today that my book has shipped =(....also tracking and confirmation like the other sellers would be nice too
5,Reflections,"George Howard I miss you! I have most his music. I have""Reflections"" on vinyl and decided I needed iton CD.Thank you!Ms. Wanda"
5,Law Dictionary (Barron's Legal Guide_,I am very satisfied with the service and the product. It meets the need of my brother who I bought this book for.
4,Law Dictionary,"Required book for my Paralegal course. Nothing wrong with the book or what is contained in it, but only beef is the size. I noticed that many of my fellow students had a Barron's law dictionary that was a third of the size and nicely bound. I should have looked further into law dictionaries before buying this one, as too big and clumsy."
4,Sunbeam 3108-8 Can Opener,"The can opener works good, and comes in handy when I have a larger can to open. the knife sharpener comes in handy."
4,it does the job and more,"not only does it open the large cans that a mechanical opener cannot, but it's knife sharpener does a great job"
1,a real piece of junk,"I purchased this same model of can opener years ago and it lasted 11 years! in fact, the motor still runs on the old one only the cutter is broken. This piece of junk lasted 33 days and we hardly use it (maybe once or twice a week). The motor and gears make such a racket that the dogs run and hide! How nice it lasted 3 days past the window to return it to Amazon. My first one was made in China too but this one is junk. I did not think it was possible for Chinese made products to get worse but this proves it! It is not Amazon's fault but I wish there was something else I could do besides pay $10 shipping to return to Sunbeam so they can ""determine if it defective or abused."" ridiculous!!!!"
3,USA made product -- Excellent performance,"Opener performs well. For me it was a little difficult to put together. I finally got it after reading instructions several times. I an not an assembly person.Opener is certainly worth its cost, when one considers that it is a knife sharpener as well.It could be more explicit as to how sharpener works."
2,"Not for the Long Haul""","At first it worked fine. I liked the feature of making it taller for tall cans. I like that it is made of hard plastic and it has eye appeal. After about 3 years, maybe less, the whole piece with the magnetic disc came off and it was annoying trying to get it back in there. I don't see the point in not making that a permanent piece in it's construction. After being burned with other Sun-beam products, I don't buy anything with that name on it. Nothing that they make lasts very long."
5,Excelent 1A,"Excelent 1A, great transaction, I will definitely buy any other item from this user. Really fast shipment and neat process."
1,I Really Dislike This Can Opener,"I was surprised there were people who love this thing! You can't be serious! It's annoying. If you have a tall can you have to turn the little thingy in the front to make the can opener tall. Hahahaha, too bizarre! You have to align the can just right, tipping both the can and the opener to get it to ""catch."" This is not my idea of a can opener! For the price, move along...do not buy this one!"
1,No stone or devise inside the sharpener. Useless item!,"This item does not have a stone, knife sharpener or anything whatsoever so you can sharpen a knife. I was sent a new one and low and behold, it was the same as the defective one. How can you sharpen a knife when there is no sharpener but only plastic inside the sharpener?"
1,Sunbeam Adjustable Can Opener 3108,"This is a poorly made product...the cutter part has cracked and I've only used it for about a month. Also the knife sharpener does not sharpen properly, it is poorly designed. I am very disappointed with this item."
3,broke after a little over a year,blade wore out and then it broke...had to throw away...it worked great at first but I consider it a disposable item.
5,Sunbeam Can Opener/ Knife Sharpener,Love it! I had originally purchased a Black & Decker can opener/ knife sharpener because I thought it was a good brand to buy. It was a piece of junk. I like the height adjustment dial on my new Sunbeam. I highly recommend this product.
3,did not last long,"It was a good can opener while it lasted but after a year of regular household use, the plastic around the cutting blade cracked away. It was good while it lasted but come on, they have to start making products that last a bit longer!I give it three stars only because the can opener I bought to replace this one (a Toastmaster) was a waste of time. That one got a one star right out of the box.My action plan is to ""go manual"" to turn key hand can opener, or better still an old reliable Army P-38."
1,Looks are deceving!,"This is the third Sunbeam can opener that I've bought. I wore the other two out (over a period of at least 20 years). I particularly liked them for the knife sharpener. No. 3 looked just like the earlier ones. I should have inspected it more closely. When I wanted to sharpen some knives, I discovered that there were NO BLADES in the housing! Of course, I had thrown the box out so I can't return it. I will order another one, but I'm hanging on to the box. If it had all its parts, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Average,"It's a can opener. Not too much to expect here. It works as stated. As in, it opens cans. I must say though, I remember my mother having a giant pale yellow one on the counter when I was a kid. It would sharpen any thing you put in it. American products were so much better then. I doubt this is even made in America."
4,Simple but effective,"I don't use hot glue guns much and I bought this one just to repair decoys that people have shot, but so far it works fine. Plug it in, let it get hot, and the glue comes out nice and easy and it doesn't drip. Couldn't ask for much more."
4,"Good gun, doesn't drip excessively","I do not use this routinely, as in crafts. I use it only as a ""tool"" to glue stuff together, fill holes, fix loose joints, etc.For that, it has done well, and importantly, it is not a ""dripper""."
1,Does not heat up consistently,"I am past the return date apparently though it has only been three weeks and I have only used three times. I can not get the gun to heat. Worked fine the first time, refused to heat the second time and tried to heat up the third time but you had to manually push the stick forward instead of using the trigger. Sorry but it is a piece of junk."
5,Top quality glue gun at a budget price,"Keep in mind this is larger than your normal budget glue gun but is of much better quality and the even pull of the ""trigger"" should be the new standard."
5,Excellent glue gun,"So many glue guns on the market have so many bad reviews that I spent quite a long time deciding which gun to buy. Many glue guns suffer from leaking nozzles, flimsy construction (breaking triggers especially), stands which don't work etc. This one had the best reviews overall, so I bought it even though there are less expensive models.Well, I'm glad I did. I have nothing but good to say about this gun. First of all, it doesn't leak. Not a bit. Secondly, the trigger is easy and smooth, thanks to its sliding design (as opposed to pivoting). It heats up fast and stays hot, even when dispensing glue at a high rate. The stand actually works, and the gun is plenty stable when using it. Finally, it seems plenty sturdy to do what it needs to do for many, many sticks of glue.Dunno what else there is to say about a glue gun, but if the mixed reviews of almost every other glue gun in a similar price range have you wary, be confident that this one will meet expectations."
5,Hefty Helper,"A gift for my ""crafter"" wife and she loves it. It replaces a small and difficult to use glue gun that gave her hand cramps after ten minutes of use. The Surebonder is large and easy to hold and use. Mamma is happy."
1,TOO BIG!!!,"I wish I had researched the size of this thing more before I bought it. If you'r interested in a hot glue gun for projects like making JEWELRY, CARDS, MASKS, and other general crafting then do NOT get this! It's just way too long (distance between your hand and where the glue comes out) and heavy to do any of these things! I can't tell you how well it works because I didn't even take it out of the packaging. I will post pictures up for a size comparison."
3,"No glue, further review to come.",I opened the box and couldn't believe it. I had to look twice. This glue gun doesn't come with any glue!Update: Works fine. As cheap as the glue is I don't know why it didn't come with some. I doesn't seem very sturdy.
5,best antacid ever,have had heartburn forever and if i want something i know will bother me i take this and no problem.it removes the acid from foods. it is calcium gluconate. my mom started taking it for a bladder problemsuggested by her doctor and it worked forthat too.made by the beano people. i dont know why the dont advertise this more.
5,This stuff works!,"Prelief works! Better off to buy the bigger bottle though, this one is great to carry around with you anywhere"
2,Use With Caution,"As a sufferer of Interstitial Cystitis, I was excited to try out Prelief since I've had to drastically change my diet to avoid more acidic foods. I followed the instructions on the bottle suggesting that Prelief be taken 3 times a day every day as opposed to only when acidic food is eaten. I took 2 tablets 3 times a day and within 24 hours I had a full-blown IC flareup on my hands which took a couple weeks to get under control, which included a doctor's visit, lab tests, and prescriptions. I haven't taken Prelief since, and am open to possibly taking it when I eat acidic foods, but nothing would induce me to take it regularly again. My doctor thought that perhaps it had made my bladder too alkaline too fast and upsetting its delicate balance is what caused a flareup. I am giving Prelief 2 stars because of the experience I had, but I am not discounting the possibility that I might be able to use it successfully in the future."
5,"A very pleasant recording, available here:","At the time of this review, this recording is available from 3rd party sellers, but you might want to know that it is also available as part of a box set:Sacred Masterpieces / Cantatas. That box is full of great recordings of great music, including this one, and I strongly recommend it."
5,what a line,Great quality super product i even shared the line with some of my fishing buddies and they love it very strong great for casting out i highly recommend it
3,Not very interesting,"Not terriby interesting or professionally produced. I only tried it twice and just couldn't get all the way thru it... although I could certainly do the stretches, it was just so boring.It might be better for older people (60's, 70's, or 80's) or for people who are rehabilitating from some injuries."
4,Great way to drink more water.,"While the directions say you can take the product with only 6 oz. of water I like to mix it with more. It dilutes the flavor a little bit, which could be better to begin with, but I find that it encourages me to drink more water. I usually mix the product with bottled water and sometimes I add just a little juice to make it taste better. But overall, I like the product, and Amazon offers it at a reasonable price."
2,Two Left Ears?,"These would indeed be worth 5-stars except that the photo shows that they are not ""mirrored"" earrings- the left and right ears are not supposed to have the same earring when the design is assymetrical. Fine jewelery earrings are supposed to be ""mirrored""."
1,Only lasted a month,"My wife bought this mixer about a month ago hoping that it would be a mixer that could last a while (at least a year or two) but after a month of once or twice a week use, it died, now it has been returned. I wouldn't watse the money even if the price and options look appealing."
2,"Another ""Halloween"" knock-off","While I found the film to be technically competent and have decent production values for a low-budget horror film, the basic plot of ""Frayed"" was too derivative of ""Halloween"" to be very enjoyable. A forced triple-twist ending, which employs two of the most overused cliches of the genre and undermines the story's internal logic, does nothing to redeem the end product.It's also a little sad that it took five screenwriters to create such a painfully unoriginal story. The co-directors have potential, and I'd like to see what they could do with some original material."
2,ugh....,"The movie would have been better if the actors weren't so wooden in their performance. The sister was the worst of the lot in my opinion. I was wanting her to be killed off so my suffering would end. The movie was interesting in some parts, I liked the way the killer concealed himself. But aside from that it was fairly pathetic."
2,Heavy Meds..,"Frayed started off well. The movie feels like a low budget Halloween type movie with a disturbed young boy and a brutal assault of a parent. The boy is then sent away to an asylum. Sounds like Halloween up to this point..Unfortunately, poor plot twists and wooden acting mar the second half of the movie and I found myself tired, disappointed, bored and a little annoyed by the time Frayed came to its conclusion. At one point I was so bored I literally pinched a loaf in my shorts. And I can honestly say that has NEVER happened before."
1,"You Get What You Pay For, or Not?","This low-end can opener is practically useless. 90% of the time it fails to operate completely, opening a portion of the can and then stopping. I paid $14.00 for it... and it's worth about ... well, it's not worth anything actually. I would NOT recommend this horrible can opener. I'd prefer using a nail and a hammer over this thing!"
3,Works well but noisy,"I have had this can opener for a few weeks now. It works well and I like that you can store the cord inside it. I have two complaints about it though..the little thingy on top that comes down to open the can falls off easily...not when the can opener is upright or working but if you pick up the can opener, it sometimes falls off; and this can opener is surprisingly noisy. Despite these complaints, I feel this can opener is worth the price."
2,Very poor,"Sorry to say, this opener was given to me as a gift. I thought all electric openers were pretty much the same, no dice. When it starts cutting, it works ok, but getting the can in the right position and the blade inserted right and everything turning correctly is like balancing three balls on top of each other. 4 times out of 5 I have to take the can back off and try again. Plus the arm that comes down flops around and tends to fall off. I do not recommend."
1,worst can opener we ever had,We just got this can opener out and tried to open a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup for a recipe we were making for dinner. We couldn't get it to work at all. It does not hold the can on and the blade pushes into itself. Luckily the other cans of soup we had had pull top lids otherwise we would not have gotten our recipe finished and would have had to rush off to buy another new can opener. We still need to buy a new can opener. This can opener was a wast or our time and money.
5,Gil Scott-Heron,"I bought this for myself a great insight to this talented man, my 23 year old son has found a author he did not know about!"
3,Best When Not Overreaching,"Many of the ECM artists selected for these anthologies contributed helpful liner notes, sometimes several pages' worth. From guitarist Rypdal, however, we get ""a few words."" The recordings assembled for this collection span three decades--""Tough Enough"" dates from 1971, while the 2nd Movement from Rypdal's Double Concerto for Two Guitars and Symphony Orchestra dates from 1996. Through all of the cuts, regardless of musical genre, Rypdal sounds like a pretty good rock guitarist who aspires to be something more. Not surprisingly, the cuts that work best are the ones where he simply plays rock guitar, such as ""The Return of Per Ulv,"" from 1985's If Mountains Could Sing."
4,Classic toy,"My son got this for his 3rd birthday and quickly lost or chewed on and ruined most of the viewing discs that go with it. However, the couple that are left, he enjoys looking at. Doesn't hold his interest for very long though. I think it might be better for a 4 or 5 year old when they are old enough to take better care of the discs. Of course, that all depends on how hard your child is on toys."
3,No Montana authors,"I gave this book to my mother, who is a Montanan. She complained that there were no Montana authors represented in the book."
4,Good value,"It's small, cheap, and easy to use. Great value and good snapshot camera. Read the fine print, though -- no optical zoom. Multiple flash modes are good, but it doesn't work so well with no flash in diffuse indoor lighting. Considering it was $100 with a 64 MB card, it was a great deal."
4,"Thank you, Santa!","Santa Claus was very inspired to give me this present!I enjoy a lot taking pictures, but I am not a pro and I often feel uncomfotable with high-tech devices. This camera is perfect for someone wishing to take simple pictures and make short length movies with an easy to use camera.Even if has only 2.0 mega pixels, the quality of the pictures is very good and so are the colors. Transfering pictures into the computer is very simple and the camera is so small and light, that it fits into a pocket.Just make sure you buy good batteries and an extra memory, so that you won't have to transfer the pictures too often to your computer. I promise you will have a lot of fun."
1,Money thrown down the drain!!!,"I received the camera for Christmas and used it twice. After I changed the batteries in it, the camera stopped working. I called Kodak and they said I would have to send it in for repair. After wating for a while without a reply, I called Kodak again to find out what was going on with my camera. They told me that water or some liquid got into it and corroded it and because of that, it would not be covered by the warantee. The camera was never near any water as I only had the opportunity to use it twice. Their customer service is awful and they want $130 to fix the camera. I would rather buy a new one than give them anymore of my money. Stay away from this camera!"
1,Horrible,The picture quality is very bad and the camera feels cheap compared to Canon and Fuji brands. This is a camera for poor people who can't afford a good brand. I would stick with a Japanese brand camera.
3,"I got my money's worth, I guess","IMHO, this was a pretty good camera for the time I've had it. The photos came out adequately clear.The only complaints I have are:1. it takes a long time between shots, which is really not a huge deal since I didn't miss too too many shots2. the picture quality becomes really blurry when you zoom in after a certain point (to get a bigger and better quality picture I just crop during editing)3. the screen goes black in low light where you have to guess and shoot4. it goes through batteries very quickly5. moving photos become a blurry mess in night scene mode6. after a while (about a year), the camera just would not come on at all unless I kept turning it off and on until it finally came on7. the flash causes the pictures to look grainy in low lightOverall, the camera wasn't terrible and I adjusted to its setbacks (e.g., carrying a lot of batteries, keeping the camera on, turning the flash off, etc.). I managed to get a lot of good shots in spite of."
2,Best used as a kid's camera,"Bought this as a gift for my parents. Was disappointed as soon as I got the camera in my hands.1) Very 'cheap' feel to it. Lightweight plastic body.2) Preview screen has very low resolution. I found the LCD screen to be difficult to use because of the low quality3) FIXED FOCUS. I completely missed that this camera has no optical zoom or auto-focus. Thus, every picture you take with the dig. zoom is bound to be fuzzy.The only plus I found is very easy-to-use controls."
1,"Poor performer- images, batteries, etc. & overpriced","This camera takes images with great color HOWEVER, the images are perhaps the WORST of any 2MP camera. They are grainy, noisy, poorly compressed (large files but poor quality). This camera also uses up 2-AA Batteries within about 35 shots- not good!Look elsewhere for a camera."
4,Great camera for the price,"I wanted a decent digital camera to keep in the car for a minimum cost and this one is the best buy I found. It is simple, takes good pictures, fits in a pocket and has some features that make it a pleasure to use. For Macintosh OS X users, if you download version 3 of the EasyShare software from Kodak's web site it is as good or better than Apple's iPhoto software and interfaces with the camera in unique ways. I am very happy with it, but highly recommend buying rechargeable batteries or buying Kodak's dock which comes with rechargeable batteries."
4,"Cheap, Simple, Camera","I got this camera in December and I am very satisfied with it. It's my first digital camera and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is inexperienced using them. It has very few options so there's not a whole lot you can do to mess up. The only reason why I deducted a star was because the batteries don't last very long (and aren't rechargeable); and because when taking pictures on their best quality setting the camera will only hold about eight. However, for what you pay for it, the Kodak Easy Share is definitely worth the money, and worth splurging $30 for a rechargeable battery."
3,Ok,"The camera is great, but the software is really annoying. If you have network it's terrible, you basically have to call customer service in order to get the software to work anyway. But overall the camera takes good pictures, after setup and installation it's easy to e-mail pictures."
3,Bare Bones Camera,"That's what it is. If that's what you want, then buy it. Mine didn't come with the sometimes-mentioned memory card. Got it day after Thanksgiving for $80, though. Photos look great on the computer screen (Sony 15"" LCD). Haven't seen prints.Problems are:* No carrying case or lens cover* Viewfinder is off significantly from the lens. About 20% of what I photograph is out of the viewfinder.No lens cap is just cheesy. There's no excuse for the latter. Hence the 3 stars."
2,Slow,"HP Pavillion A1730N is a joke! it is so SLOW, My old 256 GB XP is faster. The TEC.said I need one more GB to run as fast as my XP because the Vista has so many programs, Try it Before You Buy It."
3,HP 1730,"Machine lacks additional bay to add additional internal hard drive, the power supply is only 300 watts which means if you want to add anything you need to swap out the power supply. So make sure the machine has everything you need as this is not a machine that will allow you to grow it.One comment - had to call HP support - they were VERY GOOD."
3,Not too bad,I got this for $709. For that price a real good deal. Problem with all the bloatware installed. Once you get rid of all the junk not a bad machine at all.
1,STAY AWAY FROM HP DESKTOPS,"I paid over $1200.00 for an a1730n at Circuit City. Problems are as follow:1. Crashed continually2. Would not generate a recovery disk3. Circuit City wanted, I said wanted $30.00 for the disks (paper label)4. Hard drive failed, had to submit credit card to HP before replacement5. Then---the mother board failed and had to return the tower for repair6. Hours on the phone with tech support7. Expensive Lightscribe disks8. 'Settings save' will not save your settings9. Printer cartridges almost half price (1/3 the size)10. Want to talk about Vista? How about Circuit City?I worked for GE as a radar tech using HP equipment. How did they fall down on computers?Since I don't know if there's a good one out there. BUILD YOUR OWN."
2,a1760n,"HP has no (zero) useful support. Since I bought it, the screen I have seen most is the ""blue screen of death""! Not one iota of useful help from HP. I got the impression that their tech support ""experts"" are ignorant, arrogant, and both unwilling and unable to offer any help. Thank goodness, this computer is now out of warranty and I won't have to waste any more time with HP!"
5,Kodak 128 MB SD Card with case,I have used this same card in the past in my Kodak Easy Share Camera with excellent results. It is small and easy to carry as a spare so that you never have to worry about having enough film for your camera if you are on vacation or away from a store that carries this same card in case you are in need.
2,Heavy breathing,"I bought this CD after reading many reviews proclaiming it a definitive recording of Messiaen's quartet. However, after listening to the first few movements I found myself so distracted by the heavy breathing that punctuates nearly every violin phrase played that the music itself became difficult to concentrate on.Having since purchased a couple more recordings featuring him, I've discovered that this breathiness is a part of Gil Shaham's style that comes to the fore on smaller ensemble recordings -- sort of like pianist Glenn Gould's humming. Evidently most reviewers here weren't distracted enough by it to comment, but I found it intrusive enough during close listening to mar the listening experience. As a result, I rarely listen to this recording and usually go back to the 1975 Tashi recording on RCA."
2,This book was extremely complexed reading,"This book is a very old, text style, research paper from 1927. It is very difficult to read, and rather boring. It offers a lot of information that the reader can obtain in newer more interesting books. Don't waste your money, buy another book instead."
4,Maxi-C Complex,"This may be a higher dosage than most people need on a daily basis. I have mixed feelings about a 1000 mg dose but I haven't had any problems with it.This product is Vitamin C as ascorbic acid. It also, and this is important, has the citrus bioflavonoids from lemon, orange and grapefruit (more on that later) as well as Rutin and Hesperidin. Now this is just fine for me but because of my husband's medication restrictions, he does not get this one...grapefruit is contraindicated.I'm happy with this product. I take it with Vitamin E complex as they work well together. I prefer capsules to tablets whenever possible to avoid the other excipients. This one has a few anyway."
5,"Ingersoll-Rand (IR 244A) 1/2"" Super Duty Air Impact Wrench",I was a little disappointed this gun is now made in China but I guess thats how they keep the prices down.Impact seems fine.I am kind of old school and stay away from the composite guns.
2,nothing special,"This is just an ok grinder for light use. I brew coffee many times in a day, I am also somewhat picky about my coffee. I buy Intelligencia Coffee (here in Chgo.)and find that this grinder causes the grounds to stick to the bottom of the grinder and clump more.Does not hold enough beans(only 2 oz) for more than 6 cups, takes a longer time to grind than a couple of the other big brands. Also, the blades are not has heavy duty as others.I see it selling here for $10-THAT I would pay for this grinder, otherwise I'd move on to one of the Krups fast touch(for a few bucks more)- another blade type of grinder.Not the grinder for me."
3,OK Coffee Grinder,This grinder does the job for a small cost. It has some problems. It is messy to recover the last of the grounds after each use and then clean it. The cord is short and stiff. The manufacturer should provide a line clamp on the plug (wrap the line around the grinder and snap the plug to the line).SincerelyR. James
2,broke after 7 months!,"I got this product as a Christmas gift and by July, it stopped working. I guess it worked alright while it lasted, but I'm definitely getting a more expensive brand to replace it."
2,Not Happy,Inconvenient to clean and lid falls off to easily.Would be nicer if cord would store easier by rolling into cavity. :(
2,Not so great,"I bought this to grind grains, such as oats, flax, rice, etc. I just used it for the first time with oats, and it seemed underpowered ( at least as compared to the Krups grinder I used to have--I got water in it and was scared to use it again, which is why I bought this one). Also the lid didn't seem to want to sit on it properly. Wasn't snug at all, like my other coffee-type grinders. The oat powder got all over the outside of the grinder, I'm guessing because the lid wouldn't fit snuggly. Then when I tried to wipe it off, on an upstroke with a towel, the lid came off hit the floor and cracked. Nice for my first use. I think I'll return it."
4,Good Little Grinder,"Doesn't hold much, but that's okay. I just have fresh ground coffee every day. It does what it is supposed to do at a great price."
3,What I feel about this product,"I like it very much. I bought it specifically to grind linseeds, and it does all right for the most part. Just a few of them do not get grinded when I put in two spoonfuls. It is a good size and it works fast.I also used it to grind herbs. The thing is: it won't grind stems of the herbs, only the leaves. It won't grind anything that tough."
4,Good enough,"Have only used it a couple times for coffee beans and so far it works quite well. Simple, easy-to-use basic grinder is good enough for its purpose."
1,Waste of money,"This unit worked exactly 2 times before the blade broke. Then, it turns out the blade cannot be replaced so the entire unit must be returned to factory and replaced but they want a bill of sale which I can't seem to find. It might be the cheapest but in this case, you get what you pay for..."
2,Cheap but doesn't last,"The grinder worked decently well until it broke after 9 months.The grinder is loud. You have to shake it in order to get all the beans down into the blades for grinding. Besides that, it got the job done."
1,Not worth buying this grinder,"I purchased this product based on the feedback and seeing the price. However after using it for a month, it stopped working and now it cannot be returned to amazon. I dont know if I can get a replacement from the manufacturer, however the point is that a product going bad in a month time frame is not good even if its cheap.Also, it makes quite a loud noise and doesnt grind very fine. No option of multiple speed as well."
4,Good for the price,"I am satisfied with this coffee grinder. I bought it because the price was right and the reviews were mostly positive. So the bar wasn't that high. I don't love it, though. It's a litte messy and a little slow producing a fine grind.Would I buy it again? Yes, if price were a big factor."
4,Good coffee grinder,For the price this is a great little coffee grinder. I have used it also to chop nuts in. Works very well.
3,"good, not enough","It is a good. I need it for fine grain to espresso, it does not grind it fine enough."
4,good,It's nice and compact. I use it to grind up dry spices. Works perfectly. Have to admit haven't used it for coffee beans.
1,Plastic cracked and split,The plastic bowl on my grinder has split and is cracking into pieces. Otherwise it was OK. I'm replacing it with another brand.
1,Not good,"I use a french press and its impossible to get a decent ground, it produces everything from whole beans to superfine dust. The superfine dust gets in your cup and the whole beans it leaves is just a waste of money. Seems to me that the blades are just poorly designed.Save your money and buy something better."
5,Came in handy,The coffee grinder came in handy for my husband and his colleagues while deployed in austere conditions. I appreciate what you do for them and that you are willing to send items to them.
3,Ok but breaks easily,Ok grindFairly noisey. About the same as most blade grinders.Cup cleans out easily.Blade separated from motor shaft after two months of use. Unit is unusable.
4,Great price but makes a mess.,"This is my first grinder. It works great. But it does make a mess when you take the lid off, the coffee grounds stick to the inside of the lid. I do tap on the lid before removing it or if you only grind a few beans like I do, I just tip it upside down and take the beans out of the lid. Way less mess!"
2,Cheap but not satisfying!,"It is just Ok! Yes the price is cheap, but I would have opt for another brand with the difference of a few bucks. It doesn't have any setting for different levels of grinding (Like for espresso or other types. Other grinders with similar prices have this option). Coffee sticks to the container after being ground and it's a pain and mess taking the ground coffee out of it.I would not recommend it to a friend."
1,Use your blender instead!,"I bought this item to grind fresh coffee everyday. It makes such a mess that I only ground my coffee once a week. Eventually I went back to grinding the whole bag of coffee at the store. Once when I purchased two pounds of whole beans I decided to try the blender to do the job. It worked better than the coffee grinder! Less mess and less noise. I just used the high power grind setting. My blender is an old Hamilton Beach model with a glass pitcher. Save your money, just use your blender!"
5,Great Grinder. Just what I ordered.,Delivery was on time. The product works great for grinding flax seeds and coffee beans.
5,Toastmaster Coffee Grinder,"We bought this grinder to use to grind our flaxseed. It has worked well for us. I originally looked into a hand operated one and didn't find the reviews good. We are happy. One complaint I did read about this one was it was hard to clean. We just use a pastry brush to brush it out. Then every couple of times we use it, we wipe it out with a damp cloth. We like it!"
5,Works Very Well As A Flax Seed Grinder,"I was very skeptical when I read other reviews about how well the Toastmaster 1119 grinds Flax Seed. (I have a smaller coffee grinder and it just moves them around without even cracking the shells.) This machine grinds them into a powder with just a few pulses. I believe if it grinds flax seed, it should grind about anything (they are a very tough little seed). I highly recommend this spice/coffee grinder anyone."
1,This sucks.,"Here's why:- It's a huge pain to clean: none of the parts are removable, and it has tons of little crevices where stuff gets stuck, so you're reduced to rubbing it down with a wet paper towel (you can't submerge any part of it either). Additionally, the bowl inside isn't fixed so it spins when you try to wipe it, and unless you have super tiny fingers there's no way you can get the underside of the blades clean- you will have to get used to that paprika taste in your coffee if you intend to grind spices too- The contruction is terrible: I've had it a month and the button that turns it on is already going.Conclusion: Spend the extra $3 get something that isn't a piece of crap."
5,Great Buy Toastmaster Coffee and Spice Grinder,"I just received my Toastmater Coffee and Spice Grinder. It took about 4 days, but it was packaged well. I tried it immediately and liked the results. I read all the reviews previously prior to buying it. I'm very satisfied with my purchased. I bought it to grind flaxseeds (very small seeds) and was amazed at how it quickly grinded the seeds into powder. I can only image what it will do to larger coffee beans. The grinder to me wasn't loud at all and had a great pulse push button. I would like to say, I wish someone would have told me that when you order other items on Amazon.com there is a separate charge. I guess, because despite everything being listed on on website the items are being shipped from different locations. I noticed that in the last phase of the billing screen. Overall, very satisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm now a Happy Grinder!!!!!! (smile)"
3,basic.,"pretty basic coffee grinder. loud. grinds. spills coffee rinds all over the place. long white cord, which should have been retractable."
5,Good value,"This was a good price for this grinder and it's been good so far, after about 5 uses. No problems here for a first-timer. There were brief instructions on how to use it for grinding coffee and spices, if you are a first-timer too. That was handy."
5,Does the trick at a great price.,Don't spend more than you have to on a grinder. I have two of these (one at home and one at my current job location) and they both work great. The one at home has been in service now for about seven years with no hiccups. Recommend you shake the grinder as it is doing its thing so you can cycle all the beans through for a nice 'fine' grind. Great value.
2,"Sturdy, but messy","We've owned this for about 10 years and it's performed flawlessly. We use it almost exclusively for coffee and with a single power setting, it's all about timing when you want course or fine granules. Biggest complaint is that it leaves small bits of coffee grounds on the kitchen counter everytime we use it and remove the cover. It's such a mess that we're getting rid of it and buying a different model as we really like our fresh ground coffee."
1,Not worth it,"I used this about 10 times before the blade locked up and now will not spin. Even when it worked, you had to shake it while grinding so that it would get all of the beans, and you had to grind for a long time to get anything more than a very coarse grind. Yes, the price is cheap, but so is the quality. Not recommended at all. I will be trashing mine."
5,"Simple, straight-forward, does the job","I bought this grinder to replace my Braun grinder that died after 5+ years of use and abuse. I haven't had any problems with this Toastmaster grinder. It does the job I need it to do quickly, efficiently, and with little fuss."
3,Broke after one use.,"To be fair, I used this to crush frozen Skittles for my Skittles infused vodka, so I won't be so tough on it."
4,Buy This!,"If you are besieged with soliciters, as I was, you NEED this sign. It's attractive and effective. A friend liked it so much, she requested one for Christmas and after hanging it, three months later she has not had ONE soliciter. I would have given it five stars if it was a little larger, but it is still very effective, and not an eyesore as some signs are. It will work with whatever your exterior decor is."
3,"Nice Sign, But Slow Shipping & No Communication from Vendor","I just received this sign on 19 October, almost a month after I placed my order, it was supposed to arrive between 4 October and 12 October, and it hadn't been shipped on the 12th. I had to send 3 emails to Amazon and the vendor -- no one replied with the status. It's like they forgot about my order until I sent emails. I had the option to buy this exact sign elsewhere, and now, in hindsight, I wish I had. I will definitely be more careful about ordering from indirect vendors -- ordering direct from Amazon is a sure thing, but from a vendor is obviously not. The sign itself is more decorative than most ""no soliciting"" signs, and it seems to be of good quality, although on the small side. I was hoping it would be legible from the sidewalk, but it may not. Most frustrating has been the wait to receive it. And, shipping for this tiny sign via USPS is $6.95!"
2,"Attractive, but contains toxic chemicals","This is an attractive sign. I was very happy with it until I noticed the sticker on the back warning that the sign ""contains lead and/or cadmium chemicals""."
5,Magnificent Music,This cd is absolutely a must-have if you enjoy good music. It is very well produced and is one of those best kept secrets. We need to put it out there - give it more radio play. I heard a song from the cd on a local jazz station and fell in love. Kudos to J.Rawls!!
1,Where's the Meat?,"Well, this is a feel good Eastern Religion imbued book. It didn't really give me the tools I was looking for. I walked away feeling this was a book written for the author's own catharsis."
