3,tRIAL BY FURY,A very good read. A short tail which was enthrauling in parts. i realy enjoyed it. As an avid reader i would recomend this book for a bit of light reading.
1,"Really, really bad","I hate to diss all the readers who liked this one, but, wow! Just about the worst book I've ever read. Only way to get through it was to read it as a parody of the police procedural/female detective genre. Seemed to be written by a 12-year old boy. Never felt called to submit a review until this one, but just had to this time. Sorry, Mr. Kelter."
4,Good Read!!!,"This was a very good read!!!! Chalice reminds me of a stronger version of Boxer. She is more ""real"" than boxer and seems like a true female police officer would be. Anyone know which one is next in the series?"
3,Good,The book was good but I did not like the ending as much. Still well worth the money. Will purchase the other books in the series.
3,Don't Close Your Eyes ( Setephanie Chalice Mysteries #1,I enjoy Murder Mysteries but this one was just ok. Not a book that I could not put down. Slow reading but I have read many other better mysteries.
2,Scary title but borders on a romance novel,"While I have not finished reading this book yet, I can say that the main character spends more time describing how sexy she is instead of solving crimes. There is not one NY detective that would act the way she does so the storyline is not believable. There is some humor between her and her mother but the best thing about this book is the price."
2,Not a mystery,"I bought this book because (I admit it) I like books about cops who solve crimes. Mysteries, they're often called. This is not one of those books.Yes, there are a couple of murders committed early in the book. But after that the author and the heroine forget all about them and go off to pursue other lines of inquiry. Like who the heroine is sleeping with; who she would like to sleep with; what she thinks of her white, bearded therapist; what she thinks of her other hunky, black therapist; who her hairdresser is sleeping with; and her mother's diabetes. When I got to nearly half way through the book and this irrelevant crap did not seem about to stop, I just gave up and pressed hard on the cover and tapped 'Delete permanently'."
2,Don't close your Eyes,"I'm about a third way through and I don't know if I can hang in to find out 'who dun it'. The author, I had to recheck to confirm my belief that it is indeed a man, is putting words in the mouth of the heroine that no woman would use to describe herself. Too much time is spent on descriptive diatribe on everything but the story line. I have this compulsion to finish every book I start but this might just prove to be the exception to my rule."
1,One of the worst.,"I got this book after reading the positive reviews. I discounted the bad ones because there were so few. I should have listened to the bad ones. This is sitting in my kindle at 14% read. I can hardly bring myself to read the rest. Thank goodness it was cheap. This character is just too unbelievable. There are just too many sexual innuendos from her to even get into the plot of the story. She tries too hard to be a male detective and it just doesn't work. I read a lot of detective novels, usually one a week. I love TV shows like Criminal Minds. None of the good series, like the Prey series from John Sandford, the Lizzy Gardner series, or Alex Cross need to have these sexual remarks to get their point across. It makes for a poor plot and unlikable characters. If wanted to read trash novels I would read that category. I don't recommend this to anyone who likes a real detective/crime novel with good solid characters."
3,"Good Salsa, bad endings","This is a great sampler along with VOL.1,but what happens is that so many of thesesongs flow into the next track (on theartists album/CD) that they are cut off here andend abruptly, kind of ruining the naturalgroove and flow of the music."
3,Not quite getting where I wanted to go,"Maybe I caught the Salsa fever late, but I do know what I like. Although this album has some good sounds, I could never really lose myself in the sounds it created.Any good album should be like a good book; it should sweep you up completely until it drops you off on some cliff in the middle of nowhere, thirsting for MORE OF IT.Unfortunately, this music did not engender this effect. It would probably be great for background music for an upbeat party with a Latin theme, but for pure listening enjoyment, it did not do it for me."
5,What a handy tool,It is listed for sewing -but it is great for contruction. I converted a greyhound bus and it had lots of curves in it. i put tis unit in the curve and molded it to the curve and traced to a template. Worked great. SO if you have a lot of wacko curves to build in use this.
1,I think Lily should go back to graduate school.,I don't really get the sense that Lily has ever sat down to revise anything she's ever written; these stories are as underdeveloped as they are idiotic. Let us not spend any more bandwith on such a mind-numbingly boring topic.
2,Very hard to follow. Even harder to swallow.,"Lily James, in her debut anti-masterwork weaves a complicated, yet unsatisfying web of short post-feminist fictions in this slim volume. I found her characters to be too elusive to be interesting; too self-serving to be entertaining. Almost as much of a literary crime as her mentor Cris Mazza's seven egocentric, overblown works of ""faux art."""
1,BAD SERVICE,"I ordered this product SIX DAYS ago because my cat chokes very badly on fur balls due to his long puffy fur. It works well, and what's even better is that he LOVES the flavor. He acts like it's the best treat ever. However, I would NOT RECCOMEND BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY."
5,green beef tripe,"the tripe was absolutely disgusting smelling, and consequently my dog couldn't gobble it up fast enough! must be love....I have a 100 lb shepherd who LOVES the tripe product. And he is used to raw bones and raw meat, so by dog standards, it must be good stuff. I will buy more. How about a large volume better priced unit for us with big dogs?"
2,Beware of carageenan,"This product contains Carageenan. This ingredient is unsafe for animals. Do your own research. It seems harmless at first, (seaweed) however it is linked to stomach cancer and IBS in animals. Probably still a better alternative treat than all the other 'junk' on the market, but still not the best alternative."
3,Damaged cans,I was surprised to receive 4 damaged (popped) and therefore unusable cans in this shipment. This had never occurred previously.
2,a weak read,A really fascinating topic but a very disappointing read. I had high hopes for this one but found it written at about the 5th grade level. I don't know why Vern didn't write the book himself. He couldn't have done any worse than Freedman.
5,Wow!,"This video is an eyeopener and a must watch for anyone who cares about their heath.From ASL to chronic fatigue, Lyme can mask and mimic other chronic diseases.Please watch it and pass it along to all your friends and family....you may just save alife."
4,"Good, but very one-sided","I really enjoyed this movie and am truly glad that these people became well at the end. This movie was very one-sided though, it only followed people who have been successfully treated by doctors using long-term antibiotic treatment. After I read a few articles linked from the wikipedia page on lyme disease after watching the film, it became very clear that the other side also had a valid position - there isn't good clinical trial evidence to demonstrate the usefulness of long-term antibiotics, and since they produce antibiotic resistant bacteria this caused severe problems for some of the other (unfeatured in this documentary) patients.I would highly recommend seeing this film, as chronic lyme (and chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia as well) all deserve more coverage. But please, go read other sources from the other side afterward to get the full picture."
1,"Horrible film with horrible ""actors"" and filmography/music","I watched this film with my wife yesterday. I kept watching because it was laughable. Not because of the people who probably are suffering with some sort of disorder, but the filmography and the stupid music they kept playing over and over.. i also loved the random people like the chubby kid who was telling me how the tick bites and the infection is spread.. where the heck did he come from? I also like the random physicians they interviewed to support the ones doing unsupported treatments/tests. Just go to the CDC website and review their recommendations on Lyme. Most of all however, I loved the way that every person interviewed made physicians look evil! Laughable film!"
4,"Very, very interesting movie about lyme disease (both pro and con)","This is a very interesting movie about lyme disease, the neurological effects of this disease, and how this disease can affect those who contract it. There is a slight political edge to the movie in the sense that it highlights how many doctors and patients feel they are being ignored and told that what they have can't possibly be lyme disease and that it's all in their head. Those who heavily believe in lyme disease link it to Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc.Although the movie is more about those who support lyme disease and the theory that its effects are prevalent, I still feel ""Under Our Skin"" highlights the opposing side as well. Some doctors and all insurance agencies (it seems) consider this a very treatable disease but this movie made me think, are they wrong?"
5,died to young,"A dear friend since childhood passed away in June 2009 from having Lyme Disease.This DVD helped me to understand all that he went through, and I pray that it will be able to help others dealing with the same terrible illness. Doctors need to stop saying it is all in our heads, and actually DO something about what people are going through."
3,A few problems...,"I was excited to get so many loops, but there are a couple of things I'm disappointed with. First, none of the loops are software instrument loops, so they are not widely modifiable as far as tempo and key (you just can't push real instruments that far) although small changes are ok. Second, Zero-G's website says this includes 56 software instruments, but I cannot get these to install. They are not on the discs, but are available online as 15 separate files to download that are 30 megs or less each (makes no sense for a modern day internet connection). However, the downloads force you to use Stuffit Expander and seem to be missing I file. I've contacted tech support but heard nothing. It's a little frustrating to pay for quality recordings while being forced to deal with inferior delivery and support methods."
1,Disappointed,My camera prompted me to clean the video heads. Since I used this cleaner the camera has not worked properly.
3,not what i expected,"This is an unauthorized bio of R Kelly's life that contains very few interview excerpts (less than 2 mins worth) from the man himself. Although very detailed, if you have followed R's career closely, this CD will probably not inform you of many facts you didn't already know. I recommend this CD for anyone that knows the music, but not the man. I'd have to say the best part about this CD is the mini poster."
1,Terrible Product,You pay for what you get and you get nothing that works with this device. I bought it and then had to buy a Belkin Soho switch to actually work. I fought with this one trying to get it to work for a month and could not return the product due to the 30 return limit. Don't bother!
2,KVM switch,"This switch worked fine, however it took up too much room on my desk and difficult to access. It needs a large work area to function properly. Had to replace as soon as I received it. Will save it for emergency use."
1,Failed to work; no signal on monitor,"Purchased one, hooked it up per manuf directions. No signal on the monitor. Returned it thinking it was DOA and got a replacement. Same experience. Running Windows XP SP2 (Home version) on both computers (HP and Compaq). I WILL BE PURCHASING A DIFFERENT BRAND TOMORROW."
3,Work for most of PC desktop but the Dell Laptop Docking station!!!,"This does not work with my Dell docking Station. When I hook up the mouse and the keyboard directly to Dell laptop docking station, they work perfectly. However hook up thru Trendnet, the mouse never works. I have tried with different ports of TRENDnet and differnt mouses, just to waste my time.The good thing is it works with 3 Desktop PC I have. I work on my Dell Laptop most of the time, so it is not a good use for me. I just printed the return label from Amazon. You should buy thru Amazon only so that the returning is a pleasure experience. Atleast we don't need additional hassle after the stress of trying to get the item working properly.TRENDnet should test their product with ps/2 mouse/keyboard on laptop docking station..."
1,"Not an easy ""plug and Play"" as professed","Trendnet TK208K 2-Port PS/2 Audio KVM SwitchReturned the first switch because the switch would not function. Amazon was fantastic and sent a replacement overnight at ""No Charge"". I have been trying to get the second switch to work for a couple of weeks. TRENDnet help (a technician in a foriegn country working from a script) finally has asked me to idenitfy the motherboards of both computers. This willl require me to get inside and that is just not practical, certainly not ""Plug and Play"" I am returning the unit for a refund."
1,TK-408 Mouse/Keyboard lose signal + screen flicker,"I've been using KVM for many years. I was happy to see the TrendNet tk-408 offered for such a good price... However it was to good to be true. I got a macintosh and a PC machine to work ok, however when I boot the PC on Linux the screen flickers ""until warm"". I'm not sure why, but the first 10 minutes the screen is on it keeps flickering away. NO, its not the monitor, if the monitor is connected to ""the other"" KVM (ps2), this does not happen. It may be some sort of USB power issue... Anyhow, its hard to get a hold of support at Trendnet...Still struggling here..."
4,Trendnet 4 Port PS/2 KVM Switch w/Audio,"I have been using the Trendnet 4 port PS/2 KVM for several weeks and I am very satisfied with the way it works and the quality, for the price I paid. It has performed as advertised, I have not experienced any problems to date. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality KVM Switch that includes the necessary cables. Remember you will need approximately an 18-24 inch diameter circle of space for the switch and associated cables when connected."
1,Does not work with my new HP PC,"The KVM doesn't work with my new HP DC7100 PC. The keyboard and mouse is not recognized by the BIOS (I can't press F10 to get into the BIOS setup, for instance). I swapped cables/ports/etc. and it is KVM speaking to the HP PC. The KVM works fine with my 8 year old PC. I reflashed the HP PC's BIOS with the latest, no change.You can't reflash firmware on this KVM.Repeated emails to Trendnet customer support were unanswered, so I called their support folks. Plesant enough, but the bottom line was to give me an RMA to return the product to Trendnet with no clear solution.I guess I need to by a more ""robust"" KVM."
1,There are better KVM devices out there!,"I tried this piece of junk to hook up my Windows 98 computer and my Windows XP computer to the same monitor, keyboard and mouse. I could never get a signal on the monitor. Then I bought a similar device from D-Link (item # KVM-121 - 2-Port KVM Switch with Audio) which was cheaper and worked like a charm. Don't waste your money on Trendnet, get the D-link device. You will be much happier."
3,You get what you pay for,This is only an OK product. Spend the extra bucks and buy quality. It will make a difference in two years.
4,A good general purpose watch oil,"This is a quality product that can be used where ever there is a need for watch oil of medium viscosity. It is neither heavy enough to use as grease or light enough for the really delicate pivots and jewels, but is great to fill the most common needs I encounter."
5,Bisacodyl,This is a very good deal. The cost for 1000 tablest si not much more than what you pay for 100 tablets at any store.
1,Questions,"I was surprised when I received the Biscodyl how they looked: they were really tiny, yellow-ish colored, and marked with ISU 003. I was a little hesitant to try them because they were no where marked Biscodyl, Bis, or even 5 mg. I have ordered Equate's Women's laxative in the past which were also 5mg. tablets, and they were considerably larger than the Biscodyl. I am actually questioning the legitimacy and safety of these tablets. Have anyone used these before and got actual results? Please inform me if you have. I am scared to try them. . ."
5,Life lessons for kids of all ages,"My kids love all the Horseland dvds. But I really just wanted to post the list of episodes included on this dvd since I couldn't find the list before I bought it. I was worried it was a compilation of the previous dvds, which it is not. 10 Episodes: 1) The Secret, 2) The Newbies, 3) A New Development, 4) New Pup in Town, 5) A Horse Named River, 6) The Last Drop, 7) No News is Good News, 8) Talk, Talk, 9) Oh, Baby, 10) Heritage Days. Total running time: 4 hours."
3,Not a movie! Episodes.,"I purchased this under the impression that it was a movie but it is merely a few of the episodes from the series. For the price of this DVD I was able to purchase the entire complete series of Horseland so these episodes are duplicate. I would recommend buyig the ""complete series"" DVD to save yourself some money. Fabulous series for kids!"
4,A Classic!,"This is a great starter cookbook. It's instructions are simple, it has great photos and it goes the extra mile by giving useful extras such as substitute ingredients and measurement assistance."
3,Not hardbound,The description says hardcover however it is a 3 ring binder with a hardcover. I was disappointed. Will give it to Mom with an apology and go to Barnes and Noble for what I thought I was getting.
3,Needs more power,I look at this as a toy due to the cheap plastic case and very dim light output. It does what it says and looks quite neat but it isnt for anyone who does DJing....any LED lights of today would overpower the laser and you would not see it.
3,Could've been better.,"It's a very clever idea - every page shows the handsign for the letter, and a picture of an animal. (Sometimes, as with B, we get two animals - bear and bee.) I firmly believe that using signs and the manual alphabet helps to reinforce literacy skills.But some of the animals are a little obscure - like the nautilus or the urchin - and the names aren't printed on the pages. You have to flip back to the index. That makes reading the book with a young child awkward. Also, I would really have liked to have seen - even in the index - a list of signs for the animals themselves."
1,Never received book,Never received this book. Contacted seller and asked for money back and never received.
3,Not top quality,I bought these because they were cheap. about 1 in 7 snap as i'm wrapping them around the cords i bought them for. the ratio is good enough to match the price that i would buy them again.
4,Great price for a nice pen,"I was looking for a nice but not overly expensive fountain pen to draw with... this has turned out to be my new favorite and go to pen.. nice weight, and I LOVE the refillable ink cartridge!"
5,"Don't hesitate, this is what your looking for.","Matthews have always been a quality name to me, but this is more than a name, these are simply awesome. They are very heavy duty and will be with you for years. Two main things I look for in camera gear: Does it do the job I need? Will it hold up long-term doing that job? Absolutely to both questions. Aside for a few fancy lenses that I love to gush about, this is my favorite piece of equipment.To be noted: older style c-stands had an interesting locking mechanism at the bottom that usually involved a person flipping the stand upside down and wrestling to get all the feet aligned to proper early break down. Not anymore. Matthews has a new style that eliminates the need to manhandle your gear in order to put it away. Hard to describe what it looks like, but it's much easier. No fuss, easy up and easy down. +1 for Matthews."
3,Virgin Beauty,"I love Ornette's music but in my opinon the ""electric period"" is not his best.These tunes belong to this period and sometime the music looks obsessive and maybe that's what He wants. Anyway this cd is a part of Ornette music and it is a good reason to buy it. Finally the recording quality is very very high."
5,Makes me realize how fortunate I am,"This is an excellent book. It woke me up to the importance of having people in your life. I am not a particularly outgoing person by nature, but after having read the book, I realized I already had a group of people around me that I can call my ""personal village"". The book made me realize how lucky I am to have these people in my life and to try harder to maintain these friendships, but also to be open to making connections with new people."
4,OUr biggest social problem,"Here is an easy ro read well thought out book on the biggest social issue facing us today-- personal isolation, which breeds fear, suspicion and alienation. This is not a socialogical study but a nuts and bolts book about the problem and workable, inaginative solutions. There is a good annotated bibliography at the end of each chapter that adds to the book's value. Easy and to the point prose offers suggestions to put into practice today. Isolalation left to spread within your life or society is another form of anniliation.John, author of Reading Thomas Merton."
1,what could go wrong?,"here's what: Sentry buys Petromalt and changes the formula from malt to corn syrup and makes the product runny. My cats have loved the old formula and this new cheap stuff isn't going to be bothered with. A great product goes down the tubes because of simple corporate, dare I say? stupidity. Go ahead and try this stuff, but cat owners all over the web say you would be wasting your time on this junk product. This is sad."
5,Best 1 ton arbor I've seen,"Includes three arbor punches/bits where others don't. The ram is counterbored and a magnet glued into the bore to accept and hold the bits. Nice touch. Remember if you make your own punches to not let them bottom out on the magnet, sinceand magnets are brittle.As arrived, this press came with a wheel handle on it opposite the bar handle. See the 1/2 ton press for a picture. It was an unexpected surprise, but I find I never use that wheel handle.Overall, a great little press."
5,Great,Met all my expectations and I need sixteen more words so here thry are plus some additional just to them.
3,It's OK and just OK... No biggie,"The whole stage setup, the lighting and the camera/video quality is not as good as Tiesto's setups.Tiesto is still the best, say no more."
1,Forget it,"I thought this was going to be funny, but it was quite possibly the worst book ever. I feel dumber having watsed time to read the 15 pages I did!"
1,But I love fried chicken!,"I have never seen such a worthless book. Nothing could be more wrong than this book. Because it was so bad, I think I'm gonna become a Clemson fan and go buy ""I Hate South Carolina""!"
2,Intimidating,"After reading all the great reviews about this book I ordered it to begin preparing for the quantitaive section of the GRE's but I was in for a nasty shock after opening the first chapter! This book might be concise and well written however it's only for the well versed in math and not those who did the bare minimum since college or high school. This prep book assumes you know all the basics and takes off from there, however going through this book for someone like me is like studying latin, it makes no sense! Do yourself a favor start out with a book that prepares you from the BASICS and use this once you're thorough with your fundamentals, it'll save you time, money and a lot of anxeity."
3,good for refresh. but CURRENT ACUTAL GRE is MUCH harder,"I reviewed this book more than 3 times before the exam.After that, I felt somewhat confident about the exam.but actual exam I took today(4/2, 2005) showed thatthe real exam is much much harder than this well -writenpractice book. Some advanced topic, topology,real anaylsis,abstract algrebra is way way hard. You better review or study with actual textbook.DON'T prepare for the exam with ONLY THIS BOOK."
5,Before you leave a review - please note!,This is NOT a book about the quantitative section of the general GRE! It is a book for those taking the MATH SUBJECT TEST for the GRE. Leaving a bad score for this book because you are confused about this issue is not fair to the author/publisher of this book.
2,As expected but not great,"It works as expected, shows the G-forces. But...It does not show the peak, which is a big issue. When I am driving I am going to be looking at the road and not at the meter and it is continuously changing so doesn't make sense to to store and display peak values later. If I would have known this I would not have bought this. I thought it would be a given, who is going to be looking at this continuously when driving and to what purpose.the other issue is cheap build quality, the right buttons are sticky and don't function well.Overall a cheap product with limited functionality."
5,9 months and going strong,"Well I have not had any problems like the other reviewers have had for this monitor. I picked mine up at BestBuy for $199 and think it is a great monitor. If I wanted an LCD to match this performance then I would have to spend at least 3x as much. This monitor works great for gaming with its UltraBrite mode. I upgraded from an 17"" monitor and this just feels huge."
5,AWESOME!,"I recieved this monitor for a graduation present from high school. I am currently in my Junior year of college and I haven't had a singe problem with it. On top of that, my parents have a model before this one and it yet to mess up on them. I can't say anything about customer support, but I haven't had a single problem with the monitor yet."
3,"Nice screen, but slightly distorted geometrics","This monitor has good specs for the money. And in the past, I've had good experiences with ViewSonic products.However, as soon as I connected and calibrated this monitor, I noticed that all horizontal lines ""bowed"" in the middle. The top bar of a window was noticably curved.I know flat-screen CRTs have some issues with showing accurate geometrics, and the curve I saw may have been tolerable to some. However, to me it was unusable. Returned the monitor and bought a smaller (but straight!) LCD."
4,"Bradbury, A Medicine For Melancholy And Other Stories","Ray Bradbury's A Medicine For Melancholy collection was a pleasant surprise after reading several horrible books in a row. This collection is full of stories that are sometimes scary, sometimes sad, and sometimes puzzling to the emotions. Most of the stories in this volume impressed me, even the ones that talked about rockets and Mars, which seemed to be every other one. A few of them are incredibly memorable like The Wonderful Ice-Cream Suit because of its erie but comical quality. I also loved All Summer In A Day which is an imaginative and impossible story about a small girl's huge disappointment on the planet Venus. The Town Where No One Got Off is yet another memorable story that made me wonder what would happen if I just got off the train at a town in the middle of no where without telling anyone. Great collection with very few duds in the mix."
5,OMG. It is GREAT!!!,"If you are going to Atlanta this is very helpful for gays and lesbians. It is a super handy size, fun to read and has great tips. It is very easy to use so when you are in the car it isn't hard to find what you are looking for."
3,Good for one-hour videos,"No problems when the video length is about an hour. However, my experience from the previous batch of 50 Philips DVDs has shown that if I use the entire DVD, one out of three discs have errors. For two-hour videos I recommend Sony."
1,Thoughtless packaging,"wed, Nov 14, 2012Order ID 105-7464609-1677023My cylinder of dvd discs was open, with a broken spindle and broken seal tabs. This was the result of putting a heavy item like this into a lightweight long box holding the Unger pick-up tool without properly securing it. The heavy cylinder obviously rolled around and hit every bump until it broke open, spilling the discs all over the large box. DVD packaging is tough, so it has to have taken heavy impact to break the seals. Now I can't be sure which, if any, of the discs are still usable. This is unprofessional. I expect better from Amazon. And I expect a reply."
4,PHILIPS DVD+R 16X 100-SPINDLE,"DVDs worked well in my duplicator, with only one or two cousters, out of the 100 in the spool. Which I consider good, compared with other brands I have boughten. This is the second spool I have bought, and I will buy again, when these are gone. Disks are well packaged, and protected from damage on there spool. Marketed at a fair price."
5,will purchase again,"Personally, we like to use Amazon.com brand but, we waited too long on restocking and ordered Philips instead. Philips worked just as well and we were satisfied..."
1,don't fall for the Brand name,"4 out of the 12 DVDs that i have burned have failed. Should have stayed with the off brands, can't remember the last time they failed."
1,These are the Worst of The Worst,"Take my word for it here. These are the WORST of the WORST of all DVD media out there. If you like making coasters, than go for it. They sell these at our local ABC Warehouse at an incredible discounted price because they are JUNK. What is funny is that their CD-R's are fine. Never have any problem with them Can't quite figure that one out. But their DVD media is MUST to avoid. Let me suggest, Sony, Memorex, HP, or Ridata."
2,Philips DVD +R,"When I received the DVDS the inside spindle rod was broke in half , I have had 11 of the DVDs so far ,still have about 50 more left to write ,to have a defect on the edge where they are coming apart they will not write with this defect. The DVDs seam to separate into 2 discs"
1,Many of these could not be written,5 of the first 10 failed to write. We did not try the rest and returned it immediately. Memorex worked fine in the past.
4,Gawd awful!!!,"Yes, it was gawd awful and that's why it was so good. If the picnic love song doesn't have you on the floor laughing then you are probably a hopeless Earth human. Also, hiding behind the bush during the nuclear explosion was a nice touch plus don't forget the molded jello served with the coffee. Nothing great but who's expecting that anyway........"
1,A silly spoof,"This is a spoof of a 1950's SciFi B-movie. Unfortunately it is so silly that it fails miserably. Think of an even sillier movie than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but without the charm. Sci B-movies usually had some logic to their plots, but this has none and is more like a pastiche of pieces, rather like Roger Corman's early efforts re-composing Russian sci fi movies. The cliches are all there - a mars populated only by women, a mad scientist with a doomsday weapon, mad generals and shoot first, ask questions later cops.Don't bother with this movie and watch something else. If you do watch this, you will want your 80 minutes back."
3,This one is really a fake old timie movie.,"They shot it with a new fangled digital camera and used proprietary software to give it that old time patina of black and white with all the lines and scratches of time. They went out of their way to use not so steady framing and placed obscure cuts to give the feeling that it was spliced one too many times.The film its self was made on a very budget over a very long time. They filmed in all the correct vantage sci-fi locations and had to sneak in as they did not get permits.It may have been a tad campy but it had a better message than ""the day the earth stood still."
2,Where's the beef?,"This book is basically a bunch of pictures of LA's official historic landmarks. At the intro to each neighborhood, there is a brief write-up (1/2-3/4 page) on ALL off the landmarks in that area. A sentence or two on a FEW of the sites just doesn't cut it. To top it off, the print/paper quality is not very good. I'm sorry to say, it's simply disappointing."
5,It's not fair!,"CBS wouldn't know what a ""great"" series was if it jumped up and bit them on the behind! How they could ever possibly take this wonderful show off the air is still a mystery to me. The pilot episode started everything off with a tremendous BANG and by the last few episodes of the second season, the chemistry and special magic between the cast, combined with the wonderful scripts and stories and great action sequences made this a truly unique and magnificent series. It's a shame that studio executives don't listen to the fans more often when we tell them what we want to see coming across our TV sets. Personally, I hope that MGM releases the remainder of the episodes on videotape so that I can spend long hours enjoying the episodes over and over again because nothing else on television is even worth watching these days. Long may the Seven Ride!"
2,A big disapointment,"The original Magnificent Seven is my favorite. It is one of the best westerns ever made. I was looking something similar, but that is not possible. The time has its effects. We ar now much more cynical - at least pretend to be. The basic ingredients are there, but it just does not work for me. Its too messy, noisy and violent and the Seven are not interesting as persons. It is hard to understand, what those who like it, are seeing. My only consolation that the Finnish paper I read gave it exactly the same rating. So, if there are Finns or Scandinavians, do not buy it. It's not for your mentality. If you think, like me that best westerns were made 1940's and 1950's, do not buy it."
1,What Production Value?,"Give me a break! I just watched the original and this remake back-to-back. This version doesn't even come close to the original. The character development in this remake is almost non-existant. The dialog is stiff and scripted. Acting is rigid and chiche. Some of the wide angle camera work reminds me of soap-opera cinematography. I am not usually so harsh, but I am astounded by all the 5 star reviews! Am I missing something here? If you like brainless action and formula films, then this flick is for you. If you are a thinking person who appreciates the fine art of film, then don't waste your time."
2,The Magnificent Seven isn't Magnificent,"This was a poor remake of a classic cowboy film. The mediocre actors of this movie are a dull shadow of the all-star cast of the original movie. The villains were weak, the plot was nearly non-existant. Mike Beihn is a good actor and plays a good cowboy (Tombstone) but he does not have the presence of Yule Brenner. There is a long boring spell ended by wild and undirected gunplay.Overall, this was not exatly a remake but a different movie based on the oldie but goodie. This was not a terrible film but it will never be a classic."
5,A Magnificent Tribute,"This television series' pilot mirrors the Yul Brenner movie but has more heart and direction. With a fantastic cast featuring Michael Biehn (Aliens), Dale Midkiff (Time Trax) and Eric Close (Now and Again), this movie has got your full attention the moment you swing through the saloon doors. The pace is keep at a fast gallop, introducing characters and their personalities with ease and style and moving right along to more action. Here's my final round up of my review: the lines are good, the plot is strong and the air is filled with gunfire. What more could you ask of a western!witty@epix.net"
2,Works well for a while,"This sunshade fit great when I first got it. It has shrunk a little and that makes it curl up on the left and right edges. It does make a huge difference in the temp of my car, but I bought it because I wanted a snug ""Custom"" fit. Might as well go with a cheap accordion version and cut it yourself."
3,Ran into problems,"I'm ~1600 rated player and I ran into problems using this book. Mainly that there aren't enough games to study for each variation. Studying 2 or 3 games for a key variation of an opening does not leave me feeling comfortable that I can handle it in play. I think most club players would feel the same way as well. Studying 60 or so games of the Queens Gambit Accepted alone, for example, is probably more beneficial than getting a little introduction to the very numerous and disparate openings bunched into the category of ""Queens Gambit.""Unlike most books with master/grandmaster games white always wins in the games annotated here. A good number of the games show white coming out of an opening with an advantage, and then using technique to convert this to a win. Advantages and disadvantages to this compared to a collection of annotated games where the positions are not as noticeably imbalanced."
3,Tales of King Arthur,"The books were received in a timely manner. I was expecting a different size book than the one I received. The one I thought I was ordering was also a paperback, but was not novel size. The book does have the exact same stories so I was able to use it in my classroom. It does not have the fabulous pictures that the other book had."
4,I love cutting cheese!,"Cute modern design, perfect size for all types of cheese cutting. Only complaint is that the stainless steel gets waters pots but I bought stainless steel cleaner that works like a charm. I highly recommend these little cuties!"
2,Blunt Edges,"Nice looking cheese knives, but the edges were blunt as if they had not been finished at the factory. Firm cheeses like cheddar were mangled not sliced. I used a bench grinder to put an edge on the knives, but that is never as good as a factory edge. Bed Bath and Beyond has a comparable set for a lower price and they come with edges sharp enough to cut cheese."
3,Case Accomodates the Open Phone,"I'd like to correct a misconception of one of the previous reviewers. The case is like a bookcover, and each side of the open phone slips into it. So, you are fully capable of using the phone open or closed without removing the phone from the case. However, it is a rather tight fit, and there are a few spots where there is some puckering of the plastic, leading me to believe it will break in time. However, if we get some use of the cases and they protect the phone for a while, then I am all for it, considering I did primarily purchase the set for the car charger."
3,get what you pay for,"For $10, buy this for the car charger and hands-free thing. Throw the phone cover in the trash or feed it to your dog, as that's all this cover is good for."
1,this value pack is no value!!,"the charger is fine, and the ear bud marginal, but the case is AWFUL. it doesn't even fit on the phone."
1,Makes no sense,"This product is crap. Why would you have a fitted cover for a flip open product like this. This is a generic product for LG phones. Since most of the features require the phone to be open, the leather case is silly.Buyers beware."
1,Not worth the money.,"I saw this in a magazine and searched for a better price, which I found on Amazon. This stuff worked to melt the ice that was on my driveway, but did not live up to the ""lasts for 2 weeks"" ad. I have a 3 car garage and a driveway to match. I used the entire bottle on the driveway the first day before snow was perdicted. We only had an inch of snow and this did not work as advertised. I still had to shovel the driveway. Plus as a bonus I now have a nasty dark stain all over the concrete. The manufacturer said the stain will wash away with ""time"". I will not be ordering this again."
4,Works OK,Keeps snow from packing down and sticking but you still need to shovel or sweep to remove al but very small amounts. Needs to be applied 1 to 2 hours before the snow ideally.
1,Not worth the expense,"Tried this in a snow storm and then an ice storm. Pretty much useless. I followed the instructions very carefully, laid it down 30 minutes before the storm hit and made sure I did not underspray. It is supposed to cover 1,000 sq ft, and that is the area I stuck to when spraying. Perhaps putting more solution down might have helped. If so, then it becomes way too expensive to justify."
1,Is this a joke?,"I used the product as directed. The sprayer worked very slowly and no matter which way I turned the nozzle, it just trickled out in streams. I used most of the product (before I got tired and cold) and it barely covered my 50 feet of sidewalk. The driveway was not even a consideration at that point. I still had ice and snow accumulate on the sidewalk and had to apply salt after I shoveled. Not the miracle product I was led to believe it would be."
4,Gets the job done,"I don't think there is a product available that completely eliminates the need to shovel snow, but this product makes shoveling less back breaking. I applied Bare Ground after I shovelled my driveway and sidewalk and it helped to prevent the additional snowfall from sticking to the ground. Round 2 of shoveling went much smoother and quicker. Be careful if you are applying it when the temperature is above freezing - the sprayed area could become slippery."
2,Not what I expected,"This product didn't seem to work very well. I sprayed in before the snow storm came and it only worked for maybe an hour. The tempeture of the storm was only around 30 degrees (well above the -20 degrees the product says it can work in), and the storm only produced maybe an inch of snow."
1,Never got product worst shopping experience ever.,"Website screwed up, multiple orders cancelled. hope it got fixed. Baaaad. tried to order three times all with different problems."
3,Helps somewhat,"Product does help prevent ice buildup. Especially helpful on steps. Nothing, however, keeps 4""-6"" of snow off the sidewalk. Removing the snow is a bit easier."
4,Excellent First Novel,"Liked it a lot. A real page-turner with developed characters and lots of action and atmosphere. Pardon the cliche but, you really don't have to be Italian to like this book, with its varied generational view of familial ties and obligations,the mob and growing up Italian. If you have fond memories of Brooklyn (and who doesn't), this is a great read. Excellent first novel."
5,Evocative and brave and fun to read,"This first novel-- remarkably smooth, engaging and well-structured for a first novel-- evokes a time that no longer exists and tells a story of what it was like growing up in the tightly insular ethnic neighborhoods of New York, and the pains and difficulties of leaving those neighborhoods and the life you led for another, quite incompatible life. It is a brave book, too, because it does not hesitate to reveal some very private places and because it shows how long and unbreakable the cultural umbilical cord can be. It is also-- again remarkable for a first novel- a gripping mystery on several levels at once, with all the loose ends credibly tied together by the time the book ends. And oh yes, it was fun to read, no small thing. The characters are interesting, unique, real and believable and the ethnic food scenes alone are worth the price of admission."
4,A New York State of Mind,"If you like NYC politics, the Mafia, food, ethnic tensions, love and sex, then this is the book for you. Using a Law and Order-style of bringing in contemporary events to tell a story, the author explores some timeless themes-the difficulty of transcending one's past and the redemptive power of love. He plunges you right in and doesn't let you come up for air until the end. His Mafioso are less angry and violent than The Sopranos but they love their food and there is always that hint of menace."
2,Um. Terrible.,"Without going on too much about it -- this novel was a complete bore. I'm Italian. From Bensonhurst. Was looking forward to this read. Completely disappointing. Predictable. Corny. The sex scenes in the book were completely ridiculous and laughable. It has some moments, particularly the main characters dialouge and persona; but there's not even close to enough being there to save this from being a big diappointment. How it received these 4-5 star reviews, I have no idea."
4,A real period piece,"The author portrays an honest flavor of a place and time that can only be remembered now. It's Brooklyn character at it's best. The author's sincerity comes through as he evokes a time, place, and story that ring true. Great characters and engrossing tale."
4,"Not a great singer, but a great single!","I must be honest here. This girl isn't much of a vocalist, but she obviously knows a hit single when she sees it. Her tone is pleasant enough, but her voice isn't what is so attention grabbing about this single. The overall rhythm of this song is insanely infectious, not to mention highly addictive. Normally I can't stand listening to music that contains pitchy vocals, but somehow Lumidee makes this song fun to listen to.This cd-single in particular contains 4 tracks: The original album version, 2 club mixes, and a Spanish version that, oddly, makes Lumidee's fairly limited voice sound better than in English. The fluidness of the Spanish lyrics seem to give Lumidee's voice a much needed boost.From what I've heard, this song is the only one worth listening to from Lumidee's debut album ""Almost Famous."" So, will Lumidee be a one hit wonder? Quite possibly yes. Regardless, I still enjoy this single and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys catchy, breezy pop-R&B."
5,Great Song!,"Lumidee may not be a great singer, but she is doing it way big with the Never Leave song. Actually, she has a nice voice. It is just she knows her limits. This song is playing everywhere and the beat is a killer. The haters got to admit, this is a hit song and it will always be remembered."
3,One hit wonder but good,"Lumidee's ""never leave you"" has been played for a long time now, it's that kind of song that is simple and you can dance too. The version with Busta Rhymes and Fabolous is without a doubt the best. Even if Lumidee's voice is limited the single works fine and it's pretty good too but i doubt that her second single will be any hit."
5,Powerful and clear,"The sound from this speaker system is impressive. It delivers clean powerful bass, full midrange, and clear highs. I usually lean towards larger systems, but I decided to buy this as a gift for my parents and was blown away. Starting to wonder if I should have given them my system and kept this one for myself."
4,Very good for its price,"I bought this speaker system recently and am using it with a YAMAHA V2700 reciever. It is a 7.1 channel reciever but I am using only 5 speakers and it works just great. Very reasonable for the price. The speakers looks very small, but they give very good sound. We love them."
3,"Good bass, the little speakers are weak in mid range",The bass box is good. The little speakers are to small too produce a good mid range sound. The wall brackets were easy to mount and the speakers look good.
4,5.1 yamaha speakers,I did alot of research before purchasing my system and I'm happy to say it paid off. These speakers deliver a very good sound and for a very good price relative to other comparable systems. I certainly recommend them to anyone on a budget who wants quality and expandability. You can purchase two more satellites to convert to 7.1.
5,Fantastic!,"We bought these speakers because of the great reviews we read here, and on Consumer Reports. These speakers measured up! They look good, and sound even better. What a great product for a fair price. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Fine,"It can be a great movie or okay movie. If you really know a lot about the Romanov family like me, it was boring, but if you are just starting out it is great movie."
3,Don't waste your money...,"$22 for a 50-minute documentary from A&E; is unreasonable...it certainly isn't worth $15, much less $25... If you buy the movie Anastasia (1956) with Ingrid Bergman (for $11.99) you get this documentary for free in the special features, plus a decent movie.Why the documentary television networks think they need to overprice their stuff above the cost of full length feature-film DVDs is beyond me, but until they learn, do yourself a favor and buy this video as part of the Anastasia movie DVD.Like the other commenters have said, this documentary is less on Anastasia Romanov and more on the controversy of Anna Anderson and the controversy."
5,Worth the Money,"A 1st grader could use this product, it is so simple to install and use. It proved to be a simple and inexpensive way to allow our PC to access the same wireless router that our laptops do. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple, inexpensive way to access your wireless router."
5,This Bag is made for Heavy hauling,"The 5577 Expedition is well named. You could go on an expedition with this bag and feel very secure that your gear would be protected. This is not a small bag and will carry just about everything you would ever need. Be prepared though, once it is packed it is a load. More than enough room for my equipment. Very rugged. Very well padded at the shoulder harness and lumbar areas. Very Nice accessory pockets. With the MAS system you can even add more attachments to carry more. I would highly recommend!"
4,Very nice photo backpack,"I was upgrading from a smaller microtrekker bag because it wouldn't hold the longer zoom lens I recently purchased. The Expedition 7 bag is plenty big (too big?) for lots of gear, accessories, etc. It isn't a light bag (weighs roughly 6 pounds with nothing in it) but it has great shoulder and back support and comfort. I'm using it now for my camera gear as well as a camcorder. I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Good,Wife liked the surprise she loves snowman. Filled her stocking up and she enjoyed lokking through everything on Christmas morning.
1,Didn't get what i ordered,I ordered snowman stocking stuffers and got another item a stacked snowman with cheaper candy not a gift for a 10 year old....
1,Ovation does NOT work with Vista/2007!,"...and Adobe has NO plans whatsoever to upgrade it so that it does. That's a real shame, too, because Ovation was a genuinely outstanding product before Adobe bought it and then completely abandoned it."
4,Great product until purchased by Adobe,"I would buy this but for the other reviewers comments on compatibility. I LOVED this product. Even with it being so memory intensive (it took a ton of memory to use and often could not be emailed due to data restrictions). But the graphics were just fantastic and unique. I am always looking for new and interesting graphics and flash to put into presentations and this did it! People came up after and said they not only liked the presentation, but wanted to know how I did it!Once Adobe bought it, they gave it no support and dropped it. They didn't even replace it with a comparable product. Nothing."
4,"Great educational tool, great price","I bought this because the bears alone make the price a value. They are sold separately for about the same price. They can be used for so many things: matching, sorting, counting, basic math, etc. Add the scale to demonstrate greater than/less than/equal concepts, and science concepts, this is a great tool! Love it."
1,Garbage,"Since i havent heard this cd, im not gonna say anything about it but if its anything like Prayer under pressure then its total garbage, Rap-metal is starting to die out and this band is going with it, You could pretty much call them an Otep clone but the sound quality isnt as good and Otep is a better band, Let it Rain is their only good song period."
2,hopin' 4 better,"this cd is way to repetitive, and even though tairrie is screamin' her eyes out over heavy guitars, its just missing a whole lot of something...her screaming sounds way to forced, so that kinda ruins the experiencethe first 2 albums are WAY betterbest song: STINKFACE (very fast {ok} song)worst song: WEIGHTLESS (o god!, its horrible)if you want to check out my ruin, i suggest speak & destroy, then, a prayer under pressure of violent anguish...this cd isnt TOTALLY worth itAND if you want another crappy cd by tairrie b., be sure to check out 'the power of a woman' by tairrie b....you'll be sure to be dissapointed!!!!...yay!{if my ruin keeps releasing stuff like horror of beauty, then im sure theyll lose a bit 'o popularity with their fans, -thats how bad/good it is-}"
4,"Better then the last, but not great","Well comparing this album to the last (which I thought was a disapointment), H.O.B. is better musically and Tairrie's voice sounds right on cue. But it lacks that special something that makes an album great, in my opinion. I still love My Ruin and the album is still worth buying, but don't expect to be blown away."
1,Bad seller- do not use!,"I ordered this and received an e-mail the next day stating that it had been shipped. 10 days later, I got an e-mail from the seller stating that they did not have any more of this product left and that it had never been shipped. Considering that this was medicine for my sick fish, that was 10 days that were wasted, where I could have been treating my fish. The seller lied by stating the product had been shipped when, in fact, they didn't have any of the product at all.I would NOT recommend this seller to anyone."
2,Foul odor,"For a $18 surge protector, I would expect this unit to have quality construction. As soon as I opened the package, my whole house reeked of a terrible cheap plastic smell. I have to believe this is bad for your health. The smell is akin to the cheap Spectre TVs Costco used to sell. Functionally it seems to be ok, but if you are sensitive to smells I would not recommend this product."
4,Very Useful,"We purchased this because my apartment building is old and doesn't have an up-to-date electrical system; it's easily overloaded and I'm constantly replacing fuses. This product does exactly what it says it does; ships quickly; is of good quality, and overall suited my needs."
5,Good product,"I bought this product for our entertainment system setup, and it works great. We have the 50"" tv, satellite receiver, surround system, and other miscellaneous little things plugged up to it, and it's been working great so far."
4,I'd Like One Fireman To Go Please!,"A very good movie depicting the personal lives of those involved as well as the problems at hand. The firemen were believable in their parts on and off the job. I enjoyed this movie, was involved with the characters and wanted to know what happened to the seemingly doomed marriage of Fireman Merritt (Ben Murphy) and his alcoholic wife. Is there one out there just like him?"
4,Interesting Experimental Fiction,"These two novels (the author's third and fourth, respectively) make for a pretty good introduction to the strange world of Alain Robbe-Grillet. I tend to think of his books as post-modern detective stories, in which the mystery to be solved is nothing less than existence itself; that the reader often finds himself in the dark is very much to the point. They should be interesting to anyone looking for an off-the-beaten-path read.""Jealousy"" (the better of the two) deals with a love triangle in a remote African plantation... which may or may not be all in the narrator's mind. It's creepy and enigmatic. ""In the Labyrinth"" is a vaguely Kafkaesque tale about a soldier attempting to deliver a mysterious package in a vast, unnamed city. Admittedly, Robbe-Grillet is not the most approachable of authors, but these densely composed novels amply pay off the attention required to read them."
2,Translated from French without flair.,"Read this for a book club. Very hard to get into due to Robbe-Grillet's use of decriptive images of people, objects, and nature in the novel several times over and over. This may be his way of presenting the characters, and situations to give you an image of what was happening in the novel, but you had to shift through all the descriptive writing without the use of adjectives to understand what he was trying to convey. I pushed myself to read this book hoping it would get better and I would be able to get something out of it. The best thing was just getting out of this book."
2,poor printing quality,I get books partly for their physical feel so that is why the printing quality matters to me. This book has standard average design cover. The inside looks like a bad xerox copy that looks like a make-to-order book. I had ordered another edition of the identical book hoping to regain the lost quality in this edition. I do admit that I had not read the book so my comment should not have any bearing on its content.
2,Virtually useless. Horrible index and full of errors.,"While I agree with some of the other reviews here relative to some fairly good examples, the book, taken in its entirety, is garbage. I'm really very sorry, but that's being kind. There are several nasty errors regarding the operation of the Class Wizard, and the index is simply a text table with page numbers. You simply cannot find anything using the index. I've resorted to Post-it notes. The Cover says the book is ""continuously updated"" on a web site. That's simply not true. I've sent in errors to the authors that after a year haven't been posted on this web site. Please, if you want a decent book on MFC, use ""Inside Visual C++"" by Kruglinski, or ""Programming Windows 95 with MFC"" by Prosise. Don't waste your money on this thing."
3,Half of the book has been updated on the web.,"This book is good and bad. Good in the fact the the reading is good and it the book goes over each line of code for you. I would have given it 5 starts but the book says that it's updated on the web. If you go there, over half the book is updated, because the code doens't work with the newest VC++. Who wants to print out all those pages or read then on you screen. They need to get a new up to date book with all the updates."
3,This book forget Win95 isn't Win NT,"Chapter about edit text forget to say that EM_SETHANDLE (and EM_GETHANDLE) is not implemented under Win95 so example code crashes without apparently motivation. Chapter about owner-draw control is very good, a (very) short but good description about BitBlt with user raster operations."
3,Complements Brain Gym - simple exercises for whole brain learning!,"This book is originally designed for adolescents & young adults with language disabilities.I bought this book because I was attracted by the subtitle: Calisthenics for the Brain. I found out later that they can, in some way, complement as well as supplement my Brain Gym books written by Paul Dennison.As a professional & success coach, I have found that some of the warm-up exercises very enjoyable & useful in the classroom, both for kids, teens & adults.My only adverse comment about this book is that many of the exercise stuff introduced are quite sketchy & needed to be explained explicitly."
4,Amazon recommendation,"Amazon recommended this novel along with many others. So far, I am very pleased with most of the novels they suggested. I wlll continue to read more of their suggestions."
3,"Great start, poor finish.","The Hammer and the Cross started a potentially excellent series; the premise, the rediscovery of lost technology, together with the inclusive approach to religion, offered a more than competent and generally exciting author vast scope to demonstrate his powers. Having made the first book so intriguing that I could hardly wait for the second, I was delighted with ""One king's way"" - not only were the situations in the first volume moved towards a resolution {albeit by largely dropping the female interest in tH&C}, but fascinating new creatures were introduced. The third volume seemed to drop most of the original themes to concentrate on one, which proved least interesting. There was a conclusion to the story, but it seemed to me, at least, that the author had lost interest and commitment to the project. After an enthralling beginning and a strong middle movement, the orchestra went home."
2,a big let down,"after reading the 1st 2 books of the trilogy I was expecting a story of similiar caliber. While the book was interesting it was not on the same level as the 1st 2 books in the trilogy. The main players acted all out of charecter compared to the previous 2 books. The last 1/3 of of the book seem to be rushed & slapped together; the final battle was dissappointing to say the least. If you're a big fan of the triology, get the book to complete the loop; otherwise don't bother."
4,"Gritty, interesting (alt) history stories","I read these books a few years back at the same time as my brother in-law. We were both impressed by the depth, (alt)history, and interest in the stories. Not as thick as a George R.R. Martin's books, but a similar grittiness. (The first book features the removal of limbs by sword and preserving of life by searing the limbs with fire to cauterize the wounds. eeyoo!)The stories are really well crafted and takes the reader from the North Sea to the Medeterainian and throughout the land masses in between. The character develpoment kept me reading the entire series end to end despite my semi-revulsion at the gore.As a fan of Orson Scott Card, Issac Asimov, Terry Goodkind, C.J. Cherryh, Mercedes Lackey, Neal Stephanson and Carl Sagan, I can say I liked this book and its predecessors enough to read them all."
3,Not quite what I expected,"This was a bit of a disappointing finale to an otherwise excellent trilogy. The previous book (""One King's Way"") and part of this one build towards a climactic battle between Shef's kingdom and the new Holy Roman Empire, but fizzles out towards the end. Harrison's theories on holy relics of the Christian faith is somewhat interesting, but he apparently has some misgivings about Christianity and lets it show through in the story. The ending was a definate disappointment, and I almost get the feeling that Harrison simply got tired of the storyline and just wanted it to end (something which I felt in his last Stainless Steel Rat novel, as well). Overall, I truly loved the trilogy, but this last ""chapter"" of the story is by far the weakest link."
2,Blows it in the end.,"Eh, I suffered through this book, but didn't enjoy it very much at all. It veers into Holy Blood Holy Grail speculating, and wraps up with some sort of bizarre thing where our favorite super-techno Viking becomes a cut-rate Christ figure, or something.I just sort of shrugged at the sainlty Vikings who followed The Way for two books, but this time it got really screedy-anyone who thought these books were just an exploration of alternate history instead of Harrison's Great Statement should be quite disabused by this novel."
5,Great Book!,This book will tell you the real story! If you want to get a picture of the rebbe's early years this book is a must!
2,"tight fit, bad fit","Although this claims to be from ""precision design"", the thread on the hood does not fit the thread on the lense well, and you need to twist it really hard to mount either forward or backward. It takes so much force that makes me worry that I'm gonna one day destroy my lense. On the other hand, I've never tried the original Canon hood coz it's twice as expensive. So anyone can give me some feed back on how the Canon hood fits would be appreciated."
4,Cheap but does the job,"This hood is inexpensive, and it has an inexpensive feel. The alignment marks do not match on my Canon 18-135 EF-S IS lens unless you want the words ""Design for Canon EW-73B"" to be on the underside of the lens when locked in place. The hood does not intrude into the picture no matter what the zoom level (at least with this lens). The plastic feels exactly the same stiffness as the Tamron-name hood on my Tamron zoom. The plastic's finish is matte, and is less reflective than my other hoods. For the money, it's quite a decent product."
3,its okay......,"It was great at first, however it doesn't lock properly on my lens, so the slightest twist can make the hood fall right off. Can't complain for the price though."
4,Works out good,"Sometimes it's a little hard to get it to lock when facing the other way for storage, but otherwise it works out fine. The locking could be better."
3,generally ok,"the hood is passable. does not fit as good as a real Canon part. but at a fraction of the price, it's worth it"
5,"Yes,I found this book great",I do not know of any other book out there on the subject of World War Two JapaneseProficiency Badges.I found the book of great interest and a help in identifying medals and badges
2,Needs an originality transplant,"This movie was just a remake of BarberShop minus the spouse. I could go into details but all you have to do is watch Barbershop and you see the same movie. The discussions about social issues, relationship problems, little business versus the corporate giant, even the dance scene. It's all there. I love the actors - especially Monica Calhoun - but this is simply a rehash of a movie from years ago. I honestly expected better from Vivica Fox. Not in terms of acting, but in terms of a movie to be in."
2,Good movie,"Good movie, inspiring message...sad to say it has that ""flaming"" character that is always thrown into every barber shop/beauty shop/urban black movie. If you're going to portray people nd their lifestyles at least give them dignity. That was my only complaint. I liked it though and its worth buying cheap."
1,I can't even say covert agenda- too poorly written,This film watches as though the writers got together one day and numerically listed all the stereotypes we've ever heard about black communities and then gave each one a five-minute format. Everyone of these characters needs Jesus. Hater Movie!!
4,"A little, ghetto gem...","The cast of characters in this indie, ghetto, wannabe Barbershop/Beauty Shop is ridiculous and I love it. I think it's actually ten times better than Beauty Shop. No offense Q.L."
3,Just okay,"This was okay. I wouldn't say run out and go get the movie, but I will say it was watchable."
4,Great afternnon/evening entertainment,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Lots of laughter. Although some parts were just unbelievable it is a lot funnier than some other ""hair salon"" movies."
4,Barbaric Blackened Death Metal From Florida,"Diabolic has been around for a while spreading their message of brutal blackened death metal to the underground scene. If you like this style of music at all I recommend you get this, because it is the blueprint for the style. Nothing new to find here but they do what they do very well. If you like Diabolic I recommend you also listen to Unholy Ghost, they have old members of Diabolic and they are practically the same band. The vocals are brutal, the lyrics satanic and anti christian, and the music is old school. Elitist metalheads will find plenty to love here."
5,Yes...a great discovery,"I came across Kiki a few months back whilst looking for a version of Low Spark... I was lucky enough to stumble onto her fantastic voice. So much better than a good Ricki Lee Jones....better than Norah Jones too for that matter. Her talents are a gift not only to her but to all fortunate to hear her. Wish she would tour more out here in New England. Lastly, as good as she is her band is very talented and her back up singer(s) makes the album all the more better. Her producer does a very nice job too. Overall...believe me, you can't go wrong with her. Re albums: I have Kiki and I have Love Loud. More to be purchased soon. Enjoy...and let others know. We'll see her on the Grammys soon...or there's no justice."
5,Great Book for Newbie RVers!,I read this book quite some time ago when my husband and I set off fulltiming in 2005 at the age of 25. It was a great help and we enjoyed reading it:-)
2,Perky? But who needs perky?,"A ""perky"" book, the media reviewer calls this effort at providing much-needed information for beginning RVers. Frothy might be more like it. And, at least in areas I have experience in, containing misinformation that makes it appear the authors spent more time on being cute than they did on research.There are a lot of GOOD books out there on RVing details that can help a beginner. This isn't one of them."
3,"A very good book, as far as it goes ...","... my only complaint is that it doesn't go anywhere NEAR far enough. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found lots of good advice, but too many topics are given cursory treatment. It is a long way short of ""Everything You Need to Know About Choosing, Using, and Enjoying Your Rv."" Perhaps if it was about twice as long, it might start to live up to its title."
3,Rv Bible,Nice basic story but not very helpful. Just bought a RV and was looking for more generalized info. Will look for other guides
2,Title should be THE RV GUIDE FOR IDIOTS,This book contained only the most elemental information that anyone who can buy an RV already knows. Don't waste your money on this book.
3,"Good Intro for ""never-ever"" RVer . . . but dated material","I found this book to be a good reference for the neophyte RVer (like me) who's exploring the idea of a RV lifestyle for retirement. The book was informative on a basic level about many RV topics and outlined several issues to consider before selecting a particular type/class of RV best suited for the full-time or occasional RVer. However, I found many areas in the book to be somewhat comical when referencing dated material to make a point. It would be great if the authors updated and printed a new edition with more emphasis of the latest technology currently available to the RV community."
3,"Good, but definitely NOT ""the RVer's Bible""","I found this book to be okay, but it lacked many things, especially organization of important information into charts/tables etc. and more details on different makes/models with ratings.Well, I doubt I would recommend the book to a novice.Barely 3 stars, but certainly better than just 2 stars. When title proclaims its a ""Bible"" for a subject, you set expectations, and they are not met in this book. REWRITE THE BOOK!"
1,"many words, little substance","I was disappointed with this book. As a novice RVer I was looking for a more complete guide to RVing. The prose was too ""cutesy"" and I think many serious readers would be insulted by the tone of the book.If you are looking for a guide to help you get started, one that explains systems, trailering, the variety of RVs available in an intelligent way, this is not it! A far better (and less expensive) book is the Moellers' RVing Basics."
2,"An okay intro - not a lot of ""meat""","Generally okay for a newbie like me, but I was hoping for more.I found the writing style a bit annoying...seemed to say the same things over and over, with lots of ""noise"" words and little substance. Almost like they had contracted to write a 20,000 word book - but when they were done, there were only 12,000 so they went back and added some ""fluff""."
1,As a newbe i had hoped to learn something,I knew nothing about RVing when I bought this book.It is page after page of opinion.After reading it I am both ignorant and confused.All the technologh is either confusing or obsolete
2,"Great in it's day, but hopelessly dated","Well written, good topics, nice pix, but hopelessy dated. Was written in 1996-7 and so much has changed since then makes this one of the last books to buy if at all."
2,Really lean,Not that much info in this book. It was written before the widespread use of the Internet and now with sites like rv.net you can get much more information surfing the net for a couple of hours.
2,check the advice,"This book suggests using Grizzly bear mace for self protection rather than firearms, but mentions nothing that Canada considers this a weapon just like firearms, and it is contraband. I was thrown out of Canada, because the owner of the car forgot that there was some in her car. They said we would have to apply to the Canadian Embassy to ever visit again! Otherweise it looks like great advice.Also they did not mention in their free camping section that [retail store]'s corporate policy is to allow RVers to park overnightfor free. Some individual W-M's don't, so check with the Manager before you do so(Preferably with purchases in hand."
3,Get this book BEFORE you shop for a used RV.,"We should have bought this book BEFORE we started shopping for a used motorhome. Lots of good info on how to shop, questions to ask, what to look for, etc. It did not, however, give us enough of what we were looking for in terms of how to use our new (to us) motor home. Since it was published in 1997, more current information is needed."
4,RVers Bible,The RVers Bible.Is full of info that the begining rver to the pro can use.there is info that every reader can use.
4,Looking for a new ab video?,"If you are looking to work those abs in the least time possible, then this video is for you. In less than 10 minutes a day you can get a complete ab workout -- upper, lower, as well as obliques. The video is made from spliced portions of other Firm workouts so you get 5 different instructors, just like in the original ""5 Day Abs"". Although this video seems a bit easier than the original, it still provides a tough ab workout and a nice change of pace. There is not much instruction during each segment on proper form so beginners may want to watch the segment first before they try some of the moves. If you can only get 1 ab video, I would buy the original ""5 Day Abs"" first, but this would be a good addition to your video library if you need a little something different to stay motivated."
5,All time favorite since I was 12 years old,"This is a great ab video, lots of different exercises to hit all the major and minor areas. The music is fun and keeps you interested in the workout. I general do the entire video opposed to separating the sessions for each day. I wish they would come out with this tape as a DVD version though."
5,Great buy!,This video is a bit outdated but is still the best abdominal exercise video I have ever found. It gets the job done in around 5 minutes and you deffinately feel the burn!
5,This book is a must have,"I would recommend this book to any parent having trouble with their teenager or even preteen. I had bought a couple of other books that were recommended by my son's couselor, but I saw this one and it is by far the best book out there."
5,A great Buy!,A must buy for beneficial strategic parenting info! Good information to help recognize various behavioral patterns.
2,If you would like to drive youself absolutely nuts..........,"I was having great diffuculty with my teenage daughter and bought this on DR. Lauras recommendation. Although I read this book and tried the ""I can control my kids with contracts"" approach...it will not work w/ a hell bent teen. Scots approach seemed to have escalated my teens bad behavior. You may have to be separated from your teen, boarding school seems to be working just fine for us, plus counseling, an openess to changing your heart and A LOT of reading. If you have a real problem child....dont waste you money on this book.I would like to recommend a much better approach, a book by 2 doctors (with 5 kids of their own)which makes much more sense...""How to deal with your acting up teenager"" by Robert and Jean Bayard (P.H.D's)."
4,Purchased as a resource for clients,Nicely structured and very reader-friendly. I purchased this as a resource for the parents of my clients and I find that it is very well suited for this purpose.
4,Book Review,"After reading several different books on dealing with a difficult child, this one really hit home. Although some of the ideas seemed extreme, we found this book coupled with others we have read was beneficial. This book was right on about my son."
4,Very helpful book,It helped my wife and I with our daughter. She was headed down a bad road and this book helped us to get her on the right path.
3,Out of Control Teen - Delinquency and Juvenile Control,"You may also want to check out ""Delinquency and Juvenile Control"".My husband & I took our son to the school pyschologist. I noticed a book on his desk ""Delinquency and Juvenile control"". Most of what he told us I found in my own copy of the book - there are a few copies left at www.amazonsells.tk/juvenile. We used it as our playbook now he's a complete person. It's been a 1yr now since his last out burst."
4,"So many options, good information.",Every child and every parent requires a unique set of controls and techniques. This book provides many options and ideas for dealing with a very difficult situation. Keep exploring as many options as possible http://bit.ly/6Jt8zT
2,Not very realistic,"We would have a problem applying some of the heavy techniques in this book for our moderately out-of-control kids. I think this is a good book for those with seriously out of control teenagers. However for both the serious and less serious cases, some of the recommendations in the book are just too unrealistic, and a little repetitive."
5,On the money,"Your teen is living in a storm of hormones and temptations. You have to be the rock in the storm. I have read all the popular books on problem teens and this one is the best by far. His advice on how to handle the seven aces is practical and works! It was my favorite part as previously I had no idea what to do.I did not do the contract. I made a list of rules and consequences if the rules were broken. Re other reviews, I don't think there is anything Gestapo-like about laying down some rules. You aren't going to live in harmony with anyone who thinks that friendships and immediate gratification are more important than family and school.My advice is, take the bull by the horns and buy this book."
5,Best Book On This Topic,"I have used this book and Dr. Sells suggestions with parents for five years. This book explains how problems develop with teens, practical suggestions on how to stop the problems and the book also covers the topic on how to heal and improve the relationships between parents and teens that are out of control. Parents: It is best to read the entire book before you start enforcing contracts with the teens."
2,Parents Beware,"Perhaps this book should have been titled, ""Parenting your extremely disrespectful teen"".I read the first couple of chapters of this book with some hope that the author understood the deep frustration that parents of a wild teen are going through. While I still feel that to be true, the author continually addresses such ""out of control"" behaviors as ""swearing"" and ""refusing to clean his room"". If only those were the problems we were facing in our home!I searched the book for the two primary problems which we are facing, which are lying and promiscuity. Sadly, the author does not address these two subjects in any detail. In short, he gives no strategies whatsoever to deal with those problems. If your teen is TRULY out of control, you may want to get this book from the library first and see if the issues you are facing are addressed before spending any money."
5,At last I found help that works!!!,"I highly recommend this book. I have recommended it to several people and it has worked for them as well. I am using the techniques in the book, and to my amazement, they are working! I have read several other books and they tell you what to do, but don't tell you what to do if their idea doesn't work - this book has back up plans for everything. I found this book to be the best help we have found. If you follow the program, it will work. I was skeptical but they made a believer out of me."
5,best book on the subject,I am a family therapist in Georgia. I give this book out to every family that comes into my office. This isn't about blaming parents. These are real tools parents can really use. I am also a parent of two teens. These tools have worked for me.
5,This is the Fan Book You Have Been Waiting To Read,This book is filled with interesting information about Clay Aiken packed into 160 pages of fun reading. In addition there is a 16 page color insert with page after page of wonderful photographs of Clay. The book is a real fan book that will not disappoint anyone who wants everything about Clay in one book. I'll bet that even the most devoted Clay fan will learn new things about Clay.
5,Clay AIken: From Second Place To The top Of The Charts,"I could not put this book down. I watched Clay Aiken Go from a geeky looking kid sanding in front of Simon Cowell telling him that he felt he could have at least made it into the final 10, I have been a great fan of his since that day. It was interesting to read about him and find out what makes him tick. He is an interesting young man and I think everyone aught to read this very interesting book."
1,This book was not authorized by Clay Aiken,"This book was not authorized by Clay Aiken, and I know this for a FACT!! She has taken what others have said, and combined this information. We do NOT know what is true if a book is NOT AUTHORIZED, and therefore, should not be purchased!! Kathleen Tracy is trying to capitolize on Clay's name for her own monetary benefit. If she was truly a fan, she would not have done this!! She never interviewed Clay or his mother. I do hope you will post this. If people REALLY want to read about Clay, they need to read ""Learning to Sing, and Hearing The Music."" THIS IS AN AUTHORIZED BOOK..."
2,Not everything it is advertised to be.,"Purchased this a while back for monitoring the kids play room. Anyone with kids knows that at times the parent needs to make a judgement call when one comes out crying. Or even both. :) This eliminated much of the guesswork. While it did serve it's purpose, the image quality is marginal at best. It claims a 460 line resolution, to be honest I have had cameras long ago priced less that offered better color and resolution. Closer to 320 would be more like it. I have since upgraded this camera to a 520 Sony sensor camera offering far better low light ability.I purchased this camera for about 5 times less than what they are asking now and though I would not mind paying what I originally had paid, no way is it worth the $150+ price as of this review when so many superior options are available in a dome camera for less then half that."
4,Coveralls with zipper front,My husband and I bought these for bee-keeping suits. We were satisfied with our purchase and would buy these again.
4,Wood Grain Contact Paper,"I needed to contact the company to ask some questions about the product. The people were very friendly and helpful. The product was shipped and delivered quickly. I was very pleased the Wood Grain Contact paper looked exactly as I expected. The paper didn't adhear to the surface I was using as well as I had hoped, but that could be partly due to the cold weather conditions I was working in. I would definitely purchase this or similar products from this company again."
2,couldn't be less tacky,"I ordered 2 units of this product. Both came with the same packaging, product ID, and UPC. However the color was a shade off, and the wood grain pattern did not match at all. Also, the next day observation was that one stuck to my (clean cabinets) just fine, while the other peeled up in the corners and around the edges. The tacky adhesive was inconsistant from roll to roll. It ended up making my cabinets look trashy.Vendor did make the products arrive quickly and the package was well protected."
1,Stuff does not stick!,"Bought the stuff intending to cover a corner and line some drawers but it is TERRIBLE.Looks good, sticks about as good as a yellow Post-it!! Seriously does not stay down curls up terrible stuff.....not worth it......."
4,Enough to cover the world.,"Damaged some cheap furniture during a move. Found this product to cover it up. a little darker than anticipated, but not un-workable. The roll they send you could cover the entire furniture needs of a small house!"
2,Didn't really care for the product,"Color didn't real match what I needed. Looked lighter on-line, and it does not stick very well. I basically wasted the price of the product."
3,color,it was not as dark as it looks in the picture but other than that it is fine I would have liked it a little darker
2,Wrong Color,"I purchased this item because I needed to cover the toe kick portion of our kitchen cabinets. The shade of the ""ultra honey oak"" in the ad was exactly what I was looking for. When the item arrived at my house I was dismayed to discover the color was more much more brown than the golden tone I thought I was buying."
2,Underwhelmed,"Online, the product looks awesome! The reality was underwhelming. The snowman packaging was cute, but the items within were not at all attractive. I was so disappointed that I removed the contents and replaced with my own. Very disappointing."
2,Don't waste your money ...,This was very disappointing. Much smaller and less appealing than the photograph and description. The cookies weren't even edible.
4,Christmas gift,The tower was what I wanted for family gifts. Didn't get to view the contents but I am sure they were OK
4,Great Adventure!,This is a great adventure. I can't wait to run the next one in the series. My gaming group loved it!!This module was better than most of the others in the D20 market. I really liked the elves and dwarves being given unique racial identities rather than just being called elves and dwarves.
4,"Good product, fair price","Purchased a pair, shipping costs were reduced by the seller without my asking. Units arrived very well packed and within 3 business days via standard shipping. The drawers are well made and simple to install under mount or side mounted. The extension slides are smooth and handle the limited amount of weight with a nice dampened action. The local chain office supply store has a comparable unit for 79.95 USD each. I had a pair of these delivered to my home for a total 61.10 USD."
2,Cheap & wrong size,Wish I had spent a little more and got a batter product. Don't waste your money and spend a little more on a better drawer.
5,Excellent,"Most amazing product ever seen. Took 5 min to install with drill machine.you dont need anything other than your 2 hands and drill machine to set this up.durable, clean, looks very professional and good.I would consider buying it again and again if needed for other offices."
4,SHINE,"This is an absolute awesome peice of music! Ed Roland is a genius! I am a newly devoted COLLECTIVE SOUL fan and have been collecting all of their albums since the release of BLENDER. Although, it is a little pricey for an import... all together 4 STARS for Collective Soul and the very talented ED ROLAND!!"
5,The best so far,"This book is my apsolute FAV. I love it.If you've read the first two books you know that Adriane and Stormbringer are really close and you know that Storm thinks she's the last mistwolf. Key word: thinks. Well, Storm isn't the last of her kind. A pack of Mistwolves drop in for a visit at Ravenswood. Then they leave taking Storm with them. Adriane has to talk to her one last time. So she gets Kara to get the Dragonflies to open the portal. Instead of just talking to Storm she gets pulled into Aldenmor! Where she meets Zach a boy who never saw another human and his griffin. Zach has some secrets that just might mean saving Storm. She also meets the sorceress, sees Fairy Glen and the fairymentals who suceed in confussing her even more. and Meets a Dragon! But will that be enough to save Stormbringer?"
5,Excellent book! Beatufully written!,This Was A Great Book! Adriane is my favorite character. I even wrote a sequel to it called: Avalon : Web Of Magic: Destiny To Aldenmor.
5,Better Than Expected,"I stole this book from my sister because I had nothing better to read, not expecting much I plunged into it. Little did I know what a great book it would turn out to be, luckily my sister owns the rest of the books so I can read the other ones. I normally read adult books but I would recommend this book to anyone who likes magick!"
5,awesome for all ages,"This book is prehaps my favorite out of all of the books. Adriane is willful and strong. When she is pulled into Aldenmore, even if she feels like she can't go on, she keeps her head high and moves forward. The mistwolves are a major part of the entire series and in this book, they are shown in a new light, slightly harsh and sometimes cruel, but always for the safety and wellfare of the pack. I would recomend this book to anyone who is willing to sit down and read a fantasy story about loyalty, friendship and the never ending bond that is love."
5,"Mages,Monsters and More","The book Cry of the Wolf was an awesome book. It has dragons, wolves and griffins, some of my favorite mythical creatures. My favorite character is Adriane. Adriane is about 14; she has two friends' that are total opposites. My favorite part is when she battles the manticore.Cry of the Wolf is about a girl named Adriane who lets her bonded animal Stormbringer (bonded animal is an animal that balances their magic) go into the magical world Aldenmore with wolves. Adriane gets worried and goes after her. While she looks for her she makes friends with a boy named Zach and gets a dragon for a bonded animal.The dark sorceress captures her. While she's in the dungeon she finds another mistwolf. With the help of the other animals in the dungeon she gets out. When she gets out she has to battle the manticore . After that Stormbringer comes back with the rest of the pack. So Adriane finds her bonded animal and goes back to earth."
5,I'm hooked!,"This was a very good book. I really felt Adriane's pain when Storm left. Adriane's parents moved to who-knows-where and left Adriane alone with her strange grandmother. Adriane feels unwanted. The only person who really understands her is Stormbringer. They both feel the same pain. When Storm finds out that there are more like him, he is tempted to run with the pack of mistwolves. He does, and Adriane is left all alone. Adriane can't go on without Storm and trys to contact him. But something happens, and Adriane is pushed through a portal, into the Shadowlands. There, Adriane is attacked and a strange boy rescues her. She finds out his secrets. They are really surprising. Adriane meets the fairimentals and recieves an important message. All in all, a great book for anyone who loves to read."
4,Boothe is mistaken,"The previous reviewer (Boothe) is greatly mistaken about the purpose and quality of this book. Although i do not own this edition, previous editions have always been excellent. Apparently he did not realize that the National Electrical Safety Code is specifically written for utility workers, lineman, substation maintenance and construction, power generation etc. The National Electrical Code is the designated code for non-utility wiring. To rate this publication poorly because HE mistook its purpose is grossly unfair to the many talented authors of this handbook."
4,WYSIWYG,"Great handbook. Some of the more commonly used sections have more details, some things less commonly referenced have little to no details. The negative reviewer obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. This book covers exactly what it's supposed to. I wouldn't want a person who doesn't even know the difference between NESC and NEC to do ANY kind of electrical work. The only thing to really note is that the book is seriously small. The pictures make it appear to be a full sized text book but it's really about half size. That's not a big deal but I just was a little surprised when I got it. Like the other review said though, this is not a substitute for the IEEE NESC book, but appears to provide a good overview of what are probably the more commonly referenced rules."
1,I would have liked to review this product,I would have liked to review this product but I never received it and never received a response from the seller. I attempted to purchase the book from one of the other seller that appeared on the Amazon site. I think twice now when I try to by from someone other than Amazon.
5,great album,"I heard about Funky in a collection of songs called ""Gotta Have Musica Cristiana"", and loved the song Mi Maestro so much I bought Funky's CD Especie en Peligro. I love it. Almost every song is catchy, different from the others. Spanish is not my first language but I enjoy it thoroughly."
2,The Most Boring Journey,"If you like adventure games that 1) have unchallenging puzzles 2) are long on dialog but short on gameplay 3) are sappy and silly, this is the game for you.I couldn't wait to zip through this dull chore, having been forced to endure endless chatter from birds, priests and aliens. And I mean ENDLESS. If I wanted an adventure game to be the pc equivalent of a book-on-tape, this is what I would buy."
1,No Journey,Will only half way install. 2 nd copy received as a gift and still does not play.load or anything. Save yourself the frustration and take a pass
5,The Longest Journey,"If you are bored with first person shooters, complex strategy games, rpgs that take a life time to finish, then this game could be for you. Share a fantastic adventure between Arcadia and Stark with art student April Ryan. Along the journey you will meet the most interesting creatures, characters, and villains as you find the fancinating truth behind April's true origin.Lay out of the game is okay, only 2 dimensional scenes however, graphics are quite good. Voice overs and background sound and music are very good as they enrich your game play experience. Game play and Movements are just point and click - pretty much like the old sierra games (Kings Quest and Quest for Glory). Overall, if you love adventure fantasy games you will love this."
4,A lovely adventure,"If endless running, shooting, battling, running, shooting, battling is not your thing, then I highly recommend you take this journey with April Ryan. Great scenery, not so very complicated puzzles and a nice ending make for lovely adventure."
4,"Wonderful game, although it leaves you hanging","I can not begin to describe how wonderful this game is. I spent hours delving into the character of April Ryan, not to mention captivated by the mystery of Stark & Arcadia. This is a game filled with breathtaking scenery and heartbraking moments.Their is an enormous of dialogue, but it serves to tell you the story of the two worlds, and enhances the game play if you can sit through it all.The only thing that keeps me from giving it four stars however is the frustration I was left with at the end. After hours upon hours of game play the writers left you with so many unaswered questions. A sequel to fill in these details and hopefully the rest of April and Crow's adventures (which are hinted at later on) will definately boost this game up to 4.5 stars! (the excessive explicit language and extensive dialogue will unfortunately keep it at 4.5).(There is a lot of adult language in this game, thus I do not recommend it for children, or for younger teens)."
5,The Best Journey,"the longest journey is a great game. it has everything in it: it's funny, intriguing, sad and scary. the plot develops smoothly, and sometimes you feel you watch a movie rather than play a game. the graphics are top-notch, although an improvement in the characters would not do any harm, and the SFX and music are second to none. the actors role their characters very well. the longest journey is one of those special games that truly take you into the atmosphere. you can play it 5 hours and feel that only 5 minutes passed. it's quite easy to solve, you only have to think logically in some places rather than do the obvious. the only thing that disappointed me was the ending; you can't tell what happens to almost nobody. i'm waiting impatiently for the sequel, and so should you. i would give it a 6 star rating, only the problem is there is only 5. go get it!"
5,Visually Amazing,"If anyone is debating whether to get this game or not, just go get it! It's amazing! April Ryan, the main character, talks like a normal person and acts just like an 18 year old should.One of my favourite parts of this game is April's diary, after something interesting happens, you can read what April's thought were, and some are very hilarious!The only beef I have with this game is the amount of reading. I'm not against reading, but in some parts of the game, you sit and read, with no choice to leave the computer or you'll miss something, for 10-15 minutes or more at a time.Other than this, a total A+! I wish there were more games like it!"
3,Awesome Graphics,"The storyline and graphics for this game are outstanding. Unfortunately, great games are not built entirely around just graphics and storyline. I found the game fun and entertaining but could only give it 3 stars due to the difficulty and lack of logic needed to solve some of the puzzles. The game seems to move a bit too slow and the characters tend to be very long-winded. Sometimes it can take up to 15 minutes just to listen to one monologue. Very fun at first but tedious after a while. Trying too hard to make a novel out of a game"
4,Very good!,"This was a very good. The second best adventure game Ive ever played. Its good, but not as good as the Gabriel Knight series. The Knight games have a more intelligent story, with real mysteries, real places, many real people and many real historical facts. You solve the mysteries in a more realistic way. The fantasy and sci-fi setting in The Longest Journey isnt that compelling. But the graphics and athmosphere is wonderful, and it has a fun and good written story. Great places, nice characters, good dialogue(alot of dialogue) and much offensive language. I loved that, made it so much real. If the future of the world lies in your hands, who wouldnt swear? To summon up; The game lacks the plot and mystery of the Gabriel Knight games, but what makes it enjoyable is the nice graphics, great puzzles and a good detailed written story, in a sci-fi setting. Buy it!"
4,Very Fun and Very Entertaining,I vary much enjoyed this game. I loved the characters. I didn't want to journey to end. I found it very fun and would recommend it to anyone. I wish they had produced a sequel.
2,Yawnnnnnnnnnn,"I LOVE adventure games. Got hooked on the genre with MYST. I can only be proud that I bought this one as a used game thru Amazon. Trust me, the puzzles are simple-minded and there is way too much dialog. The plusses are that the game is very stable and does not crash. The plot line is interesting. I did use hints a few times at the end because I just wanted to finish and find out how it came out. I took about two weeks to play the game in and amongst working virtual office and waiting for phone calls at home. But I didn't EVER feel the need to get back to it to find out what happened next.Am going to try Syberia next and hope for the best."
3,A Story-Only Game,"We found the story of The Longest Journey to be engrossing, but thought the game play was lacking. There are almost no puzzles of the sort found in Myst. Advancing in the game consists of talking to everyone and determining which inventory item will work in the situation. It took quite us quite a while to finish only because the speeches take such a long time. The background graphics are excellent, though the rendering of some of the characters is poor (e.g. some have no fingers, just mitts). The language in the game is needlessly very blue. We had to ban our children from the room while playing."
5,"I love you, April.","I lack a social life. I'm just thankfull that April's always there to take me on an adventure when I'm bored. April's my dream date: smart, artistic, funny, and rather attractive...and what's a more romantic date than one that involves saving the world together? Kidding aside, this game seriously rejuvinates the adventure game genre. I dread the day I finish this adventure because its so engrossing I just don't want it to go away. Pick up a copy and enjoy!"
2,The Looooongest Journey,"I just wanted the talking to end. The dialogue is inane and endless and you have to talk to everyone and hear absolutely everything they have to say to progress in the game. I personally didn't like any of the characters and found April, the main character, particularly annoying and perhaps one of the most bland and corny characters ever created. The puzzles were mostly simple and action nonexistent, so all in all, bored as hell. The only plus would be graphically speaking. The worlds are rendered beautifully, but you have to go back and forth through them so much, even that wears on you."
3,"Fun, but very very disappointing","I'm probably one of the few people in the world who actually plays games like this for the STORY. The game itself was great. Very well put together, decent interface once I got used to it, challenging but not TOO hard. Good graphics, good character interactions, etc. However, the plot of the story had huge holes in it (what about..???) and the ending was so much like, 'oops, we ran out of money, better just end it now' that I was disgusted. Might be setting us up for a sequel, but it was just so anti-climactic and disappointing that I wouldn't even buy a sequel."
3,The Longest Talk-fest,"Yes, this is a beautifully rendered game. It is, at the very least, a milestone in the genre, if not a major step forward. But my gosh, how much talking can a person take? The dialog seemed endless in some parts. I did not object to the profanity of Flipper and Zack--at least it made the dialog interesting, which is not a word I would use to describe a lot of it.The puzzles, on which the flow of the game depends, range from easy to what-the-heck-were-they-thinking?! But in 13 chapters of play (12 chapters really, one chapter is all, what else--talk) a game is bound to run the gamet.You definitely get your money's worth in playtime, and the visuals and the music are wonderful. Now if we could just get some of those characters to shut up..."
3,"Flawed, but buy it anyway.","I had problems with it when I compared it to the best games in the genre, and when I just looked at it for its own sake, but I found it to be far more entertaining than the average modern adventure/puzzle game. Though I was critical of it, I have found 99% of people who have played it tell me that they enjoyed it. I do suggest that if you like fantasy, adventure, or playing as a female heroine who'sdown-to-earth, that you buy it..."
2,Yakkity Yakkity,"I am an avid adventure game player. Never a fan of the ""shoot 'em up"" genre I long for good plots and challenging puzzles. I had heard good things about The Longest Journey. After playing for little more than an hour I realized something: This game has WAY too much dialogue. Yak yak yak all day long. Boring boring boring. If there is a good story here and an exciting adventure I'll never see it because this April character won't shut her yap."
2,Shut up already!!!,"Nice graphics. Bit corny at times, but that doesnt matter. Great setting, plot and characters. Nice puzzles. However... the dialogue is endless! I read the laudatory reviews and thought... 'well this games a safe bet'.Now I have given up because I cant take it any more!!!At one stage I think I sat in front of the screen for 20 minutes just listening to a single conversation... and it was boring as hell. What was going through the game designers' minds???"
1,"listen up, it does a body good","The end was awful...I'm sorry to spoil it for those of you playing as we speak and expecting some sort of fantabulous conclusion, but I feel that you ought to know that the end and pretty much most of the ""action"" sequences were less than satisfactory. If all you want are mind-boggling (and super irritating) puzzles and an incomplete storyline, yeah, sure, get this game, all you have to lose is (your money), bah...good luck, though, yeah?"
3,Longest Journey - Not worth the cost,The Longest Journey has great graphics and the story line at the beginning is great. But the conversation between characters is too stereotyped and monotonous. And it's somewhat easy if you've played many games.
3,Mixed feelings,"Very beautiful graphics, interesting and different story line, unique puzzles. If it wasn't for the unnecesaary gutter level language in this game, I would have given it 4 stars. Too too much dialogue to wade through and, in some sections, just too much ""walking"" to do to go from point A to point B. I felt like the authors were ""padding"" in order to make the game run longer.The language is very offensive."
5,Best adventure game ever !,"This game is the greatest adventure game ever. It even beats Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island games. It is funny, exciting and really manages to make you care about the characters. Even if you have never played an adventure you should really give this one a try - it might open a complete new genre for you."
2,Im growing weary....,"This game kills me. The dialog is excrutiating. I often play the game by reading a book or magazine while the characters are talking, stopping only to get them going again, and then just read the conversation log. I also have found the puzzles to be either really easy (here is the code... enter the code...with no ""figuring out"") or totally illogical. Like you know the robot is thirsty, why cant you give him the soda? Oh, you have to run to a different place to put it in the paint shaking machine. Why cant April just shake it? I keep playing to see what is going to happen, but I am on chapter 4, and I dont know if I cant stand it much longer. I wonder why an ""adult game"" with profanity and other adult content has such slow action and easy logic puzzles. Who is this game aimed at?"
3,The Longest Dialogue,"An interesting central character (April) who is voiced well, good 2D scenery, and a reasonably fantastic storyline is tempered somewhat by dialogue exchanges that go on forever. Feel free to pluck your eyebrows, do some light reading, exfoliate, whatever quiet activities you may have been putting off, as you wait for dialogue exchanges to go on and on. And on they must go, because April's journey can't continue until the exchanges are completed. As you may know, this game is not American or UK, it was translated from another language in a country where presumably people have much more time on their hands. Just about every scene could have been sped up - as could April's walking speed (even running is too slow). I applaud the designers' efforts to make a complex story, but they clearly needed someone to reign in their excess dialogue and plodding pace."
4,An engrossing adventure!,"I enjoyed this game because it had an interesting storyline, well developed characters, beautiful animation and challenging puzzels to solve! One of the nicest features of the game is that the heroine cannot be killed! It is so frustrating to spend hours playing a game, only to have the main character die, necessitating replaying the game! There is some ""bad"" language in the game, which is why it is rated for mature audiences. There is very little violence. The main character can be sacastic and mouthy occasionally, which made me want to give her a smack, but except for that, the game was a ton of fun! This is a pretty heavy duty game, coming with 4 CD's, and it took over 45 minutes to load it onto my Dell Dimensions 4100! Be sure to read the computer requirements before you buy it to ensure your computer can push this software."
4,Excellent adventure epic,"Somewhat repeating what others have written, this game has beautiful graphics, an engaging si-fi/fantasy story, wonderful voice acting and a fairly good balance of dialog to puzzles. TLJ is a very involving interactive story, so if you know that before-hand and enjoy this style of game it comes highly recommended. One caveat that dropped my rating to 4 stars is the wanton vulgarity of one or two characters that was (IMHO) entirely unnecessary and excessive."
3,Not really the LONGEST journey,"I was somewhat disappointed in this game. It's very much like reading a book or watching a movie. There weren't enough puzzles to solve. When you were given a choice of what to say to someone, you know it really doesn't matter, because April won't do anything she's not supposed to do. I'm a huge fan of adventure/puzzle games of this sort, and I guess I just expected more.On the plus side, you do get very caught up in the story, and the puzzles are challenging but solvable...."
4,Great game!,"Excellent graphics and fun to play. The puzzles haven't been very difficult so far (just starting Chapter 6), but most are hard enough to make the game interesting and challenging. I just have 2 complaints; too much dialogue and too much swearing. If it weren't for the swearing I'd buy it for my 13 year old niece. She would love the storyline, especially with a female heroine."
5,really fun,"this game had lots of puzzles; some were pretty tough, especially since you're bouncing between worlds. but overall, a really good adventure game. one thing about this game that is so awesome is that you cannot die. you can try all sorts of things and you can't be killed; which is nice because you'll never be put back to the beginning of the game or scene."
3,From an inexpeienced gamer -,"I did enjoy the game. But...It was really very talky, especially at the beginning. My mind wandered.I prefer a logical puzzle and some were of the ""throw in the kitchen sink"" variety, which had me searching for the hint sheets. I would never have gotten that first key without them.In general I did enjoy the goings on of April, and really liked Crow. The surprise ending left me wondering if I'd missed something."
5,The Greatest Journey,"One word: Wow.Get this game. Get it for yourself, get it for your neighbors, get it for every person on your Christmas list. If they don't have a computer buy them one just to play this.One more word: Buy."
2,The Longest Journey - Back and Forth Linear Progression,"The graphics are great! Other than that, movement is boring and linear. No excitement. Puzzles are predictable."
5,A step beyond the looking glass.,The best game I have ever played. A storyline that will probably stick with me for a long time. The most amazing adventure game ever.
5,Great Ninja Series,Great series this is the most realistic Ninja series that you will ever see. There are (8)movies in this series I just wish they would've released the whole series together in a box set. This is a most own for any fan of Ninja movies. Raiz Ichikawa who is the star of this series is one of my favorite Actors he is just awesome in this series.
2,disappoited,"I received this fairly quickly, but this product did *NOT* cover my grays. It slightly lightened up my already colored hair, but that's about it. It took me over an hour in the shower to rinse off the sand/grit/rocks/cement and even then I'm not sure I washed it all out. I am not happy with this product, and the fact it did not cover my gray (waited an hour and a half before rinsing,) was adding insult to injury, or uncolored white roots to impossible to rinse off product. Very frustrating."
1,"Huge mess, NO color change at all.","Huge mess, NO color change at all. It did, however, stain the bathtub slightly with its sticky green gray mud."
4,nice trick,pretty good mix of stuff.If your into Electro that flits between experimental to catchy ..You'll like this I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about ..They probably are coming down off crystal Meth or something?
5,A perfect sunrise on a new kind of music,"Fantastic CD - if possible I recommend you get the limited version, as Castaway is ne of the bests songs, imho, that stronkern have ever written, The sound is more polished on this album than previous efforts, although the raw intensity of previous classics such as Heretic remains. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is into EBM/synthpop/darkwave/ whatever else, as it is unlike any other band currently on the scene. The albumis fll of real 'chant songs', the best being Perfect sunrise!"
1,Goth Rap,"I'm not sure when or where Stromkern started gaining hype, but this CD is most definitely nothing to talk about. It consists of very typical beginner industrial music combined with some of the worst vocals put to disc. What makes it even worse is that these vocals are rap. I thought EBM bands trying to sound like trance bands was bad, but I'll take that any day of the week over electrogoth rap."
4,wonderful holiday music,"If you love Freddy Cole and you love Christmas music, then you are sure to enjoy this beautiful combination of the two."
4,"Room, room, and more room!",Have found this to be an excellent choice for the two of us and a massive amount of gear. Very easy setup. Had been using a 6-person dome + 4-person for storage. This setup is infinitely better. Love the head room and being able to walk around. Have had some minor problems with water pooling on the rain fly. Will give another reviewer's suggestion to stake directly to ground a try. Purchased on sale for $130 + free shipping and have been extremely pleased.
1,Inconstent Product Description,"BUYER BEWARE! The product is called Stainless 72"" Shower Hose but the description is 72"" PVC hose with metal hex nuts. Includes 2 pc washers and pipe tape. Do not reward this carelessness - order this product and who knows what you will actually receive!"
5,A great book!,"This book was very knowlegeable for future Black young ladies intersted in acting. She tells it all. I was interested because I wanted to know how our ligh-skinned sisters coped with Hollywood. She tells the dirty things they did to her. There is no difference between the dark skinned beautiful Black sister and the light-skinned beautiful Black sister. They treated every Black like dogs the same way.It awaken my eyes a little, but I knew it was extremly difficult for her and I got to read it from her life.She talks about the men in her life. Yes, they are the same if you are an actress or a waitress.Also, Ellen Holly is history. She is one of our first Black actresses. We should know about her. I was thrilled to know about her.She did a fantastic job with her story!"
3,Just so so.,"It seems like different people get different results with this product. My hair looked shinier after the application, yes. But it wasn't THAT big of a difference and it washed out quickly. I quickly moved on to Brazillian Blow Out products. BUT, hey. If this product happens to work better for you, maybe you could skip a Keratin type product and save money?"
2,Imaginary Space,After having traveled Europe for 3 weeks in a Tote's rolling canvas bag (cost $19.95) - I cannot find reason for this additionala expense nor can I find all that room Steves imagines. Sorry. Returning merchandise.
1,Don't bother,"AS a suitcase, this is a joke. It's too small to function usefully as a garment bag and too gimmicky to function as an ordinary suitcase. Forget it."
5,For demodex mange at reasonable price.,My boston terrier was born with demodex or mange. The vet prescribed a daily dose of .01 ml to treat the skin condition. The amount he sold me was very expensive and only lasted for a month. So for a reasonable price it has lasted almost a year and my doggie is better than ever. I also consulted with a friend who's studying to be a vet and she asured me this is the same as Ivermectin sold on the vet's office.
4,Simple Tool for Simple Jobs,"I had a broken peg in a Cribbage board. Obviously, I simply needed to drill out the remains of the peg. But my aging electric drill would not hold a charge. I had drill bits, but no drill. This simple tool provided a good solution.Amazon shipped promptly but it took the Post Office 10 days to deliver this item. If your in a hurry I'd suggest using one of the 'premium' shipping options."
2,Not my grandfather's drill,"Overall this drill is sturdily made except for one thing...the little black crank handle on the orange gear wheel is plastic! The rest of the drill is solid metal and appears well made. Why put a ten cent plastic handle on the orange gear, in a place that takes lots of wear given that you are cranking that big old orange gear to make the drill work. A lot of pressure is going to go onto this little black handle.For the price of this drill everything should have been metal. I bought an antique Stanley egg beater type drill from an online auction the day after I got this one. I paid $5.24 for the antique drill and received something made out of solid metal, with multiple gears, thus providing more torque and solid wooden handle instead of cheap plastic.If I had bought this drill locally I would have returned it because of the cheap plastic handle."
3,"Well made, but too small","The wheel on this drill is too small to generate enough torque. It works well with small drill bits, smaller than 1/8""."
3,Not very true,In my case I bought the hand drill for delicate work on a guitar. The drill will not be usable because the chuck is not straight. When you turn the crank the drill bit wobbles. This will make a much larger hole than desired. I'm already using a 1/16 bit so I really can't go smaller. I suppose this may suffice for some cabinet building but I would think for something like that you would opt for a power drill.
3,meh,could have two gears to help stabilize the crank arm like my fathers of unknown brand.. not as good as an old one if you can find one.
1,worst drill ever,"I had high hopes for this drill for easy jobs like putting curtains or pictures up, and likedthe idea of avoiding the electric drill.But the problem is that the drill acts like a screwdriver for the drill bit instead of boring a hole likea normal drill. In 5 minutes I had a drill bit stuck in the wall and lots of frustration. Ended upbreaking the drill bit off trying to get it out, so it is still in there, luckily did not wind up bleedingor putting an eye out for this stupid thing.I'm sending it back.I would avoid this thing unless you are giving it to your kid to work on random pieces ofwood that you don't care about."
4,Good tool for drilling areas where exactness is necessary.,This tool is much better for drilling tiny holes in copper jewelry ear rings. The electric drill seems to slip and sometimes the hole is off site. It give more control in exactness.
4,"A must have for any ""prepper.""","When the power grid goes down...you'll be fine. This is a sturdy well built product, it doesn't feel cheaply made at all."
3,Well made product but a little small,"This is a well-crafted product but quite small...almost like a toy. It's small size results in little ability to ""torque"" the drill bit. I would recommend a larger-sized hand drill over this one."
3,Don't have to look for the charger,"It's OK but maybe had I purchased the larger one I would have been more satisfied. The crank wheel (horizontal axis) holder is too small. When you need leverage you are forced to grasp the entire crank wheel, at the same time as you are holding and trying to rotate the crank wheel the vertically rotating shafts gear has a tendancy to pinch and eat your flesh."
5,A great addition to my toolbox,A simple and high quality hand drill. I expect this tobe a long lasting addition to my toolbox. The hand crank and gear are made of metal - cheaper versions tend to have plastic parts. The hand crank turns easily and the drill is thin enough to fit in places an eletric drill can't got.
1,The Quilted Garden,"The new copy I received in April 2010 is not an original edition. It appears to be a ""photocopied"" version (inside back cover shows the date 25 March 2010), and the colour of the pictures is very poor compared to the original. The quality of the paper is also poorer than the original (matt instead of gloss). The cover is the same except without Jane A Sassaman across the top. (The book shown has the author's name across the top so it is probably an original edition.) As my main reason for purchasing the book is to look at the pictures of many quilts, I was not happy."
5,The right toothbrush for cats,"My cat just had his teeth professionally cleaned and the veterinarian suggested that I should brush his teeth. I searched a lot of information online made by veterinarians regarding cat's dental care and they all use C.E.T toothbrush that was designed for cat's mouth. As for the toothpaste, it says seafood flavor on the package, and it is a bit sweet to the taste and no odor at all. Unfortunately, my cat did not find the toothpaste tasty or anything, but I guess it is normal, and I am working on getting him used to the routine of brushing teeth."
3,Bluegrass 182,"This cd really isn't picking on blink 182. It's just a remake of some of blink 182's popular songs into bluegrass. If you like blink and bluegrass, you'll like this cd. If not, then you probably won't like it. It's as simple as that. Blink 182 fans shouldn't be offended by this cd, cause, in a way, it's honoring blink by introducing them to a new audience. I'm not sure if it's the same people, but they did the same thing to the Dixie Chicks (""Pickin' on the Dixie Chicks"") and I thought that cd sounded good too. Take it or leave it, it's all in what you like!"
4,Brilliant....,"although i only listened to the clips, i think this album is fantastic and would be worth a purchase.not a fan of bluegrass one bit, but i dig the new ""spin"" on some of our favorite blink tunes.pops' is a bluegrass fan. i'm a blink fan. he hates my music. i loathe his.i'm thinking this may be a perfect introduction to having him check out some of my cd's.excellent!can't wait until i hear the metallica spins next"
1,Why?,"I just can't understand you people. blink-182 is the best band in the world, and making them into bluegrass is the worst idea I've ever heard. Anybody that would willingly buy this CD either sleeps with his cousins or is seriously messed in the head. Please don't support this ""band"". Please...if you're thinking of buying this album, just burn you money, or throw it away....."
1,Terrible Band,"This band is terrible. If they had any talent at all they could write their own songs and wouldn't have to resort to ""tricking you"" into buying their CDs when you see them shelved under Blink 182 at the CD store. (I really wish stores would store these under a different section... Tributes, Parodies, whatever). The positive reviews below are most likely from friends and relatives of the band or the band itself. Beware!"
1,OMFG WHY,"First off, i can't even listen to this crap because blink-182 is my favorite band and they pretty much KILLED the songs. Although it is nice that they realized blink-182 has been around before ""Enema of the State"" was produced (i.e. songs like ""dammit"" and ""m+m's""). I wouldn't recommend this cd to ANYONE.They wouldn't let me give it zero stars...so i was generous"
1,PLease NO!,"I gave this one star, simply because the site would not allow me to give it no stars. This CD has got to be the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. Why anyone would even want to make blink songs into bluegrass is beyond me. I cringed as I listened, and then took a cold shower to cleanse myself of the filth that I received after hearing this. I for one will be boycotting this ""album""...Who's with me?"
4,Pleased with this Vise,"A little reluctant to buy this becaues it was made in India.When it arrived , I was very pleased.Quality appears excellent .Made a few minor modifications :1) Mounting holes needed a little filing for 1/2"" diameter bolts2) Created small flats on the lower mounting pads to make room for washers under the nuts. ( used grinder )3) Installed 3/4"" oak faces for the viseThe vise is very sturdy and of excellent quality.I would recommend it for purchase."
2,quick release breaks down,I bought 30 of the record vises for my school shop..2yrs. later the quick action mechanism no longer functions properly on 25% of them making them difficult to use.The quick release mechanism is not well designed for continious use.
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought two of these vises for a newly built workbench. They seem to be well built except for the sloppy fit where they bolt to the workbench (not square). I was a little worried when they arrived and the box they came in (from the factory) said ""Anant VICE"". If you are going to manufacture vises you should know how to spell vise. Also, as others have mentioned, the dog in the vise is about 1/4"" to tall and will have to be cut off. Other than these fairly minor problems they are heavy duty and clamp very well."
5,p.o.d. remixed,"As a HUGE fan of P.O.D., I definitely have all their CDs- including this one. I first heard about the ""String Quartet Tribute"" series when I bought the ""String Quartet Tribute to Linkin Park"" CD and absolutely loved it. I then bought this CD for a friend, then decided to splurge and bought it for myself. As of now, I have one thing to say about this CD: ""Wow."" All of P.O.D.'s best songs are on here, including ""Youth of the Nation"", ""Sleeping Awake"" (featured, appropriately, on the ""Matrix Reloaded"" soundtrack), and ""Satellite"". three of my favorite songs from the band. On all of the songs, lead singer Sonny Sandoval shines just like he does on all their other albums. The only thing I might possibly have wrong with this CD is that my favorite P.O.D. song, ""Ridiculous"", isn't on here. Oh, well. Not a reason to drop my rating.The Final Verdict: If you are a fan of P.O.D., you have to get this CD. 1000/10."
5,Awesome oracle!,These tarot cards are wonderful! Great illustrations and meanings. The colorful tin container keeps them from getting bent. Can't say enough nice things about these cards.
2,"Typos, ty@=pos, t=aApos.","I've just begun to read this book, and so far...AAAARRRRRGGGGG!!!!!! There are SO MANY typos I can hardly get through the stories. The stories themselves are just so-so, so far. I don't know if I'll have the patience to get through this mess or not."
3,New on the Scene,"Daniel Barefoot's ghost folklore series aspires to reach the classic storytelling heights of Nancy Roberts, Margaret Rhett, and others. Unfortunately, the stories don't really ever reach those rarified climes.Barefoot's stories are often very short with little development of underlying plots. Most are extremely formulaic ending with a hackneyed ""warning"" about the ghost or spectre such as ""If you're in (such and such a place) on a moonlit night beware (such and such a ghost).""Perhaps the best feature of the book is that most of the stories have not been told before. This provides the reader with some new material rather than reading yet another author's take on the same folk tale. If only the tales had been better and more engagingly told.This would probably be a good read for a parent looking for a ""ghost book"" to read to children. However, for those who truly love southern folklore it is a bit of a disappointment."
3,Not as pictured.,"Cobalt windowpane on the tie was white, giving it less depth in design and a flatness that made it look polyester-like, though it was marked silk. Seller explained what happened and said most likely I'd get the same if it was reordered. Return was handled professionally. Wouldn't hesitate to use seller again."
5,Venom T-10 Body Review,Great Lexan Body and a good price.The Decals that come with the body are the best.I recommend this body to any hobbiest.
4,"Passionate, personal messages from the Mid-East","Through the lens of her own impassioned personal narrative, Orange leads the reader into the troubled heart of this deeply conflicted region. She shows us, up close, the tragedy of Israel's blighted promise, where good intentions are forever at the mercy of ancient hatreds and where the most educated, civilized people on all sides show no compunction about committing (or encouraging, which is the same thing) the most barbaric atrocities. No simplified headline cliches here, no easy division between the ""good guys"" and the bad. Orange takes all this ridiculous tragedy and waste in a deeply personal way (at times you want to shout, ""Why won't these people just LISTEN to each other?"") and after a time the reader does, too."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping to read the personal story of a woman who made aliyah - but found myself laboring through endless descriptions of the authors encounters with Palestinians, her impressions of Palestinians, her interviews with Palestinians .... I read the entire book, hoping to catch a few more glimpses about life in Israel, only to be disappointed. Much more informative and interesting, in my opinion ""A little too close to God"" by David Horovitz."
2,Lightweight and superficial.,"A nice, light read if you're looking for one person's experience living in Israel for a few years; a waste if you're looking for an understanding of the region's politics and the roots of the conflict. Orange may be familiar with Israel's complex history, but if so, she hides it well. The Palestinians she meets are treated with warmth and compassion, but the religious settlers are painted as loony caricatures; Orange is of course entitled to her opinion of them, but she certainly cannot claim to treat each side with equal objectivity--or indeed, with any objectivity whatsoever. Even the Israelis she lives with seem sketchy and barely-there. There is no real in-depth political analysis of the peace process or the logistics of its implementation.If you want to know all about Wendy Orange, this is a great book. If you want to know more about the roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict, or the politics of the peace process, look elsewhere."
4,Just Enough To Peak Your Interest,"Jane Hollander follows the tradition of Draeger and Leung Ting. She writes about every art she can get her hands on, detailing it better than most of the instructors of the style can. Here, she gives a simple guide designed simply to introduce us to the myriad ways that kung fu can be applied. It is not a book for learning exact techniques, but for becoming familiar with basic principles and showing the relationship of various arts which share certain princples. This book gives us the means to see the difference and the similarity, based solely on the basic premises of the styles. To learn more about each art, one would have to get videos & books specifically dedicated to that one art, which would still provide less by way of separate perspectives. This is the type of book that Americans need to help them wade through the confusion of which Chinese art is best for them."
2,Amateurish!?,"The book is a composition of her previous published IKF articles.Information is very general. For novices, it is ok! ... A better book is Asian Fighting Arts."
3,mangelhaft,"Dieses Buch ist weder von der geschichtlichen Darstellung noch von der technischen Seite empfehlenswert und reicht keineswegs an das Werk von Maik Albrecht o.ä. heran. Wenn man dieses Buch als Anfänger in die Hand bekommt, gewinnt man sehr leicht einen verzerrten Eindruck von dieser Materie. Als Fortgeschrittener wird man enttäuscht und als Profi wird man diese Arbeit als überflüssig empfinden. Immerhin ist nicht alles beklagenswert. Einige Passagen sind in Ordnung, weshalb das Buch von mir noch drei Sterne erhält."
1,Nice photos but...,"shame about the text. The book covers a handful of the major styles (that are commonly taught in the USA)and very briefly touches on the history and some characteristics of these styles but says little else. The photos take up probably more space than they should but they are interesting nonetheless. Despite the title, there is nothing complete about this book."
4,Burroughs without A Plot,"This novel reads like some of Burroughs' earlier fictions--for example, The Soft Machine--but without the black humor that the American beat uses to leaven his nasty loaves. With Guyotat we are left with one continuous description of anal and oral rape, usually by soldiers on men and boys. There's no plot as we find in de Sade, no flights of vision or hyper-crazy odes to revolt as in Artaud to make it memorable--only the cubistic clinches of flesh and flesh--the terrible consequences of the weak in the clutches of the strong. This is not a pleasant read and I do not recommend it for the squeamish. I wonder what the author does to relax and have fun?"
2,Overblown and tedious,"The introduction to this book promises that Pierre Guyotat's ""Eden Eden Eden"" will scar you. Unfortunately, for me, it does no such thing. Monsieur Guyotat should have known that an endless barrage of shocking and outrageous imagery, far from scarring the reader, ultimately desensitizes the reader to its violence and sexual perversities. If Guyotat had simply spaced out the violence and perversities in between far less shocking passages, he might have achieved his desired result. I found this book to be so boring and repititious that I gave up somewhere around page 50. In fact I suspect that there's something rather comical about the whole text. Not recommended."
4,interesting... and different.,"This is a good book, somewhat gory, but then, so is the movie. However, there are a number of different plot points that are significant... like the fact that he's going to visit his daughter, not his wife. And it isn't Nakatomi Plaza ;-)The book is more philosophical than the movie. It's also grittier. but it is interesting to see the comparisons... see what the producers of Die Hard changed. Is this the bestest book ever? nope. But a nice read and interesting conversation after.If you are a fan of the movie, this is a nice to read companion."
5,Very Exiciting and inspiring detective book!,One of Roderick's best book. I recommend to any DIE HARD Fan out there!!
4,"Not Die Hard, but not bad","John McLane he is not, but the story is still very entertaining. I read this during a week at the beach and enjoyed it from start to finish. It is a great beach read, not deep, but very entertaining. If you are looking for a novelization of the movie you will be a little disappointed, but if you are looking for a good fun read, then I highly suggest this book."
5,Vranicky Who?,"It's no wonder why Vranicky was well liked by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. He definitely is one of the great forgotten classical period composers. Hard to compete with the aforementioned; but if he lived during any other time, he probably would be better recoginized today. All that said, these symphonies are well thought out pieces. The Op. 52 Sym. is the one I am most drawn to; seems to be the best of the four. Vranicky's style is a mix of Mozart and Beethoven. The courtly feel of Mozart with the stepped up size orchestra and sound of Beethoven. Anyone interested in exploring other great classical period composers, don't let Pavel go bye, you will be missing something."
4,A picture is worth a thousand words,Check out the picture that Deutsch dug up from Germany:http://www.mentalblog.com/hello/271/1249/1024/11-25-2004%208-44-49%20PM_0000.jpgThere he is. The megalomaniac without his yarmulka. It's terrible that chabad at least in some areas (I don't know why I restrict it to some areas I have a feeling that this is rampant everywhere) has a really rotten horrible narcissistic property and backing to it.Until where do its tentacles reach?
2,Waste of paper,"The book can be divided up into bait size to fish, trout, char, trawling and conservation.The writer spends too much time trying to explain with complicated graphs the size of bait to use to catch a size of trout. I can't see a trout using a vernier to size up it's meals.THe book does show how to catch trout ""Trawl for them like pike"" The writer then goes off into planting trees and country side conservation.I felt the writer came accross as having ""a better than thou"" attitude. I have friends that read the book and came to the same conclusion.Rig up a dead bait as you would for pike. Trawl it behind a boat and save yourself the money. There are other and better books out there!"
2,Man Without a Country Entertaining But Slow,"Perhaps Cliff Robertson's best role as Phillip Nolan, the ""man without a country"". Overall, solid but not extraordinary - the film moves slowly, the dialog is occasionally stilted, the supporting cast is workman-like adequate. Yet Robertson's excellent performance makes the film worth seeing - an excellent character study."
5,Life of boy turned girl,"I love Jayne County. I loved Wayne too. This is all about Wayne transforming into Jayne, the true-life tale of a gender-bending rock'n'roll survivor. Jayne describes her early years, as a ""sissy boy"" who dared to wear lipstick in a southern small town during the '60's. Young Wayne was actually shot at by local rednecks. County wisely decided to get out of town, ditching small-town hell for the much more cool NYC, Andy Warhol scene. Jayne describes the influence gender-bending Warhol superstars had on the pre-Ziggy David Bowie. Bowie is described as a hippy who's only saving grace (at that time) was his outrageous wife, Angie. County describes turning down Bowie flat (""He was of no interest to me sexually.""), and un-requited lust for...Rod Stewart! Very entertaining anecdotes about roomates Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis, both Warhol Factory and Max's Kansas City fixtures. Highly fascinating account of her life in Berlin, and transformation from Wayne to Jayne."
2,Missing Vowels,"This book is a rather large dictionary of a reconstruction of Proto Germanic. Those parts that are readable are very interesting. However, for some reason many words have blank spaces where a vowel should be. This is especially pronounced in the words that begin with s. For example, there is an enty *sl wan. The text of the entry relates the proto form to OE sliw, MLG sl , and OHG sl o. I have no idea what the vowels in the proto form and the German forms were. Also, I checked the website of the publisher, and I was unable to find errata. For the price I paid, this sloppy editing is unacceptable."
3,Insightful Book,"This book still has some gems that are useful despite it being out so long. Espescially in terms of product management and marketing. ANother book that is more recent that goes really well with this book is ""Value Acceleration"" by Mitchell Gooze and Ralph Mroz.Value Acceleration: The Secrets to Building an Unbeatable Competitive Advantage"
3,u get what u pay for....,"I bought this to replace my Walmart cd player. Well this cd player is decent, it plays wma, mp3, among others and plays data disc's. It has a good picture. Now the bad: knobs tend to malfunction ( left is right ext). screen will misread your touch a lot. It stops reading discs sometimes.The good: it has a good amount of eq settings. Does have rca cable inputs for your phone, and a aux impute.Would I buy this again knowing all the things I know now? No wait more than no I would rather burn my money than get this junk again."
4,good,very good dvd car player. I bought it because the price and looks. (a pioneer it's twice expensive) let's see if the player will work just it's looks...
2,Very ordinary,"As theatre person Im always open to new ideas.Sorry, but this seems to be one good ideastretched to boring and unenlightening limits.A very Hollywood Im-going-to-write-an-instantbestseller feel to it. Title is about the best bit."
2,Save your time and money - buy something else,"I purchased this wireless network card to replace a Microsoft MN-720. I had nothing but problems and could not get it to work on my wireless network. I thought maybe it was because my router was Microsoft not Belken, so I tried it at work also without success. I returned it and replaced it with a Linksys WPC54GS. The Linksys works great. All I had to do is plug it in. For now on, I'll spend the extra money and get a good product the first time."
3,This card works with Macintoshs too,This card works with the Macintosh. I have had two of these cards stop working and Belkin has both times replaced them gratis. What a company!
4,So lame its Awesome,"Seeing this movie really drives home the fact that the type of film making I associate with the 1980's really lasted untill the mid 90's. This is a film that relies on simple plot elements, lame jokes, some female frontal nudity and a surprise guest musician. It's not really laugh out loud funny, but some scenes should at least get you to chuckle. I don't want to disclose the name of the guest musician in the movie, but his appearance really helps to drive the film over the top. It's pretty predictable but if you're in the mood for something you don't need to even think a little bit about, rent it. Heavy Metal Summer must be the Canadian release title and State Park the American. I doubt there are any differences past the title. This movie is so lame, so awful, so bad, so EIGHTIES that is bloody fantastic, it's filmed in Ontario and even if you hate the movie, the scenery is nice."
1,Never buy again!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Upon receiving this item I tried to use it in the VHS section of my machine. The liquid in the bottle was DRY, and the cleaning tape was all over the cassette. I manually rewinded the tape-but when used in the machine - it simply folded up and jammed in the machine. This was not cheap - but useless. I've ended up still using my old cleaner.As far as the rating of 1 * it is ""0"" stars, but you don't have a category for that."
4,Great Buy,"To start off I am very pleased with this computer. It has many pros and only a few cons. First off The design is a very modern in design. The screen is HD. (however, in comparison with the Sony versions it is in my opinion inferior.) The Hard drive is large enough to hold a lot of Data. The battery lasts for about one hour and forty five minutes. It has a Slot that fits pretty much any kind of flash card that you might have. I have a Sony SD flash card and it works just fine with that. The video card is dedicated so it does not draw from the systems memory. I have tried many games for example Madden 2005 and the newest rainbow six and they run very smooth. I think that this computer is a replacement desktop. Meaning that if you plan on taking it every where you go it might become somewhat of a burden. All and all I love it and I got every thing out of a computer for a very good price."
1,False advertising,I expected a small pack of dvds and all I got was one lousy one in box that looked like someone played football with it. Horrible quality. Never buying from this seller again.
1,Can't take the heat,"Do not attempt top use the container with warm or worse hot liquid's. I used it to try to store a stew. The Lid is very difficult to put on and the container collapsed almost immediately. I don't appreciate having to clean a counter, floor and base cabinet because of such a terrible product. I bought them for the low price but the aggravation factor was not worth it. A bargain their not."
1,Driving Israel into the Sea--A Committment,"This pro-Islamic, anti-Israeli viewpoint, consistent with American media more interested in cheap oil than the plight of Jews, ignores Arafat's committment to ""drive Israel into the sea."" No less determined than Hitler, he claims to be anti-terrorist, while releasing known terrorists from prison to continue Islam's holy war. While Israelis struggle for peace, even conceding land won in a defensive war, Arafat also struggles--not for peace, but for victory in Islam's genocidal war. This video continues Islam's extraordinary propaganda war, portraying terrorists as victims, and victims as perpetrators."
3,A whimsical look at tractor restoration.,A whimsical look at the trials and tribulations of tractor maintenance and restoration from the perspective of an absolute beginner. Entertaining reading but only very basic and sometimes obvious information.
4,Lighthearted and witty,"Roger Welsch looks at the both the trouble and the glory in tractor restoration. He does so with a keen sense of humour, and manages to keep the reader entertained, while educating him on the basics of tractor restoration.I'm a Land Rover owner, and don't restore tractors as such, but I felt right at home with Welsch. Most of the agonies of tractor restoration have their counterpart in LR restoration.This book can be very useful too: The list of things to do to get your wife to allow you to buy even more tractors is very useful, to say the least. I found other ""gems"" too.Absolutely worth it's price."
5,"Nice strap, looks cool.","Really nice strap. Inexpensive, attractive and it holds the guitar up. Too bad my guitar is a piece of crap."
2,No...,"It's called ""Caligula: Reign of Madness"" for a reason. Because all they did was focus on the bad stuff he did and the rumors that have followed him for years. It's good if you're out to know some scandals and have a basic introduction into Caligula. I thought it was completely biased. There was more to Caligula then sleeping with his sisters, and appointing his horse a senator (which by the way is highly debated as not being true) They touched on nothing of him as emperor, and exagerated a bit too much on his personal life, making him worst than he possibly was.The only thing I like is that this video didn't altogether brand him a vicious demidevil who just got up one day and decided to be bad. The professors in this video did explain his reasonings, perhaps even his ""dementia"" and left it open for the viewers to decided on whether he was truly mad, inheritenly evil, or just a very hurt individual. Other than that, I expected more from this video than just a ""scandals"" report."
5,A&E at its best,"I really am a big fan of the A&E biographies, this is another one to add to the collection. I am in love with the story as much as any other. I know that i have a fascination with people's lives but A&E deserves the credit for my interest. They have done it again."
4,The Movies as viewed By An Expert,"I own this autograghed book about the movies and the movie stars. What was most interesting to me was Nick's near stardom of his own. He had a very mature voice and looked almost exactly like his son George. 'course I like his white hair. I used to listen to him early every morning on Cicinnati Radio. I miss you, Nick, old friend."
1,The Philosophical Quest,"I never received the book.I almost failed my class because I didn't have the book. I forwarded my complain to sender and I received a vague answer.I would like to get my money back!!!Thanks,Anna"
4,Works as it should.,"A lot of other campers keep their thermarest rolled up by itself, but since they're not cheap I like to keep them rolled up in something. This fit my thermarest which is the bigger and thicker version of the basecamp I think. Works fine."
2,Extremely poor DVD,"This might have been an interesting film if it were not for the extremely poor quality of the DVD. The transfer looks like it came from a VHS tape. The picture size was for old fashioned TVs; widescreen but not anamorphic. And the subtitle translation was atrocious. If they ever re-release it in a modern high quality, anamorphic form, with accurate subtitle translation, it might be an existential film worth watching. In it's present form, don't waste your money."
4,Recieved Item FAST,"Recieved item faster tahn estimated shipping time, arrived as described, and functioned fine. Excellent and honest seller."
3,Excellent insights,"In typical Tom Wright style, this commentary on Mark contains some interesting insights. Of note are those related to the political milieu. Also, Wright's comments on the kingship of Jesus and the way he guarded that against the assaults of secular rulers has helped me to better understand Mark's gospel."
3,"Fun music, recording quality second rate","I've been a Gentle Giant fan since I first heard ""Playing the Game"" in 1975 from the Power & Glory album. As that song and the Missing Piece album are some of my favorites, I was excited about them being included on this live album. Although the song selection and performance by the group is great, the quality of the recording is second rate at best. This album should still qualify only as a bootleg. If you want a quality LIVE Gentle Giant album, stick with ""Playing the Fool""."
4,Excellent Information For the Patient and Caregiver as well,"This book is not an ""easy read"" because it's really meant to be read by medical professionals, but it's chock full of extremely valuable information and explanations. When a doctor tells a CKD patient to cut back on sodium, potassium, protein, and so forth the explanation of why, what's happening, what effect will the present unchecked diet have is often very vague. I am a care giver in that I do the cooking for a CKD patient. To understand the function (or lack of function) of a failing kidney, and to understand why these things become important, is important to me. So while I skipped most of the chemistry, I got some very valuable information and was able to ask more informed questions at the next nephrologist's visit."
2,Awful. Buy if you like disappointment.,"I'm a huge 311 fan, bought this to complete the collection and support the cause. Worst CD ever, all it does is provide the motivation you need to crank the original albums. It's a shame because if it were done right, it probably could have been pretty good, instead you'll feel like a retard playing it. You can't even fall asleep to it because you'll be too annoyed and aggravated."
4,A 311 fan's must have!,"This instrumental compilation of 311 songs dating back to their self-titled album is a great listen! Although the lyrics in 311's tracks are a very intrical piece to their overall vibe and style, the String Quartet does a great job of capturing the core of 311's sound. A good buy if you are a 311 junky! Enjoy"
1,A review of another author's book,"This document does not give you any information about the publishing world. I thought it would be an informative short book. Very disappointed that someone would ""sell"" this article."
4,solid and dependable,I have had many cordless phones in the past = I found this panasonic to be solid and dependable even with 2 preteens and my wife abusing them constantly and daily. BAttery life is great - I like the share phone number between handsets feature - nice ring tone options - no complaints - have had these for 10 months now.
4,A nice compliment to a Yoga Library,"This book is a nice compliment to a Yoga Library. I am new to the practice of Yoga, and this book has a few interesting little insights to the practice. It also in the back has a description of how to do some of the poses. I did enjoy the dialogue portions of the book as well."
4,Generally good,"Rodney Yee is a lovely guy and his videos are good, but I was a tiny bit disappointed with this book. I like how it's laid out into different programmes, but I think the instructions focus a bit too much on the 'feeling' of the asanas (though very important). I would have liked some more basic instructions on how to do the asanas."
2,"Yoga is good, the psyco-yoga babble is not","The good:I am always pleased to see a man teaching yoga... all the classes I have taken have been by women and all the books I have read have had women doing the poses--this is fine if you are a women, but as a man I prefer to see it from a man... I hope that makes sense.Excellent photos (albeit small)New takes on positions I have not seen beforeNice workout sequencesExcellent quality to the book manufacturingThe bad:The babble between the workouts is excruciating to read... 1 page, has the co-author's personal dating ad!It is just yoga folks... all of the hippie, existential psycho babble I don't need-- I have enough of my own.I noticed they are selling a card set of this book--that is what I should have bought and if you want to avoid the 75% of the book that is 'interviews', get the cards."
3,Good for learning poses --- but the rest is not so great.,"I love Rodney Yee and I love his videos. But I was a tad disappointed in this book because, while it showed all the most important Yoga poses, it took off on subjects that to me at least were uninteresting and the format of the book sucks. It's done in a conversation between the two authors. I personally don't like that style of writing. I know Playboy did that and perhaps still does (are they around?) but I never liked it.Having said that, however, it's a good book and if you need to learn the poses, you'll like it. In addition, a lot of constructive things are said about yoga. How it helps. It's limitations, etc.But I guess I was hoping for more from this wonderful, prolific leader of yoga. Maybe next time."
1,Morose reading--like slogging through mud,"Wow. I only made it to page 48 in this book. It is so blah and depressing. This is the opposite of a book you'd read for pleasure. It seems as though the author was trying to be poetic and dark, writing ""literature"" that sees into the sordid and lonely soul of the world's singletons.Interestingly, the voice of the book sounds like a guy, even though the character is supposed to be a woman. So, maybe the male author should have written his character as a man, since he can't convincingly do a female voice. In fact, it seems as though he, himself, is lonely, mourning his last breakup, and channeling it into this depressing, repellent fiction. Skip this one. Unless you like to punish yourself."
5,I love Britax...They are the Best!,"I bought this carseat when my daughter was 6 months old. She is now 3yrs old and This carseat is this working great! The installation with the latch is so easy! Adjusting the strap is fast, never had a problem taking off the cover to wash it or anything. I recently had another baby and I was thinking of giving the new baby my 3yr old Britax Marathon seat and buying a booster for my 3yr old. I got the Eddier Bauer high back booster...It took forever to install and the latch was a piece of crap! I took it back and bought my 5 month old her own Britax so that my 3yr old could keep her Marathon. Its worth every penny people...It really is!"
5,AWesome CAR SEAT BAD representation of color,"I was so excited to order this seat, i loved the britax companion and was sure i would love this one too. I ordered the All star blue shown as a gorgeous aqua blue and was really disappointed in the actual color of it. Its really gray in color and nothing like the picture they have on their site. which was the main reason i picked this print. but thats the only negative thing my son LOVES this seat its really comfy and he loves falling asleep in it definitely not like store brand ones. the comfort and safety provided definitely makes it worth the price.So basically love the seat Hate the color of the true all star blue (the should call it gray)"
3,Great for Collector,"This is a great campaign expansion for the collector or completist. I purchased this once in the late 90's and wasn't overly impressed by it, and recently purchased it again and found it to be slightly useful. Although it contains information about the Abyss, it does not provide a lot of detail for running a blood war related campaign.One of the better things about this box were the possible adventures for each plane- with one for low level and one for higher level characters (if I remember).The artwork and quality of design are great- I enjoyed simply looking through it."
4,THE WAR OF NORTHERN AGRESSION REVISITED,"AS A TRUE SON OF THE SOUTH, I APPLAUDE MR. JOHNSTONE'S VIEWS OF THIS TRAGIC PERIOD IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE. IT NEVER WAS A WAR ABOUT SLAVERY, BUT A FIGHT TO PRESERVE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THEIR HOMELAND. BEFORE THE WAR, THE STATE HAD FINAL SAY IN WHAT WAS DONE WITHIN ITS BORDERS. AFTER THE WAR, RIGHT, WRONG, OR INDIFFERENT, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD AND DID HOLD SUPREME. MANY SAW THAT AS A RETURN TO WHAT WE FAUGHT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR TO ESCAPE. SERMON OVER, AS USUAL, MR. JOHNSTONE DELIVERS A ROUSING GOOD TALE OF A LEGENDARY HERO, A SURVIVOR OF THE ALAMO AND A MAN DESTINED TO WALK WITH GIANTS. GREAT FUN AND MORE THAN A LITTLE HISTORICAL ACCURACY."
1,Talons of eagles,I guess if you are interested in the Civil War you might have some interest in this book. For me and my personal taste it left a lot to be desired. Very repetitive and boring. I finally got to page 162 and put it back on my library shelf.I have read a lot of Johnstone and this is by far the worst.Carl EcklundSan Diego
3,Unique,"This is a unique piece and I do enjoy it immensely. Good weight, very interesting cut stone. My only problem is the ring sits too high for my liking. If you like this kind of thing then this ring is for you. I believe the store even carries it in other colors...well worth a look-see."
3,love-hate relationship,"I truly have a love-hate relationship with this ring.It looks really beautiful and I must admit that I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. On the other hand tho, it is very impractical (but that's kinda obvious) and even worse, the ""stone"" fell out (without me noticing) very soon (it was sorta shaky before and it was bound to happen sooner or later)......but I still bought it again just to have it (which is, believe it or not, not something I usually do)... so there you go..."
1,Beware!,"The ring is pretty, but the stone fell out within two weeks. I only wore it a few times. I definitely do not recommend it."
1,Synth the Music Right Out,"Between the synthesizers and the drumming, the music of John Huling's flute has been sucked completely out. New Age mish-mash at its worst. Might be suitable for the Relaxation rack at Target or Wal-Mart. Some nice photographs."
5,Very Well Deserved!!,"I first saw the Warren Brothers as judges on Nashville Star. They look like county rockers with a sense of humor. I just bought there CD and it totallly rocks!!! Every song is a winner and could stand alone as top 10 singles. Every song is a favorite of mine. I just love Goodbye to Neverland, the tune and lyrics go deep to your soul. I would pay good money to see the Warren Brothers in concert. This CD is the absolute best by far. My husband doesn't like country at all, but he likes this CD and listens to it often. That says a lot!!! The Warren Brothers are totally hot, with a bad boy image (very nice) and I hope your next CD rocks with as much awesome power and soul and this one. Great job!!!! Love you guys."
4,what do i do?,"Hello Tom, I haven't actually read your strategy guid yet but I have a question (sorry for not reading it yet!)Um.. Im on mission six in Rainbow Six where you have to rescue the hostages. Well I can only find two, could you tell me where the others are?Thanx, Nolan"
4,Very lightweight...,"I was suprised how lightweight this battery was compared to the one I was replacing. It makes the phone much more comfortable to wear on my belt. Overall, I am very happy with the Nokia cell phone battery performance!"
2,poorly organized and edited,"I've climbed Mount Washington several times, so I looked forward to reading this book. The writer seems a likable sort, but sheesh! The book meanders aimlessly, with meteorological information sprinkled about in a hit or miss fashion. an effect increased by the fact that my copy goes from pages 1 to 216, followed by pages 185 to 216, followed by pages 249-280. Tarcher/Putnam should be ashamed."
3,"Well, they tried...","This CD is ok, some of the songs are in the wrong key (Going Under, and some others), but they tried. I mean, I can picture Evanescence's music being played classically better than most other bands..."
1,No. Way.,"It's a String Quartet, I'll agree with that. But it's not the kind of music one expects when dealing with a band like Evanescence. Amy Lee is a beautiful pianist -- if anyone, it should be her doing the instrumentals, not a strictly classical string quartet.This CD had no emotion. No substance. Not recommended."
1,"Ouch, my aching ears","Okay, I'll admit to only having listened to the audio clips they have here. That was enough. The tuning was TERRIBLE, and every off-pitch note just sent raw needles through my eardrums and down my spine.I'm a musician myself, and I admit to being more sensitive to pitch than most people, but really....if you're going to do a recording like this, do it right. Do it professionally. And try not to make grown women cry."
1,WHAT?!?!,I'm a big fan of Evanescence but srry 2 say but this is not a good cd at all! I think it ruins everyone of the songs on the Evanescence CD.srry but i think it sucks.
2,Well...,"So, if you wanted an awesome instrumental album of Fallen that you could sing to, or maybe a full blown orchestra, this is not the cd for you. I was disappointed to discover that this was more novelty than anything. I Dont recommend this album. :("
2,O... kay,"Going Under (1.5/5) It starts out good, but then when it picks up, it just sucks.Bring Me to Life (2/5) This one starts out okay, and stays okay but it just isn't right. Especially when it gets to the chorus.My Immortal (2/5) It sounds pretty good. One of my favorites by Evanescence. But, the way these people did it, it sounds like a depressing wedding march.Imaginary (4.5/5) One of the best on this CD.Haunted (3.5/5) Another good one.Hello (5/5) It's a beautiful cover. Starts out wonderfully and holds true throughout.Taking Over Me (5/5) Starts out beautifully. A great cover, also.Whisper (10/5) My all-time favorite Evanescence song and this is a great cover.This CD starts out kind of lame, but it soon picks up. It's weird. But, if you're a die-hard Evanescence fan, you'll love the whole thing."
2,Not Even a Diehard Fan Could Really Enjoy This,"One of the very best things about Evanescence is the beautiful vocal strength of Amy Lee. There's a difference in just about all of their songs - a piano in one, plain guitar in a another, some techno touches in another. The lyrics of Evanescence are.. breath-taking.This ""tribute"" strips Evanescence of all of that. The singing, the variety, the lyrics. Not that it's bad, it's just.. Not as great as the real Fallen CD. On most of the songs, it feels like emotionless scratching of a tune.The only way you could really care for this CD is if you're a fan of the strings. That or if you've never heard Evanescence before. But personally, I suggest you save you money and either buy some other orchestrated CD or the real Fallen CD."
1,This was awful,"I love Evanescence and I am also a classical music major. This was terrible. This string quartet just couldn't hack doing something like this. You need the drums and the guitars. Arranging this music for a string 4-tet is a bad idea, which is clearly shown. Now if the Trans-Siberian Orchestra did this, I believe it would turn out better."
2,Great for non-Evanescence fans,"This CD is great for classical music fans and string quartet fans. I suggest getting it only if you haven't heard the real Evanescence, or you haven't heard much of them. I've heard a lot of Evanescence, so the CD kind of ruins the image of Evanescence. I really think that the writer of the string quartet arrangements for Evanescence could of done a better job. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad CD, and I myself am a string player, it's just not close to the real thing."
2,Needs more Escence,"I agree with everyone else. This could have been a lot better than anyother string tribute for any other band. I feel like if this could have been professionally produced and planned. This could have riveled Metallica's famed CD. It needs an entire Orcestra, and If they want to really flare it up get Amy to sing. But we may have to wait until there are more albums for this to work. A greatest hits album will probably be the thing to do."
4,interesting,"I dont think most people today are used to real instruments so when they hear an album like this they respond negatively. This isnt the first time I hear ""classical"" versions of a popular music (Nine Inch Nails, Tori Amos etc) I have even heard Classical music versions of video games like ""The Legend of Zelda"".Hello is probably the prettiest track on this CD and if you are a DJ you might find the instrumentals handy to use. The nice things about classical versions of popular music is to hear that the music can stand on its own and still be beautyful. On a scale of one to five I give this album a four."
3,More than a little robotic...,"I love Evanescence enough that I enjoyed most of this CD, but you really have to be a fan to get much out of it. There's just such a lack of artistry and emotion involved on the part of the musicians, they sound like staccato robots...All in all it feels very much like a hop-on-the-bandwagon maneuver to cash in on a breakout band, but it's still quite an interesting listen."
3,...not bad,"I don't think that this CD is as bad as everyone else thinks it is, but then again, I have an obsession for anything Evanescence. True, the essence of Amy's voice is hard to capture, but I think that's really the best that can be done with a string quartet. I would suggest this CD to anyone as crazy about Evanescence as I am, but not to those who are immensely picky about sound. Personally, I prefer the Fallen CD just because I love the lyrics and the piano for My Immortal and Hello."
4,screw everyone I say bravo,"I'd advise you to buy this. Every one else is probably talking crap due to the fact that it's classical music, and not rock they're typically used to hearing. If you're openminded to the idea of listening to something different yet beautiful then buy this cd."
2,Yuck,"I loved the idea of strings playing Evanescence songs. I love violins and cellos and so I was very excited about getting this cd and hearing my favorite songs being played on my favorite instruments.It was just...disgusting. It sounded off-key, and I'm nearly positive the quartet threw in extra notes. I wanted to try singing to these instrumental versions, but the extra notes kept throwing me off. I imagined that the instruments would be softer and follow more of how Amy sings rather than the drums and other instruments, but they did go more for the music rather than the singing when interpreting Evanescence's songs. The music was just too harsh. Harsh is good in rock, but not with many violins."
2,sorry to disappoint...,"The string playing is absolutely atrocious.The idea behind the disc is great, but seriously, the group is not dead; do they really need a tribute?I thought it would be a good investment...stick with the real Evanescence disc's and decent string quartet playing - like the Emerson string quartet."
3,"Close, but no cigar...","Being a musician myself, The String Tribute to Evanescence is an okay cd when you're just in the need for background music. Some songs like ""Going Under"" are pretty good, while other songs like ""Bring Me To Life"" are too jarring for the ears used to hearing Paul McCoy belt out his lyrics intertwined with Amy Lee's and getting a messy carchophonic scrawl on an electric violin. Of course, considering the newness of Evanescence, there isn't a whole lot of pieces to choose from unlike, say, Tool. Regardless, the quartet does what it aimed to do, though it does leave you wondering how often have they played the original songs beforehand."
1,Not that great,"As a diehard Evanescence fan, I tried without previewing. At least I know not to make that mistake again. The strings version just didn't flow as well. Unless you know Evanescence's songs backwards and fowards, sometimes the melody is hard to pick out and it sometimes just sounds like a million stringed instruments decided to each play a different random note at the same time. I would suggest borrowing a copy rather than buying one."
1,Please god make it stop.....,DO NOT BUY THIS CD UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WASTE MONEY AND LISTEN TO BAD MUSIC! I am a very big fan of Evanescence but this cd is just sad!I mean it was just very empty and non-feeling unlike there original music. Some notes were so high I thought my eardrums would explode. Evanescence you can do better!~~
3,Too small for acoustic guitars,"I gave the case 3 stars because it is a GREAT case, and a great value for the money. HOWEVER, it fits only smaller classical guitars, not regular acoustic. It would be helpful if the company put the case measurements online. The rep I spoke with was super helpful in the exchange for a better-fitting case, and said he was going to suggest measurements be included in the online description. I will continue to do business with this company, and look forward to receiving the correct cases."
5,Impressive Case for the Money,"I purchased this case for my Cordoba C5 from Amazon.It arrived well-packed in a large box with lots of padding. The case also was inside a bag to further protect it and keep it clean.The case is very nice, with plenty of soft padding inside. There's ample space for accessories in its storage box. The Cordoba C5 fits very snugly with no wiggling.I have confidence that this case will keep my instrument safe."
5,Great case!,"This is a fantastic, very professional-looking case. I highly recommend it. It's built tough and has very soft inner black padding. My classical is a BIT too small for the case, but i don't have a single guitar that fits absolutely perfect even in a case made specifically for that guitar...there's always a bit of wiggle room and it's not a big deal. I feel this case rivals more expensive cases by far. You can't beat $50.00! Buy it! You won't regret it."
3,Case barely fits guitar,The case itself looks great! However...it barely fits my girlfriend's guitar (it was a gift) and I would have known better had the seller included dimensions for it to assure the buyer's guitar does in fact fit. This item is very large and sending it back would be very costly.
4,Good value for money,"I bought this for my 10 year old. Even though, I like it and I think it is good value, just little heavy for my daughter to carry it. Overall, its great."
5,"Great case, great price!",Very nice case. I'm a bit amazed at the price and it includes free shipping to top it off!
1,Dimensions not as listed,I bought this case for my Alvarez Regent series RD16CESB Dreadnought acoustic electric dimensions:41 x 15.8 x 4.2 inches it would not fit lenght or width my Yamaha 12 string wouldn't fit either. The outside dimensions of this case are less than what is stated. Other than that it is a very nice well made case for a smaller guitar.
1,Petaluma,THIS ITEM IS NOT A BOOK! It's a AAA road map of Petaluma! ...[Wanted to let consumers know that this is a map and not a book! I was very disappointed because nowhere in the description is it ever mentioned.
4,Great new fantasy.,"This is a surreal fantasy/sci-fi set in rural Ireland. A local Teendiscovers that time is leaking from his world into the world of Fairy or Tir na nOg. There is also a great mystery element regarding JJ (the teen's)grandfather and the sudden disappearance of the town's Preacher after a disagreement many years ago.This might be a hard sell for some teens, but they won't regret reading it!"
3,Immemorable,I remember liking this (I actually just read it) but now I don't remember much about it. Ireland and music and the faerie world but now... yeah.. it's gone... and I just read it two weeks ago. I guess that is not a very good sign.
4,Great Fun,"I bought this for my 10 year old son. He can do many of the tricks very well. The dvd is great for teaching. I only give 4 out of 5 stars because the tricks on the video are the easy ones and only about 10 of them, the other 90 tricks are in book format and alot harder to perform. The quality is great."
4,50/50,Some of these tricks are fun and are hard to figure out how they do it. Others are cheesy. Fun for the price. My daughter liked that the dvd came with it. This way she could learn the tricks on her own and do a show for the family..mom and dad included.
3,Christmas gift,It was a Christmas gift for my grandson in the 4th grade. At first he was unsure and then as he examined the magic set he became more and more excited and plans to put on a magic show.
2,Not great,"The quality is not what I expected. It looks cheap and I regret buying it although I hope the little boy I gave it to, will enjoy it."
3,Missing parts,"I got this for my 8 year old grandson. In general, he's had some fun with it. There is a trick in the book and on the video where you make bunnies multiply. Unfortunately, the little spongy bunnies were missing from the kit. Also, since this kit is geared toward children, I think the fake thumb should be a child sized one, not a large adult size. The video was fun to watch and does help a lot in learning the tricks and how to interact with the audience as you perform your magic. The book included some pretty neat and simple tricks needing no special props at all. All in all, not a bad buy for the money."
4,Lots to do,"Purchased this for my 9 year old nephew for the holidays, and he was pretty excited about it. There is a lot to do, but beware of many moving parts."
3,Okay Product,"I thought my 6 year old daughter would like this more than she did. She played with it once, thought it was corny, and hasn't looked at it since."
3,granny,"granddaughter got this for x-mas,not worth the price and poor quality,you can tell it was not made in America ,"
3,Great film - good DVD,"For any Spaghetti Western fan, this WildEast DVD is yet another must buy. While the transfer isn't up to the one they did for Day of Anger, it is still quite good and the DVD offers some nice extras. The film boasts quite a number of influencial people of the genre and an entertaining story. Recommended[...]"
5,A great camera!,"This camera is affordable and takes pictures that parallel that of my Cannon Powershot 8MP camera. The screen is large, and the video is great! This is an excellent product!!"
4,Great Pretend Toy!!,"I like the fact that the mirror ""talks"". My young daughter plays dress up and likes to play with the mirror along with fake make-up and dress up.It is fluffy and pretty!!"
2,Mislabeled,"Despite the description and the label on the bottle, what I received was definitely NOT mint flavored."
2,Cheap,"Its a clock and it serves its purpose by telling time. But the reason i got it was because of the image. It was supposed to be a gift for a friend who enjoys art history, particularly this piece which was replicated by the Romans. The picture of the clock here looks great and wonderfully detailed but what you get is a coloring book cartoon-like image that looks very cheap and stupid and i would be too embarrassed to give this quality or artwork to anyone let alone display it in my own house. I should have been more careful. If you want a simple cheap looking cutsie clock, this is just fine, but due to the subject matter I expected something more refined."
1,The song doesn't remain the same.,"There is a long history behind the original LRB losing their title, when some original members left and (non original)guitarist Steve Housden kept the name. Listening to this album is like fingernails across a blackboard, after listening to the originals. Music purists listen to an album for their favorite riffs, and perfect harmonies - these are missing on this album. While the songs on this album are well sung, quite simply, it is not the original LRB. If you want the original, look for Shorrock, Goble, Birtles, Pellici etc. Even those albums with John Farnham on lead vocal, (when Glenn Shorrock left the first time,) and David Hirschfelder on keyboard, are well worth a listen.This is second class stuff."
5,Perfectly Arranged!,"Absolutely Marvelous! Totally smooth and enjoyable, every song a winner.This LRB is awesome!"
5,about time this superexcellent CD gets distribution,"I got this CD about a year ago when Dolorean was still self-distributing (yes that makes me more indie-cool than you, sorry!). Great song-writing, this is a band that clearly cares about crafting good, moody, low-key tunes and spicing things up with interesting textures (cello is a nice touch)"
3,Black Light,This isn't a bad black light unit but it is dim compared to others I have used. It will eat batteries fairly quickly so be ready for it.
3,Good for general use.,"The light works i.e both the UV and regular portion. The UV portion was too weak to observe pet stains and the battery compartment was difficult to open and the battery polarity directions were difficult to see. All in all, it would be great for use in a bedroom for a secondary light source."
3,this product ok,The product works ok - just had alot of trouble putting the plate back on once the batteries were in. It is a very tight fit and it's hard to see how the four batteries should go in the light.
1,Black light makes me blue,"I have a male cat that periodically thinks my office is his to claim and he will spray somewhere. I've heard that black light'swill show where the spot is. This product isn't strong enough, even in the total darkness to show anything more than a piece oflint or a speck of paper. It was a wastle of my money for what I wanted it for."
1,Not effective for locating cat urine,"Like many others, I bought this because I was hoping it would make locating cat urine easier. However, after using it diligently, I have to say that, given how close the light must be to the stain, it is no easier than simply putting your nose to the floor -- in fact, I often located the urine stain by the smell first, and only used the light to confirm its presence, which my nose had already done."
1,Broke in an hour.,Within an hour of having it out of the box it stopped working. The wiring on the inside came undone and i won't be able to fix. Piece of junk.
1,Not Very Bright,This blacklight does not light up any amount of area. Even the flashlight end is weak.I bought this item to look for scorpions and organic materials. The blacklight doesn't function well for these uses.
5,blacklight,worked great worked like it should have use it in my bathroom since my 7 year old doesnt hit toilet everytime
1,doesn't work,junk light is dimm even in total darkness & light at end doesn't work at all. Could have sent it back but it would have cost more than the product so i tosed it. Steer clear
2,there must be something better out there,"I bought some glofish (fish that glo in the dark while under a black light). I was in search of a 6"" handheld blacklight at a reasonable price with shipping to use for this. Here was as good as I could find. It requires 4 AA batteries (not included) and has a VERY DIM light. There is a regular flashlight option as well. The size is good, but the quality of the light is not at all at what was expected. It reminds me of a flashlight when the battery is dying."
3,"Hardware ok, Company stinks","Our company purchased 12 of these for our salesmen.Mysteriously at month 11 of a 12 month warranty, the mice went banannas.This was THE most painful repair process I have ever gone through.Viewsonic refused to repair these, knowing this was a common defect, until I came up with proof of purchase for each one.There are many other fine tablets out there, find one of them instead."
5,Great unit...,"It would have helped if the customer who did not like this unit would have given his reasons for not liking it. I have one of these and yes, the stylus operation does take a little getting used to, but the unit itself is awesome. The battery lasts a long time between charges, the screen is easy on the eyes, the speed is fast enough... For a compact portable unit, I think it is great."
2,Still waiting...,"I ordered this in mid-october 2005 and had the with the screen when I recieved it. I called about the problem the day after I noticed it(about 2days after.)I sent it out the next day (insured mail $25). I called several times with many 2 hour waits. They took a long time ""repairing"" it and I finally got it back. It was missing the stylus and I had to go out and purchase another. They said they will send me one I am yet to recieve it. I noticed my computer seemed to not have been even touched. I called again and after 2 hours on hold they told me to send it back. This is when I made a big deal about it, I did not want to pay so much and wait so long again. I demanded a replacement and after I got them to agree I sent it out and they recieved it about 20 days ago. I was told this process would take less than 10 days, so much for that. I rate this product with a 2 because I like all of it's features and price, the only problem is the quality and assistance. Buyer Beware!"
1,OMG DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,i bought this item for a cheap price and now i know why. Just take my word for it and never buy this item. I gave it one star because the screen is ok.
1,Waste of money,This DVD contains only a few dance moves that are poorly explained and poorly demonstrated. It is not worth buying.
1,Useless,"What a joke!! The DVD should literally be titled ""Disco-Fox"". DVD has three sections: Intro; Foxtrot;Disco-Foxt Intro is a verbal narrative about dance. Foxtrot section shows about 5 moves: Basic foward/backward; Zigzag; Right Pivot turns; without narrative. Viewer has to guess at timing. Disco-Fox is the emphasize of the disc. Lots of moves with narration throughout. Useless to me becuase I've never seen it in any ballroom dancing before. Viewer can choose between English and German, so I assume it's for European dancing."
3,Could be better,It did not take long for the jade pieces come out of the silver holders. The jade did not appear to be of good quality either. I am disappointed and hesitant to purchase jewellery online again.
3,Glossy version of getting things done.,"I though the book was a good quick read. As you will see in other reviews, the book tended towards generalities. It's key ideas are excellent, but not new. The linkage bewteen vision, strategy, and operational plans is well done. There are a lot of annecdotes, and some numbers and examples. The book tends to stay in the rarified air of CEO strategy. The book draws heavily from the GE experience and on information in Welch's books.I also saw strong parallels to the topics discussed in the Malcolm Baldrige criteria (linkage, strategy, plans, resources) and systems thinking (Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline).I think this is good as an introductory book and in providing context, then move on to other books for the meat of the subject."
1,Suckests suck suck that ever sucked...,"I'm not really one to write reviews, but I just wanted to help others save there money. I bought this book on CD and thought my CD player was broken since I had to listen to the same message over and over again which was equivalent to my Nike poster I hung above my computer when I was 20 years old. That is ""Just Do It!"". The poster at least had nice design and a snappy logo, this book has neither. I gave the book to a person I secretly despised to waste there time."
3,Stop reading these books and get to work!,"The typical, though well written, common sense that any farmer or housewife knows. This type of book is,in my opinon, the glaring reason for the costly mistakes we see going on in business today.Hire the right people for the job, duh,, would you hire a gardener to shampoo your rugs? Write follow up letters? Is that like sending a thank you card? ""Thank you for doing your job, yeah, the one we pay you for, oh, if your work is not completed get right on it ok?"" Here's my two cents,(about what my opinions worth),Know your business,,NOT what every other business is doing, have pride as a manager in your product, and your people. Question everything, including your CEO, if you are a CEO,and your entity is bleeding capitol, loosing market share, laying off talent, think; ""am I doing my job?"" If the plumer can't fix the leak in your bathroom, should he be paid? Do you want him to read a book ABOUT fixing your pipes? or do you want him to FIX the leak?"
3,Mas o Menos,"I guess I had high hopes for this book. And don't get me wrong, its a good strong book with great ideas. But I have already read this book. Just with different names. I guess its like when someone tells you a movie is great, it can't help but be a let down. I had a few people tell me how wonderful this book was. I can only guess that people told them the book was going to be bad. Still, worth reading if you don't know the points the book covers...."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"The book is real crap, I am sure that the guys who gave good marks to these books have never been in management.Want a good read...look somewhere else. same B.S. as all wrtitten by his pal Jack Welch."
3,Basic Knowledge...,A lot of materials in this book can be found in my 1st year management course in University of Toronto textbook... This book doesn't have much to offer in my opinion; but it's a bit bias for me to critize this book hence my background.
2,Boring,"Sorry, this audio puts me to sleep, I have never tried audio books and most likely wont again BUY A BOOK"
1,"If you understand finance, you won't enjoy this book.","If you understand finance, you won't enjoy this book. Within the first few chapters, the author argues that financials should not be taken into consideration when making a 'top-level' decision. Interesting."
2,B o r i n g,"I think that there's gold in this book. But it's awfully hard to listen long enough to find it. It's read by several people: the co-authors plus a professional? They cut in at various points and take up the monotone. Oops, monologue. Curiously, the co-authors are better than the professional?There are 2 kinds of business books, from what I can tell. One type, like ""Good to Great,"" takes data, and conducts research to spot keys to success. This book takes two successful people (better than one, I guess) and lets them tell why they think they were successful. No real testing outside of th authors. So let's call this a biography, with lessons that hopefully will apply to you."
3,Universal truths presented but people views flawed,"I thought there were many good take-aways in this book. Was it all original? Of course not. Most management books are saying the same things with a slightly different twist. I've got a bookshelf full of them. However, it seems that humans are so often incapable of remembering the fundamentals and have a tendency to overcomplicate things thus history repeats itself over and over.The tone of the book regarding people gave me a little pause. Although I do think they were spot on in their assessment of how many companies do succession planning (not at all or incorrectly), it does seem to advocate that everyone needs to be a mini-Jack Welch type persona. I've worked in a company managed by ex-GE guys and believe me, they don't have it all figured out. I think organizations will benefit by having a mix of skills. Some people are better doers and others are better thinkers. Some superstars are good at both. It takes all types."
4,Beyond Talk,"So many times in this marketing-focused world, we do very well at the talking but not very good at the walking. Many of us have seen amazing sales presentations . . . only to realize that the promises would never be met.This book engages us in the discussion about how to do what we promise. It helps us to go beyond the sales presentation and really design a process by which we can follow through, build relationships and live a life that is full of integrity and trustworthiness."
4,Excellent and readable presentation,"I found a lot of helpful ideas and concepts in this book: many of them immediately applicable. Business is a lot of things but, in the end, it's about doing something. This very readable book helps you see the entire chain of `doing' and break it down to quantifiable steps. Mostly I think the book helps you focus in on your business and think hard about your product or service. This focus helps to clarify your processes and goals - whether they are in house framing or motel management - and create plans to do things better. Another thing I like about the concept is that this focus helps you to weed out those things that don't contribute to efficient `doing.' There's admittedly not a lot of groundbreaking stuff here but the presentation is excellent and it's always a good time to look over the basics again."
2,"Good Stories, but harder than it sounds","This was a quick read on a hot afternoon, full of anecdotes and war stories based on experience at GE and elsewhere. Accountability, clear strategy and honest assessment and reward of people never go out of fashion. For the reader wanting to know why any of this works, wanting to look at alternatives (which the authors don't acknowledge) or interested in the pitfalls and how to avoid them, look elsewhere."
3,Great Title but Lacking Execution,"I would have to agree with a previous review that this book could be better. Bossidy and Ram, do not get into any type of detail on how to get things done. Bossidy must have more personal experiences he could have shared with us. The one-two punch with Larry and RAM doesn't work well at all. Solid concepts but lack of execution!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book fails to even come close to broaching a new topic. Further, its hawking of Six Sigma has the feel that it was ""copy and pasted"" right from another source. Bossidy's incessant need to pat himself on the back for his work at AlliedSignal becomes irritating before the close of the first chapter.The writing itself is terrible by both authors, especially Bossidy; unfortunately, his contributions comprise the bulk of text. Charan's portions of the text, while more readable and useful than Bossidy's, are quite poor given his more academic-oriented career.Avoid this book like the plague. It is NOT worth your time. Essentially no information can be gleaned from this work that hasn't been already been discussed to death."
1,Terrible Book,"I was so looking forward to reading this book after having the privilege of hearing Larry Bossidy speak. However, the book was a HUGE disappointment to me, so much so that I shelved it after 80 pages. It was terribly written by both contributing authors. Frankly, there was no need to write this book at all. The premise was so simplistic that I gained no more knowledge about execution in business than I had before reading it. Having just earned my MBA, I had been exposed to so many great business books during the course of my studies. I am glad that this book never showed up on any of my reading lists.Take my advice and don't bother buying this book, if you have an ounce of intelligence, you will come away saying ""why did I waste my time with reading this""."
4,Excellent ....must have.,"We all know the importance of getting things done. But there is a thin (and sometimes not clear) line between micro management and executing critical things. The book addresses many such issues and has given a clear road map of ""execution"".The case-study of EDS is also very interesting and relevant to lot of organizations.After reading the book, you can figure out the difference between a good company and a great company....and no guess it is leader's ability to execute."
2,Not very good,"I stopped reading this about half way through. If you have any common sense and reasonable people skills, you don't need to read this to be able to ""get things done."""
2,NON-EXECUTION,"I bought this book because some managers with whom I was working were reading it - their CEO had pushed it at them. I was very disappointed. Great title but... there didn't seem to be anything about the discipline of doing anything in it. I did force myself to read it from cover-to-cover, underlined and made notes in the margins, and at the end flipped back through it to see if somehow I'd missed somehting. Lots of verbal arm-waving and self-evident maxims for anyone who is halfway thinking. Execution? No. Might be good fodder for a CEO who is struggling with putting together a good speech or rallying cry to the troops. And... I'll give the author credit for at least tackling a topic that IS important. This is a book that I would have wanted to be very good."
4,Business case studies,"Execution is interesting in the context of numerous case studies that the authors have covered, but lacks a real, predictive model. There is some solid advice in the book, and a few lessons to be learned from the discussed examples, but many of the recommendations are either tautological, or simply motherhood and pie. At times, the authors contradict their own recommendations in the case studies and propose circular definitions that lead nowhere fast. This is not to say that this is a poor book, it's well written and offers some great insights - I just wouldn't place it at the top of my reading list."
5,Take your leadership skills to the next level....,"Execution, The Discipline of Getting Things Done, will help you think and manage like a winner! The book is exactly what one would expect from a former GD Exec (Bossidy) an advisor to Blue Chip CEO's (Ram). The essence of the book is to show how to link three of the most important parts of an organization, People, Strategy and Operations, to create a competitive, agile, team that produces results. The book ties in many themes that were in Jack Welch's Winning. The lessons are taught in the context of a manufacturing business, which doesn't really relate to my field but it was very easy to draw the parallels.I have to admit that when I started reading the book I almost put it back on the shelf because it didn't quite engage me. My one complaint is that some of the chapters seemed long making the material difficult to absorb at times. Overall, I am glad I kept reading because I got some great insight into the ways of successful companies and leaders."
3,Execution Is One Half Of A Good Book,Execution is basically two books: The Building Blocks of Execution and The Processes of Execution.The Building Blocks were intriguing. Stimulated a lot of discussion. One hundred forty-or-so pages worth reading. 4 stars.The Processes filled the usual 265 page contract. Painful. 2 stars.Business readers will save time and (possibly) buy more books when publishers stop paying by the pound.
3,Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done,Interesting perspective on corporate business. Unique complilation with text and the author's quotes.
1,Old management style,"Great 1950's style management approach, but who cares about going back to the 1950's. A poor example of caring about others."
2,Good idea but flawed EXECUTION,"This book really fills a gap.However, the authors attention to detail (e.g. inventory turns of Dell compared to compeditors) or hip-fire conclusions (355% return on equity is great - ok. we forgot to check the debt to equity ratio) diminishes its value much.Try again and bring us a updated, carefully edited and checked version of a text much needed.Still worth a read for its overall idea if you are versed enough in finance etc. to see the parts that are just no proof for the statements made by the authors.rs"
1,terrible,"if you lack total common sense about1. Leading teams2. Why it's important to understand the low-level details about how your teams are performing their tasks3. Defining near, mid, and long-term plans for your productthen you will learn a lot from this book. this is just management 101. i was expecting to learn some fairly esoteric methods for execution but for all intents and purposes learned nothing. take one of your direct reports to lunch and talk business....you'll get more out of that lunch than you did spending $20 bucks on this book and reading it"
5,Absolutely brilliant. Highly recommended.,"Absolutely brilliant. Getting things done is much harder than saying it. Leaders can only ""execute"" by managing three essential elements and linking them together - people, strategy, and operations. Without strong infrastructure and connectivity of these three elements organizations fail to do what they say they will. In other words, they fail to execute. Highly recommended."
3,Inspiring,"Inspiring book. I also loved 'Running with the Rhinos"" most recently published and fantastic insight on leadershipRunning with the Rhinos: Courageous Leadership for a Complex World"
2,This one is written for a Fortune 500 CEO.... Only!,"I love to read business leadership books like these. I'm not a CEO, rather a middle manager. Usually, I can find something valuable to a person in my position when I read books like Execution. This book was a big exception! The ideas in this book are fuzzy, big picture type recommendations. I cannot say that I got anything really from reading this book. If you're like me, in a leadership position much closer to the front lines, you'll get more execution information from the book ""Getting Things Done"", by David Allen. I put that stuff to use right away and haven't stopped."
2,Not sure,"I have not had the time to read this book as of yet, it was recommended to us in our class while we were training."
4,Tough to teach execution but there are some real pearls,"I've read this book now twice and I come back to the real value of designing your leadership skills to make ""executing"" easier. Not that there are many original ideas embedded in the pages but there is some useful ideas about priorities and advice about focus. I specifically enjoyed the author's view of really rewarding the individuals that get the right things done. Too many times we overlook this simple advice and revert to the mediocre. In summary, there aren't any true monumental or shocking thoughts in the pages but it's a nice refesher to help you remember one of your most important roles as a leader.. to execute upon plans."
2,Disappointing,"I listened to the unabridged version from Audible and got through half of it. Good subject, but disappointing.From a presentation perspective, apparently all the authors narrated it and the different accents did not help to communicate the message.Beyond the cosmetics, I felt the authors focused solely on an executive audience. As a member of corporate middle management, I found there was little ""meat"" I could take away for self-improvement. I have found better treatment of this subject from material from Peters and Blanchard some ten-plus years ago."
3,Some people are beyond help,"I bought this book five years ago, but never took it out of the plastic wrap. How ironic is that?"
3,"Understand the point, but the book is a bit dry...","Have a lot of respect for both Larry Bossidy and Ramcharan, and know of their achieements. The importance of Execution is the exact other half component of a business (the first half is to bring the vision/idea). Without Execution, vision or idea has no value and Execution can only follow a vision or idea.Book has some good tips, and good to use lessons, and some examples as well; it is not that I did not get enough value out of this book, but unable to figure out why the book has so many pages for delivering the base concept alone. I wish the book had more specific guideliens, tool tips to improvise on some one why may lack focus on execution."
1,Exe-what?,Execution? How about duplication! This book builds itself as a discipline for getting things done. The leader's seven essential building blocks don't offer anything new or insightful. The idea that you and your organization will be able to better execute because of this book is a laugh.Bravo to the marketing genius that put this together!
2,The authors didn't execute.,"Funny that a book about execution doesn't get it accomplish. The authors have a lot of experience and I am sure are good at leading and executing. However, the book does not get to the point. The authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas."
2,"Writing could have been ""Executed"" a bit better","I had a very hard time getting through this book. I love to read books about business (or any other books for that matter) and enjoy learning different points of view on very abstract subjects; however, this book didn't have a lot to offer as a way to keep me interested. The authors speak as if they are all-knowing and imply that if you disagree with their point of view then you are destined to fail.Perhaps the problem is that I am reading the book nearly 3 years after it has been published. However, if that is the case then it is hard to imagine that this is going to be one of the great business books. If it is out-of-date just 3 years after it is published, how will it fare in 25 years?I am not sure if I would recommend this book to others. It seems that a business person would be better of actually using their time on actual execution instead of reading about how others aren't doing it."
2,Disappointed with focus on academic excercises,"This book reads like something a highly-paid consultant would put together for an undergrad business course. Bossidy's rich business experience and wisdom has been all but lost here in favor of cookie-cutter, common sense management credos espoused by co-author Ram Charan. Moreover, the ""tag-team"" writing style can be irritating and, frankly, often rather drab.As much as I like Larry Bossidy and owning HON stock, he should probably consider exiting the book-writing business."
2,Standard business consulting verbiage,"I was hoping that this was a down-to-earth book with interesting and useful ideas like Built to Last or No Excuses Management. Alas, it's just a standard, boring, fluffy business book filled with many more words than are called for. It might be worth reading if you're stuck on an airplane with it."
4,"Clear, to the point, relevant examples","This was a great book on how to integrate the mentality of how to execute into the culture of an organization. It makes it very easy to compare your organization to what is ideal, see how you can change and highlight areas of improvement. Over all a great buy. It could have had more on developing leaders within a corporate setting but for critiquing an organization and learning what it takes to get to the next level it was conprehensive."
5,The Missing Link,Ram and Larry have done a wonderful job of clearly laying out what is needed to succeed in todays turbulent business world. Most authors like to sensationalize simple issues and write about things that would seem sexy enough to sell.'Execution' points out with a number of examples the fundamental errors senior management often makes and steps to correct them. This is a good read for people at all levels in the organization.Overall it is a well written book with simple ideas and techniques powerful enough to bring out the best in your organization.
2,Not essential business literature,"The authors bring up to the table a new perspective on the very critical issue of ""Execution"" in business. They also went one step further, developing a framework to improve the ""art"" of getting things done. The authors deserve credit for that. However, the book has no academic rigor and issues are discussed superficially. The constant references to GE and Jack Welch are tiring and often, the business cases state the obvious. Read it only if you have some spare hours and you want to know about the latest MBA-like framework."
4,Well Done,"This book deservedly spent many, many weeks on the business nest seller lists because it addressed a neglected topic: how to make sure that brilliant strategies ""hit the ground"" and produce results.As an HR practitioner, there are many, many needed messages here. Among them:1. Performance appraisals need to be honest and direct.2. Leaders must be measured on thier personal commitment to the organization's strategic success.3. Recruiting must be informed with a bias for ""doers"" as opposed to theorectical people.4. ""Retnetion risk"" is a wonderful saying; successful organizations don't wait long to deal with nonperformers.Great book - it complements well so much of what's been written about the brilliance of strategy creation."
3,"Good principles, bad main example.","Overall, I liked the audiobook. It emphasizes several useful concepts: the value of evaluating performance, how to evaluate it, how to deal with non-performers, recognizing the doers, and so on. Listening to Bossidy is like having a coaching session.The main flaw of the book was the choice of Dick Brown of EDS as an example of somebody who knows how to execute. He was removed from the CEO position in 2003 after it was discovered he had made some megadeals that cost EDS millions of dollars. When it was made public, it produced exactly what the authors describe as the result of poor execution: stock value that falls immediately, investor loss of trust, and low morale for the employees.The authors should have provided more examples. In the end, they provided three examples of troubled companies, and not a single success case. The principles are useful, though, even without a good case. That's the reason the book gets three stars."
3,"Execution for Beginners, ...not for Masters.","The book really lays down the fundamental process for effective execution. Of course, as in reading any business books, the rules of the game cannot be fixed, and readers must be able to select, adapt, and improvise.One key principle preached in this book is about ""people"" process - putting the right people to the right job. Readers must note that, after the failed M&A; attempt between Honeywell and one GE's business, Honeywell CEO was pinpointed, and some said that he was not the right man for the job. Larry himself did not give any lesson learned from this case in the book at all.Lastly, managing ""people"" process appears too simple and straightforward by this book. It does not mention the essential fact that human mind is complex. And, as a CEO, you need to find ways to inspire and win employee's trust & belief, before you can move them into actions & executions."
1,Execution,"Nothing really groundbreaking here. Not surprising coming from Bossidy who did not ""Execute"" well at Honeywell either."
4,Execute to win,"In sales we teach that you have to be able to close a sale or you are not a salesman.In business you have to execute to win. Execution is to business leaders/managers what closing is to the saleman. If you don't execute, you have nothing. It's as simple as that."
4,A must to read for every manager,"Larry and Ram talk about their experiences with managing big companies. However, their advice is not only useful to CEOs but generally makes sense for everybody: Be honest about your goals, ambitions, and resources and follow up with your people. A disciplined way of working is both efficient and effective. Stress is minimized and success is assured. Too bad that most people do not follow these simple rules and therefore spread a lot of grief, turmoil, and stress."
4,Great Information on getting things done,The only caution I give the reader is that this book is geared toward the upper management (CEO) level. Pieces of this can be used an any and every level but the majority of this book is not applicable to all levels of management.This book opened my eyes to things from the perspective of the highest offices of an organization. It also let me know that most of my bosses have not been very good leaders. I already knew this but this book pointed out their faults in great detail.
1,What I learn from this book...,What I learn from this book: NEVER buy books based on the book title and bestselling list.
3,"Wait, I will write the review next week...",As evidenced by yet another manifestation of my procrastination the book does not work!
1,You are so inconsiderate,"When I first opened this book, I thought, ""This reminders me of somebody"". I pondered over it for a moment then I remembered my old companion, Carl K. Karlson. He was a bright lad, very fun and never put a foot wrong in his life. Then he was executed for failiure to return a library book. This book really disappoints me, as I thought you were more sensitve than this.I did enjoy the bit with the giant monkeys though, but the flying whales were over the top.Best wishes,Nick HallePresident of the Wrongly Executed Club"
4,Best book on strategic formulation and execution,This is a classic in the field of corporate strategy formulation and execution. I bought it for all our managers and best customers. I often refer to it before strategy and quarterly reviews. A must have !
4,"Nothing New, But Solid Information","The book asserts that execution is a discipline that is integral to a successful strategy. Execution is the business leaders' responsibility to make it part of the corporate culture. The book contains details of both successful and unsuccessful executions at corporations such as Dell, Johnson & Johnson, and Xerox. The examples support not only their how-to method for bringing execution to the forefront but also the need for it.At first glimpse execution is a duh topic, we know you need execution to get something done, but this book sums up that topic and illustrates concrete methods to improve your teams execution. This is a solid book with great information written by industry leaders. The authors don't bring anything new or ground breaking to light in Execution. With that said, new isn't always better. Old tested ways can be better than a new theoretical idea. It's good to get a reminder of solid time test concepts."
3,Get it done!,"Execution goes through a process of getting the job complete. The book can be a slow read and I did enjoy the audio more. Brett Vanderwater, MBA, CIA, CMA, CTP"
1,Execution: The Larry Bossidy Brag Sessions,"I read this a while back and I must say, if you like to read the ramblings and musings of a narcissist, this one's for you."
1,This book is a load of...,"I try to be very fair to business books, but I didn't even finish reading this one because it was so elementary and ridiculous. I almost vomited after reading the words ""execute"" and ""execution"" a hundred times in the first chapter.This is one of many books written by formerly successful business people who feel the need (for posterity and/or outright arrogance) to take a five-page concept and spread it out over a few hundred pages.If you can master this simple principle, you don't need to read this book: Once you have a great plan or idea, you need to implement it effectively. To not effectively implement your great plan or idea, is a waste of a good plan or idea.That's it folks. The rest of this book is double-talk and business ""war stories"". The rest of the book is so pointless, you'd be better off spending the time with your family, or reading a different book."
2,Obvious explained,"A wiseman said ""Vision without Action is Hallucination"". Truly, many brilliant strategies have failed on the altar of Execution. One must master the skills of Execution before one can Strategize.When I first read this book long back, I was disappointed that most of the recommendations were ""obvious"".. but now , a sadder and wiser man, I realise that Execution is easier ""said"" than ""done""Venkat"
4,Great first album Here,"I bought this album without knowing what I was getting. I was totally surprised. The song donde estan? alone is worth the album. I t is a great dance song along with a donde? another great hit by the duo. The girl has agreat voice and the songs are great, half ballads half dance."
4,Deleted intro,"Although I haven't had a chance to watch the entire dvd, there was one part of it that was omitted from the original vhs. There is a 3-5 minute intro of Jon Anderson leaving his dressing room and walking out intro the crowd, whilst he's talking to the camera. I love it! You can see the look of genuine surprise of the incoming audience as he meets, greets and shakes their hands. More evidence that Jon Anderson was and is a class act. Why the dvd version had to omit this is beyond me(I guess I'll still hold on to my vhs until I get it converted to---well, dvd)."
5,"Snuggly, cuddle up book",This is the perfect book to read with cocoa by a fire or in a cozy window seat during a snowfall. The stories are so heartwarming and personal..A perfect holiday/winter book.
5,Great Sermon Illustrations!!,"As a pastor of a church, I am always looking for interesting stories to use in my sermons to which the average person can relate, but are sophisticated enough to challenge people. The Christmas Eve Sermon is especially an important opportunity to touch people, bringing the message of hope and peace in a fresh way.This past year, a week before Christmas, I found Steve Burt's book and started reading it immediately. I was touched by the warmth and humanity I found in each of the stories, and was able to use several of them in the Christmas season in sermons.I recommend it highly for a variety of uses...sermons, personal inspirtational reading, use with families."
3,SENTIMENTAL STORIES OF CHRISTMAS,"Your hearts will be touched from this collection of charming and delightful Christmas stories by the Christmas Story Pastor. The experience of Christmas is varied from person to person as they (animals too) share their tales. For example, did you know that elephants were present at the manger scene? How do soldiers who are sworn to kill one another celebrate the birth of the Christ Child? Where did the mysterious frozen turkey and ""blanket"" come from at the annual Christmas pageant?These and other questions will keep you guessing and smiling as you go down memory lane in experiencing Christmases long gone. Share these tales with family, friends and congregations as you are moved in experiencing the true meaning of Christmas."
4,good-natured and heartfelt,"Steve Burt, a clergyman from Connecticut, here serves up a collection of the Christmas stories which he has produced annually for a number of years. Set mostly in New England, but ranging as far as Europe in WWI, they depict small acts of faith and simple human kindness which give the commonplace an aspect of the miraculous. They range from genuinely moving to endearingly hokey, but are all so good-natured and heartfelt that it's impossible not to be touched by them. The book will particularly appeal to churchgoers and seem like they'd be ideal for reading aloud at Christmas services, but they are universal enough that anyone can enjoy them.GRADE : B-"
5,Warms the Heart,"Whether it is winter or summer, a Christmas Dozen is a treat to read in any season. Pastor Steve offers a collection of delightful Christmas stories that warm your heart and renew your sense of faith, hope and love in the world. Wonderful to include in Children's sermons or sermon illustrations."
3,Not as expected,"Although it's still a cool game in other ways, it's not what you would expect of a ""burnout"" game. You're running around alone in the city and of course there are other vehicles on the road but they are not after you. You're just chasing time or unlocking hidden things... It's not what I like most bout burnout, which is the racing and beating up other cars that are trying to beat you too."
5,Awesome game by Criterion.,I love the graphics. The crashes are awesome. The events are short but are a lot of fun. I spend most of my time on my PS3 playing Burnout Paradise. Only $20. I think you should buy it if you don't have it already.
5,Great Game!,"Excellent game! Until this game, the best Burnout was Burnout Revenge. This by far better than all burnout games. 5 stars!"
4,"Great game for single player and online, but sadly no split screen","This game is the best auto racing game on the PS3, but would be even better if it had split screen. Its replay value is just so much worse than it should be because of this. The story mode gets old fast, and you have to be creative to make the online mode fun, but it is still a good game. I highly recommend this game, especially if you like online racing."
4,It's Fun,"I enjoy playing this game, but its easy for me do set down and do something else (5 stars - i'd have a hard time putting the controller down)."
1,No crash mode.,This game was known for crash mode and the drunken fun that ensued while playing it. I will save everyone the time and money and say dont buy it. Burnout without crash mode is like pizza without cheese...it just doesnt work.
2,Nothing New Here!,"First of all I would like to say the Burnout series is amazing. With that being said Burnout Paradise is completely unoriginal and very much a GTA clone. I'm sorry but the ""open"" map idea has been done by every genre on every system. That doesn't make a game Next Gen. The graphics are great the controls are just as good. But the completely un-orginal idea to make this a GTA clone makes me laugh. you blew it burnout!"
2,???,"at first i enjoyed the game i only got to the first part though because after a while it stopped working i am not sure it its the game or the ps3 but the car wont turn. i play other games perfectly fine so i doubt its my ps3, my friends and i tried to fix it maybe i pressed something but nothing the car wont turn it just goes straight so i obviously stopped playing it and cant tell if the game was any good"
2,No split screen multiplayer?,"My PS3 has two controllers. All of the other burnout games feature split screen multiplayer where I can play with my friends in my living room. So please, somebody explain to me why they would make it so Burnout Paradise has NO split screen multiplayer?Seriously. How is a two player mode on the same machine not a no brainer? Come on."
3,"Good game, pretty repetive","This game is fun for the first few hours of the game but it is so repetitive that you get bored pretty quick. The graphics are the best I've EVER seen in a racing game. This game is gorgeous. The only complaints i have is the repetitiveness and the lack of licensed cars. The cars are not fun to drive because you can't take pride in the car you are driving. With a generic looking and unnamed car, it takes some of the fun out. Over all i would buy this game again because it is sooo much fun to race your friends online."
2,Great game only if you play alone. NO local multiplayer,"I agree with all the reviews here about the great graphics and depth of the game, so I won't go into that. However, my favorite part of burnout was playing with friends. There is NO split-screen multiplayer with burnout paradise. You need more than one PS3 to play with multiple players via the internet. This really ruins the game for me because it makes burnout paradise solely a game for those who play alone (and none of the reviews at the game websites mentioned this). Unfortunately for me, I got this game hoping to play with friends. There is no crash mode either, which was pretty fun."
4,Cheesy Junker Fun,"Like another reviewer said this is very much like an arcade racing game: you have the fast paced music, the cheesy commentator, the user friendly easy controls, repair shops to customize your car, junk yards to get new cars. Makes the driving/racing experience fun. One thing I also like about this game is that you decide when and where you want to race you just aren't forced into race after race you can cruise around if you want to or get a new car or customize it then pick which race you want to do. It's like a sandbox car racing game. I play this game in between my other games for a change of pace. Don't expect a Gran Turismo 5 though this actually has the element of cheesy fun injected into it."
4,burn out fun,The game arrived and was in good shape. It took a while to get here but overall was a very good experience.
5,Awesome!,"Overall, the best racer on next gen systems. It's so much fun and has a little bit of everything to please any racing gamer."
4,Not perfect,"I'm a big fan of the Burnout Series, and like the others I find myself really frustrated at some of the decisions the developers made. They make no sense and some just tiny changes would make the game so very much better.However it is hard to focus on the shortcomings when you're having this much fun. I literally catch myself laughing out loud and swerving around in my chair. Really can't ask for more than that.You have to spend extra real life dollars to get certain cars though, and I can't give 5 stars to a game with so few scruples."
5,An Arcade Racer with speed to spare,This game plays fast... really fast. The RoadRage races remind me of the old Daytona USA arcade races. It's one of the easiest racers to ease into and is not for the perfectionist racer.The game plays faster than any Need For Speed game ever made. And the downloadable content is almost endless. MUST OWN for pick-up and play racing lovers. Any price < $30 is a STEAL for the amount and quality of game!
2,Only 2 Stars for NOT having OFFLINE 2 player mode.,"I bought a second controller, only to eventually realize that this latest edition of Burnout did not have an offline 2 player mode. I don't think it even has the fun crash mode where you rack up how expensive the crash was (maybe you have to unlock it... or possibly worse and pay for the additional layer of gameplay). I remember playing Burnout years ago when a friend had it, and it seems it was much better (feature-wise) then. The game looks awesome, but I gave up on it and purchased Split/Second... which I'm MUCH happier with."
4,Great game,"Well, let me just say that the only other burnout I played was Takedown. This game--Burnout Paradise--is incredible. You can instantly go online while playing and have an open and free world to explore.Pros-Freedom (to drive anywhere, use any routes ect)-Online play is a blast-Wrecks looks great-Good car selectionCons-No split screen multiplayer-Car-specific events are irritatingI recommend this game even if you don't normally like racers. Its so free, open, and easy accesable to anyone to just enjoy. Probably a better choice than the Midnight Club LA game coming soon (just a guess)."
2,Very unreal...,What I don't liked about the game was that you're in an unreal city. I like Gran Turismo cause you compete on real locations. The other thing I didn't like is that you've to use many unrealistic things like the turbo function in order to win and not your real skill as a pilot.
1,Aargh... Insipid and Bore.,"I'm new to VideoGaming. And, this is the first game I played on PS3. Was very excited about it until I played for 10 minutes. There is no objective in the game as such. You just have to drive around in the city. I really got DIZZY after few more minutes, due to poor high-speed simulation. Will never play again."
1,Game for a 5 year-old,"This game has nothing to do with a racing game! Not realistic what so ever, not even the cars actually exist!A 5 year-old may have fun pressing on the gas and seeing himself wreck his car 100 times with no consequences and pushing other cars off the road in order to win a """"""race""""""... But if I buy a racing game I expect to at least see a speedometer and have a decent sense of reality!Rediculous!!!"
3,"I dont like this game, is better the olders Bournout","I like Bournout is a different car game, very exciting but this is a great deception, because is for only one player, and a lot of functionality are change, for example Bournout 3 has a specific prove that you jump in a ramp a you need to make the most terrific vial chaos, but this version don't have.Another thing is that don't have GPS, and is very very necessary in the middle of the game."
5,This game series never disappoint,Im still playing it and Im having so much fun plus the DLC content is cool. Give it a try you wont be disappointed the only cons i found is that you have to look at the map every minute so you dont get lost on the big Paradise city because the cars are so fast that you could miss streets without notice it but overall its a nice clasic =)
2,can't play with your friends,"sorry, but they took out the best parts of burnout.1. you CAN'T play with your friends at home (no split-screen multiplayer).2. no road-rage online.really sucked to find that out after getting the game..outherwise it's cool but without those 2, i'd skip it."
2,Motorcycle doing wheelie can't flip backwards,"Try GRID racing game which I think is better.Way, way too many screen options before I could just start racing is very very frustrating.Only 1 car and 1 motorcycle, the rest have to be bought online (stop nickel and dime me).I didn't grow up with muscle cars, mostly rice burner cars.Awesome crash scenes."
3,not that great,"This game is fun but it does not have many choices. For example, There is no customizetion at all. There are only 75 cars and you get them very quickly. So it makes the game short. I am glad that they made it $20 because it is not worth it. Crashing is very easy, the Ai is stupid, they run into cars all the time which you do have to dodge. I didn't even beat and I quit playing because of bordom. Trust me this will get boring! In the end this could of been a fun game but it isn't. I hope this helped you and you should look for a different game like midnight club 4 or gran turismo. Thanks."
4,Great game if you like to drive around for hours,"A great way to kill some time. You can drive through 'Paradise City' for hours, without getting bored. This is definitely one of my favorite 'car raceing game'. And the soundtrack is very good, too !"
1,No local multiplayer!,"This is the worst Burnout to date. I played Burnout Revenge for hours on end with my wife, and I was excited to buy my first title for the PS3. I was greatly dissapointed! Not only could I not play against my wife or friends, I had to drive around like an idiot to look for races.No crash mode, no local multiplayer, and on top of that, the game dropped down to $19.99 2 weeks after I bought it.I also downloaded the ""Multiplayer"" expansion so I can play local multiplayer, only to find out that one player plays first in a time trial, then player 2 does the same trial. Very ridiculous. Shame on you Criterion for making a crappy game and then a fake local multiplayer mode. Please send me the $40 total that I spent on your boring software."
1,iLok is rubbish!!,"I have never been able to get this worthless thing to work. $300 down the tubes! total WASTE!! RUBBISH CRAP!!! The worst part is the iLOK thing (worst idea ever!!) totally broke and now they want $50 bucks for a new one? I mean, it takes up an entire USB port so that it can run a license for one [crappy] program. As you can probably tell, I am not happy. Boycott!! DONT BUY!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO"
1,Nothing like a book full of bitter contempt to start your morning!,"Bloom not only can't appreciate who King is but resents King for what he isn't; Shakespeare, Saul Bellow, DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon, or Philip Roth. That is the old relic's safe, little comfort zone.Howard Bloom, the crumudgen cliche, a carictacure of the out-of-touch literary snob has a bone to pick with King and ironicaly isn't capable of articulating what exactly is wrong with King's work.Shame on you King for your success, your genres of choice, your style, for being prolific, and most of all being honored by the National Book Foundation. Shame on you, for you have ""dumbed down"" the American readers. But there is a single purpose to King's work, according to Bloom, to keep the publishing world afloat. Ahhh, the world through the eyes of a bitter old man.$45? You've got to be kidding."
1,Bloom Is Off the Rose,"If literacy is dead, Bloom killed it. Bloom never understood the simple fact that since the Vulgate edition of the Bible, it has been the popular culture that animates literature; and it is the popular genres--mystery, fantasy, horror, science fiction, and so on that energize it. Bloom wants all literature to be the mundane, vapid tomes of the academy. This is the kind of pseudo-intellectual claptrap that turns off even the most disciplined of young minds to literary pursuits. If Bloom doesn't get why King is a master storyteller, or why J. K. Rowling has everybody reading about Harry Potter, he's hopeless. Put him out to pasture. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,wolf mouse pad,"I was/am disappointed with my mouse pad. The coloring is off. The wolf looks too green (why is it green?) and the background was not dark enough. I went over the black background with a black magic marker and onto some of the dark areas on the wolf itself. It made it look much better, but I wouldn't recommend it. I feel bad saying that....Anyway, it's only a mouse pad, could be worse : ) It came very quickly though. That was nice."
4,Can't quite make up his mind,"The better part of this book is a series of dated quotations from the former VP. This would be the ""Fair, Unbiased"" part. A great deal more of the book is acerbic commentary, and quotes from Quayle's enemies. While the commentary is rooted in fact, the obvious loathing of the book's central topic takes away from the rest of the book, which is valuable reference in answering anyone who asserts that Dan Quayle was leadership material. The book is appreicably brief, and there is gobs on information here nonetheless."
4,Great Reel,"I bought these reels to fish for halibut off the beach with a couple of surf caster rods. It isn't the reels fault that I haven't caught any fish yet. I need to put more time into fishing and quit working so much. I am sure the reel will perform great. I will say that I am a bait cast reel user mostly, but these little reels and send an 8 oz weight out quite a ways."
1,It is a Joke!,"This is a joke! I buy this because I was curious and tried few times in my house with my wife, just to see if there was any diferent reaction or comments from her. She never even noticed that I have something. After all I told her the story and we have some fun talking about it. It was an expencive joke, cost me about $50... LOL"
3,Irwin confirms: Not cobalt!,"Irwin customer service confirms (reproducing their email to me):This set is actually not a Speedbor Max set; it is called a Turbomaxset. I checked with our engineer and the 318015 set is made out of M2equivalent high speed steel and does not contain cobalt. We have a callinto Amazon to get this information corrected on their website. Thankyou for bringing this to our attention.Thanks, Beth - Irwin Industrial Tools\Bernzomatic"
2,"Slow, cheap.","This is definitely Irwin's low end bit. I drilled some test holes in wood (older Douglas Fir which is pretty hard). Compared to old somewhat dull Dewalt bits, these were slower, got hotter faster, and were generally unpleasant to use. The 1/8"" bit broke after 6 holes."
5,Fast and Sharp,These guys really rip through stuff I also find it easier to pilot the hole freehand with these bits over the conventional ones that tend to walk around. Case is made to last and they have a couple of doubled sizes of the common small bits.
3,3 stars for now,"Got these today arrive on time and in perfect condition. BUT be advised these are like a brad point bit which makes me doubt the ability to work in metal, but time will tell if they will cut metal well, especially if it is more than 1/16"" thick, Will revise this after I have used them. But for wood they look great, easpeciallt for the $9 they cost after discounts and free shipping............"
5,Twila does it again!,"Twila Paris has a unique style of music that simply cannot be duplicated. Her voice is a treasure that gets you in the right mood for worship, and the lyrics of her music certainly are as well, earning her the title ""the modern day hymn writer."""
1,TERRIBLE disappointment,"I was so excited about ordering this CD because being a fan of Juanes, Bacilos, etc. I thought I had found another good artist, and all the demos of the songs were very catchy. Catchy is one thing, and if the messages were merely lacking in profundity I wouldn't have rated this CD so low. However, Rayito's lyrics are TERRIBLE. They are shallow and sexist, and whether or not they have a good rhythm I cringe to hear these songs. The image he portrays is of an immature, selfish, conceited womanizer. Anyone who has any respect for, well, respect, do yourself a favor and pass up this album. Get a hold of something good like Juanes or Bacilos, someone mature who doesn't try to pass off this trash as music on par with the great Latin singers.I am transferring ""Aqui huele a quemado"" to my iPod (it is catchy) and literally throwing the rest of the CD away.Moral of the story: always investigate music BEFORE you buy it. What a waste."
3,size misrepresented,"I like the watch but it is not a ""ladies"" watch--it is man-sized. I ended up giving it to my husband."
4,Great canyon history,"Not only does this book have a mileage guide to the canyon, but it contains interesting history of the places and people who lived in the canyon. It also has lots of photos of the rock art and ruins of a prehistoric culture known as the Fremont."
3,Visual Dissapointment,"Based on the cover of the book, and being a lover of all things about the Old South, I was anticipating a beautifully illustrated book in the tradition of Deborah Turbeville's ""Newport Remembered"" or ""Versailles--Absolutism and Harmony"" by Claire Constans and Jean Mounicq. I found a few interesting photos scattered through the book, but thought it was cast in a dreary light for the most part, and just plain awful in others. NOT a pretty cocktail-table book, if that's what you're looking for. Must admit, though, it is very informative."
4,Does it's job,Does its job... except that its sockets are too close together. I only managed to fit five plugs into its six jacks... and I had to force fit one of them!
5,This guy's got talent and then some!,"Not since Perry Como, Andy Williams, or even Slim Whitman have I heard such a heartwarming rendition of Christmas favorites. Mr. Hesh is obviously a musical genius so I wonder why there aren't more releases of his music available. This CD rates right up there with ""Zippy and the Zappers and Their Brand New Bag""."
4,BIRKENSTOCK,birkenstock's are great shoes the only problem i had with this shoe is that it runs small. most birk's run to the larger side.
3,Narrow sandal,"Received this sandal last week, I haven't wear it out yet, but when i try it on, i don't think it's a comfortable sandal. Before I bought this I already know this is narrow size sandal, and I have regular feet, so i think it should be fine for me, but it's not. If you want to buy this sandal, make sure you have ""NARROW feet"". It's not a comfortable sandal..."
3,Half of What You Need,"Unfortunately, this is the only study guide for the GRE Literature Test that I know of (the other is just a collection of practice tests). While I felt it helped me prepare for the GRE, I think it needs updated, especially the literary theory. There were numerous questions about literary critics and their books not mentioned even in passing in this book. Many of the older writers are barely on the test, like Chaucer. Urging students to review their Norton is a helpful suggestion and the practice test along with the one supplied by the GRE is also some help in getting ready. Hopefully this book will be updated soon or the test will be discontinued, good luck!!"
4,I enjoy these videos,This DVD is very entertaining. I really enjoy it. I watch it (and love the music of course) many times.
4,Above Average,"A few great songs here. The lead singer, Gwen, could easily be a solo gig and compete with the leading female big names."
4,"Fantastic, but COMPLETE Collection is NEEDED!!","Great collection of NO DOUBT videos!However, we should have COMPLETE collection of ALL No Doubt videos!! Maybe even add Gwen's solo videos as bonus DVD(s)!Please - ENOUGH with incomplete music video releases of singers & bands!COMPLETE music video releases!Since the fallen, lower-than-pond-scum MTV & VH1 channels hardly play music videos, it's about time the copyright holders of the videos release only COMPLETE collections in CHRONOLOGICAL order - PLEASE!!!!That's the ONLY reason I gave this DVD collection 4 stars instead of 5. It's MISSING videos!Maybe also add a few best live music clips, too."
5,Must have DVD,I Myself have not yet bought this item but on the weekend i will but i have the cd version and i like it alot and ive been to their website and this should even be better than the cd version so i give it 5 stars and encourage you to buy it.
2,Could be much better!,Great videos of course but the audio lacks big time. Each one is recorded with original audio instead of a standard and there's no audio options available like 5.1 or DTS. A bummer!
1,UGLY LAMP!!,"This lamp is huge and ugly! I will never buy a Hunter lamp again (see my review on Hunter floor lamp). It is poor quality, difficult to assemble, and so big it seemed to take over the bedroom! Also, shade is not true color."
5,"Great Read, Interesting Biogaphy","William and Mary is a fascinating look into two of the most unique of British monarchs. The only joint sovereigns in British history, William and Mary reigned togther from 1689 to 1693, when Mary died and William ruled alone until 1702. Van de Kiste's clear writing style and interesting anecdotes make the history come alive, and a series of carefully selected plates enliven the text. Overall a very good read into what most historians simply gloss over- the feelings and aspects of daily life of the period."
1,Touhg Tape is alot better than Tought Tape 2,"I really loved the original ""Tough Tape"" with Tracie Long. So I was in a rush to go out and get Tough Tape 2. I agree that this tape is very choppy. The instructors go straight from one thing to another. In other Firm videos, you have one instructor throughout who preps you on what weight size you need and what position you should be in before startng another exercise. It is not here! This tape goes from one move to another with no pointers or explainations of the exercises. I was so disappointed. Save your money and buy the original ""Tough Tape"" instead."
4,"Not perfect, but still a great workout!","Tough Tape 2 is just what it says ... tough, at least for intermediate exercisers like myself!Although other reviewers have noted that this tape is choppy, I really didn't notice that ... I was too busy focusing on the workout itself. It is a tad bit fast paced for me, and I did end up hitting the pause button on a few occasions, but I believe that time and repetition with ""cure"" that. I do recommend having all of the necessary equipment near by!This is a well-rounded tape that sculpts all major muscle groups, as well as some you might not have even known you had. Wonderful for sculpting your body for swimsuit weather! (Used in conjunction with cardio tapes).To do this workout, you will need a Fanny Lifter (can be purchased at 1-800-THE-FIRM), 3 to 15 pound dumbells (heavier for advanced), and I believe you need a dowel as well (can substitute a broom or mop handle if you wish).Not recommended for someone who is brand new to exercise."
3,Perfect Fit,"I bought two of these. One works great,easy to use, secures phone in place. I'd give it 5 stars. The other won't hold the phone in place, so is useless. No stars for it."
5,Perfect and Easy!,"This item was easy to find, purchase and use. Saved us several dollars as well. A true win-win. Thanks."
4,Good,The front visors fit and work well. You can't roll the back windows down without water coming into the vehicle. It is not the vent visors fault. It's the way the vehicle is made. Over all the the vent visors work well and I would recommended to buy.
5,Great Man!! Great Music!!,"The reknowned Lawrence Welk was a great man with great music as illustrated in this A&E Biography.Lawrence,we all love and miss you!!"
4,How Do Movies Like This Go Unseen?,"Caught this movie at the Studio Movie Grill in Houston. Let me start by saying that the film is low budget, and there is no way around that. However, the story, tension, and dark humor shine through in this simplistic, Gaslight style tale reminscent of old Hollywood.The performances are as good as you'll see in a low-budget flick, particularly Jennifer O'Dell, who stands out in her role as the femme fatale and shows a true grasp of the material in everything she does. Do yourself a favor and check this out. You won't be dissapointed."
1,Poor Quality,Received in record time but the quality of the DVD was very poor. Would not recommend purchasing this product. Rent the movies instead.
2,A real Disappointment,"Each year around Mother's Day WB release a set of the great MGM musicals of the past. This year they have opted to only re release already released prints (I dont think you will find this ""Showboat""is the upgraded version at all). Why????? This is a real disappointment when there are still many great MGM musicals that have never been released on DVD. Yes I think we shall soon see ""Showboat""in all 3 versions and that will be great, but what about ""The Student Prince"", ""The Great Carouso"", ""Athena"", ""Give a Girl a Break""(with Fosse doing all that great dancing), ""Invitation to the Dance"" to name a few, that would have made a perfect set this year????"
5,great buy,I love musicals and this DVD was a great find. They are all lighthearted and fun to watch too. The cast and singing are fantastic.
2,Collection is great but....,Someone else mentioned this and I figured they might have fixed it but guess not. The movie selection is wonderful but disappointed that they come all stacked on top of each other. I got another four pack of a series I watch and they had least had two holder with one disc on each side so they were seperated. I would have paid a little more for better packaging. I will probably pull these out and put them in separate jewel cases. Why ruin a good movie. TCM please change the packaging.
4,Good,"The quality of the DVDs is good. I was expecting all four movies to be on two DVDs at most, so I was presently surprised the find each movie on a separate DVD. They have more music and singing in them than I remember, which can be a little too much for me. But they are broadway musicals so that's to be expected. If you keep that in mind and like this genre, you'll like these."
5,Great! :),"Got it quick, and its wonderful, loved the movies! Got it especially for the movie Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, as it was much cheaper to get it in this set than by itself :) and I got three more wonderful movies for less than the price of just one! Great product, only thing that bugs me is the fact they put all the cds on top of each other, but they're all ok and working really good, just make sure your careful removing them and putting it back. Good product, love it."
3,Great Product - Poor Packaging,"The reason I rated this product three stars is because of the packaging. The movies are great and the price can't be beat. My only complaint is that all 4 discs were on the same latch - one on top of the other. I have bought sets such as this, from other manufacturers and usually each disc is on a separate place. The way these are packaged could cause discs to be scratched. They are good copies why skimp on the packaging and possibly cause damage?? I will be hesitant to buy any other TCM compilation such as this for that reason."
4,Good ole Days!,"This DVD is wonderful if you like the Musicals of the mid 20th century. Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Betty Hutton and Jane Powell are names my mother used to rave about and I still love to watch. I have an old VHS of Seven Brides for Seven brothers and have worn it out.I bought this so my grandson could enjoy it with me and he loves the shows.The ONLY fault I have with this DVD is that the ""SOUND"" has to be almost all the way up to hear the ""talking"". Wonderfully remastered for color, it could have better audio."
2,Double Sided Discs,"I love musicals so much and was excited to get a nice group of them in one case, but I had no idea that they were reversible discs. You turn it on one side for one movie, and then you flip it over for another movie. I got the discs for Christmas and by April quite of few of them were scratched. I don't think these are very dependable at all. I treated them very carefully and I am not one to leave discs out and forgotten. I loved Annie get your gun and have seen it along with many of my kids, but I was only able to play it about 5 times before it had a weird ring around it and my dvd player has never done that to any other of my dvds. The packaging was great and these movies are pretty wonderful, but if you plan on watching them over and over this is not a combo DVD pack you want.TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Broadway Musicals (Show Boat / Annie Get Your Gun / Kiss Me Kate / Seven Brides for Seven Brothers)"
4,I like it!,My son is in the school plays and he needed to be able to play the DVD over and over again. It's a hit!
4,Some of the best musicals made,Back in the 50's & 60's Howard Keel and Katherine Grayson were paired very well in these classic musicals. All 4 were really nicely remastered. The colors really stand out
5,Daughter likes a lot,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
5,Love the classics,I got these for my mom she is so happy we were able to get them. I have to say they bring back great memories of Sunday mornings watching the old movies with my parents. Just great!
5,Best Musicals!,I got this bundle for my music classroom. These musicals are the best - especially Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. All of them are young child appropriate and lots of fun. I especially like that they are widescreen - I orginally had the tape of 7B and never realized how much I missed by not seeing it in widescreen. A definite recommendation!
4,Good,"Love the old classics!! Good quality, bought the same for my kids and they really got a kick out of these"
5,"I'm a 13 year ballet zumba instructor that can never get enough dancing, and 7 brides for 7 brothers is my favorite movie ever","There just hasn't been another movie since 7 brides for 7 brothers that matches this movie, the other 3 movies were just a complete bonus. Major idling and relaxation techniques occur while I'm inspired to teach my zumba classes.Thank you for the collection."
4,Fun,I had forgotten how fun these movies were to watch.The music and the acting like it was done back when people cared.Fun idea for movie night with your sweetie. Curl up and watch these heartwarming movies together.
2,Show Boat,"Color and clarity were far below expectations,especially for the Show Boat title.Gave it away to a local charity rather than retain it."
4,Good collection,This arrived and is actually 4 seperate disc instead of the 2 double sided as advertised. All 4 disc just stack on each other in the case. Good movies.
5,christmas gift,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandmother last year and she has no problems with any of the discs. Thanks!
5,LOVE,"I love these movies.... Well, Kiss Me Kate is okay, but I bought it solely for Show Boat and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The other two movies are just bonus to me."
3,3/4 titles worked,"I first purchased the set with Singin' in the Rain, Easter Parade, Meet Me in St. Louis, and the Easter Parade. That set came with two discs, none of which worked. This set has 4 DVDs, and are clearly marked (the former set looked like blank DVDs...I had to put the title on them with a Sharpie). However, only 3/4 titles work. Still a great deal for $10, but it would've been much better if all the DVDs worked!"
3,"Some good, some bad","The main reason I bought the 4 film dvd is for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and that was great! My granddaughter loves dancing! However, The opposite side, Annie Get Your Gun, skipped, stuttered and just didn't work.I suppose I could have sent it back but that's always such a hassle."
5,Excellent!,Great DVD and Great music! I like to have the true artists in my library and this one is super.
4,Dewey Does It Again,"Dewey Lamdin does another great job with this book. Some of his earlier books are better, but this book still has plenty to please the reader. As always you're left anxiously waiting for the next book."
4,THE CIRCUS,"Another Lewrie adventure This one starts slowly but (as usual) picks up once he is at sea. Two great battles separated by an adventure with a CIRCUS and its bareback rider. Well and accurately written, and a maturing hero. An exciting continuation of what is arguably the best of the Napoleanic sea stories."
4,80% OK but not one of his brst.,Quite a bit more bloody battle scenes than needed; less there and more on the Admiralty meeting at the ending climax climax.
5,A King's Trade,"I have enjoyed all the Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures previous to ""A King's Trade"" but this one is outstanding...looking forward to the ""his"" next adventure...hope I don't have to wait as long."
4,"""Mine arse on a band box!""","Would not go to work this morning without turning the last page and then required several hankies and some Visine to do so. 4 out of 5? Well, there must be something better and I'll be ready when I discover it. Lambdin again provides rollicking entertainment, and is a fount of archaic blasphemies and curses. This work is well worth the price and the exciting ride. Dosvadanya"
3,Afficionados Only,"Caveat: no previous experience with this series or its characters.The introduction of a ""circus ship"" was unique, as was its role in the final battle.As presented in this single volume, most of the characters were thin and the plot moved slowly.The extensive descriptions of non-naval activities (especially dining) were too detailed for my taste.This volume might be more appealing to those already familiar with the series and the author's style."
4,Outstanding live blues by the Iceman,"Download this gem, especially the instrumentals ""Deep Freeze"" and ""Backstroke"". Mu;stang Sally is not as exciting. The only real drawback is that they fade out most of the songs. Also avaliable at e-music.com. Get his hits first, but this is excellent stuff, and well-recorded for the late 60's. (a little hiss)"
1,Don't for sure but wasn't able to play this game.,Not for sure but think I purchased a game that can no longer be played. Tried to get online to play it but there wasn't no where to play it. So not for sure what the deal is.
1,Wow buy the game cant even play,"I baught this game on Aug 4th 2005. It installed fine, but i got a message saying i was a unsubscribed member. Funny i have a 30 day free trail. So, I call the customer support which gets a A+++ effort because they were open at 10pm my time, which is nice sense dark age of camelot has banker hours,lol. Well they informed me to email there support, strike one. This should be something they can deal with over the phone? Strike two, i send them an email, didnt get back to me, so i sent them another one. Being the idot that i am , i forgot to include my user name on second email, so they needed that info, and claimed never to get my first email( it wasnt returned to me) So strike three, 3 days owning the game still no play, taking it back to best buy and demanding customer credit....."
3,meh,It's ok. I like my linksys better.It's fine for people that sit at home and always connect to the same access point.
1,Doesn't work with Toshiba,"I'm disappointed. After reading the reviews, I purchased this adapter for my Toshiba laptop. I had previously purchased a WNDR3300 router with the expectation that this adapter would extend the range of reception. My installed G wireless in the Toshiba would reach only if I left the door open to my office which is in an outbuilding 75 feet away from the router, not an option in freezing weather. I was hoping the N adapter would do the trick so I could take full advantage of the extended range of N technology.THE ADAPTER DID NOT FIT MY TOSHIBA A205 S4797 laptop.There was no response to customer service on the weekend, so I sent Netgear an email. Netgear did not respond to my email either. Needless to say, I wasted my money. Don't buy this if you own a Toshiba laptop."
2,didnt fit,"i purchased this to upgrade my current wireless b system to n. nowhere in the specs or on the advertisement does it say that it uses cardbus and not expresscard. i received this product, tried to put it in, didnt fit, returned it. i know the picture is of a cardbus adapter, but i didnt think of it when i ordered it. i just looked at the technical specs. amazon should really update this page to state what it is instead of just notbook adapter."
4,happy NetGear buyer!!,"Very happy!! it's rock-solid in my older Dell laptop w/ XP. Previously used a Linksys wifi card that truly sucked--poor reception, frequently froze, constant rebooting, etc. Hoping the problem was just the wifi card, I rolled the dice and ordered this NetGear RangeMax.... and it worked GREAT from the moment it was installed. Seriously happy. It's ALWAYS online, grabbing signals from all the local hotspots, etc. Great low-cost fix for an aging laptop. NetGear rocks."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased the refurbished version of the WN511B card. The connection always starts at 270 Mbps, but it drops to 27 Mbps, then goes back up again. It tends to hover at 108 Mbps. I have a WNDR37A and the setting is on open without a passkey, but I have assigned the wireless access through mac addresses. The router is in direct eyesight of the adapter and only about 30 feet away. The card is currently at another laptop in the same room as the router (less than 2 feet away) it only gets 243 Mbps (max is 270 Mbps). This card is definitely sub par for a Netgear product. I purchased a Belkin N Wireless network card to replace it and the Belkin gets 270 Mbps from the very same position where the Netgear was 30 feet away. I might have gotten one of those bad eggs, but I wouldn't buy this again."
1,NOT an 802.11N card,"Bought this PCMCIA for my laptop thinking it was 802.11NIt is not, it only support B/D only.It is NOT supported under linux, which is what I use."
2,Great Price - Poor Performance,I have tried this on two laptops. Tried with two different WIFI routers of diffent brands with same results. The wireless G speed works pretty well. Wireless N starts out at 270 Mb (dual frequency) but drops to 1 Mb within 10 to 15 minutes. I am returning and purchasing a different brand.
1,WN511B No Joy,I still does not work. I will have to call in a professional. I am on chemo therapy so it will be awhile before something happpens. The OLD one works fine.Hardy
3,Fran Drescher - Cancer Shmancer,"Although not Shakespeare, the book was very informative & entertaining. For anyone, such as myself, who has been through this horrible ordeal, it is highly recommended reading. You may even learn a thing or two from the wisdom & experience of Francine Joy...Elk"
5,"Great, Quick Read","A very quick read and glimpse into Fran Drescher's experience with uterine cancer. I admired her ability to clearly depict some of the more poignant moments of her cancer battle and recovery.While some of the other reviews practically bash her, I doubt they've ever personally experienced a gynecological cancer. What drew me to this book was my own diagnosis of cervical cancer two years ago, around the exact same time as Fran's. She beautifully shared her feelings and emotions, and I had experienced virtually the same thing, so I felt better knowing someone else carried some of the anger that I did.Overall, a great book and worth the read!"
5,Very frank tell-all,"In this book, we learn most of what she wrote in her first book was actually a smokescreen. Her marriage wasn't that happy; the rape at gunpoint, dismissed in one chapter in the first book, becomes a pivotal plot point here, and there are no photos at all, unlike the first book which was full of snapshots. Drescher is shockingly frank about her symptoms, treatment, sex life, bodily functions, operations...and why not? We all experience many of these same things. Yet we're never told her lover's last name and there's no photos.It is a cautionary tale about being persistent with doctors when something is wrong with you and doing research. It's scary what doctors DON'T know. I cried all through the chapter about putting her dog Chester down."
5,Fabulously helpful!,This book was so fabulously helpful for my friend who is a breast cancer survivor and who was recently diagnosed with uterine cancer. This book helped her see that she wasn't alone and helped her in her journey. Thank you Fran!
4,Really helped me to understand my mother's pain,I thought this book was just wonderful. It was fun and light and yet it tackles a heavy subject. My mother went through a similar situation when I was around 7 and at its peak I was away at summer camp. Now nearly two decades later I was given the ability to understand some of the pain my mother had gone through while I was just a kid. And it also helped me to understnad myself as a woman and how my health isn't powered by the doctors but by me.
2,It was an okay read,"I like to hear and read about other peoples' experience w/ having cancer. I think there is a lot to learn from their stories, especially, to listen to your body and to know your body. No one know what's going on w/ your body like yourself.My sister is a breast cancer survivor. She was diagnosed at age 37. She had a 4 year old daughter at the time, is a professional in the healthcare field, was married to the most horrible man on earth who ended up leaving her and overcame a lot of issues w/ heartbreak and loss. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy reading Fran's story but I feel she was published because she is famous. My sister isn't famous but her story is so amazing and miraculous! I thank God everyday she is alive and healthy! She is the best sister ever!!!!"
3,A Serious Topic,"It is difficult to discuss a topic as serious as a misdiagnosed cancer in a humorous way. If you are looking for a laugh-a-minute, this is not the book for you. There are, however, several laugh out loud moments. Impossible to read and not feel empathy for Fran Drescher."
1,another self-serving fluf piece,"another self-serving fluf pieceextended Leno interview. nothing bad, just some funny stories which may or may not have happened to her mixed with some human interest. no mention made of why she moved out on her husband and moved into a beach-front mansion and moved her much younger 'personsal assistant' in. no mention of why Fran and her husband seperated, not divorced. nothing about the story she told on Stern's show... just fluff!"
2,"This came across as a weak, self absorbed, and whiny effort.","This book is a lesson of what not to do and how not to behave. Ms. Drescher is either very naive, or self absorbed in her own celebrity. Yes, a Hysterectomy is a very serious operation which many women have gone through. However, she fails to even acknowledge how lucky she was compared to Cancer patients who withstand hundreds of hours of Chemotherapy and weeks upon weeks of consecutive daily radiation treatment and more. She was never her own advocate until towards the end. She was always blaming everyone else. She saw low level Doctors and allowed herself to bleed profusely for almost two years before she finally moved up to higher level physicians. Who in their right mind would behave like this? Oh, the horror off an MRI or a CAT scan ........ Give me a break. There are plenty of Cancer survivors who are true courageous heroes, but Ms. Drescher is not one of them."
5,Like Reading An Email From Your Best Friend,"Reading this book is like getting a really long email from your best girlfriend - if she happens to be Fran Drescher! Imagine that when you do talk, you tell each other EVERYTHING, and that for some reason you guys have been out of touch for the last few turbulent years. Then, read on!This book is a lot of fun if you enjoy contemporary autobiographies, an honest account over a struggle with and victory over a life threatening disease, an insider view into stuff celebrities deal with, and/or are just looking for a fun, quick read over a weekend. I loved it. Amazon had reeled me in by recommending it based on my high review for Michael J Fox's book - also a great read with probably a bit more depth than this one - but this one is tops for girl-talk."
4,Too Much Information....But Still Enjoyed It!,"Too Much Information! I now know many, many private details of Fran Dreschers life. I read some of the book to my husband, and he found it to be too much for a squeamish stomach! But, I liked her writing. Her personality comes through loud and clear. It was an enjoyabe, quick read."
1,"Cancer, Schmancer, and Bowel Movements","I have to admit I didn't care much for this book. So often, it's easier to sit around and cry about problems than to do something about them.Fran gets the message across that women need to be more aggressive with their treatment, but it's all hindsight. Instead of going to parties and whining for two years, Fran should've hit the books and armed herself with research. I guess I was hoping to read a story about that kind of strength and intelligence. It's sad to see that Gilda Radner went through nearly the same situation ten years ago, and we haven't learned anything.There was an attempt at humor, but the fact I knew she had cancer that wasn't being treated overshadowed the jokes. Additionally, I could've done without the details of an immoral lifestyle and bowel movement changes."
1,As WHINEY as her voice,"From the back cover, a letter from Drescher to the readers, I expected a funny story about a harrowing experience, but all I got was a juvenille story of an immature woman. She says that it took eight doctors to diagnose her cancer, but she doesn't even seem thankful for the one who finally did. She spoke kindly of her nurses, but never thanked them. My mother being a nurse, I was offended that she didn't even express her thanks towards a nurse who gave her an enema every day! On the back cover Drescher says ""my attitude saved my life"" but her attitude was pretty [cruddy] from where I stand. I know that cancer is upsetting and you have a right to whine and complain. I don't know how anyone can see this book as uplifting."
1,Not worth buying,"While the information Ms. Drescher gives on her symptoms and warning signs are eye-openers, the book itself is a disappointing waste of paper. Her whining and pettiness has turned what was once a devoted fan of hers to someone who is so glad I don't have to live with someone so selfish and self-absorbed in my life. Wish I could get my money back from Ms. Drescher, no wonder she's not on TV anymore."
2,Sending a wrong message,I just briefly scanned through the book. I have to say I disagree with Fran that patients need to do their own research. It seems she is protecting the Doctors that should have known what diagnostic testing to do.It seems there is no accountablity in the medical profession when physicans are not knowing what diagnostic test to perform.I wonder if she pursued more than just a book.
4,Life and Illness after the Nanny,"Fran Drescher's last season of her hit TV show was traumatic for many reasons, her separation, the studio's decision to cancel, and most of all, she wasn't feeling well. This is the story of her search for the cause of her illness, diagnosis and her amazing recovery. She is a really good story teller. I finished the book in one day. You really find yourself rooting for her and her new life. Good read."
4,"Excellent - lively, fun, and very real","This was a great book! First of all, Fran is a strong and very honest woman. That came through loud and clear in the book. She talks very frankly about her relationships, and herself. And, I commend the support of her family in this because she revealed a lot of personal information in this book - and I'm sure that it took great support from them to be able to do so.This book is about empowering people, both woman and men. It's about taking charge of your life and your health care. It's a story of survival. It's also a story of coming to terms with who you really are and loving yourself.Read this book if you need to find the courage to overcome something difficult - you will learn a lot from Fran!"
5,Great,"Hey, my name is Carina Henzel, I am 23 and I teach English in Brazil. I bought and read Cancer Schmancer in 2002. As I loved it so much, I decided to get some my students to read it this year. So I ordered eight books from amazon.com and got them delivered quickly and in fine state.I totally recommend the book. It's great, informative and fun. It makes you laugh, cry and fall in love with the person Fran Drescher is. Amazing author, amazing text. I honestly loved it and my students are enjoying it a lot. Two thumbs up!"
2,Entertaining but Too Whiny,"I wasn't a fan of the Nanny t.v. show but when I saw the book I started reading it at the bookstore and ended up buying it. I sympathize with her ""year from hell"" (i.e., cancer, show cancellation, divorce, death of pet, etc.) but she doesn't seem to get how privileged she was having the means to excellent and exclusive healthcare. She also had the luxury to recuperate at leisure, be pampered by friends and family which most working women don't. Also, as savvy as Ms. Drescher is, I wondered why she didn't seek alternative medical advice too?It's funny in spots but the ""poor me"" drivel gets to you by the end of the book. Maybe if I'd known she had donated the proceeds of the book to a woman's cancer charity or something, I wouldn't be so hard on her. Instead, the cynic in me can see her on the talk shows promoting the book and herself with gusto."
2,Technically helpful but does not relate to the average woman,"Fran Dresher is a decent author. She clearly related her situation and technically, the details about her symptoms and tests she underwent are definitely helpful reading.However, most of this book will not be helpful to the average woman. Fran Dresher is someone who has the privillage of knowing money is no object and who's main concerns were extremely self involved. There is no worrying about work, missing work, making sure there was food on the table or the laundry done and house cleaned, etc, during and after such an illness. With the details out of the way, the recovery section seemed too selfish and privilaged to be considered helpful to other women and was more of a biography."
4,Blast from Past. Good memories,"Had to have this, as I don't have the originals anymore. As boy from 50's this is my time slot.Not a book to read, unless you are true fan. More book to flip through. No index or page numbers. Thick enough to be a door stop.Check it Out."
3,Not as bad as it could be.,"What we have here is a typical adventure yarn, with the heroes fighting for Truth, Justice, Etc. The US has the best of everything, the poor local Pakistanis just don't measure up. The good guys are good, the villain is bad. Shallow.Frankly, after Freehold, I expected better from Williamson. This is better than average for the genre--at least the technical details seem right, and no one gets blown yards back from explosions, legs flailing. But it's still right-wing chest-thumping gun porn. It was a bit of a let down."
1,Just awful,"Even by the standards of the genre, this book is atrocious. The writing is poor and riddled with military (and pseudo-military) jargon and acronyms that make it hard to read and disjointed. The characters are stereotypes, the dialogue is awkward and stilted, and the plot is entirely predictable. I wasn't looking for great literature when I picked this up to read at the beach, but this book managed to disappoint even my low expectations."
2,Unsatisfying,"The details may be right, but this never grabbed me. A work centered on action, but who cares?"
3,Attractive but...,"Overall, I think this set of china is very attractive. but I wish I had fully considered some issues. I didn't realize that the soup bowls are huge. They are more suitable for a hearty bowl of soup for lunch than for a first course of a dinner or a scoop of ice cream for dessert. Second, my set is made in Malaysia, but I purchased a separate serving bowl at the same time from Amazon, and it is made in China. The Chinese-made bowl is slightly yellower and the porcelain finish is not as nice. Now I am scared that if I purchase the smaller fruit bowls that they won't match the Malaysia-made set. Finally, the plates are very deep, over an inch, so they don't fit the prongs of my European Bosch dishwasher really well, which is made for thinner china."
3,Thank you,"These dishes are good ! It's the noise they make that drives us nuts, everyday! Quality is there though.Wouldn't do it again."
3,Why Stoneware?,"I like Mikasa. I have a set of Antique White china. I guess I don't get why anyone would get stoneware instead of china when they cost the same. Normally the china would be more but right now they cost the same for a 45 pc. set.I find the china just as versatile, lighter and muck more durable."
5,love love love,"I looked for a long time at dishes and these were absolutely perfect. Sturdy, but not so heavy, they will stand up to abuse. They arrived without a single flaw and look great in my kitchen. I like the fact you can microwave them. The gentle swirl pattern is classy and timeless."
3,Second thoughts,"I wrote a 5-star review of this set when I ordered it in 2008. The dishes are sturdy, attractive, and suitable for a variety of occasions. HOWEVER, shortly after I got them, I noticed grey streaks on them. I called Mikasa and the customer service rep told me they were metal marks from utensils. She told me to scour them with a little Bar Keeper's Friend or other mild scouring powder. I did, and the marks disappeared. I quickly became tired of doing this and now, a few years later, my most often-used pieces, especially the bowls, are COVERED in grey streaks, to the point where I wouldn't use them for guests. Unfortunately, the longer these marks are allowed to sit, the more difficult they are to remove. It is now four years later (2012) and I would not purchase this set again. I would rather have dishes I can just put in the dishwasher and not have to scrub with scouring powder."
3,nice dishes packed poorly,"The dishes are lovely. However, when they were delivered three of the items were broken. The packaging was far below par."
5,So Adaptable,"I've had a lifetime of pleasure and beautiful table settings with Mikasa French Countryside and passed on the ""tradition"" to my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas. Due to the simplicity and superb quality they will have a lifetime of use and enjoyment with this set. The greatest aspect is the adaptability ... tastes change over time but there's no need to replace your dinnerware ... it's a wonderful staple that I highly recommend."
2,"Nice to look at BUT...Hefty, Hefty, Hefty!","I love looking at these, but that's it. These dishes are ROBUST. They do NOT fit in the dishwasher very well. Whereas with other patterns, you can put the dishes in consecutive dishwasher slots, with these you have to skip a slot because they are so bulky. I wish I could go back in time and choose a different pattern. I finally got so sick of this problem that I put these away and got a much more manageable set. I'm going to sell my French Countryside on Craigslist. Live and learn. If you don't have a dishawasher and never plan on getting one, then these dishes will work well for you. Love the simplicity of the pattern and the beautiful white."
5,Death Of A Warrior,I like mystery and adventure novels and this is both. I live in the Pacific NW and enjoy the local places and descriptions. I hope he has a sequel soon. This is one book I will recommend to my bookish friends. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up ! Thank you for such a good read.
5,Will buy more in the future.,"I will definitely be purchasing more of these down the road and this is where I will get them from. Quick delivery, good price and quality product.."
1,This Place Sucks!,"They sent the wrong part and failed to communicate about the problem. I'm in Georgia, U.S., and they're located in Canada, so it's futile to try to return it. Now I'm stuck with a useless part, and out of 16.00!"
3,If Your On A Budget,"If your on a budget, these styli will do. These by far are not entry level styli, and they only go with the GrooveTool, which is definitely not looked highly upon. I've had mine for a couple of weeks, and they are still doing pretty well. Sound quality is... well... you get what you pay for! I plan on upgrading as soon as possible! But, I was on a budget. You have to start somewhere."
3,Welches Fruit Snacks,"The product is very tasty-however, the packages are rather small-not enough product in a package for the cost."
5,Calm and relaxation,"If you have a busy life style and sometimes have difficulty getting to sleep, Elixir of Dreams is just right for you.The light and pleasant scent of this mist on your pillow helps you to relax. So, breathe in deeply and let the soothing fragrances take you away to a place where your mind is calm and at peace."
2,Okay,"If you're putting pillow spray on, you want something great and fantastic. This is just meh. Probably never use it again. Way too much orange. Can't smell the lavender at all."
4,"Not sure it helps me sleep, but does smell lovely...","I don't really know if this product enhances drowsiness... but the soothing scent is bound to relax some people. I started to use this habitually when I got it and had to leave home for a week and didn't even think about bringing this with me... I definitely missed having it when I went to sleep at night. Small enough bottle to throw in a bag and I'll bring it with me next time I leave home. Bottle was much smaller than I imagined, but it doesn't seem as if this will be used up too quickly, even using it every night. Also received a free massager from the company when I purchased this... it was probably just a short term promotional gift, but that was a nice surprise! Company also shipped quickly."
2,"Instructions/oz., odor, etc.","The description did not mention the ozs. for this product. It is advertised as a pillow mist, yet instructions state to spray around the room over resting place. The odor is more valerian than lavender! Too citrus! Displeased with this product!Too expensive, especially since I don't use it."
4,"Pleasant smell, don't drop the bottle","I got this for a dd (9 years old) to help her fall asleep at night. The lavendar smell calms her down and she enjoys the nightly ritual of spraying her pillow before falling asleep. Unfortunately, one night she droped the bottle and the spray part of the bottle no longer works. It's not a twist-off bottle spray top so we had to figure out how to pop off the top, but we managed to pour the liquid in a different bottle...so far so good."
2,Great Aroma. Bad Dispenser.,"Arrived on time and in good condition. Aroma is awesome. Dispenser broke after three sprays. Difficult and messy to ""try and fix"". Not sure how many more sprays I will enjoy before it breaks again. I probably would have been a hooked customer who regularly purchased quantities of this item, however the broken dispenser is a huge obstacle for a product meant to ""relax"" you to over come. Love the Aroma, hate the dispenser."
5,Britax really is the best!,We love this seat! We also have a Graco chair for one of our cars but this one is by far the best. The material is very plush and cushy. The head rest is the best. When my daughter falls asleep in the Graco seat her head would end up in her lap because there was no where to rest it. With the Britax this is no longer a problem. The head rest is super supportive and makes a great pillow. I cant say enough about this product. We love it. Its totally worth the extra money!
3,Cute,"This is the cutest bear ever...but my granddaughter is so afraid of it. It has to stay in the closet. After looking at it (though it is cute), I kind of see what she means..It has pointy teeth and well, yeah."
3,Short reflective strip on one side only,This is a standard Premier leash with about 12 - 18 inches of glow in the dark/reflective tape sown on one side of the leash. I would have preferred the tape to be on both sides to increase visibility from more angles. We use this leash at night and our regular leash during the day. I'm not sure how long the reflective tape will last. Being placed close to the clasp means it is closer to the dog's head and less likely to be bent and broken off. The glow fades rather quickly once it has been charged by light.PROS:- reflective tape reflects well- placed near dog's headCONS:- tape only on one side of the leash- tape only 12 - 18 inches long- tape not long enough to show where the human is- glow fades quicklyIf it is on sale and you want a little more visibility at night then this leash may do the trick. I think a reflective collar may be a better idea as it would work from more angles.
1,Don't waste your money.,"The product is first of all made a little too flimsy for a large dog and second, most importantly the reflective part of the leash is only on the bottom 1/5 and only on one side. You'd be protected more with a reflective hat."
2,Technically it does not glow in the dark,"There is a short piece of reflective plastic sewn on the leash. Glow in the dark implies a continuously glowing light.otherwise, the product is sturdy enough for my small dog."
2,"Has a couple of good songs, the rest is just not worth listening to..","I was actually disappointed when I heard this CD. I expected this CD to be of the calibre of Poplitical, and Novo Millennium...which are two very good CDs. Unfortunately this is not one CD that I'd recommend you buying it... It has a couple of jazzy songs, which are good, but there are songs that pretty much will remind you of the times you sing on the shower, and ask yourself why weren't you invited to record this CD? Hope Ed Motta can eventually compose songs like the ones he used to...."
2,"no historical insights, just a simple narrative history","The book is a disappointment. It offers no general historical insights. I was expecting the author at least explained how and why an individual chose to be a eunuch, how the procedure was performed, how the society and families treated these people, how these people adjusted in the society, where did they come from, what is their daily lives... The author did NONE of these. The author simply wrote a narrative history of a few eunuchs. She wrote descriptive protraits of important eunuchs throughout history in chronological orders. The writing is detailed. For that, I gave a 3 point rating. But the reading is long, dry and boring. I only spent two hours on the book before I returned it."
2,A star for every time I wore it...,"...before the lace attaching the stocking to the belt broke. I don't feel like this should have happened, especially since I was not being 'rough' on it at all - unless sitting down and standing up throughout the day is somehow abusing the garment (I'm 5'0'' and around 130, so I don't think my body was straining the material more than usual, either). Other than that I had no issues; the material felt nice on my legs, my boyfriend appreciated them and when I wore them in public, people were impressed since they had never seen me in stockings before. I can't say I'd recommend this particular brand, though."
5,perfect for any holiday,"i am waiting to wear them in feburary for valientines day, they will look great with my dress and my boots."
5,Good deal...,"Shipped fast, they are well made, and better yet, are correctly sized, which isn't always the case with so many items. Good price as well."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"This is OK. I much prefer Inquisition Symphony Metallica (Tribute) by Apocalyptica. I preferred the four cellos of Apocalyptica to the over use of the violin in the String Quartet Tribute. In my opinion this album would have been much better if they had brought the violin down an octave or two. As it is, the violin sounds too whiney. It's not that I do not like violins, I love Vanessa Mae and Hilary Hahn's work, it is just that this album is almost painful to listen to.*UPDATE* After a few years, this isn't actually that bad (or it has grown on me), I have added a star from the initial review. It is much better for background, though still not recommended for active listening."
5,Beautiful sheets!!!,"This set was purchased for Christmas in Vanilla for my Mother and Stepfather. The embroidery detail is beautiful and the colour very nice. The sheets feel fine and at the price I paid, $19.99, was an incredible value. Highly recommended. I have purchased three sheet sets from Touch of Paradise (Heartfelt in King- ordered today for $12.99- and Butterfly in Queen) and have had nothing but great things to say."
1,Same bad review as the previous guy,"I got it with the battery already installed and out of power--almost to zero instead of 9 volts.I am installing it right now and it does not seem to pick up the alarm from my other alarm, even if I had the volume to high. This is not new it is a used one. It did not have instructions. Nothing.. Very dissapointed. Do not buy this. I am just sorry I did not read the previous review.I am actually now editing my review. It does work, but only when the true alarm is sounding, it would not work on the test mode of the alarm. If you are using it in conjunction with another alarm, it would use up the phone line and your main alarm may not have a dial tone, even if you have a gsm with a regular phone line---which I have, and it definitely is not working that way--"
1,Amazon ships used/refurbished.,I bought this item with a lot of other Skylink items from Amazon. All the other Skylink came in the same plastic style packaging except this one came in an ordinary cardboard box. Which I thought was a little odd. Then I open the box and no instructions. Because the instructions are usually inside the plastic pack. Then I opened the battery cover and there was the battery already installed with the plastic protection that you normally have to rip off the 9 volt batter already ripped off. This item is clearly a return/used/refurbished item. That Amazon has repackaged and shipped under the description of new. I am not at all happy to see Amazon taking the same route as Overstock and shipping out refurbished items as new. I will be returning this one and expect a packaged one if I wanted used I would of bought used.
3,Not what I wanted,"I bought this CD single hoping to hear the remix that I've been hearing on the radio. Although the mixes are OK, it's still not what I wanted. As much as I find Enrique very talented, the original version of this song is not very good, except for the remix version that I can't find."
1,Not quiet enough!,"The wheel is a little ""sqeeky"". It is not whisper silent as advertised. I am happy with it only because it's better than our old one (which is better than nothing). It's a little small for a teddybear hamster."
2,Musicians music,Melodically not interesting or exciting. Virtuosity from top-musicians. Dennis Chambers is for drummers always interesting to listen to. I don't believe that Bireli Lagrene is on his best here; I'll listen to his Django Reinhardt style.
4,Nice to find this in larger quantities,"My local grocery only carries the single servings. I was glad to find this on Amazon so that I could make 2 quarts at a time. I really wish Crystal Light would make it in a loose powder (like Tang used to be made) so I could make one serving or a quart or 2 quarts, etc., at a time. I like the Classic Orange flavor best so far."
3,Someone is right Chris should stay as a comedian stand-up,"I don't get it why they sings in the end? lol, it is dumb. It is okay anyway. If you wanna a serious marriage consuleor movie, i wouldn't highly reccomded this one. my opinion that marriage opening-eyeing is ""Fireproof"" or ""Not Easily Broken"" by TD Jakes . This movie is just a comedian about marriage , it seems seneless anyway"
2,It's just not funny.,"I think this is Rock's debut as a director. It certainly seems so, as he elicits only wooden performances from the actors, including himself. My wife and I only made it through the first 40 minutes of the film. The movie isn't rooted in any sense of reality; characters say things to each other that are in complete contrast to their circumstances. Example- five minutes after meeting up with the old flame from years ago, she's asking Rock, ""Do you and your wife still f*** ?"" Please."
3,Review,It was an ok movie a little corny but entertaining. There was a message to the story I like Chris Rock and Kerry Washington...
1,Bad Movie,I always make it a point to see as many black movies as possible. This was the worst I'd seen in a long time.
2,The two saving graces of this movie?,"Steve Buscemi and Mr. ""Gilmore"". I found this flat, boring and uneven. I love Chris Rock but this movie was just a snooze."
2,He should have done it...,"The movie portrays his wife as an unfriendly, condescending witch who withholds sex.Missed opportunity, Rockhead!"
1,Worst ever,"This is hands down the worst movie I've seen in a long time, and I am a Chris Rock fan. The plot is incredibly slow, the characters aren't well developed, and the movie was so bad I couldn't even finish it. Don't waste your time."
2,Blah,I love me some Chris Rock but this one just didn't do it for me. I watched this last night and it had its funny moments (like when he is dancing to Laffy Taffy) but nothing to gut busting. I just knew he was gonna get some after he took her out (the viagra scene) but nope. Everyone has already told you what the basics of the movie. It's worth renting but not worth purchasing. I don't know what her issues were with sex but its definately IMO the ending was just WACK!!
2,not funny,"Chris Rock's latest movie starts out on a promising note, but looses momentum till it burns itself in the ending. It slides from funny to generally gross and to downright annoying. In its paths there are a lot of racial jokes, sexual innuendos, and a certain way-over-the-top Viagra incident. Because the ending is what the audience remembers most (as it is the last thing they saw), the movie looses whatever goodwill it earned in the beginning. And that's really a shame - this movie could've been so much more. Rock's usual antics are often either funny or disturbing and in this movie they prove to be more of the latter than the former, still he carries the entire picture on his shoulders alone, with the supporting staff getting in his way rather than helping."
2,Stick with Stand Up Comedy,"Chris Rock is hilarious as a stand up comedian. But trying to turn his ""married and bored, single and lonely"" routine into a movie was a bad idea. Not funny at all."
4,Directors blew the ending,"Yeah very good BUT,Dear Chris Rock,Dang man how could you end the movie like you did without giving the wife a reason to change her cold demeanor. What a crock of an ending, a sane married person is supposed to believe a cold prude like that is just going to change without going through something herself? Ok, she may not need to get some strange PERHAPS but she sure as heck needs to at least think about it, JUST LIKE YOUR CHARACTER! Dang man, you had an opportunity to make a poignant, demonstrative and meaningful ending and threw it away instead for a conventional, undistinguished VANILLA ending. Somehow my friend, the ending just doesn't seem to be penned alone by your own wit. Suppose the director had a hand in maintaining your pigeon-holed style that has proven sales. Still worthy, if you work and play in Disneyland, U.S.A."
2,This movie was pretty wacked!,"The movie was not as funny as you would think, but it did have its moments. Nonetheless, the ""girl on the side"" was hot, but probably not worth the price of admission. Reedee if you don't wait till it comes out on dvd."
3,"Date movie, nothing more","I found this movie entertaining, having viewed it on ""on-demand,"" on a day that I had nothing else to do. This is a good date movie, nothing more. I think Chris Rock could have taken many of the scenarios a bit further, which would have made for a funnier film. One of my few complaints is that the hilarious Orlando Jones wasn't in the movie longer, or cast as the lead! Orlando Jones' 2 minutes inside the CD store, as Kerry Washington's demented ex, is hands down the funniest scene of the whole movie. He should have been cast as the lead if you ask me. Id suggest folks watch this for one of three reasons 1. Kerry Washington in a bra & thong. 2. Orlando Jones' brief scene. 3. Kerry Washington in a thong & bra in this movie!"
2,Chris Rock is Brilliant! What happened here?,I was expecting a comedy. Chris Rocks takes on marriage in his standup are hilarious. And Louis CK is no slouch. I was soooo disappointed. This movie was just depressing.
1,Expensive Piece of JUNK,"To whom it may concern,If you like spending your money on JUNK, this would be a good place to start. I own two of these units and they both suck. One could get deeply involved with all the ins, outs, ups and downs of the i-drive Garage Door Opener,but why? Take the advice from the already good reviews of a bad product and save yourself the cost and frustration and just don't buy it!!! If I can save just one person from Wayne Daltons version of 'Garage Door Opener Hell', it's a good day.PS. One star is too good for the hundreds of dollars wasted on this product."
1,Stay away from Wayne Dalton,"My new home was finished one-year ago complete with a Wayne Dalton garage door and the iDrive Torquemaster motor. The iDrive is a nice idea but it is one big mistake. It worked intermittently for almost a year. Then it would not close properly at all. So, I called the guy who installed it and he blamed me for the problem and made adjustments to fix it. He said that I did not call him soon enough. I have had garage doors with openers for many years. None of them have failed on me even after 10-years of use. The Dalton opener began having issues within months and then failed totally in a year. The installer blamed me. Never again!!"
1,Look Elsewhere,I have a 9100 door and an I-drive and have spent $300 on repairs in the first three years of ownership. I suggest looking for a conventional opener and door spring assembly
2,Frustrating door,"We got ours with the new home we moved into 6 years ago. The first 2 years or so, everything was great. Then we started having problems with the door stopping/sticking in cold Iowa winters. At first, it only happened on below zero days... then it would happen in the teens, now it happens if it is in the mid 30's overnight. It also used to happen rarely on very hot/muggy days. I assume this door is uber senstive to temperature which throws it out of balance. Anyways, it just started doing the whole, I'm closed, but I'm going to open right back up on my own thing... and today... it just beeps and says screw you, I'm not working at all. It has not been worth it."
1,Don't do business with Wayne Dalton,"After replacing the motor several times, I find out that the model is discontinued (for obvious reasons, I would argue). No satisfaction from company...Warantee not applicable, even though motor is only 2 years old...Rude service representative...Take your business elsewhere...and tell your friends."
2,iDrive issues,"We have several iDrive openers in our complex. They seem to break a lot. Mine has failed three times in less than a year, and I don't use it very much. I have just replaced the iDrive with one of the more conventional older units.Last time my iDrive failed, the manual override wouldn't work either. Fortunately my car was still outside at the time!"
1,Crap,"Same problems with many on here. When it works, it works well. So long as the temp doesn't drop or the cable doesn't get tangled around the torsion bar.... in which case it's a pain in the ass. I'm converting back to the traditional-style opener."
2,Works great...for awhile,"Have had this unit for 6 years now, and getting ready to switch to different technology. It's a great idea but I suspect the company, under American management, made the absolute minimum quality motor they could get away with. System died after 3 years. Dalton sent me a free replacement motor so that wasn't too bad. System just died again, 3 years later, and it's 6 degrees out. It's not worth my time to replace it again, even if it is free, because I'll just have to do it again in another 3 years.American managements are training me, and probably many other Americans, to avoid products from American companies when quality is important. Cars, lawnmowers, laundry equipment, basically anything that has moving parts. American companies now seem to design things to the minimum quality they can get away with in order to maximize profit. Pity they don't seem to realize, or maybe it's that they don't care, about the long term consequences for the company."
1,"iDisaster: Can't give it half a star, so it gets one star.","The idrive is a disaster. The logic board got replaced regularly as in four times. The door would open only occasionally. The service techs hated the drive. We paid for a lifetime warranty and they got a flat fee. Then I find out that Wayne Dalton thinks my lifetime is five years. Whoops - the lifetime warranty is on the motor. I paid for professional installation. I had to pay $50 for their extension cord to get the ""lifetime"" warranty. This is a scam. No wonder major retailers stopped carrying this product.Besides being a disaster in terms of electrical engineering, the mechanical engineering is worse. I ended up having to take my garage door apart just to get the car out. Then I had to take the drive apart just to operate the garage door manually.Hurry and buy one for that brother-in-law you can't stand before this junk is taken off of the market."
5,"Simple, sturdy and fabulous!","A great toy for any kid 3-6ish. Buy in conjuntion with Tubations so there are enough tubes and couplers to make it fun. It is amazing how many configurations kiddos come up with, using simple tubes and couplers. Great to build motor skills, engineering, and imagination."
3,Neat idea but not well made,"My 3 yr old son really likes this toy, but he gets frustrated when using it because the pieces do not stay put together well enough. It often falls to pieces in his hands while he is trying to blow into it."
2,Poor quality,"We received this as a present for our son who loves musical toys. The pieces are inconsistent in size so if you tilt the instrument down (as you do with a sax or recorder) the pieces fall off--very frustrating for a young child. Also, the mouthpiece without the other pieces attached is basically a potentially loud whistle, so you won't be letting your kids play with it anyway after they figure this out. A kazoo or recorder is a better way to go."
2,Fell apart too easliy,"We got this for Christmas for our three and four year olds who love music and marching around with instruments, but this is already going into the giveaway box, as I purchased it from a local, rather fussy, toystore, and I doubt they'll take kindly to my returning it opened and used. Maybe we purchased a defective set, but the pieces fit together loosley enough that they twist around according to gravity, so our kids cannot actually re-configure it and have it stay that way, and then it easily slips apart. I'm looking for toys that promote dexterity and encourages my son especially to use his tree-finger grip as opposed to his whole hand to maneuver them, and this was easily manipulable for him, but he became frustrated whenever it fell apart, which happened too frequently. I know this brand has high reviews, and the durability of the plastic is very good, but it just didn't work as a toy that encourages creativity through trial and pleasure- it was trial and frustration."
5,Great value,"We just picked this up at Franklin's General Store in Hyattsville. It is a cool combination of building toy, as well as musical instrument. For only $10 you can't really miss with this one. For more information on other toys and things to do in the D.C. area see parentcompassdc.blogspot.com"
4,Great Little Toy,"I bought this toy as gift for my 4 yr old nephew. He loved it, thanking us over and over for getting him such an 'awesome toy'. The sound is more shrill than I had expected which is the only reason I give it a 4 instead of 5. I love the toy's versatility to become whatever budding imaginations want it to be. This is a great toy that I expect will last the test of time."
3,Loud!,"My 3 year old grandson has more fun putting it together in different ways than in playing it, but maybe later he will like to try more playing."
1,not worth the plastic it's wrapped in,"Who would have thought that a Sony item with a retail value of $137.21 would come in a blister pack? I thought when I was buying this item it would not be at all like the Wal-Mart variety. Well I decided to give it a try. The wires for hooking up the player in a vehicle is like a spider web. Once you take care of setting it all up it wasn't all that bad. That is until 3 or 4 days into minimal use the left channel decided to quit working. I tried several CD's and even installed it in a friends car to check it out still no go. If you are buying this item for use in a vehicle I suggest that you shop around, spend a little more money and get something thats worth it. I think when they put a picture of a product in an ad it should show it in its original packaging. I ended up getting a double shipment of this item which I must say Amazon took care of with no problem at all they were great."
1,Don't let the brand name fool you!,"Like I said, don't let the fact that this is a Sony product cloud your mind, and make you buy this player without thinking twice. That's what I did. Like other reviewers have said, this plays very low with the car adapter, and I had to turn the volume up REALLY HIGH to get anything to come out, which in turn created a big buzzing noise with my speakers (my car is fairly new, and I used a brand new CD, so it is the player). That's my main problem, and there's not much more I can say since I am returning it ASAP. Plus the buttons are thin, therefore harder to press. My score is based mainly on the fact that the car adapter was advertised, and didn't deliver at all."
2,Low Quality,"Yes, for a minute it looks like a good cd player w/mp3 and g-protection. But,1 it doesn't play the last songs2 it's sound quality is low3 the headphones are hard to put onSo, my word is DON'T BUY IT OR IF YOU DID, RETURN IT!"
2,Several years later and still haven't improved!,"I recently bought this because my cd changer died. I had my first cd walkman about 10 years ago and did not like the low volume and background noise. I thought they would have improved these after so many years (so the sales lady told me). I was wrong! You have to turn the vehicle volume so low that you just know you will blow those speakers. Beware-if you change to the next song, you will hear this loud beep. The buttons are small. I could not listen to my cd's and will be returning as soon as possible."
2,skipper,"I used this player primarily for listening to while walking around. It began to skip A LOT after about a year of use. I had to bang on it to make it stop, and that only made it fall apart faster."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"i was very dissapointed with this product. it worked fine right until the warranty expired, then all it did was cause me grief, resulting in me just throwing it away."
3,A solid text with one flaw.,"I used this book as a text for a legal-drafting course I taught. It is exhaustively researched and well written. Its advice is contemporary and sound. My only problem with it was the approach. Early in the text, you are introduced to ""the seven steps of drafting,"" and you get a thorough run-down on these steps. Then the remaining chapters of the book treat different kinds of drafted documents and explain how the seven steps apply to those documents. But it gets repetitive and tedious after a while.For example, the seventh step is ""edit and revise."" Yet once you have been instructed on how to edit and revise, how different can that step be for contracts as opposed to wills, as opposed to pleadings, as opposed to legislation? Not much different. So you find yourself reading through the seven steps in each chapter, when only two or three of the steps are any different from what's been said before."
2,One reader's treasure is another's trash,"Unlike a previous reviewer who thought the dream sequences one of the best parts of the book - they drove me to distraction. As did the constant jumping from season to season and character to character. Why must each of her books (well, at least the two I have read) have character's with mental problems in them -- and why do I have to unscramble their visions? This did not add to the story for me. I do so want to like this author - the plots are good, many of her characters are interesting, and she can write well - but I find the writing style to be too confusing and hard to follow."
4,Telepathy a pain?,This is a good book that shows how much of a pain having telepathic abilities can be. Magnus is hidding in a bedlam (a mideval insane asilum) when one of his largest strengths become his biggest weakness.
4,Krusell Arm Strap with Multidapt,"This is a one-size-fits-all product that uses velcro to adjust the strap to your arm size. During running I have found it necessary to be very careful to maximize the amount of velcro contact, or the strap will come loose. To do this I have to tighten the strap to a point that is somewhat uncomfortable. But the strap does work. Part of my problem is probably the weight of my cell phone / pocketpc. This strap would likely be perfect for a very light device."
1,Ditto on this terrible product.,"I agree totally with the above review - it simply does not ""play"" in a Sony 8mm camcorder. I tried it in both of mine, and all it did was pull the ""tape"" out of the shell and jam, requiring a manual removal as it did for the other reviewer. I don't know how we are going to clean these heads, now that the Sony dry cleaner is no longer available."
1,Do not buy this Junk!,This cleaner got jammed the first time I used it so bad that I had to take my camcorder in to have it removed. Spend a bit more and get the Scotch Professional 8mm Camcorder Head Cleaner. That's what I have now and it works great with My Sony Camera every time! I guess you get what you pay for.
1,SUCKS BIG TIME,"Jeff Burton directed the film he also edited it, produced it, screen wrote it, he was the camera man, he did the sound design, he did the blood and physical effects, and at the end he sent special thanks to the Burton family ""his family"" who seem to make the movie from A-Z no wonder why this movie sucks.DON'T WATCH IT"
2,Ugghhh,"Yes, this is made by Lionsgate, I love Lionsgate because of SAW. My friend's dad (Donnie Wahlberg) *He was in SAWs II-IV as detective eric matthews and in Dead Silence as the detective) said he saw a little clip from Acts ofDeath and that the clip was good. I found out what clip it was, the only good clip on the movie. This movie is boring and has boring deaths, don't bother with this one!!!"
3,Lost Clips,"Used these for one week at summer camp archery program. The size was good, but the clips are not the best option. When loosening the arm guard to the end of the elastic band, the clip slides right off. I tried using a lighter to cauterize the ends and make them thicker but to little avail. In addition, clips may pinch the wearer. In the future I recommend velcro guards."
3,"Good, but not great","Christoffer Boe creates another sophisticated and intriguing drama. The semblance is once again stylish and surreal, however this second film of his ultimately fails to deliver. So much time is dedicated to the construction of the crux that the payoff, while meaningful, does not reward the viewer for their patience. This film has much style and substance, but in the end it slightly misses it's mark."
1,Road Warrior defeated in less than 1 year,I bought this battery for my wife's cell phone last Christmas (2000) Last week (7/2001) the battery quit working. Even though it shows a full charge it dies after less than a minute of talk time. I would not recommend this product.
5,Befriended by Innocence Mission ....,I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for an audio engineer where I record. He is a fan of Innocence Mission and I happen to know Mike Bitts ... base player for the group. Mike is going to have everyone autograph the CD for me. This CD had 5-star reviews so I hopped on it. I'm very excited to give the gift. The CD PLUS the autographs!!!!!! Wow ... It's going to be GREAT!!!!!
4,Great music on a short album,"While I am a devout Innocence Mission fan and enjoy their latest effort's beautiful, spare folk music that I've come to expect from this gifted band, I have two minor complaints: First, the album, around 35 minutes, is too short. Second, there is a sameness to the music with some exceptions. Having said this, the album is a must-buy, not just for the canvass of mellifluous sounds throughout, but for track 6, which is one of the most distinct, haunting melodies I've ever heard by the Innocence Mission."
5,Fun for Creative Children!,"This was a gift for my grandson's tenth birthday. He loves to draw and has a great imagination. He started using the book immediately-drew an igloo and ""added"" an eskimo. These books are fun and educational-good addition to ""how-to"" libraries for children and adult artists."
4,son loves it,My 9 yr old son loves to draw. This has helped him and he loves it. It has helped him learn more about how to draw buildings.
4,"Quite good, more basic than I imagined","Good, simple book. More basic than I imagined. Good for children. A little too simple for better artists."
4,Draw Buildings--Step-by-step,This is a wonderful and fun activity for someone who may be interested in trying to draw buildings and bridges. It was purchased as a gift.
5,Thanks for shipping by Christmas Eve! Looks great!,Package arrived in time for Christmas and I believe my 12-year old daughter will love it! The illustrations seem to break down the drawing into manageable steps.Thanks for getting the book here by Christmas Eve! Looks great!
4,Baby loves to feed himself!,"My nearly eight month old has been using this for two months and he loves it. His eyes light up the second he sees it coming. The first time he used it he instantly seemed to understand what it was for...he loves watermelon but we had a choking scare and bought this, so now he can enjoy all his favorite fruits safely, and feel like a big boy for feeding himself. He still has trouble with his pincer grasp to pick up food on his own, so this is the perfect solution. I would have given five stars if it weren't for the slight difficulty cleaning it, but it isn't impossible. The replacement bags also seem to be on the spendy side but luckily I haven't needed any yet since I have been able to get the bags clean by just turning them inside out and washing them briskly in hot soapy water."
3,great idea but needs to be improved,"I agree that these are hard to clean. With each use, the net has to be turned inside-out and rinsed carefully and then soaked in a cup with a water and a drop of bleach to get them back to white. The other parts I have always washed in the dishwasher. I am giving this only 3 stars, even though my DD loves eating fruit from these, because she has thrown them on the floor each time she's done and the green ring on BOTH of them is now cracked. I think they need to improve on the type of plastic they are using."
4,Baby likes it,"Works really well for ice cubes and frozen blueberries, but frozen bananas made the bag really hard to clean. Baby loves chewing on it, so it works for that purpose!"
4,Baby Loves This! Bags Aren't Dyed! Made in US,"I chose this soft food feeder because it was made in the US and the feeder bags weren't dyed. Why on earth would I want my baby to suck on a purple feeder bag when he can suck on an undyed one?These are easy for my 5.5 month old to handle, and in my experience clean up pretty easily it you turn it inside out and scrub with a toothbrush as soon as he's done.These are definitely an improvement over the cheesecloth that I was previously wrapping pieces of fruit in, though we'll see how durable they are once he's gotten some teeth."
3,Good idea,"I really like the idea of the feeder and think it can work pretty well. The reason it did not get five stars from me is that they are so hard to keep clean once you use them. I washed them by hand and ran them through the dishwasher, but for some reason all of the food never came out. Perhaps it was my fault for putting bananas and other squishy pieces in because once the food was mushed in there it was all over. I think they may work better with more solid food that does get caught in all the little holes. Like I said, really like the idea, but I need a better way to get all of the mashed food out once you use it!"
2,save you money,"My daughter hated these.....you try ""eating"" thru a net. Cleaning these are a pain. Dont put bananas in them!"
3,Incorrect Advertising,"If you look at the package, it says it is 25 feet long...well, it isn't. It's only 20 feet long. Please look into getting this corrected. Also, your dimensions are off...it is stated to be 4 by 4 by 12. Should be 12 inches by 20 feet. I can normally count on all descriptions to be accurate, but even after someone else complained, IT IS STILL INCORRECT."
2,Difficult to cut - better products out there,"I did not like this product. I tried to use it to cover all of the shelves and drawers in my kitchen and thought it was not very good quality, difficult to cut, and impossible to clean.Instead I recommend the Duck non-adhesive shelf liner.CONS:- very difficult to cut, especially because of the ridges- IMPOSSIBLE to clean, because of the ridges- small items are unbalanced on top of the surface because of the ridges (the ridges are definitely a negative theme here!)- hard to lay fully flat, too stiffI do not recommend. At least look for something without the ridges and that is not so stiff!"
4,"Not bad, will last a long time.","Liner was a little different than I anticipated but overall I'm satisfied. I'm glad I purchased the ribbed liner even though I'm primary using this to line closet shelving. This fits the width of the shelving perfectly and is easily cut to fit length. If I need more, I would purchase this again."
5,The very best shelf liner,"I have been using this for years and will keep using it. And whenever I have strayed for a cheaper shelf liner, I've regreted it."
5,name says it all,"This is an excellent product. I bought a roll many years ago and it has performed well ever since. It's easy to clean and cut to size, and has a substantial heft. I'm glad to find this on Amazon. I'll be buying more soon."
5,perfect,"parfait, livraison et qualité nickel, qualité du produit fidèle à description.rapidité d'envoi sans aucun problème malgré la distance. k7 bien protegée pour le transport."
2,Doesn't work for sheep,"I tried this a few different times on our trees to keep our sheep from nibbling on the bark, and it didn't phase them. I have never tried it for other pets or items so don't know if it will work elsewhere."
5,Thoughtful,"Surprisingly contemporary! Wit, intelligence overflowing. What a discovery! I got it for my wife, and we're both enjoying it. Sent it to a literary friend as well."
5,A Beautiful Book!,"The illustations in this book are amazingly beautiful and delightful. The gentle text is perfect for a bedtime story for children, with a mesmerizing message for those of all ages who have the heart to hear. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
1,Super stomachs by Denise Austin,"The VHS that was in the container was not what was advertised on the holder.Inside was a long work out, very different than the 15 minutes stomach that the container advertised.We sent it back hoping for a return in the postage and fee charged for the VHS.The title wasSuper stomachs by Denise Austin."
4,:],"The buffalo is really cute, but the truth is the horns are also black, not orange as depicted. My friend loved it as a birthday present, but the texture is not very soft. It feels more rough and tough. Overall, the buffalo scored high with my friend's rating, but truthfully I wish it had a soft touch to it and had orange horns."
1,Threads Strip too easy. NOT Well made,Don't buy this CRAP !!! They are the worst garbage I have ever purchased. You would expect this kind of garbage from the dollar store. Not made for actual street riding but for show.
5,"Great music, great show!","I first saw this video on an airplane last year and loved it. I was immediately hooked as a Manilow fan. Never really listened to Manilow music before seeing this. HEs a great performer, some say greater than ever. And this show is awesome. He walks around the room, shaking hands with audience, even dancing with some. And his last number is just him a microphone and the empty room with chairs. But he fills the room with magic like u were there with him."
3,I was in the audience,"I was at the taping for this PBS special. I am a fan, not a seat-filler; although there were MANY MANY seat-fillers in the audience that had the better seats (probably what you saw most of). The show was taped in 2 nights. What you saw on the PBS special was mostly done on the 2nd night and that's the night I was in the audience. Where we sat; we had no view; or very little view of Manilow. EXCEPT for when he did Copacabana (great new arrangement of it by the way!) and when he came around at the end during the medley. You can see my friend and I in the audience during the song ""Daybreak."" It was an interesting experience being in the audience for this taping. Most interesting as to how they put the final show together. Although I more of a fan of Manilow's original work (the covers of the 50's, 60's, and 70's aren't my thing); it's still one of those feel-good PBS shows that you'll be watching for years to come."
3,Motsenbocker lift-off,"I ordered this product to remove nail polish from carpet. It worked pretty well. I used the whole little bottle in about 3 applications. The problem with this product was that one of the tops on one of the little bottles was not tight. It leaked all over the package and the other two bottles. Luckily not the one I needed, but it was very oily and a big mess. Please shipper make sure lids are tight."
3,review of the best book ever- Eldorado,"In the gold rush time, a fourteen year old girl named Maude and her father moved to the Yukon. Maude is pretty much by herself when her mother gets ill and dies, and her father in the mines and forces Maude to move to one town another. But one time she decides to stay in a camp mine of El Dorado. In El Dorado Maude is forced to work in boarding school owned by Mrs. Stechlers. In her stay she meets up with many people such as a apache girl called Annie, a young cowboy code, and two close friends of Venus Gynne and Kate. How Maude Handles her life and he's to deal with new problem with .Being by herself in the new frontier make this an fun time to read .And any who likes to read, will love this one."
4,One Student's Point of View,"The title would perhaps be equally accurate if changed to ""Experiences of a Sufi Student"" because it is based on the author's travels with Idries Shah during the 1970s. A student's viewpoint is refreshing because certain questions that the reader may have arise more naturally in the context of seeing a fellow seeker encounter new experiences and ask his guide about them. On the other hand, readers may feel they are wading through a lot of hagiographic references to Shah's accomplishments.The account of the author's visit to a Zavia (dervish monastery) in Yemen includes some truly astonishing events. The subsequent chapter has equally amazing material on Nuristan, but the ""wondrous oil"" described by the author therein is simple enough to make and test for oneself -- I found it quite beneficial for healing bruises."
3,Worse than the movie,"I'll admit that I'd never herd of Werd before the movie, but I'm incredibly glad I found out it was a book first. This is an amazing piece of fiction. I agree with one of the previous reviewers in saying that I wish I had read the book before seeing the movie, but what the hell, they're both awesome. If you don't know anything about the story, there's this guy (called, mostly, Johnny Werd) who blows up the world in junior high then goes on to be a temp worker. It's a really quick read, but it's awesome. The movie is great too, but if you haven't seen it yet, read the book first. The movie follows the book pretty closely, although the endings are different."
1,Poorly made bench,"What a poorly made bench. The inside of the bench, where you should have wood holding the thing together is made of cardboard !!!! Just sitting on it destoried one of those cardboard pieces on the one we have. What a waste of money !!!"
1,"Little substance, not worth buying","This really wasn't what I expected. It is literally an alphabetical listing of childhood illnesses with a BRIEF blurb about the illness, symptoms and treatments. It is not very detailed and does not include all illnesses one might be concerned about. Provides no way for referencing by symptom... Very elementary test.... I can not recommend it at all."
5,A to Z baby child medical book stoppard,I love it! This book was given to me by a very dear friend15 yrs ago! Still use it.
4,diagnostic! specific! an easy reference!,"A number of child-care books have the frustrating problem of being too vague. For example, a number of books I own will say something along the lines of: ""if there is X symptom, call your doctor."" But I want to know what does X symptom mean? Why is it occurring and why do I need to call the doctor? This book is helpful in these regards.You look up a symptom such as ""rashes"" and it will lead you to the various diseases/illnesses that express themselves with rashes, and you can try to figure out which one best fits your child. The book is also arranged alphabetically so that you can look up, e.g., ""diarrhea"" and it will list the common causes, the symptoms, how to treat it, whether you should consult a doctor, what the doctor might do, etc.A very useful diagnostic tool.(If it came with photographs rather than drawings, I would give it 5 stars.)"
2,What a Dull Beat,"Th prequel, Avenging Angel, was great! This, however, is as boring as it's front cover.The story about a teenage runaway is difficult to get through ,for boredom."
4,Good Start,"I loved ""Little House in Brookfield,"" talking about the struggles and the hardships as well as the joys and the triumphs of frontier farm life. I only wish Caroline could come to life. Was she really like that? I can understand as an adult, but to me, it seemed like (and I know it sounds stupid) it wasn't Caroline in the book, it was Ma. I liked it when Caroline showed a little spark with her sister. Other than that, the book was well-written and great. I LOVED Martha. She's awesome! Overall, this book is, though not as classic as Laura and Rose, one that is fun to read."
4,A very nice book!,"After having read all the original Laura's Little House books, and having finished with the Martha and the Charlotte books, I have now turned to the Caroline books. It is wonderful as usual! I loved it! Though I like better to read of the older years of the Little House girls and Caroline here is 5-6 years old, it is still very interesting to see how they live out there in 1845. Caroline's childhood is very different from her grandmother's, mother's and daughter's childhoods because she has no father and her widowed mother tries to run the farm alone. The children all help her as much as they can, and this makes little Caroline seem much older than she really is. I look forward to continue reading about Caroline."
5,Caroline is a lot like Laura,"Caroline showed a lot of heart with her sister like Laura did with Mary when they grew up. I like the way Caroline, like Laura, took charge. These books, like the ones that are about Laura make the country side come to life. The travel and the covered wagons are made to sound like a lot of fun."
3,"Shallow, but okay for light reading...","This whole series is rather thin and shallow. It offers a good glance into pre-statehood Wisconsin, but is completly fabricated because it is based on bits from letters. You can't tell how Caroline is as a character. It makes some good historical fiction reading, but that is all."
2,Rather forgetable,"While I would recommend this book to Little House junkies, it is not at all up to the quality of Laura Ingalls Wilder or MacBride's books. The author wrote this series based on information included in a few letters, and this is entirely apparent in the characterisation and feel of the series. That being said, if you've finished the current book in the Rose series and are desperate for more you will want to read it anyway."
1,New edition not good,I got this book for christmas and had not read it till now. We own another one that is very old and I was expecting it to be the same and it is not. They make it simpler but boring. They take out whole chapters and make great changes to the rest. I am really disopointed as Laura Ingalls Wilder probably did not want her books changed. I am truly disopointed that they changed it.
4,a blast from the past,"This one will take you back in time...way back. The unique sound of this Chilean group, so popular in the '70's, with hits that were melodic and noted for Germaine De La Fuente's high, tremulous voice, and the very simple ""pop"" sounding arrangements, which included a lot of electric organ.On this CD compilation they do a bouncy arrangement of Jose Alfredo Jiménez' ""Despacito"", ""Murio la Flor"" was written by Germaine and showcases the strength of his voice, as does Orlando Salinas' ""Como Quisiera Decirte"", but my favorite is the muy romantico standard ""Tres Palabras"" which has a tune that keeps me humming it hours after hearing it.Like most of these compilations of older songs, the package has a one page insert with only a song/composer list, nothing more...but dig those hip sideburns on that cover photo !"
4,get more for less,"these look good for everyday...and for those of you contemplating more, Amazon sells the red or white in boxes of 12 for $29:Libbey 17-Ounce Stemless White Wine, Box of 12 and/or Libbey 16-1/2-Ounce Stemless Red Wine, Box of 12"
3,Glasses for wine,"Well, the glasses are pretty nice for serving white wine in them. Dont plan on hearing that magical ting sound when you hit two glasses together. Its sounds more like thud than anything but hey not bad for what you pay."
2,"Ok quality, but cheap, thick glass","These are well-made, but have the thick glass feel of cheap wine glasses. The shape is kind of boring too. I prefer my set from IKEA of all places, but got these as a gift for a friend. Good price, but you get what you pay for."
4,Nice Affordable Wine Glasses (Stemless),"If you like stemless wine glasses, these glasses are more than adequate. At the rate we break glasses, these are very affordable. Actually, they're very economical anyway. You can't beat the price and the quality is excellent. We mostly drink red wine, but the white wine glasses are our choice. Excellent deal."
4,"Good price, Good Value","I got these for my sister for Christmas. She has been very happy with them so far, and I can't tell much of a difference between these and the Riedel ones."
4,good for the price,"I purchased these as a ""secret santa"" present for my coworker. I was happy with the purchase. They are good quality for the price I paid and recommend these wine glasses as a gift or for your home."
3,Okay,"I think it's great that Khalid Duran made the attempt to reach out to Jews. However most of the book doesn't really deal with Jewish/Muslim relationship.(there's a chapter about that.) He also skips around alot. One minute he's discussing something that happened in the year 700 and the next he'll be mentioning Ayatollah Khomeini. I was thinking that he would write about similiarities in the Torah/Quran, go in depth about Jewish/Muslim relations in the medieval ages, etc. Most of thebook is a general history of Islam.(the Muslim empires, etc.)There's also some chapters that discuss what Islam is all about, etc."
1,Bias and Unscholarly,"The pathetic attempts to even suggest that he showed any balance in his views are nothing to note here. This extremely bias book goes against all principles of scholarship, as it contains very baseless theories. This man has an agenda and his work is in no way to be read to gather information, it is rather for those who wish to affirm their own misconceptions and weak conclusions. There is nothing stable about promoting absurd methodologies."
2,good as a supplement to kaplan's gre psych review,"This book was a disappointment, especially since it's coming from Princeton Review. I took someone else's advice and studied from the Kaplan GRE Psych Review. Kaplan is MUCH better. After making my own personal condensed study guide of all the terms reviewed in Kaplan, I then went to the Princeton Review book. Princeton Review had way less than Kaplan, and they also missed out on really important topics. For example, the cognitive psych chapter is only 4 pages long and includes problem-solving (i.e. definitions for schema, scripts, etc.), information-processing (i.e. semantic model), and emotion. Meanwhile, the Kaplan book goes into all the types of memory, people associated with terms, intelligence, language-- a better representative of my cognitive psych class.I'm glad I didn't waste too much time on Princeton Review."
2,"Not bad, not great....","As other reviewers have stated, this is a good book for a broad, superficial review, however, the cognitive, experimental, and diagnostic sections are not sufficient prep for the GRE exam - they are too basic and brisk and do not reflect what is actually on the exam. I got a 730, but I did so by looking at the Kaplan book (despite its mistakes galore) but most importantly reviewing my old textbooks. It's a challenging exam, but with good preparation you can beat it. Good luck!"
3,Overview of Psychology GRE,"I'm major in psychology during the graduate and postgraduate study. so that psychology GRE seems a big problem for me. I just read a Essentials of Psychology> edit by Dennis Cone( about 800 pages)--that's an interesting book even just for reading. then I took the psychology GRE free test preparation book. I found most of the questions in the test could be found in Dennis's Psychology book, anyhow, it's 800 pages:)Best wishes for those taking the test."
1,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a stool I could lean on as I stand a lot during the day, but this was a stool I could only sit on. I couldn't get it to tilt forward at all. And the seat is very uncomfortable. I sat on it for about 10 minutes and couldn't take it any more. It was easy to assemble. Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy and the return shipping was reasonable (under 20 dollars)."
4,works well for me,"I wanted an alternative to a drafting stool that would allow me to be up high, yet still keep my feet on the ground. This stool allows you to do that because of the forward tilt of the seat. The top most position is somewhere between sitting and standing, which is great if you're doing something more active than typing. I think it's really perfect for any activity where you might be up higher working on a bench or high table and don't feel like standing all the time. The only negative is that the low setting is just a tad high for my office desk with a keyboard tray underneath. The tray makes slight contact with the top of my legs, but it's still ok for a change from my standard office chair from time to time."
5,Just what I needed,"A great chair that suits my needs as I now stand at my desk while working. Every once in a while I needed a break and began researching chairs. I settled on this one for price,functionality and the fact that it fits nicely under my desk (and out of the way) when I stand at my desk. I was a little concerned about the chair sliding on the casters but thats not the case. The chair also comes with ""Feet"" so that you can switch from the casters to the ""feet"" in case your floor slants. I dont sit down much but when I do, its somewhat comfortable. I cant say that I would want to sit in it for hours on end, but it suits my needs."
2,"Hard as a rock- not for office use, and maybe not for a painter either","I bought this as a cheaper ""starter"" to try out the concept before buying a saddle chair. Verdict: Not for office use. The seat is as hard as a rock! Truthfully, I don't know how a painter could stand it either.I suppose you could rig up some sort of foam cushion for the seat or something, but otherwise, you're going to have one sore tushy. Also note, you're unlikely to be happy with it if you're less than 5'5"" tall.I'll keep this short, but some of the other low-star reviews have valuable additional details and merit reading before purchase. Mine's at the Goodwill."
1,easy to put together and adjust,"I put it together in less than 15 minutes and loved the optional glider or caster feet.I've only been sitting on it for about an hour but it's great so far. I'll update again after I've used it a few days.UPDATE: 2/27I've used it many hours a day for many days now and I love it. It's very comfortable, most of my sciatic and back problems have dissipated and thankfully there wasn't too much muscle tiredness from adjusting my posture.My only complaint is that you must REALLY tighten the tilt knob if you don't want it tilting back and forth on you.Otherwise, A+.Update 8/27Today I noticed a split in the seat cushion and I haven't use this chair much. I put out my back and couldn't use it for months, so here I am 160 pounds and I've broken the chair?Update 2/18The only thing keeping this chair usable is a ton of gaffer tape holding it together. Ordering a new chair asap."
3,average computer speakers,"The sound quality from these speakers is average at best. Equal to the sound quality from most laptop speakers. My only complaint is the muddy sound quality at the lower ends and hollow sound at the higher frequencies. Using equalizers does little to improve sound clarity. A deal at $10 from woot, but not by much."
2,"Nice looks, horrible sound.","I bought these for my computer at work, and while they look nice, they have very bad sound quality to them. The only controls on them is a volume control. Out of the box they have no bass sound what so ever. I have tried using the bass / treble control on my computer and can not get anything good out of them after trying several different settings. it just gets distorted and choppy instead of producing bass.I suppose if you use them for only windows type sounds and alerts it would be acceptable, but for music or the occasional youtube video, I would steer clear of these."
3,Too many and too much,"I enjoyed the first book of the trilogy. The second was not as good. The third - and this appears to be just me - was tiresome. I think I had had enough with the characters. I liked the first characters (book 1) and their stories during the war, but as the generations moved on, I lost interest. I kept having to remind myself which relation was Izzie and which Jenna, and then Maude.... I will say that I enjoyed reading and learning about the publishing industry. If you enjoy soap opera style novels, you will enjoy this. Everything that can happen, happens in this book..."
5,Trilogy,"This is the second book in a trilogy, I have enjoyed these books immensely. Penny Vincenzi does not disappoint. There is a lot of story to sink your teeth in, great reading."
3,Tuna sandwiches and tomato soup - pleasant but uninspired,"Other reviewers here have given a good feel for the setting and plot of this lightweight mystery about a small town housewife/mom who dabbles in crimesolving. I found it pleasant, but uninspired- one scene has her serving tuna sandwiches and tomato soup to her family, which kind of sums up the diet we're offered - lacking in imaginative ddetail, witty dialogue, or unususal characters - everyone and every conversation is mundane to the extreme, yet is oddly comforting in its familiarity."
5,Christmas Cookie Murder,"These stories are always enjoyable and fun to read....""comfort food"" reading. I've read so many that I am quite familiar with the characters....a relaxing read."
1,Missing Morals,"Sorry, I won't be reading any more of these books. Apparently it's ok for fireman to steal, (because that's the way it's done in small towns, the book says) and she actually covers for her kid when she catches him smoking pot. Her kids are self centered, annoying brats, and her husband doesn't seem to be around much. Throw in a case of breast cancer, and the murder of a young girl, and you have one really depressing creepy holiday book. The book is far to preachy about giving people a break, to enjoy. Somehow I think if Lucy's house had been on fire and fireman stole thousands from her, it wouldn't be ok. I resent the suggestion that theft is the way it's done in small towns, since I have several family members who are volunteer fireman, who wouldn't even consider doing something like that. This book ended up to be a chore to finish.I'll stick to Joann Fluke's Hanna Swenson series from now on, they're fun books and have recipes in them to boot."
3,"It was okay, but had some plot holes","It was okay, but I was outraged by the description of the daycare in the book. If that was a centre here it would be shut down for gross unprofessionalism! But the book was fine otherwise. Not spectacular, but fine.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"This book, like the others in this series that I have read, can hardly be termed ""murder mysteries."" The protagonist, Lucy Stone, never seem to solve the crimes. Instead, she accidnetly blunders into trouble and the murderer then promptly attacks or kidnaps her.Like may readers, a book is as escape for me into another world. Lucy Stone's world is one I do not intend to visit again. Her harried supermom performance, coupled with an inability to say no, makes her such a victim that I end up rooting for the bad guys. Her children are lazy brats who manage to get into all sorts of trouble. Her husband is insecure and selfish. Her friends think nothing of imposing on her. If reading this book is a ""break,"" it's a painful one.Save your money."
1,Magic and the Millenium,"I have yet to receive this item. I have written to the seller three times and to once to Amazon indicating this. When one orders at Amazon, I would think it's because they want the product as soon as possible. I am disappointed with this delay and failure to deliver. I will be glad to have my money back if the product cannot be delivered."
5,smart purchase,i find these to be a great benefit to me. they help control the swelling of my ankles due to surgery.i recommend these . they may not help everybody but they sure helped me.
4,Relief at last,"I'm recovering from DVT and have a lot of trouble getting American size clothing in Japan. The medical supply companies here have only S & M sizes and only white with open toes. Since everybody goes without shoes indoors, I had two problems. This is the second order of these socks I've gotten from Amazon. Repeat spells satisfaction for me. 4 stars? They pick up too much lint from the floors (no shoes, remember?) Also, I'd like a heavier weight for the cold winters here. Wooden floors, no shoes, no central heating in classrooms. How about that price? Size apart, the price of the socks and international postage is still cheaper."
4,Great support hose,"My ankles and lower legs need some help when I do a lot of walking or am on my feet for extended periods of time. Also, when I wear dress clothes, I cannot wear the ankle support worn with jeans. The Futuro Support Socks help a lot in all cases. In addition I have found them to be far more durable than expected. It takes a bit of effort to put them on and take them off. So far no damage to the socks."
2,Not that great,I bought these for my dad but they didn't last long before falling apart. He ended up buying compression socks at Rite Aid for $5.00 per pair and they are better quality and more comfortable.
2,Support socks,The support socks are really thin and leaves me wondering what happened since I last purchased these. They were a lot heavier last year and I wonder how these will hold up!
1,False advertising,"The description clearly states that you are offering a pack of two one-pair boxes of stockings. When I have ordered these in previous years, I have received two one-pair boxes of stockings, shrink-wrapped together. This order was for two one-pair boxes of black stockings, but this time I only received one one-pair box. When I called the vendor to complain, they said that the description meant that there were two stockings in the box (which equals one pair, hence Pack of 2). They said that it was Amazon's fault for the incorrect description of the item. Ironically, I also bought identical Navy blue stockings from another vendor who advertised their stockings as one-pair box and that is exactly what they ship. I chose to order the black stockings from this vendor, because it appeared to be a bargain."
2,Did not get what I ordered,I order the socks . I should have gotten pack of 2 . But I received 1 pair pack of 1 . The ad is vary misleading . I did not get what I wanted . Did not get what I ordered . Kind of a shame .
2,Tries too hard,"This support sock tries too hard to be a complete solution to swollen legs. Futuro just does not need to work so hard to be the perfect, snug and (here's the rub) perhaps too firm support."
5,This one gets four paws up!,"My daughter received this as a present for her third birthday. I love it as much as she does. It will touch your heart and remind you that home and family are worth giving your all for, as Corduroy and Lisa do. Grab this book and your child, niece, nephew, or friend's son or daughter, and read this to them. You'll both be better for the experience."
2,Beware the Board Book Edition!,"The bear-shaped board book ""edition"" is NOT the Corduroy story. It shouldn't even be listed as the same book. The original story is cute and poignant, and I highly recommend it. But the board book has no real narrative; it is just a list of things that Corduroy does one day. There are no other characters, no dialogue, no conflict or issues, no rhyming, nothing but ""Corduroy is mailing some letters."" and ""Corduroy takes a bath. Look at all the bubbles."" The illustrations, while nice, aren't original -- they were culled from other Corduroy books.The book is cute enough, and my 17-month old daugther loves it because it's oversized and bear-shaped. But I was disappointed not to get the actual Corduroy story, and would not have bought it if I'd known what it was. All that said, if your child already knows and likes the original Corduroy book, this might be a nice companion."
2,Board book version is disappointing...,"This book is basically a primer about the bear; there's no story to speak of and the little African American girl is not in the book at all. I bought this book because I was looking for a more durable version of the original Corduroy for my toddler. I am seriously thinking about returning this as I was looking to add to our library of children's books featuring African American characters. Bottom line: this is a completely different book than the original Corduroy. Don't be fooled like I was.That having been said...it probably is a pretty good ""learn to read"" book, the pages are nice and big and the illustrations are cute."
3,Ok,"Everyone loves Corduroy, a great classic book! My grandbaby loves it! These are books my kids used to have and loved!"
5,Shape Book,This is a good book to have. I would recommend other teachers to get it. It will help children learn their shapes. The size is highly recommended too.
4,UNWRAPPED vol 4,"I have Vol 1,2,3 and 4 of UNWRAPPED. Their music is truly an art form. And deserves much respect . They have brought a smorgastboard of mix original tunes and combined their flavor to them that is worth every bit you spent on it, and then some. Hope we hear something REALLY SO!!!!! Hope they would give at least one more shout out to Marvin Gaye and put a spin on his original ""STUBBORN KIND OF FELLOW."" Disappointment will NEVER enter you mind!!!!!!!"
4,"Fits CS9 like a glove, but is wobbly on the body.","I have been carrying my S&W; CS9 semiauto in a IWB holster but wanted something a little more comfortable for daily wear. This holster is well made and fits my gun like a glove, however it is not a great concealed holster. The butt of the gun sticks too far out from the hip, and it bounces too much when walking. It would be good for a standing/sitting or around the house carry when concealment isn't an issue, as it is very comfortable.I'm debating on returning it and trying something else."
2,WHAT TO DO BEFORE BUYING SOMETHING? ESPECIALLY ELECTRONICS DIVICES...,"What I do first of all, is to read about the product that I want to buy on Relatives Magazines or Internet sites. There, you can learn from the especialist, usually who speak because of the industry pay him, but not always.But, what you shouldn't never do is: Don't read about the owner's opinions, because, we don't receive paid from anybody, sometimes could be, because, everything is possible, but your instinct will show it to you, even though, not always.Por eso es que opino que el articulo anterior me ayudo. Asi aclaro mi punto de vista sobre ciertas garantias, los que trabajamos para compañias de telecomunicaciones, sabemos como funciona esto...Be careful!"
3,They're only 11-25 cents each folks.,"Don't waste you're money buying this case folks... it adds up to over 33 cents a package. You can buy them idividually at Amazon for only 25 cents, & many online & local stores are selling them for 11 cents each."
4,Lanceogrophy,"I am still a big fan of Lance and thought the DVD offered some interesting insights to his life and what makes him so driven. However, most of the information can be found in several other films."
3,mediocre,"This small book about solar arcs is interesting, especially if you are a beginning or intermediant astrologer. It will not appeal to experienced astrologers who will be better off with the book of Noel Tyl. In fact this book is rather an introduction to solar arc directions, a step-by-step guide on what solar arcs are and how to interpret them. If you look for a good book about solar arcs, just stick to Noel Tyl's book."
4,Good on clarity and great on originalilty,"The thrust of Ms. Devine's book is aimed toward the astrological student and not the seasoned professional. If you do charts for a living then solar ars are not new to you. But what IS of interest to both the celestial novice and the experienced star sage is her original discovery of life in reverse after 45. This masterful insight supplies a heretofore unavailable depth and understanding. Regardless of your expertise level in astrology, there are gems to be mined from this book."
5,very tight cd,"when i got this cd i wasn't really expecting much due to the fact it only had one review on amazon and i kinda just got it on impact but when i heard it I was very surprised. i love this guys flow, its so vivid and i can really get into it. i can also really understand what the guy is saying.the lyrics are very intelligent and thoughtful and the beats are just fun to listen to. this guys dj is really good with the scratching and what not. its a fun listen.highly recomended"
4,"Not quite as good as ""Take Me to Your Leader""","In comparison to their newest cd ""Take Me to Your Leader"" (which knocked my socks off by the way), it's a little disappointing. I attribute this to them producing this cd themselves, while the newer cd was produced by an actual producer for Strange Music. There's a big difference. That being said, ""Take Me to Your Leader"" is nearly impossible to measure up to and this group's talent still shines through on ""Mayday!"", and boy do they have a lot of it. Some songs are repetitive and lack production value, but there are still more good songs than bad. It may take a few listens, but this album is worth getting."
3,effective indie horror film.,"the insert in the dvd case has an essay written by the director of the film. He talks about the making of the movie and other details. He made this film for $3,000. I liked the location shoot and the lighting of the film.Given the budget, this was an effective horror movie. It has several colorful characters. The plot concerns a couple who go to a couples retreat cabin resort in a remote wooded area. They plan to relax and reignite the romance in their relationship. Instead, they stumble upon a haunted area whose spirit has come back from the dead to get revenge upon the inhabitants of the area.* recommended for horror fans."
2,blood and sex nightmare a nightmare,"This is the kind of movie you expect from a direct to video dvd.The characters are 1 dimensional and the plot has been done zillions of times before.There is enough nudity which can be expected as per the title.I actually bought this dvd because i am a tina kraus fan and she has a good 10 minute episode in the dvd but the plot and characters are stick figures to get slaughtered and that sums up the dvd,boring"
4,Can grow with your child..,"My now 3 year old daughter has a lot of fun with this game and requests it often. WE make it fun for her..we put out all the cards & I figure out which of the colored animals is missing...I then say i.e "" Red Elephant- the red elephant is missing!"" My husband & daughter then race to see who can slap the red elephant first..she beats him fair & square most of the time. :) When she is older it can grow to her capablities as I won't yell out which one is missing..whoever figures it out first will find the card first. This is how the directions say to play it-I don't know many 2-3 year olds who could do that enjoyably. I would have given it 5 stars if the cards had more colorful backing & rounded corners."
5,"great band, great CD. BUY IT!!","I saw Lola Ray play in LaCrosse On May 8th with Allister, Split Habit, and Punchline and they were insane. John Balicanta (lead vocalist) is one of the most amazing live performers I have ever seen. The energy he gives off on stage is indescribable. I met the guys after the show in the merch area and they're all awesome. I think the only good thing about GC signing them to DC Flag is that now they'll get the publicity they deserve (hopefully). BUY THIS CD!! You won't be disappointed."
5,Get it,"I saw these guys in concert on May 8th at the LaCrosse show. The set they played was absolutely the best out of any of the bands that night including the headlining Allister. It was really too bad that since Allister played last a large part of the audience didnt show up until later. The band is composed of John Balicanta: vocals/guitar, Brian Spina: guitar, James McIvor: bass, and Alex Smolinski: drums. This is probably one of the best new records i've heard in a while. Any one who knows a thing or two about punk rock is going to be disappointed that Lola Ray has signed with Good Charlotte's DC Flag Records, but they've gotta get out some how and the cd is really worth buying."
4,LoLaRaY,"Okay, so this Cd is awesome, one of there best songs is Automatic Girl, i really like the beat of this song and the lyrics are awesome! Another good song is Charlit Movie Star, its kinda a slower song but still awesome, the day after i heard those two songs i went out and bought the Cd."
5,Awesome!!!!,"This band is really awesome! I've never seen them live, but I'm absolutely dying to!! Become a fan. You won't regret it. THEY WILL BE FAMOUS. We're talking mainstream here. I don't want MTV to get to their head, though. :POh, and BTW, totally check out their site. You can listen to three of their songs, full-length.Even though this is in most of the other reviews, I'll say it anyway: they're a genre all their own."
1,Product Returned..no thanks,"We were looking forward to using this as our mainkitchen phone...it had many features for few bucks. Instead, ithad to be returned. We could not call out on it and incomingcalls were very faint, almost imposssible to hear. I was trulydisappointed as it is so difficult to find a good landline phonenowadays. Test it out carefully once you receive it. Don't let itsit idle in the box."
3,good basic phone,"I needed a good basic phone, to go with my wireless phones in my home. It works well for that. A good solid base that is not flimsy."
2,disappointed in seller,I wanted to cancel this order when it became apparent it could not be combined with my other order. I did not want to pay multiple shipping fees. I recieved a message to late order pulled and in shipping process. This was all done on a Sunday and the order was not shipped until the following Tuesday. Sad way to do business that no one is availble to stop this order days before it shipped.Stephen
2,Never really worked right...,"Makes calls, receives calls...BUT LED comes and goes randomly (supposed to flash to indicate new calls); LCD display comes and goes; and does not reliably save calls in list. Mine must have an electronics problem."
2,Serviceable and simple but blinking light is crazy,"The only thing wrong with this otherwise perfectly simple phone is the blinking red light that uselessly informs you that someone, sometime, in the indefinite past, called you. I've got an answering service to tell me that!So you get this red light on top of the phone that blinks forever and never stops, regardless of whether you have a message waiting or not--and there's no way to permanently turn off that blinking light. You can delete the 'memory' of the last calls--one at a time!--but the next time someone calls, BAM! There goes the blinking red light again. Very annoying if the phone is bedside. And putting a piece of tape over the phone rather defeats the aesthetics of the thing, don't ya think?"
3,OK for the price,Installation a snap. Sound OK. Only problem is pressing the flash button when cradling handset between shoulder and ear. Display could be a little brighter.
3,glad this isn't my main phone,"what can i say? i am home sick so decided to order my ""in case of emergencies land line"" online. the phone is slim and stays out of the way, and for all intensive purposes works...somewhat. you have to play with the cords so there isn't a constant static. whomever calls you can hear you just fine, however, you will endure sporatic static on your end. the caller id works just fine, and like most individual units, blinks when you have a new call. the ease of use for setup and everyday function make this phone user friendly."
3,Too Bulky,The phone is slim but a lot higher than the normal phone and doesn't look quite right when wall mounted since it sits so far from wall. I ended up buying another phone and using this one for the basement.
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered 2 of these phones because I am having trouble finding this type phone in any local store. Needless to say - neither of the phones worked. On one phone the mouthpiece did not work. On the other, the handset had buttons that did not work at all.So I returned both of the phones."
4,"Good basic phone, maybe not so good for wall","I've had a white trimline-style phone on my kitchen wall for many, many years and finally got tired of trying to clean it. So I hopped online and looked for a replacement. I wanted Caller-Id but didn't want to spend a fortune so this phone seemed to fit the bill.Now that we've had it for a couple of weeks, I'd say it works fine as a phone and haven't had any Caller-Id problems. The only thing is it's kind of ""thick"" for a wallphone, and sticks out from the wall more than my last phone did. Also the hook that holds the receive in place is a bit flimsy and you have to be careful when you hang it up. If you plan to hang this on the wall and have little kids or pets or clumsy husbands who will run into it, be prepared for the receiver to get knocked off a lot. Other than that it's perfect for the price."
3,Not lighted,Phone is fine. It is very easy to program. Display is not lighted; keypad is not lighted.
4,Does the Job.,This phone mounts well on our kitchen wall and works fine. Only negative so far is that the hook that keeps the phone handset connected to the base seems pretty cheap.
1,Worked for a few months only,"I bought this phone because I wanted something simple and corded. This phone worked great for the first few months, then the caller ID stopped working and now when I call someone or they call me they can barely hear me (although I hear them ok). The sound quality is very poor and I need to get this phone replaced. A waste of money!"
5,Captures your imagination from the very first map,"Don't skip the prologue, but understand that the second illustration past the prologue is a fabulous map. It looks as though the map will be for reference for the entire story... but the map is prologue. The story happens after the map.This book is not just for children. It will interest readers of every age who like a mystery. Outstanding art from Peter Sis -- he never disappoints."
4,So comfortable!,I strap this to my computer chair at home and work while getting a back massage. You could adjust it on the chair for your neck as well but I find that using this for a neck massage is best when lying down. Its so comfortable that i feel like falling asleep whenever i use it for a neck massage. The product looks great too!
4,Massages neck well,This is a great massager for the neck. It says back also but I have no clue how this thing can possible massage your back. Get this for your neck pain ONLY!!
5,Thank you,"As a convert I at the beginning to Vatican II. Alot was left out or ""Oh we will discuss this when the dust settles"". RCIA classes have been a great help. But... This book has been a Godsend.. It not only covers the Real Presence... but it includes the history and the theology and the Whys.......... If you are searching for a better understanding of this subject in the Catholic Faith I recommend this book very highly. It is also written so the average person can understand what they are talking about. It also goes into how history has caused deeper explantions and the true ""WHY"". It also dicusses how in defending the dogema we confirm a deeper belief. So again I say Thank You. DOC"
5,Great Book,My 2 year old daughter loves this book! She is so into animals. It is very cute and sturdy! The size of it is also great.
5,Balanced apprisal,"He presents a criticism of Bush's justification for invasion of Iraq, but then offers other arguments based on national security that could have been used. He makes many criticisms of Bush's failure to manage the results of the invasion, but then gives a very realistic evaluation of what is needed now. A very balanced appraisal. A very good tie in to his book, God and Gold."
5,"Great, simple and easy to follow -thank you!",This book goes through everything. It's great to use. I've sewed before and teach sewing to students. I can't believe someone finally sat down and explained everything so clearly with words and pictures. It's great for beginers- it goes over everything- from holding scissors properly (yes there is a right way) to explaining fabric and grain and getting people to sew without fearing it.I would recommend this book for any beginer and any intermediate sewer out there- and the patterns in the back are terrific projects to get you going.
4,A Great Beginner's Guide,"This book is a great way to learn about sewing! It has great info about different fabrics, how to properly fold and cut material, how to take measurements, how to read a pattern, how to make alterations... A great over-all guide! I bought it for a friend who is just a beginner, but even though I've been sewing for years I learned new things (or refreshed my memory) by browsing through it."
3,get it from the library first,"This book is ""Ok"", and probably rates about 3.5 stars. I checked it out from the library, and I'm glad that I did. While it is a good book for teaching general information about sewing, I honestly think that once you read it, you won't need to keep it around. The patterns are really pretty cheesy, and very dated. There are only renditions of the items, and no photos of a completed project. They are very basic, and good for beginners with clear instructions, but you can find really CUTE beginner patterns out there without wasting time on something that you won't use, just for the sake of practice."
2,I sent this book back,I was very disappointed in this book and sent it back to Amazon. It was way too basic and I am a beginner! I am trying to find a good reference and this was not it...
3,Good for a beginner.,"This is a good book for a beginner if you have no previous sewing skills and would like to get a jump start on sewing.The best part is that it comes with 3 patterns and directions for sewing them.This is mostly what the book is about.There is a section at the front about tools and fabric and also the basic parts of the sewing machine,but most of the book is directions for using the patterns included.I guess that's what all beginners need to get right in there and start sewing something/anything to get your feet wet.I really liked this book and the patterns are cute, they include an envelope pillow cover,a tote bag and a skirt.Good book"
2,No real photographs,"I'm new to sewing and bought this book based on the reviews. The problem with this book is that there's no real photographs of the finished product. As a novice, a real picture of the end result would help to understand what I am making."
2,"So-So Projects, Short on Details","This was the first book that I owned as a beginning sewer. I made the throw pillows twice and was surprised at how small they were. I would need two on each end of the couch to achieve a balanced look.I thought that the instructions could have been more detailed - I had trouble applying the piping to the pillow based on the illustrations provided.Of all the sewing books I've purchased since ""Sew Fast, Sew Easy,"" I'd say that this one is one that I regret the most. I recommend S.E.W. Everything Workshop by Diana Rupp. It contains better instructions, more projects and more general information about sewing."
4,Very entertaining,I found this book to be very entertaining. I am reading it for the second time. I always find something I missed from the original reading.
5,Pleased with this toy,"Quite honestly, my kids don't use this a lot, but I'm still happy I bought it. Sometimes when they ask me a mathematics question, I get this out to help illustrate. I like it that it has 5 each of 2 colors per bar, which was a feature not found in other abaci. It's a great tool to have around. Since I bought it when they were young, I feel we'll get more use out of it over the years. I imagine we'll start pulling it out more as they go through more math in school."
2,FOrgive the Author he knows not what to do,"After puchasing volumes 1-6 as a group and testing some of the circuits I spent many hours correcting the mistakes and errors in these circuits. I threw the books into the closet and designed from scratch my own circuits, it took far less time and they work when I'm done. I wish you could hold the authors accountable for lost time I could hire a design staff larger than Microsoft."
2,One Step Above Paperweight or Doorstop,I already had Vol 1. of this series from decades ago. I thought the author had maybe improved the content and accuracy of his books. Sadly mistaken. Schematic diagrams are routinely missing values for parts or lacking important information. I have been in electronics for several decades and I again am greatly disappointed with lack of quality. I don't know if the author received permission to reprint these circuits on the condition he left out part values or what. For the money your better off somewhere else. Large voume of circuits diminished by poor quality of information.
1,Road Warrior LiIon Slim Battery for Motorola StarTac Phone,"This battery DOES NOT WORK with my Motorola digital StarTac wireless telephone (ST7760). The manufacturer (iGo Corporation) says that even though its batteries are made to Motorola's specifications, they do not always work with the intended phone. He suggested I purchase a Motorola battery for my Motorola phone."
1,"dry, out-of-date guide","I picked up a second-hand copy of this book although useful for checking dates of films, directors etc I found it quite dry in tone and now very outdated. I found better books on amazon on this subject of gay and lesbian cinema.101 Must See Gay Movies is quite good but the best overall guide and history of gay cinema as a genre is ""Out at the Movies"" by Steven Paul Davies. Much more of an authoritative guide, it is beautifully produced too, from the full cover gloss cover to the many full-colour pictures included throughout. Olson's book has no pics, tiny reviews and tries to cram everything in, anything gay or lesbian, even the most obscure entries you could imagine.The 'story' of gay cinema plus more detailed reviews of individual films is told better, and decade by decade, in Out at the Movies. Plus Davies' book is an easy read, well researched, informative and revealing. I hope this is useful for anyone out there needing texts on this subject."
5,L-O-V-E it !!!!!!,"When you live in a tiny nyc apartment with 350 sqft, there is no other option. Form follows function here. It has comfortable grip handles and is easy to operate, not to mention it's got a slick design. My only complaint is that I didn't buy them earlier!"
4,Go For a Heavier Set,I bought these not knowing the most the dumbbells go up to is 20 lbs each.That's hardly enough to use. I would buy the heavier set if you actually want to get something out of the workout.
4,user friendly design,The holding trays are essential so that one does not have weights rolling around the room. I can keep these dumbbells atop my bureau thanks to the tray. Having different weights adjustable on just one pair of dumbbells is perfect even if space is not limited.
2,Doesn't work.,"My coworker gave this to me, to try on my puppy. He keeps chewing on the bed frame, my shoes, etc. My coworker forewarned me that it didn't have any effect on her dogs. But, I thought I would give it a try on my puppy. I sprayed it on the bed frame and the underneath area that he chews on. When it was wet, he made a face like he tasted something nasty so I thought it had worked. But, after a bit he was back at it chewing away not even considered of the taste. Then, my boyfriend was playing with the puppy and managed to get that taste in his mouth from the puppys fur. Well...it worked for him...but not the puppy..."
1,DOES NOT WORK!,I used Bitter Apple before and it worked. I ran out and went back to the store to buy some more but saw that Bitter End was cheaper. It smells like mace to me when I spray it. But my dog loves it! He used to chew his pea pads and that's why I got Bitter Apple. He completely stopped. Now that I'm using Bitter End he is not only chewing his pea pads....but he is eating and swallowing them! OMG! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT DOES NOT WORK!
1,DIDNT WORK FOR US,I bought this item because i have two puppies that play rough and the lady at the pet store told me to try spraying this on there coats and it should stop them from biting each other. but it only made the fights worse. The puppies acted like they where mad that the other one tasted so bad. so this product wasnt good for us
2,Moderate to heavy reading even for a die hard Lou Reed fan.,"I suppose as a book of reference this one works, as far as reading for enjoyment, I'd rather stick a hot poker in my ass. Hopefully, Transformer is better. I imagine it can be difficult puting someones life in an understandable order, especially a up and down guy like Reed, but I fell away in the attempt to follow."
5,one of his best,"This is the first novel I acquired for my Kindle. Timothy Gedge is a fabulous creation of William Trevor. Gedge is one of literature's most evil and horrible young people, yet deserving of some pity, all the same. The seaside town is wonderfully described and Trevor's typical interest in the foibles of his characters makes this a superb read - a novel I have read in one form or another about 6 times, at last count. If only for the scene where Timothy is plied with sherry and ale, to the horror of his host's wife, this book is a true classic. It may be my favourite novel - up there with the novels of John Cheever."
2,ok for everyday dining,I got this set as I thought it looked like a great color. I was very pleased with them for the first 6 weeks but now they seem to have a film on them where they look like they have not been washed properly. Would not recommend based on that!
4,Great dishes! Great color!,Can't say enough about how happy we are with these! The color is not too red so you don't feel like they're xmas dishes or valentine's day dishes only.The backs are a little rough which is good when washing they don't go flying out of your hands. The first couple times after washing I did notice marks on them but a little extra soap seems to have done away with that. Waiting for the next sale to buy an extra set! Since we just got them afraid of giving them a full 5 stars. Hoping they'll deserve an update to that rating in a couple months.
4,wash redskins denver broncs highlights,"I was stationed in Germany when the game was played. Even though the highlights are in standard definition,I enjoyed them. Glad to have one of the best comeback games ever played. One of the best super bowls ever.Thanks to the seller for being prompt on the delivery."
5,Flawless,Installed in Windows XP in minutes and found my wireless router right away. Works flawlessly.
2,What a frustration!,"The Hippocrene dictionary was the first Estonian-English/English-Estonian dictionary that I bought. I was continually frustrated by the absence I words which I wanted to check, in both Estonian and English. The TEA pocket dictionary, published by TEA Kirjastus in Tallinn is much more reliable. Now that I have a copy, I can't even remember where I have abandoned the Hippocrene dictionary.The TEA dictionary is not available yet through Amazon. You'll find it only if you go to TEA's Estonian website and register as a user.OK, Amazon, stock the TEA publications! They are very good!"
3,I expected more,"Before bought this book I had acquired another book, a Text-book (""Estonian Textbook"" by Juhan Tuldava), it has a 'little' dictionary at the end of it's pages showing the words in the nominative, genitive, partitive and partitive plural cases all at ones. The 'Estonian dictionary & Phrasebook' only shows the main word (nominative) and is smaller than the 'little' dictionary in the back of the other Text-book. This disappointed me because I bought it mainly for the dictionary.The phrasebook part is useful if you want to learn the most common things, but if you want to spend time learning real Estonian, I recommend you this extremely useful Text-book of Juhan Tuldava."
1,Estonian-English Dictionary - Unseen,"I am sure this dictionary is fine, but I have not received it yet- a month after ordering it! In the meantime I have been on holiday to Estonia and have been back a week as well!Come on Amazon we expect better service than this from you."
3,Lady in Waiting,"I finished it and enjoyed the ending, but found it entirely too ""wordy"". the characters were good and the plot interesting, but too long and drawn out!"
3,Interesting,"This book was a interesting look at the intrigue and plots that abound at court in another time. I found it to be a good read. It was a story of greed, scoundrels, and the wims of the Queen putting people in situations for her own amusement. I found it to be an interesting read."
3,Read it when you have plenty of time to kill!,"I like love stories in general and this is a good book except it was kinda difficult to understand but after a while I got used to it. It's not the best, but I did enjoyed the book."
3,Very nice,"Leaves my skin soft and nearly flawless. At first I wasn't so sure about it, but after wearing it for a few hours, I was sold. It's very breathable.Update: Not very long lasting, but still a nice foundation. Not worth the price though."
5,THE BEST,"This foundation is the best, and I've tried them all. Also, it doesn't look like much can be in that pouch, but I bought mine 8 months ago, use it every day, and there's still plenty left. Never had foundation last that long."
2,Three Homes.... come on...,The First Show.. The best of them all had about 6 homes on tour.I see no reason in getting this DVD because its only 3 homes and the curators/historians and same photos/ Videos are on the first DVD. Just a different host reading the same dialog. Why see the same thing twice?waste of time. (been there done that)Its just my opinionIf you haven't seen the first one.This one is ok...
2,Not approved by Vatican because of inclusive language,"I was given a copy of NAB by a friend and did read some chapters. Like the reader above, I got to ""Hail favour one"" which is quiet different from what I remember from reading another bible as well as the rosary. To me, it is not the same as ""Full of grace."" This is but one instance. The commentary left me in doubt at times. Well I did a google search and found that a few years back NAB got rejected by our beloved father (Pope John Paul) because of inclusive language. Do a google search for Richard John Neuhaus and NAB for a review. Any other book and I would compromise but not the bible (the word of God). So after some due searching as well as looking at EWTN review I think I am looking towards the Navare or Ignatius. Hope that helps."
3,MY REVIEW,WHAT I SAW OF THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY FUNNY. I ORDERED THIS MOVIE FOR MY AUNT BECAUSE SHE WAS LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THIS MOVIE. IT ARRIVED IN GOOD TIME AND NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE DVD. CONSIDERING IM ORDERING ALL MY MOVIES FROM AMAZON NOW I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH THE DVDS.
4,ban it!,This sort of book should be banned!It gives the wrong idea to extremists.Life is tough enough for the cattle industry in the mid-west right now (i should know) without this kind of book stirring up more trouble.Cattle in US are not vaccinated against FMD for a very good reason - the USDA is the best in the world at limiting its spread and preventing imports of anything that might endanger the food chain.
4,Has worked to improve bladder control,I have a 15 year old mini schnauzer with Cushings that caused wetting accidents and less bladder control. We tried Proin...scary drug...she ended up in the animal emergency clinic with hives from Proin...then I did research on Proin...it was taken off the market for humans due to how dangerous it is. Bladder Strength has helped but has not totally arrested the problem but has made it bearable to live with. Proin totally stopped the problem but could have killed my dog.
4,Bladder Control for Dogs,"I have a female Husky, German Shepard/Collie mix. She just turned 13 yrs old this past May and was beginning to spot my floors at times when getting up or laying down. I ordered this product and have been using it ever since. While it is not 100% fool-proof, it has worked very well to minimize the problem and it now occurs very infrequently. Thank god for such a great product!"
5,It works for us!,"Abbey is our 14 1/2 year old spayed Labrador Retriever. She has had bladder control issues for the last year or more of her life. We are against filling her body with drugs and dealing with their side effects so our vet suggested we try this product. It has worked very well for her and we see no side effects of any kind. She willing eats the Bladder Strength Tabs and even seems to like them. Any time we can avoid a drug, we try it. No need to keep experimenting, it works for us! She is about 74 pounds and we give her 2 tabs with the am feeding and 1 tab with the evening feeding."
1,Seemed to make the situation worse,Very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. Stopped using Bladder Strength Dog after only a week because my border collie's incontinence became worse instead of better. She went from having an accident in her sleep about once a week to having one every night. Switched her over to Homeopet Leaks No More (also sold on amazon) and so far it seems to be working. Fingers crossed the Leaks No MoreHomeoPet Leaks No More 15ml Bottle ( Multi-Pack)continues to control the problem.
1,Did not work for us,"We have a 9 year old Doberman who has been on Proin since the age of 2 for leaky bladder. After changing to this organic product (we heard it was potentially harmful to stay on Proin) we noticed she not only had small leaks, but full bladder emptying while she slept. Was not at all helpful for her."
3,"It seemed to work at first, but hasn't been working at all lately","I was hopeful, especially after early indications seemed to be that it was working. We're about halfway through the bottle and it just doesn't seem to be doing the trick anymore."
3,Works well,So far so good. I don't think it is quite as good as Proin but it is comparable & cheaper.
3,Not working for my dog,"I gave it three stars because I can't really say one way or another, it's not working for my dog and her incontinence. My dog has other probably neurological issues that are going-on so a supplement was perhaps not going to be effective anyway but it was worthwhile to try. I've given it to my dog for three weeks without improvement."
1,No Head Gaskets Included,"The set of gaskets we received had many gaskets in it, but there were NO head gaskets. Maybe this would be better described as Misc. Gasket Set."
1,Dont,"Have been a Gunsmoke fan from the start, if you like P/C then buy but if you are seeking the old charm, look elsewhere.Gary"
4,Gunsmoke Collection,"These movies in this collection have a lot of language, and a little more gore than we like. Not for children. However the plots were good, and this is classic James Arness and in the line with the caracter."
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this CD set given the high regard I have for Digweed's two-CD Bedrock compilation. This collection did not provide the dark, brooding mixes that I had hoped for. There are a couple of catchy tracks, but unfortunately this CD will likely begin gathering dust much sooner than I had hoped.Note: The tracks on these CDs are standalone tracks, not meshed into a continuous mix, FYI."
2,Probably not what you're looking for!,"If you are new to Oracle (and this book is obviously geared toward the new user) you might want to stay away from this book. The author does take a step-by-step approach to installing Oracle and creating databases, etc. but the steps are out of order (you're asked to grant users rights to tables that you have not yet created), code fragments are incorrect (table names change throughout examples) and there is very little ""meat"" to anything.In nearly every chapter the author suggest that you go to other documentation for further study. I suggest you bypass this book entirely and move on to something more substantive and accurate."
4,"Good basic book, with good perspective","This book is used as the textbook for the first level of the Coaching Accreditation Program for USA Volleyball. It has a good broad perspective on the game, how to motivate and how to teach the skills. It also goes the through season and practice planning and breaks down the process in a very basic manner, which I found very useful.A great beginning coach's book."

4,A Survivor's Story,"JD Mason's And on the Eighth Day She Rested is a moving, true to life tale that had me wondering: How much more can Ruth take? It didn't show life after abuse as peaches and cream, but it took a close look at the internal struggles that Ruth had to deal with after she left her abusive husband. Mason showed us that ""it ain't over till it's over""."
3,EMOTIONAL STORE,"THIS BOOK WAS A VERY, VERY GOOD READ WITH SOME REALLY GOOD LESSONS. RUTH WAS AN ABUSED WOMEN THAT FINALLY STOOD UP AND MOVED ON WITH HER LIFE, THIS STORY FOCUSES ON HER JOURNEY AND HER RELATIONSHIPS AFTER. VERY GOOD BOOK"
5,And on the 9th Day she found Joy.,"Absolute and total joy. This heartfelt story is about Ruth, a broken and abused woman who finally said ""Enough."" With the power of knowing there is no where else to go when you hit the bottom but up, she starts her climb out of the pit of hell and into the land of the unknown. "".. She Rested"" tells the tale of determination, friendship and finding real love. Until one day her world caves in again but this time, she fights for her life. Read this first novel by J.D. Mason to see what happens when you follow your heart, even when everything is taken from you, all over again."
4,Eye opener!,"This was a good book regarding abusive relationship. I have never been in abusive situation. But I have known people that have been. You always ask, ""Why do you stay?"" But after reading this book I finally got the answer. Eric just was a very awful man with problems within his self. Poor Ruth, she was just his punching bag. How can you claim you love someone and treat them badly like he did. Things he done was very uncalled for. Then when Ruth finally got out of the situation with Eric (husband), and finally got the nerve to meet someone, Adrian walks in here life, then out. I felt so sorry for Ruth, but Adrian had nerve. I understand he wanted to be a father to his child, but there are other ways to handle the sistuation. I think he was just being selfish there. I don't know if I could had forgiven Adrian and took him back or not. Something to think about. Get the book!"
4,She finally found a love of her own,And on the Eighth Day She Rested was a great read.Ruth went through so much in the 14 years she was married.It was so good when she finally woke up and left the abusive marriage.It was also good to see she finally found a love of her own.Adrian made me mad but I was glad when he came to his senses.A novel not to debate on getting .
4,Excellent book!!!!,"This was a great book. I finished it in 1 day. This book really empowered me. Although I'm not suffering physical abuse, I was kind of stuck in a rut. I recommend all ladies to read this book. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,triumphant.,"i like this. i like ruth, this book you will like it has a story to think about. i told all my girlfriends to pick this up. a women to difine "" i am somebody"" in simple words. im ready for the next."
4,'Just Us Girls' Book Review,"The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed this book in August '03. The group felt this was a good book! The main character, Ruth Johnson, demonstrates remarkable strength and growth as a product from an abusive relationship."
1,the sinking emergency room,This book is one of the worst books that I ever read and would never recomend it. The characters are un-real and the plot is week. It is a NEVER must read.
5,V.C. Andrews best series!,"I have read MANY of V.C. Andrews' books, and the Casteel family series is my absolute favorite! (Including the prequel Web of Dreams) This tale of incest, secrets, and lies, will keep you in thrall until the last page. And just when you begin withdrawls, you can pick up the next book. Andrews has a special way of unraveling a story, and keeping it exiting until the fifth book!"
3,Maybe the History but where is the Mystery?,"This is one of the better movies on China's History. It tells about China's very first up to present day. It gives imformation on the farmers, if it wasn't for them China wouldn't have grown to what it is now. One of the better parts is when they tell about the Emporer's Clay Army. Did you you know they where built to protect the emporer in the after life? This is a great movie for people who are just starting to learn about China.Thanks for your time, Zachary Wilson"
5,Life Changing Moments,"Jubilee Time speaks to me where I am right now, and welcomes me to continue into the rest of my life with joy, creativity and peaceful wisdom. Engaging this second half of my life is the adventure I have been waiting for, and this book makes those connections with myself and community tangible. Best investment for my future ever made."
4,Two great Spaghetti Westerns in one high quality package,"Spaghetti Westerns are what they are: Cult Cinema, Trash Cinema, however you want to categorize them. Within that context, this package puts two pretty good examples of the genre together.""Between God, The Devil & A Winchester"" stars Richard Harrison and Gilbert Roland, two solid stars of the genre, in a fun treasure hunt story.""Johnny Yuma"" is a fairly violent example of a Spaghetti Western, starring Mark Damon and sexy Rosalba Neri. This is a pretty entertaining film all in all.Wild East is a DVD company that puts out a lot of hard to find Eurowestern classics, and they are to be commended for putting out high quality widescreen versions, usually with extras. If you're a fan of the genre, check out other releases from Wild East, like ""Day Of Anger"", ""Kill And Pray"" and ""Sartana""."
5,Excellent Self-Help Book,"This book teaches a wonderful plan to set and accomplish specific, workable goals in a systematic, weekly timetable."
4,Gundam MSIA providence gundam,"this is a good figure. little paint slop. construction is durable. shoulder binders could be a little better engineered so they dont fall off due to weigh. knee and elbow joints are version 2.0. highly articulated. waist has good twisting range. head is ona ball joint with good range of movement as well. hands are swappable and come on and off easily. good plastic feel to this figure. the weapons on this MSIA are noce, although i would have designed the rifle alot better by making it out of a lighter plastic,its a good accessory. i recommend this MSIA."
4,"Still The Best Marvel Animated Film, so far...","The title kind of says it all - if you've purchased other animated films of Marvel's heroes, and enjoyed them, yet haven't seen this one, you're missing out - it's the best they ever made, and blows away the most recent motion comics they've been putting out...a def. Recommend."
3,A little less that I had expected,"Good, but not real good. Wish it had more extras. Good action, a little more character development would be nice. It starts off like you already know what's going on."
3,pretty good for what it is,"after seeing a few Marvel movies and cartoons that have really been off-beat, i was refreshingly surprised at this one. it was a descent show of what the comics in movie form have the potential of becoming, although with a little higher budget it would be much better. the character movements seemed a little stiff and at times it felt as if they were using the old way to make a cartoon.that was a small blemish. the storyline was all-right, and once again if there were better editing this movie would be great. I loved the visuals for the adjacent dimensions and the idea behind it, but the script seemed rushed and some of the action scenes did as well. I did like the fact that they didn't hold back, meaning they actually killed off many of the characters. I haven't read the comic nor have i seen the TV show, so i don't know how it compares to those, but as for a cartoon on its own, it's worth a watch, but maybe not buying."
1,The magic's gone,"For fans of the 60s and 70s Doctor Strange comics, this animated film will seem as removed from those as the Tom Cruise versions of Mission Impossible from its source. Here, magic has given way to swordplay and martial arts. And the storytelling is pathetic. The first half is too slow, the latter half is too actiony. Worse, the story reeks of ""borrowing"" -- from The Karate Kid, Lost Horizon, The Shadow and every manic action movie since the birth of CGI. Not only is this movie unoriginal -- it's un-Doctor Strange. Someone just ""borrowed"" the names and faces."
1,Dr. Disappointing,"Not the Dr. Strange from the comics. Was hoping to hear some of the odd, quirky spells, and see some of the fantastic dimensional landscapes as envisioned by Dr. Strange creators Stan Lee & Steve Ditko...instead, we get a poor man's version of Harry Potter (bewildered student in a ""school"" for wizards...been there, done that)...Instead of exciting sorcerer battles, we get sword fights with ""lightsabers"" in an obvious rip-off of Star Wars...This was a chance to bring a classic, unique Marvel creation to the limelight, but the producers instead tried to mimic current sci-fi/fantasy trends, and in my opinion, failed miserabley.You've already seen many elements of this film in OTHER movies, folks, Done better.Pass."
1,Is there a doctor in the house?,"Please refer to the previous review by J.A. Eyon entitled ""The Magic's Gone."" I couldn't agree more. All the producers had to do was go back and read the wealth of stories that Marvel Comics has created over the years. And simply pick ONE! Instead, they hire a bunch of no-talent wanna-bes and come up with a lame, unbelievably cliched, pointless work of juvenile fiction that has nothing at all to do with the concept, intent, quality and integrity of the original character the movie is (supposedly) based on!Don't you think that's ""strange""...?!"
4,BluRay version,Very enjoyable. Wish they would have made it a bit more gory (showing blood etc) thus the 4 star rating. The big news thou is the bluray ver has awesome 7.1 surround sound. Come on Amazon include this info in product description.
2,Avarage saturday morning cartoon,"Avarage cartoon, very avarage artwork and it looks like it's filmed at 12 frames p/s. The story has nothing to do with the Steve Ditko's genius original '60's comic. If you like the comic, stay away from this DVD - the next one, Avengers kiddies, looks even worse - You better spend your hard earned cash on your wife or kids, or to stay in cartoon DVD's, I would give DC's Superman - Doomsday a try ..."
3,Disappointing To the Traditiom,"Doctor Strange is one of Marvel's most complex main characters. It reached a pinnacle in its second incarnation with Steve Englehart and Frank Brunner in the comics.There was a TV movie made of it that was rather disappointing.Now, this. To the younger viewer, probably unaware of the grand tradition of the character, the film is probably okay. But it does little service to the original.This is not to say that the film is bad. It just isn't that good. The ""real"" Doctor Strange explored the envelope of mystic philosophy in the comic; this version is just confronted with pithy Zenlike slogans.Particularly in the cartoon medium, it would be possible to extend the visuals to those of the comic books the film is ostensibly derived from. Yet this was overlooked in favor of a much simpler, action-with-little-thought feature.Sorry; I can't rave on this one."
2,A bad reboot,"While it gives an interesting twist on the Dr. Strange story, it's too far removed from the original to be anything but interesting. The concept of a team of magically gifted pseudo-Avenger types, with one traitor, doesn't inspire at all.The graphics are great, and it does well to incorporate some Marvel canon (examine the names of the physicians Dr. Strange sees to cure his hands) but it just doesn't grab you."
4,Marvel Comic Creation,"Good amination, stuck mostly to the original stroy line from the comic, a good movie if you are a Dr. Strange fan or a marevel comic fan."
3,Dr. Strange... a strange choice?,"Like Iron Man, I thought this was done really well. The animation and back story along with the acting was very good. I just question Marvels choice of doing a Dr. Strange animated movie. I am not complaing, I like that they didn't go with the standard X-Men or other really popular characters but it seems like a 'Strange' choice. But Marvel also did a made for TV movie back in the late 70's early 80's of Strange too. So they might be trying to get an old favorite character over with some new fans.Its a good movie and a good story. I recommend it."
5,A superb and unjustly neglected classic.,"Whilst the British Pub-Rock Era of the mid 70s led to success for the likes of Elvis Costello. Ian Dury and Nick Lowe, Graham Parker has tended to be overlooked, and this is unjust. Listen to this superb album and see you if you can understand why! It has everything - a great raw blues sound, full of soul and emotion. It can vary from from the full-throated rock'n'roll of Hotel Chambermaid to the soulful closing ballad of Fool's Gold. There's not a poor track in sight - don't miss it!"
4,Command is Sacrafice,"Not a lot of action, but it shows a side of Picard's character that makes him the Captain he is. A metamorph, a being with the ability to become whatever she needs to be to please her mate, has found Picard of interest to her. He resist, but since she reflects his interest and desire so perfectly, finds her irresistable. But she is to wed the leader of another planet to end decades of war.Her final words to him before becoming another man's wife, the stoney expression on Picard's face as he gives her to that man as part of his duty....You have to watch this one for yourself."
4,replacement part,Price was hard to beat and it does the job.Price was hard to beat and it does the job.
1,Forget it.,"This espresso maker doesn't. That is, it doesn't make espresso. It just sits there while the water boils away; no coffee ever perks to the top. Try a functional, less stylish espresso maker if espresso is what you are looking for."
4,"Great espresso maker, but where to get replacement parts?","My wife bought this after seeing one in use. It does as well as any stovetop espresso maker, and the stainless steel is a nice feature. The only problem is that the sealing ring (rubber?) appears to have shrunk somewhat so the pot leaks a bit as the espresso is made. While it is easy to find replacement rings for the more traditional 3 cup stovetop espresso makers, the outside diameter of the Primula sealing ring, while close in size, is about 1/4 inch larger than those and so the standard rings don't work as replacements. I have not been able to find a source for replacement rings for the Primula pot."
2,Misleading cup capacity,"I thought I was buying a larger pot at 6 cups than the smaller moka pot I was currently using. I never knew the capacity of the older pot, but was sure it was less than ""6 cups"". The top of this Primula pot contains about twice as much espresso as the older pot. Well, when I was making the first pot, I filled the bottom with water and it seemed to be about the same amount as my other pot. So I just did a comparison measure and sure enough, this ""6 cup"" pot actually holds LESS than the older pot. And I know that we are talking demitasse cups here. So I measured how many demitasse cups this new pot would make.. . . only 3. This is not a 6 cup expresso maker. The top of the pot may hold 6 cups but you cannot put that much water in the bottom. I am disappointed because I specifically wanted a larger pot so I could drink Americanos every morning, as well as serve to company. I love the look and feel of it and the stainless steel, but I may have to send it back."
4,"Its no Bialetti, but nice","A huge advantage to this mocha over the Bialetti is that it can be put in the dishwasher. 18/10 is nice quality stainless steel so that was a plus. The handle is silicone/rubberized which may be a concern for those who have gas stoves. I just like the Bialetti and am jaded to that particular mocha.Packaging was nice and it comes with a little nap sack holder for it. This was given as a gift so I do not know the conversion on it, other reviewers have noted a nice 90% conversion (which Bialetti is 90-95%, so about the same)"
4,Enough to help me!,"I used this book in prep for the AP USH May 2006 Test and received a 4 - just start studying around December and you should be fine. My teacher wasn't the greatest and teaching so this was my sole supplement for test prep, very clear and well explained material. Nicely outlined."
3,Not as Good as I thought,"Like all books, there was a good and a bad side to it.The good side, there were multiple choice questions and some sort of essay question or a DBQ type questions. I thought that was helpfull to summerize what you just learn, especially if you are the type of person that has to write things out to remember. I took the multiple choice part of the practice test since i don't have much time left. I did okay, but i think that's just me. I heard that Kaplan tests are the most realistic though.The bad part is that it really sucks at summerizing. It gives an okay opening page of what they are going to talk about and you think its gonna summerize the chapter for you, but they give you the information in vocabulary word form. It seriously is a straight list in alphabetical order too! Because the info is in vocab form, the information does not connect together so sometimes is was difficult to do their essay questions at the end of each section.Don't use this book alone!"
3,"An introduction, not a dissertation, on the Hasidim","Who would have thought that an East European atavism like Hasidic Judaism would be the most--maybe the only--vital form of Judaism today? Maybe, maybe not. In this book the author takes us around to visit many Hasids from all backgrounds. There are interesting facts for the goyish reader to learn--there's something called ""glat kosher"", when ordinary supermarket kosher isn't good enough. We meet callow young converts, fiery older converts, gnarled old Polish survivors, midwestern Hasidic meccas (so to speak), and more. Any generalization about religion will of course prompt other people to leap into print to rebut it. But this is still a good accessible introduction to this tiny, but growing community of faith. I recommend reading this in conjunction with Elie Wiesel's _Souls On Fire_, which is a collection of his grandfather's tales of the old Hasidic masters, including the original, Israel Baal Shem Tov."
4,"Not aways right, but hard to fault the author","I read Boychiks in 1997, and recently picked it up again for a second read. There is no doubt that Eisenberg has created an enjoyable reading experience in this work. It is funny, humorous, self-depreciating, and shows the world of the ultra-orthodox in very human shades. In the 13 years since I read the book, my Jewish knowledge has expanded. As another reviewer remarked, Eisenberg, as an outsider, often does not know what he is looking at; so, in some cases, he can present things in a slightly misleading fashion.On this read, I was struck by how he regards Jewish Renewal. In the few pages he devotes to it, he really fails to provide the full range of the movement's ideas, thoughts and figures (he may even be denegrating it).This is to be expected in a book such as this. The reader should simply beware. Boychiks is hardly the last word on any of the topics explored in its pages."
4,Throw out the drugs. Try this for your child instead.,I wish more American thrapists would realize that there is a tremendous potential for fixing the young brain. But drugs are not the answer. Retraining can be. Read this book if your child isn't what he or she could be. Don't refill the next prescription.
2,Beware postage!,"Got this adaptor plug to use laptop in Europe. On Amazon, had a great price ($1.99), problem was that postage came to an extra $9! I have no complaint aginst the product (small, lightweight and good construction) but the wildly over the top postage cost leaves a bitter feeling.For less than the (postage included) cost, I could have easily gotten same adaptor in local Radio Shack or Best Buy and without the five day postal delay."
3,Anything Judy,"I'm going to give it three stars since I bought it for the Ford Star Jubilee performance which I didn't have, so it's valuable to me for that reason alone. However, the picture is awful, sound not good, but it's still Judy Garland and I hate to miss any scrap of footage of this wonderful entertainer. It's my only reason for buying it."
2,Old cartridges,"I installed the cartridge in my printer just a few days after receiveing it. My printer immediated claimed that the cartridge was less than half full. Only 2 months later of realitively light use (less than 50 pages total printed), and now I am getting warnings about the cartridge being nearly depleted.This is NOT a problem with the brand - my guess is that it was on the shelf for a long time before being sold."
4,Best Price,I have used this product for my Canon Pixma with no problems. I have found the best prices on Amazon and do not have to run around to shop for the cartridges. Can usually purchase with free shipping.
3,"Quality Good, Life Duration Short","Product quality is good. Just wish these cartridges which seem to get more expensive each month, would last longer."
4,Canon BCI-24 Ink Tank,Ink Tanks sned were OEM and are performing well. Shipping costs were much nigher than needed for the size/wt of the package.
4,"It's an ink cartridge, but SELLER INCLUDED INSERT ASKING FOR 5-STAR REVIEW","It's an ink cartridge. It arrived on-time, and it works. No surprises other than the fact it arrived in OEM-type packaging rather than the glossy from the photo. Not a problem as far as I'm concerned, but it probably should be noted somewhere in the item description.However, the retailer included a small business card asking for a 5-star review on Amazon. It did not promise anything in return (so not super-shady) but it still struck me as improper."
5,Used with Canon i470D printer,"Wow, can't believe you guys gave this product a bad review because Amazon charges shipping! Shouldn't give any product a bad review just because of the shipping. Find someone with Amazon Prime and ask them to add your account for the free shipping benefits. I purchased the membership a while back after my trial was up because I usually stick with Amazon for my online shipping needs. 2nd day free shipping is worth it!Anyways, back to the product...this inkjet tank is decent. I haven't had any issues with my aging Canon i470D printer. I print mailing addresses for the use with eBay, Resumes, and basic directions mainly. Haven't had any text smearing issues whats so ever. Even after I haven't used the printer for months, it still did a great job."
5,IT IS WHAT IT IS,IT IS INK. IT DOES ITS JOB. THE INK DOES NOT DRY OUT EASILY AND LAST FOREVER IT SEEMS LIKE.
2,Shame it did not work!,"Sadly, the ink cartridge had been sitting somewhere for a while, as when I installed it there was hardly any colour left! It was like it had 'dried up'!"
5,the best,by canon for canon. expensive but i am worth not getting a headache from an inferior product.
5,Use ONLY Canon color ink tanks with Canon printers,"There are several other brands that manufacture identical type color ink tanks but you should not use them. In comparison with the Canon ink tank they are conspicuously less accurate in color and lower in quality. They easily jam up the printer, costing more to repair the printer than the initial savings they provide.While it may be safe to go with different brands for black ink, stay with this high-quality Canon ink tank for color."
4,Great for MP360,"I use Canon MP360 printer-scanner and I use this inkjet tank in it. Well, what I can say about this. It is quite small tank but the quality of it is great. The ink lasts about 200-250 copies and it is easy to put to MP360. Highly recommended. I guess they could have done a little bit bigger...if you use as a private use, this is for you but if you need many copies...hundreds or thousands...I recommend other printer and other inkjet tanks."
1,Compatibility error,"The ""Will This Work with Your Printer"" tool told me that this cartridge would work in my Canon BJC-2110 printer. I purchased it (actually from somewhere else), and it does not fit--it is not the same as the BCI-21 black cartridge. I just wanted to let others who might have the older BJC-2100 series printers know this information."
3,"Black Ink Cartridge, Canon","Product quality is good. Just wish these cartridges which seem to get more expensive each month, would last longer."
3,BCI-24 tank too small,"I purchased a Canon MP360 Color printer/scanner/copier based on customer reviews. It has so far performed well except for the black ink tank. I type many reports and have found the ink tank entirely too small. My old Canon BJ200 prints far more pages than the BCI-24. In fact if someone knows of another company which sells a compatible BCI-24 tank with more storage, let me know!"
3,Runs out quickly...,"I am using MP390 with this ink cartridge, and it seems on a daily basis I print out an average of 1-2 pages. Ink seems to run out by about a month or so, which is not very good in my opinion. I have no comparison with other printers like lexmark or HP, but it seems that despite the canon ink is cheaper, you also run out faster so you have to buy more... so at the end, maybe it's all the same?"
1,Where's my free shipping?,I have bought ink catridges elsewhere for a while now because Amazon does not offer free shipping on this product anymore...
4,Great value and price,Great genuine Canon product at a great price. The multi-pack works well with two black and one color cartridge.
4,oldie but goodie,I am happy that I can continue to buy ink for my old printer. the prices are good and the printer keeps chugging. thanks for keeping the ink available.
4,Good Deal,"I purchased 3 color and 2 black ink tanks for $26.15 including shipping which I think was a good price. So far, the two tanks I have installed are doing great. However, I could not find an expiration date on the boxes. I hope this is not a problem 6 to 8 months from now."
5,Awesome taste - don't get any other brand!!!,There are other brands of Nam Prik Pao out there - only this one has the complex taste sensation you will always treasure. Easiest way to enjoy Nam Prik Pao is to just mix it with freshly cooked Thai Jasmine Rice. Pantai Nam Prik Pao will send your taste buds on a spicy trip which you can enjoy whenever you wish. It's good stuff!!!
1,bird house,not happy with order in pic it show 4 pices that how come i order ---got one pices will not ordef again thank you???? PAUL
4,In a different time and place.,"It was almost a lifetime ago when H.E. Bates wrote A Month by the Lake and Other stories. Perhaps, his writing is a little dated. However, I just love his use of metaphors. For example when Bates has Major Wilshaw describe Ms. Bentley as having ""a mustardy sense of humour, a little dry and hot on the tongue as it were.""You just can't get that in ""Modern"" day novella. Today's authors are too busy trying to discover governmental plots, or shop the entirety of London. Don't get me wrong. I savour these types of fiction too.I'm just so glad that I stumbled upon these short stories. It takes me back a different time and place where people took time out of their day to feel the breeze brush past them. They peeled grapes, posted mail, and rode trains from England to Italy."
3,The Title Story Is the Best,"I bought this collection in order to read the title story, 'A Month by the Lake"". I was so very fond of the movie on which the story was based. I was not disappointed in the title story, but the other stories were rather bland and ""very British"". They all seemed to have been hastily written and rather pointless.H.E. Bates may have been quite esteemed by his writing colleagues of that time period, but to this reader I felt unattached and unfeeling as to his style and content."
4,MAGIC SHOW IS A HIT WITH MY SON,"I PURCHASED THIS KIT FOR MY SON AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT. HE IS 12 YEARS OLD, AND IS HAVING GREAT FUN ENTERTAINING ANYONE WILLING TO WATCH. HE TOOK IT TO EASTER TO WOW THE FAMILY-IT WORKED WITH THE 8 AND UNDER CROWD! GOOD PURCHASE."
4,Excellent one-sit read!,"In spite of the fact that Kevin Costner will soon be interpreting this novel, I bought this book because I was curious about a baseball story written by my favorite author. I was not disappointed!! Michael Shaara's stream-of-conscience style transported me into Billy Chapel's mind. Even with little understanding of the thrills of baseball, Chapel's story really touched home.A perfect book for the airplane! (3 hour read max)If you liked this book, read ""The Killer Angels""! It remains my favorite book of all time!"
1,Corny,"I admired ""The Killer Angels"" that led me to read the much less interesting books by Michael Shaara's son: the one who discovered and published this posthumous novel. Maybe he should have left it in the drawer. And the same goes for Kevin Costner and his mediocre film more or less inspired by this book. I've found the prose, with sentences three words long and a deluge of periods, irritating. I've found the plot commonplace. I've found the alternate storytelling (story of the last game in the player's career and his love story) clumsy. But this is not Michael's fault: I didn't publish this novel after all. His son enjoys cash and kudos, lucky guy."
4,My Review,"This book is not just about baseball. It' about life. It tells a story about a man's struggle with love and life. What I thought was so awesome about this book was it made a personnal connection to me. I felt I could understand what Billy Chapel was feeling and why he did the things he did. ""Clay lies still, but blood's a rover; Breath's a ware that will not keep. Up, lad: when the journey's over. There'll be time to sleep."" Introdution. When I first read this when I began the book, I didn't understand it. But when I finished the book it made perfect sense. Never give up till the job's done. It fit Billy Chapel's persona perfect. The only prombelm with the book is that it is a liitle bit hard to understand at first. But when you finnaly get in to it, it's one of the best books ever. I think everyone should read this book."
4,Shaara uses all his story-telling skills and shines!,The story of Billy Chapel is a story about all of us and baseball. The magic of the game infects us all. Shaara puts you there inside the head of the pitcher during the game which allows us all to pitch a perfect game. A perfect book!
2,A major disappointment from an accomplished author,"Michael Shaara usually spins a good tale and pulls the reader into the world of his characters. In this work, however, he seems to be disengaged. Perhaps it is because he was a boxer rather than a baseball player in his youth. Perhaps his agent was pushing for something to publish. Shaara misses the mark and not only doesn't make us ex-ball players identify with the characters, the story line is weak and transparent. Not up to the standards of The Broken Place or Killer Angels. Kinda like a weekday soap as opposed to Masterpiece Theater. The best thing about the book is that it is mercifully short."
1,should not be aloud to be sold to anyone,"This game is by far the worst game i have ever had the misfortune of playing. Forever Kingdom has the worst voice acting and fighting scenes EVER!!!! The opening movie has the main characters fighting a cripple and lossing.The music is annoying and redundant. The enemies are so umbelievaly stupid( monkeys and pigs with green spikes on their backs) when you buy extra clothing and armor for them they dont even touch their bodies, i mean the cape just floats around. The puzzles should be used as a test to find out whether your kids have some sort of mental disablilty. I strongly urge you not to buy rent or borrow this game."
2,Adapter Collet Pin Chuck,"This will fit a small drill bits, but claiming that it fits Dremel Tools is misleading. The thread on this adapter does NOT fit the Dremel Mini keyless chuck, which was the primary reason for purchasing, and was posted, as a recommendation with this item. What should be said is, ""It accepts the Dremel Collets"". Also I have to mention that the shank that comes out the back is bent and made of a very weak metal, so when you put that in a drill, it wobbles.Thank goodness, the thick part of the shank it true and just the right size to fit in a standard lathe Center chuck. I will modify this to fit properly."
5,Party essential!,"This is a nice mojito set. If you really like mojitos it helps to have the right kind of glasses to make the drink. These are the glasses you want. The extra stuff is nice to have, but the muddler you can buy anywhere."
3,great party set.....,This set is more fragile than I expected but if you are careful you will get good use for it.... pour the Mojitos...!!!
1,Absolute complete disappointment,Solid black line directly through center of TV screen separating two different 'doors' for the game I was playing (or trying to). Game that was being used was Super Smash Bros. Melee. TV being used was a Sony Bravia HD. Do not buy this. Next thing I plan on trying out is the monster cable with s-video built in. Big massive disappointment.
4,Definitely helps,"These S-Video cables definitely helped the visual quality of my N64 on my 46"" Dynex HDTV. But don't go in expecting some sort of amazing new experience. It is ultimately an N64 on an HDTV. It will only get so good. These cable eliminated a lot of blur and increased the sharpness of objects in the foreground. Once you go past a certain point though, things get fuzzy again."
1,Grainy Picture,Did not receive same product as shown in picture. S-video produced extremely grainy picture. Composite video and audio worked as it should.
3,"Very thin, easy to break wires.",I have the av cord shown in the picture. The four wires at the end are very thin and will easily tangle up with each other. They will break if you're not careful with them.
4,Suggestions,I would have love to get in a soft cover and have references in its verses. A concordance in one language ( at least) would have been wounderful.The printing was not dark enough way to light.I understand that adding the concordance would enlarge it too much but the other things are needed.
3,Not sure it helped,After running this product through our VCR twice the machine still said the heads needed to be cleaned.
3,Not As Good As Williamson's SF,"I enjoyed this series, but it wasn't nearly as good as the science fiction he writes. These characters are more cliche and the plotting more predictable compared to the Weapon. It just didn't seem as inspired when we are talking new worlds and alternative philosphies."
1,Don't buy this part.,"This part is not OEM spec'd. The plastic sleeve from the original wouldn't fit in this one. Worse, the clamp stretched out on the very first opening of the door and won't hold the door open....and now because it's stretched out, I can't get it out of the door to replace it.Bottom line...you get what you pay for."
2,door strap,"The product arrived quickly and was appropriately priced. The installation was straightforward. However, it does not keep the door open and the metal is not spring like enough to hold it. I am disappointed in its functionality."
1,I tried them and they are junk,These don't hold the door open just like everyone here as said. Luckily they said I can return them and get a refund.
1,Spend a little more and buy factory part,"The door check strap is made of extremely soft metal. The clip that hooks on the door is spread out and would not hold door open, then bent open so far it got jammed on the door. I had to mutilate the strap to get the door to close, subsequently denting and scratching the door. This was after the first time I used the back door after installation. The factory replacement part from Chevy cost more, but you get what you pay for."
3,For Children,"This performance might be suitable for children. I was only able to watch the first act. There was no ballet. It was just the children running and jumping around. Even if it is dated, I think the version with Baryshnikov is the best.Tchaikovsky - The Nutcracker / Baryshnikov, Kirkland, Charmoli"
5,Excellent!,My daughter loves the Nutcracker and she was glued to this as soon as we got it in the mail. I appreciate that there is not JUST music - there is some narration. Very pleased with this purchase!
3,"Balanchine 10, Caulkin 0","Of all the versions of Nutcracker out there, this probably sells the best, due to the popularity of its' child star. Too bad. My students find him looking and dancing ridiculous, and I agree. For an imaginative and more engaging (albeit strange) interpretation, watch the Sendak/Pacific Northwest Ballet version. It is far more entertaining."
3,Who is that dork who can't dance? Otherwise brilliant.,"There is little to criticise the dancers in this beautiful production. The use of children, often absent in other productions, brings the brilliant show closer to an important audience: the children themselves. The music is good enough that it isn't distracting, although a little more rubato would have been appropriate, particularly in the waltz.George Luca's special effects are extremely well done, leaving the first-time viewers convinced that these effects can actually be done on stage (they weren't)I said there is little to criticise the dancers. Macaulay Culkin cannot be described as one of the dancers and he can't dance, walk, or even move in the manner dancers do. The producer deserves the bulk of the criticism for selecting him. He just can't dance. George Ballanchine must be rolling in his grave. If someone who can actually dance played the nutcracker's part, my rating would have been 5 stars."
1,reviewing Nutcracker DVD,"I bought The Nutcracker DVD and my grandchildren loved it. We only played in five times or so and yesterday when we tried watching it, half way through it gets stuck and won't go any further. It's broken! So glad you asked me for my review because I have been trying to find a way to contact you about this problem. I really feel that I should be given a new DVD, but, again, don't know how to contact you and talk about the problem. Please refer these comments to the appropriate people. We did love it when it worked!"
5,Wonderful version for children,I selected this version because of what others said about the use of children in the cast and I was not disappointed. I was very pleased with how natural they were (except for Culkin). My three-year-old grand-niece was enthralled from start to finish.
5,The Nutcracker Suite,I ordered this as a Christmas present for a granddaughter. I saw the video in the past and was impressed with it so I wanted to share it.
5,The Enchanting Nutcracker- Balanchine's Masterpiece,"The Nutcracker, is indeed the most enchanting ballet I have ever seen. It boils down to pure talent, as shown by the students of the School Of American Ballet. The students are by far the most talented and so are the company memebers. It is overwhelming to see such talent. Bravo!"
1,"Instant View, so only my time was wasted","I would be very disappointed if I had actually paid to see this. I couldn't watch the whole thing; smirking Macauley Culkin prevented that. I don't recommend this version of Nutcracker at all. If there was an option for no stars, that's how I'd rate it."
5,Great production!,"This is an awesome complete Nutcracker.I especially like the music as recorded here.I watched it once on TV, mostly becauseMac Culkin was in it in a small part.But I liked the whole production,and it isn't on TV often enough."
3,"Good ""family"" entertainment","This version of The Nutcracker is a good version if you are looking for a bright, cheery, good quality and overall modern version. Kids will enjoy being able to see caracters up close. (A travesty when watching such amazing dancers). The camera work does get pretty close but overall it's not unbelievably irritating like some movie versions of ballets I have seen. It's tolerable. Think of it as a movie with lots of dancing in it. It is definitly a ""made for TV"" production.Micaulay Culkin in his post ""Home Alone"" popularity is also...tolerable. We know he's not a dancer, it's quite obvious, so you gotta give the poor little guy a break.Had no issues with film/sound quality or clarity.A good version to throw on the TV as background during Holiday gatherings.Still favor the Baryshnikov version but I think it might be a little drab for children."
4,An expetacular presentation of the dancers,"Balanchine used all his inspiration in this performance. But, unfortunetly we had Macaulay in a terrible presentation."
5,"Aww, we LOVE THIS!",My daughter is a ballet dancer for numerous years and we absolutely love this version of The Nutcracker as it is the original one! We have been to the real live production several times every winter. Please do not hesitate to buy this!
2,Dissapointing,"The recording was of very poor quality, but even worse was the quality of the sound.Made it almost impossible to watch.However perhaps I was just unlucky and was sent an inferior copy.Macaulay Culkin was ridiculous as the young prince.I bought this as an introduction to the Nutcracker for my small grand daughter, however was so dissapointed that I won't bother to give it to her."
1,I Didn't Care For This Nutcracker,I love dance and that was seriously lacking in the first half of this film.You don't see any ballet until the Sugar Plum Fairy hits the scene. I felt cheated.I don't understand all the praise. I really don't.
1,Not so Outstanding,"This was a dissapointment. When I first watched the movie, I almost fell asleep during the first act. If I was you, just skip the entire first half and go right to the dancing snowflakes. The first act had no interesting roles dance wise. The second half was pretty good(dance roles of the sweets....hot chocolate,candy cane,etc.)Any part with Culkin was a drag, in the fact that his dancing was horrible and the steps that he was given were horrible too. The girl that played Marie looked like she could have been a good dancer, but they flunked out when giving her a role with no ballet dancing. If you are a fan of ballet dancing like me, I would not recommend this version of the Nutcracker. The only good parts were the dances of the sweets and the snowflakes, the rest was fast forward worthy material. So give yourself a break, and get a better version. I wish I had."
5,Classic,"The movie strays somewhat from the play. The transition between the party and the mouse battle is new to me. Overall, though, a very good stage production! The narration is great for those seeing the Nutcracker for the first time."
5,Very good. Would have been great if Culkin weren't in it.,"Looks like the execs needed some star to sell it from the shelfs, as though the ballet stars were not enough. Now Culkin looks like a little twerp and he was. There are so many more talented people who could have filled his shoes more gracefully.The film is beautiful and at a great price. Get it for your collection. The sets are wonderful and the storytelling up to par.Three thumbs up!"
2,Baryshnikov version is much better,"Very disappointing if you actually want to see some ballet dancing.There is no real dancing for the first hour, just theater and kids running around. The battle with the mice is not very dramatic, and, because Macaulay Caulkin is playing the nutcracker prince, there's nodancing there. The second act is better, as the various candies andDarci Kistler are lovely. Caulkin is totally out of place and distracts. For a much better version, with lots of great ballet dancing and an absolutely fabulous battle scene with the mice, see the American Ballet Theater version with Baryishnikov and Gelsey Kirkland. Barynikov is out of this world as the nutcracker prince."
4,The Nutcracker,I thoroughly enjoyed the dancing. Macaulay Culkin seemed awkward; he should not have been in the movie. A dancer should have played his part.
1,Very disappointing,The video is grainy. The camera moves around a lot - lots of close up - hard to follow the dancing.
2,to generic,"wasnt to bad of an ending,But definately not one of steven seagals best movies,the problim with this movie was that it was to generic.not that theres anything wrong with generic movies,But this movie was poorly written.good acting,but bad directing also,and poorly written.you might want to rent it before buying it."
3,Steven back in form.,"watching seagal movies forever i have noticed you cant really have high hopes for oscar like acting and script. what you can do is prey that he is on par with his aikido skills and his gun and knife play. in past movies cant remember what ones but i have niticed him using a stunt double for fight scenes and that realy took away from his movies. i want steven seagal. but ok enough's enough. Steven seagal say what you will the guy can act and he can fight and can lead a sub par movie. but this is not a sub par movie. with better budget i would have like to see this in the theatre it could have brought the man back. he did his own fights, and his accent was not bad, i thought for a second that he was russian. this was a good movie, and actually worth the money.. for some not for others."
3,Another so so effort from Seagal,Driven to Kill is another so so release from Seagal's library of DTV movies. Better than some and not nearly a good as say The Keeper or Belly of the Beast. I know it's difficult with so many movies being made these days that coming up with an original script is not easy. Guess was hoping for some more originality but all in all worth at least one viewing.Peter J. Miller
4,service great,"the delivery time on this was excellent,, have not viewed video yet as it is Christmas gift.. but packaging is perfect.. looks great..."
2,Driven to kill,Driven to Kill [Blu-ray]Decent film 3 out of 5But awful picture quality for a blu ray 1 out of 5If your a steven seagal fan you will enjoy this movie.Pick up or rent the dvd instead of the blu ray
2,"My first Seagal film--and, hopefully, my last","Let me begin by saying: I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal--don't like him, his movies are not my cup of tea. I watched this because I'm a fan of Igor Jijkine, and wanted to see him in something outside of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.I went into the movie with low expectations, and so was not disappointed when the movie lived up (down?) to them. I did, however, have to fight the urge to vomit when Ruslan's girlfriend suggested a threesome...I was disappointed that Igor Jijikine, while good in the movie, didn't have more to do. He mostly yelled, or stood around looking like a badass, which, admittedly, is something he does well. And, the guy playing his son looks like he's *maybe* five years younger--!So basically, the two stars are for Igor. One because it's nice to see him with more dialogue than he had in Crystal Skull, and one for being the only good thing about my first--and, I pray, last--Steven Seagal film."
1,Segal and another loser,"Well, we keep waiting for a decent movie from Segal, but they just keep getting worse. I guess the junk will continue as long as his long suffering fans keep buying this Direct To The Garbage Can crap. The movie does not even deserve one star but I had to put some rating in to warn folks that have not purchased his movie. Will I buy the next one? Probably not."
4,good movie,well i am very sorry but this the best steven seagal i've seen from a long timeok he is old big and fat but the story is ok many gun fights are ok many fights are very okso it is a good entertainment not stupid so you can try it if you like steven
4,satisfactory,"I am satisfied with this product in 90%.Quality is very good and everything is OK, but it doesn't have enough space for charger."
5,Great stemless wine glasses,"My husband has been after me to replenish our assortment of wine glasses and after reading the reviews I chose the Libbey Vina Stemless. They are 16.5 ounce size which is great, very attrative, and I especially like the stemless feature. If you have problems with glassware breaking easily, I would suggest you choose another type. They aren't paper fragile, but probably won't tolerate rough handling."
5,Inexpensive and great for red wine,"These are inexpensive and work great for red wine. Wine glasses with stems look great but sometimes they are a pain to wash without inadvertently breaking a stem. These might not be as good for white wine, since they don't have a stem, you hold the glass and not the stem and your hand may warm up the glass slightly more than if you were holding the glass by its stem. They are big enough for any size you want to pour and they don't take up a lot of space in the cupboard. No problem breaking them when washing them either."
4,Just what you'd expect,"I have Amazon Prime, so no shipping costs were involved. The price was right and they presented a fun change to serving drinks/wine at parties during the holidays. An unintended upside was our eleven-year-old deciding that formerly ""yukky"" drinks (milk, juice) were rendered desirable when placed in the new glass."
2,"Bad buy, the glass is too big to hold. Everyone wore red wine.","I thought this would be the solution of the unintended bumped wine glass. Too often a guest would pass a plate and their sleeve would catch the rim of their wine glass. Over the glass would go, spilling wine all over the table. I was wrong, these are worse.The table was set, dinner was served and the wine poured (The glasses were just a 3rd full.). As a guest lifted one just a foot off the table the glass slipped. As it slipped it fell in a spinning motion. Not only did the table get splashed with red wine so did everyone at the table, not good.So do you want to tell me why these glasses must be 16 oz., which is too big to hold without a stem? No one fills a red wine glass to the rim. Keep the same design but reduce the size to a 12-14 oz glass so a person can hold the glass.You get 2 stars because shipping was free. Wine glass design gets a big ZERO.Libbey Vina 16-3/4-Ounce Stemless Red-Wine Glasses, Set of 4"
3,too small,"It has an appealingly simple, clean, uncomplicated design. It is practical, useful, and is tasteful for a light, pleasant family & friend's brunch. However, I personally felt that the design is too small and not as detailed as it could be."
4,Decent glasses for the price,Arrived on time and in original packaging. Nice looking stemless red wine glasses; great deal for the price esspecially considering I paid $6 a pop for similar white wine glasses just a week or two earlier!
5,Great Glasses for the Money,I bought these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. Now she buys wine just so she can use the glasses. They look cool and for the price can't be beat.
2,Can do better,"The glasses were okay, nothing great and nothing horrible. Just about right for the price point, and I would have given them three stars, but two of the glasses had flaws in the lip area. They are going back."
3,Too big for small hands,"These are very pretty glasses no doubt. But, if your a petite lady as I am with small hands, they are too big to hold onto. I was trying to keep my hand on my glass while the sweat from my chilled wine was making me lose my grip! I finally had to hold my glass with both hands like a child just to keep it from slipping through! These glasses are alot larger around than I had thought.These are pretty and neat, but if you have small hands make sure you get something you can easily use."
4,"Nice product, a bit large","My mother and I love drinking wine, so I ordered a set of these wine glasses for her for Christmas. They are of excellent quality for the price I paid; however, they are a bit large for a comfortable grip. I understand that these are ""red"" wine glasses, which tend to have a larger bulb; however, these are rather wide and I caught myself using a second hand to make sure I wouldn't drop them! Not sure of the exact diameter of the widest part of the glass, but if you have small hands (like my mother and I), I would probably buy the white wine glasses!"
4,Large Stemless Wine Glasses,"I was looking for an inexpensive set of stemless wine glasses for a gift for a friend. These glasses are attractive, although quite large, but they were in my price range so I got them anyway. I would have preferred a smaller red wine glass, but these will do the trick. They were shipped to me separately from other items in my order, and I received them very quickly, which was nice. They were also well-packaged and came through the delivery process intact."
5,"Simple, cheap, and unremarkable","There isn't much to say about this product. The set is 10 bucks, so the price is right. The glasses are light and delicate like wine glasses should be, but not to the point that you feel they're going to break easily. They can handle some slight mishandling, but don't expect amazing durability. For the price, I don't think you can beat this set if you're looking for stemless red wine glasses. However, I will say that they aren't the most eye-catching pieces of glassware in the world. They're very simple and designed with function in mind. I think I'm also going to get a set of traditional stemmed wine glasses, simply because I'm sometimes in the mood to drink wine in something a little more visually interesting.
