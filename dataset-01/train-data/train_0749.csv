4,Bad discs,"Enjoyed the program, hated the bad copies.I returned the discs twice and got bad copies both times. Seems the makers of the discs aren't very careful about how they are made. The disc would stop in mid-episode and not continue.I still haven't gotten a good copy yet."
3,Suspect copy of Babylon 5 Season 4,"I bought my copy of Babylon 5 Season 4 from inet. I'm looking at the episode, The Illusion of Truth and some scenes are grainy. I bought the complete series from various dealers, and three of the five I bought from inet. They took extraordinarily long to deliver. I think that it was just more than the holiday mail crunch. My copy might be a bootleg. I am of this opinion because the video should be crisp and clean.I am a big fan of the series, and I love practically everything about it."
5,Ivanova Rocks!,"When Ivanova captains a ship in the group attacking Earth (after the resolution of the Shadow war)-- she gets one of the best speeches anyone in the series -- or in almost any action flic ever -- has had. You'll know it when you hear it -- it ends with ""God sent me."" She got more of the great lines than anyone else except possibly Londo. Tracy Scoggins did not really fill her shoes, although she filled other things for the series. (Seven of Nine, anyone?)Seriously, though, I believe that B5 dealt well with the concept of ""warrior spirit"" -- in many of the characters, regardless of the side they were on."
4,A mostly good season,"Babylon 5 is Babylon 5 and even a slightly off season is better then most anything you are going find on the air these days. My problem with this season is not that the characters are growing thin or episodes are bad but my problem is one of plot. One issue in particular the final outcome of the Shadow War. Ultimately instead of the knock-down drag out we were expecting we get one of the most notorious cop-outs in recent television history. As a consequence the final resolution of the Clark Administration while it is satisfactory happens much too quickly.Overall-There is still plenty of good to be found in this season my favorite episode is probably ""Racing Mars"" but the ultimate revelation of what happened to Mr. Garibaldi should not be missed. Also don't miss any episode where Alfred Bester shows up, they are important."
4,"Great show, best season, worst transfer so far","I have waited impatiently for Season Four to be released, now I wish that I'd waited longer for Warner Bros. to improve upon the quality of the transfer. Into the Fire was possibly the worst episode in terms of the inconsistent quality of the shots. Some screens are downright grainy and poorly lit and yet the next can be truly watchable.For the show, 9/10, for the transfer 4/10. Warner Bros. can and must do better for Season 5."
3,Babylon 5,"I still love this series, but this copy was for the birds! Half of them wouldn't play without a fight. If the seller hadn't labeled them ""viewed once"" I might be happier, but it was viewed a lot more than that!!"
2,"Superb series, but poor quality DVD","Babylon 5 is my favorite Sci. Fi. series, and Season 4 stands equal to Season 3 as THE best in the series. I am extremely frustrated, however, with the poor quality of the Season 4 DVD collection, and would dissuade people from purchasing (rent if you're able!). I've had both sound and video issues with Season 4, and despite my love of this series, I'll probably not purchase Season 5 ... it's just too maddening to tolerate the poor/intermittent sound quality and annoying video problems. Extremely irritating that a company would do such a substandard job in a DVD release."
3,"when a review is so hated, it's probably worth reading","I gave B5 Season One zero-stars because it is horrible, and for some reason watched season II hoping for a little entertainment (to no avail) but there is a dedicated fan following, so I tried again with the 4'th and got a little entertainment.The show is still peppered with a few bad actors that make you cringe when they say their three lines. And there is STILL something terribly wrong with those graphics, yet SOME are really good. It's so puzzling, and weird that they would spend so much on set-design and then have that horrible CGI mixed in. Almost everything did improve on my scale (writing, acting, money-shots, etc.) but it's hard to see this show ever being more three stars."
5,GREAT PRICE!,"Great Price, Good condition, hard item to find, butt worth every penny since it is one of the greatest stories ever told."
3,Damaged product case.,"I received my order in a timely and efficient manner, however when I opened it, I found that the actual DVD case was damaged to a point that I would call destroyed. The DVDs themselves were loose, however I would note that I haven't found any damage to the disks themselves. It is a repackaged product so I am not making any claim other than it would have been beneficial if the case had been replaced when it was repackaged rather than just rewrapped. I have ordered previous repackaged DVDs, and they were not in this condition.Thank you for your time. This is not a complaint as much as my simply stating to be aware that this could happen."
5,This book made me laugh and cry...highly recommend.,"I felt like I was soo close to Sharlie, her feelings and thoughts became real to me. I rooted for her, cried, and laughed. I can't wait to read another book by Sally Mandel."
2,"Touching story, but....","This is a touching story, and well written. However, although Sharli was ill, I felt her character wasn't strong enough in mind. With her life basically being taken away from her, I would expect her to be more headstrong and independent in having the best kind of life she could. She seemed easily pushed down into the direction her parents would put her in. When she has a chance to really live, she barely fights for it. Good story, and believable... however, I would have liked to find a stronger character in mind to more actively go after what she wanted, or needed. In addition, I felt her parents were unreasonably hard, and almost unloving. I had to force myself to finish this book, and then was very disappointed when I did."
4,Great apples delivered quick!,The apples where devlivered quick. I was able to bake the apples and have great apple pie for the holiday. Thanks.
3,How do you say a classic is way overated?,"Sure the poetry is great,but these three plays make a small episode in modern terms...A very slow one at that.The three plays:1) Agamemnon: The killing of the returned King and Cassandra the oracle by the wife and the cousin2) The Libation Bearers: The meeting of Orestes and Electra at the gave and the killing ofthe mother and cousin3) The Eumenides: the trial by Athena of Orestes with Apollo defendingAs plays go they are more excess of dialog than action...many too long and very heavy speeches.There are too many questions about the natures of these sins and the justice of revenge when men are the top civil authority in the bronze age, so later plays like these that bring in gods as judges were formulated. These plays survived their age to bring us the Greek ideals of justice,but they fail to keep a modern audience awake!I'm not impressed by Aeschylus' plays compared to other Greek plays that I've read by Sophocles."
1,Only read this if you want to re-read a few times..,"This book was boring, and poorly setup....It consists of too much stupid diction, and the tone fails it in many places.If you have to read this for a class, or are considering a form of suicide, then turn to this book.."
5,"Translation is OK, but probably not the best...","I read this for an ancient political theory class, and while the translation is lucid, it seems awkward in many places and not very poetic. My teacher uses both this translation and another (the Lattimore, I believe) in class, and the latter is more poetic.I couldn't say which is more accurate, however.This trilogy is a classic, though, and is definitely worth reading."
4,text book,a required text for a greek mythology class. I found that I enjoyed greek literature. the book shipped quickly and was well priced for a used book.
1,POR EL AMOR DE DIOS QUE ES ESTO ?,"Con todo respeto a los que le han dado cinco estrellas a este disco y a cualquier otro de esta seudo banda de glam metal, me permito gritar al cielo ¿ QUE LES PASA ? este disco imitador como todos de las bandas de los 80's con extensiones de cabello y trajes rídiculos y letras tontas, no vale un centavo, me parece que el director de mercadeo de la casa disquera o la banda piensa que no habemos verdaderos metaleros que aprecian el metal clásico de bandas como, Judas Priest, Saxon,Iron Maiden etc.Un buen consejo, no gasten su dinero en discos como este."
3,Must buy if you play Omaha 8,"Little is published on this game, so if you are into omaha 8 you should buy it all. My main objection to this book is the writing style. I like a less conversational approach; 'just the facts' and if it's important put a star by it.This book gives organized guidelines on flop play(page 106-107) that are quite helpful to a new player that wants specific advice, and any points of play considered important are emphasized.I would be wary of reviewers that praise this book above all others. They tend to be new players. There are great insights in books by Zee, Cappelletti, Ciaffone, Slotboom, Brunson, etc. If advice contradicts try to reason out why and you'll probably become a better player.For a new fixed limit player this is a good start but I would also get Zee's book. Also just go online and get what you can from websites.Then get experience and be a nit. lol"
3,Good enought,"good book to everyone who wants to start playing the omaha/8 and even to more experient players , no doubt a good investiment."
4,Pretty Cool Trip Back in Time,"I ordered this after my 11 year old daughter and I saw a Monkee's special on television. She had no idea that they had a TV show, and that I watched it every Saturday morning. Anyway, she thinks the DVD is AWESOME, and the Monkee's rock. I think the DVD is pretty good. Nice to see the guys as they are now, and hear their comments about the 4 episodes on the disc. Well worth the money if you are a fan of the Monkee's, or of campy 60's tv shows!"
3,"Micky's got some good Frodis, man.","The main reason I bought this DVD was ""The Frodis Caper"", in which Dolenz mocks the show itself while thumbing his nose at the censors with marijuana references(I imagine Micky and Jon Anderson engaged in a lotta Maryjane kissing while writing the story).It looks pretty much like a forerunner to their film ""Head"" and was clearly an indication on what the show would be like had it not been cancelled.The second reason was Mike's fave ""Fairy Tale"", which I haven't seen in 40 years. For some reason, it was never syndicated with the rest of the series. It wasn't as good as ""Frodis"", but it was a nice change from the usual Monkee tale.The other two, Davy's ""Hitting the High Seas""(a waterlogged Pirate Movie parody) and Peter's ""Monkees vs. Machine""(an sudtle attack on dehumanization.) were funny the first time, but after the next thousand times they get a little stale. You want these, buy the complete set."
4,Very Pleasing,"This DVD gives a sample of some of the Monkees TV episodes that the Monkees picked themselves as their favorites.Two of my favorite episodes were Peter Tork's ""Monkees vs. Machine"" and Micky Dolenz's ""Frodis Caper."" The comments that the Monkees talked about were very good. I especially liked Peter's comments on his episode. The only reason I gave four stars to this DVD was because of the picture quality of the episodes. They are watchable but have not been remastered.If you are a Monkees fan, this DVD is for you. Let's also hope that all of the Monkees episodes are re-released soon!"
4,monkee's dvd,i ordered this dvd so my visiting grandaughters could have a good laugh. they did. they enjoyed it so much they took it home with them.
3,Problem with DVD,"I could never get this DVD to play in my DVD player. It will play in my computer. As a result, I have never actually watched it. I have never had a disk fail to work in my DVD player before. Perhaps this was just a bad disk."
2,"Davy is little, but PETTY?!!","First off, I'm a 1st-gen fan (yes, I'm very old) and since this DVD has been well-covered by other reviewers, I wanted to use this space to explain Davy's choice of ""Hitting The High Seas"".When this DVD was being produced, Davy was in the center of a protracted and one-sided snit with Michael Nesmith... seems the mystery surrounding Mike had drawn all the attention away from Davy, the self-professed heart-throb of the group, and Davy is not one who relinquishes attention easily. Its widely known that he chose this particular episode as his ""fave"" because Mike doesn't appear in it for more than 3 minutes!"
4,Monkee Memories are timeless,Just this four shows brought back a lot of memories of my youth.It was priceless to see the old ceral commercials that were smartly installed in the shows. I would like to see more of dvds with special shows because the box sets can be rather costly and it was nice to see the favorite shows of the funny four.I was able to see the Monkees on their 20th anniversary tour and if you would have told me when I was young I would have ever seen them in person I would not have believed it. That makes seeing these shows even more precious to my memories because I loved these guys so much I had all their records and as an adult have converted my collection to include all of their cds. I will eventually be able to add more of their dvds to my collections when I can. This is a nice sneak peak into my past loves lives. Thanks
5,Monkee Mayhem,"I am a first-generation Monkee fan and really enjoy escaping back to the funny stories and music of that time. I had a VHS tape that I taped from their run on television (like MTV), but this is trully a collector's item. I loved seeing the guys and hearing their comments on the stories. My favorite was ""Fairy Tale"". Mike really did a great job as Gwen."
1,Defective,Defective cable. Noticed that when one end was hooked up I could see the red light at the tip but the light was not bright enough to shine out of the cable. I used a 6ft Belkin cable I already had to confirm that it was the cable & not my TV/Receiver connection. Sending back and probably going to try and find another brand of 15ft+ cable.
5,Great watch,This is a beautiful watch of fantastic quality. My wife loves it. I purchased this watch because my wife and I have both had Seiko watches for over 25 years with no problems (mine is 28 years old and my wife's was 25 years old). I replaced her's because it had lost it's luster due to many years of exposure to dishwashing detergent. She never takes it off even in the shower or swimming.
1,No time,"I bought this watch in July 2006 and it failed to keep good time from the start. In November I mailed it to a jeweller through my Amazon warranty and it was returned with a card saying ""watch may be wound to increase power supply."" In other words, this automatic watch isn't automatic. I contacted Seiko and have now sent it to them for evaluation. They told me Amazon is not an authorized retailer of Seiko watches. I'm a fan of Seiko and have an old watch (#SWZ054) that works on a battery. Save your money on the automatic one."
5,Love it,"This is my third Seiko watch. Not because they have broken, but because I love Seiko. This gold tone watch is awesome. And the price was great. I would recommend it to anyone. Seiko is a great reliable company."
4,wedding songs,"if your looking for christian r&b wedding songs, this is the cd, used them at my wedding"
4,Elo Omega,"The album ""Elö Omega"" recorded by the group itself with rather primitive equipment during a tour, but the soundquality is very very clear!""Emlék"" is a truly lovely song, one of my favourite.Last track, called ""Varázslatos Fehér K"" is very very touching.Great live album! Recommend!"
4,Vidal's Perceptions and Skills Encapsulated,"The few reviews of this book already present when I wrote this covered the salient points well with one exception: ""The Ladies in the Library"" is not merely an example of evil in human relations but one of consummate horror in a vein that brings the Hitchcock masterpiece ""Psycho"" to mind."
2,Insufficient Information,"I agree with the former two reviews appearing here. In all fairness, the ad format does not allow room for exhaustive technical information. With that in mind, it would have been wise of the seller to at least include a means of technical assistance for pre-purchase contact.... I could not find anything on the page that would allow me to make an informed decision about purchasing this item. Information revealing species type, application rate, and expected coverage area would have been helpful, not to mention a guarantee for live delivery... The ""number of units left"" information is NOT sufficient evidence for me to justify a $50.00 expenditure."
5,Xam --I bought 4 test-prep books and passed all 4 tests!!!,"FTCE Reading K-12: teacher certification exam (XAM FTCE)I have bought 4 different test-prep boooks from Xam Publishing for subject area tests given by the State of Florida and I have passed all 4 exams with flying colors, as a result of my use of Xam's review books."
3,Not as accurate as most Seikos,"This is my third Seiko in 20 years, and maybe I got a bad one, but this one lost 2 minutes per month twice since I bought it. My other two Seikos were accurate to within 2-3 seconds per month. This may be a results of being battery-less, but for someone who works with high precision GPS instruments, it is not acceptable."
1,LOOKS GREAT BUT THAT'S WHERE IT STOPS,"THIS WATCH HAS NEVER WORKED AS IT SHOULD. NEVER KEPT GOOD TIME. CONSTANT RESETTING. NOW, AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR OF USE, IT HAS STOPPED COMPLETLY. WORST WATCH I HAVE EVER OWNED."
3,Gold already rubbing off,"Love the look and feel of this watch. But after wearing it for the last six months, the gold is already rubbing off on some of the links. I don't wear this watch daily so it's not even getting heavy usage. Also, because I don't wear the watch daily, I have to set the time and date frequently. That was to be expected, but just a little annoying. I really like this watch, but its wearability will end as soon as the gold rubbing off becomes too obvious. Pretty pricey for a watch I can't wear for a long time."
2,Below par for a Seiko,"I bought this after having had previous Seiko watches and like the quality and longevity.This one looked good on paper, but within a week the crystal face broke, starngely from the insode out, might have been a problem from manufacture, so had it repaired locally.Comparing the quality to my prevoi=ious watches this one looks and feels cheap, poor plating marks very easily.It has probably took the edge off Seiko for me anyway and probably wont buy another."
2,Power reserve is inadequate,"Though a fair preformer, the power reserve on the Seiko 5 7S23 movement is subpar, making the watch almost useless. Without the ability to wind from the stem (all 7S23's) the watch must be, ""swirled"" prior to any off wrist time exceeding a few hours. Accuracy was within spec, however waking up to a dead watch at least once a week has pushed me back to my $19 Casio. I would avoid this timepiece and all 7S23 (Seiko 5) products."
1,This is not a good watch,I should not have purchased this watch. It is not working properly. it does not work unless i shake it several times a day.Seiko has tried to copy Rolex and it is a very bad copy.
3,Keep it set to mountain time...,"Hey-o,Ron Burgundy here... this is the definitive watch of choice. No part-timers here, this is the real deal. Do you know how many Buick Regals a guy has to sell to afford this symbol of sexual status?? Many. Don't buy this watch unless you have the chest pubes to pull it off. Seriously, don't step up to the plate unless you're either Wade Boggs or you have a leather jacket. The device is an intimidator. It's not just a time-teller, it's jewlery. Alright, go eff yourself and get yourself a digital watch, you petunia."
5,Great x-mas gift,This was a x-mas gift for my husband. It keeps perfect time and he loves it. I would recommend this to anyone
4,Progressive rock needs not be in English,"Though most of my CD's are from the 70's and of English or American origin, I enjoy hearing other languages on a regular base: French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Hungarian. Idorablo from Omega is fine progressive rock of the milder type, and the ununderstandable strange Hungarian only adds to the mystical flavour. So far, each listening increased my liking."
3,About Zig Ziglar,"Before i start, id just like to mention that most of zig ziglars audios are very similar, they all have the same message, i heard Zig ziglar live in June, and i knew exactly what he was going to say, It seems to me that, zig has not changed his material over the many years he has been at the top, this audio recording is ok, but if you really want a good book, or audio by Zig Ziglar ' Over the Top is the one to buy, they all talk about motivation, and as zig says, you have to get rid of that stinkin thinkin, you have to become a meaningful specific. You only need ONE SUCCESS AUDIO, DONT FORGET ZIG IS A SALES MAN, SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POSITVE ATTIDUDE, COMMITMENT, AND DONT WASTE TIME AS TIME IS OUR BEST RESOURCE. ANOTHER THING, JIM ROHN IS VERY GOOD I HIGHLY RECOMEND HIM"
4,Excellent,I have had this phone for nine months and have had no problems to date. The range is good. The speakerphone is also excellent. My only problem is that it would have been nice if the phone had a clock on its display. Other than that it works excellent.
2,Great features - poor quality,"This phone has terrific features such as dual keypad on base and handset, speakerphone on base and handset, and most impressively caller ID windows on both the base and handset. However, the quality is very poor and it has some design flaws. The range is horrible - I was unable to walk outside without the phone cutting out for two or three seconds, and I could not walk to my mailbox without losing my call. Also, the phone does not rest well on its cradle which makes it nearly impossible to mount on the wall bracket. My first 1932 had to be returned within a week because it fell off of it's wall mount and the antenna broke (the antenna was in the down position and it still broke). All in all I was very dissapointed with this phone and with V-Tech customer service. I ordered this phone directly from V-Tech's web site and had many, many problems working with them. The great features aren't worth the faults of this phone."
2,2 sec. disconnection gaps,"I bought this product and right after installing it, on my first call I noticed there were gaps on the audio. I spoke to Manufacturer and they claim it is interference and should not place the base near any electronic equipment (my computer). Despite that my previous cordless phone worked in the same place until it died without interference, I changed the new one. It still looses the channel at 35 feet from the base. replaced it right away but same story..."
5,Another Great Score From Alfred Newman,"This imported CD version of The Robe is excellent. The score is in tact, not all cut up and edited. The tracks are in sequence with how they appear in the movie. The score is very lush and mesmerizing, perfect for this magnificent epic. Personally my favorite theme is the ""Diana"" / love theme for Marcellus and Diana."
5,"The ""Robe"" ost - worth the wait","At long last I now have the one score that has eluded me for years. The ""Robe"" as we know it is from a long line of biblical epics and also from Alfed Newman one of hollywood's great composers. The ""Robe"" is not too unlike the Newman/Herrmann collaboration the ""Egyptian and is a certainly one the great works. It is a pity however that the ""Crucifixion"" is one the missing tracks but nevertheless is a welcome addition to any soundtrack enthusiast. My vote 9/10 because of its originality."
3,it came on time,"it came on time, and was in good condition, for a record which i did not order. and yes my money is being refunded ."
3,great score ...but NOT what I listened to over the years,"When one has listened to has grown very familiar with this score from the Decca Relase of 1953, there's not much else to say. That LP recording had it all and it's too bad more research can't go into a project like this before an inferior product becomes available unnesessarily. I would say the same is true of The Ten Commandments as well ...and to some extent Ben Hur However, Ben hur still has some of the original material present. What does one do now exept wait. I guess it just proves that regardless of whatever new technologies our cultures embrace, we will always be somewhat doomed to an imperfect world."
2,not worth the money,"I bought this about a year ago and love the color and simple look. However, my Palm V slips out of it frequently and the front cover bumps against the buttons of my Palm when it's in my purse. This causes the Palm to start beeping and clicking, which is very annoying. Overall, it's like most of my shoes -- stylish looking and kind of expensive, but not real functional."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Poorly manufactured and substandard quality. I ordered this as a gift and, frankly, was embarassed."
3,I got a good two years out of it,"Well, I guess I'm in the minority here. I would say that for the price I paid ($350 with tax and delivery), I got a good two years out of this machine (and lost over 50 pounds) before it fell apart on me. Admittedly, I thought I'd get more time than this, and my original search on the internet was to find repair for the machine. Based on the reviews of others, I'd say that I am now looking to replace it rather than repair it. But... it was a good run."
1,save up and get something more solid,"i bought the machine about 14 months ago. broke down after 5 months of regular use, but to ""sears"" credit they sent a repairman to fix for free.after about another 5/6 months use (not even on a regular basis the axile broke again. I did some research on line and found an article that stated that the line of proform products are not built to last if they are used everyday or regularly, they are built for the causual exceriser --- i guess that explains it all."
1,Broken Prduct -- Terrible Customer Service!,We purchased a Proform elliptical several months ago... it took hours to assemble and then clearly had defective parts. It has been months of calls and complaints and the product is still not working (and we can't say the Proform people seem to really care)... avoid this company at all costs!
1,It broke within 6 months,I paid over $300 and the main axle broke in the first 6 months. Company said sorry 90 day gaurentee only. You can contact these companies and pay them to fix it.
1,Never buy Proform or any product associated with Icon Health & Fitness,Extremely disappointed! Don't be fooled by the good price and the no interest payment plan offered by Icon. They do not honor their 30 day money back guarantee.It was one problem after another. I rec'd a damaged unit. Then the console didn't work. Unit wouldn't turn off. Resistance motor quit working. You can't get a customer service rep when you need help. I left messages and sent emails. I was REFUSED 30 day money back guarantee. They sent a tech out 3 times to attempt to fix it. Tech contacted Icon and they couldn't help him. I had my elliptical four months before they decided to replace it. I had to file a BBB complaint to get a replacement unit. Rec'd replacement unit that doesn't work properly. Now customer service won't return phone calls or emails. I filed another BBB complaint.I bought this equipment 11 mos ago and it's only been usable for maybe 4 months.
1,Not good for long-term use at all,"I bought this machine from someone on CraigsList who purchased it direct and never used it. The first thing to go out was the digital console, then the fan, then the axel on the right side started giving away. I had it for 7 months before the axel for the right pedal broke completely. We tried to repair it, but to no avail. I am about 160 lbs. and used it for about 45 minutes 4-5 times a week during the time it worked. I doubt weight has anything to do with it, it is just a poorly manufactured piece of equipment."
1,Sad excuse for a movie....,"One of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie: low budget, unispired performances (Alexis Denisof is particularly bad here), lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon, bad direction, despisable characters, cliched situations... How Kinski chose to act in this one?!"
4,A unique and oddly pleasing film.,"Though I only watched it once, and I'd NEVER watch it again, it was a strangely odd but pleasurable experience. The actresses were pretty enough and leading man gruff as expected, not too much chemistry between the leads, but a lot of interesting plots and action. Good direction, but no sparks, yet i was on the edge of my seat, but for what, no great ending, but still i was on edge, there si a qaulity to the film work here and detail was taken seriously and the film is somewhat relaistic. I wish i hadn't bough and rented thsi instead but it was overall worth it, but I can't expalin why... it's a troubling mystery"
1,Forgettable....,"If you are willing to risk to watch this movie, just a warning: it's really a turkey, one of the BIG ones..."
1,Rip It Off rips a boring hole in the fabric of time.....,"There's a lot of things wrong with this movie....one being the wasted talents of its gifted cast. Nastassja Kinski (Cat People, One Night Stand), Alyson Hannigan (Boys and Girls, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Jennifer Esposito (Tv's Spin City, Master Of Disguise), Brian McCradie (Speed 2: Cruise Control), Steve Harris (Tv's The Practice, Minority Report), Todd Field (Stranger Than Fiction, Twister) and even the always awesome Alexis Denisof (Tv's Angel, Rouge Trader) are all burned out with a soggy script and its way too familiar and formulaic. It's about what adds up to be a bad bank robbery with everyone shooting each other up at the end. I really thought the accents of both McCradie and Denisof trying to do Russians was bad. McCradie is Irish isnt he and Denisof is like British..no, I'm not buying it for one second. Kinski, Hannigan and Esposito are all sexy but like I said....Not much fun...drags on a long time."
1,Simply unwatchable...,"Never could have guesse that this movie would be so bad. COuld not reach the end of it, a very rare occasion!! The dialogues are so ludicrous, characters and acting obnoxious, I can't, I repeat, I can't understand how Alyson Hannigan starred this piece of... Shame on me for being such a BUFFY fan and having the bad habit of renting / buying anything remotely related to the cast of BUFFY...."
2,A one time deal.,"Two stars only for the fact that Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisof were in the film. Besides that the movie was horrible. I found it hard just to pay attention. The only part of the movie that had an affect on me was when Alyson Hannigan's friend in the movie died and Alyson Hannigan was destroyed, the flashbacks of them were so heartbreaking. I felt Alyson's performance in that scene was the only thing that had me. Alexis Denisof's fake russian accent was atrocious.I rented the movie only for the fact that I saw Alyson Hannigan was in it. Being an extremely big Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel fan, I was ecstatic to read that Alexis Denisof was in it. But I must say, what a disappointment it was."
4,Fans of Live Greatful Dead music - you'll love this!!!,"I have to agree that this is not the finest of the ""Dick's Picks"" series (currently up to number 11) but it certainly deserves a 4 star rating, and it's a ""must have"". This is a great introduction to real, honest, live Greatful Dead --- that's actually been engineered pretty nicely right off the original soundboard masters. Dick's Picks are an awesome documentary of the music that the band was really all about, live music. Now... for the truly ""Deadicated""... get this one and the other 10 volumes (all 4 & 5 stars)... they'll really ""steal your face right off your head""!!!"
2,"Long, rambling and lacking focus","I would not recommend this CD for anyone who is not a dyed-in-the-wool ""dead head"". Based on the stellar recommendations below, I purchased it (having owned a number of Dead LPs in the past). I found the long rambling jams to lack focus. It seemed as if the players had fallen asleep and that their instruments played on without them. Then at some point, the band wakes up and decides, ""Oh yeah, we better change key and while we're at it, let's try to improvise another song to death"".If you want a Grateful Dead CD that is live but with a different edge, try Reckoning, where the music is played accoustically (Unplugged before that existed) and this tempers their tendency to try iprovising every possible combination of musical theme in each song, as they did on this CD.In summary, Great band, good songs, long unfocused jams that don't seem to go or get anywhere."
1,Dull,"Being new to the Grateful Dead these days can be rather daunting, they have so many albums and such a long history. I bought this album only after reading numerous reviews. What a huge disappointment!The tracks are weak and the arrangement of tracks is extremely poor -- they all run together and sound similar. I got tired of listening very quickly. This is an album that shows no depth, no intensity and very little diversity. I listened to it twice and that was all I could stand.Being new to the Dead and hearing such great things about them I wanted to like it, I really did. But after listening to Dicks Picks Volume 1 I can only conclude there is a reason the Grateful Dead existed as long as they did, produced as many albums as they did, and had as few hits as they did. Judging from this album, they're an awful band.Many people claim the Dead were a great live band. This album is far from it. If you're not a Dead fan already this album will probably ensure you never will be."
4,"""a music fan, indeed""","To the reviewer who calls himself ""a music fan"":You bought a Grateful Dead album, seemingly detirmined ahead of time not to like it, and then trashed it based on the one thing that sells it for true fans : the jams.If you don't like songs that ""run all together"" then don't buy a live album by a band known and revered for their ability to jam all night and just segue all the songs into that single jam. [....]"
4,Seemed like a strange place to start...,"The choice of music for the first Dick's Picks release was somewhat confusing for most Dead Heads I think. It IS good, and the sound quality is excellent - but I think most people's lists would have had other dates at the top. (Plus, it's edited a bit - a bass solo Phil Lesh didn't like was just faded out.) Is it worth listening to? Absolutely! The opening Here Comes Sunshine is worth the price alone... Steve Urbauer Stephen Urbauer"
4,Could be a lot better.,"The first in the Dick's Pick Series should be a lot better than this. That's not to say that it is bad, but it is a strange show. However, what makes this worth checking out is disc one. Two of the Dead's best (and least) played songs make up over 30 minutes of the first disc. Here Comes Sunshine and Weather Report Suite are both absolutely wonderful, which leaves one to wonder why the Dead stopped playing them. Disc 2 is weaker than disc 1, with the highlights being Stella Blue and He's Gone. This cd features yet another version of Playing in the Band, Truckin and the Other One, as if those songs aren't on enough cds already."
2,BORING! THERE ARE BETTER DICK'S PICK'S AROUND!,"I thought I was going to love this CD, and I must admit it was quite enjoyable for awhile. After listening to other DICK'S PICKS, however, I came to regard this as just a so-so show and nothing to get excited about. The long PLAYING IN THE BAND is good but lacks the feeling of other versions and just sounds like a guitar practice session rather than some of the mind blowing versions from other concerts. The highlight (to me) was the NOBODY'S FAULT> JAM > OTHER ONE > JAM > STELLA BLUE which has some nice moments. For some reason though I feel less inspired from this than other ""great concerts"" from this band. DICK'S PICKS 23, for instance, runs circles around the professional-sounding but somehow lacking sound on this CD that should be taken out of the series and forgotten at least for awhile until other deserving concerts can be appreciated first."
4,"Enjoyable, if unlikely, story with an ocean voyage & swordfights","Four guys in Paris must leave town for various reasons, and all end up living in Canada. Oh, and they're all in love with the same lady, who also winds up in Canada, too. Swordfights ensue. It's difficult to keep the characters straight at times, and a ""surprise"" twist at the end that was confusing, because it seemed obvoius early on...but still, an enjoyable read."
1,"not very comfy, caused pain to my foot.","I own a pair of Rockports and thought i can put in just some heel cushions to make it even more comfy. Big mistake! After like 2 hrs of walking the arch on my foot and ball of my foot started to hurt and ache. Walking became like a tedious chore and i wasn`t sure what was the problem until i removed them. I found out that the rockports where designed with some support for your foot originally in the shoe design, and raising the heel was a bad idea. Doing so left no support at all for your arch. So be careful when using these or any heel inserts that causes your heel to lift. if you have a higher quality shoe and want more cushion opt for the entire footbed (even the cheaper flat gel footbeds work great). that way it won`t just raise your heel but the entire foot is cushioned the evenly."
1,Another offensive turn of the screw,"Dershowitz argues that Jews ought to ""preserve themselves"" but not because they have been persecuted. After all, he implies, Jews are better than other people. As an oppressed woman, I do not feel the need to comment on the subtle racism/bloodline-ism in the text. I only urge him to turn his attention to more pressing matters than how wealthy and powerful Jews ought to remain ""untainted"" from other ethnic groups in the society in which they live. After all, he writes, he doesn't love his grandchildren any less because they are only half-Jewish. How big of him! How liberal! This man is a disaster waiting to happen. Try reading something more ecumenical. Try reading something with a heart for the common man."
4,Not what I wanted,I think the product is good but it wasn't exactly what my son wanted but it came in the time frame I was told and my son uses it but not as much as his other sticks.
4,I thought it was pretty good,"It wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it was a fun, fast read. I do have some complaints though. Beth was a really annoying character in the 2nd half of the book I thought, and the ending was very vague. For example, Amber and her best friend Kimberly apparently ""broke up"", yet there is no followup to that situation....the ending was very quick, not descriptive, and didn't tie up loose ends."
2,Not so great,"I've been wanting to read something from this author for awhile, and I was disappointed. I thought a lot of the dialogue was cheesy and the story was just boring."
1,Waste of attention,This book was a complete waste of time to read. It was not at all entertaining and took forever to get even to the mystery. SUCKS!
2,The worst of Graham?,"From the time I finished the first chapter I knew that this book wasn't going to do it for me. The main character annoyed the hell out of me with her repetative phrases and her 'sharp' speaking. I just couldn't get into the story, it wasn't interesting or compelling to keep me reading.I am a fan of Graham but this book took me by surprise since in my opinion it wasn't up to her usual storytelling standards."
2,Rambling and boring,"Not my usual read, but it sounded interesting. It was the usual genre, girl meets guy, thinks guy is a jerk, doesn't trust him, but he is a good guy in disguise. He saves her, she falls in love, etc. The plot could have been pretty good, but the book rambled on and on. There were too many characters, too much unneeded description. I had to force myself to finish it, skipping over parts the last half. But I was curious to learn who the bad guys were. Not very well written. Certainly not suspenseful with all the superfluous descriptions and assorted assignations, etc."
1,Don't bother!,I have read other Heather Graham books and they were light and entertaining. This book has no substance to it at all. Don't waste your time on the read there is no depth to the book at all. If this were her first attempt at writing she would have been told to find another career!
1,Rooting for the bad guys,"Characters in The Island are lacking such depth that it practically wants you to root for the bad guys. Seems like the author is writing for 12 year old girls, yet because of the adult situations, you know that's not true. If the setting had been an old haunted house, you would half expect to see the heroine walking backwards."
2,"""Predictable"", she murmured","I challenge readers of this book to count the number of times acharacter ""murmurs""---you will need all your fingers and toes and someone else's, to boot. Jeez, I imagine one would need a hearing aid if this was made into a movie.Besides the clunky writing, the story is the usual romance novel. I liked the setting though...."
1,Avoid this island!,"This book was not one of the author's best. There was practically no plot and not enough meaningful interaction between the two main characters. In fact, they barely spoke to each other. I still can't quite figure out if there was actually a plot. It felt like there were large pieces that were missing or edited out. The ending seemed rushed - like the author was just tying up loose ends (and there were plenty!) without actually explaining why anything happened. I'd say pass on this book or wait until it's on sale in paperback."
2,[...],"I have enjoyed most of Heather Graham's novels, but this one was just awful. The heroine was irritating, and there was no reason at all for any great, handsome guy to fall for her. I disliked her intensely. Unfortunately for me, I have this book on tape, so I couldn't just skip to the end and be done with it. I'll think twice before getting another book by this author before reading the reviews. [...]. Two stars only because I'm so in love with diving, and tropical islands. But that wasn't enough. This is a mind-numbing book that shouldn't have been written."
2,Phoning it in,"I read some Heather Graham books years ago and enjoyed their plotting and dialog. I bought The Island based on those older books. Unfortunately this book simply doesn't stand up. The plot is threadbare. The characters are irritating (yet another book in the stupid-heroine genre). Some of the dialog is just bad. The whole book wanders along aimlessly, then wraps up with a few pages of everyone suddenly acting decisive and heroic - way out of character. I'm afraid Graham phoned this one in, and her editor was out to lunch."
1,Just plain BAD!,"This was so bad I found myself laughing at times. The heroine was just ridiculous. I think if she wasn't so boring and just plain stupid I might not have thought the book was so awful.*POTENTIAL SPOILER*My favorite part was when she found out that the hero was undercover and her response was ""But why didn't he tell me?""I have read Heather Graham before and thought some were good - unfortunately, this wasn't one of them."
2,Horrible read,"Beth and her family are on an island for vacation, amongst other vacationers as well. She finds a skull hidden in the sand on the beach, and is very suspicious about this guy Keith and his buddies that are walking the very same stretch of beach.... and they're coming straight toward her and the spot that the skull was found.That's really all the farther I got in this one. The story just didn't hold my interest. Or rather, it might've if Beth wasn't freaked out about 'something' every-other second. She's too paranoid and too suspicious about what she found and started suspecting Keith and his buddies knowing or having something to do with the skull she found; and everything to do with who Keith was. It was just too dramatic and unrealistic for me.I thought this book would be a nice summer mystery I might dig into, but once I started, I knew it wasn't going to be as intriguing as I had hoped. I would say read another one. Anything by Lisa Gardner is worth the thrill."
2,Not worth the read,"In The Island Beth Anderson goes on a trip to a remote island near Florida with her brother and her nephew. She finds a skull there and gets all freaked out, recalling a story about a missing couple. This leads her to investigate the situation in what turns out to be a convoluted mystery.The Island is a very flawed novel. For one thing, none of the characters are all that interesting, and it's hard to care about them, in particular the love interest that Beth develops with the mysterious manly man Keith. The plot holes in the story are too numerous to mention. The tension never fully develops, or perhaps it didn't matter because I could not get myself to root for or against any of the characters. In the end, this is a very forgettable novel. I've read better from Heather Graham, and I would suggest skipping this one.Carl Alves - author of Blood Street"
5,Versatile and convenient,"Being very safety conscious, I've pasted this stuff all over my biking accessories: my helmet, my trunk bag, etc. It's great for creating extra visibility and is easy to cut to size and stick wherever necessary. Love this stuff!"
2,Half-assed as both an instructional video AND as a performance video!,"This video is a waste of money--it would even be a waste of money if it were $10.00, let alone the ridiculously high price of $26.99 that it is--grrrrr. When I saw that the video featured performances by Jack and Gary Moore, I thought it was going to be great! But the performances are just in some cramped little studio with goofy camera work and terrible mono sound. Right, not only is the sound not in DTS or Dolby 5.1, it's in MONO! Hello, what decade are you in, sound guys?? And the instructional/background part on Jack, is mildly interesting, but not really too in-depth. One funny part is when he explains the origin of the song ""N.S.U.""...hilarious! (I won't give it away here.)So overall, blah! A total ripoff...if you see it in some bargain bin for $3.00, then OK, but it's not worth much more than that."
1,Doesn't work with the E-115,"I got the Freedio printer after seeing it listed in the accessories catalog of my new E-115. After installing all the software, I couldn't get it to work and contacted Casio support. They informed me that it doesn't work with Pocket PC devices, because there is no task bar to activate the print routing from."
3,Publication printed on newsprint-quality paper,"Publication is older than I realized and is printed on low-quality, newsprint-quality paper which is significantly yellowed. Also, the emphasis appears to be on managing a genealogy project that is primarily on paper, rather than in electronic form. If I'd picked this book up in a used bookstore, I likely wouldn't have purchased it. Even so, there appears to be some content of relevance."
5,Wish I'd heard of them sooner,"This band has been around for a while but I have just heard of them this past two years. This is my second album of their's and I have been satisfied with them both. They seem to change their sound up a bit from song to song and from album to album. This is not necessarily so bad, because no matter their ""mood"" or what-have-you, I'm still interested.So, Three thumbs up to not only the Album but the band ""Straitjacket Fits""."
1,Almost unlistenable,"Not a single track that I enjoyed. Hard to understand glowing reviews of this NZ band. I've also listened to the follow up album and that's even worse. If you want seminal NZ pop/rock; stick with the Bats, Chills, Sneaky Feelings, Verlaines, etc. Stay away from this."
5,Scarily Relevant today,"This book was written during the Reagan years, and even-handedly cuts through partisan baloney, attacked both conservatives and liberals where they should be attacked.The false left/right paradigm that we were entrenched in in 1987 still has just a strong a grip on our nation 20 years later, and it's a shame this book is not still in publication."
3,A bunch of one liners.,"The book has some good ideas, but it is full of one liners. It gets boring at times.On the good side - you have a lot of one liners to say and put on posters."
5,Legend with legacy,"More companies shopuld give this book out to their managers and forces them to read this. Sic sigma is important. Lean management is also important. However, John Wooden had it as thay would say at the time, ""Right on!"" Winning is important, Teaching gets you there!!"
4,Leadership Rooted in Success,"John Wooden is a reluctant legend, but a legend nonetheless. His leadership practices are pillars that support sustainable success in leaders. If you're wondering how to be an inspired leader in this sea change or perfect storm, read Wooden on Leadership. His leadership tenets are grounded in what I know for sure: Who you are as a leader is who you are as a person."
5,Good find!,"When I couldn't find this book at any others stores, of course my go to was amazon.com. My husband quite enjoyed this book as it was a gift for him."
5,"Amazing man, amazing book","After reading this book, it is clear to me all that it takes to be a leader. It brings to light so much more than most people think. I believe that all of his topics and ideas are essential to be a leader if to varying degrees. Obviously not all of his ideas and tactics are useful to every organization, however the foundation of ideas and values he lays down are powerful tools to the modern leader in all situations."
5,An excellent book on leadership,"As a relatively new supervisor for a major corporation, this book had a profound effect on me.Coach Wooden explains the core principles of what makes a great player/employee. More importantly, he explains the principles you need to be a great leader/teacher. I immediately overhauled my supervisory style as a result of reading this book, incorporating much of Wooden's philosophies, and the results were immediate and substantial.I plan to re-read this book regularly."
2,bad quality sound reproduction & undeletable faxes,"This machine is easy to use and has a good quality cordless phone. The quality of the little computer chip which records the incoming messages is not good, however, and many times messages are totally indecipherable. Tapes are far better than chips.My main beef with this machine which drives me crazy is that you cannot delete faxes from the memory. So if someone sends you an unwanted 20 page fax while you're out - even when there is no paper in the tray - it gets stored in the memory and the only way you can get it out of the memory is to print it. Turning the machine off does delete it. You can waste a [money amount]cartridge just clearing the memory of your machine. Cartridges are [spendy] and print surprisingly few pages."
1,8 inch carbide circular saw blade,Not too happy! I ordered a combination blade but got a rip blade. I have some use for the rip blade so will keep it.
5,I ordered the set before I knew the episodes that were included,"This is a great television series! I love it! These four episodes are a good variety. I am more of a fan of Mike so I like that fact that there are 3 episodes featuring Mike ( Laserblast, Werewolf and Future War) and one episode with Joel ( First Spaceship to Venus). Of the four my favorite is Werewolf because of the cheesy acting and the random foreign accent of the main female character ( Paul is you a Verevolf??). Laserblast is also really funny because of the two policemen who try to go after the main chracter. Highly reccommend you will not be sorry!"
4,Must have for anyone that likes MST3K,This is a great set. The production value is the best of any of the volume releases. What makes the 20th Anniversary set a step above the normal release? The three part documentary is well worth the price alone. The small Crow is too cute for words. My hope is they make another release like this and include the rest of the crew. He seems so alone :( The only thing I missed where the lack of shorts.
5,A must for Msties,These are great fun and the bonus stuff is excellent. The only downer is there isn't much Joel stuff. Not that Mike is bad but only 1 movie is Joel it would be better to have a balance
5,Nice set for MST3K fans!,"As a MST3K fan, i'm glad to see they are still going to continue releasing these 4 movie sets. I won't be the only one to admit that you can't get enough of this show. It IS, no doubt, one of the best shows and has one of the most loyal fan bases of any show out there. This 4-disc set features 4 GREAT episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and includes Laserblast, Werewolf, Future War, and First Spaceship on Venus. Special features include ""The Oral History of MST3K"" feature in three parts, 2008 Comic-Con MST3K Reunion Panel, featuring Joel Hodgson, Mike Nelson, and more, original film trailers, ""Variations On A Theme Song""Limited-edition version comes in a tin box with 4 lobby cards and a figurine of Crow T. Robot, all exclusive to this set.BUY IT NOW!"
4,Good selections for MSTies,"Not the best of MST3K, but a great group of films in true MST style. If you miss those weekend showings on TV, this is a wonderful opportunity to kick back and laugh along with Mike and the gang at some of the worst films ever made."
5,super silly show,This show is the best. I remember laughing so hard. I make cry to this every time. Get this product. Right now.
1,Poorly Designed,I ordered two of these... Both tins were damaged under the wrapping (meaning they left the factory that way). The DVDs are crammed into the tin and you have to pry them out -- I damaged one DVD box trying to get them out.I'm not a happy camper.
3,Fans... you will enjoy!,My sis and I loved watching these together! All of the movies are laugh out loud funny. I loved that they all came in a box together to keep it all organized. I was a little disappointed with the different hosts. I'm a fan of Mike but not the other guy. All in all a great buy and a fun watching experience for a rainy day!
1,just bad,"Some movies are bad but funny because of how bad they are. This one is just slow, boring, and I got tired of watching it."
4,MST3K Carried on with Rifftrax,"These are 4 very good titles -- though none are my favorites. I'm particularly interested in the tin! For those MST3K fans, check out ""Rifftrax"", which are downloadable comment-tracks that you can synch up with popular movies. I've watched a handful and loved them."
2,Moderately interesting but not great,"I was intrigued by this subject matter. Unfortunately, each segment is five minutes or less so it's not all that interesting. It makes good background noise, at least."
4,Must have for crime history and excellent value and length...,"This dvd really blew my mind. To my knowledge the creators are an independent film copany, but one of the best at making documentaries. The length if this 2 dvd set is far worth the price. It delves into mysteries concerning crime, american history, mysterious occurences, and even babe ruth. It could have been better if some cases were given some extra details, but it just makes you want to look it up yourself. Dont hesistate, make it a part of your documentary collection."
4,Okay shoe,Nothing special about this shoe other than it is a silver flat. I do like the ornament on the toe of the shoe. Hope it doesn't fall off!
5,wow! :),"I loove these shoes! I wanted them this summer but they were $80 at Macy's and never were going to go on sale. I got them though at Amazon for about $25 in august, perfectly in time for my september 1 wedding. they looked so cute peeking out from under my dress. however I think they run slightly small because I got an 8 and normally i wear 7.5 or even 7 in Nine West, and i had to wear them with big socks on for a couple days at home to stretch them out. they did stretch though with no problems and are now very comfortable. they are much cuter in person than the picture (i have the silver ones - not sure about other colors). Ive only worn them once so i cant say anything about durability. but they are soo nice - the plastic on top has little cyrstals on it and it looks like chunks of ice. very modern looking, i think. I love Nine West."
5,GOOD CROSSOVER!!! AMAZING!,"Listen. People bad talk Pyle, and I know why. It's because shipping amplifiers is hard business. They come broken due to shipping, not due to Pyle.As an honest, gifted, educated individual. My Pyle amplifier works great, and my crossover works even better.I bought this used from amazon.com. VERY HIGH QUALITY VERSATILE EQUIPMENT. One input can branch to 3 different RCA combinations and 3 different TRS 1/4 options! WOW! ... WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All stereo, all high quality, all effective.Turns right on. Light weight, strong design. I need this originally for a subwoofer low pass filter. Well now I have my whole system custom tuned and effects running out of 6 different channels to 8 different amplifiers! The combinations are endless with piggy backed cables.Two year warranty, amazon credibility... BUY NOW! BUY NOW! BUY NOW!"
4,Great product,"I find this a great product. I used to ahve a low-line Dual, and I never had a clean bass sound. Now it is crisp, and I just love the sound quality. The only problem that I have is the lack of some really sweet features like the USB, and it only has a 3-band EQ. the screen is not really hi-res, but looks very cool. I am overall very happy with this product."
5,The best Soundtrack from the best Movie.,"Just like the other who watch the movie, I feel great excited. I like soundtrack, but I love this soundtrack most."
3,Speed Score Not That Bad,"Speed was an excellent movie. The score puts you right there in the bus with Jack and Annie. Unforturnatley, the score was not the best. I gave it 3 stars because most of the songs are no longer than a minute. The good ones are Main Title, The Gap, City Streets, and End Titles. They are all pretty good though, although those are the best. This isn't a must have, but if you're a Speed fan, buy it anyway and tell the rest of us what you think."
3,"Not Mancina's Best, but not too bad.","Mancina's work on this score was perfect for this paticular movie. I would disagree with his decision to put in a lot of the synthesized sounds you hear throughout the score. The opening titles and rush hour track are among my favorite on the CD. If you are a Mancina fan, I would recommend buying this one."
3,reiki for beginners:,"i do have to agree with mr. clayton above ...to a point. i have in my personal collection many reiki titles..and i think whatever we read and the info included ..is within our own personal interpretations. i think the author above ideas are great, because they click with me personally and with the stories of those in it make it worth while. i dont know alot of the buddhist concepts spoken of..only they also click with me. thats all that counts in the end. the author does all service by his writings, as does all those who dare to write about another ""controversial"" topic for whinney humans. peace be."
4,A Very Good Introduction,"Like most metaphysical studies, Reiki, has many different schools of thought. Since I am preparing to take a Reiki I & II class this upcoming month, I wanted to learn as much as possible about Reiki. For that, I thought Mr. Venells book to be a good starting block. No, it doesn't tell you anything, but, then again, it isn't designed to be the ""end all"" guide to this practice. The very title says ""for beginners."" This means, people like myself, who are learning more about Reiki will find this book to be helpful. I thought the author did a very good job about explaining the basics of reiki, and his list of resources, while somewhat incomplate, gave a helpful next step."
2,I should have bought a different book,This book was packed with filler and not much information. Being brand new to Reiki and knowing little about it I did learn a little something which is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars. If I had been more experienced or knew more about Reiki to begin with then the book would have been a real waste of time. Now that I have read this book I may as well donate it somewhere because I don't see needing to refer back to it again. Do yourself a favor and invest your money in another book that will give you a bigger picture.
2,Need Updating,"In the past, certain things like the Reiki symbols are kept secret, so like this one, they're never mentioned. But learning the reiki symbols are highly important so, I'd recommend other books and dvd's which contain them, such asReiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should KnowReiki the Ultimate Guide Vol. 5 Learn New Psychic Attunements to Expand Psychic Gifts & HealingReiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 4 Past Lives & Soul Retrieval Remove Psychic Debris & Heal Your Life (Reiki - The Ultimate Guide)Reiki The Ultimate Guide, Vol. 2 Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras, plus New Reiki Healing Attunements for All Levels (Reiki: The Ultimate Guide)Reiki 1st Level Attunement Become a Reiki Healerand more.This book needs updating."
1,"Great case, but not for 3C","This is a quality case for PDAs, soft leather, a feeling of durability. I would definitely recommend it over the cheaper cases you see everywhere. BUT, it is too small for the Palm IIIc, vertically, with either the top or the bottom of the unit sticking out, defeating the goal of protecting this particular unit."
1,Does not show how to play pandeiro at all,"They guy is just having fun with friends, and there is no serious instruction,nothing .. I am happy that I rented it and not bought it.Eu toco pandeiro, e eu esperava muito mais do Carlinhos .. this is a shame."
3,BETTE DAVIS IN HER FIRST STARRING ROLE!,Davis looks sensational as a free-spirited designer who does'nt believe in marriage! This is actually a lame little melodrama and I agree agree with the other reviewer in that the film's only claim to fame is that it's the first film with Davis's name above the title. Barbara Stanwyck starred in the same essential story only two years prior in Illicit!
5,Smashing & Brutal Satire of England's Idle & Shallow Rich!,"I admit I'm new to Mr. Waugh,but no doubt he was among the greatest prose fiction satirists of all time! This beautifully written novel is and will always remain a classic, and is a real page turner even though there's no mystery or suspense. Every line is a gem, from the architectural descriptions to the cutting dialogue. In this world practically everyone is a useful ornament for someone else, afternoon luncheons and evening parties are about the only thing of note, and children are there to be looked after by the servants. In this book, the most likable character is indeed the young boy, who is completely frustrated and bewildered by nearly all the ""grown-ups"" he meets.And the final trip to the ""lost city"" in South America, with the truly bizarre Dickens buff, neatly concludes this grand slam of a book!"
3,A Good Novel,"This is a work that captures an important juncture of the English novel. It has a tinge of seriousness, which often is uncommon to Waugh's books. The book also contains all of his usual insight and sharp use of language. I greatly enjoyed reading this one."
4,"good communication, nice vintage product",seller communicated problem in shipping time and was quick to resolve problem. my book arrived just when she said it would. the protective slip cover on the book was a little damaged but the hard cover book itself looks great and matches the image seller provided.
4,World Between the Wars Satired,The story of Lady Brenda and Mr. Tony Last in 1930's British society. A stinging satire of the upper class in the time between the two World Wars.
3,Sample only contains Introduction!,If you like to sample books (and who doesn't?) then be warned: this edition of A Handful of Dust has a long introduction that takes up all of the sampling space Amazon provides. Go to the bricks and mortart library and read the first few chapters if you don't want to commit to buying this book sight unseen.
4,The Descension of Decadence,"The author paints a poignant tale of immorality, Carnality, and Sordidness. The book teaches one of the hollow and shameful lives most of the wealthy live. Caught up in selfishness and materiality; they breath only to sate themselves. The top antagonist, Brenda Lost is one of the most loathsome characters I have ever read about. This story was published in the 1930's. However, it is as elucidating about today's world as it was then."
4,A life-long loathing of Dickens?,I've just learned he really didn't like Dickens ... Very significant for one of the two endings chosen ...
3,"good beginning, unconvincing ending","I really liked the beginning of the story and the description of the collapse of Tony and Brenda's marriage along with the gossiping that flourishes around it. A real piece of good writing and a keen eye on society and on hypocritical behaviour in general. However, I did not like the second half. I know that Waugh had his reasons to write the book as he did and that he wanted to convey a certain meaning. Nontheless, I did not like it. A great pity, because it is a beautifully written and well structured book with a sweet, endearing heroe one can't help pitying and loving. I wished Waugh had planned a more plausible ending for his Tony Last, granted that he wanted to have him die in the end. But why in the jungle???? He just spoiled the whole story."
2,Not his best by far,"I have read ""Brideshead Revisited"" and admired it greatly. I thought the characters complex and the insights into English society so lucid and complete that I felt that I could understand their motivations and wants.However ""A Handful of Dust"" is much more opaque. The characters are loathsome, without any redeeming qualities usually present in his other books. The book is sardonic and dry to the point of being sere. It is so arch that it becomes wearisome, a farce of malice and well-written cruelty.As usual the ending is anti-climactic, another flawed tying-up of loose ends. Waugh, though entertaining, is not one of the century's great novelists."
2,Satire is Supposed to be Funny,"Although this book is very well written as are all of Waugh's books, it is more invective than satire. Who cares about these people. Spend your time reading some Dickens---over and over again if necessary."
3,My first read for Waugh,"... and I have The Loved One which I wish now I'd read first. I'm the type to give any book a chance, but this book was just so far-fetched that the plot couldn't hold my attention. I'd pick it up and read for a while, then I'd think of something better to do and lay the book back down. If I'm into a story this doesn't usually happen. So why, if I felt that way, did I give it a 3-star, or average? Well, I guess because I thought the writing was good, it flowed well, it was just so ho-hum. If this is supposed to be satire at it's best, then I guess I've missed the boat somewhere along the way. I'll give The Loved One my next Waugh effort and hope the reading improves. At least that book is a short read if it doesn't."
2,I totally agree with any of the negative points made so far,"Having read The Loved One last term I was glad to see another Waugh on our reading list but A Handful of Dust did not meet my expectations at all. As one of the previous reviewers stated it is really only worth being read as a classroom assignment but never worth being read for personal entertainment. The beginning is clumsy and stretched and although the middle part is entertaining at some place it's still boring on the whole. From the point on when Tony sets foot on Brazil ground you can forget about reading on. Nothing of any value to the reader happens, the plot becomes not only even more boring but terribly far fetched and I'm sorry to say that I don't think the irony or satire whatsoever intended comes across."
3,you may need patience,"I have been using rodney yee's videos over the last 2 years and was excited to try this new yoga system. I have to admit I was pretty disappointed the first time I used the system. It was basically just laying on your back with the balls underneath. I had my husband try it out to see if it was worth keeping. He seemed to enjoy it more than I. I kept at it and I am seeing progress. It seems to work best in conjunction with Mr. Yee's other videos. It is a good ""cool down"" option for getting at those hard to reach areas that hold tension."
3,yoga balls,"the 2 small yoga balls never stayed inflated, but the medium one is good. rodney yee is a great leader"
3,Good for the extended version,"The Tracklist for this cd is1. Emergency on planet earth2. Emergency on planet earth (extended version)3. If I like it I do it (live)4. Revolution 1993 (demo)The reaosn to get this cd is for the the extended version of Emergency on planet earth which adds a bit mor eintro, and If I like it I do it (live)which is another funky live song which are found on the early singles. Revolution 1993 is bad, at over 10 minutes its long and distorted and not worth a listen."
4,"Great content, but in some need of editing","This book lives up to its claim to be a definitive history of the P-38 Lightning. Not being any more of aviation buff than Walter Mitty, I learned a very great deal both from the text and the pictures, and I still return to the book for reference. It can be recommended without hesitation, but with a warning that it could have been made easier to read by better editing and layout. Things that I would have liked to see, besides fewer typos, include a diagram of the plane with its visible exterior parts labeled, and better anticipation of questions that occur to readers as they wade through the text, such as what are the features that distinguish at a glance the F type plane from the J type, etc. It's true, the answers are all there or can be inferred by study, but not every reader may be as willing as I was to tease the story out. I'm glad I did!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"One of the great albums of all times. Whether you like Jazz, classical, folk or rock this album, full of both classic and unusual Louis Armstrong tunes is a must have."
5,brenda rocks!!,i was blown away by brenda's music....its so real and full of expression! crazy happy is one of the best cds i've ever heard! buy this cd! :)
1,Totally mislead about application,"I purchased this item under the impression that it would fit my Paasche air brush. NOT!!! Nor will it fir my Badger air brush. When I contacted the company about it, I was, for all practical purposes, told ""tough luck""I realize it is only a few bucks, however, because of the attitude displayed by their customer service I will NOT deal with this company again and strongly recommend the same to anyone."
1,Not practical or wearable,"I'm so disappointed in this product. I searched for a thong bodysuit for ages with the intent of wearing it under all types of clothing including jeans and summer dresses. The bottom of this is fine but the bra part has such thin coverage that it's of no use. I could only wear this with very heavy shirts or sweaters--no t-shirts or thin tops unless I want the outline of everything showing. For $75 it's a major disappointment. If it were half that I might keep it to wear very occasionally. As it is, it's going back."
5,No more love handles,"I love the firm control and the thong, so there's no panty-lines or thigh-lines. It is nice to wear under regular every-day clothes as well as dress-wear. I highly recommend this product if you'd like to smooth yourself out under your clothing. Everything just wears better when this is under it, with no love handles popping out! I own it in nude and I'm going to purchase it in black too."
2,Not Hot,"Squeezes all over, gives you a wedgie, doesn't flatter the bust, husband said it looked like something for an old lady, Not Hot!"
3,Needs support,The concept of this item is great however it needs to be made either with out the under wire so you could wear a bra with it or made with the underwire and padding. I can not go without padding in my bra so I have a hard time wearing this product.
1,I don't like the service.,"I still didn't get my order till now, I sent out an email, no one get back to me, Im about to call my bank to get my refunds, its been almost a month now."
5,Hungarian symphonic (prog) rock,"In Hungary they nearly know Solaris, although they excist nearly 20 years. This 1990 double (cd) album is just great. Great in music, in feeling. If you want to dream away to the future (Los Angeles 2026) listen to that piece of music. You hope the future will sound like that kind of music. The double cd contains pieces from different years, which are combined in this set. Pieces they used in other albums like The Martian chroncles. You can't hear the differences when the numbers are made. They are very good (classical) instrumentalists. In 20 years they only made so far 3 albums (Martian chronicles, 1990 and Nostradamus), 1 live (Live in Los Angeles) and last year the official bootleg serie. This one you should buy and the rest will follow (like I did)."
4,Christmas Gift for 2 1/2 year old boy,Our grandson has played with this toy for hours. He has found a multitude of things in his home to interact with it. His mother is very pleased with the toy. It has sparked his imagination!
2,disappointing,i bought this item as a gift & i was v disappointed by the lego pieces it had. there were just 12 pcs for $10 & even those were no fun to assemble & play. i wont recommend anyone to buy it.
4,Underrated score,"David Newman doesn't get much attention in Hollywood as his brother Thomas. David has many good works out there yet to be discovered or even released on album.This is a good score that - thank God - got released. Many might recognize the main trumpet theme from movie trailers for which it's mostly used in. The theme is typical David employing his signature elongated single, high trumpet blasts. Extra music from the original trailer release is also on the album. The songs are arranged out of chronological order but it helps with the listening experience.There's plenty of music and for the asking price it's a worthy buy. The theme alone is enough to justify its purchase. For a militaristic fanfare plus score, check out OPERATION DUMBO DROP."
2,not worth the money,"This case offers only a little more protection than the case that comes with the Casio E-125. The same rigid cardboard-like material is sewn into the case to protect the screen. There is no extra padding. The soft leather is nice, as are the properly spaced holes so that you can use the PDA while it is in the case. But the added bulk of the case makes it impossible to fit the PDA into a jacket or shirt pocket. The little case that comes with the E-125 fits snugly around the PDA so that it still fits into these pockets."
5,THE BEST!!! No matter what any one else says.,"I don't know how people can sit here and say that this wasn't that great of an album. Sure 'Rumours' was great but this was the first, and I could only think of MAYBE one song that isn't so great. What I'm saying is that it would be hard to beat this!"
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!,"While ""Rumours"" is often considered Fleetwood Mac's masterpiece, ""Fleetwood Mac"" (the first album featuring Buckingham and Nicks) is actually superior, featuring just as many FM radio classics, a less-acidic tone, and just plain catchier songs. Lindsay Buckingham displays all of his pop brilliance on ""Monday Morning,"" and all of his paranoia on ""World Turning"" and ""I'm So Afraid."" Stevie Nicks offers her biggest hit (""Rhiannon"") and her best song (""Landslide""). And Christine McVie is well represented by what may be her greatest pop masterpieces (""Over My Head"" and ""Say You Love Me"").""Rumours"" is great - but this is better."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I guess I ordered by mistake, I wanted Rumours and for some reason thought this was Rumours plus. Only recognized a few songs."
4,Was this supposed to be a double disc as well?,"I am a bit confused by the packaging for this collection. Unlike the other two remasters of Rumors and Tusk, FM is a single disc, with the bonus tracks tacked onto the end. If you look at the art on the disc itself, it says ""Disc One"" in bold letters. Was a second disc planned but scrapped?But as far as the remasters go, the other two are better albums. Tusk has some odd audio glitches though."
3,Hits Plus Filler,"If you've heard Rhiannon and Say That You Love Me, there's not much else to this album. Well, Landside is very nice (much better than their later version on The Game) and Warm Ways is gushingly beautiful. But the rest if less cohesive and more exploratory. Rumors mines the same territory with better results."
3,Great album; lousy remastering,"I have to make these same reluctant but truthful comments regarding the remastered versions of Rumours, Tusk and the epynomous album: The remastering of these terrific albums, which was badly needed, is a real disappointment.I have a decent stereo (NAD S500i CD player, NAD S300 integrated amp, Dynaudio Contour 1.3 Mark II speakers and a Velodyne FSR-10 sub), and most well-done remasters sound wonderful on it, but these three recordings are extremely bright and sibilant; harsh really.Also (and I think this is part of the original production), the lead vocals are recessed and muffled; always just lurking in the background, never up-front where they belong. Almost like Stevie or Christine is standing in another room or facing away from the mike. The exact opposite of a modern production, like Norah Jones, where you can virtually see her standing in front of you.I can barely listen to these albums, they're so bright."
5,Got what I wanted.,"I only bought this to get the ""single version"" of Say You Love Me"" with all the heavy guitar. Loved it."
5,Stevie Nicks puts Mac over the top,"There were Fleetwood Mac albums before this one, but not with Stevie Nicks. This was their breakout album, and their best ever. Mac had a lot of good material later, but this one had the power of a volcano. It includes my favorite Fleetwood Mac song of all time, in the running for my favorite song by anyone ever, the original Landslide. Stevie also did Rhiannon, a classic. Meanwhile Christine McVie recorded the haunting and beautiful Over My Head and Warm Ways."
3,Vintage Fleetwood Mac,"I so love to read critiques by the goofballs who think they know music better than the artists. Where do you people come from? This album is as good as anything FM ever did. To refer to Lindsay and Stevie as failed artists is a laugh; more likely failed Mick, John and Christine.....they were nothing without Buckingham's guitar and Nick's voice."
3,Haven't Hit Their Stride,"Not their worst but not quite Rumours or Tusk, either. Buckingham still trying to get a feel for this band. In comparison to the other Mac albums in my collection, this one rarely gets played."
3,Amazingly Shoddy Remastering,"Looks like I spoke too soon when I wrote my last review; after listening to this CD more thoroughly, I actually found that most tracks sounded better on the original CD, rather than this remaster. Yes, ""Blue Letter"", ""Crystal"", ""Say You Love Me"", ""Landslide"" and ""World Turning"" sound better on this remaster, but everything else sounds worse - often clearly worse (""Warm Ways"" in particular sounds disappointingly dull and flat).I was shocked to find that the stereo image on ""Sugar Daddy"" and ""I'm So Afraid"" wondered all over the place. This wasn't the case on the original, and is something you wouldn't expect to hear on even the crappiest CD. It shows that no care was taken with this remaster - the better sounding tracks are probably just a fluke.I am simply amazed that anyone involved could have let such a shoddy remastering of such a well-known album be released."
5,A must for any Fleetwood Mac fan.,"Monday Morning, Landslide, World Turning, and I'm So Afraid (my personal favorite)... this album is a true gem that stands out in my vinyl collection. As a longtime Rumours fan, I just recently gave this a listen online and loved it instantly (if not more than) Rumours. This just so happened to have come into my life at a most interesting time as well, creating an even deeper appreciation for the musicianship, lyrics, photography, etc. that went into the making of this."
4,The Other Classic Fleetwood Mac Album,This was Fleetwood Mac's first album with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. It was a roaring success that gave them 3 top twenty singles and a #1 album. This album features Buckingham's trademark arrangements and Stevie Nicks breaking out with her gypsy-witch persona on the classic Rhiannon. This lineup of the group was magic onstage and in the studio and set the stage for their epic-blockbuster Rumours. It's a great place to start for both casual fans and fans of soft rock in general. The whole group shines on this one and you won't be disappointed. The remastering job on this is first-rate. Highlights:RhiannonOver My HeadCrystalLandslideWorld TurningI'm So AfraidAll of these are also concert as well as radio staples. You can't go wrong with this one.
3,A good additional for any real fans of the Mac,"I bought this CD specifically for 'Monday Morning' and the original rendition of 'Rhiannon' and I was not dissapointed. While this isn't their *best* work in my opinion (See 'Rumours' for that!), the music is great...as I say in the title, a good additional for any true fans of Fleetwood Mac!"
4,Ditto.,"I second the sentiments of the August 25th fan below regarding Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The fact of the matter is that this band goes down in history BECAUSE of the addition of these two creative artists. Anyone who refers to them as ""failed musicians"" simply posts his ignorance up in neon for all to behold. Let's put it this way: Mick Fleetwood and John McVie had been at a while, going through the likes of Jeremy Spencer, Peter Green, anyone remember Bob Welch?, while Lindsay and Stevie had just started out. This album started it all. Not as many powerhouse songs as ""Rumours"", but still very good."
5,This is FM's best album,"I've long thought that the commercial sucess of Rumours, was because this album was so darn good. Everyone loved this one, and bought Rumours before they had even heard it. Rumours is great, this is better!"
3,The First By The Classic Combo,"This is the first album with the addition of Buckingham and Nicks. Not quite up to the standard of later and greater works such as Rumours or Mirage. The three songwriters are still feeling out their personas and, while there are a number of hits on this album, feels a bit awkward."
3,"Yin and Yang, man, Ying and Yang....","This is about as ""70s"" as music gets -- when I listen to it, I can almost feel the thick shag carpeting between my toes. ""Monday Morning"" is neat, as is ""Landslide"", but much of it is just drippy 70s SoCal voodoo nonsense (""Crystal""), or paperthin, ""I'm-OK-you're-OK"" pop ditties that are just this side of elevator musak (any song by Christine McVie). The end result is equal parts pleasant and tacky -- just like the decade it was recorded in."
2,VERY expensive locations,"I was looking for a spot to host an informal event, and it seems that most of the locations recommended here cost at least $700. Which is all right if you're planning a state dinner, but don't spend your money on this guide if you're planning anything cheaper than black-tie."
2,OK,"This book certainly has a lot of different reception locations, but it could be one-quarter of the size if it didn't keep repeating the same locations 2,3,4,5,6 times in the same book (just in different section)! The reviews were also very blunt with no real description of the location. The author also gives only flattering comments to every location, some of which turn out to be no so nice at all!"
2,Intenet Wins and Free!,"I was disappointed in the book because of the duplications throughout. Most entries I had already come across on the web. It's also missing a big chunk of the wedding market that resides in the Frederick, Maryland area. It makes me wonder if this isn't just advertisements for those who were willing to pay to have their businesses listed."
4,"Cute, rhyming book!","The bright, colorful pictures and the rhyming of this book are cute and entertaining for a variety of children age groups."
5,Perfect bedtime story,"Fantastic book! Large pages (hardback book is 9x11 inches) with bright and colorful illustrations. There is SO MUCH to see on each page. It's very entertaining even as an adult to see what each character is doing as the story progresses. The rhyme and flow of the words is soothing and easy to read. A sample page: ""Cars sway on the wooden track. Wheels go click. Wheels go clack. Glide across a plain so flat. Gently toss this way and that. Clickety-Clack! Clickety-Clack! Clickety-Clack!"" We bought this because my then-2 year old son loved trains, but our daughter is now that age and she loves the story just as much, even without a train fascination. A favorite bedtime story for both kids (now 4 and 2)."
5,Good night train,I bought this book for my 3-year-old grandson for Christmas because he loves trains and he loves other good-night books we have. He enjoys the colorful illustrations with all the detail the artist has put in and liked the story idea of the kids on board fluffing their pillows and sleeping on the train. This is definitely a good book for young children who love trains. Only problem is that now he wants me to take him on a sleep-over train ride!
1,Don't waste your time on this book!,"I purchased the Kindle version of this book and it is horribly done. You can't even properly read the story and show your child the pictures. My daughter, 2.5 yrs old, was so disappointed in the delay of my reading and the confusion. There were multiple pages on each Kindle page, then repeat pages in poor quality. The words on the pages can't really be read and they have typed the words out for you to read under each scan of the book pages, but even those are confusing. It is exactly like the read it now ""preview;"" which I thought was just an issue with the preview. Otherwise this is an awesome story and I would love to buy it in the hardback version. My daughter loved the idea of a train going night night."
5,Such a fun book!,I love children's books. They are a hobby of mine. This one is a real gem. It's a perfect read-aloud before bed...it even made me sleepy reading it. :) The soothing rhythms and beautiful pictures make this a great addition to any children's library.
5,Beautiful Illustrations,"My twin two-year-old sons love this book. They request it for story time before bed nearly every night. The illustrations are beautiful and so intricate that the boys find something new to look at every night. Some of the images are silly, like a pig dressed as a porter taking a bubble bath in a bath shaped train car. At first, I thought it wouldn't keep their attention because it was whimsical, but that seems to be exactly what they enjoy about it. There are enough recognizable images, such as sheep, tunnels, houses, and toothbrushes, that they spend time investigating each page. A fun and creative book."
5,A Perfect Bedtime Book for Train Lovers,"The Goodnight Train is a lovely bedtime story that takes the reader from bathtime to bedtime aboard the Goodnight Train. Its gentle rhyming text and train sounds make it a fun book to read: ""Wheels are turning. Smoke drifts high, painting clouds up in the sky. Huff-a-puff-a! Huff-a-puff-a Chooooo! Chooooo!"" The whimsical details in the illustrations also make this book engaging for preschoolers and kindergarteners.My four-year-old son, who loves trains, has decided that this is one of his favorite bedtime stories. And since I like it too, I don't mind reading it three or four times a night!-Sherry EllisAuthor ofThat Baby Woke Me Up, AGAIN"
5,Great bed time book!,Love reading this to my 15 month old son. He loves the noises and pictures. I love the easy read rhyming format and the pictures!
3,Kind of boring,"My toddler gets bored with this book easily even high he loves trains. The pictures don't seem to hold his interest and neither does the story. Too bad, I had high hopes for it."
5,Fun book for bedtime,This is my husband's favorite book to read to our daughter at bedtime. We had checked it out from the library and we all loved it so much that we purchased it from Amazon. The illustrations are really great and there is a lot to look at when our baby is old enough to be really interested in the pictures. The story is cute and it is a nice change from Goodnight Moon.
5,The MOST amazing book! Must Read!,"Bought this book for my 2 year old daughter through a childrens book club. After reading it every night she knows the story. We can sit down with the book and she will read it to me, know when to turn the pages. She loves the story and the little choo-choo sounds that are in each story line. She loves the story so much she has memorized it. A must read for youngsters and it will keep their attention."
5,Hit the track to Dreamland,"My son was almost two when we found this book. I was attracted to it for three reasons:1. TRAINS2. Goodnight story3. Captivating illustrationsWhat keeps us coming is all the above and the lovely rhyming text.My son loves finding all the hidden treasures in the illustrations. Toothbrush, football, cookie, shower, bathtub, all sorts of things that relate to bedtime and not! What a thrill when he noticed the mermaid putting on night lotion - he loved that since we always do lotion after the bath and realized that others do too."
5,TXMom,"This book is so fun to read. My son was 6 mo. old when we got it and he just loves it. The pictures are fantastic, the story rhymes and is very cleverly written. I would recommend this to anyone with a preschooler."
5,My grandsons' favorite book,"Both of my grandsons love this book. I bought it for them this summer, as they love Thomas the Train. I was hesitant, as it was $16.99 at the time. It is worth every penny! My daughter reads to them every night and this quickly became their favorite book. They request Good Night Train every night before bed. The words are soothing and rhthymic, and the pictures are beautifully illustrated. My one grandson loves to point out the ""baby tugboat"" in every picture... This book is sure to become a classic and helps little eyes close with sweet dreams of choo choos sure to follow. I would give this more than 5 stars if possible!"
1,Review Of Kindle Edition - Beware,"I've never written a review of anything on Amazon until now. If you are considering purchasing the Kindle Edition of this book, please do not. It is simply one of the worst Kindle conversions of a book I've ever seen. The illustrations are poorly scanned, they tried to squeeze 3 - 4 book pages onto 1 Kindle page, and the text on the pages does not match up with the illustrations shown. Overall, the book is basically unreadable. I am reading it on an iPad (Kindle App) so there should be plenty of screen resolution and space to see this book.I'm sure it is a wonderful story in book form but I would caution anyone considering the Kindle Edition to avoid it at all costs."
5,great illustrations,My son gets a kick out of looking for the little images on each page. Sweet bedtime book. We gave it to him with a set of trainsheets for a bed-timed themed birthday present.
3,Fun pictures,"This book is cute with very imaginative illustrations. However, I was disappointed with the story - it's pretty basic. just a line, sometimes two per page. I was hoping for something a little more in depth. My 2-year old son does like it, but it's only about a minute read. I wouldn't buy it again if I had it to do over again."
1,Good story bad layout,The story is cute but the words do not match up with the pictures and it makes it very difficult to read to my kids. Buy the hard copy instead.
5,Grandparent's Bookshelf Favorite.,This book was given to my son's in-laws for their grandparent bookshelf. The train theme had a special meaning and the book is delightful. Would buy it again!
3,JULIE ANDREWS IN TOP FORM,"""STAR!"" is the film-bio of tempermental, self-absorbed, incandescent Gertrude Lawrence. Lawrence may have been the subject but JULIE ANDREWS IS THE REAL STAR OF ""STAR!"" Some of the songs are clinkers, but Andrews gets to go all soft with ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" and ""My Ship"" and then belt out slightly risque and bawdy renditions of Cole Porter's ""The Physican"" and the Kurt Weill-Ira Gershwin classic ""Saga Of Jenny."" Andrews also does a fantastic version of Noel Coward's ""Parisian Perrot."" Julie Andrews would not have as varied a role as this until ""VICTOR/VICTORIA"" some 14 years later."
1,"SUE, MISS JULIE SUE!!!!!!","Now, HOW could they? Miss Julie's ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" CD is technically brilliant [1967 - this atrocity is circa 1968] - Thank you MCA for remastering 'Millie"", BUT this version of the much-maligned ""Star"" is a piece of c***! It IS just awful - an absolutely slap in the face.There's nothing redeeming here! Totally technically inferior!An absolute insult to Miss Andrews brilliance.{""It"" sounds like ancient 78 rpm recordings hap-hazardly slapped on plastic!}Quite, quite awful!"
5,Replica Jersey,"This jersey is has a lot going for it. The perfect team, the perfect number, and the perfect fit. Yes, I am a STEELER fan! I bought this for my son and it fits great, durable, and is machine washable."
5,Great Quality,This is a quality made product. I purchased it for my grandson as a gift and he is so proud to wear it. I bought it large so he could wear it for years. I think it will still look great even after he outgrows it.
3,Youth Steelers jersey,"The youth jersey was just okay...not great. The fabric felt a bit cheap and for the price, it was less than what I expected. I would have wished to know the quality of the fabric and craftsmanship before I purchased this product."
5,The Impending Hour II,This is the most informative book you will ever read next to the Bible itself. I recomend anyone who is not saved and have uncertianties about Christ's return to earth about the tribulation to read this. This is the best gift to give unsaved friends and family. It has a section for what to do it you miss the Rapture. It explains everything to come.
5,Tuna Christmas is 2 funny,"We watch this at least once a year and may have it on many more times just to keep it light around the holidays, I reccomend it to all native texans and even just those who are wondering about small town ""society"" in Texas"
5,Even better than the original,"I just finished performing this play and it's even better than the original. A fresh, funny and touching Christmas story, the laughs keep coming and never let up. Guaranteed to make you laugh and feel the holiday the spirit. A Must-see!"
4,"Tuna Christmas - if you know it, you love it","I bought this as a gift, and my friend liked it, but he liked the original better, since it wasn't as ""produced"" - you could tell it was only 2 guys....."
3,Interesting Life of a Fascinating Star,"The telling of the story itself is not as interesting as the man himself. It is told very objectively, and if you want a well-written biography of a dancer, I suggest Bernard Taper's ""Balanchine."" But Smakov's telling suffices to portray the life of Latvia-born Barshynikov, who defected from the Communist USSR to become one of the greatest dancers of all time, dancing for American Ballet Theater initially, then, yearning for a chance to work with George Balanchine, switching to New York City Ballet. The book itself is a bit dated, seeing as it has no account of Barshnikov's founding of the White Oak Dance Project, which thrives today as a monumental collaboration of the some of the best modern dancers around today."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,The songs selected for this album are really bad. There are only 2 that are any good (towards the end) so you have to Fast Forward through the repetative boring ones. It's a really bad CD and a total waste of money.
5,Nice Brass Button,"This was a replacement button for one that failed. It was easy to install. The button ""snaps"" into the brass plate, and the fit there could be a bit better as it is somewhat loose. But functionally it works fine and the appearance is great!"
4,Very good book!,"My 5 year old daughter has developed a great interest in Helen Keller, and we've collected several children's books about her. This book and one other are her two favorites, and they have been read many times. This book helped develop an interest in learning sign language for my daughter. I highly recommend it for a small child as an introduction to biographies."
1,Complete letdown,"This is one of the most disappointing books I've ever read; a cliched ""silence of the lambs"" knock-off where neither the criminal nor the motives are believable. The author creates numerous suspects, never fully developing any of them, and then out of thin air chooses one of them to be the villain. An attempt to make the main character interesting by giving her an unusual occupation and bringing her into a relationship falls short."
2,completely average,"I should have seen a red flag when I noticed that one of the positive reviews on the back of the book came from her very own husband!All-in-all, this book was completely average. There was nothing that stood out about it. The writing wasn't that exciting, and the author introduces so many characters that I had trouble keeping them all straight. I didn't feel any of them were developed well either.Bleh."
1,Never trust a husband...,"Body Parts is a crime itself. Describing gory scenes doesn't make up for lack of plot or credibility. To me, it was easy to guess the murderer, but harder to guess what the obsession with the main character was. She is unbeliveable. Supposedly smart, yet can't fix a light bulb with the danger around her? The references to the drums were ridiculous. Please... I should have been worried when her husband's review was used on the back cover."
4,A truly female detective,"This book was a thrilling ride the whole way. The title suggests gore, and that suggestion was amply fulfilled. The thrills and bumps in the ride kept me guessing. But what I really appreciated was the character of the female protagonist. Too often, the ""new"" female detective is a hard-boiled, isolated, standard male detective in a skirt. But this one has connections, relationships, and feelings that really suggest a woman. She doesn't really operate like a lone wolf, but someone who knows and cares about other people. This makes it a little harder to put her in the ""final jeopardy"" needed for the last chapter, but Stiefel pulled this off admirably. Quite a first effort."
5,E Best,"I have been using Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E body lotion for over 20 years and I wouldn't use anything else for a skin lotion or a healing agent for scratches, cuts, and blisters. Sore feet or blisters from walking? Wash the affected area, pop the blisters and slather on the lotion. Do it again before going to bed and the next morning the soreness and redness is gone. It is the best."
3,Colorful,"After hearing the lead single, ""Play My Funk"", it was hard to determine the direction in which the album would go. The closest that comes to Simple E's style may have been Left Eye. There's another surprise, she sings as well. The album is as colorful as the title, Colouz Uv Sound, but lacked with substance and the fact that she recycled her own lyrics to create hooks for other songs. For a debut this isn't a good sign. The creativity upheld as the album was falling due to lack of attention. Smoking is a must as the mood gives a more relaxing atmosphere on ""Kinke Reggae"". ""Realite"" or reality is captivating with its realism as it gives closure to this LP on a good note."
2,umm...,"I hate to give this 2 stars... but omg... This is not good I'm sorry. Production is sub-par. The songs are just not good... I don't even know really what to say. Listen, if you are buying this because you are hoping to hear more great songs like ""Play my Funk"", you WILL be disappointed. The only other good song was ""Neck Wreck"", and thats cause the beat is crazy. Whoever was managing Simple E, or behind her team should have payed more money for better production, also spent more time on the songs... I mean this album is just not good. She had maaaad potential though once you get used to her unique style."
5,for the Palm V series ONLY!?,"I love this leather case when I first time saw it! But my palm is the Palm IIIc... Please... [Dooney & Bourke Bayou], if someday you have design for the Palm IIIc, please let me know!"
5,A+,"Super quick shipping, very pleased, everything was in brand new condition. Already loved the series, I'm sure my sister will as well."
3,Don't forget the Tapes !!!,"This book is well laid out and easy to follow. However, I made a big mistake and ordered the version without the Audio Tapes. If you are beginning to learn Polish DONT FORGET THE TAPES!! Without the tapes, it's easy to become intimidated by the pronunciation, and then become disheartned, like I did..... :("
1,Horrible,"This book is probly the worst Polish book in existance. It includes very little grammer and has a very confusing format. It's simply bad, bad, bad, bad. Dont make the same mistake I did. DONT BUY THIS BOOK."
4,For our little baseball lover!,"Another winner from Ty-- such an adorable little bear and we hope itwill be a well-loved toy! Quality was perfect, as always"
5,great book,this is a great book. I would recommend it to anyone. If you are looking for a good read that is worth the small pricetag.. look no further
1,Terrible translation!,"The tranzlation forr this volume iz abzolutely horreble! I'm returning this book promptly. Full of typos, and mizzplaced and mismatched letters, it's nearly impossible to read. Avoid this garbage, and get a better translation than this schlocky work!I just cannot believe Amazon would sell this crap to anyone."
2,For lack of better words Hoakey,"I read this book and found it to be just that; hoakey. I have even attempted some of the spells in it and well; they in no way shape or form worked. I have worked with many forms of magic & well this is just not it. It is good for a few laughs through her stories. I do believe that this is a good book to read, but for performing magic that will truly work, this is not the book."
4,Very Nice,The style is beautiful and good quality. The only problem is that they need polished when washed in the dishwasher.
2,"Oh, please.......","These video's are rough. I am sorry but I bought this for my 2 year old and I am pretty sure she will not care to even watch them until she is like 8 or 9. They were put out in the late 70's and they do reflect it. I gave them 2 stars ONLY because they seem to stay close to the bible in content. But really dont even waste your 10 bucks. The animation and the dialogue are horribly stiff. There is nothing here to make a child interested in learning about the Bible, maybe one day when she already wants to learn about it but this video collection is certainly not going to instill any desire."
3,Rare sightings,"Fans of retro electronica-laced rock, especially with geeky, spacey overtones, will get a kick out of the Hungarian 80's sci-fi excursion thoroughly, the rest of us have to sift through some pretty dated formulations to mine some exciting material- which does in all fairness, reappear quite often and surprisingly amidst soppy transitioning."
1,I'd give it 0 if I could...,"I must say, I was willing to pay this amount because I thought I was getting a better quality item. After a only a few weeks, this bag caved in and my puppy would no longer go into it. I tried several times and ways to fix it, but it would not stay up.I contacted the company and they told me to ""stuff it with wet towels and spray it heavily with starch..."" are they kidding? Then I found a reference to this problem under their web site FAQ's. So, they are knowingly selling a defective item and expecting the customer to then fix it. They never responded to my second email... I could not return it because it had been used.This is a company that does NOT stand behind it's products. I found a much less expensive one at target, and it works much better!Do not waste the extra $ on this item."
5,Made a horrible experience more bearable,I had to fly my cat from Ohio to Boston and this carrier made it more bearable. She did make a small mess in the carrier because she does not travel well in cars but I was able to throw away the liner and clean up the carrier with the cat still in the carrier. It fit perfectly under the seat on the plane.
5,Light and well made,"I have a very small cat so can't speak for size overall but perfect for her. Although it has a perfectly good floor padding, I added one of those fleece beds you can buy for $8 at Petco and she feels comfortable and secure. I only use it to and from the vet but it is her safe haven. It also has convenient straps to thread the car safety belts through. Excellent product."
2,too small,i returned it brcause it was way too small for my cat. I could barely zip it up and I had too squeeze her in
1,Don't use the zippers!!!!!!!!,"Purchased the medium ""Original Sherpa Delux"" with high hopes for flying with our 10 month old, 9 lb dog. On my second training run in the car I left the top flap open and my dog bit the open zipper track - which made the zipper inoperable. I shipped the carrier to Sherpa, figuring they would cut me some slack given the item was brand new and I was using it in good faith with a toy dog. I offered to upgrade to a better zipper, if available. Guess what? Not only did they not help me, they emailed me back requesting a Visa card # so they could charge me to ship the damaged item back. ""Satisfaction guaranteed"" is not part of their warranty. As an aside, there is no better zipper available from Sherpa...per the warranty customer representative I spoke with."
2,Bottom moves ourpt from under pet,I do like this carrier for the most part but when our cat was hit by a car we put him in the carrier to keep him as still as possible. He actually rolled it once and the lining came out from under him. There is no solid base under the lining pad so it was very difficult to keep the pad under him in his agitated state. I was never a fan of hard carriers before but a firmer base would have spared him some pain in this situation.
4,An excellent omnibus edition of some of Clarke's best work.,"Arthur C. Clarke wrote prolifically in the 1950's, touching many subjects. Through his short stories, he exposed audiences to many new concepts. This compilation includes ""The Sentinel"", which was used in the tremendous work ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", as well as several other short stories. Clarke's monumental novel ""Childhood's End"" received many positive reviews, and still stands as one of the most innovative of all science fiction works. One of the best depictions of life on the Moon someday in the future is ""Earthlight"", another of Clarke's novels included in this edition."
4,"Overall, a great read","Overall I liked this book very much. Lush, breath-taking descriptions of the Sand Lizard people and their world, and its contrast to the greed of the white world. I found the characters engaging, and reading this book made me feel a deep sense of loss---the world has lost the wisdom and tradition of Native people. The greedy and destructive ways of one culture have won out and all of humanity is worse off for it.In terms of criticism of the book, I thought it needed a better editor. Silko has a talent for writing descriptions, but at times the descriptions went on and on for pages. It boggs down the storyline several times. Still, this flaw does not detract from an enjoyable read."
2,On and On...where's the editor when you need one,"First, I'm a fan of LMS. That's why I'm critical of this work. It read like it was often restarted with only little effort to avoid repeating itself, then put away,and so on and so on. And then come the last few pages, reflecting a style that wants to wrap this baby up. Its a story about people I genuinely cared about; but told in a style that seems to regularly turn into a trance inducing chant, often robbing the story of its power.But then again, maybe that was the other story being told."
4,Old-fashioned read with contemporary overtones,"I just finished this book in a marathon reading stint yesterday and found it a delightful read. Taking place around the turn of the century and interweaving the lives and stories of Native Americans in the West with a couple of east coast high society transplants, Silko creates a novel that has an old-fashioned appeal and pacing. The story unravels slowly and methodically, with nothing rushed, and much of the moments guessed before they occur, but in a way that is satisfying. Beyond this, she inflicts some contemporary issues and concerns onto this time period--feminism, cultural dissolution, land use-- that are obviously projected but powerful for the modern reader. My one criticism is that I did feel the novel drag a bit in the last third or so, but it kept me enchanted none-the-less. Overall I would highly recommend this novel."
3,Gardens in the Dunes,"It just wasn't my type of book - I ordered it because one of my grandsons recommended it. He is in to organic gardening and natural farming, and I was curious to see what he liked about it. It was well written, but just not my cup of tea."
4,gardens in the dunes: sensitive and spriritual read,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and loved Indigo's deeply spiritual relationship and respect for all living things - especially her ability to relate to others raised in different cultures yet shared the same respect and understanding of life. I look forward to reading other works of Silko!
3,Uneven Reading,"Op 49 sonatas sparkle but Pastoral and Waldstein seem lifeless. Circle back after spending time with one of the more famous interpretations (Arrau, Barenboim, Brendel, Frank, Gilels, Goode, Kempff, O'Conor et al)."
2,ALTERNATE TAKE ?,THIS CD WOULD HAVE SERVED MINGUS'S IMAGE AS A GREAT BASS PLAYER IF IT HAD REMAINED IN A VAULT.
3,Not A Keeper,"Definitely high on the wow factor scale. But after that wears off you realize that you have a very poor quality digital camera. The most critical failing is that the pictures are out of focus much beyond 20 feet or so (i.e., can't focus at infinity). The muddy colors don't help either. Though perhaps tolerable to some on the limited Casio display, when tranferred to the PC the picture quality is intolerable. Even the poorest quality 640 x 480 digital camera shines by comparison. I give it three stars only because it does integrate well with the Cassiopeia and I think the fact it can make mini movies is pretty slick. Nevertheless I returned mine to Casio."
3,Nifty but poor picture quality,Very cool gadget for the Cassiopeia but the picture is indeed rough especially when blown up on a PC. Photo quality is also dim without sunlight. Definitely not for pro or serious photo shoots. Okay for casual image capture. You may have to wait until they come up with higher pixels. ...
2,Welles considers this book his definitive biograpy.,"We are told on the back cover that Welles considers this his difintive biography and the way in which he would want to be remembered. This is a sad statement, when you consider that there is no mention by Welles of either of his daughters, Christopher and Rebecca. One has to refer to the chronology at the back of the book to find that these people actually existed. It seems that Welles treated them in the same way as everything he cared about, he left. Admiration for Hitchcock, he finished his films."
1,Garage Sale,"I did a little research on the different electric coolers that are on the market. Koolatron seemed to get decent reviews, but not great. I had a Coleman before that lasted about 2 years with occasional use and it did a good job to keep our food cold over a 48 hour period. The cooler arrived in a cardboard box, no packaging to protect it and without any bill of sale. The condition was something that you might expect from a garage sale. The latch was broken and did not close and the sticker was peeling off. Luckily I was able to return it and order the same Coleman that I had before. However, I did so through Walmart.com for two reasons, better price and quicker delivery. As a rule, I try to avoid Walmart when possible, but due to inferior product from Amazon, I was left with no choice."
1,Koolatron fails to deliver.,"After reading through all the shinning reviews of this product I had thought that it would have been well worth the trouble. However, that was not the case. When it arrive it was in it's original shelf box with no packing material at all. The quality of craftmanship was horrible. When opening the lid to examine the interior the seams that were held in by tiny screws began to seperate... I had the unit on for several hours hooked to a 12 volt system to get cold. Once again I was disappointed at the results. After several hours it was only mildly cold. The outside air temperature was in the 60's. I filled the unit up with items from my regrigator anyways to test it out. Along the way on my trip with the unit plugged in, the unit failed yet again. The dairy products were warm and everything else was as well even with being plugged into the colling side. I would not recommend this product at all to anyone."
1,Not good,"I bought this for our boat. First it blew a fuse. I could not find any where what size fuse to to put in it. Called their support line and got the answer. Then the plug keeps coming out of the adapter. Bought a different plug and wired it up, worked for a few days and now it does not cool or heat? It did at first with the new plug. I would not buy this unit ever again."
1,poorly made,"Koolatron stopped cooling after 5 uses. Of course, it is not under warranty any longer.Weak fan and poor cooling. Cheap electronics. Overall, just a pooly made cooler.Koolatron told me it was probably the ""chip"". I asked them to send a ""chip"" to me and I would repair it but ehy said, ""no, we don't allow that. Even the authorized repair people instal then incorrectly"".Not worth the cost to ship to a repair facility, have them repair the unit, then ship back.Don't waste yout money on Koolatron."
4,Works great,This cooler keeps things 30 degrees cooler than the outside temperature which at 80 degrees is 50 degrees not bad for a 12 volt cooler. I got the AC adapter and use it at home as well. Save a lot of money on the road by passing up the fastfood places and pulling an ice cold soda out of my cooler to have with a nice homemade sandwich and potato salad. Keeps the kids happy longer too.
4,Great cooler with great space,"We have had a Coleman cooler in the past and I am much happier with this unit. Love the doomed lid on this cooler, it adds a lot more space. Cools well and runs quietly. Have not tried it on the heat setting yet so am not sure how well that works. Am able to keep items from the grocery store cool even on hot days with multiple stops and we live 45 minutes from where we grocery shop. One suggestion is to make sure you plug it in and let it cool before you put items in it - it seems to work more effectively that way."
2,Not so good cooler,"I'm a truck driver and have used the coleman and igloo electric coolers, and recently purchase a koolatron. The cooler freezes up, the motor spins both fans and is too weak to turn fans as fast as they need to go. Within 3 weeks the latch broke. It is cheaply made; will not but another. I'll go back to Coleman and keep some money in my pocket; it was the better value for my money. Customer service was great on sending replacement for latch."
2,12VDC plug stinks,It works when you can get the 12VDC plug fully seated in the recepticle. One of the four receptlcles I own will run the cooler. The cooler plug has a larger diameter area that keeps the plug from fully engaging in standard 12VDC recepticles. I'll probably have to buy a replacement plug and wire it in so that it will work on my boat.
1,Major disappointment,"After reading the reviews, I bought one of these. I am an over-the-road trucker and was tired of buying a new Coleman every 6 months. I thought I would give this one a try. After about 3 months of use, I would rate this a DO NOT BUY. It will not keep frozen water bottles frozen more than 1 to 2 days in my cab. It does keep things cool, just not cold."
3,Travel cooler,"This is a good cooler if you need a LARGE battery operated cooler. This unit was actually larger than what we needed.... but we decided to keep it anyway and buy a smaller unit. We probably won't use this one very often.... but it's handy to have around ""just in case""."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered this item the end of May 2010. We used it once to go on a day trip and put it back away. We pulled it out of the box in July and took it on a family vacation. On our way back home, the unit stopped working. Of course this was after the warranty expired. I contacted Koolatron about the issue to see what they recommended. They told me to check a fuse in the cord that runs to the outlet, which was not the problem. I contacted them again to ask what else I could do and they have never contacted me back. I would think this unit, for the price paid, should be more durable than to go out after one week of usage."
5,Koolatron P-95,"What a great cooler! Traveling interstate with perishables in it for 6 hours, and nice and COLD! Very quiet running unit, spacious too!!! I would DEFINITELY BUY another one if I need to!!"
5,GREAT COOLER,"I ordered this unit from Koolatron, via Amazon....it is a factory re-conditioned unit, and appeared flawless coming out of the box.I SPECIFICALLY ordered this for my mother, who lives in an assisted-living apt. that has a TINY 'fridge in Kitchenette. SO, Koolatron to the rescue! She has this set-up in another room, so her kitchenette isn't crowded, and it provides her w/ much needed extra 'fridge capacity. SO FAR, it's been a month and NO PROBLEMS w/ unit....obviously, it's hooked-up to AC converter/adaptor, 24/7.My mother couldn't be more pleased with this addition to her apartment!!Thanks to Koolatron!"
4,Really does the job,"I used this unit from Indianapolis to New Hampshire and back and then from Indy to Houston and back. It kept things nicely chilled during the very hot summer and I just took it inside most nights and, with the adapter (sold separately) plugged it into the AC.My only displeasure and surprise is that there is no kind of latch or lock on the lid/door, so I felt it necessary to strap it shut. This was highly inconvenient."
2,Marginal,"If you place warm items in here, it takes forever to cool them down, and then only keeps them cool not cold."
1,Crappy Kooler,"The Koolatron cooler was broken when I opened the box. The cheap, plastic lid latch was in pieces. So I returned the product for another one, not a problem. Except it was a problem, as the second time I opened the box, I found that this cooler was also broken. The cheap plastic of the lid latch was broken once again. So the cooler goes back and I'm not getting another one. I never even got to try the actual cooling/heating action of the cooler itself because of the stupid, cheap, crappy lid latch. Just looking for a quality product and this my friends is far from it."
2,Door latch broken,"We researched electric travel coolers and decided Koolatron was the best and ordered one. When it arrived I noticed the plastic latch for the door was broken off. Not a problem if you are using it as a chest cooler, but if you are using it upright this would be a problem. Ordered a replacement and it arrived in the same condition. So I went to a local store and bought the Coleman version, for less money, and it has been working great. The Coleman version has the same plastic latch as the Koolatron but the door on the Coleman is designed better so that it can not shift as much. I believe the shifting of the door during shipment and handling caused the plastic latch to break. This is probably a good product if you don't have it shipped and just buy it in a store. But I am happy with the Coleman version. It cost less, works good and looks better."
4,Koolatron P95 cooler,"This is a great cooler except 1. it drained our car battery to zero when we didn't unplug it overnight, 2. we had ice crystals on our sliced ham travelling in cooler temps, no controls for temp. Be sure to buy the conversion plug so you can plug it into the wall in your hotel or whatever, got one at Walmart for $23."
1,2 strikes,"I have bought two of these P95 coolers in the last year, thinking I just had the misfortune of a getting a lemon the first time. Both had to be returned.The second time, the unit had so little cooling capacity that I had to throw away hundreds of dollars of food and medications because the temp inside was no different than the ambient room temp, although the motor was definitely running (and seemed cool when I put the items in). Is it possible that the motor burned out with a single use?Amazon was good enough to refund me each time, but I can't help wondering if the units were packed appropriately -- rather than being shipped in only the descriptive cardboard -- would they arrive in better working condition?I have purchased other Koolatron products in the past and have been somewhat satisfied, but I'm thinking these things are just generally poorly manufactured."
5,There's No Better Sci Fi Score!,"Part of the appeal that this film enjoys is it's one of a kind music score by the master, Bernard Herrmann. Though made in 1951, The Day the Earth Stood Still easily stands the test of time and so does the accompanying score which accentuates each scene that it accompanies. Of all the fine Herrmann scores, this must be near the top. The remake of this movie is out tomorrow and though it may be enjoyable, I doubt it will compare with its predecessor and the same goes for the soundtrack. This is truly one of a kind. Don't let it get away."
4,Using Pretec 56K with Ipaq 3650 Pocket PC,"After upgrading the OS of the IPAQ to ver. 1.69 all CF modems would not operate. COMPAQ tech support recommended the PERTEC or thier COMPAQ CF modem. They said PERTEC made it for them. It installed without a hitch and seems quite fast. I have yet to figure out how to ""FAX"" with it or active the ""dialing tones"". I'm quite satisfied"
1,Works Intermittently & Poor Technical Support,I purchased the Pretec Modem for a Cassiopeia E-115. The Modem usually will not Dial Out and Hangs at the Port Open & has to be reset. It sometimes indicates that an IR Send or Receive is in use indicating that there is a conflict.Sometimes reinstalling the ISP information will get the modem to function properly for a while. Most of the time the Modem will not Dial.Technical support was NOT helpful & they kept referring me to a website that did not offer any insight into this particular problem.If you purchase this product for a Cassiopeia E-115 I hope your experience is more pleasant.
4,looking for 56 K modem for my cassiopeia E125.,Doesn't have to be new. But a good price.My email is oceans@world-net.co.nz.Will need to be shipped to NewZealandThanks Graeme
1,Trouble connecting,"This is my second Pretec modem and my second Pocket PC. I could not get the connection to work with the HP545 or the Casio E-115. Each time the connection goes through, it immediately disconnects. I'm proud someone posted the tech support number online. I'll try that tommorrow."
5,Pretec Modem Is Easy!,"I purchased the Pretec modem for my HP Jornada 545 and was amazed at how simple it is to use. By simply popping it in the unit, Windows automatically recognized it and no drivers were required. I did have a configuration problem and Pretec support had me the answers I needed in under a minute! I recommend this product for anyone looking to take full advantage of their Pocket PC. It's a must."
1,Beware Cassiopeia E-125 Owners!,"I bought the Pretec 56K CompactFlash Modem for my Cassiopeia E-125, only to learn (from technicians at Pretec) that the E-125 is a battery hog, as is the Pretec modem. In other words, although this modem works fine with other Casio units, it requires you to use the AC adapter to make it work. At least that's what the tech guy told me. He even recommended buying a different brand for the E-125.And even plugged in, I haven't gotten the thing to work yet."
5,It works well. What a great product!,"It's truely an amazing product. I like the integrated dongle part. The modem card comes with a built-in phone jack. I don't need to worry about lossing the cable, or the dongle. I definitely recommend it to my friends."
4,Works very well but do youreally need it?,"I bought this fine product right after I bought my Pocket PC. It plugged right in and i dialed up my earthlink account with no problem. I dont think it could have been easier. The only thing is, i have only used it 3 or 4 times. Whats the point? Pocket IE works well but the view is way to small. Its cool to be able to pull up web pages on your Pocket PC but it looses its coolness pretty quick. Now a wireless modem would be useful but they are a lot more expensive and have additional monthly fees."

3,Mediocre for the genre,"Russian chant is so popular due to the richness of sound (supplied largely in part by the cavernous depth of the Russian bass voice). This album is lacking in such rich performances. One piece flows into the next (not literally) and one finds themselves easily distracted and looking for something more interesting to occupy their minds. The mystery of sound, which so many people find soothing and meditative, is also lacking on this album. There are much better buys in this genre."
3,It's OK but it's not a good reference book,I'm a programmer and I had do some VBA programming in Access so I thought that I'd buy a book to learn what the difference between VB and VBA is... This book didn't help. But I suppose it would be good for somebody that knows Access but doesn't know how to program.
4,"Good book, that I didn't fully agree with","At least this book mentions that osteoarthritis is highly correlated with body weight: the heavier you are, the more chance that your knees or hips will give out, especially if you are a woman (sorry, but it is true). I think that the author is right that to some extent, science has been manipulated by the diet industry and by scare tactics (let's face it, groups get heard by trying to scare us). I would not want to read this and then give myself the ""all clear"" as an overweight person, because I know about the impact (literally) of even 10 pounds of extra weight on the knees and hips. But this book is a good addition to the overall literature on dieting and weight."
4,Well-researched,"As someone who does a lot of reading on this topic, I don't agree with everything in this book. However, I appreciate the amount of research the author did before writing it. The book is informative- just don't let it be your only source of information on obesity as it is definitely biased."
2,read the table of contents before buying,"I was not impressed with the theory presented here. Disagreed with most of it. Oxford published, so must have some validity, but I did not buy his argument."
3,Moldy cow poop?,"Musically this outfit is really quite exceptional. These obviously classically trained musicians are uniquely creative and clever. There are times that the compositions sound like a marriage of Aaron Copeland and Frank Zappa. Unfortunately, the vocals are a bit difficult to take. Hungarian is a rather harsh language. If one doesn't understand Hungarian, listening to the vocalist offers little pleasure. As I sat listening to it my eight year old son said, ""Dad, these guys are good when they just play their instruments but the singer sounds like moldy cow poop."" There you have it. For foreign language avant garde or progressive music stick with the Italian's (Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso, PFM, Le Orme, Museo Rosenbach, Locande Delle Fate, etc.) It's a shame, as After Crying are really quite brilliant otherwise...Simon"
4,instep stroller,this stroller is wonderful! my husband doesnt complain about kicking the back and its large wheels dont get stuck or slow you down. it folds up easily too. the only problem i see it that the sunshade doesnt really cover the baby all that well... our solution was to lay a baby blanket over the top and that works just fine.
4,great little stroller,"Can't beat this one for the price! The front swivel wheel makes this one of the most maneuverable strollers I have used, it is light, easy to collapse, and great on almost any terrain. I only have 2 very small issues, one is that the seat does not sit all the way up (close to a 90 degree angle, so baby is always reclined, which seems to annoy my 8 month old...) Also the canopy does not provide much sun protection, but like I said, well worth the $$$, great little stroller."
2,Swivel wheel did not work!,I had the double of this same jogger and loves it. Thats why when I needed a single I bought the same model. The swivel wheel does not work. I have tried a couple times and it wont turn while jogging. I am looking to return. Otherwise it is a great item. However that was my number one need in a jogger.
3,it works,well i haven't ran with it yet so i cant say anything about that. but what i can tell you is it works i did a little jogging with it here and my daughter doesnt seem to get bounced around. i like that the snack tray comes off. the wheels i am not sure about yet. i hate the front wheel for sure i can't move it well all the time and when its locked even harder to move around stores and such. it is bulky but useable it fits in my trunk with ease and i have a grand prix. i might suggest it to friends depending on what they are looking for. i will update more as i use it a little more.
4,InStep Suburban Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller,"Lightweight, easy to handle/assemble. My 19 month old loves it. He usually falls asleep when we go for long walks. The only thing is I wished the harnest straps were longer."
5,"Great product, great price","I bought this stroller at half the original price, It needed to be assembled but came with all the necessary tools to put it together. It didn't take long to assemble. It's easy to fold up and the back wheels come off to fit it in smaller trunks like mine. My 2 year old and I love it!"
2,does not work right,"the product does not turn right for a jogging stroller. very disappointed in the way it handles. It is very sturdy, but would not recommened it for jogging"
4,Great stroller but does not have all the features listed,"I have just started jogging and I needed a stroller to do this with and I found this one.This stroller is great! Very easy to put together (I did it)! It is very smoothe. However it does not come with a Hand brake or tether. It does not have a parent view window. Lastly,there is no way to tether an infant seat to it. Good thing for me I don't need those features. Other than that its is a great stroller. I'm very pleased. Shipping was flash fast. Thank you Amazon. I will be shopping here again."
4,Bang for the Buck,"I would rate this stroller very high on the bang for the buck scale. It is pretty sturdy and you can lock the wheel or let it swivel. My husband likes the wheel locked because the ride is much more steady and smooth, but I like the swivel, it really helps with the 360 degree turns(shopping is a breeze.) We also noticed the wheelbase is a bit narrower than the Safari stroller at the store...also better for shopping isles and between cars in the parking lot. It is really easy to fold and fits in our Honda Accord trunk. For the money this stroller is awesome. for all you serious runners....my husband is a runner and says he probably would not go on a fast run with this, but jogging would be ok."
1,Disappointed,"I am totally disappointed in this stroller. This is the third jogger I have owned and by the far the worst. I bought it because it was a nice compact size and I could use it for everything. It folds up to a nice small size. However, after a week of using it, the wheels wobble so hard when I am just at a slow walk. I have to stop and let my poor child rest from being shaken so hard. Its like all three wheels are trying to their separate ways. I took the wheels off and checked to make sure it wasnt put together wrong, but still no luck. Even if front wheel is locked in place it wobbles. Small visor, so I had to buy an extension. Seat does not reclince all the way, so no napping in it while we are on the go. Fabric on seat is already tearing aways from the seams. Wheels have a terrible squeek too. I can live with all the problems except the wobbling is unbearable for my poor baby!"
1,Piece of Junk!,"I don't normally do reviews, but I felt that I had to on this one. This stroller is very poorly constructed. I have had it for two days now and already the fabric on the seat is torn in two places and the seat is broken. There are two little latches on the seat, and one of them broke off, so now the seat is crooked. I was not rough on the stroller at all. The fabric gets caught very easily on the frame when you fold it up and unfold it. That's how it got ripped. As far as the seat, I didn't notice it until I took my son to the zoo for the day, and tried to figure out why he was sitting so crookedly. Also, the wheels squeak horribly. I was totally embarrassed driving the thing around. The positives are that it does look nice, it rides pretty smooth, and the wheels come off easily so that it fits in car trunks without a problem. Still, the poor quality outweighs the pros, so I will be returning it. I would not recommend it."
3,Watch your fingers - InStep Jogging Stroller,"I was excited about the price and the free shipping, so I purchased the InStep Suburban Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller. I did not use it for jogging, but walking my newborn. It held her tight and upright, the way she likes to sit at three months. About the fourth time I used the stroller my finger was crushed in the side of the stroller. My middle finger was pinned and locked between the two bars that come together when the stroller is set-up from the folded position. After a trip to the ER my finger nail has fallen off, but the whole experience was quit painful. If you decide to purchase this item be careful where your other hand is placed when releasing the stroller from the folded position."
4,Good stroller for the price,"I got this stroller for mother's day and could not be happier with it. My husband said putting it together was a snap. The only problem we have had with it is that the front wheel can be wobbly at times, so you have to tighten the bolt or lock the wheel entirely. Would definitley reccomend it-"
4,Second Solo Effort.,"I remember seeing the video for ""Crown Of Madness"" in 1991 and anticipating Dave Stewart's new release, but it never came. The truth was that ""Honest"" was never released in America. Thanks to Amazon for carrying imports. I just bought this cd and must say that it is good, but probably not as good as the previous, 1990 release, ""Dave Stewart And The Spiritual Cowboys"". ""Honest"" follows the same musical vein as the former release but to lesser effect. There are still some great songs on ""Honest"", but I can see why Dave broke up the Spiritual Cowboys after this release and why the record company may have passed on releasing it in America. Dave Stewart doesn't make bad music and ""Honest"" can attest to this with songs like ""Honest"", ""Whole Wide World"", ""Crown Of Madness"" and ""Fool's Paradise"". If you are a fan of Dave or Eurythmics you can't miss with this second solo release. This cd was followed by 1994's ""Greeting From The Gutter"" and 1998's ""Slyfi""."
3,An okay CD,"I got this CD because I loved Robert Rodriguez's soundtrack for 'Desperado'. I like just about every song on that CD. I got this one because I like the opening title song and the barroom songs. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by the rest of the songs, but unfortunately I wasn't. The rest of the songs aren't bad, but they don't knock my socks off either. You also get Chet's speech, which is hilarious. The hidden track is the second part of his speech and should have been tagged on to the first part, which I find a bit annoying. Also, the barroom songs didn't seem as bright or peppy as they did in the DVD when I first heard them. This was disappointing. They sounded more studio produced then live. None-the-less, if you really liked certain songs from the movie and have to have them, I'd get this CD otherwise I might skip it."
4,Tito and Tarantula,I got this mainly for Tito and Tarantula's two songs that I love. There was some other good stuff on here like Stevie Ray Vaughn but I would recommend you buying all of Stevie's work! Same goes for ZZ Top. Nice compilation!
4,X Rated,"Some great licks and some fine artists, but some of it (like the movie) is not for tender ears (or eyes). Well worth the purchase for the music is terrific."
5,What more to say?,"I bought this because I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack to the movie. I particularly like the Mexican influence, and it makes it a particularly fun summertime soundtrack."
4,"Amazing, A Must Buy One!","""From Dusk Till Dawn - The Soundtrack"" is amazing. It has the fundamental rule: songs deeply related to the movie. You know that because when you are listening the CD, you feel the spirit of the movie. The songs ""Dark Night"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" and ""After Dark"" simply prove it. This CD are in the same level of ""Pulp Fiction - The Soundtrack"" and ""The Tarantino Connection"". If you like Tarantino movies and good music, buy this CD.RGheno"
5,Great Album,A really great combination of songs and sound clips from the film. My favorite tracks are:The Blasters - Dark NightJimmie Vaughan - Dengue Woman BluesZZ Top - She's Just Killing MeTito & Tarantula - Angry CockroachesStevie Ray Vaughan - Mary Had A Little LambTito & Tarantula - After DarkHighly recommended if you like the film.
5,excellent album,I purchased this compilation for a friend. He was ecstatic. The music on this movie album is very good. He really enjoyed it.
5,Biting,"I love everything on this soundtrack ""Dusk till Dawn"" where you will find some tremendous mood type Blues music. Also the monologues are entertaining.While watching the movie, I really felt like the songs added to the atmosphere of the film. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. There are a couple of country tunes too and they are not bad. A biting soundtrack... one of the best."
3,disappointed,I was disappointed when I listened to this soundtrack. I loved the music in the movie but not the entire track.
4,Falls only slightly short of awesome,"My only two gripes about this soundtrack are that there is not enough music on it, and some of it can cross the line to annoying at times - the ZZ Top tune, for instance. Otherwise, I would highly recommend it for the T&T songs alone."
5,I really did laugh out loud - a lot!,"I found this book on one of the AMAZON romance editors recommended lists and it truly was a laugh out loud book. (Pretty much everything I found on that list was good.) If you can start to wrap your mind around the idea of a modern woman psychologist telling a 1870's Southern male 'dumb men' jokes to relieve tension, you can start to get the feel of this writer's humor. Lots of reviews, especially by the publishers, say a book is funny, but mildly amusing is more like it. However, this book is a hoot. Read it. And have fun."
1,Is everyone crazy?,"I read a lot of romance, and usually agree with the ratings posted for books, but this author is way overrated. Her books read like a Three Stooges skit, disjointed dialogue, stupid plots, and even worse ""snappy reparte"". While her heros are generally well written, the heroines are pushy, crude and have an endless supply of stupid men/lawyer/etc jokes. Yuck. I would have had more fun throwing my money out a car window."
1,Just Plain Ludicrous,"Ridiculous and just plain ludicrous to ""rewrite"" a wonderful story and change it into some pathetic modern nightmare! Maybe the writer did not admire the original ""Sweet Savage Love"" but why not use her imagination and story telling skills (if any) to create something original????"
1,Sweeter savage horrible!!!,"This book was a waste. I downloaded it to my kindle. What a horrible mistake. I want my money back! How did this book receive 4 stars. Harriett needs to wake from that stupid dream and get to the point. I'm disgusted! There's no substance to this book. She braggs ""She was on Oprah."" I guess that's supposed to get people to read this garbage.Sweeter Savage Love"
5,Red hot and very funny,"I have never laughed as much as I have reading one of Sandra Hill's books, they are so unbelievably funny. My husband thought I was mad because I would be sitting there reading and in the next second I would be bursting out laughing. The scene on the train where Etienne and Harriet are making love in a cofin is one of the most memorable parts of the book. There are many such instances similar to this one.Apart from being another funny story, it is an intensly passionate story I have ever read. The sex is red hot. Trying out those female fantasies Harriet wrote about were explosive. The pages just sizzled.I was so glad the characters from FRANKLY, MY DEAR were bought back. It was great to see how those children had grown up, especially Cain and Abel. I hope this is not the end of the Baptiste family, please write some more books Sandra. You have plenty of scope with Etienne's brothers and sisters. Thanks you for a great story."
2,Lacking sweeter detail,"ok, I am not going to go into detail about this book, this has already been done. I thought this was a good story with an ok plot, that is why I gave it 2 stars. However, I thought this book lacked detail where it really mattered. An example of this lack of detail would be during several intimate encounters between the 2 main characters. Often times they would be in a provacative situation, and then the next sentence they are waking up the next morning seperately...come on! I wanted to know how they went their seperate ways. I thought the author went to too much trouble trying to write humor into the story and left out the most important details. This book is worth the read, if you can buy it very cheap. This is not a keeper."
2,The first time I have been disappointed!!!,"I have used Jensen for many purchases. In the past, when they showed a book as ""Good"", it was way better than that. This time was a different story. This book should have rated an ""Acceptable"", if that. The book practically fell apart in my hands."
1,Disappointing and overpriced,"This book was a real disappointment. It introduces a number of potentially great characters and then doesn't develop them. It has a great ""spy game"" backdrop, but all major plot points are explained in one or two line retrospective summaries. Many plot points are simply left hanging, unresolved... and had huge holes in logic to begin with.I'd forgive a weak plot in a great romance, but that's also lacking. The heroine is a pompous, overly-aggressive ultra-feminist. It's hard to understand how any man could love her. There are no sweet nothings and no romance here, just some one-night stands, vulgar banter and an inane string of man-hating wisecracks with all the subtlety of a knock knock jokes. This could have been a great book, but it isn't. Try Sandy Blair's book, AMan in a Kilt, for a much better example of time-travelling historical romance with enough plot, passion, and real humour to keep it interesting."
2,"Don't waste your time, this book is not very good","I was totally disappointed in this book. It took Harriet like 100 pages to figure out that it wasn't the present and that she was in the past. I couldn't believe that a woman who is supposed to be modern could actually believe that she was having a dream for more than 24 hours. It was a struggle to finish this book. Take my recommendation, don't waste your time."
2,This book's about 101 years out of date,"The one I bought anyway. And if you've written a book using Microsoft Word 2007+, you can export to a PDF document anyway, that can be sent to a self publishing company or a printer. No point in using this stuff anymore."
3,Phillips gone bad,It's a great screw driver set. But unfortunately the phillips screwdriver did not last. Total life of phillips screwdriver was approx 3 hours.Now I have to purchase another screwdriver. I'll make sure to buy a different brand. Going with snap-on this time.
2,Long Delay,I would not know how to describe this item. I orderedit Aug 23 and it is now Oct 1st and it is not anywhereto be seen.
3,Food Of The Gods Part II. Review,"If you love those good old-fashioned Saturday monster movies then you may want to take a look at this great straight-to-cable sequel about giant mutated rats that run amok at a college campus.Of course, as is always the case, the authorities don't believe anyone and the Dean is too concerned with promoting a fundraiser for the new pool on campus so the rats keep on eating the co-eds with only one concerned Professor trying to stop them.The film's conclusion involving giant rats showing up at the pool and eating everyone in sight is a real treat for gore fans. Of course, the dimwitted cops end up killing more people than the rats when their cross-fires end up in the crowd. These people have to be some of the dumbest victims in monster movie history.If you can find this one, you should pick it up, if you're a fan of great old school cult horror flicks. If not, you might still get a few laughs."
1,bad acting,the story line was bad. Acting bad. Not realistic at all. If you like scary movies don't wast your time
5,Great Movie!,"I bought this for a friend of mine, and after it arrived he got me to sit down and watch it with him. I have to say it's a really good movie and I enjoyed it alot. Even more than the first one I have to admit."
3,Way too short for the price!!!,This video contained one episode of mr. Rogers. I think they could have combined a few others on there to make it worth spending so much money on! The show is great though.
3,Anger management,"This is a good DVD and I think it was of help to my grandson, but I do think it's abit outdated.I love Mr. Roger's, but think the same message could be updated into a format that young childrenwould better appreciate and be better at getting their attention. My husband found it boring...It's purpose is to help a child deal with anger and if they are bored, it won't work. That said,I used one of the techniques from the DVD and encouraged my grandson to take a deep breath when hewas upset, and when he did that, he had a big smile on his face....and the dark cloud disappeared.So, this DVD is helpful."
1,"This ""Sing Along"" DVD does not show lyrics","There is no ""karaoke-style"" line at the bottom of the video songs to help viewers to sing along. The music is ok and the graphics are great but as a ""sing along"" video, it fails miserably."
4,Very enjoyable,"This was a very good film.It's a case study in greed, guilt,exploitation, redemption, and self-preservation. Honestly, it took mea while to fully catch on toMr. Ashbury's scheme because we geta lot of insinuation, but not muchdialogue about what's going on. Finally,in maybe the last ten minutes or soof the film, everything is unleashedat once and you're left to process allthe information that would have beencommon knowledge in a real life situation.The plot is mildy far fetched and once all thedots were connected, I was still left thinking,""Um, what the hell....?""Anyway, I like and recommend the movie, mostly because of Mr.Ashbury's smooth, cold demeanor. Did anyoneelse think that Matt Davis came across as acrybaby in this film?"
3,You can watch this more than once.,"Ok, James Spader has another role as a dirtbag - but let's be honest, he is good at being a dirtbag.I liked the idea of ""collecting"" criminals and punishing them through each other - lots of interesting material in this movie for law and security professionals."
4,"Great book, Hate the way it was written.",Its is a great read but i cant get over how it was written. Come on i read some books that have a better way of writeing then this one
4,Captain Blood,"Interesting take on a ""good"" pirate. Classically written and a pleasant departure from modern writing. The main character is like a pirate super hero."
5,James Edinger: Watching For The Wind,This is an excellent little book recommended by my soaring instructor. It provides a useful explanation of meteorological concepts. He provides illustrations from common local conditions in southern California in very readable terms. I recommend this book for anyone interested in a non-technical understanding of whether phenomena.
3,The Way to Shambhala,I loved the first 100 pages of this reading. It dealt mostly with the geography and mystical aspects of the region. After that it became a repetitive series of pages involving a look at the superstition of the mythical kingdom. I would only suggest this book to the advanced reader with a real passion for the stories of the ancient aspects of the search for the kingdom.
2,this is not the cd I wanted,"I thought I was getting the original motion picture ""SPEED"" but I got this one. This cd is not bad but it is not as good as the oficial ""SPEED"" sound track by far."
1,Great SW with a big technical problem for XP SP2,"This is an excellent program. My daughter uses it at school and loves it. However, when I installed it on her laptop (she has a limited user account under Windows XP Service Pack 2.), I received an error message ""Could not create file for system settings."" I went to the Broderbund website and found a technical note (ID: 39783)for this problem. The instructions work for XP prior to SP2, but they are completely useless under SP2. As a result, my daughter completes a set of lessons and, instead of moving on to the next lesson, the programs throws her back anywhere from 5 to 15 lessons. This has been sufficiently discouraging that she has given up on the program. The Broderbund site has no facility to send a question or inform them of a problem. I'm hoping someone from Borderbund will see this review and post a fix to their website. Without a fix for this problem, I'm stuck and this program unfortunately becomes a waste of time and money."
1,"Horrible Product, even worse graphics, zero support","I'm a Mac user and it is beyond me how this program is ranked number one. Horrible graphics, lame GUI and finding support...good luck.You have been warned... DO NOT BUY THISMavis Beacon v16 equals complete junk!"
2,Will NOT let me progress.....,"I read the previous reviews about the problems people were having, however, I bought the program anyway, hoping I would be one of the lucky ones. No such luck. I have seen other Mavis Beacon programs so I knew it was exactly what I wanted. For a while, it was. The program taught me all the basic keys, but, then it quit acknowledging my success. No matter how perfect I do the lessons, it WILL NOT move on and keeps making me review the same lesson. The same problem another reviewer wrote about earlier. I have looked everywhere for a fix, but, cannot find one. I have removed/reinstalled the program, tried everything I could think of. To say I am discouraged and frustrated is an extreme understatement. I am sure I would have given it 5 stars had the program continued as it began. However, it is terribly lame to buy a typing program that fails to provide typing lessons :("
1,No technical suport for software? Crazy!,This is one of the very few companies that provides no technical suport at all. Do not buy it!!
1,Are there any other Network Typing programs out there?,"One reviewer says that Mavis Beacon 16 hasn't discovered Windows. I concur. Running 16 Network on Windows 2000 P4 and it runs dog slow. What is it doing? Re-sort a progress report with 25 students by clicking on a column tab and the program goes out to lunch. Not to mention that it takes over the computer like it was DOS (maybe it is running DOS). It has some odd launcher program. THe instructions are measly and miserly. No instructions on how to setup on a network until you read the technical notes. Wrong place buddy. That stuff belongs in the primary docs, like a Getting Started section. I agree ""run from this"". Find something better."
1,Mavis Beacon Typing Version 16 for Dvorak on Mac,"Publisher said only Mavis Beacon Version 15 &16 DVD had Dvorak keyboard tutorial. Did not find Dvorak on it except a reference. No tutorial. Not for Mac.My opinion is buy only latest which I think is 20 or near latest. Only for PC. All earlier versions should be scrapped.This thread will take you to a free tutorial that seems excellent for my Mac. It may do well on PCs, too.[...]I paid only about $4 for a new DVD Version 16, not much change from 15, they say. With shipping was only about $8.I will scrap my version 16.Latest versions are great for PCs."
1,M. Becon 16 won't instll to Vista,I got new Sony Vaio with Windows VIst. When I tried to install MBTT 16 it cted like there ws no CD in the drawer.
2,Maybe next time ...,"The Clio was a good idea, but doesn't meet expectations. The passive matrix screen is difficult to read. The keyboard is small and curved making touch-typing difficult. The unit itself is a bit heavy and ackward to lug around compared to some of the latest (and smallest laptops). With a max resolution of 800x600, images and video look cheap. There are NO output ports on the unit itself - you have to hard-link to a computer even to print! No VGA-out for use with a projector. Not even a PS-2 or USB port! The handwriting recognizer works about 3/4 of the time. That is, in a page of handwritten notes, you'll have to manually correct about 1/4 of the page. It does slightly better on single words or sentences. My recommendation: Take the [amt] that you'd spend on the Clio and add to it the [amt] you'd spend on a Pocket PC and buy a decent laptop."
4,fun to watch,"I've attempted over the years to watch the Hunchback of Notre Dame in it's entirety, but never quite made it until I finally ordered the dvd. I really enjoyed this movie even though it appears to be scratchy. I recommend this dvd to old school horror fans. It's worth buying."
3,great,just like old movies and this is great is kept on my shelf and watches every now and then wonderful
3,the top is not a tight seal,The top does not seal tightly. I am disappointed based upon the cost. But it does keep the coffee hot for a long time.
1,The lid ruins it,"The body is very sturdy, but the lid is flimsy and poorly designed. If you don't keep the tumbler perfectly level at all times, you'll get quite a bit of spillage. Unfortunately, the whole purpose of a travel mug is to prevent spills."
1,Disappointed,The lid does not screw down. Felt like it would easily fall off.The top slide part leaks when tumbler is tipped.I sent this back to Amazon as soon as I tried it out. Amazon refunded my charge immediately -Thank you Amazon for standing behind your customers.
2,"Good bag, but not the best cart bag","We play a lot of golf and my husband was needing a new cart bag. I bought this after careful research. After one day on the course, he is trading it in. He had trouble reaching for items in the side pockets with 2 bags on a cart. The top club holders were great but he could not easily gain access to items he needed. Only the pockets and cooler on the front were easy to reach. Back to the search."
2,"BAD OPENING, TRIVIAL PURSUIT","Unbearable beginning. Who ever told this woman she could write? Nothing about the set-up works. The characters and the plot are trivial, and the floating point of view is ungrounded. There is no sense of a central intelligence behind the story. Yarrrrgh. I lasted only 11 pages. I'm being kind to give it two stars. If people in Hollywood are like this, I'm glad I'm not there. I remember seeing Kelly Lange on TV, too, and thought she was pretty good. I think it's hard to make the transition from journalism to fiction, which is much more demanding. For her, it didn't go well."
2,Oh The Replacement Blades,The saw is OK. It has worked adequately for my applications. But my blade is getting worn. Like others I have scoured the internet for blades. After opening a call with Stanley Tools I was provided the following link.[....]I'm not thrilled about the price.
2,Why no replacement blades????,"Handy little saw to carry around in the tool caddy. Not as nice for trim work as either larger japanese (draw) style saws or traditional back-saws. But why can't we buy replacement blades? It's clearly designed for replaceable bldes with a large retainer screw. I now have two nice handles, about to become trash. I will not buy another."
1,Downgrade because of lack of blades,"Yes, I have to echo the other reviewers and say that it doesn't matter if the saw is good or not. Without EASY access to replacement blades, it's a waste of money. In my case the blade bound up and snapped off at the handle on the 2nd use and I can't find a replacement blade."
2,What a waste!,"The flush cut saw is a good tool having a thin blade with in line teeth. The blade slips into very small crevices and cuts that last little bit of wood that you normally can't get at. Unfortunately, once the blade is worn the whole saw is expendable because of the replacement blade price. Stanley carries the blade and prices it at three-quarters of the tool price. If you add in shipping and handling from Stanley then you have paid the same price as a new saw. It's a shame that the blades are not reasonably priced the same as hacksaw blades:("
2,Replacement blade price is a joke,"It's an OK little saw. It has it's place .... BUT ... replacement blades are only available directly from Stanley. This saw handle & blade is now about $13 on Amazon. The replacement blade from Stanley is $8. with shipping of $3. So, go figure. It makes no sense. Since Stanley is being difficult and expensive -- here's my suggestion: Get some other saw. It's likely to be better and have replacement blades more commonly available. As an aside: my Stanley 20-331 blade rusted much sooner than my other Japanese pull saws, therefore needing a replacement blade sooner. Yuk."
3,not Stanley Quality,Saw cut well enough but blade was very flexable. Did not have this saw very long and blade broke at the handle.
3,Not their best,I love HIM but this was not the best of their work. I like it but I have heard better by them.
2,Poser,This is an wful band. If you like psydo-romantic gothic then maybe you will like this album (but it is definetely not as good as the first one). I am a male and if ind these songs childish or for women. I dont like any song in this album. On the other hand they have some good songs in their first album and in Love metal which according to my opinion is their best till this day.
3,"Good album, but definitely not HIM's finest","Me being a fan of all H.I.M.'s music (but not a Bam Margera fan/wannabe/whatever) once seeing this album: Deep Shadows & Brilliant Highlights at the Virgin Records Megastore in NYC I immediately had to buy it. Listening to this album, though, got me a little dissapointed. Ville Valo's voice seemed out of place and unusual, and the tracks seemed more keyboards than any of the instruments. Though saying this, the album is pretty good. The best songs of the album are 'In Joy and Sorrow,' 'Close To the Flame' and 'Beautiful.' In advice, the album is kind of worth the buy, not worth the import price though."
5,Two Words: Perfect Music,Another great album from HIM and i swear they cant make a bad album!!! Great song's. BAM im glad you told me about HIM because they are the best band on earth..... p-e-r-f-e-c-t m-u-s-i-c
3,Not my favorite H I M album,"Deep Shadows & Brilliant Hightlights definately is not my favorite HIM album. I like this album, but not as much as their other albums. I have 5 HIM albums, and this one I have listened to the least. It just doesn't sound the same as the other 4, but I mentality is that, if I need a change in music, I have this one to go to."
3,Shallow Shadows & So-So Highlights,"Oh. My. God. I get it! HIM is the Finnish version of Creed! Just what the world needed ... another 30ish man singing lyrics that sound like they were written by a 14-year-old surburbian white girl. Wonderful.That said, I'm sure if high school students across America can step away from the overdone rap/hip-hop music that is being dumped on them, they'd really dig HIM. The same way kids like dead things and Good Charlotte.I totally think of my high school stalker's 'love letters' when I listen to this CD or Homer Simpson when he talks about attack dogs with killer bees in their mouths.Overkill and in the cheesiest way possible."
2,This is bogus,"HIM had its moments. Join Me was one of the best songs of the last few years, Gone With The Sin was thrilling, Poison Girl was marvelous.But the new album, Deep Shadows And Brilliant Highlights, is simply bogus. The same stuff all over again, a bunch of songs that were probably left out from the previous album, with absolutely nothing special. The proof? Although all songs are commercial, the first single of this album, Pretending, totally failed to be the hit it was supposed to be. And this will happend to the other singles from this album. Why? Because it's way worst than the first.Today's HIM is probably the most boring and predictable band of the world. All songs sound alike, and worst of all, all lyrics sound alike. I never can listen to more than 2 songs without getting bored."
2,Sounds fake,"While Razorblade Romance was fun(in its own way), mixing goth-rock with glam Billy Idol post-punk melodies,this one is just a pathetic, melo-dramatic copy of RR.It sounds fake, there are no emotions in any of the titles what so ever.The album should have been called""Chick flick and other stories for depressed teenagers"".Him should stick to a more glam-rock music..."
5,Another HIM classic,"I'm a fairly new HIM fan, and in the short 3 months I've even known about them they've in my mind went from being completely unknown (other than a few Viva La Bam episodes), to being my favorite band. This album is excellent, as are all of their albums, the songs are beautifully crafted, with deep, meaningful lyrics. Many people have the misconception that you'll only like HIM if you're goth, this is not true at all. I'm not goth and I think HIM is the best band in the world right now.Best song: In Joy and Sorrow"
5,great album,"well, i just found out about HIM and i think they're a great band. They have all it takes to make excellent songs: great music and great lyrics.Yeah, this album is softer than the other two and i think probably the best one is razorblade romance, but this one is an excellent album, all the songs are great and i think ville valo is an amazing singer with a great voice.Anyone who likes good rock will like HIM."
4,Great record for a great band,"I think this is one of the best expression of the HIM thought; the tracks you can find are very strongest and very full of a darkest harmony, rightly acccompained to the lovable voice of the sex simbol Ville Valo, that shows what the first nighly '80 years have teached by the pop music. Favourite track? No favourite track, greatest gems all over the album."
5,H.I.M Kicks so much a@#,I know that alot of H.I.M fans are based around Bam Margera which is really pathetic. But these guys are very talented musicians. Valo has such an origanal voice. These was my first H.I.M cd. I stumbled apon it at my local record store. I bought and was instently in love with it and still am. The quality of these album is extremly good. The lyrics are amazing. The vocals are incredable.
1,Euro Trash,"This band is absolute trash! Some of the worst music I've ever heard. I love the CKY videos but Bam should have stuck with just CKY for the soundtracks or better yet have Brandon DiCamillo make up more songs. H.I.M. must stand for Horrible Idiotic Music because it sounds like the worst noise imaginable. Imagine a dump truck backing up at 7am with the ""beep beep beep"" noise topped off with dragging a metal dumpster along the asphalt, just grinding away what's left of your ears and giving you a headache. That's what HIM sounds like.Wake up kiddies and teeny boppers, just because you love Bam Margera doesn't mean you have to love his favorite band too! THINK FOR YOURSELF! This music is HORRIBLE! Notice how Raab, Rake, Bran and the rest of the crew never sport HIM attire? Can you actually call yourself a fan after watching what a tool the lead singer is? He looks like more of a flamer than Siegfried & Roy, only not as tan. Excuse me while I go puke..."
2,Not very tasty,"It may be that I am not used to the taste of Stevia as compared with Splenda, but I did not care for this. Also, it wouldn't dissolve in the water. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Good Product,"I enjoyed Stevia, especially the flavored Stick Packs. I use it in my water bottles and in tea for added flavor and sweetness. I also use the individual packs as they are easy to carry for traveling. This is one product that does not contain aspartame as is Splenda and Equal. This product is my choice of artificial sweetners."
4,Lime Magic,"This is a drink that you do not want to follow their instructions, it is too bland sweet and too strong. What I did find great was to use a little mixed in plain yogurt or added with organic sugar when making cookies, mixed a little in my soy milk too. I am sure it can be used in many other different ways. Time will tell. I liked the orange flavor the best."
5,A first time listener!,"I just got turned on to The Samples from a friend, and I love their music! It is so fresh and live! I plan to run out and buy their album today! Thanks, Rosey for the recommendation!"
5,soul moving.feel good mountain surfing peace,The Samples are easily one of the best bands to never make it to mainstream hype. Those who appreciate the talent and lyrics from the band truely can feel The Samples for who they are. Andy Sheldon is amazing and their music is a perfect accompanyment to great day of snowboarding.
3,A good piece yet incomplete.,"""Fold es eg"" is a very enjoyable album yet it lacks the connection between the songs and the atmosphere as ""overground music"" and ""the insulted and injured"" .BUT - do not mistake by believing that this is a bad album , this is still After Crying and you can never miss that special style . the beginning is great and kinda slows down as the tracks continues until you reach the final track and - WAOW! the last track is one of the most atmospheric and inspiring song I heard,ever! worth it all."
3,Good waste of time during winter months,This OAV isn't art by any means. To make matters worse it is an ecchi anime to top it all off. But it does certainly give the winter months a theme.
5,Beautiful and light-weight,"I bought this for my husband. It is a gorgeous watch! I have had a Tissot for years and love that the watch face never scratches. The band scratches, but that kind of adds to the look of the titanium watch. This watch is light-weight and beautiful. Very classy. Very sleek.I hear the batteries can be pricey to replace, but we don't have any experience with that, yet."
1,"bad buy, avoid buying this one!!!","I bought this watch for $230.00 dollars thinking that I would not buy another watch for a very long time, however that was not the case! The next day after wearing the watch for some 5 hours I noticed that the band was severely scratched (All I did was go to school and write notes). The crome plating comes off very easily and althought the scratches dont affect the watch's performance, it makes it very awful to look at... especially after it cost me $230.00 dollars.If I could return this watch I would do so in an instant. I would highly recomend you buying something different!"
5,Ah My Goddess Season 2,"It got here quickly, nothing wrong no scratches, and the cases for the dvd's are pretty different but still cool. Quite possibly the best anime ever!!!!!"
2,More like valve oil,"Although the price was very low, unfortunately, the quality was also. Having been a woodwind repairman and professional-level brass player for many years, I am familiar with what key oil and valve oil viscosity (for lack of a better word)should be. It is poosble that the bottle was mis-labled or there was a mixup in the manufacturing process. Anyhow.....it is too thin for woodwind key oil. Afraid to try it on my valves. Don't want to get them gummed up. I recommend not buying this product."
5,Practical advice by an experienced counselor.,"I enjoyed this book very much. I found it to be good, down to earth, practical advice on how to help people. It is written in every day language so that all can understand it, but Clyde's many years of experience come through. It is designed primarily for Christian workers to learn how to help the people that they serve."
2,"a lot of pictures, a little of information","I expected more information about wild edible plants, but the author just briefly scrolled through well known berries, mushrooms and plants.Good book for children and for people who know a little about nature."
3,Eh....it's okay....,"I do think that this is Byars' best book (though I haven't readher alleged ""classic"" The Not Just Anybody Family) butdespite some good characterization (all three major characters in the novel are developed very well and possess interesting traits), the plot is overall pretty bland in the way that generally characterizes her work. I still think it's okay, and it's certainly not a bad book, but I just don't think that it's anything special and doesn't seem to go anywhere-- a type of writing which works in some cases but just doesn't come off as impressive here."
3,Bravo!!!,"This was a very good book about three kids that go to live in a foster home. Harvey is a kid who's dad ran over his legs, Tomas J. is a kid who lived with twins until they got thier hips broken, and Carlie is a kid who's stepfather abused her. It was a really good story but it could have had a little more description"
5,A Good-Hearted Book.,"This book was a good read. Although some parts are a little bit slow, this book comes through towards the end. I recommend this book to anyone who is about 8 years old to 12 years old. -J.C.P."
5,Cool!!!,"I really liked this book and I encourage some students to read it. It is about these three kids that go into a foster home. There are three main characters and their names are Carlie,Thomas J, and Harvey. I would like anyone to read this wonderful book."
5,Totally Wonderful Book,"We had to read this book over the summer and do questions and pages and pages on this book but I hated the idea of it in the summer. Well it turns out I read the book and I loves it. I'm 11 and I enjoyied it so much. Harvey,Carlie,Thomas J. and and all the main people are wonderful. If I had to recommed a book this would be it."
5,Powerful Writing,"We read this book as a family, my six year old, ten year old, twelve year old, my husband and myself. We were all captivated by the story. The book is very thought provoking and brings up a lot of issues for discussion. My husband was a little disappointed with the ending but I thought it was perfect. The kids all really enjoyed it."
5,Still my favorite,"I first read this book, when I was in third or fourth grade. Now, I am 14 and I still love to read this book from time to time. I love the fact that Carly is so defensive at first but in the end, is caring. All of them have qualities that you can relate to. I have read, many, many books and this is still my favorite."
5,Powerful Writing,We read this book as a family... We were all captivated by the story. The book is very thought provoking and brings up a lot of issues for discussion. My husband was a little disappointed with the ending but I thought it was perfect. The kids all really enjoyed it.
4,Pinballs,"I think this book was a little scary in the begining, but in the end it was a very good book and was worth to take the time for. I think that a lot of people would enjoy this book. I thought that the Mason's would adopt them and that they will always be together, but I guess I was wrong. I also think they should make a better ending instead of walking home. I read my mom the first chapter and she wouldn't let me read any more because she thought it was so sad. I think that they should have had Carlie run away and then come back because she realizes that she misses the Mason's and Carlie and Harvey so much."
1,I didn't like the Pinballs,"Pinballs was not a very well written book. It got boring at points, and this was not the best the author could have done."
1,BORING,I read this book at school and I found it way to easy to read and ridiculous. The plot went no where and after a few days I was so bored with it that if it hadn't have been for a school assignment i would have put it down. Don't read it you'll fall asleep!
1,Welll...not the best,"I found this book fairly boring. All of the characters seemed to bore me. Everything they said seemed to boil down to the same thing. I wouldn't really reccomend this book to other kids. I had trouble keeping my attention on the book, which rarely happens to me."
2,SHOCKED,My daugther 4th grade started telling me the story of this book. How one of the boys got runned over by his own dad with his car and cant walk?!!! is my daughter telling me what actually happened? is this the kind of book a 4th grader should be reading? sounds more like a book to scare them...scared me!
2,Bad,I hated it no detail no funny parts and to be honest i had to bribe my self to finish it it was so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Hungry for a better book,"Some extremely interesting (and concisely reported) material trapped in what I found to be a boring narrative. Basically, whenever the POV switched to the not-so-very-interesting experiences of the author, the book lost whatever momentum it had gained as a lesson on the subject of hunger."
5,"Thought-provoking, intriguing and easy read","Great introductory book that opens your eyes to the misfortune of many who have, do and will suffer from voluntary and involuntary hunger. The author's ideas and thoughts are backed up with science, yet the book is an easy read for the layperson. If this book really grabs your attention, the author cites a wealth of sources to learn more about hunger. Highly recommend this book!"
1,deceitful title,"I gave only one star for this book because of the dishonesty of theauthor and/or editor in the selection of the title: A Player's Guide toChords & Harmony.On page 3 the author says that ONLY pianists can derive something from thebook because they're the only musicians that play chords. The author claims that guitarists don't play real chords(Maybe we play ""knock-offs""!) So shouldn't the title be A Pianist's Guide to Chords & Harmony?This author is also extremely depreciative of other musicians. He thinks,for instance, that drummers are stupid people that can't be arrested as real musicians and therefore had no other choice but turn to drums and make noises instead of music. And the funny thing is that we learn from the back cover that this author ""composes"" music on the synthesizer. Well now,Mr. Aikin, do you uses electronics and call yourself a musician?"
1,Didn't stay stuck,"Got these for the steps on our deck. After the first snowfall, they came off as soon as a shovel scraped them. There's a paint at Home Depot that makes your steps less slippery. I'll get that this spring. I'd advise a prospective buyer to only use this product indoors, if at all."
1,Did not work outdoors,"I would NOT recommend sticking these outdoors. They may work fine indoors but, they came off our steps the second morning they were on."
4,A little quirky and unpredictable.,"Melodic British alternative pop. Jaunty, bubbly, feel-good confections. Not a bad song in the bunch. A little quirky and unpredictable. I can't even remember now which of the songs made some rounds on the radio but just about any of them could have been put up for a hit."
5,EVEN BETTER THAN I HAD HOPED!,"I'm a professional Make-up artist and purchased this to combine a lot of my shadows/blushes into one palette and it worked wonderfully! I'm very happy with the quality and how thin it is. I highly recommend, especially for the price!"
2,Please be aware that this is PAPER.,"I thought that this was going to be a plastic palette, but it is just pressed paper. While it might work for most people, from my professional standpoint I can not spray it down with alcohol to sanitize my shadows and the case between clients because I know over time it will cause the paper to degrade."
2,Some of the lens shows up in the picture,I have a Canon HF-100 camcorder. A small part of the right side of the lens shows up in the picture. I zoom just a tad and it is no longer a problem.
1,The Pagemaster Pageblaster,"The magic does not end when the credits appear on screen, this warm heart warming fantasy brings the world of Richard Tyler. This product has a part to play for evreyone. With simple but enchanteding wounderus music composed by favorite music maker James Horner."
4,Clio is great,"I own a Vadem Clio and I love it. With a built in modem and the Microsoft Pocket Office software it is the perfect companion to a traveler who doesn't want to lug around a laptop or can't afford one. Its very lightweight and the power cord is very small so it can easily fit inbetween items in your suitcase as well.The only downside is that like other laptops, if something integrated into the device stops working (ie. the modem) it can get very costly. I did, however, find a way around this and learned that there is a PCMCIA port on the Clio where you can just plug in a standard laptop modem or any PCMCIA device!"
1,Tiny Car,"I bought it as a gift for my son, and laughed out loud when I opened the package and saw how small it was. Not much bigger than the cap to a felt marker."
5,fun for me too,"I wasn't too fond of Fun For Me, but his song is very good. My fav mix is by Boris Dlugosch... what a great tune!"
5,The freshest piece of music I've heard so far this summer,"This Moloko's new single is absolutely a killer, very very groovy, deep bass, sensual vocals. Infectious!"
5,Best Summer 99' melodic song to remember,"If you have not bought it yet, you should do it quickly before the label runs out of stock. The radio and club mixes are a must have and best to remember this last summer of the millenium. Becomimg more and more popular at the end of the summer, it is the rite for DTPM and Fruit Machine in London and Ibiza. Sing it back. Bring it back.. bring it back to me... (Tom this is the song you'll never forget!!) Stefano"
5,Complete basic marketing course as only DK can present it,I found this book at the library and read it before buying a copy to have as a reference and training tool. The material is well-presented in steps and complete. DK books are reliably wonderful that way!
2,Uninspired,"The Loved Ones self-titled EP seems to start off with promise but leaves the listener a little flat. 100K is a decent pop-punk tune but it's been done to death countless times before. Throw some power guitar chords, a bridge or two, and breakdown that builds up to the chorus and you have yourself a punk hit. While the formula works (and will continue to work as long as angst-filled teenagers open their Hurley velcro wallets in support of these bands) it doesn't satisfy anyone looking to find an original sound. The song Chicken is along the same lines as 100K, but isn't nearly as good. Massive and Drastic display the Loved Ones' attempted serious songwriting skills but act mostly as filler, while Candy Cane finishes up the EP with notes and chords you've heard on every marginal punk record. While I can't say the album is terrible, it is terribly unoriginal."
1,Don't buy PROFORM!!! Poorly made! Bad Customer Service!!,"I got this machine for my birthday. During my first use, I noticed that the resistance was not working. I reported it to ProForm. They sent someone out to repair it in a little over a week. When the repair guy came out, he took it apart but could not fix it! He left it in 20 pieces in the middle of the room and left. After 2 weeks of trying to get a hold of ProForm, they informed me that it would be cheaper to replace than repair. They demanded a receipt. But it was a gift and I don't have a receipt... so now... 3 months later... it is still sitting in pieces in the middle of the room. We have spent over 40 hours over the phone with them. Lately, they don't even answer the phone anymore.When we did finally get a hold of someone, they told us that they now want $150 to repair/replace it!!Buyers beware!!!"
2,Problems with...,"I own a Pro-Form CardioCrossTrainer800 purchased in Spring 2005 (an earlier version of this model). I was extremely pleased with the machine (especially the fan) UNTIL 8 months in when the resistance just stopped functioning. Because the resistance is magnetic and controlled by the computer consol (electronics), there is no way to manually adjust the resistance. I had repair techs out three times to my house and they were unable to find or solve the problem. Currently the machine is holding my garden hoses and collecting dust in my garage. Maybe they've fixed this in the newer model but be careful!!"
2,Guess its broken for good,"HI Bought mine for $500, it worked for a few months and now the program setting wont work, so its set on hardest resistance (useless). At first we thought the batteries were dead, well nooooo, Ive taken it apart, all wires and in contact, the little motor that changes the resistance still works, so its a mystery to me, Im not so sold on proform products now..."
1,Proform = Bad Product,"Like many of the other users with reviews here, I purchased a ProForm CardioCross Elliptical Trainer because of the price and the fact that I wasn't going to use it all the time. Biggest mistake ever. It has been one problem after another with this thing. So far, I've replaced the main console, the right crank arm twice, the left crank arm, the crank, and a few other ""less expensive"" parts. Icon, the company that makes ProForm, knows they make a sub-standard product and they don't care. Customer service is useless and they refused to honor any warranty. STAY AWAY. THE PRICE ISN'T WORTH IT. YOU'LL SPEND MORE IN THE LONG RUN THAN IF YOU JUST BUY A QUALITY PRODUCT."
1,Never buy Proform or any product associated with Icon Health & Fitness,Extremely disappointed! Great price and they allowed payments with no interest. They do not honor their 30 day money back guarantee.It was one problem after another. I rec'd a damaged unit. Then the console didn't work. Unit wouldn't turn off. Resistance motor quit working. You can't get a customer service rep when you need help. I left messages and sent emails. I was REFUSED 30 day money back guarantee. They sent a tech out 3 times to attempt to fix it. Tech contacted Icon and they couldn't help him. I had my elliptical four months before they decided to replace it. I had to file a BBB complaint to get a replacement unit. Rec'd replacement unit that doesn't work properly. Now customer service won't return phone calls or emails. I filed another BBB complaint.I bought this equipment 11 mos ago and it's only been usable for maybe 4 months.
5,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"I really enjoy listening to this particulur album by Chemlab. In my opinion, it is thier absolute best work. The music is best explained as coldwave industrial rock. The songs are mostly violent and aggressive in nature...all verry well done. It's worth every damm penny!"
1,Worst CD ever,"Let me tell you whats wrong with this CD. It's Obnoxious, Chemlab is getting fat off Hee's cooking, It's boring and so many times during when I was listneing to it I became annoyed. the singer kept saying Yeahhhhhh!!!!!! a real waste of money"
5,Excellent,Great product. I find alot of great things but this is a really good product and i find it well worth the money.I do not normally do reviews but this is well worth the effort.TammyTn Plant Nursery[...]
2,Wordy,"Disappointed with the book. May be a good read for someone who is a Theologian, but hard to follow for the average lay person. The writer uses language that the common Christian does not use in there daily life, nor hear in Church or Sunday School. This makes it very hard to stay focused on what you are reading. I've read paragraphs sometimes three times to find the main topic. Here is an example of what I mean quoted from the book. ""John's original variation of the salutation in 1:4b - 5a strongly suggests that his understanding of the divine is deliberately 'trinitarian'."" Maybe it's just me, but it seems like this is not an easy statement for the average reader to grasp."
5,Intelligibility brought to the unintelligible,"This is just plainly an excellent book. Bauckham shows very plainly the Theo-logicity, of the book of revelation, as well as it's excellence as a continuance of Jewish apocalyptic tradition, not to mention, the understanding of the bible and mission of the Church as a whole. The book becomes a challenge though. Not in understanding or in reading, but in putting your faith to work in witness!Revelation afterwords looks so simple, one wants to smack their head and say D-oh!"
5,For any Serious Study of Revelation!,"Bauckham's essay of Revelation is thought provoking and spiritually challenging. His analysis of Revelation through the lens of ""apocalyptic genre"" gives pause to readers who are of a dispensational bent. He has a strong grasp of the 1st century influences that seemingly competed with Christian piety. To put it plainly, this book puts Revelation in context from beginning to end, while defying the more popular interpretations of today. It is a definite read for the seminary student, scholar, and layman alike."
4,Useful Text / Big Picture Perspective,"This book came as required reading for a class in graduate school and helped reveal the overarching messages in the book of revelation. This book has been one that has perplexed me since I was a young believer. Is this book to be taken literally? Is the book figurative? Is it somewhere in-between? Bauckham falls into a general examination of the book, looking at the genre, the big issues, the themes, and specific issues that scholars debate in all circles. This book is not an exegetical painful process, rather a good look at the big picture of revelation. How should we apply it today? Are we afraid that we will be 'left behind?' Thank goodness Tim Lahaye made a DVD for those people who will be 'left behind.' Anyway, on a more serious note, this book is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and will help almost anyone get around the book without feeling overwhelmed or lost. Highly Recommended - Joseph Dworak"
4,Not for me...,I ordered this upon a special request from a niece. It came from a supplier in Germany and did not appear as an original but rather a home-made copy. As this was a gift requested by a 15 year old I did not make a big deal but if it were for me I would not have accepted it in the condition it came. No comments about the music. Nothing that I would have ever heard otherwise.
3,"sometimes better, sometimes worse","I am one of the few people in my dept that buy each and every edition of this book, but it seems that I can't throw away the older ones, in may subjects it seems to be getting better, specially when you are talking about genes or dealing with cancer, but in other areas it is getting worse, like dealing with vocal fold paralysis or sleep apnoea."
3,acceptable,"I was disappoited on buying the CD-ROM version of this text. I found it incomplete (ie NO mention on Otoplasty despite being advertised by the authers as the MOST comprehensive text in this field !, and I found it innacurate with plenty of mistakes.It is otherwise a versatile instrument for reference and revisionThere is no access to the authors for feedback comments etc."
2,i am resident of ENT and this book is my text fpr all exam,this book is my text and have using for all of my grading examination. this is directed to especiality of laryngology and in compare with other books in otolaryngology have lesser about otology(see chpt.160:otosclerosis). I find many mistake on it!! overall I like this book & I read it every day& I know and remember all on the book!! because i read it more than 5th in my course.
3,Crazy Stacey,"This isn't one of the best BSCs in my opinion but it's still cool as they all are.Stacey and Mary Anne are having a great beach vacation as Mothers Helpers for the peculiar Pike Family.I really love the Pikes.Who wouldn't be in that family!!?Stacey is flirting with an older guy,or 2."
3,Unrealistic but fun,"I used to absolutely LOVE the Baby-sitters Club books. Now that I'm 13 and in eighth grade myself, I realize how unrealistic that book is. Although I enjoyed the book, my teenage perspective gives me new insight. No one I know would think that he liked her. He was 17! If Stacy was as experienced as the books make her out to be, she would have A)realized from the start that she didn't have a chance and B)realized that he didn't like her when all he asked her to do was feed him. Overall, though, I did enjoy the book because she does meet Toby(who was more realistic). Go, Stacy!"
4,magic as escape,"This movie, made in 1999, could have been a precursor to Pans's Labyrinth for all its similarities: a child uses her imagination as the only escape from brutality; someone she loves abandons her, someone is presumed guilty for an offence he did not commit, the child keeps a secret to protect an adult, and at the end everything makes more sense.My version is from desert mountain media and the subtitles were great.I thought the story was compelling, the actors were good, the ""magic"" made sense (rather than just functioning as an add-on), the photography was great, and the peek into Mexican culture was interesting to me (I am a gringuita). My only criticism is that the part in the beginning (at the hotel) didn't seem to me to fit into the overall movie as well as it could have, but it was really a relatively minor flaw, and it may not even be a flaw to others. I'm glad I bought it."
5,Looks good so far,While this trap was on order I actually caught the mouse with a homemade trap so I haven't actually tried it yet. However I think this trap has a great chance of success because of 2 factors. First the trap is large so I'm hoping it won't spook mice from entering. I've tried several traps where the mouse won't enter and I believe it's because these traps were too small. Second the trigger mechanism appears to be very sensitive. Large size and sensitive trigger mechanism. I think that is the key.Update: I realized I had more mice so I set the happy trap up in the attic. Within 30 minutes I caught a mouse. Over the last few days I've caught almost 10. Works great!
2,Well that sucked!,"So apparently if the mice are small, and arent they all, then the mice might be too light to set the trap off. After three days, the mice had eaten all the the food and the trap didnt go off at all. The only other reason could be that the mice are walking around the trigger to reach the food. I am pretty certain they have stepped on the trigger from the little mice print on the trigger. I have not been able to catch any mice yet. I will try setting the trigger as sensitively as I can and then I will try the suggestion made by clover from SC... I had a cheap live mouse trap from the ""old country"" and it worked ten times better. How disappointing..."
1,no luck yet,I'm not sure if it's me or the trap but I've yet to catch any chipmucks with this trap --- on the bright side they are enjoying the lovely snacks I leave for them !
5,Love it.,"Within 30 min, I caught one chipmunk. Within 2 days, I caught 3. I used dry guava ( bought from oriental market) and dry corn as bait. I let them go any way, 2 miles from my house in the wood. I don't want to kill them. I love this product. It's so awesome."
3,"B+ for design, D for materials","The design of the trap is very good. I have caught 3 squirrels with it. However, that is about the total life expectancy for the trap (3 trappings). The cause of the short life expectancy is due to material deficiency. The trap is made from very flimsy metal resembling scrap recycled aluminum cans or soup cans.After the 3rd trapping, the trap is beyond repair. In fact, extensive repairs were necessary after each trapping due to the squirrel trying to chew its way out and bumping into the trigger mechanism. Another very important consideration is there are too many sharp corners and edges built into the trap. Every animal was bleeding from injuries sustained while in the trap.In conclusion, even if the trap was still usable I would be afraid to use it anymore due to its potential to maim the animal. My grade for this trap would be a `B+' for design, but a `D' for manufacturing and material choice."
2,Nice but they don't last long,"I've mounted 4 of these under our cabinets. They are nice and provide a nice level of light. However they do not even come close to lasting 40,000 hours."
2,Pretty useless since they don't last,"These lights are very well made, but badly engineered. The heat that they generate is captured within the fixture, which gets almost too warm to touch. The heat speeds up the degradation of the components and the lamps.For occasional use, they would be fine. And they look quite nice. For regular use, they are a terrible idea.I just began replacing a LOT of them that are used in display cabinets with LEDs..."
3,DESIGN NEED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT.,"Athough this does work and drys your hearing-aid as it claims, the pouch needs to be designed a little better. 1ST, the pouch is a bit difficult to roll up and snap shut. After folding and rolling as directed on the pouch the strap with that you snap it shut with is too short and you have a hard time snapping it shut. 2nd, there is no netting or snything to stop your hearing aid from hitting the metal dryer when you insert your aid in the pouch. It fall and hits the metal dryer, which is a shock that no hearing aid needs."
2,Hasn't worked,"I got it to keep the moisture out of my portable radio earpiece. It is a clear tube with several loops before the earpiece and the tiniest water drop will block the tube making it useless. I have two earpieces so I alternate them and during a three day tour it sits in the bag. It has yet to get the moisture out of the tube. I don't know if it would work better with a hearing aid, but it has not worked for the earpiece. Maybe it needs a week or so, but I was hoping it didn't. I guess try it out its pretty cheap so it shouldn't hurt the wallet too much."
3,the blade that couldnt get it done,I bought this product with the hope that Id be able to do tons of carpentry work and make life easier. It states on the package that it will fit any table saw. It DOES NOT. Even leaving the flange off there are no threads to even start the nut. Im sure it might be a good product but they either need more instructions or realize it doesnt fit all table saws.
4,Good Effort,"This band seemed to be all the rage for a time in the prog rock world. I remember that they performed at BAJA prog and all over the prog press and internet people seemed to be going ga ga over their performance. This is a studio album from them (I assume their 6th). I have not listened to this album in a long time, but I like it for the most part. The main meat of the album consists of two long conceptual tracks ""Panem Et Circneses"" which has a circus / fair theme, and ""Farewell To 20the Century"". The album concludes with ""Conclusion"" which is a tribute to Keith Emerson. Most of the vocals on the album are in English which are obviously not this bands first language. The results are mixed with some of it coming across pretty good, but some sounding rather awkward, somewhat reminding me of CAST's English recordings. The music is symphonic in nature with Cello and Trumpet often used as lead instruments which makes this ensemble unique. Overall an enjoyable album."
2,Worst I've heard from them,"There are a few other albums to make sure and get first! Overground Music, De Profundis, and ...They are always better when sticking to singing Hungarian (at least the men). Here they also try sounding more like an ELP, which for me doesn't work well. It's better than most rock, though. Not enough of their classical side on 6."
5,A Classic,This album is a classic - Mellencamp was ahead of his time when he released this superb album
5,All American Album,"Along with John Fogerty, Mr. Mellenkamp'c music is the ballad of our daily LIFE in the GREATEST country in the universe, by far, The God Blessed UUUUnited Staes of America. And this is one his best. Rock on dude."
5,Seminal bluegrass album,"Like it or not, many listeners found their way to the great recordings of Ralph Stanley, Jim & Jesse, and Bill Monroe via the unexpected offramp of the Grateful Dead; that is, because this record had the name Jerry Garcia attached to it (never mind the other great players in the band), it became a must-own. (For other examples of this phenomenon, see ""Merle Saunders, career of."") That said, this really is an album that captures the spirit of bluegrass's energy, and it is possible that Garcia, in between Dead projects, unwittingly made things easier for J. D. Crowe, Tony Rice, Norman Blake, Ricky Skaggs, Alison Krauss ..."
5,Wonderful bluegrass music!,"Wow! Who would have thought that the blend would be so incredible. A fantastic version of The Stone's ""Wild Horses"" and the New Rider's ""Panama Red"" are just some of the more familiar songs this album deals with. Clemens fiddle work carries the album, but all contribute to develop a delightful bluegrass mix. If you like Jerry Garcia, The New Riders of the Purple Sage, or bluegrass, you have to give this album a listen."
5,Great/historic bluegrass CD.,"Entertaining live bluegrass cd with Jerry Garcia and friends David Grisman, Peter Rowan, Vassar Clements, John Kahn. Cd has pretty good sound quality considering when and how it was recorded. Although this cd has been re-issued a couple or so times it is currently out of print. I also want to add that it is nolonger available from Clements website so be ready to pay some extra bucks for a good used copy."
1,Cheap Bostonian Shoes,"I have bought Bostonian shoes for years now and have always been a happy customer. When I received these shoes I was surprised at how cheap they looked. For the price, you would expect a nice classy leather upper. Instead, these ""leather uppers"" appear to me as cheap vinyl made to look like leather. I honestly don't believe they are leather. Doesn't smell like it. Doesn't feel like it.Also, I ordered my normal size and the fit is way too big. Not snug and comfortable but like the very cheap and very wide shoes you buy at Walmart from the no-brand shelf. You can't pull the shoelaces tight enough to stop the shoe from moving around your foot when you walk.I do not recommend these shoes. Looking close at them, they appear to be shoes that you should pay $10.99 for. Disappointing!"
1,Bostonian takes a turn for the worse,"I own these shoes and love them. Or I guess I should say... I own the old pair of these shoes, Made in italy, and I loved them. Bostonian now manufactures these in India. The new shoes are inferior in every way. The leather is sub par, the quality sucks, and they are uncomfortable. I would by 2-3 more pair of the old high quality italian built shoes. But I might never by Bostonian again after seeing they way they are heading. It's a shame really."
3,Decent shoe at a decent price,"Fairly comfortable shoe with average quality for the price range (I've owned better from Bostonian but at a higher price). I found they initially irritated my heel because they are lower than the previous shoes I wore. However, I tend to always have an issue with any new shoe for a few days, so others may not have the same problem. I wore them on and off for a week and now have no issues wearing them every day."
2,No longer the same quality,"As some of the previous reviews have mentioned, now that the manufacturing moved from Italy, the shoe quality doesn't live up to the Bostonian name. I have worn the Italian version 12W for many years and it finally started cracking across the ball of the foot.Hoping that the previous reviews were exaggerating, I ordered a 12W of the current shoe. When I tried it on, it was extremely tight (like an 11W), but the markings showed it was a 12W. Additionally, the workmanship and materials were not up to the original Italian version. It's now quite a Payless shoe, but it's not a Bostonian either.The Italian version was worth $100. I would have expected this one in the $20 range. If you've worn the Italian version, don't bother with this one. You won't be happy."
1,Terrible design of the Bostonian shoes!,"It is my first try to buy shoes on Amazon, but it may be the last. The design of the shoes is terrible! Wearing the shoes for one day really hurt my feet, my ankle is swelling now! It is really disappointing!"
4,Another great childrens movie,"This movie is a bit out there, but still quite enjoyable to watch.Who we think of as the ""baddies"", end up not being so bad at all.Another great childrens movie."
4,A great movie!,"Castle in the Sky was the second movie in a long line of awesome movies by Hayao Mizaki. It's old, but it still tells a great tale."
1,Mastered doesn't mean better,"The movie is the same as the 1986 production; however, the mastered version has altered many of the sounds as well as the script. To put this in perspective, take your favorite movie and blank out the best ""one-liners"" and you have this mastered version.I'd love to know where I can get an un-mastered version of this classic. I have sent this one back to Amazon and they have credited my money back."
4,Good movie for all,"To start off I am reviewing the Blu-ray edition and the first time I saw this movie was 2012. I have not seen the older editions(DVD or VHS) so I only have a frame of reference for this ""new"" edition. This is a fun adventure story, but as many of Hayao Miyazaki movies it has serious undertones. All my kids love to watch it as do I. If your a fan of ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind/Warriors of the Wind"" you will like this movie."
5,Hooked on Miyazaki,"I love this director's films. We started with Ponyo. Our granddaughter (age 4 1/2) loved it, never wanted to watch the others we purchased, however, each time we watch a new one, she loves it too. she loved Spirited Away, My Neighbor Tortoro. We just got her to watch Castle in the Sky, now she wants one for Daddy's house. I recommend all of these movies to any adult or child."
4,A Miyazaki Masterpiece!,"Castle in the Sky, also known as Laputa, is a fun movie full of magic, cool flying machines, and a unique storyline. It's suitable for all ages and a worthwhile purchase.Now that I've covered the essentials, there is one more thing I want to cover. As a guy who prefers to watch Miyazaki's films in the original Japanese with English subs (I'm not fluent in Japanese), I must say that I'm annoyed that the subtitles, or more appropriately, ""dubtitles"" do not match the original Japanese dialogue. Some of it's understandable, since Disney added some lines for the English version, but it bugs me that some sentences are completely omitted and that some of the spoken dialogue is very different from the subtitles. With that, I'll shut up now."
5,Wow. Another great movie.,"I recently watched Spirited Away and I loved it so much I have bought several other movies of Miyazaki.I have to admit that of the ones I've seen, Howls' Moving Castle is my favorite but all of them are worth watching.Castle in the Sky is about a young girl who needs to discover her ancestor's history in order to unlock a power that has fallen into the wrong hands. This is actually a really over simplified version of the plot, but that is the gist of it. As always, the movie is visually amazing. All of the Miyazki films make me feel like I am watching art in motion."
5,Great Movie/Great Seller,"I love all of Hayao Miyazaki movies, and now I'm trying to catch up with all the movies his has put out, that way when they come out, i will be on course to purchase each one when they are released. This was a great purchase, and a great movie. The seller was fast and treated me like I was at Nordstrom, when the product was wrong, they had not problem fixing it and sending me one that was right ASAP. When you make a purchase, make sure you use this seller, honest and satisfaction to your liking!!!"
5,Another great movie,"It's a very moving movie, it came in a beautiful box and It really wasn't that expensive... Could've been cheaper, but still worth it. It has everything a great Miyazaki movie should."
4,Castle in the sky,I really like Hayao's movies there creative and magically beautiful.The first one I saw was Spirited Away I fell head over heels in love with his movies after that and intend to buy more of his work.
5,Castle in the sky is for all ages,"I purchased this movie first for myself and then for my nephew when he told me repeatedly as it was his favorite movie in the world. This is a wonderful story about a young boy who who helps a young girl overcome the villians that want to steal her necklace and its powers for themselves. They join together and eventually sacrifice the power in the necklace to save the world. This movie would be loved by anyone that loved ""Howl's Moving Castle"". Great Japanese animation and wonderful and meaningful fun."
5,this film blew me away its the best iv ever seen WOW!!!!!!!!,i have never seen a film like this it is for deffinate the best yet. it combines heart stopping action with a heart stopping musik . i bet no1 would watch this film and say it was bad it is superb a PERFECT vid for your collection. its so good they should play it at the cinema ALL THE TIME!!!! miyasaki does not get the credit he deserves in his name should be on every persons lips. if this was reliesed now it would smash all records i would proboly see it a thousand times at least.
4,Only watch Japanese or French version with subtitles,One of our favorites for Miyazaki's movie. Disney completely destroyed its ambiance by adding unnecessary music and sound effect for English version. They also changed the theme of the movie by altering dialogues. PLEASE WATCH THIS WITH JAPANESE VERSION WITH SUBTITLES OR FRENCH VERSION. French version does not alter any of its original music score and its dialogue translation is very close to Japanese original. I could have given 5 stars if English version was better.
3,there's just something...,"~well, when one watched this movie in two launguages already, chinese and french, which had almost the same translations. yet when u get to the english version, boy, so many differences! ""i'll give u one minute""?? according to the chinese and french versions, it was ""three minutes"". in addition, the english version had sheeta spoke at where she wasn't suppose to (where she talked about her homes, which was found neither in the chinese nor the french versions). anyway, those were just one~~ of the few differences. so buyers beware, when u r watching this movie in english (yes, it's still a good one), just remember that what u hear is not neccesaire part of the orginal version!~"
5,Amazing story...,"This movie is great for all ages and can be enjoyed even by those who are not fans of anime. This movie is all about the story with some beautiful animation and beautiful music. This movie is near the top on my list of favorites, being my favorite of Miyazaki's works. The story provides both wonderment and comedy as you follow the adventure of two young people as they search for the answer to a mysterious floating castle. This movie is topped off by being supported by an all star cast of voice talents and provides characters that let you decide if they are good or bad. There are many loveable characters and the worlds are so colorful and filled with adventure. I highly recommend at least seeing this one once."
5,Castle in the Sky,"This was a delightful movie with a lot of the wonderful characters that are so prevalant in Mr. Miyazaki's cartoon features! Having been raised in the era of Disney, it is always fun to see features from other countries that have become as beloved as Mickey, Tinkerbell, and Snow White, just to name a few! Now I have a whole new world of cartoons to explore! Enjoy!"
2,Children with guns,"I was led to this movie by Spirited Away, which is truly magical, and I assumed that this one would be equally so. No doubt it is artistically worthy in many ways. But is it praiseworthy as a children's movie? Pazu is a kid waving a gun who participates in a military adventure. This I find poor content to which to expose kids, and morally objectionable. I wish I had known beforehand.Perhaps you will say that this is better than 99% of what else is out there, and perhaps that's true, but I don't think it affects the point. Sorry to rain on everyone else's parade.My rating is for the movie considered as a children's movie, which is how many will regard and evaluate it.Update of 12/25/2012 (please note recent events). I gather that, since I posted this review, many have not agreed with me. But I still find what is depicted in this movie distasteful."
2,Boring,"This is the 3rd Japanese animation I've watched. I didn't enjoy it much. I guess if you see one of these, you seen them all."
1,THIS MOVIE [...] BIG TIME!!!,THIS MOVIE IS NOT REALLY GOOD. THE ENG DUB [...] AND THE MOVIE IS JUST PLAIN OLD BORING. ITS CHILDISH SILLY AGGG I CAN'T STAND THIS MOVIE.
5,Revised English Edition,"Same great story as always.Just a quick FYI for other fans of this movie: This release's English version has been heavily edited from the previous version! Remember all the goofy pirate chatter? It's been edited out. The new score composed specifically for the English version? Reverted to the Japanese version.So if you were previously disappointed in the English dub, you may enjoy it this time. It's now essentially the same as the original Japanese version.Personally I am completely torn -- while I was a bit annoyed that they added in all that extra pirate dialogue, the voice actors were SO goofy and enjoyable. And I really did think that the new score was incredibly beautiful.I had been planning on giving away my old version. But I guess I'll be keeping it after all.(I'm referring toCastle in the Skyas the old/previous version, andCastle in the Sky: Special Edition - 2 Disc DVDas the new/revised version...since they both seem to share the same reviews)"
4,Great for 5+,"This is a great movie, I bought it for my 3 year old who loves Miyazaki's other filmsKiki's Delivery Service: Special Edition - 2-Disc DVDandPonyoa lot more. This movie did not go over as well for the 3 year old. But I am sure 5 and older will love this movie. It has a wonderful story.So 1) DO NOT buy for your three year old.2) DO buy for anyone 5-100."
3,Excellent movie - bad translation,"I had the good and bad fortune to see the premiere of the English dubbed version of this movie with friend of mine at a Science Fiction conference a long time ago.Good because he had an excellent grasp of the Japanese language and had seen the Japanese version; bad because he kept yelling at the screen ""That's not what they said!"". Not knowing much Japanese, I really couldn't tell if he was right or wrong, but it seemed that the movie didn't quite work the same way as it did when I watched it in Japanese. I owned a copy of the Japanese version of this movie and so I watched it again - there is definitely something different betwen the two. The original's just a bit longer (some of the more violent bits have been cut) and the voice acting is a whole lot better. Why is it that we always use adults for children's voices? Overall, the Americanized version just seems a bit blander.If you possibly can, try to see a copy of this movie in its original language."
3,Poor executed translation,"This is not my favorite Ghibli movie. It doesn't hold up quite as well as some of his other movies like Kiki or Totoro, but it is a very beautiful and fun adventure. Unfortunately, it is colored by a very poor translation.I watched the movie subtitled. Sometimes the subtitles would correspond to people that weren't talking. Other times, the subtitles would disappear before you get a chance to read it. There would even be dialog that was left completely untranslated! I'm pretty sure the subtitles (I am not referring to the English for Hearing Impaired option) is the text for the english dub which worked most of the time but at times was completely off.Overall I am very disappointed in this piece of work. It is a shame that such a classic film will be memorialized with such poor treatment."
5,"Miyazaki, your'e the best.","Castle in the sky is pretty much anything one would expect from a Miyazaki film. A great story and plot that's easy to understand, characters with unique personalities, and of course, major replay value. It wouldn't be Miyazaki without any of these features."
5,MASTERPIECE!! and DO NOT watch in DUBBED!,"This is one of Miyazaki's greatest masterpiece. To get the feeling of this masterpiece, you MUST... I repeat... YOU MUST WATCH it in original voices in subtitled (if you know Japanese, then no need of subtitle). DUBBED is terrible. Seems like Disney just picked someone from the street and do the voice acting.ALWAYS watch foreign films in original voice."
2,Too short to be worth much...,"This book is really a booklet, a tiny little document with 20 small pages of text. Though the information that it contains is good, there is so little that it is of negligible value. A few pages of simple text prevent Blue from engaging in any thoughtful depth. Rather, he throws out a few general concepts (debt is bad, buying expensive cars is bad, etc.) that should be common-sense. This might be a decent place to start for someone with virtually no understanding of basic financial principles, but even such a person will soon need to move on to something much more substantial."
3,Nice case with major flaw,"This case is good looking, made with quality leather and is fairly priced. However, there is a problem -- the cover is not recessed over the application buttons, and as a result the palm is often inadvertently turned on when placed in a coat pocket."
2,SUCKS,"The leather is ugly, the metal bar is useless, and worst of all... it doesnt even cover my Palm completely!!!"
5,Top Quality All The Way,"VERY high quality leather and superb looks. I have owned several different Palm V cases and this Dooney & Bourke is the best for my application. Adequate protection, extremely high quality look, feel, and touch, and, most of all, exceptional accessibility to the unit itself. I'm very pleased."
2,Great movie but very poor quality of video,"I saw this movie in the theater when I was very young and it is a really great movie. The streaming experince of this, though, was extremely poor because it was not put in a very good format. Bummer, wish it had been in HD."
1,Against A Crappy DVD Release Is More Like It.....,Once again we are treated to a crappy dvd release of this movie.One a daily basis we are treated to more God awful prints of movies because DVD companies don't seek out better clean prints of movies.I don't buy the DISCLAIMER at the beginning of the movie claiming that the print used was the best available.Surely someone has a crisp print of this film horded away.This movie is too good to get such awful treatment on DVD.The DVD format Is constantly being put to shame by rediculously bad prints put upon it.Come On people If your gonna release a movie on DVD at least find the DVD worthy print and use it.Pass on this release from EchoBridge It's no better than what is already out there.
4,child hood,"seen when i was a young boy, brought back good times, when we play cowboys and indians. real good movie"
1,Quality - less than a one-star,I have ordered HUNDREDS of dvds from Amazon and this one is the worst quality color that I have experienced.
1,against a crooked sky,the reproduction company TIMELESS MEDIA GROUP once again wants a fast buck. the picture quality is poor and the audio was not that good. the movie has the icon TMG inserted which is annoying. we pay good money for these dvds and expect better quality. from now on the gloves are off. dont waste money on dvds reproduced by TIMELESS MEDIA GROUP
2,Poor fuzzy picture quality.,"The movie plot was excellent. . . 5 stars, but the video quality made it not worth watching for us."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!,"Although the story is great and the actors are engaging, the quality of the video is:A P I E C E O F C R A P ! ! ! ! ! !Some dude must have video-taped this as a bootleg copy off of a 1980's VCR; the video even has a ""station bug"" that shows up every 15-30 minutes!The sound is horrible, the picture is grainy and changes colors - I could go on and on. For 18 bucks, I expected a real DVD, not this. I'd try to get my money back, but it's probably too late. So, I will just try to warn as many folks I can to steer clear of this product and manufacturer!!!"
1,against a crooked sky,i would not buy this dvd. the company timeless media group did not do very well making this dvd. the icon tmg is in the movie and the picture quality and audio is not very good
1,too small,do not purchase this item. I have a Dodge Stratus and this item didn't even cover half of my winshield. It's not worth the money.
3,Maid to Serve,"this is a slower story, compared to others of this author I have read, But still engaging, and well written"
5,TRUER WORDS NEVER SPOKEN...,"For those who diet without seeing the results that they would like, this bumper sticker is for you."
1,Panasonic PV-V4201 4-Head Mono VCR by Panasonic,"This is the worst VCR I've ever had. Can't program a channel on timer if the channel is higher than 125. Lots of noise, picture quality is poor, remote is very poorly designed. Menu is difficult to understand. Overall a low quality VCR.I'm packing it in the box and returning it tomorrow."
1,DOG - Don't Buy,"We have always loved Panasonic VCRs. We bought 3 4021s in a row and all were bad out of the box. Terrible pictures, waves, columns of colors. I called the 800 number and they said to returned them, bad heads. We bought one several models up and have been disappointed. I think it is time to try another brand!!"
3,works fine!,"I almost cancelled my order after reading all the reviews, glad I didn't. Mine works fine. realized after I got it that I have the same model in my son's room. both work fine. I gave 3 stars because it seems pretty flimsy. Great price!"
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars!,"We have had Panasonic VCRs before and thought they were great. We bought two of this model and both of them have given out in under a year's time. One can't track any more, and the other ejects the tape at random, and whenever you hit rewind. I'm very disappointed."
1,MY last Panasonic VCR,"Ok! I kept buying them because I like the fact that you can record in 3 speeds instead of just 2 like must VCRs now a day. But after this one lasting only 2 month, that's it. It keeps ejecting the movie. My previous one (Panasonic to) is eating the tapes. NO MORE PANASONIC VCRs FOR ME."
4,Adscope Platinum,"I used to own a Littman Select II and I used it until it for a few years. While I love the quality of Littman, the price is just outrageous. Adscope took the quality of Littman, and made it 1/3 of their price. I had used the Adscope version of the Littman Select II and I found no difference in the two stethoscopes other than the brand on the diaphragm. A relative owns the Littman version of the Adscope Platinum Edition stethoscope, and I have come to like the style with the finger placement and mold of the scope."
3,Adscope 615 Platinum Professional Stethoscope,"This is my first stethoscope, I find it very hard to hear the heart, I guess it could be my lack of training"
5,Great Stethoscope for the Practicing Physician,THIS IS A GREAT STETHOSCOPE FOR THE PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. I have practiced internal medicine for nearly 30 years and I have never used a stethoscope that gave me sharper appreciation of the various cardiac murmurs. I especially like that it only has the one diaphragm and there is no problem with manipulating the force of the diaphragm on the chest to pull out those softer S4 sounds. I would recommend this stethoscope to any physician looking for a superior quality stethoscope without having to pay an overpriced Lithman.
1,Better than the sequel,"Overall, both this book and its sequel, ""Still Dead"", were terribly disappointing. Far too often the writers tried to be cute and/or stylish, and they completely missed the point: zombie stories fascinate us not only because they're us, but because we are curious about how we'd respond in a world in which everyone around us not only is indifferent, but downright threatening to our continued existence. Too many times the writers take the point of view of the zombies or depict them fascinated by television or the trappings of middle class or (on and on fill in your own cliched examples).Occasionally the stories rise to something close to what probably most of us are looking for. ""Like Pavlov's Dogs"" or ""Choices"" are the 2 stories most rewarding in terms of survival horror. The rest, sadly, aren't really worth paying attention to."
3,Just a couple that I liked.,"A pretty uneven collection. Liadov and Moussorgsky were somewhat uneven in their output, like most composers. Not everybody can be a Mozart."
4,exelent CD for Zhong-Hu,not much Zhong-Hu concerto out there... but this is 1 of the best i heard. we should encorage more quality Zhong-Hu recording.
4,It is good. I like it,It is good. I like it. But if there are one or twe more spare lamps. It will be perfect.Dorcy 41-1035 Rechargeable Industrial Lantern
3,Old school,"This is an OK flash light, but I like the ""Dorcy 41-4750 180 Lumen High Flux LED Cyber Light Flashlight with Batteries"" way better. I have two of the 41-4750 flashlights and they are much smaller, longer lasting and brighter than the old school 41-1035. I really don't know why you would want this bigger flashlight that doesn't give you as much light? Yea I bought one, but if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have."
3,lasted 3 minutes,"Bought 2 of these lanterns for Christmas. One for my son in law and one for myself. Used mine 3 times and it died, total use time less than 3 minutes. Found it to be a blown bulb. Called Dorcy and they said I had to work it out with Amazon. They are always great to deal with and they gave me a $6 dollar credit to buy a new xenon bulb. Could not find one locally so I installed a kyrpton bulb. So far it is still working fine. When you take it apart to change the bulb beware of how it goes back together. It is not a straight forward process. Could have been damaged in shipping I guess but it came packaged pretty well. Ok light but not the quality of the Craftsman professional that it replaces."
4,Almost perfect,"Almost perfect. Simple design. It's a light that lasts and long time and recharges so you won't have to bankrupt yourself on batteries.You want more than that? Look elsewhere and good luck. You'll waste more time than it's worth.You probably want egg in your beer, too."
1,Don't Be FOOLED!,"I was very dissappointed with this flashlight. It looks exactly like the Sears Craftsman Professional Lantern which I and my family members have several. That is why I purchased it. However, this lantern is not the same. The Craftsman is a true professional lantern with a sealed beam bulb (real glass). Solvents and gasoline will not damage it. It won't scratch or discolor like plastic. It is very bright with a white color to the beam. It also projects very, very far. It's truly the best flashlight I have ever owned.Disappointingly, the Dorcy Lantern has a regular Zenon flashlight bulb with a plastic reflector and lens. The beam is yellow compared to the Craftsman sealed beam, and is not as bright nor does it project as far. Unfortunately, for those of you looking for an excellent flashlight I am sad to say the the Craftsman Lantern is no longer available. I thought the Dorcy was an exact replacement, but I was fooled!"
4,Big light,This flshlight is great.....it has a large beam of light and it is easy to recharge. Can keep an eye on my black dog at night on our walks. It is big but comfortable to hold.
1,Lights out,Not a fan of Dorsey products. Not sure why a simple product is designed and manufactured so poorly. It must be the bright yellow color and the sturdy look in the photo.
1,plasticlens,"When i got this lantern I seen it had a plastic lens, these are for toy flashlights.I replaced it with a sealed beam.I do not buy plastic lens flashlights unless glass lens are available.The xenon bulbs are also dimmer than halogens.I hate plastic lens in a flashlight,garbage."
5,Solid!,Bought this item a few years ago and it's still going strong. I've dropped it on hard tile without consequence and charge it only occasionally. Very good illumination and solidly built.
2,it didn't last long,Everything worked fine for the first 2 weeks. Then the bulb burned out in the middle of the woods at 10pm. I had to use the light on my cellphone to get home safely. Very disappointing.
2,Read the reviews...,"I'm tired of buying rechargeable flashlights that last 6 months. I read the reviews and thought this one may be better. it wasn't. Six months later, the bulb blew, can't find one in stores anywhere. So now yet another flashlight for the trash."
1,It is a plastic nightmare,"I just loved this lantern until the bulb blew out. I purchased the replacement bulb, it fit fine and was the right one. Well I spent three hours, then my husband spent a couple of hours trying to get this to work. We ended up throwing it away. It's a plastic POS. Save your money and your sanity."
5,a light that always is handy,This is a great light to have ready when you need it. It is very dependable and has been used many times. It lasts a long time on a charge. It says industrial but could be used anywhere in the home.
3,Bad purchase,I didn't realize what a nuisance it would be to have to leave it plugged in all the time so it would be ready when needed. We don't use it.
5,tibitz:a land of no lies,"every parent should read this to their child. even as adults we all need a reminder of how important it is to be truthful and good. this is an absolutely amazing book for kids of ALL ages. we are all still learning and growing. thought everyone should know and get a copy. if we lived by the lesson taught in this book wouldn't the world be a much better place!!! thanks,kim"
5,This book has been my favorite gift to give to friends,"I've had the opportunity to share this book with so many people and they all loved the book. Now I have children of my own, it certainly has become one of my favorite books to read to my kids and teach them to be truthful. This is a wonderful book to share with both adults and kids for all ages. I highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful for all ages.,"I thought it was an inspired book, full of creative thoughts and images. Can't wait for the next one!"
5,A wonderful message,I cried when I read this book. I am 28 years old and I keep Tibitz by my nightstand. It reminds me of the goodness still left in the world. I recommend this book to men and women (children too) of all ages.
5,charlotte nc,The first time I heard CD I thought it was ok. Second time it was good and then songs started playing in my mind and then I was hooked. This is by far their best effort. Make sure to read the lyrics to really appreciate this CD.
2,"good playing, ok singing, mediocre tunes",Not too much to add beyond the title of the review. Played this 5-6 times and probably never again. I like what this group is trying to do but to me the songwriting is often cliched and sometimes just so dull that it doesn't sustain my interest. The last times I listened I couldn't wait for it to be over. Perhaps they should consider doing covers of better quality material written by others?
1,Don't waste your money,This album is pretty awful. The vocals are bad and the playing is pretty elementary. Buy some Old Crow Medicine Show instead.
3,bench scraper,"This bench scraper works fairly well. Think I would have liked it better without the hand hole, it would have had a bigger pick up space."
4,Bench Scraper,It is made of plastic and metal and this review requires me to type this many words to define it.
1,A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT,"To repeat what another customer said, ""what a useless toy!"" I've never been so let down by a product in my life. Read the fine print very carefully. It can only scan half a page of continuous text and has almost no storage capabilities. If you are a serious researcher, don't bother."
5,Rock and Roll,The best band I have ever heard of that started in Nashville. They really know how to rock. To bad the band is not together anymore. Would go to their concert anytime.
2,"""Wake Up Screaming by Every Mother's Nightmare"" try their self titled release first",Some decent songs on here but overall it did not do a whole lot for me. I much prefer their self titled release.
1,Not the real thing.,"I was very disappointed with that CD. I thought ''Zorba the Greek'' would be the original version, but it is by far the worst version I have ever listened to. The rest of the CD is also boring. I actually got rid of it very quickly. Sorry, but it's not what I was expecting to hear."
5,One of Angelina's best,"This was a very beautiful film. When I rented it, I had to watch it three times. Now I want to buy it. The music was excellent. The best song was ""I Don't Want To Think About It"" by the Wild Strawberries. I just had to cry in this movie. The ending is sad, but it's also happy in a way. Believe me, this is NOT just another stupid chick flick. Foxfire is emotional and it shows you the true value of friendship. I recommend it to all girls and even guys."
4,Intoxicating performances by Angelina & Hedy,"The talent that exudes out of a young Angelina Jolie is breath-taking. She is so believable as ""Legs"", the street smart, fun-living & loving wanderer. You could feel Hedy's anxiety and emotions as she also gave a truly believable performance as the geiky student photographer looking for a little excitement which is delivered by Angelina Jolie's character ""Legs"". I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! If you are an Angelina Jolie fan & you haven't seen this movie - BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!"
5,Angelina Jolie,This movie works because of Angelina Jolie. Any other actress and it wouldn't even be worth watching. She brings danger and excitement to the film which it desperately needs. The film starts out with a bare butt naked man running through the forest. He barely has much of a part after that so you can guess they didn't hire him for his acting ability. There's some female nudity and some lesbian themes so if you're not into that I'd suggest renting Tomb Raider.
5,Angelina was AMAZING!,One of the best tough-girl flicks I've seen in a long time! Fan of Angelina? Like girl-movies? Do you Root for the Under Dog? Then you will Love this movie as much as I did!!
5,Angelina Rebells for a Cause,"This is a coming of age movie for a small band of young women expelled from high-school for attempting to deal with a perverted biology-teacher all by themselves. That gets everything moving. The scene is set in a small town on the bend in a river with a great old bridge. There is not a lot here to tie the story to a particular geographic area or period in American history. All the guys in town are upset with the girls for causing the biology-teacher, who is also the football coach, all this trouble. That along with other social issues to tangle everything up real good leads to a series of crisis scenarios. The ostracized girls hold a ""bare-breast tattooing by candle-light"" party in ""their"" abandoned house. Then, with messes all around, several people need to be rescued, one at a time, until nearly everything is resolved. Life goes on with everybody, wiser for their shared experiences, wandering off to make their own way in the world."
5,FoxFire,This is the most incredible movie its so totally cool i love any movies with Angelina Jolie but this one was awsome. i really liked her movie girl interupted...but thats another story...well thanks
4,bad ending.....,"i liked this movie from the beginning and i thought it was filled with surprising twists, but the ending was a little weird and kinda' boring. it was like they cut you off. i won't give away the movie but if u like teen movies and angelina jolie, i reccomend it."
2,ISO better actresses!!!,"Can somebody say ""After School Special."" This movie should've had a warning on it that said, ""For girls 13 and under only."" Cause that's age range that might be able to stay focused through this super cheesy movie! The movie tried to be hardcore by talking about sexual harrasment, sex, alcohol, drugs, abuse, and lesbianism. But it was DULL. Angelina Jolie was NOT lively at all throughout any of the movie. She almost put me to sleep. That is, until she took off her shirt, showing her bear chest to everyone. Then 2 more girls followed her lead. So that's what kept me interested! If it weren't for that scene, this movie would've only got one star."
1,"A badly done, soap opera type film","Foxife is a film in which a number of girls get together in order to attack the world as a team. Sounds good right? Unfortunately however, this film is overly dramatic to a point where one might feel physically nauseous. ""Oh no, she's beaing beaten by her father, on no she is on drugs, oh no she is being molested, oh no her father ran out on her etc etc. etc."" Men come off in this flick as being the demons of the world, and it gets boring. The comparison that people make with this film to ""Thelma and Louise"" is just sad. I have now learned that when a film is compared to something, you are better off seeing the film that it is being compared to. ""Thelma and Louise"" had character depth and this does not. ""Thelma and Louise"" was inspiring, and this is just simply tiring. This film has been done. If you like tacky, ""girly"", overly-dramatic, bad visuals, and terrible scripts definitely check this film out. Otherwise put it aside."
2,.....,"i thought jolie played a dull character, but a character with mystery. she should have had more lines, and she shouldn't have left in the end. not one of her best movies."
2,"Short but good nude scene, disappointing movie","Well if you want to see Angelina Jolie young and naked in a short one time scene this is the movie to buy, if you don't then leave the movie alone it's just another teen rebelion movie."
5,whew,"oh my gosh. i absolutely love this movie and i fell in love with both maddie and legs. hat's off to both hedy buress and angelina jolie. their performance was absolutely incredible. while some have deemed this a 'lesbian' film it is definitely not. of course there is some nudity but the most sexual scene occurs with all of the clothes on. .... this is the most poignant and sexually tense scene in the whole movie. on the whole it was a good movie with some odd lines thrown in. especially the 'do you girls run with foxes'. that was so random and so forced. some of the acting could have been done without but buress and jolie saved it. my only regret was that maddie didn't leave with legs. don't try comparing this movie to the book, they are very different and equally good. the casting couldn't have been better for the two female leads. my recommendations to anyone who wants an excellent movie to watch."
4,angelina jolie,"Angelina Jolie was great in this role. She was like a female James Dean. Ruthless and intoxicating. All the women fall under her spell and go with whatever she says. She shows them to stand up for themselves and rule their own lives. Legs unfortunetly shows how to rule life in the baddest of ways: Stealing cars, Breaking and entering, and hitch hiking. Soon the girls pay for the choices they made with Legs. Good Movie. Too bad all the girls don't have the superb acting experiance like Angelina Jolie."
5,loved it!!,this movie is great is you`ve seen read the book both are great every girl should see it and read the book
5,This is a great movie,I came upon this movie one night and ever since it has been one of my favorites. It is a great movie that really looks at the hardships of teenage girls and shows them that you have to stand up for yourself sometimes. I also think that the cast did a great job at bringing the characters to life.
5,One of my favorite movies of all time...,"Foxfire, starring Angelina Jolie and Hedy Buress, is quite possibly the best female bonding movie I've ever seen. The way five very different girls come together to form such a close group seems very unlikely, but is actually very true to life. If you are in need of a movie to show you what true friendship is for, this is definitely one you won't want to miss. I give it five stars plus."
1,Embarassing...,"I know a lot of girls that like this movie. It's been a big hit amongst the gay women in the US. Unfortunately, for the straight girls and guys, we have to put up with Jenny Shimizu's awful acting (possible the worst I have ever seen) and cliched and cheesey dialogue that had me on the floor cringing. In fact, Angelina's performance is the only one worth seeing. Although due to everyone else's non-existant acting, she seems slightly hammy and OTT. Still, she is mesmerising..."
1,Beware!,"I regret buying this product because this Basic Hebrew by Pimsleur is just a replica of the Conversational Hebrew by Pimsleur. I bought the two products, this Basic Hebrew and the Conversational Hebrew--because I wanted to learn more- and the packaging was different-only to find out that this Basic Hebrew was just a copy of the Conversational Hebrew---the two are the same but packaged differently--Again, they just the same! The Conversational Hebrew just has two extra CDS. I feel ripped off by Amazon--they advertised both-- and I had the impression that one would get more from both. No! They both have the same content! Please buy the Conversational Hebrew by Pimseleur instead b/c it has two extra CDs."
4,Easy learning of basic Hebrew,"This is fun, I find myself wanting to do more lessons per day than it's supposed to. I look forward to getting to the next level.However, there is a major drawback - it's clearly aimed at american men trying to hit on israeli women, which for me - a non-american woman - is not that amusing. But it's worth it."
1,Learning through repetition:,". I have tried to learn Spanish, Arabic, and Hebrew with Pimsleur and must say: ""I did not have the success I expected."". Psychologists tell us the more senses that we use in learning, the better it is absorbed, retained, and recalled. Perhaps I am a visual person and need book work, writing, as well as repetition and listening.. I must warn that sometimes when you buy this product, they automatically bill you month after month. Be certain to read your purchase agreement and cancel your next order, then order another when needed at your convenience to avoid the repetitive ordering scam.."
4,Basic but very good,"I got this to have a head start on learning Hebrew, my comute to work is exactly the same length of time of each lesson. It is very interesting the method and you must follow the instruction, I was very determined on doing that.I have learned most of it, and I will repeat it. However I think I need to read as well, some of the words would make more sense if I could read to make sure I am saying correctly.But for basic and practicality of the method, it is great, highly recommend."
4,Nice Product to Learn Conversational Hebrew,"This product uses a non-flashcard approach, unlike many of its competitors, to teach conversational Hebrew and some vocabulary. It offers great value and I would purchase it again."
5,An Emotionally-Resonant Masterpiece,"MISFITS is an emotionally-resonant masterpiece in which Ray Davies admits that the Kinks will always be outside the mainstream, but, after Elvis's death, wonders whether that's really such a bad thing. The title track, ""A Rock & Roll Fantasy"", and ""Get Up"" are the centerpieces of that album. The first two songs I mentioned express how I felt when I gave promises to young women I was close to not to get ""caught up"" in musical trends when making dance-music choices, as well as inspiring me to look at photographs of attractive female celebrities to help me ward off the temptation to go to every food-related function I hear about (e.g. my old school's Thanksgiving Dinner). The last song, ""Get Up"" says that adults can age and still love rock & roll, which is reflected in my enjoyment of older alternative bands like INXS, U2, REM, and the Police. Anyone who's reaching or just past thirty should own this one."
2,uh well sounds okay,it sounds like a nice book besides the japanese. but i guess its okay if ya need something to look at.
3,over my head,"i'm sure that highly educated literature scholars get a lot out of this book, but I think that it is over my head as I rarely feel that I know what he's saying.i am not educated in literature, and I realize that."
1,It Lasted a Little While,"I have 2 pickups that needed a bed liner at the same time. I put Herculiner in one and PlastiKote in the other. After 5 years the PlastiKote is still holding up well. The Herculiner only lasted a couple years until it started fading and disintegrating. I went to Herculiner's website to inquire about the warranty. Their faq basically says that if it doesn't turn out right, it must be your fault. Well, the prep for the PlastiKote was basically the same and it has lasted, the Herculiner did not."
5,Fantastic product,"Checked many types of liner kits on the market but this one is more durable, reliable and easy to use."
2,But wait a year or so,"I have read the previous posting and agree with virtually all that was written about quality of material, installation ease and cautions, looks.I am 1 1/2 years since I installed and now the product is starting to peel off. The warrenty talks about quality of the product and stops when it goes to application ""due to many variables."" My truck is used weekly on a farm hauling all types of material and just not sure that the toughness holds up. The common problem areas for my application is the bed where most of the wear and tear comes. I have written the company for assistance and will post my follow."
1,"Deserves a ZERO - because of the ""hero"".","I can't believe this is considered a romance. The ""hero"" deliberately destroys an innocent woman's reputation for his own selfish purposes; never feeling an ounce of regret or remorse.He has the NERVE later to be angry at the heroine for (trying) to turn the tables on him. Of course, she fails. Because no heroine can ever get justice from a hero, no matter how horrible their behavior is."
2,Boring Romance Book,"This book was dull. It wasn't the worst, but the characters were totally unbelievable and barely likable. The irascible grandfather was the only redeeming thing about the book--he was awesome. The main character gets depressed and magically loses 75 pounds? Without exercising? And doesn't gain any of it back when she's no longer depressed? On what planet?I don't want to read about flawlessly beautiful people and magical weight loss. Boring, boring, boring."
2,"Brittle sound, orchestra of limited range, handcuffed or underpowered","Easily on the face, the physical tonality of Janacek goes far without much complaining about limited range. His compositions are amply wide for any string orchestra, and certainly diverse enough in their conception. So within the first 10 minutes of this cd you'll find yourself more engrossed with the sound engineering and with what Pople is trying to do with Janacek.. rather than enjoying Janacek. Soon enough the realization solidifies that any capable string quartet could give this recording quite a bit of challenge. Where's the contrabass? Did they pick up a paycheck for just showing up and occasionally pulsing along with the orchestra? To verify this assumption all you need to do is listen to Track 12, the beginning of the Suite for String Orchestra. Their bowing is embarrassing, as if the policemen who reply to your urgent 911 call come dressed in lilac unitards and only armed with nerf wifflerbats.Bang the gong and move on."
2,Not Like the Original,"I have a small bottle of vintage Shocking by Schiaparelli that I love. Shocking had been discontinued for decades but was reintroduced sometime in the past 10-20 years. I purchased a large bottle of the modern incarnation and was extremely disappointed. The original perfume is a sophisticated blend of white flowers, cyphres, and aldehydes. It was probably made with real musk or animal ingredients, as was many other perfumes in the 30s, 40s and 50s. The new formula probably uses synthetic musks, and it just doesn't have the same appeal. The new formula screamed floral, without being tempered by the amber/aldehyde notes of the original. It was harsh and cloying. I'll have to continue to find vintage bottles of Shocking rather than buy the new version."
1,Ugghhh...,"There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music. Paul Simon, say, or Bob Dylan. Kate Bush, though she started a little later. All of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great.Joni Mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead. Maybe I don't rate as a JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that album hundreds of times times over the years.I wanted to find out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism. The lyrics are old and tired, and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale, too. The only good lyrics on this album were provided by Yates.At least her paintings are good."
1,"Be ashamed of yourself, Scorpio!","Oh, Joni! This is BAD. Sounds like stuff you'd hear in a grocery store. Where did they get this stuff from-and isn't she embarassed to have it released?! And hejiraboy-you DID mention that Joni Mitchell is a FEMALE artist..."
4,Michael Logan is genius too!,"Well maybe that's over the top and the four stars aren't for Beginning of Survival (tho it's close)...they are for reviewer Michael Logan.I was looking to see if the art work for SHINE was up anywhere and happened on Michael Logan's brilliant record by record reviews of Joni Mitchell's work. For anyone who has followed the music of this great artist songwriter musician , I recommend you follow his name to his other Mitchell reviews here. They are so well written and so insightful, and without any hint of fanzine vibe they should be required reading for anyone who either appreciates Mitchell's craft or who thinks she got off track with Hissing of Summer Lawns. Thank YOU Michael Logan who ever you are!And Joni never stop your music."
3,Joni compilation albums and Geffen Records,"As I recall, Joni had major legal battles with David Geffen and Geffen records in the 1990s. This CD and the other compilation album of her Geffen years are probably a result of her financial settlement with Geffen. Joni has never seemed one to want to do compilation albums. She resisted doing a greatest hits compilation for years until she finally agreed to release Hits and Misses in 1996. Anyway, food for thought."
2,good product,the bottle is perfect size and sprays good with no drip. I use it for dog training with alittle bit of vanilla for them to use their nose first and it's perfect for that. The seller on the other hand didn't follow protocall IMO. They over charged for shipping making this item not a great buy. then I cancelled the order and they still shipped the item the next day. 5 stars for the bottle 1 star for the seller.
5,one truth prevails,"Case Closed is one the most well rounded, engaging and throughly enjoyable anime series out there. It is a joy to watch and i always love how things are explained and how Jimmy (Conan) catches the bad guy (girl). Of course with the help of dim-witted Detective Richard Moore who spends as much time drinking and chasing after his favorite pop idol. But somehow they make it work and of course there's the whole Rachel and Jimmy thing. She hasn't figured out that Conan is really Jimmy Kudo in a pint sized body. It makes for a hilarity that is rarely matched by others out there. If you are looking for an anime series that you can get into and get your money's worth. Well Case Closed is it believe me, you'll be hooked after one or two episodes."
5,Exciting Excellence,"It's always great to see a good Conan (Jimmy) mystery solved. I now have all my [adult swim] episodes completed in DVD format. Woo-Hoo! Now on to Season 4, where we will be entering new unseen mysteries. The suspense is kill me; I can't wait to see what's in store for us. The whole family loves this Anime."
3,NIce features and lens but poor picture quality,Had high expectations with Leica lens but picture quality is below average. Tried developing photos at Costco and Ofoto and it was the camera and not development service. It's fragile and sand got caught very easily. Dissapointing... Avoid. I can now see why the retailers are liqudating this camera.
1,complicated,"I bought this camera 1 week ago, I am still trying to figure out how to use it. The viewing menu is so small I can hardly read it, even with glasses on. I had three people trying to help me figure it out and couldn't do it. I am in the process of trying to understand the manual, that is very hard to do, it is no easy to read. I bought this camera because it was supposed to be a simple point and shoot, not so, there are more instructions to read and understand than anything I have ever bought. I tried to return it but couldn't because I opened the package, how else would I know its complicated and impossible to use? so I am stuck with this thing and I have not been able to take one picture. If you want a simple camera, forget this one. Stick to a company that just makes cameras."
3,Excellent beginner superzoom camera,"I want to just let you know that I am definetely not a pro, but an average person, so that is how I'm writing my review. I got this camera 2 years ago because I wanted a superzoom. Well, with the picture stabilization and the 12X zoom, I got what I wanted, but not much more. If you want to take nature photos, this camera is terrific. If you want to move on to scenery that moves, your going to have to find something else, b/c this camera does not have the shutter speed for it. Also, low light or artificial light does not come out very well either. With flash will look so-so as long as your image is within range, but the background is black. I do love this camera for being easy to use, but I've personally grown out of it. The 2 MP is also outdated."
3,Extra Cheese on Your Popcorn,"This is a strange little flick in the way that a lot of the movie is just a long running add for another cheesy movie Hard Rock Zombies, for much of the film I felt like I was watching an infomercial for another film. The whole film takes place at a drive in, there is a story line, or vignettes rather switching back and forth between cars for reactions, sexual hyjinx, and general mischief, as well as a gang that hangs out at the drive in, looking for and causing trouble, but over all unless you are really into super cheese 80's or really love the movie Hard Rock Zombies this film really wont appeal to most people. I love films in this era and genera but this is really watered down and slapped together. If you are a fan of movies that take place at the Drive in I would recommend checking out Dead End Drive-In (1986) I watched it the other day, right good flick."
3,A bit flimsy for something made in the USA,"I bought this kit, thinking that the quality would be a little better than stuff made in the far east. It's the same."
4,get it for real cheap ONE PENNY!!!,"Can't remember where I got into this but it was and is still good to listen. What I like about them? the hyptonizing beats, their cold and dark lyrics, their thick accent in a foreign language most of the time and those grinding electric chords.Listen ""I sweep but don't clean"" and you'll understand what I mean."
3,The Wild Child,"The rating I gave is because I really cannot remember the movie. Thus I gave it an ""It""s okay"" review."
5,lait et eau,Done in a docu-feature style by a man with child's soul. The untamed warmness of Victor perfectly counterbalance the civilized coldness of Itard. Truffaut does not try to justify anything. One of his best.
5,The T R U T H can never be hidden!,"This book is a documentary for all generations to come about the TRUTH about Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel.The history remains no matter how hard enemies try to forge it, and this book is to register the names, sites & population of the holy lands!"
2,"Usable, but sketchy and biased","This book, like many books on this subject which approach the issue with an agenda, is not particularly useful for the average reader. While there are a lot of facts, most are taken out of context and inserted into a political scheme. The research seems decent but there are a lot of weak points. All in all, I found that this book was somewhat useful for doing scholarly research but I would strongly urge casual readers or readers of 'first impression' to steer clear of such obvious propaganda."
2,How can one rate this book?,"War is war. Anytime two groups of people fight over the same place, one wins and one looses - both suffer. Had the Arab forces won in 1948, the Jews would have had a book called ""All that remains..."". HOWEVER, this is not to say that those who suffered should be written off, and reality and history are facts. So a book like this is important for the process of reconcilliation between both Israeli's and Palestinians. How can it be rated? Well, it is essential for anyone wanting to understand the conflict to read books like this, however biased they may be. But, because of this bias, as with any Israeli or Arab history book that is slanted to extremes, it can't be rated too highly. Read it to understand, not to form opinions."
2,Well they look good.,I bought this book a while ago and thought it was wonderful - beautiful pieces! But then I actually tried to build one. MANY of the measurements were just plain wrong - to the point that the shelves wouldnt have been wide enough to reach the sides and the molding wasn't long enough to fit the sides and front. This may explain why they took it off the market so quickly - but disappointing nonetheless. Don't buy a copy unless you plan to redo the plans yourself!
5,Good For Over Twenty Years,"My wife and I got this pattern when we got married over 20 years ago. It still looks good. I decided I needed this serving set to go with the one we already have. Getting them out of the dishwasher, I can't tell the new ones from the ones that are over 20 years old."
1,"Really terrible, misguided project","What an awful record. While I appreciate Cray's homage to Hi and Stax/Volt artists, he just doesn't have the chops to pull it off. His voice just don't make it compared to Syl Johnson, let alone Al Green or any of the Stax guys. And his guitar, always underpowered in my opinion, is just lame here. Really bad record."
4,Aural Pleasure,"On his Rykodisc debut, Robert Cray mixes two parts soul with one part blues--a winning formula. Echoes of great labels Stax, Hi, even early Motown abound on the album. The half-dozen originals written by Cray are especially impressive, and ""All the Way"" sounds like an instant classic."
1,a disappointing turn of events,"It seems R. Cray continues to evolve from the blues style that won him his success in the first place. If you want to hear from top notch Robert Cray, check out one of his first three albums (or anything with his original band). If you want to hear Robert Cray doing Otis Redding, this may be the place to start. It's disappointing to see this great talent being wasted. Time to get the old band together."
4,Back to the beginning of Robert Cray,"This takes you back to Robert Cray's beginnings - soul, blues and it rocks - there are a few slow soul ballads - and one of those prohibits a 5 star rating in my book - it makes you want to stand up and dance!"
2,put your shoes back on robert,It's too bad Robert was affected so much by negative reviews of his midnight sroll and don't be afraid of the dark releases. These we're truly excellent works. Take your shoes off is apparently roberts' over reaction to mostly deaf critics. Robert- get back to what you do best! Put your shoes on and let's stroll awhile.
4,1-4-3 Young Bob!!!,"I really enjoyed this CD ~ I took my shoes off, propped up my feet and let myself drown in Young Bob's sweet and soulful voice .... ahhhh, what pleasure! I had to have it because I love Robert Cray, but even if you're not a big fan, you can't help but appreciate these tracks .... gotta love ""What About Me""! This is a big coup for Rykodisc!"
5,Still the best mix of soul & blues,"I have long said that Robert Cray is amongst the best in terms of mixing soul and blues - right up there with the likes of Otis Redding and Curtis Mayfield. This album definitely exemplifies that notion. What a superb mix of fun-loving, get-you-rockin' songs like ""There's Nothin' Wrong,"" ""What About Me,"" and ""Pardon,"" plus soul masterpieces such as ""That Wasn't Me,"" ""It's All Gone,"" and, my favorite cut on the album, ""All the Way."" The album also contains straight blues like ""Love Gone To Waste,"" and ""Tollin' Bells."" Robert Cray and his band started something special with 1997's album ""Sweet Potatoe Pie."" They finished it with style and a touch of genius with ""Take Your Shoes Off."" - 5 stars."
1,Take Your Shoes Off...So I Can Blame This Smell On Yer Feet!,"What happened here? Young Bob retire on us? ... And tell me this, do I detect some of the same studio dampness that was apparent way back on False Accusations? Is the idea that RC sold the rights to a bunch of second rate out-takes from previous efforts over his entire career to Ryko and they made an official release out of it really that far from obvious? One thing's for sure, I aint going any further than my living room to see an RC show if this is the board of faire. And if you think this is a turn in the wrong direction, just wait til you hear ""Shoulda Been Home"" Hoooboy!A stinker here, no doubt. Go for ""I Was Warned"" or ""A Shame & A Sin"" if you don't have 'em. These two are less commercial and all the better for it. Sorry RC; still love the old stuff!"
1,The .... is that,It was good at putting me to sleep at night. but I still have fear of driving despite doing all the exercises.
5,"Every word is savored, so simple and so close to the heart. The most honest and straight forward writing I have ever read","I highly reccomend this book, I have become a fan of Toni Packer and this book is her finest yet. It is a no frills book that you can pick up and open to any chapter for honest direct inquiry into the heart of silence. She amazes me with her candor and her fresh look at the human condition. I have reread chapters again and again, and each time I hear something new. This is what she is pointing to, pure listening and being in this moment completely."
4,Best Used Before Naming Your Baybee!,"One of the oafish ladies in my wife's Big Readers Book Club recently had twins (one boy, one girl) and she could've really used this book before naming the screaming mutants ""Cooleena"" and ""Rupappy"". I suppose that's better than what her equally idiotic husband named their blue heeler (""Muttplug""). Lansky's book really could help a lot of people. Provided they receive it in time..."
1,3rd party confirmation,"Sorry, but how can you use the word 'best' in your title. is there a third party confirmation overseeing the publishing of this books?"
3,"Good book, but dated",I guess I didn't notice when this book was published. The names in it seemed to be really old-fashioned.
1,Lousy-nothing you can't find in a basic internet search,"I bought this when I took advantage of Amazon's Super Saver Shipping. Thank goodness it was cheap, but it still wasn't worth it's cheap price! There is absolutely nothing original or insightful about it. Using a basic baby name search on the internet, you can come up with more than was offered in this book, and for FREE! I wouldn't waste your time with this one..."
2,Is this all?,"I was surprised to find out how few names the book included. I don't consider ""Gabriel"", ""Gabrielle"" and ""Gabriella"" to be three different suggestions. I bought this book based on the reviews, but was surprised to see that I didn't agree with the majority. The alphabetical section is not user friendly in listing the names. I think I'll need to buy another book or go online for other resources."
2,Blecchh!,"This book makes the mistake of interpreting rather than defining some of the names. For example, Aidan means ""fire,"" NOT ""warmth of the home."" Spellings are capricious as well; the most common and traditional spelling of Rhiannon is omitted in favor of several modern misspellings. No guidance is given as to pronunciation, but this is a failing of most name books. If you want to know the meaning of the name you choose for your child, keep browsing--this is not the book for you."
4,It is a pretty good book!,"I think this is a book worth checking into. I know it was published in 1984, but it still has many nice names, as well as origins, meanings, and variations. I say if you're having a baby, you should definitely check this one out!"
1,User hostile program!,"I began using 3D Home Architect years ago and found I could do most anything I wanted with version 4 deluxe. Then I tried this POS, which is as user-hostile as any program I've ever encountered. Not intuitive, takes ages to set up defaults to make it do what you want it to do, pitiful documentation and tech support, not able to import plans from previous versions (even using the industry standard DFX files - but the did warn me). Version 4 and earlier were written by Chief Architect; later versions by Punch Software. Go try something by CA, like Better Homes & Gardens Home Designer. The only reason I gave this product 1 star is because there is no lower rating!"
3,Just fine for $13.50,"Got it today. It is a little clunky, and you have to be patient when using ""duplicate"", etc, but I have the first floor about done, and it works okay. Has stopped once but no big deal, just leave auto-save on. Have not used stuff like this before. It will really help my wife picture things. It isn't real intuitive, but it suffices. The help menu and index is sparse. The views are okay, but the rotation in 3D is slow on this 1.X gigahertz 500MB ram 64MB video card machine. Good night. I hope to have my house plans done within a week.Update after several weeks: still same opinion. Works, decent graphics, and my wife did appreciate the opportunity to view what things 'might' look like, so the rendering was acceptable. I would recommend to someone who is just wanting to visualize a home, and maybe play a little with sizing up rooms, re-locating doors and windows, etc."
1,Completely Useless for Nonprofessional Decorator,"I bought this to try to do some easy interior decorating and layouts--basically to see how to best put my furniture in a new apartment and figure out what color to paint the walls etc. But the software is NOT intuitive at all; you really have to spend a lot of time learning how to use it before you can do any little thing. Then I thought there would be a sample of a living room that I could just open and edit, but no--there are only sample interiors for a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Also, the paint samples are quite limited, and I could not figure out how to customize the colors. To top it off, all the styles offered (things like furniture fabrics) are like Goodwill rejects: ugly green plaids, for example. Anyway, this program definitely seems geared more toward pros who are building houses from scratch than amateurs who just want an easy decorating tool."
1,Absolutely awful,In a word. CRASH!!The only thing good was Amazon gave me a full refund.Dont waste your time on it.
1,I Hate this Software,"I wrote a review under the 'Special Edition' of 3D HA. I bought this when it was $60. I hated it. It wasn't nearly as usable as earlier versions, and through all the years it has been out, has declined in functionality, rather than improved. I still can't create a simple roof in my design with this product. Doesn't do any landscaping (like different level entries).I would not buy this software."
1,3D Home Architect Home Design Deluxe 6,Very basic program. Would purchase again if price was $20.00 or less just for the basic house layout.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money, this program is very limited and for beginers hard to navigate. I gave up on it, it's in the trash, broke out the old drawing board and have my new house half completed. Thanks for nothing Broderbund."
5,Broderbund 3D Home Architect Home Design Deluxe 6,This product did just as it said it would be. And now days that hard to fine.
1,much worse than version 3,"I was an avid v3 user. I loved v3 because I could get going so quickly. All you had to do was create a rough outline of a floorplan, and then it was easy to slide walls around to match proper dimensions. Rooms were automatically created with via contiguous walls.Version 6 is FAR behind this. I've been trying to create a simple floorplan that I got into v3 in about 30 minutes. I've been trying for hours now, and the most simple tasks are impossible. The default snap puts dimensions at 1/4"" snaps. I'm trying to make a 12' wall, for example. Sliding my mouse pointer, I can choose 11' 11 3/4"", and the next stop available is 12' 0 3/4"". This sort of behavior is very common. Next, I'd like to define the height of walls in a room. Rooms are not defined, however. I can install a ""ceiling"" object.The bottom line is that this software has put me way behind, and it just isn't worth trying to use. All of the intuitiveness of 3.0 is gone."
2,Extremely slow rendering and a reminder of....,a software program called Floorplan. I like version 4.0 a heck of alot better. Im glad I only tried the trial version. Im very disappointed with 6.0. the rendering takes forever and the graphics are'nt as good as version 4.0 or as good as Punch architectural series 18. Don't waste your money on the version.
1,Unacceptable vendor attitude,"I bought this thing the other day (through another retailer). Like others, I was expecting it to be an update to previous versions. Like others, I was surprised to find that it was a completely new program, and wouldn't even import files created by older versions of 3D Home Architect... of which I have several.Even if you don't have any old files to import, ask yourself whether you want to deal with a company that takes this attitude toward its customers. It takes a pretty obnoxious marketing drone to put the name of an established program on an entirely different one, and leave existing customers with no upgrade path. If they'll do it to us, they'll do it to you..."
2,Would recommend Punch! Architectural Series (AS18) instead,"I would not have bought this product if it wasn't necessary to share house layout/design plans with my electrician's office.Our PC is Windows 2000 Pro.Why do I not like it?- It's hard to put a half-wall up (I had to elevate it from the floor below)- Most importantly it crashes frequently. If I have a 2 or more models open, and then I re-open the model that you're not viewing currently, it crashes. Now, I ""wised"" up a little and go to the ""Window"" menu to see if I have the model opened yet before trying to open it up again. This wasn't the only time it would crash, although the only sequence of events that I could reproduce the program crash with.We already had the Punch! Architectural Series. And I have never, ever had the program crash or found it difficult to layout items as necessary. It also has many more options for walls/doors/furniture/landscaping/etc."
3,Powerful But Buggy,"The most powerful of the consumer level design applications. Lots and lots of capability, but the bugs will drive you crazy. Walls disappear, cabinets stretch to infinity, the roof building feature will make you cut your wrists. Views add levels to themselves unbidden. Lots of hard reboots. They should have left in the capabilities and fixed the bugs, instead of dumbing down subsequent versions."
1,Doesn't handle complexity,"Easy to use with a reasonable user interface. For a one story home with four walls it's probably fine. But modeling my small, 100 year old midwest farm house was FAR beyond it's capabilities. After adding the second floor I started to ad an addition - crash. After applying all the suggestions from their on-line help the results were - crash. I move from my midsize laptop to my gonzo tower PC. The results? Crash. I recreated the floor plan - crash.Completely worthless for a complex design.I bought the CD used so I didn't pay much but it still wasn't worth it."
1,Difficult to use,If your house is on a perfectly level plot this may be useful. However I found it extremely disappointing. It doesn't complete exterior walls on the dormer section. I simply wasted my money on this software.
2,Not good for a custom designs.,"I bought this yesterday and it is going back today. It claims you can create contractor-ready plans. It does not say that it only supports angled roofs at a fixed 20 & 40 degree pitch. That being said, I was probably expecting too much for a $70 CAD software package."
3,Small photos,"The photos are small and not the best. It would be nice to have photos of the plants in different stages of growth, like when flowering and when in the fruit.Some plants I found I could not id with this book."
4,Excellent resource,"I saw this in someone else's home and came home and ordered it. It is a great book with beautiful photos and great descriptions. My only complaint is that I would like to see it be a bit more comprehensive. On my property alone I have so far noticed over 35 varieties of wildflowers and quite a few of them are not listed in the book. However, it did help me identify several of them, and of the books I looked through, this one seemed to be the best!"
3,A wish for better photos,"I just like to identify wildflowers, guess I'm a very amateur botanist. I find the information quite good in this book however, I take much better photos than what's in here. I wish they would contact me for photos!!! No I'm not selling them. I have had this book since 2002 and it has been with me from southern New Mexico to Fairbanks, Alaska. It is a sturdy book and has held up well."
5,Must have for people who love the Rocky Mountains,I just moved to this area from the desert and have no idea what grows in the Rocky Mountains. This book gives so much information on plants for the various elevations. Great examples of plant parts to help with identification. I can't wait to get started in the spring with my new landscaping with all the native plants in my new area.
2,"Informative, but crappy photographs","This book contains a lot of information. It's not as intuitive as some other flora/fauna guide books that I've read. Although it does contain more information than most. I wish it was more specific to different parts of the rockies, and had better photographs."
5,Lovin' the Latin,"I give it a 75, I can dance to it. (For the young folk, that is a reference to the rating that ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" got on American Bandstand.)The cuts on the album have a great Latin rhythm, crystal clear guitar work, and nice vocals. The cuts are generally upbeat, without being saccharin or bubble-gum. The CD has a good mix of vocal and instrumental cuts.The synthesizer on some of the cuts is a bit over-played, but it generally provides good accompanyment to the guitar."
3,blood bath,good collection films that not published and unknown modern horror...high quality of second degree films..who like thrillers and ugly and gore horror it's good for the general horror shelf
1,Not for Horror Fans,"If you want to spend an evening with friends making fun of movies and actors, this is for you. If you are a serious horror fan---skip this!!! Ugh, the movies are TERRIBLE!!!"
2,not so scary horor,This set was not so scary some of the movies was boreing .Allthough it was shipped to me neatly and on time with good custmer servise. The movies wasn't as good as I exspected .not scary at all I watch all the movies and resold it but would buy another movie from this company and recomind to friends ....
5,Great Service,These folks were so good to work with. i made a mistake ordering and they called me to find out what I needed. the product has a great feel and looks great.
4,"This is how you'd make a good Hip-Hop, R&B and Reggae album","Princess Erika definitely has shown that it is possible to put out a quality CD covering Hip-Hop/R&B/Reggae. Definitely in the class of Lauren Hill. Songs that stand out are Nouvelle Generation, Stop, Sister, Ego and Dans Une Station (ou na na na faut que Je le dise). Yeah, it's in French which means that you might miss out on some groovy lyrics but hey the beats are slamming and the flow is like the Nile. Smooth"
1,Book defective but seller quickly resolved issue,"When I received the book, I found the glue (it was a hardbound book) to be all dried out. Consequently almost every page I turned came out in my hand. The book is all in pieces and rubber banded together, until I can get the time to go to Kinkos and have it bound. I e-mailed the seller regarding this problem, who quickly got back to me. There were no more copies of the book in his inventory, so he could not replace it, but he immediately refunded my money for the purchase price as well as the shipping, and said I could keep the book. So, while the book was defective, and will require some doctoring, I believe it to have been an honest mistake on the seller's part, and it was addressed promptly and courteously to my full satisfaction."
5,Linda Davis CD,I have been a Linda Davis fan for a long time and this CD was one of her better works.
5,Superb artist,This is some of the most soulful piano music I have ever heard. I love her selections and her style.
3,not the best,"not the best but it is informative. took a little longer to get the dvd but still very polite company, just not real fond of the actual dvd."
4,"Versatile follow-up, again with excellent live disc","Was their superb debut already a exciting mix of musical styles, this album is maybe even more eclectic. In general it is a bit more rock-guitar oriented than Mental Floss... but it still tries to combine all musical styles in one song. Unfortunately, it does not work for all songs (Duck Ska or Mr. Ezway), but they are overshadowed by gems like Routine (reason enough to buy this album), Comeback and Harvey Quinnt.Again, this reissue features a live disc. This time it is a 1992 concert from Tokyo. Live, it seems as if they explode on stage as they are energetic to the maximum. With more guitars than in the studio, it makes you scream and jump around.The reason this album deserves 4 stars is that it is a little bit less overwhelming than their debut. I wanted to give them 4,5 stars but that is unfortunately not possible. They are still better than most other bands as many will give their right arm for an album like this one."
3,Okay!,"Most of the reviewers were probably fans when this came out, I'd just like to note that you can find this enjoyable to some extent even if you weren't paying attention in the early 90s.Also, other reviewers have compared this group to Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. While I can see where this comes from, this group is actually much, much closer in style to 2 Skinnee J's, and even more so the Marginal Prophets."
4,Annointed Album,"If you are looking to have your own worship service in your bedroom, buy this album. This is one of the most annointed albums in the gospel music industry. The song ""Because Of These Things"" ministers on a personal level. If you cant understand why you gave God your heart, listen to this song. Then think about all that He has done for you, and you'll find the answer. Trust me, there is ministry in the song, and the cd."
5,Very chic,I use these glasses for mixed drinks when company comes over. A mojito and gin and tonic look great in these chic glasses. They remind me of the glasses they use in the bars and clubs in NYC. You can't beat the price either!
5,my kid love them,"We originally bought these glasses years ago from the Bon Marche, who quit carrying them. I was delighted to find them online! My daughters (4yrs and 8 yrs) love using the ""fancy"" glasses. I have found them to be quite durable for how delicate they look."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Except for 'Laura Non C'e' the songs are not good,not good for dancing or listening to. His voice is bland, and the melodies forgetful. Go somewhere else, like 883, or Ramazzotti, for good Italian pop."
5,Love this book!,"I work as a pastry chef, and sometimes in Garde Manger station, this book falls into both categories, great flavor combinations and beautiful presentations. Worth the money, and worth the time. The recipes seem to work, sometimes with slight adjustment, but for the most part it's spot on. Enjoy!"
4,"A unique cookbook full of inspiring ideas, but ultimately it's just a novelty","A great book filled with great recipes that can be used to make an amuse-bouche, appetizers, or even a main course. This book is not for beginners, however, and many of the techniques and ingredients are going to be outside the reach of beginning chefs. Furthermore, creating an amuse is really not appropriate for most people who are going to be entertaining. They're really for restaurants. A good amuse gives you a sample of what's coming or a window into the chef's mind, but at a dinner party they might seem like fussy appetizers that are too small and will leave your guests wanting more. Great recipes, but to put this book to good use, make appetizers and entrees."
3,I wish,"Wow what an awesome book. While living in NYC and Miami, I didn't have a hard time finding interesting ingredients like razor clams, squab and foie gras, but living in an area with limited grocery stores I feel abandoned. If I thought that Foley Fish would ship me 4 Kumamoto oysters without killing me on shipping and handling I would do it. Or if Chef Tramonto would kindly give me a substitution I would be pleased. The lay out of the book is great and the presentations are inspiring. I guess on my next trip to a great metropolis I will pack ziploc bags and dry ice instead of shoes and makeup."
4,"Interesting, but lacks intensity","I recieved this book as a gift, and so far have made the ""Champagne Saffron Sorbet"" which was expensive to make- it required a whole bottle of champagne for 1 quart of sorbet, but nonetheless it was the best sorbet I have ever had in my life. I also tried the ""charred lamb with oven dried tomatoes"" and the ""fig with prosciutto and marscarpone foam"". I found the amuse juice section unique- the ""pomegranate juice with clove"" is painstaking but rewarding (juicing 7 pomegranates) and the ""carrot juice with ginger syrup"" was refreshing.The photography is beautiful, but the book requires some special equipment: a juicer, a terrine mold, an ice cream machine, and a foam charger. If you are a serious chef, as I am, you will enjoy this book immensely, although it is very focused, and is not going to produce a meal!"
5,SHR Rocks,I love to use School House Rock in my classroom. The songs are catchy and the students remember them. I bought this one so my students could memorize the Preamble easily. It worked!
5,All he wants is a relaxing vacation and a lobster dinner!,"John Candy at his best! A story that anyone can relate to. While trying to give his family a fun, relaxing summer vacation in Florida, Candy has no end of troubles. From a wicked sunburn to a run-down beach house, this stressed out air traffic controller can't catch a break. This movie has a great cast, including the scene-stealing Rip Torn as the crusty old ""pirate"" Scully. If you call yourself a John Candy fan and have never seen this film...SHAME ON YOU!!!"
3,Candy Fans will enjoy this.,"For fans of John Candy's earlier films, Summer Rental is a must see. Not as mature as Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Summer Rental is still enjoyable. It looks at a man trying to relax at the beach and provide a vacation for his family that they will all remember. He, of course, offends the only person able to ruin his vacation. There are no great lessons in this film. The film quality is minimal, except for wonderful scenes of a sailing race. You do get a great feel for vacation at an East Coast beach community. For the simple fun of seeing Candy try to cope with parenthood and assaults to his manhood, this is a sweet film."
4,Mediocre Laughs,Okay movie--not as funny as 'The Great Outdoors' but still a good John Candy flick and happy to own it. Satisfied overall.
4,Another John Candy Classic!,"This film is a delightful break from the mindless comedy of today. It is not John Candy at his absolute best, however it is most definately worth watching more than once, especially if you are a John Candy fan. Also it's a wonderful trip back into the 1980's! If you grew up in the 80's like I did, or if your just simply a Candy fan, you'll enjoy this movie. Definately worth the money!"
4,Summer Rental,"One of the funniest yet least played John candy Movies. Anyone who sails can appreciate the humor mixed in with very accurate sailing moves. If you're a Captain Ron fan, you definitely need to add this one to your collection."
3,Summer Rental-A Family Movie,"I would just like to say that this movie is great for the whole family. The storyline is about a workaholic, air traffic controller (John Candy) who takes a vacation with his family. With a bunch of mishaps along the way they finally make it to their destination. But relaxation is still not set; more exciting events are set on the beach. (Just watch out for the woman trying to show everyone her breasts.) Have fun watching! Cast also includes: Richard Crenna, Joey Lawerence, Kerri Green. P. S. i wounded up with the little boy that plays like he's picking his nose by the beach house, and i love him to death!lol and my mother went on a double date with John Laroquette in high school."
4,Summer fun for all,"This early John Candy film is often overlooked...This is a shame...The film offers an amusing tale of a father trying to make the best of a bad situation and in between offers a a showcase for Candy and a great supporting cast..Rip Torn(of Larry Sanders show fame)is just fantastic as Pirate Scully...This film is safe for all ages and can stand up to repeated viewings...Actually,I dont even acknowledge summer until I view this film! John Candy,besides being a very funny actor,also in this early film,shows his talents for portraying a sensitive and compassionate man that isnt really seen again until the film 'Only The Lonely'. Any of us who have fond memories of those ""family"" trips will surely get a kick out of Summer Rental....Parents will be pleased that as characteristic of most John Candy films,Vulgarity isnt used to add humor....Make this film a part of your summer experience..!"
5,Great comedy,Johncandy I love this guy in every movie I have seen. this is funny and a very good movie. Should get it if you like him.
3,Summer Rental,I personnally didn't find it as funny as some of John Candy's other performances but still not a bad movie.
5,The way to start summer,"My summer's start with Beach Boys music and this movie (yes, I watch it annually), one of John Candy's best. Rip Torn is a hoot and Richard Crenna is not bad either. A great ending will have you laughing. More comedies should be like this one (clean verbiage and funny). Just kick back and enjoy."
5,John Candy,Being a John Candy Fan this movie is another one in his line of lovable characters portrayed by this actor. Who could not love this guy...at least his acting parts having not known much about his personal life. It is just a shame that he left us at such a young age cause I would have looked forward to many more years of this funny lovable guy !
4,"John Candy's first starring Hollywood role is a very good one. On TV all the time now, didn't need to be cropped much!","Along with Planes, Trains and Automobilesa very funny John Candy vehicle. Burned outair traffic controller (this was a real pro-blem back in the '80's) FINALLY gets vactionand winds up with one-handed pirate friend(superbly played by Rip Torn) and gets intoyaught race v. evil egomaniac (superbly play-ed by late Richard Crenna). Of course Candywins. Soundtrack has lively Jimmy Buffettsong that is not available on Buffett LPs,sorry Parot Heads!"
1,Movie Mars DVD Purchasers Beware,"Why would anyone expect you to understand that a DVD sold in the US with a II in the description means you can't play it in a US DVD player? ""Region 2"" was not noted in the Amazon description nor was anything said in the order confirmation.Item Title Shipped Qty 1Summer Rental [DVD] John Candy; Karen Austin; Kerri Green; Joseph Lawrence (IIShipping a DVD from North Carolina to Florida, somewhere you think it would have dawned on someone to recognize that the product could only be played in ""Japan, Europe, South Africa, and theMiddle East, including Egypt.""Disappointed and Unsatisfied Customer."
1,Total disappointment,I was so excited to buy this movie. I saw it years ago and wanted to add it to my library . It took so long before I got it and when I tried to watch it it wouldn't work. Had some some strange code that an American DVD player didn't recognize. I feel ripped off and so disappointed!
2,"Why Are You Wearing A Hockey Jersey On The Beach, John?","This is by far the lamest vehicle that John Candy ever graced which includes ""The Great Outdoors"". I have nothing against candy softening his image for a mass audience as he demonstrated so masterfully in ""Uncle Buck"" but there's no reason to appear in a flick that is so insignificant and forgettable. Virtually nothing works here. The antagonism between Candy's ""renter"" and Richard Crenna's yachtsman goes nowhere. A possible dalliance between Candy's wife(Karen Austin) and John Larroquette's character is suggested but is dropped like a hot potato. The sole reason to see this flick is the performance of Rip Torn as a salty nautical type. Do yourself a favor and rent National Lampoon's Vacation"" instead. Candy had a walk-on in that flick and probably wished he was still in it."
2,Disappointed,"After having read positive reviews of this movie, I was eager to see it for myself. As a John Candy fan, I wanted to like the movie, but unfortunately it wasn't much more than an elongated TV sitcom. The problem is not with Candy or the other actors, but rather with the uninspired script."
4,Confident second outing,"Mark Weigle largely builds on the strengths of his very good first album. I guess this is more of the same to some extent (no bad thing) but growing confidence in his subject matter shows through songs like Good Day, a bouncy, sexy, uplifting pop number that's great to sing along to. The rest is a nice mix of slow romantic stuff, a bit of country, and the upfront queerness that makes Weigle that bit more interesting."
5,Ally McBeal,"Again, my friend could not find these anywhere and when I gave them to her, she was so HAPPY and could not thank me enough!!!"
4,I wish musicians and DVD publishers would get real !!,"My wife and I fell in love with Ally McBeal when it was in its first run on TV and wanted to buy the series. Unfortunately you could get only partial reproductions in the US market so we bought Series I through 4 from Amazon UK. Also unfortunately, you need a region-free DVD player to run them but I found one for a reasonable price. It was, all-together, an expensive process but we really enjoy them.The one bad thing is that, just like the Northern Exposure DVD's, there are still some problems about reproducing all of the music. You get some samples here and there but not nearly the whole thing and music was VERY important in these series, especially in Ally. Boo Hiss! Why can't the musicians and the DVD producers get together on some kind of compromise? We need a consumer's bill of rights to force them to get together and give us the whole thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Cheap and noisy,"It cools my tiny bedroom, but the girl I'm currently seeing complains she can't sleep when she stays over. This air conditioner is ruining my love life. I'm getting a quieter one."
3,"Don't own it, but be serious folks. FIX it.","If you don't like the ""paddle-boat"" noise, take a 1/8"" drill and make a drain hole at the lowest point. I own a model that annoyed me in the same way... until I got out my trusty DeWalt.I did always wonder if the water helped cool the condenser evaporatively, though."
1,Awful Unit - Noisy!!!,This unit is fine the first few hours of operation and then the condensation begins!!! The unit fills with water after a few hours in the area where the wheel is.... sounds like a loud paddle boat in the room. Spend the extra few dollars for the better machine. This unit is NO BARGAIN!!!
1,Noise,"The previous review was exactly right! The water just hits the fan over and over again, making it almost impossible to sleep if you are hoping to cool off the bedroom. Do not buy this unit. The instruction booklet lists ""water noise"" as being among the acceptable noises that your A/C unit might make. Find a different brand, this one just isn't worth it."
1,Save your money!!!,"Unless you have a 6x6 box you want to cool, put a few extra dollars with what you have and by a better product. This is almost a prime example of, ""getting what you pay for"". I say ""almost"" beause it's not worth what i paid. It does well in a small room with the door closed. But not for a midsized livingroom. The unit fired right up, it does make a little noise, almost as if the fan is batting around water droplets. But as far as performance, unimpressive."
1,"Cheap, Cools Wells But Does Not Last","Bought the 5200 BTU about a month and a half ago for a third floor bedroom. Now before this i had a 5000 BTU panasonic that still works but is not energy efficiant at 15 years old. So i picked up this Haier unit. The price was right and for a little noise i ould deal with it. I have been running the panasonic at a steady 68 degrees for years and no issues, i set the Haier to cool level 5 and 6 mostly and after a month a half the motor is done... I would avoid at all cost"
2,How bad could it really be?,I always wondewred what this thing ran like. Wal-mart sells mass quantities of them. Sometimes as low as $80. If you're dirt poor then get this otherwise just leave it for the energy assistance programs. Its also unlikely you'd have a room 7ft by 10ft.
3,Not as Popular the Black/White Books at Our House,"As my son grew older and more interested in colors, I looked for a book that would delight him as much as ""Black on White"" (also by Tana Hoban) had when he was an infant. I thought this book would fill that description, but it didn't quite fit the bill. It has great photographs, but no text.Despite the catchy, rhyming title, each page shows only a picture of the item: No rhyming text is involved. Although my son likes the brightly colored pictures, he is more interested when I read books with rhythmic texts, such as ""Blue Hat, Green Hat"" by Sandra Boynton."
5,Great for teachers for classroom,I bought this for my grandson class to use. They loved it and have used it many times for crafts.
5,MUST HAVE FOR TEACHERS,I run an afterschool program and have mostly kindergarteners in my classroom. This book is wonderful. I rented it from the library and am now purchasing it for my self. The projects are wonderful and 90% of them use materials I already have in the classroom.DO NOT HESTITATE! This book is amazing!
5,Lovely Addition to an Art Classroom!,"I was given this book as a graduation gift from my mentor. After paging through the book I was inspired for many art history based projects!There are over 20 lessons on full colored, bright pages. Each lesson has a famous artist example and a wonderful lesson based on that artwork. There is an entire page, with the image, that talks about the artist and a few tid bits on their lives. [a perfect amount for elementary level students' attention spans!] In addition to the image and artist info is a step by step instruction to the lesson with pictures! Wonderful.I recently complted a Georgia O Keeffe lesson [cutting flowers] with my third grade and they loved it! I am looking forward to some of the other lessons, like McNeill Whistlers Falling Rocket. [the students make a city scene with fireworks exploding in the sky!] I highly recommend this book as a wonderful supplement to the elementary art classroom."
1,Read the fine print,"Not happy with this product at all. It was a remix of the actual CD I wanted. I feel the information that it was a remix wasn't given clearly, cause I would have never ordered it if it was. When I went back to the site after it had arrived, Remix was barely visible on the picture of the CD shown and no where else in the discription.I think if you are going to sell remixes you should put that as the main header so people know what they are buying...it seems dishonest and sneaky any other way. I'm glad I didn't pay too much money for it, but it sure makes you think twice before buying...."
4,"Not bad, not great","I bought this album expecting to be wowed and instead I was just ""meh"" about it.The album isn't poorly conceived or poorly presented or even poorly played, it's just really, really odd to hear Christmas music like this played on JUST an organ. At times I was wondering if I was listening to carnival music or Christmas music, Jingle Bells and Rudolph come to mind here.If you are a huge fan of organ music and are looking for organ only Christmas music, this will work for you. I was hoping for a little more which is why I've given it four stars instead of 5."
2,"beautiful concept of a Claddagh Cross, but is not what it seems....","Really liked the concept of how this Claddagh Cross looked, however on receipt, it looks very cheaply stamped out & without dimension. A shame, it could be beautiful...."
3,A tantalizing 3-D experience,"This original and unusual anatomy atlas features terrific images either for quality, details and variety of perspectives, offering a 3-D economical alternative to more sophisticated and software-based ones.The CD ROM included allows a sufficient 3-D rotation of the illustrations on Win OS (i.e. Vista).Overall it is worth the money being aware that you'll get something more than pure 2-D and significantly less than any other interactive and flexible higher level neuro atlas.As I said, the CD ROM is running fine with Win while compatibility for Mac users is limited to pre OS 10 era (9.x).Furthermore: the title ""neuroatlas"" sounds misleading while neither spinal cord nor PNS illustrations are included: ""Brain Atlas"" would have been more appropriate.N.B. consultation might turn into a tantalizing experience specially for those suffering from migraine: I would discourage from using those green-red glasses longer than 5 min..."
4,want to be a neurosurgeon?,"If neurosusrgery is in your future, or you just want a rich mental map of brain structures, this is the book for you. Although a bit pricey, it is great. Using the 3D glasses (included) gives you an advantage over your classmates is every way. I knew I was in love with this book when the emotional limbic structures (very complicated 3D) jumped out of the page, or when you are face to face with the eyeballs jutting out at you and all the visual pathways that build into them clearly seen running from the eye all the way to the back of the cerebrum. This book is both an excellent learning tool, and a riviting coffee table book, that will wow your friends, family and every science-oriented kid you meet. A pop up book for adults, with all the details for a neurosurgeon."
4,Very nice!,"These of course are not crystal but they are very nice for glass, heavy duty....was not disappointed!"
2,It's...okay.,"Probably the main reason we use this textbook in my class is that one of the co-authors is a high-up in the Japanese language department at my university. It's not a bad text, but it's really not that great either. On the upside, the book gets into things like Hiragana right away (and Katakana a little later on), so you can quickly ditch romaji, but the Kanji lessons don't start until somewhat later. The recorded materials for Nakama are somewhat lacking in quality, but they're managable. Mostly I guess it's just a textbook, not particularly interesting. It covers new grammar patterns and such pretty quickly, and the explanations aren't always completely clear. There are a number of very useful tables of counters and verb endings and such in the back, though. Overall, it's an okay textbook, but from the things I hear, something like Genki would probably be a better choice."
1,Proofreading problems galore!,"I used this textbook during an intensive course. I think it was chosen for political reasons (the author's reputation or connection). But I found it to be lacking in many ways. First of all it is FULL of typos. In fact, one whole chart was mislabeled. An unsuspecting student might think they were learning the past plain form of the adjective when in fact, they were looking at the polite form. I was very frustrated by the typos. Secondly, I could never find clear grammar explanations. A grammar point would be introduced but there would only be one or two examples of it. Then another grammar point would be thrown in, all mixed together in the examples. I ended up buying a dictionary of grammar, which the teacher recommended when she realized how frustrated some of us were with this book."
2,Not impressed,"This foil cutter requires more effort (a stronger squeeze) than it really ought to, and too much turning. The built-in foil cutter on my ""Boomerang"" brand waiter's corkscrew works more reliably, and requires less effort, and the whole corkscrew hardly costs more than this foil cutter.I had expected that a purpose-built, standalone foil cutter would excel at the task, but this device came up short."
1,Better foil cutters are out there,I have used a number of foil cutters over the years and have found this one to be near useless. It is not a question of quality but rather poor design. I highly recommend the Screwpull brand foil cutter as an alternative.
1,Don't bother!,Horrible! Only two cutting wheels. Does not fit on bottles with an extra wide neck. Flimsy. I would guess that this will break in a month or two. Stick to a Screwpull.
2,Plastic/rubber fell apart,"I got one of these because Metrokane tends to have well designed, nice looking products. It worked just fine for cutting foils off wine bottles, but it failed in quality - the rubber/plastic (not quite sure what it was) seemed to corrode over time and became sticky. It was not like that when we first purchased it. We tried cleaning it with soap and also tried picking off the sticky bits that collected on the black part to no avail. We ended up tossing this as it became too icky to use and went for a screwpull cutter instead."
2,"OK, when it works","I have the four-wheel cutter. It works fine on some bottles of wine, but is useless on others. It takes too much squeezing effort, too many turns, and the result is too iffy. I foolishly picked this up at a discount store without the benefit of Amazon reviews. Should have known better and saved myself the 7 bucks."
5,Wine more!,"This was a gift for someone working at a winery whose foil cutter had broken. She said this was exactly what she needed and wanted to do her job at the winery. I would recommend this for home use as well, who doesn't like wine but hates cutting the foil by hand."
5,wine foil cutter,The product was promptly delivered in new/packaged condition and works just as I had hoped. No more struggles to get through foil or other seals to the cork. I don't need a $50 or more contraption for doing everything but drinking the wine for me. This does the job and a corkscrew opens the bottle. I do the rest.
1,Terrible!,"The rabbit wine bottle opener is fantastic, but the foil cutter is, as someone else noted, near useless. Doesn't fit most wine bottle necks, so you have to squeeze hard and rotate at the same time to get a good cut, and you need the grip of the Incredible Hulk to accomplish this. Don't waste your time. I'm going to go for the Screwpull."
1,"Works on some bottles, but not on most.","Whether this foil foil cutter will work on any given wine bottle depends on the shape of the top of the bottle. I know, they're all round, haha, but some have more of a pronounced step about a quarter of an inch down from the bottle top than others. I've given up on this foil cutter and found that the two other ones I've tried have worked much better."
2,Is not able to cut through about 50% of the foils I try to open,The blade on this foil cutter is not sharp enough to open about half of the wines I drink. I would recommend looking elsewhere for your foil cutter.
1,This stinks,"Oh wow, I love the velvet corkscrew but this foil cutter really sucks. I thought it was suppose to be ""velvet."" I don't have the strength to squeeze it hard enough to do the job. A big thumbs down. Don't buy it."
1,almost useless,"it seems to have been designed with a much wider bottle neck in mind, because it doesn't fit a standard one. it requires a huge effort to squeeze the sides together to cut the foil. buy a Screwpull - you'll be much happier."
1,The book was awful!!!,"This was a waste of time. The character development was very light, the plot was predictable, and the story was poorly done. It lacked depth and the actions of the characters was not realistic."
5,great!!!,"If you are ready, willing and able take time out and read a great book!!! I read this book in no time...it just flowed. I loved the characters, especially Fannie. I was just glad Noon finally got the chance to ""express"" herself."
4,Great,"Tumbling was my 1st time reading by the author, and I must say that I truly enjoyed reading this book, especially towards the end alot of twist!!! 1st I found myself laughin and cryin..great job"
5,I fell in love with Tumbling!,"A wonderfully wild and romantic journey into the 60's with a simple family who make you laugh, cry, and ultimately REJOICE! This sweet love story is so vivid. You'll feel like you're right there experiencing the ups and downs with Herbie and Noon. Excellent reading!!"
5,THANK HEAVENS FOR TUMBLING!!,THE BOOK WAS WONDERFUL! I COULD'NT NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN! I READ ALL THRU THE NIGHT ALL PRIASE TO DIANE FOR THIS BOOK IT BROUGHT SO MUCH JOY TO MY LIFE IT'S A BOOK THAT I WILL GLADLY PASS ON TO MY CHILDREN AND THEIRS LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE BOOK IS A SMALL PIECE OF HEAVEN!
5,A must-have CD!,"Take three sisters with similar, exquisite voices, mix those voices together in unusual ways, add a few instruments and what you get is The Heaths. All three started out as accomplished classical musicians, but blend folk, jazz, sacred harp, and rounds into their songs. Whether it is the charming rendition of Livingston Taylor's Pajama Song, or the funky So Glad I'm Here, or the truly unique Uh Oh, this is a recording to savor. Songs written by the sisters themselves are destined to become classics in their own right. This live recording has a lot spirit and fun to it."
2,Expired??,"I have used this perfume for a long time and for some reason it smelled ""stale"" to me I don't know if perfume has an expiration date, but if it does, then this bottle i bought has expired."
2,"The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts: Men of the Hour, Johnny Carson & Ed...",I did not care for this because it did not spend enough time on each comedian. I believe I returned it.
1,Nothing great about this Cd,"I give this cd a -1. I got nothing good to say about this cd. Didn't like it at all. Not worth listen too this CD. Definitely a waste of money. Thank God for refunds! The music it's the same routine over and over! this is just another ""Canned artist"". About the songs,they were repetitive tunes, no originality, boring beats, unrealistic lyrics and the singer..absolutely not an impressive voice. If you looking for a good worth latin music singer with great voice and songs...try someone else, like Luis Fonsi, Juanes, Sin banderas, etc.. No wonder! I'm the first on this site leaving a review and I'll probably be the last!"
4,Delightful film about provincial French children,"This episodic story of a year in the life of a group of children and their families in provincial France is one of Truffaut's most delightful films. It's full of gentle humor and poignancy and the kind of understated observation that one associates with Truffaut. I recently saw it for (I believe) the fourth time, and it holds up beautifully. Highly recommended.~Dan Oliver"
5,Wonderful!,"Truffant took everyday kids during the summer of 1975 and made a movie with them about the everyday life and issues of children. It can be silly, but it's very real. A wonderful gem. In my top ten favorite films of all times."
5,great re-release,this is a great re-release of the original album with the added bonus mesmerize ep and 2 other b sides but i was dissapointed that they had removed some of the samples from the song deli. i am assuming there was a copyright issue. i had to go and hunt down the original version to be fully satisfied. the old eversion is a double disc including some remixes of we are the beautiful and the epic picnic...which are available on rownderbowt. the new version works well with the added tracks at the begining of the disc cause they were recorded first and the flow of the disc as they evolve in their new sound works in this format.
2,Tedious and dull.,"I was very disappointed with Blood Music, from Chapterhouse. I purchased Whirpool, from them several years ago and it may as well be a totally different band. Whirpool was so lush and melodic in comparison. Blood Music, to me sounded like they just ran out of enthusiasm. The music is much more of a straight forward Techno, Dance effort with some very meandering ambient songs that have very little if any real melodic value. It just plain didn't move me like Whirlpool. Too bad."
1,Repetitive techno-rock...disco without any soul...,Repetitive techno-rock...disco without any soul. I just don't get it.
4,Rising Star,"Though Ted Alexandro comes across better on tv, this CD is a hoot. I wish he'd make another. Every now and again, I check to see if he's come out with a new one.I for one, can't wait.Former Comedienne,L"
3,Liked it,"I was a bit disappointed since there was a lot of material on the CD that I had already heard from his TV appearances and website, but it's an old CD, so I should have expected that. He's a funny guy--if his ""old stuff"" still makes you laugh, then you'll like this CD."
5,Duermete mi Niño,"Loved the cd - my son likes to listen to it, too. I especially like the fact that the lyrics are included so that mommy could memorize them and sing to baby."
5,My soundtrack for life,"I've been a RSB fan for a few years, and I'm so glad their music will reach a wider audience now that they're signed. This album is great. It's worshipful, honest, beautiful, earthy, and rockin'. Robbie's got an incredible voice, and it's about time churches pick up on honest songs like this. The songs are about God, life, history, roots, community, grace, and hope. Musically, it's laid back acoustic rock similar to Travis, with some Texas influence. Ryan, the bass player is one of the most creative and talented players you'll ever hear. Do yourself a favor and get this CD. Then take a long drive and immerse yourself in the music."
5,Will bring you to your knees,"I came across ""Better Days"" the song on a WOW CD I bought while in Houston. The song, the voice, the message had me intrigued---who is Robbie Seay (band)! I arrived back on my base and ordered Better Days [the album]. I fell in love with the voice, the lyrics, the melodies. Some of the tracks are slow, and full of ""God's Breathe"". My favorites are Better Days (I play it every morning while getting ready for work), Faith of Our Fathers, Eternal God, and my all time favorite ""Jesus, Garden of My Rest"". I have to say that Jesus, Garden of My Rest literally brought me down to my knees crying and praising our Lord. The songs have touched me like no other song has. Michael W. Smith comes pretty close however.I am eagerly looking for more RSB albums, and will snatch them up as soon as they hit.Thank you, Robbie, for helping me fall even deeper in love with Christ.FQAl Asad, Iraq"
1,not my thing,"The music stinks to me, but the dude does have a nice voice. I have to admit I dont like Contemprary Christian Music, just Jesus rock like REZ band or Glen Kyser blues Band."
4,gets to your emotions,"great quality, good characters, good basis for the storyline. also did great on the artistry. I especially like the main character."
5,My Thesis,"Home Truths has been an important aspect in my Honours Thesis, Home and the Practices of Home Making in Gerringong, NSW. The idea of the sensory home has become quite apparent in my interviews of women in Gerringong and Pink's comments coorelate with these women's ideas."
2,Hoped for More Muscle,"This was probably a great magazine article before being padded out with geography and feminism history lessons. The story of the team and girls is great, but too much non-basketball stuff. Also more about the years they didn't win to set the stage would have been nice."
5,Beautiful story,"This book is beautiful. Not only does it capture the the beauty and wonder of womens' basketball, but it also captures the heart and soul of each player. Motivation is not something that is hard to find in these girls and as a result, this book is inspiring. And if you're not a basketball fan or player, this story is just plain good to read. I've read it atleast five times and I never get tired of the humor, inspiration and wonderful quality of writing. Anyone who can read it should."
4,"In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle",My wife requested that we get the book. From what I here she is enjoying the book. Our son is a womens basket Coach for a University in Portland OR. He has enjoy the book also.Sam
5,Excellent book!,"There are more high school girls in sports today than ever before. Unfortuantely, the sports literature has not quite kept pace. This book helps rectify that situation. Madeleine Blais tells a great story of persistence, teamwork, and drive that all students need to learn if they are to succeed in a world based on competition. She writes with a journalist's eye and it is easy for the reader to place the team's quest in the larger context of the role of women in American society (but I do not see a feminist agenda being promoted here). A great story told well!"
3,Too much information,"I love basketball! I played it and I've coached it. I chose this book to find out the story of a team and how it got its act together to be successful.Well, I got that information, but it was mixed up with lots of other factoids that I really didn't care about. You were told about the town, the colleges, the weather, the families of the players, the kinds of summer jobs the players had, whether they were popular or not....the list goes on and on.The writing was descriptive, but I feel like the author just got bogged down by too many details. This book wasn't what I hoped for."
4,"In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle","In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle is an extremely uplifting story that shows what young women can do when they put everything they have into it. I really enjoyed this book because it not only portrayed basketball scenes, but also the storys of all of the girls on the team. The down-to-earth stories of small town girls allowed me to realize that these were real girls who accomplished something that had eluded them for years. Although at times, the story seemed to not move along fast enough, for the most part it left me always wanting to read more. The ending of In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle left me utterly speechless with a huge smile on my face. The joy and triumph that the Amherst Lady Hurricanes felt literally jumped of the page and into my heart."
5,This book was one of the best I've ever read.,"This book was exciting. It was about high school basketball at it's finest. My favorite basketball player, Jamila Wideman, is a main character in the book, so, of course, I loved it. Even if you hate basketball, you'll love it, it's hard not to. Madeline Blais is an excellent writer and I wish there were only more people to write as great as her."
5,What a pleasant and breathless trip !!!,"First,""The man of Rio"" is a very well done comedy and a nice adventure story, although the archeological facts are fully invented. It's pleasant to see these wonderfull actors playing the french 60's way, which was , dynamic, young and with a good rythm. This film will make you do a wonderfull smilly travel in the world and in time. It take place in Paris in the 60's and go on in the Brasil of the the 60's, and especially in Rio de Janeiro, which was still magic at this time. You will even see that somme scenes had been made in the city of Brasilia when it was under construction...That makes the film a bit historical...for brazilian people...Anyway, don't miss one of the monuments of the french 60's ""nouvelle vague""."
3,Endless silly stunts. Entertaining if that's what you like.,"Endless silly stunts. Entertaining if that's what you like.Not particularly creative and certainly not suspenseful. It proceeds from one familiar stunt to another.I give it three starts because i viewed it for the French, and the subtitles are in brilliant yellow."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I have four little guys and not enough time to do a full review, but take it from me -- this was one of the worst dvds I have ever purchased. Don't waste your money on this one - absolutely the worst. One of my boys will watch absolutely anything and even he walked out of the room. Two thumbs down!!!!"
3,A Collection of Religious tunes,I love Ken Overcast but this CD contains only religious music. Wished I had looked the song titles over closer. If you are a christian who likes cowboy music then this CD is for you. Otherwise. . .
3,Not exactly spectacular,"After reading many reviews and researching online I decided to try Herculiner for an unorthodox use ,it just seemed like it was going to work fine ; I used it to create a protective coat on the bottom of my Emotion Glide kayak , since it was taking a lot of abuse launching of concrete boat ramps and from rocks and logs when I stopped at the river banks , it got several deep scratches and adding this super though liner to it sounded like a good idea , but ...Nothing sticks to Polyethylene , no glue or Coating , this plastic is very though to work with , the Herculiner looked very nice , but it just peeled off any time it came in contact with anything rough in big chunks , I know it was not supposed to be used in this kind of application but a disappointment none the less .Later on I found out , quite by accident , that rubberized undercoating for cars works great on Poly , and is very resistant to abrasion so this worked great on my kayak , success finally !!"
3,okay,"Ordered and received fairly quickly without issue. Item as described. Great price for the bed liner coating. Is thin and will probably need several coats, otherwise fine."
5,This seems to the the super stuff!,"I used this to protect the under side panels at wheel level on the exterior of my F350. The panels have seen a lot of scratching over the years and this was a viable & economical solution verses constant repainting. Its all about prep but i tell you after this stuff sets it is like alligator skin. I gave mine a week because I applied in early fall and it was cool.Oh and by the way when they say wear gloves do so. I'm glad I did because after removing the tape I took my gloves off so I could remove the the tape using my finger nails and the little bit I got on my hands took a lot of pumice stone to remove it.That how tough this stuff is. Expect to do numerous coats be cause you won't get good coverage with just one. I did 14"" up on both sides of my truck and some of the tail gate and still had an eighth of a quart left. I used the roller in the kit because other rollers will disintegrate form the chemical compounds."
3,Poorly Written,"As someone who will read anything about Rangers I knew I was in trouble a few pages into the book and I didn't think I wanted to finish it. This book seems to be a poorly thrown together collection of anecdotes, unnecessary appendices and the authors own political viewpoints. The anecdotes/oral history content was both the best and worst of the book. The good ones (such as the Ranger Battalion Surgeon) I found to be extremely interesting however, most were expletive laced blog type content that held no historical value for me whatsoever. It's a good looking (and extremely heavy) book but I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,"If you are interested in the 75th Ranger Regiment, avoid this book","I am a Ranger currently serving in 2nd Batt at Ft. Lewis. This book is very poorly written, and is interjected with the political views of the auther (someone who could have used a ghost-writer). I appreciate Mir's service, but I wasted money on this book on my last deployment, introducing it to the burn pile rather than lugging it back home. It did do well on the fire, so if you want to shell out your money for bonfire fuel, be my guest. If you want accurate and well-written information on my beloved regiment, look elsewhere!"
1,Very let down.....,"If you wanna learn about ranger history after 1974, there is a lot of basic info in here. If you wanna learn about anything before 1974 - go somewhere else. The history of the ranger up to 1974 is compressed into 100 pages and I found one MAJOR mistake - the author claims that the 2nd ranger bn was not the first unit on top of point du hoc, he claims that the 116th reg of the 29th infantry was there first. He even quotes a section of stephen ambrose's ""D-day"" to back it up, only he quotes from the chapter about the 5th rangers and the 116th at Omaha. If he made a simple mistake like that one, how do I know that the rest of the book isnt filled them? All in all, I'm glad I got this book as a gift, because it isnt worth the money....."
1,Poorly written,"As a former 2/75 Ranger I basically bought the book to find out about more recent missions and activities of the Regiment. I found the book to not be a history as much as a personal opinion of political decisions, the Regiment and the Army. Time and time again he uses his opinion as part of the history and uses ""his experience"" to speculate what might have happened. I expected a history but that is not what this is. I wish I hadn't of spent the money on this book."
3,Love Story.,"I saw this picture when it first came out about 40 years ago. It is more like a ""B"" rated movie to me and more of a ""chick flick"" than I remembered. However, the story line is good."
5,Love Story,An excellent movie for the time! Such true love of two young college students! A very sad ending but great movie.
3,DON'T BULL $ # I T ME!,"'Love Story' was the talk of the town in it's day, but the years have not been too kind to the film. The story of the rich man meets poor girl is interesting enough, but the dialogue is a bit dated. O'Neal and MacGraw are appealing, but both characters have feeling of inadequacies that make them slightly irritating. In the end, the love between them is believable and heartfelt, insuring the finale being quite sad. The film score is so recognizable, it's like the definitive score for romance films! Look fast for a young Tommy Lee Jones! The DVD has a good transfer and the extras are interesting."
5,Love Story,"The movie Love Story is indeed all about love. The bantering between the two stars in their relationship keeps the story light until the final stages. Highly recommend this movie, but not if you have lost a loved one recently; the emotions will all flood back."
4,I love this movie,"Okay, I'm not good with all this mushy romance stuff, but I found myself drawn to Ali McGraw's witty character, Jenny.It's truly a wonderful movie, but now, after many films are based on the same thing (girl with terminal disease, lover devastated), it's gotten a bit old. I still refer to this movie as ""the first - and best - of many."" I didn't exactly like Ryan O'Neal's character, Oliver, because he was just too deep to me. Sorry, true love makes me sick. Other than that, this movie is the only drama-total romance one I can stand. Definitely a must-see."
3,Flash from the past,"My wife and I purchased the video for a couples Valentine party in our home. As baby-boomers it was chosen as a flash from the past from when most of us were either dating or first married.It was both touching and funny to watch this old movie with friends as our perspective is a lot different 30 some years later. Overall the plot is a bit thin and is a bit implausable and we were not entirely happy with all of the language as Ali McGraw has a rather foul mouth in the film.Overall, it worked fairly well for our purposes of attempting to capture a ""romantic"" film from the past for our group. I think the concepts in the film appealed more to us when we were in our teens and rebelling against authority than today."
2,Freshman week movie at Harvard and Radcliffe,"This is schmaltzy and silly, but it is a real period piece. For years it has been a highlight of freshmen week at Harvard and Radcliffe. Students watch it, laught at it, and then incorporate (sometimes unintentional) jokes from it into freshman repartee.If you want to get a sense of a bestselling book and a major box office event of the early 1970s, see this movie ( or read the book). Suspend critical judgment and take it for what it is---a lightweight, idealized romance of postadolescence."
3,Love Story,There was to much profanity. The story itself is good. When I saw it on the TV years ago I didn't remember all of the use of profanity. If I had I wouldn't have order it.
3,A Love Story,"The acting isn't that good. However, this movie is guaranteed to make you cry. It is a classic tearjerker. The musical score of the movie is terrific and won awards. This movie is mostly for people who saw it years ago and would like to see it again to bring back memories."
1,Cynical exploitation,"I think this is one of the worst films ever made. It is insincere and cynical, and really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Made by a sensitive director, this could have been a wonderful film, but as it is ......... The song's good, shame about the cast."
1,i did not love this story,"I seriously must say that Love Story is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I rented it, anticipating an emotional, tear-jerking masterpiece; man, was I disappointed. The script consists of some of the CHEEZIEST lines- ""being in love means never having to say your sorry"" PLEASE- and the acting is laughable. These kids are supposed to be full of youthful energy and passion- they look about as passionate as a cess pool. Oh, and they could have picked a more varied musical selection- they played the same repetitvely boring theme over and over!"
3,"I'm a chick flick lover, but even this was TOO much for me","I know it sounds very sad, but I saw ""Love Story"" on WE. That is the ultimate lonely woman scenario. I'm a fan of classic romantic movies like ""Notorious"" and ""Wuthering Heights,"" and I'm a pretty big fan of sophisticated, classy chick flicks. ButLove Story was just to saccharine, too perfect, which I find revolting. It had its nice moments, but it just dragged on and became revolting. But I was born in the late 80s, so you might understand my opinion that I'm not from this 70s era. The Jenny character I found quite annoying, with her constant pestering. But some positive notes, I liked the opening scene and Oliver's opening statement. I also liked the concept of how the only thing that would reunite the father and the son, is Oliver's love for Jenny. I suppose it was a pretty good movie when you're bored. Obviously, its pretty predictable."
4,Love Story is worth watching.,"This 1970's Classic is the best love story i have seen. Anybody who has seen this movie can totally relate to these characters in some form. They fall in love and cross social barriers and marry and face the biggest crisis of thier lives. this film has a common theme which is ""Love does conquer all""."
5,Love Story....I loved it !,Great Movie...the quality of the disc was great ! It was very quick getting to me. I bought two copies of it..one for My Parents since I was named after the movies main character. Thank You I will buy again from the seller.
2,love story,"This movie was very short and I remember it being much longer. I bought it so my son could see it since he lost his wife to ovarian cancer, but was disappointed because I remembered more than was on the disk."
2,Great Classic but...,"Oh yes, this story to many older generation is the starting point and the beginning of love stories drama. The story of this movie is very touching but for now a days the acting is not all that.I recommend reading the book. But still it is ""the"" classic love movie of all time..!"
2,why does everyone think this love story is so great?,"well it's not. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and i don't absolutely despise it, but I do strongly dislike it it. Why?, well, first of all, the story itself is very unoriginal. It's all been done before. Poor little rich boy falls for the actual poor girl. Parents dissaprove, and then, in the end, the girl ends up dying, and the guy mourns. I'm sorry, I just donot find any sentimental value in this film.There is no real chemistry between the actors, and the try way too hard to be all witty. There are too many cheesy lines between the two main characters for this to ever qualify for a great love story. Love stories are full of sincerity, and life. Not sappy,overacted bull. That's not called a love story, that's called a movie."
4,I can't wait to get it,"I purchased this book for my cousin as a Christmas present this year. I looked at all of the recipes and decieded that I needed a fondue pot! My husband got me the fondue pot, now I must get this book. There is such a variety of things to make in this book from your basic cheese fondue to dishes I hadn't even thought of making in a fondue pot."
3,"hell and pacifism in one book , love it",this was written in a different period and the style shows that to be the case as I found it rather awkwardto read ! she seems to wonder off on more than a few occasions and never appears to nail any points although she doesoffer a few good arguments .she is a pacifist [ I'm not] and offers weak arguments in supporting her position and her understanding on hellis about as weakly argued ! she claims hell is ''a possibility'' without ever offering supporting biblical evidence and doesn'taddress the only other position that is truly biblical ''universalism''
5,Worked perfectly,Considering the bulb I was replacing was over 30 years. This was perfect. It was easy to install and worked.
2,Didn't match our 30-year old sets,"After 30 years of use, our 68-piece set had become a 57-or-so piece set, so we ordered 5 place settings to replace the pieces which had gone missing (less expensive than ordering individual pieces). The new settings are quite different than our originals, differing in color, weight, backstamping, and (in the case of the dinner knives) construction. Correspondence with Oneida confirmed that they are probably genuine Oneida pieces. However, they're now made in Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia or China, so I suspect they have quality control issues. Oneida suggested I might return them if I was unsatisfied (which I am), but then I'd be back at square one, missing pieces. My solution is to serve more drinks before dinner, and lower the lighting in the dining room."
5,Chateau review,"The Oneida Chateau place settings arrived on time, and are perfect. I have had the same pattern for the last 40 years, and was delighted to find replacements an exact match. I was never able to find them in any shop,and my daughter suggested Amazon. So happy with the whole transaction. Thanks."
2,A little misleading,"The products is good, but the labeling suggests the item considered is actually a 5 PLACE set, 5 forks, 5 spoons and so on. The dimensions say 2 lbs. That is probably OK. Then shipping weight says 11 ounces. I bought 2 orders and received 10 ITEMS, or $5 per fork and spoon and knife. This one has got to go back. Target has a 4 place set for $30 something. Not sure how this one will end yet."
5,Blue and friends put on a show - and you help!!,"This is one of the better companion books to this popular kids television show, and complements the Blue's Big Musical movie. Pictures are drawn in a coloring book format and many stickers are included, as well as cut-out characters and a cut-out stage. There is a lot to do here, with some help needed for cutting, and the story of Steve and Blue and all the usual characters getting their show ready is not only entertaining and instructive for kids, but is a great setup for children's continuing play using their own ideas for the actual (or their own) show. Nicely done."
4,So happy to know about this.,"My uncle, Claude Vaughn, Jr. died on this ship the U.S.S, Cooper. I have been researching the history of the World War II battles and this video helped me in my journey to add one more piece to the puzzle."
3,Basic Knowledge For Parents,"This book was just okay, it has a few good points but most of it was common knowledge if you are in touch with your children and how to manage their behavior...great book to get from the libray, not one to purchase."
2,No More Misbehavin': 38 Difficult Behaviors and How to Stop Them,This book was not very good. It doesn't give enough solutions to behavior problems.
1,"Disappointing, fails to live up to title's promise","This is a simplistic parenting overview -- not a series of solutions for a child's most difficult behaviors. The traits included are very significant and deserve serious treatment, not matter-of-fact tips that can be found in any parenting magazine which is what the book contains.For example, the chapter on bossiness - a complex and serious negative behavior trait - gives three overly simplistic tips and then asks the parent to consider a series of questions about why the trait is bothersome. It does a very poor job of explaining the root of bossiness and gives overly simplistic advice, like ""raise the child's self-esteem."" If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't have had to buy the book!Try another resource. This one won't help."
2,Not useful for our child,"The title was rather seductive ... but I was disappointed, if validated. I am by no means mom of the year, but I think I already follow most of what the book suggests. This book is likely good for parents who are gobsmacked by newly emerged bad behaviors and recalcitrance, but those of us who have spent any time with the ""Spririted,"" ""Explosive"" and ""Active/Alert"" child books will have seen/implemented most of the recommendations already."
3,OK but not geared towards young kids,We were looking for something to help out with our toddler's temper tantrums. This did not help as much as I hoped.
5,where have they been?,"Well, I thought I was a fan of The Shadow radio shows from the 1930's. I've heard a bunch, and own a bunch, and in this box set here's only two I've heard before--""Prelude to Terror,"" about a loony who concocts exploding light bulbs and plants them in strategic buildings. [..] then there's ""Reflection of Death,"" about a mirror from Inferno itself--or is it now? Many of these feature Bill Johnstone as the Shadow, and believe me, he may have been the best of any of the men who played that role. Each man brought his own flair to the role. the one I like least is kid Orson Welles, who hadn't yet panicked America and made his name forever. When these shows were made, he was still riding by ambulance from show to show--no joke, he did just that. This is money well spent."
2,"The video is very dark, making it difficult to view in many of the outdoor scenes.","Apparently the master from which this DVD was made has not been properly preserved. The original program was broadcast in 1997, not all that long ago. Because this DVD copy was made for PBS such poor quality is difficult to understand."
3,Argh! Bathtime fun fer yer wee maties!,"My kids (2 & 5) are big fans of the Backyardigans, especially the Pirate adventure episode. (Confession time: Mom & Dad are rather fond of that episode too. ""Argh!"")They really enjoy the Pirate Tub Time Adventure playset. It's quite a tub-worthy vessel. The only problems are (1) the mast does not snap firmly into the base, so it's always falling off and (2) only Captain Uniqua and Captain Pablo are included. The wee maties missed Captains Tyrone and Austin."
2,Is it right for my toddler?,"While it looks like fun and does float, we found that the pole that the sail is on doesn't fasten correctly and so as soon as the child grabs it, the sail & pole pop off of the boat and doesn't fasten back on well. The characters that come with the ship have room inside for storage but must be placed in an exact & specific way usually too complex for a toddler, While there is an area to snap the treasure chest into that will secure it, there is no way to keep one of the characters behind the wheel. If you are looking for all of the peices to be apart & floating in the tub, it works.This product didn't meet our expectation though and we are returning it."
1,"If you want a shipwreck, buy this toy","My son got this for Christmas and used it for the first time today. There is a molded piece of plastic inside the boat where the figures are stored. It is balloon like (hollow but enclosed) with indentations for the figures. It attaches to the bottom of the boat by two screws. But there are also two holes all the way through to the bottom of the boat (which I didn't see until it sunk) so when you put it in the water it fills up with water and capsizes. Now there's about 1/4 cup of water inside this balloon like thing that I can't get out. I don't know if I received a defective one or what as other reviewers have said it floats. If you take your chance on this toy, be sure to look for and seal the holes with silicone or something. Also, the sail does not stay attached and the treasure chest looks like it should scoop and sprinkle water but it's pretty much useless. I am very disappointed!"
2,Very disappointed,"This was a great idea, very poorly implemented. First of all, the sail will not stay on and is a constant source of frustration for my daughter. Next, only Pablo and Uniqua are included. Third, Uniqua and Pablo do not stand on the boat, but constantly fall over. Plus, the paint started chipping of the figures about a week after we got them. Finally, where's the plank and why have a treasure chest with no treasure inside??"
4,My son likes it,"Yes, the sail comes off -- and Pablo's paint too. But my son, who's 3, isn't much bothered by any of that. He just likes playing with the ship, the treasure chest, and with Pablo -- in or out of the bathtub. So if he's happy I can't give it a bad review.Now if they would just make Captain Austin and Captain Redboots from the Pirate Camp episode..."
3,Hide the Pirates and Glue the Mast In,"I read the reviews and bought this toy anyway, not anticipating just how annoying it would be for the mast to constantly fall out and for the pirates to not stand up on the ship when it is in the water. My son doesn't understand yet (he's 22-months) that they won't stand up and he gets really frustrated. He also thinks the best way to pick the boat up is with the mast, which it is. However, every time he does this, the mast falls off. I will be hiding the pirates until he gets older, and I will be gluing the mast in. Just a couple tips.Update (7/21/09): After a while, the boat takes on water that never comes out. I threw it away, despite how much my son loved it, because I was afraid of the mildew!"
2,Floats but too many pieces,"This toy seemed great from previous reviews, but it has far too many pieces for the suggested age range.The characters, mast, sails, treasure chest and deck of the boat all come apart, making it more of a hassel to get it all together for bathtime enjoyment."
3,Fun bath toy,"My son really enjoys playing with this toy. But he wants the other characters--it only comes with the two shown. The boat does float but Pablo and Uniqua don't stand on it very well. My son usually has them diving off the side of the tub or ""swimming"" deep in the ""sea"" so it doesn't matter much to him. I do wish I could find the other three characters. It's nice that they don't have any holes for water to get inside. So that's my only real complaint--we need Tyrone, Austin and Tasha!"
2,not really a tub toy...,"My duaghter (she just turned 2)loves the Backyardigan's (as do I) so I think that she love's just having this as a toy. However, we cannot have a pirate adventure in the tub, because the figurines cannot stay on the boat unless it is totally immobile, and even then you have to place them very carefully. They slip and slide as they are plastic and so is the boat deck. The sail constanly comes off. I have had to glue it on. We mostly play with this on the bedroom floor.Also, it would be nice if the other pirate characters were available, even at an extra cost, but I have not seen them anywhere. Argh!All in all, I am disappointed. They should be made to walk the plank for this."
1,This toy leaves horribe black paint marks all over the tub.,"Lousy quality. Horrible black paint marks. Do not recommend. Do not buy, unless you don't mind a real paint mess. Also, Uniqua and Pablo shed their paint rapidly. (-1 Star)"
5,Fun in the tub!,"This is a simple pirate ship tub toy with two backyardigans characters. My pirate enthusiasts (ages 6, 4 and 2) love it. It doesn't move or make noise, but it floats well and is sturdy. The best part is that the characters fit in the bottom of the ship for easy storage."
2,just okay,the boat does not stay together in the tub. my 2-year-old son enjoys the little characters but not the boat.
4,"cute, the sail needs work","My 2 year old and almost 5 year old love this toy. Its cute and fun in the bath. Only complaint is our sail/pole also does not stay in very well, it falls out very easily. I am thinking about using super glue to fix it permenently. Other than that, they love it!!"
3,Looks okay,I haven't had it out of the wrapping yet and it looks new so I have high hopes. I can't remember if I bought this new or used so I am going to wait until I view it to give a final review.
1,Disappointed,"As a teacher, I was delighted to find School House Rock for Grammar. Since I had an old copy, I was thinking this would be a more recent edition. Sadly, it turned out to be the same one I already had. It's a Windows 95 platform so my classroom computer can't run it. I thought by now there would have been an updated version because it's a wonderful program. Order date: 10/29/11 #178046 Children's Software Online sold it through Amazon and does suggest help for Windows 7 Users Now I'm hoping to find a way to make it work."
2,I Wish I Knew This Was A British Book,The problem I had with this book was finding the supplies in it. The book is from England and most of the supplies are from companies over there. I finally found them on the internet but couldn't afford the shipping. It is a wonderful book if only I had access to all the beautiful supplies it listed for each craftf. I had to substitute every single thing so I didin't get the look I wanted on most of the cards.
3,I've got great big Christmas balls.,"John Boy & Billy are American radio hosts based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Their show is almost exclusively broadcast in the South, so I've never heard it. This CD features Christmas themed comedy bits broadcast on their show. The CD leads off with ""Blue Christmas"" sung in the style of Porky Pig. This hilarious recording is semi-legendary among fans of Christmas comedy. Another very funny song is ""Christmas Balls"". Most of the other tracks here involve characters from the radio show. They are somewhat funny, but I don't always ""get"" them, since I'm not familiar with the show. But fans of the show will probably find it to be very funny."
3,Not bad,"I ordered the book and after looking at it there is a lot to like (2d10 vs d20, skills system) but there are a few things I really wish it had. One of the first things I look for are character examples, it helps me absorb the rules better and get a good idea of how the skills and stats are. I would also like to see an advanced character's character sheet (if you guys are reading this, pls put one on your website). Character advancement could be more clear. It seems a lot of things are missing. A nice group session example would have been great too."
5,Hurricane Fogger,"Excellent! Wonderful! Reliable! Will fog any liquid, even corrosives. Adjustable to control the amount of fog. Can run empty without damage. No, I'm not the manufacturer or a dealer. I own a remediation company and am an end user."
2,Not too impressed,I bought the Hurrican fogger several years ago. The blue plastic tank top cracked up like it was uncured plastic still shrinking. JB Weld was the only fix. After several more hours hours of use it just quit running. I found it was not made to be repaired in any easy way. I got maybe 4 hours of use out of it. I wouldn't buy another at half the price.
3,This is ridiculous.,"The item is probably fine. I attempted to cancel the transaction 2 days after making it, I was told that they could not and it had already shipped. 4 days later I got a notice that the item had just shipped. The cost of the item makes it a stupid move to even return the thing since I will spend more shipping it back than I will get for the return. It's not an Amazon problem but I would expect better from a seller on Amazon. I'm sure the item is fine, not really thinking someone needs a review of a water heater pressure relief valve but I will give one anyway.This valve is the one that normally comes with all GE water heaters and many other brands from the factory. If GE and other manufacturers feel that it's a good enough valve to install new on their product then it's probably a quality product."
1,Stuck it to me in Shipping charges,"Watch your S&H charge when placing an order. What appeared to be a good deal was quickly lost when the shipping charge was $39.78 for the least expensive option. Also, Amazon advertized a $25 coupon for orders over $150. Yet when the order was placed, the coupon would not work. I call that ""bait-n-switch"". All I can say is buyer beware!"
5,"GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD","The words are nice and smooth, the music is excellent, the sound is just great. and it is good dancing music. It is good working music."
5,Big help for Lactose intolerance,"My husband and I have used Say Yes to Dairy for years, and it is absolutely wonderful.The taste is good, you chew the tablets, and for those of us who can't eat cheese or icecream or drink milk otherwise, this makes life bearable again. Even Pizza is now back on the foodlist. LOL"
2,Better packaging needed for items like paint,"The green tempora paint was just put into a box with other items such as Goldflsh crackers...and the paint top cracked opened and I had green paint over everything. My son loves the paint, but I didn't so much love the mess I had to clean simply to use the paint for the first time. After it was all cleaned, I only had about half the bottle left of usable paint as the rest was all over the box and crackers. I wish Amazon would have packaged this better."
4,Good,I purchased this and a fish eye lens for my son for his birthday and he was very happy with them and they are working just fine.
2,Body Glove 540 Mens Long Arm Lycra Rash Guard,"Royal/Black/White shirt. Of the semi-affordable rash guard shirts available through Amazon this was the best I could find (without motifs like skulls). After receiving it I compared it to a similarly priced Quicksilver (purchased elsewhere) and returned the Body Glove shirt to Amazon. The Quicksilver shirt fit better (both mediums) and looked better. The Body Glove shirt looks like it's from the nineties while the Quicksilver shirt is modern and well-designed. You may want to look elsewhere for good rash guard shirts, Amazon doesn't have this area covered."
4,"Good Looking, but Small","I purchased this particular rash guard in red/black because I really liked the design and chose the XL after reading reviews that noted the sizing runs rather small. I am absolutely delighted with both the design (looks even better in person) and fit, but here is where I confess that I am a busty female who wears a 12 in girl sizes. I don't know how most men would fit into this thing, but I would recommend it for average-to-large females."
2,Happy Honu,Great looking shirt but very very small. I ordered 2 sizes up and still had to return it. Great speedy service both in receiving the order and return.
2,Buy with Caution,"Oster was the go-to brand for me, so I purchased the 6608 to make smoothies. After two uses, the black plastic screw-on base decided to start chipping off around the drive gear. The terrible odor of hot plastic caught my attention, so I lifted the blender jar to find black plastic shreds on the base. Not wanting to spend $100+ for a blender AND wanting a metal drive motor, I even-exchanged it at the store for the same model. Time will tell if this one holds up. Shoulda kept my old harvest gold Oster I sold at a garage sale a few years back!"
1,Same problem as others,"The plastic bottom is very cheap and wore almost instantly. I have just covered my kitchen in the soup I took a long time to make as it finally gave up the ghost. Very poor product, I won't go near them again."
1,bad order,i order a new 14 speed oster blender from literrallyamazing an they sent me a use on unto now i cant get back one because i mention i am from the caribbean that make the seller happy i am not there to get ma claim i couldn't use that old thing with plenty marksi will not order no used item
2,Great concept but rips easily,"Ripped in half as soon as I tightened it around my Dewalt drill. I didn't even pull very hard, just enough for it not to come loose. The rubber is poor quality."
5,THE style,"This is the pinnacle of Techno/rave. My senior year when this albumn came out, i was the only person in my school who even knew what techno was. This was a period when 2unlimited's ""get ready for this"" and c&c music factory was the mainstream's idea of techno. all that was pure garbage compared to the raw sounds produced by LA style. Even compared to the regurgitated ... that comes out of the music industry these days, this albumn is like stealing a halo and putting it in your cd player! If you don't own this cd, do yourself a favor and educate yourself in the fine art of music history."
2,boo.,It crashes constantly and I got so bored and frustrated with it that I stopped playing before winning.
2,"yay, another [bad] game.","so yeah, some of my friends were talking about how fantastic this game is, so I got it. apparently my friends are not very smart or they are pathalogical liars. basically, my main beef with the game is, if you're god -- why all the rules and restrictions? people tell YOU what to do, not the other way around. you have a little god and a little devil guy telling you what to do all the time and you have to feed and maintain what amounts to a really stupid pet. your villagers have no idea how to build anything, you have to do all of that yourself. it's basically just a strategy game where you have to defeat rival ""gods"" and listen to 2 stupid cartoon characters tell you what to do all the time."
4,"Great Game, but the Mac is not a Game Console","This is a fun game. The graphics are beautiful and the play is mostly good. It is very difficult to get some of the gestures down, and while it's cute to have a game where you cast spells by drawing patterns in the air with your mouse, getting them done is really fussy. It would be better to just press a key.The only extremely annoying thing about the game is that it completely takes over your system. You cannot switch out of it to read mail, check messages, look at a web site, and so on. You have to completely quit the game. This is especially annoying as it takes close to a full minute for it to start up (it has to show you all the animated logos for all the people who worked on it, even the ones who polished the CD), but it takes 30 seconds or more for the darned thing to quit. So while it's is a great time and very amusing, it was done by people who've obviously never heard of the Internet. I docked it a full star for that."
3,Serves Its Purpose,I needed a better organizer for my scale model bench. I had tried building my own. I am a model builder not a carpenter...unfortunately. I saw this on Amazon and really liked the simplicity.PROS: Looks good and has drastically cut down the clutter on my bench.CONS: Packaging and material. USPS dropped kicked the box and then had a UFC match with the it! I ended up glueing four pieces back together. The wood is almost a balsa quality type wood. Very soft. I had expected a harder wood for the price.Overall: I am happy with it but felt that for price they could of packaged it better and made it out of a sturdier would.
4,not bad...,"At first I was disappointed when I got it but once I tried it on I wasn't anymore. The quality of the product is bit low, but it does look good on! I'd say it is quite good for the price, after all it is pretty inexpensive, and it's not that you are going to be wearing it for a long time... ;)"
2,Did nothing for this straight woman,"I must agree with the reviewer who stated that this book had a gay tilt to it. That's perfectly fine if that's your cup of tea, and I'm glad that gay men have books such as these to choose from. I prefer something with just photos of nude men by themselves. I guess I'll continue my search for such a book. I'm disappointed that there is so little out there for heterosexual women like me."
2,Not what I expected,"How could it not be, right? It's called 'Male Nude'. Well there are many nude men within its pages, but nothing I found spectacular or new in approach. It seemed this book was done with a gay tilt to it as well, which is fine if that's what one is looking for. Several of the images are of men together, hugging, admiring, etc. I hoped for more nudes on their own, instead of images provoking what happened before or what will happen after the photo was taken. Regardless, there are some nice physiques here, and the book is laid out in chronological order from the 1900s up to present day. The past pictures were intersting to see, but this isn't something I keep precious in my collection."
5,Hell yes!,"I read this book when I was in middle school. It was one of the many reasons that I joined the Marines. It was written back in the day when men were men and weren't afraid to be just that. I am trying to give my son, and daughter, the same mentality. Perhaps that is why they are BOTH good defensive ends. ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! Thank goodness that my parents kept my library intact after I enlisted! My boy has already read it at 14 years old, the girl is next at twelve. There is still pride and honor in this country, it is just becoming a little bit more difficult to see.Regards,Sgt. VanderHorst"
5,An incredibly moving story!,"This book was the most moving book I have ever read. He was the first and only man to survive being inside a thunderstorm, and he is still alive and well right now. Every time I see a thunderhead of a storm cloud, I think of this book, and how this man could suffer through all of that and still stay alive. I am a 13 year old girl, and reading this book could be the most inspiring expeirience ever. It is an easy book to understand, but fit for all ages. I encourage anyone who loves a good story to read ""The Man Who Rode The Thunder""."
4,Funny Book For Being Instructive,"Knowing next to nothing about Photoshop Elements, this book really helped. The humor throughout the book was great because it wasn't just another mind-numbing technical manual that goes from introductory to a Ph.D. level of understanding by the third chapter.The use of humor throughout the book made it fun to read. It's one of the few ""computer/software"" books I've read front to back.But along with the humor, is a lot of good instruction and information about using Photoshop Elements."
3,Not quite what one might hope for,Here is what you get with this disk: (1) a collection of movie trailers and news clips about Monroe's life; (2) a collection of 24 audio only tracks of her singing in her films; and (3) a collection of posters for her films. What you do not get are actual visual clips of her singing in the films (save those excerpts included in the trailers).
1,beware,I would like to know what Matt Monro (if him) has to do with this DVD. Thank youGiuliano Fournier
3,Chandelier earrings,"These earrings were ok. They are cute, but look very cheap. The picture gives you the impression that they look better than they actually do."
5,Quick and easy cookies with WOW factor!,"This is a great stencil for wafer cookies once you figure out how to use it. The included recipe was easy to whip up, and the cookies were made quickly and taste great! They have lots of WOW factor too. I did not use the greased and floured pan, but used parchment instead. Not a stuck or broken cookie in the bunch, and they slide right off the parchment."
2,"Sorry, but not worth $20.","Ms. Offen's explanation of the lack of editing notwithstanding, this story leaves much to be desired. Nothing really made me care that much about the main characters. The fact that it is the author's first novel should not be accepted as an excuse for a thin plotline and poor character development. There are many, many first-time novelists who produce wonderful, rich and imaginative stories! When I finished reading, I basically felt, ""so what?""...I'm sorry now that I purchased the sequel before reading the first book."
2,Needs more work,"The plot line simple and at times choppy.Girl in small town.Girl has problems.Nice foriegn vamp (Got to have that french accent) hears her call and comes to the rescue.In addition the character development leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a nice story if at times a bit hokey (yes I needed to use that word to describe it). I wouldn't recommend it but if you have some spare time, check it out at your local library before commiting to own it."
2,Not Well Written,"I have read hundreds of paranormal romances and this one just does not have it at all. Besides the numerous spelling errors, the story line is trite, the character development weak and the conversation inane and unbelieveable. The idea isn't bad but the story development is amaturish and the contact between the two is like child and mentor rather than lover. None of the love scenes were believeable in even a remote manner. They seem to have been taken from other stories so therefore lacked power. It cost way too much for the lack of worthy story. If you want to give Offen a try, borrow the book from someone or the library. Don't waste your money. I purchased this and the second in the series which I am not going to read. I'll give it to the half price book store and let someone else suffer through the stories."
1,I want my money back!,So basically I thought this would be a good book and it deffinitly wasn't. I honestly want my money back but i don't want to sell it to some one else since it is such a terrible book. I didn't even finish the book but i'm sure the ending wasn't going to make the book better. I would recomend that no one read this book because its just dumbMaggie
1,Dont Waste Your Time,Very poor quality VHS transfer - not remastered at all. Pixelated and spanish sub-titles over the text. This is the SILENT FILM Version! It does not say that in the description.
1,Inaccurate strength rating in description,"I ended up returning this tow strap because the strength rating in the description is inaccurate. The description says it's rated at 20,000 lbs, but the rating on the strap itself is 12,000 lbs."
5,Del Junco scores with Northernblues Music!,"Harpist Carlos del Junco accentuates carefully placed golden melodies and lounge-tenor vocals that will give his southern American bandleader counterparts a listening ear. As a harmonica player, del Junco has a wonderful understanding of traditional music styles. His knowledge of Latin rhythms and percussion leads to abrupt stops and key changes mid-tune, and he has been known to ""split"" his harmonica at times during solos. Kevin Breit, the album's bottleneck and guitar player, shines on this record with dirty and drunken bottleneck rhythms. Breit fills the dozen tracks with whiskey fuzz and hammer-down tube-amp drawls that mimic none other than Lightnin' Hopkins himself; with de-tuned low strings and lollygagging slide. This record is recommended for fans of Rod Piazza, and the James Harman Band. - Brett Lemke - (...)"
5,harp master,the confidence and versatility of his playing will at first make you want to throw all your harps out the window and try piano instead. he's so amazingly good it'll make you smile.
4,"Quality, but stains your feet","These are without a doubt comfortable, long-lasting sandals, but the light brown pair I bought stains the bottoms of my feet after I walk through any kind of water in them."
5,Best pastoral noise ambient band today,"""The Cycle of Days and Seasons"" takes their sound another step (toward quiet pained introspection) beyond the previous ""Rustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys."" Hood is a marvelous band of several disguises (their earlier albums -- ""Cabled Linear Traction"" and ""Silent '88"" are more in the Pavement vein, but even better), and now they're resurrecting and tweaking the Bark Psychosis and Labradford brilliance. Their lyrics, when audible, are also quite worthwhile, a rarity these days. Seek this out."
5,still LRB to me,full circle was and is one of the most heart warming performances by the real LRB.....aged yes...but still great artists.i would recommend this to all people who like LRB or BSG.... what a delight to see. I sure wish they would still tour the usa one more time!!!!!!!!!!
5,BEST heating pad around,I LOVE this heating pad. I decided to get a new heating pad and picked this one after reading the reviews. I am SO glad I did. It is large and heavy so it doesn't slide. This heating pad is what a heating pad was meant to be. It is better than any heating pad I have owned. My Mom came over and I let her use it. Now I have to buy a new one. She decided the one I had was her early Christmas present. =D
5,Excellent Product,I had researched a few brands of heating pads before buying this one. What finalized my decision was finding out that it is the one that is recommended by the Physical Therapy clinic where our son works. All of us are very impressed.
5,thermapad,I love this pad! It has a timer as well as a temperature setting built in. I can take it to 120 degrees for 5 minutes then reset it to lower tempature for a longer time. I do get a great deal of pain relief with this pad.
5,Moist Heating Pad,I love this heating pad. Well worth the money. It has some weight to it that you cannot find in heating pads sold in department stores. It feels more like the heating pads used in physical therapy sessions
4,Thank you TheraTherm!,"I was in intense pain and desperate for relief, so I was very pleased the pad arrived so quickly.As for the heating pad~it is awesome and my shoulders are delighted! The size is generous and the pad is heavy so it stays put! The only drawback is the temperature. The heat roars in and then after 10-15 minutes will cool down, then the cycle begins again. Personally, I prefer the temp to stay constant.All in all, it's a wonderful product and I'll never part with mine.Thank you for being ""Thera"" Therm! (LOL!)"
5,Perfect for my needs,This heating pad has been a true help for my back. I use it at night for about 30 minutes. It lays flat and doesn't bunch up like so many other pads. It heats up quickly. I recommend it whole-heartedly.
2,Works great and then gets cold quickly,"I wanted to love this heating pad, because when it is working and all heated up it is fantastic, but then it cools off. I find that I have to constantly play with the controls because it stays hot for a few minutes and then cools down, so then you have to fiddle with the controls again. I wish I had listened to the other reviews that had this complaint before purchasing, now I have to go through the hassle of returning..."
1,Reliability or lack thereof,I received this three weeks ago and have used it three times. It's now dead. I'm planning to send it back in when I have spare time.
3,"Moist Heating Pads - TheraTherm - Digital - Rectangular Blanket - 14"" x 27""","I purchased this item for a gift and was very disappointed when I received it in just a plastic wrapper and not in the original box, as shown in the product description. My daughter-in-law said that was ok and she loves the blanket but I was extremely upset with the shoddy packaging and misleading picture attached."
3,Its ok power switch is weird,- power button is not always consistent- i bought this for a shoulder rehab. It was hard to wrap the pad around my shoulder and have it stay in place because the Velcro was not placed well for this purpose
5,heating pad,Excellent service and product is exactly what I wanted. Would be a repeat customer should the need arise at a future time.
5,Help is on its way.,"My doctor recommended I use moist heat for my back problems as the conventional heating pads dry out your muscles and aid to the problem instead of helping it. This is a wonderful heating pad, heavy weight and very soothing. Highly recommend!"
4,TheraTherm Heating Pad,Very flexible and easy to use. Size is large enough to cover entire back at once. Heat can be set from warm to scorch. Very pleased with purchase
3,"Best HP you'll use, BUT 1 Major design flaw","Function is wonderful, best heating pad ever. Moist heat = hot tub feeling. First, this will not break on you as long as you follow the golden rule: Never fold it and lay on it with all your weight. It CLEARLY tells you this i the OM. Secondly, the main reason i gave ut a 3 star rating, was because it doesnt glow or illuminate. I cant believe it doesnt, because it so f-ing perfect in every other way. Look for this brand BUT one tbat will allow you to see it without having to tourn on a light. I us a nearby cell phone as flashlight and it really pisse me off."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this pad for $69 from amazon on December 18 2010 and we use it often. However today, (17 months later) its totally burned out. Maybe that's a good amount of time but for almost $70 I would expect more longevity."
1,Thermostat does not work,"This heating pad would be the most incredible thing I have purchased for my aching back, except that despite my reading the directions four times and following them exactly, the heating pad keeps getting hotter and hotter, ignoring the temperature it has been set at, to the point of almost cooking my flesh, leaving it bright red. With deep regret, and wishing the thermostat worked, I am returning this item."
2,Love/Hate,"I loved this heating pad due to its ability to provide a high temp moist heat and it is constructed so that it has a nice weight to it. What I didn't like about it was that the switch went out on it after about a year. I was able to fix it, temporarily, but ended up having to throw it out. I bought another one with a thermostat of the same brand and it was wonderful...until it wasn't. It only lasted about a year also. I use a heating pad about once a week, on average, so, for the price, I feel they should last longer. I am in the process of purchasing another one, but I am going with a different brand."
2,Stopped working after a few uses,"I bought a moist heating pad from Theratherm less than 5 months ago ( July 14, 2010). When I wanted to use it again last month (November, 2010) after having used it only a couple of times, it stopped working. I bought another heating pad from Thermophore around the same time (July 2, 2010), and this is still working fine even though I use it almost every day. I would hesitate to buy another heating pad from Theratherm."
1,Been through 2 - Faulty - Shorts Out,"At first I loved this heating pad because it just seems so well made..heavy...comfortable...smart thermostat...etc. Well, after going through 2 and having the same thing happen (faulty wiring causing short in controls) I'm back to using a really REALLY old heating pad that I hate - but at least it is reliable and functions."
1,Bad Design,"Temperature spikes way above the setting, making you have to turn it back down, no light on controls, finally after about year and half, temperature quit, timer still works. no warranty after 1 year. Buy 10.00 heating pad & after 5 years they still work. Save your money."
4,Good goods,My wife uses this pad and loves it. It meets and exceeds it's billing.Recommend strongly.
4,Not as hot as a thermaphore,"I have a rectangular Thermophore which I like very much, but it's hard to get it around the neck and shoulder. This heating pad with the neck cut out is a great idea and works pretty well. It doesn't get as hot as the Thermaphore. The max temperature is 166*. It's usually warm enough. I liked it enough to keep it."
3,A Decently Priced and Effective Moist Heating Pad,"I wanted a moist heating pad that was like the one I used many years ago and lasted for years. Though this may be among the best in the market place, it doesn't fulfill my needs and was returned. The reason is that the instructions state that you can't lay on it and if you do, it won't be able to generate the moisture needed (which is by chemical means). If I was able to lay on my stomach, I feel certain that this unit would be able to provide me with the comfort and relief I need. I since have learned that most, if not all, heating pads warn against laying on them for fear of the user falling asleep. If there isn't a timed automatic cut-off, it could result in severe burns, especially if the heating pad remains on a high setting for an extended period. That seems to be a liability issue that has little to do with laying on most heating pads."
3,the moist blanket,"My mother was having low back pain. We tried the microwaveable heat pads, our old heating pads (that was 20 years old) and pain killers. On the recommendation of a friend I purchased the moist heating pad.From order to door it took us 4 days for the item to get here. The instructions were not complex and it took my mother about 5 minutes to read and understand it. It works as advertised and my mother's low back is sufficiently abated that she uses it infrequently (about once a week).So it really works as advertised. It may be a bit pricey but highly recommended."
3,Not Bad,"Heating pad does most of what I thought it was suppose to and does lay on shoulders just fine. However I purchased mine to get some heat on my neck also, this will not do it. Need one with a bit of a collar to do neck and shoulders."
5,Love this product - replacement for wornout one,this is great because makes own moisture and can set temperature especially good product for someone who requires a product of this nature. recommended by my physician and medical equipment company
5,very good,"one of the best heat pads . it workes great . and you have to love the temp controle . if you like it very hot as i do , this s the thing u neeed to buy"
4,Works Better Than Expected,"Purchased the TheraTherm. The first one did not work and came without packaging. I wrote to Amazon and I received a new pad in about three days! Fantastic customer service.The pad really penetrates well. We have tried all sorts of cheaper brands but this moist heat concept is the answer for us. We love being able to program the temperature and the timing of the pad. Our only slight complaint is that the control readout cannot be seen in the dark. So, you have to turn on a light to adjust. This is a bit annoying and keeps it from being a perfect product. The button for turning it on is easy enough to find, however.Other than that, we are happy with both the service and the product."
1,"Please don't buy this, it won't last more than a month before it shorts out!","When it worked it was a pretty good product. I bought 3 of them and they all broke within a month. I thought the first was a fluke, until the second and third all shorted out. They no longer get warm, I tried to fix the most recent one, however, it will not work. I am now buying another brand and hope it isn't made by the same manufacturer! While I surf for a new heating pad I am using my reliable 10 dollar CVS product, what a shame."
5,Best heating pad ever!,"This heating pad acts more like a hydrocolator than a traditional heating pad. It is well made, larger than other pads, and has an excellent control that allows you to set the time and temperature. I recommend it highly!"
1,High price - short life - poor value.,High price for a heating pad that lasted 18 months.The thermostat would fluctuate temperature between cold and very hot even when new.One day it just stopped - digital display still worked but no heat.
1,Moist Heating Pad,Product does not function as described. Does heat but does not emit moisture no matter how long it is set.
2,Stopped working 15 months later,"I did my research on heating pads and this pad was ranked very highly and had great reviews. I was trying to use up my FSA money before year-end and chose to spend the money on a good quality pad. I would use this pad at night time, placing it under my upper back. It worked great and I liked the auto shut-off feature (although i wish it maxed out at 120 min instead of 60). I didn't one it all the time either, probably 50 times throughout 15 months. Last week, I tried to turn it on and it crapped out on me! There was no damage to the cord, the pad, the remote - it just stopped working! I called the manufacturer and they have a strict 1 year warranty policy. So now I'm SOL. I guess I'll just buy a sunbeam from CVS. At least then when it craps out after a year, I won't feel as bad having bought a cheaper product.To sum up: It was nice while it lasted!"
1,How Long will the thermostat hold up?,The thermostat shows signs of loss already. Buzzer sounds longer when plugged in and 'ON' button is slower to activate. I am concerned that this is a sign that there will be more problems soon. Another concern is that the pad doesn't hold its heat for the entire time set. I have to 'UP' the temperature in order to get heat again. I have not had it for very long.
1,Not Exactly User Friendly...,"While there aren't a lot of controls on this device, they are not labelled very nor do they work in an intuitive manner at least not to me. The main problem I have is that when I try to increase the temperature during a session the heating seems to stop. If I had spent more on this device I would have returned it."
1,stopped working after 4 months,"I bought it in May and it stopped working a month ago: two small wires inside the pad were rubbing against the lead(!) strips and they broke. The pad works well just don't bend it much. the internal wiring needs to be beefed up a bit. Started using my old one from Rite Aid that I've had for years, it cost $20.00"
5,Shoulder/Neck heating pad,"Have had this product for about 5 months and it is great! This past week I had to do some roof repair using a ladder, and on the roof itself. Needless to say, at the end of the day my neck, shoulders, and upper back hurt really bad. Used this, set timer and temp and the pain went away, disconnected and took off the heating pad and I got a good nights sleep. Highly recommend this product!!!!!!"
4,TgeraTherm Shoulder Heating Pad,"This is a very uinque product which has no equal competitors. It is a bit quirky to get used to using it properly as upon initial heat-up it has a temperature over run past the set temperature of over 9 degrees F. Once it is in a steady state the temperature over runs stabilize at around 4 degrees F. You have to be very carefull to set the temperature at a setting which will not result in burning your skin during the initial temperature over run or, as a precaution, do not place it on your shoulders until the temperature has stabilized according to the digital readout."
4,TheraTherm Digital Pad,"The pad really does a terrific job of heating up and holding set temperatures; however, I'm not thrilled with the fact that I'm not supposed to lean back into the pad. I don't understand this stipulation at all although I am abiding by it. When the pad is in use, I'm either sitting up (in a forward leaning position) or lying down with it on top of my back. So far so good and I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing slight tenderness in their back or to help alleviate simple back soreness."
1,Came without packaging or instructions! Previously returned or used???,Product came without the factory box and missing instructions. Wrapped in flimsey cellophane and tissue paper--seemed like a previously returned or used item!?!? Returned immediately!! VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH VENDOR AND AMAZAON!!!
1,Promised but not delivered!,"Very disappointing! The description of this item said specifically that it was the Brand Name of TheraTherm. I've tried a few and this is the best quality brand. When you're talking about heat on a timer I need to feel confident in the quality of the product that it will shut off with timer. Big surprise when I opened the box and did not find the TheraTherm Brand but a very poor quality GJO Global brand. Anyone ever heard of them? Very poor quality and controls made so cheap I can't trust the timer.I purchased this moist heating pad through Amazon and was surprised that Amazon allows this type of deceptive advertising. Doesn't help me to trust ordering from Amazon with this deceptiveness. Like to get what I pay for and what I order.Moist Heating Pads - TheraTherm - Digital - Rectangular Blanket - 14"" x 27"
5,Can't live without it!,"I have a chronic back problem and after being out and doing errands I look so forward to coming home and lying on this wonderful heating pad! Went with my husband for a 5 day vacation and of course the heating pad came along! I've had it for quite a while now and it's still working great! If you suffer from any kind of arthritis or other painful disorders, this heating pad is for you! It really does work with the humidity in the air. Love it!"
2,Heating fast but..,"It heat up fast but the shape doesn't really attach to my skin while I sit. Therefore heat is not evenly transferred. I'm a 5' 5"" 115 lbs so may be its too big for me."
5,Loved it,"My Physical Therapist uses this item. I loved it there and so I bought one for myself. I love the way you can set the time, temperature. It provides moist heat with out the wet clothes. I use it a lot. The strap comes in handy . Buying online saved me some money. It arrived quickly and in great condition."
1,Used one time before it shorted out,"Upon first glance this heating pad appears to be sturdy and well made. I thought it would work really well. Not so. I bought it for neck and upper shoulder pain and the pad did not sit properly to heat those areas. I put it back in the box and one week later took it back out to use. This time, it would not heat up at all. The controls would not operate,I followed closely all the directions but all I could get out of it was a high pitch squeal. I boxed it up and sent it back. This item is definately not worth the high price. I do compliment Amazon on their return process. There was no additional cost to me for shipping and the credit was applied within days."
4,great product,I like the theratherm digital heating pad. You can set the timer for 1 - 60min and you can adjust the temperature setting. These two functions make me feel confident when I recommend it to my clients.
1,FAKE!!,"I've worn Ferre since the 90's and loved it. My wife loved it, everyone loved it. Only one problem....THIS IS NOT FERRE!!It smells exactly like one of those ""imposter"" fragrances, only worse. (like Paco Rabanne & cat pee)The bottle and packaging look right just not the contents.Perhaps Gianfranco Ferre licensed his brand to an unscrupulous fragrance manufacturer and changed the formulation to cheaper ingredients? In any event, save your money...unless you really like overpriced Aqua Velva."
2,Broke quickly,"It was working great when brand new. However, after two years of occasional use it would not hold in the up position any more. It would go up when you pump it and then slowly go down on its own. Stay away."
4,SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS,"My grandsons love these cartoons. They are what cartoons used to be, funny and silly!"
3,Megan's Wings,"Megan's Promise is an enjoyable and inspirational novel that allows a glimpse in the life of Megan LaBianca. Megan, a young Italian-American woman raised in Chicago, struggles with her identity, as she comes to terms with what she wants in life, and the life that her controlling mother demands of her. Her mother, an unhappy woman, constantly puts down Megan's choices and friends. She cannot understand why Megan will not marry the man she selected for her at birth. Her mother becomes infuriated when Megan chooses to travel to California to take part in her best friend's wedding, where she also experiences a spiritual and self awakening. A family crisis allows Megan to discover some surpising truths about her mother and her deceased father, and finally she feels the freedom to live her own life."
4,A wonderful new yoga,"This book is written such that someone with only a smattering of yoga background can understand the postures, but would be a bit confusing to someone with no background at all. Some of the poses are easy and provide immediate beneficial effects. Others are more difficult and bring a sense of accomplishment when they are finally attained. However, some yield almost no relief or are too difficult to attain without sufficient strength. The postures are all pictured individually with tips and instructions which are usually easy to follow and are grouped into levels of increasing difficulty. There are also suggested flows and tools for partners to develop their own. Overall, this book can guide beginners into developing greater flexibility and trust as well as suggest more difficult movements when partners are ready to advance."
3,ok,The content was just ok and the pictures quality was below sub par. I would not recommend anyone buy this book. This is the 4th partner yoga book I have bought from amazon and use it the least.
5,Good stuff,Stuff works pretty good. I even sprayed it on old stains and they came out. And so did the odor
5,I love this stuff!,This is the best carpet spot cleaner It's quick-easy and it WORKS!If you have pets you need this spot cleaner. I wish I would have found this many puppies ago!
5,Equalizer Carpet Stain & Oder Eliminator,I really like the product with having multiple pets and knowing an accident can always happpen
4,fast acting,I would definately reccoment this product. It worked faster than I ever thought and as long as you air out the room after you will see results right away and also not be choked up or have a stuffed nose after.
3,Read the Fine Print,"Most reviewers rate this product with 5 stars, which is why I purchased it. Unfortunately, I can't use it on the carpet with the pet issue, because it is not recommended for Berber or wool. This is not indicated in the product description, but if you view the larger image with the tiny print on the side of the can, it is there."
2,Doesn't work....disappointed.,"I was really surprised at the poor performance of this product after reading all the rave reviews. It probably removes about 50% of the stain. I have bought grocery store products (Woolite Pet) that work better than this. Also, the can looks huge but because it's aerosol it runs out very quickly. I would not purchase this product again."
5,Carpet Cleaner,It is by far the best carpet cleaner for pet stains on the market and we have tried them all. It makes pet stains disappear.
3,Overpriced and overhyped,"This stuff works no better than the Bissell OxyPro Pet you can buy for less than 1/2 the price. Does the exact same thing, works the exact same way...might as well be the same product.I purchased this product simply by the reviews and figured I was going to get something better than the OxyPro - I ended up just feeling like I wasted my money."
2,Didn't work for me,I can still smell the Urine after using a whole can on an area about 3x3'I'm not sure If the cats are still urinating in the area. Now it just smells like Urine and Chemicals.
2,Scratched,"I love this album, and that's why I was sad that it was scratched and only three of the songs played. :("
3,All-Out War,"""A Killing Frost"" is the third book of the Tomorrow Series.The narrative takes a deeper and more audacious focus towards guerilla warfare. Through this experience the characters develop enhanced emotionless towards the war and their occupiers.Unlike the previous books the skirmishes that take place in this part of the series are less believable.One of the most compelling aspects of this stage of the story is that Ellie, in particular, develops colder numbness when taking enemy lives and at the sight of death around her.The next phase of each characters journey remains intriguing and so the need to keep reading is well ignited.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
1,what the holy @##%,I am so confuse why the cheapest price for this book for 20 bucks? while the rest are like under 10 dollars. what makes this book so special? release the books and make it cheaper.
3,Spelling and along of errors,It's a good book but I have noticed that words are misspelled and some don't make sense so you kind of have to interpret some. His y is v and so forth
5,A great series,I thought this was an excellent book. John Marsden uses a unique way to describe his characters. I was especially shocked by the ending. I love the whole series and I can't wait to get more of his books.
5,Teenagers are put into the highest respect by Marsden,"A Killer Frost is definitely one of the best books i have read and is the most exciting, suspenseful survival story i have ever read. The respect Marsden gives to these teenagers is amazing! This is definitely the best book in the series that i have read."
5,The Tomorrow Series #3,"This is the third book in the Tomorrow Series by John Marsden. It's a great series. However, you'd want to begin by reading number one so that you can enjoy all of the adventure and character development."
1,WARNING - THIS IS NOT THE POP-PUNK BAND FROM NY,"Who wuddah thought that two bands would name themselves a name like that, but this record (outside line) is not a cd by the same band that recorded OUT OF THE LOOP and SATURDAY IN VAIN. Dont get confused! This band is from Portland OR (yea!) and play country fried something or other... BC- I think its time to call the lawyers!"
5,Artforms by Preble and Preble,This is an exciting excellent book in the area of art and the forms that art is inpacted by. The illustrations to this book are exciting and colors are radiant.
4,Just as promised,Arrived timely. Condition was just as advertised. It got me through my class perfectly.
5,Fantastic read! One of her best.,"As usual, when I saw a new Bertrice Small book on the shelf, I had to have it immediately. I enjoy her ""history lessons"" as well as the fantasies. I can't wait for the next book!"
5,One of my all time faves!!!,"This book is to die for!!! I loved it! could not put it down, read it in a day. I had purchased it about 6 months ago and it had been sitting on my book shelf until I had this all of a sudden overwhelming urge to read a bertrice. Let me tell you what....this is one hot, exciting book. I was so engrossed in it that I did not want it to end. I almost turned right back to the first page after finishing it. Even though totally different, Zaynab has become one of my favorite heroines. I bawled while reading this book and will never forget how I loved it and how I felt while reading it."
5,"A ""must have"" B. Small book","Apart from the O'Malley series, this is one of Bertrice Small's better works. This books does not only tell about love and loyalty, but also accepting one's fate and chosing happiness in life. The plot was intriguing and exciting. This is one book that any fan of Ms Small's work should have for keeps and read, and re-read."
1,"Book should be marketed under EROTICA, not ROMANCE","This is the first Ms Bertrice's book I ever read and still don't Know what to make of it. The two main characters, Zaynab and Karim, fell in lust at first sight. Although the author tries to justify their ""love,"" I still can't believe that a relationship can be based on sex only. Zaynab also comes across as a pompous, pretentious person who needs to justify her actions to the reader. If she believes her actions are necessary for her survival, they need not be justified."
1,kiddie porn,"I am sort of appalled that so many readers would rate this book so high. 5 stars for a story of a young girl (yes, girl) and a 28 year old man than a 50 year old man who use her sexually? The fact that so many find it ""erotic"" that a man would insert silver balls, use dildos rectally on a (age range in this story) 13-15 year old girl is sort of creepy. This is Ms. Small's idea of romance? Regan, a young Scottish lass, is sent to a convent at 13. Instead, she is sold as a slave to be tutored as a love slave for a Moor. Regan's twin sister, Gruoch, is to be married to a family enemy but is pregnant at the time of her wedding. Regan takes her place in the marriage bed so all would assume Gruoch was a virgin like Regan. When the wedding Regan is sent to this convent. Anyway, the story would have worked far better had Regan actually stayed at the convent for a few years than be sold. Again, the age of Regan is really crude."
5,Very good book.,"I must admit that I didn't like this book so much for the romance (don't get me wrong, there's romance) as I did for the SIZZLING love scenes. Boy, I thought I was in a sauna! BEWARE, this book is not for the faint hearted. There are some serious sex scenes in this book."
3,"It's All right, I guess.","I felt sorry for Regan in the beginning, being shoved aside by her mother as a baby and being forced to lie with a man who smelled of horses in her twin sister's place. Later, Regan was to be sold into slavery by the people who ran the nunnery, but not before being raped buy the man who ripped her clothes off. Regan does get what she desires in the end, but only after she is forced to leave the palace, because of a jealous first wife who poisons her twice, with her daughter, who conveniently dies of an outbreak of spotted fever on one of the visits to her father. This was an obvious ""easy out"" that infuriated me because it only received four lines in the book. Okay, it isn't wise to have a daughter in tow when you want to return to the one you love, (obvious plot hole!) but she didn't have to die like that. There would have been someone to care for her with all those women around."
2,Really dissappointed,"When I read the reviews I thought I was gonna read about a hot hot romance between Zainab and Karim....Unfortunately this book was not a romance. It focussed entirely on the heroine. Karim was there only in the begining of the book and then towards the end of it. While the love scenes were quite ok, most of them were with Zainab and other guys, which I didn't appreciate. In fact I was quite happy when I finished the book and stared reading The Lady's Tutor by Robin Schone....Now that is what I call an erotic romance.After reading The Love Slave, I have not bought anything by Ms Small as I feel she she dosen't write an erotic romance centred on the H&H; (which I like), she writes more about the sexual experiences of the heroine and focusses only on her(which I absolutely do not like)!"
4,Very attractive but somewhat uncomfortable,"If you buy a pair of these, you might want to buy a wide width or a half-size larger than usual. They fit me comfortably everywhere except across the top where my foot is the widest. The heel is very nice and easy to walk in. The colors are very attractive. The price, while much higher than what I normally pay for shoes, is comparable to similar shoes in department stores. Overall I consider this a very nice, high-quality pair of shoes."
3,Mitsou's only US release,"Mitsou tried to make her mark in the US in 1992 and began by releasing this album of collected material from her first two album. Helmed by the singles 'Deep Kiss' and 'Heading West', it also features 'Mercedes Benz' (a Janis Joplin cover) and other pop hits like 'Dis-moi, dis-moi' and 'Lettre à un cowboy'. An interesting but incomplete album."
1,"Watch Out for ""Smart Toe""","Okay - My second toe is NOT longer than my big toe, but somehow these shoes made it look longer - very unattractive!! They were immediately returned (at a cost to me I might add)."
1,Much cheaper if you can go to Costco or Sam's Club,You can get a 15-pack of these bars for $14 at Sams Club. That's about half as much as they charge here. So if you already pay for a membership to one of those clubs I recommend going there instead.
1,This flat out sucks!!,"It's horrible!! Don't know what happened to this band 'cause their first release rocked! THe music is decent enough but the juvenile, pre-teen sex filled lyrics kill this release. And don't get me started on the Train song...WTF??? Bypass this one!"

2,Not so good if you are using it out of the US,"I bought this a couple of days ago as Amazon was having a pretty good price-sale on it.First of all, its heavy... yep, a real beast with good build quality.They were not stinting on the metal when they made this baby!My problems started when I took it back to Europe, just in time I noticed that its only 110v so it cant really be used in Europe without a converter.As its rated at 600 watts these ""step converters"" are pretty expensive - more than the price of this thing!Nearly everything electronic that I have purchased for the past few years have been 110v - 220v, so the only thing I can think of as to why this was not 110v-220v is that Grizzly stinted on one damn part.It's wayyyy to heavy to post it back and way to expensive to get a converter... so its going to be a heavy paperweight :(Wrote to Grizzly and days later not a peep - they customer support/pre-sales departments suck."
2,"Nice Interview, Few Photographs","This book starts with an interview with Weber that provides some insight into his philosophy and point of view as a photographer. That though is about the best part of the book, I wish it had been longer actually. It seems like they just filled out the remaining pages with outtakes from shoots. Only one or two of the prints seem to really capture the photographer the initial interview sets up. If you are a Bruce Weber fan, this book is only worth buying for a few bucks used, to get a sense of his process. Otherwise if you want to enjoy his work you're betting off spending your money on one of the several books he has published himself.Branded Youth: and Other Storiesis a great one."
2,Results run 10 to 15 % Higher,I switched to this product from The Ultra One Touch and my results jumped almost 15 points. I adjusted my medication to bring it down to within normal limits. After 1 week I ran the Ultra One Touch and results were to low. I adjusted my medicine and went back to the One Touch. I even ran the positive control and everything tested fine. I'm not sure the product is accurate.
1,Not What was Advertized,"This is advertized as a kit, which contains a meter as well as other materials needed to get started. It is not. What arrived was just the meter and a handy carrying pouch which can hold all the things you will need: strips, lancet and replacement lancets. Instead of checking my blood sugar, I am back on line ordering more paraphernalia."
1,Wrong product features,"I was sorely disappointed on receiving the package which does not include the 50 count test strip box or the 102 lancelets as given in the product description. It was totally misleading. Secondly, it is nowhere mentioned that you also need the control solution in order to start using the whole thing. I was planning to give it to my parents who are leaving the country shortly. Now I don't have sufficient time to purchase the other items. Besides, I am not sure if I want to spend at least another $50 to make the kit useable. A total waste of money for me."
1,Millionaire Dees Writes Another Fundraising Screed,"I revisited this book after noting Dees' Southern Poverty Law Center's continuing miserably low rating with charity watchdog The American Institute of Philanthropy. Fifteen years ago, Dees promised to stop fundarising at $55 million, only to raise that to $100 million two years later. Now he has $120 million and spends $6 million per year on fundraising and only half that much on helping victims of civil rights violations. I can't find a single figure, let alone a detailed financial report, on the SPLC web site. But he did build himself a massive stainless steel office building in Montgomery.Race-baiting and scare-mongering pays very well, at least for Moe."
1,Hate for sale... worthless book..,"If you want to read a book filled with hate speech, and constant innuendo, one that is short on facts, but long on meandering lectures that try to paint a picture that is just not there this might be the book for you.. nothing in the book dovetails with anything the FBI analysis has shown to be the current state of militia's.. in fact the numbers from the FBI, when compared to what is painted in this book are almost direct and complete opposites..If you want a creative colorful fantasy, this is the book for you, if you want truth and facts look else where.. this book is a huge waste of money and time..Save your money, go read the FBI reports they are online, and they are free, and they are not a waste of your time and money like this book is...wish I could get my money back, I feel like I was ripped off.."
1,Hate literature littered with inaccuracies,"This book should classified as Hate Literature. I've followed Morris Dees and he is one of the most hateful people, cowering under the umbrella of ""liberalism"".This book is over a decade old and none of the fear-mongering he promoted in this book has come to light.Now that we have a new enemy, and to prove Dees doesn't just hate white Christians (which is very obvious), I would like him to write a companion book, or amend this one with our new threat, Radical Islam, who pose a real and valid fear within America.For some reason, I don't think he will."
3,Two baskets,I ordered two of these baskets to give as a thank you. To my surprise the contents of the baskets differ from one another. Some items were not in it as well.
1,Nasty,"The caviar was so fishy, salty, and nasty. Couldn't eat the salmon dill stuff or most of the other stuff in this basket. Paid to get by Christmas and got it 2 days after. I won't be buying another one of these. Total disappointment!! Yuck!!!"
5,Great gift for the money,"My brother and sister in law said the contents were fun and delicious. Great gift for the money, and with people dropping by for New Years, I am thinking of ordering one for myself. Good job. I would recommend"
4,Satisfied Customer,I thought this was a great deal. Lots of goodies to enjoy and a nice variety. The friend for whom I ordered loves to eat and like it.
4,extra gift. to keep or give,"this is a very nlce basket for the price,not as large as thought,but a very nice gift. you will enjoy it."
5,My Dad Loved it!,I got this for my dad as a birthday/appreciation gift. He said it was the best present he received and he loved it. He's so excited to eat and everything. I felt so happy to make him happy :).
1,Bad advice mixed with some good advice,"I once worked for a boss who kept a copy of this book on his desk - I hope I never work for or with anyone else who does. A book for overly aggressive, autocratic managers who view their daily interactions with people as competitions to be won or lost."
1,Audio version was not useful.,I didn't hold the title agaist this audio book but... The story did not inspire me at all and I didn't find much useful info on leading people in a management and sales enviornment.
1,Pretentious,This book was entirely too pretentious to read. He should have tried to write in the active voice and with a reasonable vocabulary. I bought it used for less than a dollar plus shipping--I got wripped off.
1,"What's next, ""Persuasion Secrets of Joseph Goebbels""?","I thought this was a joke when I heard about it. First the managerial class studied the ""Art of War"". Now they want a few more pointers from Attila the Hun? God help us!"
5,Excellent! Throw all of your other leadership books away!,"It has been a while since I have read this cover to cover, but I find myself, as a USAF officer, constantly referring to the contents of this book for guidance. The simplistic and humorous approach taken by Dr Roberts makes this a fun read and breaks down leadership into simple common sense which most people already know but don't use. Throw away all of those other complicated and over rated books that try to tell you how to get more out of people and just lead them using the information given in this book. Remember LEAD PEOPLE and manage things. It is a great gift for anyone in a leadership position. Enjoy."
4,Its about the principles of leadership,"As an Air Force enlisted member and now an officer, I've read this book several times. Its on the shelf at many of the Air Force book stores and professional development organizations because of the leadership principles the author writes about, not for its historical content. Its a good book, using Attila as the back drop, to promote sound leadership principles, tactics, and methods to help one lead and guide their section, branch, division, etc. I'm recommending this book to my sister, who's looking for leadership guidance within her organization. I recommend it to others, without hesitation."
2,Only buy it for the title,"The best part of this book may be the title, followed by the quite interesting first chapter recounting Attila's early years.The following chapters are a rehash of that history, interspersed with vague platitudes about teamwork and leadership.An amusing purchase at $0.01, but not a serious or deeply entertaining work.My greatest utility has come from showing the book to others, or referencing it while talking and being able to wave it -- as a prop, in other words."
2,"Great title, forgettable contents","I initially bought this book because the title appealed to me, and I figured at the worst it might be an interesting conversation piece. Although it has successfully filled its role as a conversation piece, as a book on leadership it is quite lacking. While I can't say I necessarily disagree with any of the advice given, none of it is presented in a very convincing or interesting way, and none of it is original or groundbreaking in any way. If you're looking for a real book on leadership, this isn't it. If you're looking for a book on Attila the Hun, this still isn't it. If however you're looking for a book to proudly display on your desk to make new hires do double takes, then this is the right book for you."
3,Tortilla the Hun,"This book made some interesting points and taught some good leadership secrets, but after a while the book becaame redundant and seemed to contradict itself in certain cases."
4,A Good Read!,"Wess Roberts draws on the life experiences of the leader of the Mongol hordes to craft imaginative monologues on leadership - an attribute as valuable today as when Attila united the Huns in 415 AD. The advice is general. Its effectiveness probably depends on how well you apply it, although the idea of a historic icon of barbaric vengeance counseling us in cultural sensitivity seems a bit of a stretch. While the treatment is certainly colorful, you might worry about ways some modern-day chieftains could misuse Roberts' principles to justify their own Visigoth approach to management. We from getAbstract recommend this book to those looking for new and interesting ways to approach the perpetual management issues of team-building, inspiring loyalty, setting goals, and achieving objectives."
3,Could be better.,"The initial steps taken by the author to validate his reasons for profiling Attilla are informative and historically accurate, however, there seems to be an underlying desire to parallel Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"". The conclusions offered by the author are somewhat vague while the ""pearls of wisdom are brief. Overall, Sun Tzu did a much better job centuries before."
1,Disliked this book,"I found it appalling to glorify a character like Attila the Hun as an example of leadership and found the many lists in the book quite boring. Attila left no seeds of growth, he motivated soley through material gain, and his empire died with him. These really are not the signs of a remarkable leader. I sincerely hope this book does not inspire future leadership writings guised behind other abhorable characters; this would serve a great injustice on young, impressionable minds."
1,Great work if you can get it,"What a country this is! How else to explain this book? Take an historical figure about whom little is known, ascribe certain banalities about leadership to him, jazz it up with some colorful language, set it in a guidebook format with short chapters and lots of bullets--and sell huge numbers of copies! Get Ross Perot to endorse it!This book cries out for a spoof--heck, it already seems like a spoof. I'm thinking of taking a few days to write ""Leadership Secrets of Spongebob Squarepants"" and see how it sells."
3,3 Stars for Attila,Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun is a great book. It contains a good combination of ancient history and modern management. Wess Roberts uses a fresh and entertaining approach. It was unlike any business related book I have read. It was like reading a story book. It was really interesting and very enlightening. The concepts were presented in a clear and easy to understand manner. The ideas were somewhat basic but they prove to be essential.
3,EXCELLENT LEADERSHIP BOOK,This book offers a no frills and unorthodox view on leadership practices. I recommend this book to any one that is tired of the chop shop run of th emill leadership book. Quick read.
2,Saturday Morning Cartoons (DVD),"I was hoping to see more earlier cartoons by Hanna-Barbera since I grew up in the 50's. However if you grew up in the 70's, this DVD is for you."
2,where is the Herculoids complete set??,All i want is a complete set of Herculoids. it sucks that all we get here is one show. been waiting years for something herculoids to come out and now i finally get 1 episode. i want them all!!! please :)
1,....Ill Conceived...,"...Slap Dash Clap Trap..Many Episodes Already Released Elsewhere..Shame On Warners For Ripping Of The Folks Who Always Get The Short Schrift..!. Ya, We Bought Both Sets For About 25% Of The Content..!.Take A Pass On This Crap..!..@ Warners..PAY ATTENTION TO THE COLLECTORS..!..Ya Maroons..!....""That's All Folks""...."
2,Disappointed,"I have ordered this DVDSaturday Morning Cartoons: 1960s Vol. 1out of sheer nostalgia for the first wave of humorous, witty, gently funny Hannah-Barbera cartoons. They stand miles above today's viscious, badly drawn, stupid cartoon-lookalikes. The cover promised a few all-time favorites such as Quickdraw McGraw, but sadly, there was only ONE Quickdraw film in the whole show -- and no Huckleberry Hound, no Yogi Bear, no Mr. Jinx, etc. In one segment there was a round table discussion of experts on the creation and uniqueness of the Quickdraw series, but it did not make up for the absence of at least 2 or 3 more of the real thing itself. Even Top Cat, who did make a very funny appearance, was no substitute for the above stars."
3,Saturday Morning Cartoons:1960s Vol.1,"I expected a little more from this DVD release,it seems likely certain cartoons were edited out of this collection,and the quality can vary sometimes depending on the film/audio elements used throughout.These classic cartoons need,and deserve,a better,superior home video release.Most of the main cartoons are clear,with good color,good focus,clean images,with only a blemish,line,or scratch,here and there.The sound was not that bad,either.My favorites in this collection are the 2 ""Space Ghost"",""Dino Boy"",and the 2 ""Herculiods""[I had not seen these in many years!],I prefer and admire realistic looking animation,not the ""CARTOONY""look.All in all,a nice enough collection,but it could have been much better,so instead of 5 stars,it just gets 3 stars instead."
3,HIT AND MISS,"Your enjoyment will be dependent on how many of the cartoons we among your favourites.I liked the ones such as Looney Tunes, Quick Draw (a long remembered fave) Magilla, Secret Squirrel. Marine Boy and Herculoids not so much. All in all not bad, the contents of Vol 2 seem better with Bugs Bunny and Road Runner shows."
5,AMERICAN CLASSIC,This book should be given to every student in the African American community. It is rich and full of insight. Every chapter is an ah moment. Some books ask the question this book gives the answer and challenges the reader to be apart of the answer.
4,*Warning* Stay Away from New Version with Stanley Crouch intro,"It's way beyond disconcerting having to read a reactionary hack like Stanley Crouch sneak his introduction into a book like Harold Cruse's ""Crisis of a the Negro Intellectual"". In trying to co-opt and explain away the radical thought Cruse exemplifies, Crouch comes off as an interloper trying to mute the legacy of an independent intellectual giant.I prefer any version of this classic other than this latest New York Review of Books printing which gives an unoriginal literary lemur like Crouch free reign to propagandize his views into legitimacy. Get your hands on an ""Apollo Edition"" or the version published by ""Quill""!! Stanley Crouch could easily find a home for his essay in the neo-liberal journal of his choice, but including his introduction as part of the book itself is a travesty. It's the intellectual equivalent of having had Martin Luther King Jr. write the introduction to Frantz Fanon's ""Wretched of the Earth."""
2,Has the well run dry?,"""Raining on Sunday"" is mid-temp shlock and ""I'm In"" is a melodic rip-off of Darden Smith's semi-hit ""Little Victories."" The album lacks the spark of Radney's earlier solo work.Radney is trying too hard. Just let it rip --stop trying to make it perfect."
2,Found this cd to be slow and draggy.,"I was disappointed by the music quality of this cd, plus the words of every song. Couldn't find one song that sounded anything like Del Rio, or Labor of Love. I have always enjoyed Radney Foster's voice and tone and been a great fan all the way back to Foster and Lloyd but it is completely lost on this cd. I still remain a fan of Radney's old music."
4,Country music at its finest...,"This album earns Radney a pardon from the absolutely awful mess that was 'Labor of Love'. In this effort he returns to his roots and offers a brilliant collection of songs on par with his first solo album (Del Rio, TX 1959). Hopefully, he'll abandon further attempts to break into country top 40 radio play and settle in among an elite peer group of singer songer writers (Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen, Kieran Kane, Kevin Welch, and a scant few others)."
3,A BIG departure from his last two solo CDs,"First let me say that the first two tracks (I've Got A Picture & I'm In)are classic Radney Foster. The rest of the album leaves something to be desired. I'm not saying that they are bad, but they sound so different than his previous two albums. I wanted songs like ""Labor Of Love"" and ""Nobody Wins"" but didn't get them. Expect more off the wall type songs that are not really country, pop, or rock, but in a genre all their own. But I still find my self listening to his two other great albums much more than this one. I give ""Labor Of Love"" 5 stars and ""Del Rio, TX 1959"" a 4."
5,Great to see Radney back...,"I love the new direction that Radney is going in. It takes alot to step up and deliver something new and fresh and I think he is successful. Alot of people complain when an artist rests on their laurels and some complain when they try something new....but Radney succeeds in his new 'personal' venture. It seems like he's been through alot on the last four years and put those new lyrics, sounds, and experiences into a great CD. Cheers!"
5,Good book to read,"In the book Jaguar there is a boy and his dad was a scientist and he studied Jaguars. His dad had to go to Brazil and he had to stay with his grandpa in a retirement home. A few months later he got a letter from his dad saying that he could come down to Brazil to find out what happened in Brazil, you'll have to read the book."
4,"Fun, Interesting!!","This book is a pretty well written. When you read it, it goes by fast...I mean it's not a slow book. It's short, and I would recommend it to you."
3,"A good book, but not the best",This book is a so-so book. It is pretty interesting but it sort of dragged on and on!! This book overall could have had a little less detail and little MORE plot!!
5,"Mona is the modern day, caped Scooby Doo.","My daughter is 3. We had a hard time making childrens cartoons appealing for her, so I ventured out and bought the Bunch of Munsch dvd at the store hoping it would interest her as she liked 'Busy Town.' It was a hit but not only for the movie, but for the fact in the previews there was a cute little girl in a vampire costume that has a very CATCHY theme song. My little girl had to have it, so I bought her the first series of Mona the Vampire for Christmas. Not only is it intellectually stimulating, fun, and helps problem solve, but it totally enhances the imagination. I recommend this for all the parents out there that have children that bore easy to the mundane nature of tv broadcasted childrens cartoons."
5,Wonderfully written - readers can relate to what happens!,"Simply spectacular! The author truly explains the feeling of jealousy. This book is so emotionally touching, it made me cry. Any book that makes me cry is a sensational book! I suggest you run to your bookstore this minute and grab it oof the shelf!"
5,Breathtaking,I think that this book truly looks through the spirit of the charecter.It greatly expresses deep emotions of the elder twin.All her anger and jeliousy in the end blooms into a inteligent and independent woman.
3,1 great movie & 2 good ones!,The Big Wheel is the best of the 3. Good acting by all the stars & plenty of that edge of your seat exciting auto racing! Bought this disc because of this movie as I like Mickey Rooney and he was very good in this role.Hot Rod Girl is part drag racing part teanage JD movie. It was interesting to watch. Decent acting by all.Fast And The Furious is the Roger Corman 1954 original about a man who breaks out of jail then joins a race to Mexico in order to not get caught by the police.All 3 movies are in black & white and seem to come from 16mm sources. Expect mono sound and some scratches and occasional splices which are very normal for older film prints.Sound is very good on this DVD but the picture looks slightly soft (like VHS does) due to the compression needed to fit 3 movies on one disc. Still I enjoyed watching this disc and I'm sure you will to if your a racing fan as I am.
4,"Cars, Cars, Cars","The other reviewers focus on this DVD's technical aspects. If you were raised on over-the-air B/W TV, as I was, these films look fine. Hey, you can pause on any frame and there are no ""commercial breaks.""This compliation provides many interesting historical insights. Of particular interest are the productions, the cast, and most of all, the cars.Scene after scene is filled with vintage cars in action. The technical aspects and actors take a ""back seat"" to the cars. Anyone with an interest in vintage British Sports, Indy, or Hot Rod cars will find this compliation well worth the small price of admission."
3,"The Big Wheel, Good Times DVD.",This DVD is NOT closed captioned as posted in the item description. I kept it anyway as was so inexpensive.
4,The Fast and the Funniest,"I really bought this set of three movies for The Big Wheel. It's got some great footage of dirt track racing from the early 50s. And, the Mickey Rooney wild-kid-bad kid-good kid story is predictable, but fun. The Roger Corman ""Fast and Furious"" is just achingly awful. The acting and film style make it look like deleted scenes from Dawn of the Dead. Racing? Where? Hot Rod Girl, I'm still working up the courage to hit play. Buy the set -- watch The Big Wheel."
4,Great Racing Movies,The picture quality was quite suprizing due to the age of the movies on this dvd. I had bought this dvd just for the one movie; the Big Wheel and had never saw the other two movies on this dvd and I really enjoyed them. These are movies that will hold the interest of any viewer.
4,Pramodya continues his discovery of the human rationale,"The Fugitive was Pramodya's first major novel. It takes place in Indoneisa during the final days of WW II. It is a story about war, nationalism, betrayal and not least human rationale and feelings. It tells the timeless story of a soldiers return. It combines political and social criticism with a tautly emontional narrative. It is a gripping story allowing us to peak into a contemporary Indonesia and a time that was a turning point for the Indonesia we see today. Pramodya is a truly amasing author, and his books has been a true gift in adding another tool to understand the human rationale. I am looking forward to read new books by Pramodya, who is working on a collection of the history of Indonesia at present."
1,Predictable with Flat Characters,I read this book out of obligation as I'm now in Indonesia. I've made myself finish it. I found the dialog false and the characters flat. Every event seems contrived. It's like a puppet show with the strings and less than masterful puppeteer quite visable.
5,Excelent insight into the making of John Wayne's epic film.,This is one of the greatest books concerning the making of Alamo movies. Full of rare pictures and interesting stories behind the making of the epic film. This is one you won't want to pass up
3,"production values great, davis not a good comic actress","The story has possibilities. The production values are great. Bette Davis was a fine dramatic actress (excusing her obvious mannerisms....twitching, clipped speech, hand wringing), but a comedienne??????? That is a laugh in itself. Only die hard Bette Davis fan will never admit the truth about Bette Davis. When it came to comedy, she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Other than that, this movie is a cute romp, mainly because of the production values and Robert Montgomery's performance."
5,"Doggone it, I like this movie!","Absolutely hilarious. And, painfully true.Anyone who has gone through any kind of recovery program can identify with the humour of Stuart Saves His Family.Great stuff. Al Franken is a genius. My favorite scene is when Stuart in a fit of depression, holes up in bed with packages of cookies.Excellent..."
5,Unbelievably funny.,"I almost didn't watch it because I thought the skit was only moderately funny on SNL. But I have to say, the movie is just hysterical. I've seen it 5 times and I thought it was just as funny the 5th as the 1st."
5,This is my 3rd copy of this movie!,"I think it is interesting that you either love this movie or think it is ridiculous. When you see how sincere Al Franken plays Stuart, you know he had to have been ""there"" with the rest of us therapy-bound human beings. The other copies I have bought I gave to friends on the condition that if they liked it, they kept it, if not, give it back to me. If there was a Stuart Smalley show airing on TV, just think how us needy people would love it. Signed, Large and Lovely in Redmond, WA"
4,Give this one a chance!,"Saw this movie by chance last night and made me laugh more than I have laughed at a movie in a long time. A little smarmy at times but with a big laugh or a surprising meaningful message at after the smarm! If you grew up in or near a dysfunctional family, watch this movie...you will probably relate and sometimes ya just gotta laugh!"
5,A Jewel of a Movie,"It's sad when I mention scenes in this movie at work and I get a ""huh?"" Very few people has bothered to see this movie and I think they're missing something. I found it poignant, funny and subtle. It it has some of the best one-liners and a rather sad but well written ending. Any grown-up out there (belonging to a dysfunctional family) still trying to stay with the concept of ""family holiday gathering"" should do what Stuart ultimately did in the end."
4,GREAT MOVIE - ORIGINALLY ADVERTISED TO THE WRONG GROUP,"My wife and I accidentally went to see this movie. I had thought it was going to be a ""Saturday Night Live"" spin off movie and was not really in the mood at the time for that type of movie. I did like the ""Waynes World"" movies and ""Stuart . . . "" was advertised to be along those lines. It actually is a quite serious movie with great comedic relief. I have suggested it to my friends and everyone of them have enjoyed it. But I was careful to explain to them that the movie was not a comedy but more of a drama/comedy. If you liked ""Home for the Holidays"" you will like ""Stuart Saves His Family""."
4,Every bit as funny as I remembered!,"This movie deserves to be a comedy cult classic. The Smalley family is as familiar as, well, your own, and the way the movie reveals their dysfunction is pitch perfect. Team up lively writing, a great cast, and the right balance of heartwarming and sarcastic humor, and you have Stuart Saves His Family."
3,"Good enough, smart enough, and doggone it it was funny!","I had extremely low expectations for Stuart (probably lower than those of the self-help addict Stuart Smalley himself). Normally I can't tolerate much of Al Franken and the later 90s SNL spinoff movies, but Stuart had way more good than bad going for it. I thought Harris Yulin, Shirley Knight, Lesley Boone and Vincent D'Onofrio were perfectly cast as Mom, Dad, Sister Jodie and Big Brother Donnie. The script could have been better, and the laughs could have been more plentiful but there were enough of them to keep me watching. Stuart's no Blues Brothers or Wayne's World but you may find you like it well enough if you give it a try."
4,It's Doc's life!,"""IT'S MY LIFE"" is one of the most significant songs of the 90's in Europe.Heavy bass line and chorus sung by a woman became a common thing for majority of songs labelled as ""eurodisco"".This german release offers 3 versions:- radio edit- extended (which, in fact, differs from the radio mix on many levels; the weakest remix of all 3)- extended radio (with intro, longer middle section and outro; great for a dancefloor)Pure entertaiment."
5,"Eddie Muller, King of Noir, strikes again!","I have long been a fan of Eddie's work on film noir as well as his fiction. No movie buff should be without a copy of ""Dark City."" His new book on film noir posters, ""The Art of Noir,"" has not disappointed.""The Art of Noir"" is as comprehensive as it is beautiful. This oversized coffee table book gives reader an up-close and lush look at the artwork of classic film noir posters. The book includes posters, lobby cards, and non-tradtional posters (6 sheets, 3 sheets, etc.)as well as both American and international posters. Eddie's commentary offers wonderful insight into the genre and this art.I highly recommend this book!"
5,Great Gift,"Chose this as a gift for someone special and it went over HUGE. I highly endorse this book, and it's a gift that is sure to impress."
5,Thorough and Insightful,It was a great read! If you are a FAN of Southern Gospel Music then this will enlighten you on how it all came into being. You will not be disappointed with the information you find here.
5,GREAT MUSIC!,"I BOUGHT THIS CD AFTER CHECKING OUT OZOMATLI WEBSITE AND THIS WAS ONE OF OZOMATLI'S FAVORITE BANDS. DAYUMM--THIS CD IS GREAT! REMINDS ME OF THE ROOTS WITH THEIR MUSICIANSHIP. THIER LAID BACK VIBE IS SO EASY TO GET INTO--I EVEN LISTEN TO THE CD WHILE I'M WORKING. HOLLAR! GET THIS CD AND CHILL! YOU WILL TRULY ENJOY, LIKE I DO EVERYTIME I LISTEN TO THIS CD! 5 STARS NOT GOOD ENOUGH RATING TO THIS GREAT CD! ************************"
2,Could have bought cheaper product from Wal-Mart Automotive,The product doesn't do what it is advertised to do. My car has a few rust spots that I needed to fix so that it didn't get worse. I followed the directions to the t including the sanding and coats. I did about 3-4 coats and the only part of the metal that turned black as advertised was the bare metal that didn't have any rust to begin with. The light rust that remained didn't change any color. Overall a waste of money. Walt-Mart sells similar types of this product for less than $4.00.
5,Does a great job,"I can highly recommend this rust treatment. Just sand/grind/blast the rusty spots to remove all the loose rust & spray them with this. It leaves a good surface that can be primed, sanded, & painted."
4,It works overall,"Used to refurbish our suburban. As other reviewers stated it may take multiple coats. The trick is to get rid of as much surface rust as possible before application. If you spray it on badly rusted steel without doing a good job of wire brushing, you'll be putting on multiple applications till your done. Works great on surface rust. Not sure about longevity yet, we'll have to wait and see, but the stuff is pretty amazing overall on what I could salvage. Just sand it down first."
2,Didn't work like it should,I sprayed couples of layers of this product like tghe label said...still waiting for the black coat!I guess I need to put more coats(going thru number 5)...
2,sticky hair,"This product acts like a hairspray. I love the other ISO products I've tried, but this one leaves hair sticky and crunchy."
1,ISO Bouncy Spray 8.5oz,"This product did not work for me. I have very fine hair and for some reason the product made my hair stick together and look oily. After paying more than I would have paid for a similar product at the salon (by the time I paid sh),I threw away over three-fourths of the bottle. It was just too sticky."
5,It worked,"What can you say about an aluminum downspout extension? It was inexpensive and did the job beautifully. The ribbing matched the rest of my Amerimax downspout. Once it was painted to match, it looked exactly like the original."

2,Pure Terror? More like pure torture.......,"I love cheesy horror movies as a rule, but there are very few films in this set worth watching. I suppose 5 or 6 watchable movies for $15 isn't unreasonable, but having to wade through 45 turkeys to come up with a few hours of worthwhile watching is too much like work."
2,Bad Transfers,"Most of these movies show horribly. It was not a good transfer at all. The color was destorted along with terrible picture quality. These movies were good back in the day, but watching them caused me some eye strain. It was not enjoyable at all. I have not gone back to watch any movie so far. Shame on the company for doing such a bad picture quality. I've seen better turn outs than this before."
3,bargain,"this set is worth its salt. lot of titles I had heard about but never watched. these will keep me entertained for months. I have only a year left to live due to illness. so these will help me through. yes, some have drop outs but even the premium discs sometimes glitch."
3,Worth the money.,"If you are a fan of old drive-in movies, you will enjoy this set. Be aware that a lot of these films have never had a ""legitimate video release, so the quality is a star below VHS on those. There are a lot that are also of dvd quality so don't be scared away by the VHS comment. Don't worry. You'll get your money's worth!"
4,what you'd expect,"A mix of 50 horror movies from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. All b-movies. Don't expect Bride Of Frankenstein or Texas Chainsaw. These are mostly movies noone gives a crap about but who cares? These are fun. A few are complete crap and hard to sit all the way and a few are amazing and worth the price of the whole pakc alone but the majority are just ok. If you're into b-movie classic horror, slasher, and sci-fi you won't be dissapointed. I haven't watched all of them but so far the highlights are House By The Cemetary, The Embalmer, and The Undertaker And His Pals. The low points have been They Saved Hitlers Brain (with a name like that I expected a lot more) and ofcourse who could sit through Manos: Hands Of Fate? Most of this isn't scary but its fun and is good to have around for horror fans."
4,Expensive,"I originally bought this item because I was in need of a 1/4"" square drive adapter for my cordless drill. This was the first thing that I found, and felt that the added screwdriver bits would be nice.The bits look top notch. I don't know much about this company, but their bits looked great. I have used them when building a few book cases and they performed well. The angel of the phillips screwbits looked, felt, and worked great!The Sockets, on the other hand, looked kind of second rate. I haven't used them yet, but they appear cheap. However, i wasn't buying this for the sockets so i can't complain that much.The 1/4"" adapter works great. Does what its supposed to.No Case or anything. Fine.I think that this was a little overpriced for what you get, but time will tell if they last, and if they do, then it will be worth it."
4,The drummer gives me nightmares,"this cd freaking rocks i reccomend it to any fan of jericho, grade, small brown bike, hot water music and so on. i saw them live a few weeks ago and it was wonderful. the 2 singers were great and the drummer was the scariest man ive ever seen. he just slammed his drums and looked into the crown the whole time, giving probably about 75% of the people nightmares that night, including me. all and all buy this CD or die."
5,Five Potatoes,I think this is the funniest book I have ever read. I recommend it to anyone wanting a good laugh.
1,Do yourself a favor and do your homework,"Lots of people get caught up in gadgetry. Go to your local supply house (woodcraft.... ) or stop by any furniture making shop and see how many of them have this in their shop. NONE all of these type jigs are junk and UNSAFE. As with many jigs you are better off making your own. It will be SAFER, more reliable and more consistent."
3,"good animation, hard to follow story",The story in this one was kind of hard to follow in my opinion. I found myself getting a little bored because i just didn't see where they were going with the story. The plus of the dvd is the anime was pretty good. The animation was the only thing that would draw me back in when i found that i was drifting due to a poor story.
3,Too Early To Tell...,"It's perhaps a bit unfair to judge a series by the first five episodes, but here goes: DARKER THAN BLACK, from what I've seen so far, strikes me the same way that several other series distributed by Funimation do: Nice to look at, with good character design and animation, but a less-than-memorable story. The gist of that story has been described elsewhere, so I'll skip that, and state that I would like to see further episodes so that I can make up my mind as to whether or not I like the series enough to get them all...as stated above, it's really too early to tell. The DVD quality is certainly fine, and I like the voice test tracks in the Special section. BCI, the parent company to Funimation, has released many fine DVDs in the past few years, especially for fans of Japanese films. They deserve our support."
4,"fantastically original, a breath of fresh air","This album is a mix of acoustic guitars, wah wah boxes, and a touch hippie style. It is a breath of fresh air in a music world dominatied by the rock/rap bands. If your looking for a new musical artist with soul and emotion, look no further."
4,Super Cute!,"This English Bulldog is super cute and very life like. Although, it's colors in the picture look more vivid than the actual product. Expect to receive a TAN and white dog and the black detailing to be a little less than the picture. Overall, I recommend this Plush."
